   Iraq will have until Jan. 15 to withdraw
its troops from Kuwait before it faces the prospect of
U.N.-authorized military action, the Soviet U.N. ambassador said
Tuesday.
   ``Yes, it's going to be the 15th,'' Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov
replied when asked if there was a consensus among the five
permanent members of the Security Council on a resolution.
   But Wednesday in Beijing, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
China will not vote for the U.N. resolution.
   Qian, however, refused to say whether China will veto the
resolution, expected to come to a vote on Thursday, or abstain.
   As one of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
China has veto power over any resolution. It has voted for all 10
previous resolutions that seek to pressure Iraq to end its nearly
4-month-old occupation of Kuwait, but has said it does not want
force used.
   ``It has always been the position of China to call for a
peaceful settlement,'' Qian told reporters at the Beijing airport
while preparing to leave for the United States to cast China's
vote.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze fixed the deadline in the last 24
hours, said Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The measure will authorize ``all necessary means'' to get Iraq
out of Kuwait after that deadline. The date after which a military
strike could begin had been the only unresolved issue in the draft
measure.
   The United States had already secured agreement on the overall
measure from the Soviets, French, British and - it was thought -
the Chinese. The draft resolution has more than enough pledges of
positive votes to pass when it comes before the full council.
   Most Security Council members are expected to be represented by
their foreign ministers at Thursday's meeting, with Baker
presiding.
   A resolution requires at least nine votes to pass, so long as
none of the permanent members vetoes it.
   The measure is supported by at least six of the non-permanent
council members: Canada, Finland, Romania, Ivory Coast, Zaire,
Ethiopia.
   Initially, the United States had pressed for a Jan. 1 deadline,
but the Soviets wanted it set at Jan. 31 to allow more time for
diplomatic maneuvers.
   U.S. reinforcements on their way to the Persian Gulf will not be
ready for a military strike before late January or February in any
case, diplomats said.
   The measure would call on Iraq to release all foreign hostages,
withdraw its troops and restore Kuwait's government by Jan. 15.
   If Iraq fails to comply, it would authorize ``member states
cooperating with the government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary
means to uphold and implement the Security Council resolutions
passed in response to Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, and
to restore international peace and security.''
   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which
authorizes the use of military force to counter aggression if
sanctions and other steps fail.
   The only other time military force was sanctioned by the United
Nations to counter aggression was in 1950, during the Korean
conflict.
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon said his country could not
support it. Yemen, the council's only Arab member, is believed
likely to abstain or vote against it.
   Malaysia and Colombia's votes are uncertain. Colombia's foreign
minister said Tuesday his government was still undecided.

   The campaign season for local government offices
in Beijing opened with plenty of hoopla. The city Communist Party
chief shook hands at the main department store.
   A brass band played. Vans with loudspeakers cruised city streets
and, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, volunteers gave out
1 million pamphlets.
   Only the candidates were missing.
   They are chosen weeks later, but there is no suspense for
voters. Only members or supporters of the ruling party are
nominated. Incumbents who supported last year's pro-democracy
movement already have been purged.
   ``It's like taking part in a play ... performed for the
Communist Party,'' a woman voter said, on condition of anonymity.
``We don't put much value on our voting rights.''
   For the Communists, the elections are a deadly serious play, the
basis of their claim to be the people's choice.
   All other officials are appointed in some fashion, so China's
assertion of democracy rests entirely upon popular elections held
every three years for the lowest-level representative bodies:
district people's congresses in urban areas and county people's
congresses in the countryside.
   The congresses make no laws and function mainly as conduits for
passing citizen complaints and ideas to higher levels. Beijing has
18 such congresses with a total of 17,000 delegates.
   Other parts of the country held elections in the spring, but
balloting in Beijing was delayed until Dec. 26. The reason given
was that everyone was too busy getting ready for the Asian Games,
held in September.
   Officials also may have wanted to keep the elections from
coinciding with the anniversary of Beijing's massive pro-democracy
demonstrations, which the army crushed in June 1989. Among other
things, the marchers wanted more say in picking government
officials.
   Voters say they have little part even in choosing the local
congresses. ``God knows how the candidates are chosen,'' the woman
said.
   After the single burst of citywide publicity that opened the
election season in late October, preparations reverted to
closed-door committees that take nominations from such official
groups as the Communist Youth League and All-China Women's
Association.
   A group of at least 10 voters can put a candidate forward, but
few do. The candidate would be unable to organize publicity
activities and would have little chance of success.
   The law allows two candidates for each seat, but voters say
there usually is just one.
   Because there are no competing parties, television ads or
debates, campaigns are placid events. It is not mandatory to vote,
but failure to do so is frowned upon and would be noticed.
   Chinese officials insist the system is more democratic than
multiparty elections in the West, which they say keeps power in the
hands of the rich.
   ``Our election rights may not be the same as in the West, but
equality is a basic principle,'' Xu Jingyu, chairman of the
election commission in Beijing's Chaoyang District, said in an
interview.
   He acknowleged not everyone can run for office, only those with
correct ideological views, but said this was in keeping with the
constitution.
   ``Delegates have to be able to represent the views of the
masses,'' he said. ``How can someone who opposes the (party's) four
basic principles do that?''
   The emphasis on ideological correctness is especially strong
this year, in keeping with the country's conservative turn after
the democracy movement was crushed.
   A public notice addressed to ``comrade voters'' in the Chaoyang
District called for vigilence against ``bourgeois liberals'' who
might seek to sabotage the election. There have been no reports of
any such plots.
   ``Bourgeois liberals'' are people who favor Western-style
democracy with more than one party.
   Xu was unable to explain why some people accused of being
bourgeois liberals were elected to past people's congresses.
   The most prominent example is astrophysicist Fang Lizhi's wife,
Li Shuxian, a physics teacher at Beijing University who shares her
husband's dissident views and was elected in 1987.
   She was expelled from the Haidian District People's Congress in
1989, soon after police accused her and Fang of
counterrevolutionary crimes. They since have been allowed to go to
the West.
   ``People change,'' Xu said. ``Maybe when she was elected, she
didn't have this problem.''

<HEAD>Freebie Flights Could Hurt Ailing Airlines If They Don't Show

   Airlines offering two tickets for the price of
one may be setting the stage for what could escalate into a
damaging fare war. But analysts say the carriers can minimize risks
if they limit freebie flights.
   ``Things like this tend to spread like wildfire,'' said Raymond
E. Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. ``If they
can control the number of seats with black-out periods, then the
damage can be controlled.''
   The latest gimmick for filling seats comes as airlines have been
hit hard by rising fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis
and a downturn in the economy that has kept demand for air travel
sluggish.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August and oil prices spiraled
upward, airlines initiated three sets of fare increases that
totaled about 15 percent.
   But now, most if not all of the airlines are fighting for
passengers through limited promotions that offer two seats for the
price of one for some flights. Tickets must be purchased by Friday,
although many are good for trips through the end of February.
   Travel agents caution that the free flights are hard to get and
blackout periods are in effect during the holidays' heaviest travel
days. Travelers should be extremely flexible about arrival and
departure dates if they want to get the fares.
   ``They're few and far between,'' said William Cooper, president
of Adventure Travels in Pompano Beach, Fla. ``You're talking about
coming into the Christmas season. If you're going out of here on
December 21st, it's almost impossible to get a seat.''
   For example, someone wanting to get the bargain rates around
Christmas might end up flying at an odd hour on Christmas Day
itself, he said.
   Cooper pointed out that the freebies weren't offered until many
travelers had already booked their holiday trips. Anyone who
already has tickets would have to determine whether it would be
worth taking a penalty by changing reservations and going for the
free flights, he said.
   The freebies have caused some confusion among travelers who
often get the false impression that lots of seats are available
under any airline promotion. Cooper said one of his agents spent
three to four hours trying to get a customer a cheap seat last
week, to no avail.
   Two of the larger, healthier carriers, American and United,
fired some of the early rounds in the battle, which could
eventually hurt the weaker carriers if things get out of control,
analysts said. In the early stages of the promotion, airlines were
offering $25 tickets for companions of people who flew at full
price.
   It soon became a free companion ticket.
   As an example of how quickly airlines respond to cheaper fares
offered by a competitor, Continental had separate advertisements
appearing in two New York City newspapers one day last week, with
one offering a companion ticket for $25 and the other offering it
for free.
   The airline's cheap-fare strategy had been shifted too quickly
for the outdated ad to be replaced by the new one, a spokesman
said.
   An all-out fare war could prompt more restructuring in the
industry like the job cuts and asset sales that have followed the
recent runup in fuel costs. In one of the most dramatic moves so
far, Pan Am Corp. agreed to sell United Airlines five prized London
routes for $400 million.
   ``The stronger guys have more staying power,'' Neidl said.
   Thomas Canning, an airline analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's, does
not foresee the cheap seats having any major impact on the
industry.
   ``As in all of these things, the seats are limited,'' he said.
``It's going to have some effect. I don't think it will be
disastrous.''

<DATELINE>MASSUA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of bloody border
incidents has given Israelis a feeling that their frontiers are
closing in on them.
   In the latest attack, a gunman crossed the Egyptian border north
of the Red Sea port of Eilat on Sunday and killed four Israelis on
a desert road. It shocked Israelis, who have grown used to the
11-year-old formal peace on the Egyptian front.
   On the Jordan border, where an unofficial peace has reigned
since 1971, guerrillas have killed two Israeli soldiers this month.
The raids have raised concerns here that King Hussein of Jordan is
losing control of the extremists in his midst.
   On Saturday night, an Israeli gunboat sank a dinghy which the
army said was ferrying gunmen from Lebanon to Israel. Hours later,
the army said, a woman with explosives strapped to her body blew
herself up next to an Israeli army patrol in south Lebanon,
wounding two soldiers.
   The Lebanon front has long been Israel's most troublesome
border. But now that Syria controls Lebanon, Israel worries about
losing its self-declared security strip in southern Lebanon.
   At Massua, an Israeli farming settlement in the occupied West
Bank 15 miles north of Jericho, the tension is inescapable.
   Two miles from here, a Jordanian teen-ager crept across the
Jordan River one November night, shot dead the Israeli guarding a
forward emplacement and would have killed more soldiers had one not
clubbed him into submission.
   The Israelis' obvious state of unreadiness reflected how much
Israel has come to take the peace on this border for granted. It
has since moved in better-trained forces, but ``we definitely
expect more of the same,'' says Yossi Olmert, director of the
Government Press Office.
   ``This past summer things have gotten worse and worse. It makes
us very uncomfortable,'' a Massua woman said last week as she
wrapped bunches of hothouse roses for export to Europe. She spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   That morning the settlement kept its gates shut until 9 a.m.
because a Jordanian soldier was thought to have infiltrated across
the Jordan River during the night.
   The claustrophobic atmosphere is not restricted to existing
frontiers. A wave of knife attacks on Jews led authorities to seal
off the occupied territories for four days last month, in a sense
resurrecting the pre-1967 war border between Israel and the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Tension is running particularly high in Jerusalem, Israel's
largest concentration of Jews and Arabs. It worsened dramatically
after Oct. 8, when police fired on rioting Palestinians outside
their main mosque, killing at least 17 people.
   On Friday, a satirical TV sketch featured a young Israeli with a
rucksack telling his parents he was off on an adventure. South
America? Nepal? No, Jerusalem, he replies, whereupon his mother
bursts into tears and begs him to reconsider.
   Israelis have grown used to daily Arab violence during the three
years of the Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising. But now the
tension has reached places that were supposed to be immune, such as
Eilat, the resort town 15 miles from the scene of Sunday's
shootings.
   ``We try to sell Eilat as a secure and comfortable place,'' said
Shalom Doron, an assistant hotel manager. Now he worries that
``Israelis may become as frightened to come here as they are to
come to Jerusalem.''
   Most disconcerting for Israelis is their belief that the latest
attacks are not the work of their old enemy, the PLO, but of
Islamic fundamentalists.
   They see a direct link between the rise of Moslem militancy in
Jordan and the raids across the Jordan River.
   ``The propaganda and the agitation of the Islamic forces in
Jordan has reached very dangerous proportions,'' Olmert said.
   ``One can see why there are those repeated attempts to
infiltrate into Israel from Jordan, attempts that we have no reason
to think are approved of or initiated by the regime.''
   The same goes for Egypt, he said. Despite the Cairo government's
strong commitment to the 11-year-old peace treaty, ``there is an
infrastructure of strong anti-Israeli feeling in Egypt, basically
fueled by Islamic fundamentalists.''
   The fundamentalist factor was always present, he said, but has
been accelerated by the Persian Gulf crisis, which is forcing Arabs
to take sides for or against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

   Score one more victory for equal rights: no
longer do federal prisons discriminate gainst men in deciding
whether prisoners may wear wigs.
   Under a Bureau of Prisons regulation that took effect Nov. 1,
inmates of both sexes are banned from donning hairpieces unless
they get medical authorization from the warden.
   It was one of countless changes that have been made in federal
laws and regulations to bring about equal treatment of the sexes or
to eliminate what is perceived as sexist language.
   Bureau officials say hairpieces are outlawed to prevent their
use as disguises or to conceal contraband.
   The previous regulation read:
   ``551.3 Hairpieces.
   ``(a) A female inmate may wear a wig or hairpiece.
   ``(b) A male inmate may not wear an artificial hairpiece.''
   In its notice printing the new regulation in the Federal
Register, the bureau said the change was intended ``to provide for
the security, good order, and discipline of the institution, and to
apply this provision equally to male and female inmates.''
   Occasionally, as in the wig rule, such changes do away with
discrimination against men. For the most part, however, they are
designed to assure equal rights for women.
   For instance, old rules of the Veterans' Administration, now the
Department of Veterans' Affairs, presumed that a female veteran
could be the dependent of a male veteran, but not the other way
around.
   VA spokesman Don Smith said this has been changed as part of an
effort that ``goes way back.''
   ``For the most part, VA considers that in the last decade or
decade and a half it has eliminated just about everything that
would suggest that there is a difference in benefits or services
depending on sex,'' Smith said.
   Some distinctions remain, in law if not in federal regulations
and practice.
   There is, for example, a law still on the books that calls for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs to train Indian boys as farmers and
industrial workers, and Indian girls as assistant matrons.
   Indian Affairs spokesman Tommy Garrett, however, said that this
and similar distinctions ``have been removed in an administrative
sense over the years'' or superseded by later laws.
   Phineas Indritz, a Washington lawyer who has filed briefs with
the Supreme Court in landmark sex discrimination cases, said,
``There have been a large number of substantive changes eliminating
distinctions in law, but there are still a goodly number left.''
   The law on training of Indian children was one of many that
would have been repealed by legislation introduced in the last
session of Congress, but not acted on.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a sponsor of the legislation, said
some of the laws were archaic or obsolete and others had already
been negated by agency action or court decisions.
   ``A number of these laws, however, are of continuing
applicability,'' Hatch said.
   One that is of continuing applicability bars women from combat
roles in the military. Another requires young men, but not young
women, to register under Selective Service.
   Hatch and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., steered clear of such
controversial issues in their bill.
   There also are continuing efforts to eliminate language that
suggests sexual discrimination, even though it may not exist.
   A case in point is the office of chief judge of the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals. The incumbent is named Judith Rogers,
but the D.C. code refers to the chief judge as ``he'' and ``him.''
   The Judicial Conference of the United States recently went
through the codes of practice governing federal courts to do away
with several hundred of such gender pronouns.
   ``The last time I looked at them, there was only one reference
to a gender basis,'' Indritz said.
   The code still spoke of a ship as `her.''

   Here are excerpts from the opening statement
of Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, at Monday's session of the Senate Ethics Committee.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Near the beginning of this drama, in March of 1984, Charles
Keating's American Continental Corp. bought Lincoln Savings, a
California state-chartered S&amp;L. California law then permitted
direct equity investments. Mr. Keating's S&amp;L could buy companies
and stocks, participate in leveraged buyouts, build and run hotels,
and own and operate real estate development ventures of all types.
   Mr. Keating could easily raise the funds he needed to do such
things, because Lincoln Savings, with its federally insured
deposits, was a cash cow, well able to finance these endeavors.
   In 1984, Mr. Keating, in order to gain permission to acquire
Lincoln, had assured state regulators and us that he would continue
to operate the institution as primarily a home mortgage lender.
   Despite these assurances, he soon began using California's
liberal thrift laws to their fullest. One month after Mr. Keating
acquired Lincoln, the Bank Board asked Congress to roll back state
thrift powers to the boundaries set by the Garn-St. Germain Act for
federally chartered thrifts. That's something Congress had done for
federally chartered thrifts.
   This move would have severely curtailed direct investment
authority for California thrifts, but the bank board's request went
nowhere. The Board began trying, through administrative
rule-making, to limit the investment authority granted by
California law. And Mr. Keating enlisted the first wave of paid
apologists, dedicated to preventing us from doing so. All of this
occurred before I had even heard of Charles Keating.
   The Bank Board adopted its first directed - direct investment
regulation on January 30 of 1985. It limited the amount of a
thrift's assets that could go into direct equity investment to 10
percent of assets, unless regulators permitted exceptions and - to
be granted only under specific conditions.
   By the time of our rule-making, Mr. Keating had apparently been
lobbying heavily to try to insure that the rule wouldn't be applied
against Lincoln, or that it would be scuttled by a powerful show of
force in Congress. Largely as a result of the Keating effort, more
than half the members of the House signed a resolution intended to
cause me and my colleagues to back down in the face of this
demonstration of power. We didn't, and the direct investment
regulation stood.
   Mr. Keating next sought to deal with this problem by hiring me
out of my job as his chief regulator. He did so in a personal
meeting with my chief of staff, who on my prior instructions
rejected his proposal.
   In 1986, it became clear that Mr. Keating was conducting a
campaign through its employees, agents and sympathizers to create
the impression with the media, and with other influence molders,
that I was feuding with him. Actually I've never met him, or even
seen him in person. But we began hearing and then reading that I
was somehow conducting a vendetta against Lincoln.
   A Gray-Keating feud story ran on the front page of The
Washington Post on September 20th, 1986, in which it also was
falsely alleged that I was harassing Lincoln. From that time
forward, my senior staff and I believe that the alleged Gray
vendetta was intended to be used by Keating as a basis for fighting
thrift regulators in the future.
   Vendetta accusations were not the only pressure tactics I saw in
operation that year. It was, we now know, not an accident that
opposition to my efforts to warn about growing S&amp;L problems
coincided with the appearance of critical news stories about
certain of the bank board's practices.
   When I arrived at the agency, these practices had been in place
for over a decade. The regional banks would routinely pay part of
the expenses incurred by Bank Board officials, including myself,
when we attended out-of-town conferences of the regional banks.
These practices had been approved by Bank Board counsel on more
than one occasion, and were known to the Congress.
   Despite this history, and whatever may have been the source or
motivation of the news stories, I concluded that the questions
raised in the news stories were not unreasonable, and that the
public perceptions created by the news stories were not only
hurting me, but would, even if I survived in office, destroy any
chance I might have at reforming the thrift system.
   I therefore reviewed these practices, revised them, and without
being required or asked to do so, paid back certain challenged
expenses. I also reimbursed the cost of airplane charter arranged
for me by regional bank officials on the occasion of a severe
medical emergency in my family. The total amount of the
reimbursements were approximately $27,000.
   This matter was thoroughly investigated by the Office of
Government Ethics, the Department of Justice, and the Bank Board's
Inspector General, none of whom recommended any remedial action
against me. These attacks were part of a pattern of pressures meant
to discredit and - to discredit me, and derail the effort to
achieve S&amp;L reform and protect the American taxpayers.
   Senator Cranston's opening statement signaled that some would
like this issue to play the same role at these hearings. I hope it
will not.
   In mid-1986 the terms of my two Bank Board colleagues, Mary
Grigsby and Donald Hovde were due to expire. News reports
speculated as early as August 1986 that two Keating associates,
Professor George Benston of the University of Rochester, a paid
consultant to Lincoln since 1984, and Lee Henkel, a Keating lawyer
and close associate who also was a major borrower of Lincoln's,
were being seriously considered by the White House under the
leadership of Donald Regan to fill the Grigsby and Hovde seats on
the Bank Board.

<HEAD>WASHN: bank board.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Henkel was indeed given a recess appointment for the Republican
slot on the bank board in late October of 1986. This sent a very
strong signal to me and the bank board staff that Mr. Keating had
especially heavy political clout and that he intended to use it.
   The pressures during those years came from the Hill as well as
the Executive Branch and the media - and the congressional
pressures were the heaviest of all.
   Beginning in 1985 I'd been asking Congress for a major
recapitalization of the FSLIC (the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp.) - that was in October of 1985. Finally, in the
fall of 1986 we had a recapitalization bill moving through
Congress, inadequate as it was, but suddenly it stopped.
   Incoming Speaker (James) Wright had been told that our
regulators were being too tough on Texas S&amp;Ls owned by his
constituents and contributors, and he personally was putting a hold
on the bill until he could get some satisfaction.
   The delay was critical. It also impressed on all of us at the
bank board if we had not known it before, that congressional
consent was the key to stopping the hemorrhage, the losses to the
taxpayers.
   Board member Henkel in his first open meeting of the bank board
proposed an alternative regulation for our direct investment rule,
which was due to expire. His version would have forgiven thrifts
for certain massive violations of the grandfathering clause of the
extant direct investment regulation.
   We believed then, and I believe today, that Mr. Henkel's
regulation was specifically intended to benefit Lincoln and only
Lincoln Savings.
   Newly appointed board member Larry White and I voted against
Henkel's regulation and for renewing our direct investment rule.
Later, at the end of February of 1987 Mr. White and I voted to
strengthen the direct investment regulation very substantially by
tying a thrift's ability to make some equity investments to the
level of tangible net worth on the books of the institution.
Lincoln Savings thereupon sued the bank board on the grounds that
we had exceeded our statutory authority.
   On April 2nd, 1987, this issue of the direct investment rule
came up in my meeting with Senators DeConcini, McCain, Cranston and
Glenn, as to which I've already testified in my deposition. Today,
as we look back, it is clear many times over that the lion's share
of the staggering losses that taxpayers will have to pay are the
result of overly rapid deposit growth, fueled in large part by
money brokers, which went into equity investments, particularly
those involving speculative real estate projects.
   Charles Keating's losses from direct investments and high-risk
land loans demonstrate beyond doubt that our regulatory concerns,
our warnings, and our actions were correct. Charles Keating's
purpose for Lincoln Savings was to use the institution as a source
of funds for enterprises that had nothing to do with making home
mortgages available to those seeking the American Dream.
   But there were many other thrift managements which, to a lesser
or greater extent, were operating their thrifts for similar ends.
Lincoln was not at all unique.
   These people played their political cards like masters in order
to keep the regulators at bay. All the time, the stakes for the
taxpayers continued to go up and up and up.
   The technique did not intimidate me or my regulators, I'm proud
to say, but it visited a crushing burden on both the taxpayers and
those depositors and bond holders who had placed their trust in our
regulatory system.
   I hope this account makes clear that when I met, in 1987, with
the five senators now before this committee, we were not discussing
a normal regulatory issue to be addressed through the normal kinds
of pressure, negotiation and compromise. This was a matter of clear
and present danger to the nation, and demanded a more sober
treatment.
   We have heard a lot in these hearings about the responsibility
of senators to represent constituent interests, but I've always
assumed that we also send our senators to Washington because we
think they will have the sense to know when narrow constituent
demands must take a back seat to the safety of their constituents
as a whole.
   I hope this recounting of events also makes clear that when I
met with the five senators, it was not in the midst of a normal
political climate. These meetings capped years of private threats
and public vilification, designed not just to change particular
decisions by the bank board, but to render us unable to carry out
our central responsibilities to protect the financial system and
the taxpayers from loss. No one in Washington with the slightest
knowledge of this issue can have been ignorant of this situation or
the effect that it would have on the way regulators received and
interpreted messages from senators and congressmen.
   Finally, I hope my experience makes clear that the savings and
loan problem was not merely a problem of personal ethics among five
senators. There were hundreds of players in this political drama,
each of whom had some sort of interest in preserving the existing
system rather than changing it and reforming it, and making it
safer and more sound.
   This is the classic problem of a democracy. The private
interests fit together so closely and operate so powerfully that
the public interest - the broad public interest - the ordinary
folks out there - their interest never gets served. Perhaps this
crisis will encourage all of us to build more safeguards against
that danger in the future.
   Thank you.

   HAFR AL-BATIN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Around the dinner table under
a Bedouin tent, the Foreign Legionnaires sang of their love for the
desert and readiness to die for France.
   ``The desert's for us, as for sailors the sea,'' they roared.
``Let the sun bronze our corpses.''
   The 1,100 men of the 2nd Infantry Regiment deployed in the
northeastern Saudi Arabian desert come from 46 countries. Some
joined to flee legal problems or broken love affairs, and nearly
two-thirds use an assumed name.
   ``We never ask them why they joined the Foreign Legion,'' said
Lt. Col. Antoine Lecerf, 40.
   ``Their past is their property. Maybe they're looking for
adventure. Maybe they want to forget something in their own life.
We don't mind.''
   Americans may complain of harsh conditions waiting out Saddam
Hussein in the desert, but that's not something that's heard at the
Legion camp 65 miles south of the border with Iraqi-occupied
Kuwait.
   ``The legion was almost born in the desert,'' said Cpl. Martin
Meyer, 28, of Chicago. ``We love it out here.''
   The 2nd Infantry is part of the France's 4,000-man Rapid Action
Force, deployed alongside Arab troops in the face-off with Saddam.
   The legionnaires have seen action in Lebanon, Chad, Gabon and
other hotspots where they were sent to advance France's foreign
policy.
   Far from shunning a fight, the legionnaires look forward to it.
   ``Five years without seeing combat, and I'm still a virgin,''
said Meyer, who joined after serving in the U.S. Air Force.
``That's what I signed up for. That's what everyone signed up
for.''
   He said he preferred the legion to the U.S. military because
``It's a lot more liberal. Hey, I got my corporal's stripes because
I was thrown in the nick (jail). They don't like wimps.''
   As they wait for action, the legionnaires live with Gallic
savoir-faire.
   They have bought large Bedouin tents and Arab carpets to lay on
the sand, they drink from glasses decorated with the regimental
crest and the food is a far cry from the American MREs, or ``meals
ready to eat,'' that the GIs complain about.
   In the event of hostilities, they have packaged ready-to-warm
rations but those, too, are a lot different from American army
chow. One such ration includes ``lamb with beans, mushroom soup,
beef conserve, tunnyfish in oil, candy, caramels'' and a variety of
other goodies.
   The desert is their home.
   ``It's very beautiful,'' Lecerf said. ``You can have a constant
communion with nature. I love the desert because it's a demanding
environment that imposes a special effort from everyone.''
   Cut off from their backgrounds, the legionnaires can find a new
life among their comrades with no questions asked.
   ``Most of my friends are in jail or dead, so it was a good
move'' to sign up, said Pvt. John Garcia, 20, of the Bronx, New
York. He stressed it was his real name and that ``I'm no
criminal.''
   Asked whether he was hoping for war, he answered in his newly
learned French: ``Yes. Of course. Everyone here is.''
   The legionnaires have strips of Velcro on their uniforms for
name tags, but none of the men of the 2nd Infantry wore the tags.
Many refused to be photographed or to give their names - even
aliases.
   These days many of the new recruits come from Eastern Europe.
The legion predicts that Eastern Europeans will form the largest
minority within two years.
   It ethos hasn't changed much since the 1939 movie ``Beau Geste''
starring Gary Cooper told the story of three well-born brothers who
join the legion to escape disgrace.
   Capt. Hans Eberle, a 25-year-old legion veteran, said
``legionnaires are like modeling clay. They have to adapt.''
   Speaking French in an accent tinged with his native German and
the lilting southern accent of the legion's home base, Nimes,
Eberle acknowledged he misses his wife and three children.
   ``But in our noble profession, there are so many rewards,'' said
the 44-year-old captain, who has made hundreds of parachute jumps
with a full combat load.
   The legionnaires spend up to 300 days a year away from home base
in a totally masculine world, and they shudder at the thought that
women could ever be recruited.
   ``I love women too much to accept that they be in the legion,''
said Eberle. ``I've seen the corpses of women. It's not a pretty
sight.''
   As reporters left the Legion camp, Eberle said: ``Goodbye. See
you in Baghdad.''

<HEAD>South African Author Wins Britain's Richest Fiction Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African author J.M. Coetzee has won
Britain's richest fiction prize, the $39,000 Sunday Express Book of
the Year award, for his novel ``Age of Iron.''
   It is the first book in four years from Coetzee, who won acclaim
for his earlier novels, ``Waiting for the Barbarians'' and ``Life
and Times of Michael K.''
   ``Age of Iron'' was chosen from a short list of six.
   Others were ``Brazzaville Beach'' by William Boyd, ``Temples of
Delight'' by Barbara Trapido, Barbara Vine's ``Gallowglass'' and
two novels shortlisted for this year's Booker prize, ``Gate of
Angels'' by Penelope Fitzgerald and Brian Moore's ``Lies of
Silence.''
   ``It was a close run thing but `Age of Iron' is a story about
the triumph of the human spirit and the quality of the language
made it a winner,'' said novelist Andrea Newman, one of the five
judges.
   South African actress Janet Suzman received the award on
Coetzee's behalf Monday at a special literary luncheon at London's
Cafe Royal restaurant.
   The Sunday Express newspaper presents the award annually for
``the most enjoyable and compulsively readable book published in
Britain.''
   Written in the first person, ``Age of Iron'' takes the form of a
letter from Elizabeth Curren, a white South African, to her
daughter.
   A retired classics teacher, Elizabeth lives alone: her daughter
has lived in America since 1976, and her husband is dead.
   In a series of monologues Elizabeth considers her childhood, her
guilt over apartheid - a ``gathering feeling of walking over black
faces'' - and the growing turmoil of racially segregated South
Africa. ``a bad-tempered old hound snoozing in the doorway, taking
its time to die.''
   She wants very much to be a mother figure to those around her,
but the people with whom she becomes involved, including a vagrant
who starts to share her home and two black teen-agers - both later
killed during a school boycott - all prove to be well beyond her
emotional reach.

<HEAD>Nation in a Recession, 75 Percent of Forecasters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-five percent of the nation's top
economic forecasters contend the nation has sunk into a recession,
although two-thirds expect it to be mild and end by April,
according to a survey released today.
   ``Recession is here,'' the National Association of Business
Economists said in a report on its canvass of 51 professional
forecasters.
   The finding was a dramatic switch from an NABE survey just a
year ago, when 62 percent of the forecasters said the economy would
escape a recession through 1992. Just after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in August, 45 percent of the forecasters said a recession
either had begun or was imminent.
   Some economists on the current panel who say the downturn has
not yet begun predicted a recession would begin early next year.
   Only 15 percent of the panel continue to hold to the ``no
recession'' scenario.
   The NABE survey mirrored an earlier survey this month by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators. Eighty percent of the 52 prominent
economists participating in that study said a recession will begin
before year's end. Another five percent said it would begin in
1991.
   Virtually all of the NABE forecasters who contend the economy is
in recession say it began either in the third or the current
quarter.
   ``The recession is also expected to be mild in historical terms,
with the trough occurring in the first quarter of 1991,'' the NABE
report said. It projected economic growth to decline 1.0 percent in
the current quarter and 0.8 percent in the next.
   A recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarters of
negative growth.
   ``If the current expansion is dead, it lived a long and
prosperous life of 93 months (assuming an August peak) and was just
a year short of the longest postwar business expansion of
1961-1969,'' the report said.
   The forecasters project the economy will expand just 1 percent
for all of 1990 and 0.8 percent next year. That includes inching up
0.6 percent in the second quarter and growth of 2 percent in the
third and 2.5 percent in the fourth. The economy grew 2.5 percent
in 1989 and 4.5 percent in 1988.
   The survey also found the forecasters believe unemployment will
rise from 5.5 percent this year to 6.1 percent in 1991. The jobless
rate in October was 5.7 percent, up from 5.2 percent in June.
   At the same time, inflation as measured by the Labor
Department's Consumer Price Index will drop from 5.5 percent in
1990 to 5.2 percent in 1991. The 1990 rate forecast in the latest
survey is up from 5.3 percent in the previous survey because of
higher oil prices following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
the report said.
   Corporate profits are projected to decline 4 percent this year
and 1.3 percent in 1991. That's down from the previous survey that
forecast a 2.7 percent decline in 1990 and a 3 percent gain in
1991.
   The forecasters said the federal budget deficit will rise from
$220.4 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 to $258
billion in fiscal 1991 and $240 billion in fiscal 1992.
   The projections include the cost of the savings and loan
bailout. Excluding those costs, the deficit would be $198 billion
in the current year and $180 billion in fiscal 1992.
   The other deficit - merchandise trade - is forecast to drop to
$100 billion this year and $93 billion in 1991. The trade deficit,
which totaled $108.99 billion in 1989, has not been below $100
billion since 1983.

   About 100 people, including a number of
dignitaries, fell into a small river in Veracruz state when the
hanging bridge they were inaugurating collapsed, the independent
news agency Excelsior reported.
   About 30 people were injured, including nine who had to be
hospitalized, in Monday's accident in the eastern state, the news
agency said.
   The bridge across the La Antigua River, near the Gulf of Mexico
port of Veracruz, collapsed during the late afternoon ceremony,
said Ismael Bravo Vela, the judicial official at the village of La
Posta, the news agency reported.
   The bridge was built to link La Posta with the village of La
Antigua, across the river. Officials in both towns blamed
deficiencies in construction materials for the collapse of the
span, Excelsior said.

   A man accused of shooting his ex-wife in
the head and murdering her lover was set free after two trials in
which the defense argued the woman's memory was faulty because of
her head wound.
   George Gurney, who had spent 17 months in jail, became a free
man Monday after his second trial in five months ended in a hung
jury.
   The prosecution decided against a third trial, citing the health
of Gurney's former wife, Miriam Stoltz-Gurney. She spent four
months recovering from the February 1989 attack before identifying
Gurney as the assailant.
   ``Bringing her back, getting her ready for trial and actually
subjecting her to having to testify again not only is not helping
her rehabilitation process, it's inhibiting that process,'' said
Assistant Attorney General Michael Ramsdell.
   The defense had hammered at the reliability of Stoltz-Gurney's
memory, calling a Harvard University psychologist who testified
that people with her type of head injury sometimes create memories
to fill in gaps in their recall.
   Defense attorneys also stressed that there was no physical
evidence linking Gurney, 54, to the crime scene.
   Gurney, who did not testify, had no comment Monday.
Stoltz-Gurney, 49, was not present for the dismissal of the case.
   The jury deadlocked last week after deliberating about 14 hours.
According to one juror who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
dissenting juror doubted Stoltz-Gurney's testimony. The first trial
ended in a 6-6 deadlock in June.
   Gurney was charged with murder, attempted murder and kidnapping
in the attack that left Stoltz-Gurney in a weeklong coma and her
lover, Roger Whittemore, dead.
   Gurney, a newspaper advertising salesman, had faced life in
prison without parole.
   Stoltz-Gurney, who now lives at a Boston rehabilitation center,
had stunned doctors with her recovery. In walking to the stand, she
needed the help of a cane. At times her voice was barely audible
and she admitted her memory was spotty.
   David Davidoff, a psychologist who interviewed Stoltz-Gurney,
told the jury that she made up things to ``feel a sense of mastery
and completeness.'' He testified ``the few things she does recall
are likely to be distorted.''
   The prosecution had portrayed Gurney as a scorned lover who was
insanely jealous of Whittemore.
   Stoltz-Gurney, who had maintained a relationship with her
ex-husband since their divorce in 1986, testified that he called
the night of the murder and asked to come over. She said she told
him he couldn't because Whittemore was there.
   The next thing she remembered, she testified, was Gurney
storming into her room wearing camouflage fatigues and army boots.
She said Gurney tied a pillowcase over Whittemore's head and bound
his hands.
   ``George took a fire iron and whacked Roger with it. Roger was
screaming, `I have four children and I want to do more for them!'
'' she said. ``I was on the staircase cowering. I was really scared
about the whole thing.''
   Gurney then told her that they were going for a ride, she said.
She testified she did not remember being shot.
   Whittemore, 52, of Swampscott, Mass, was found dead and
Stoltz-Gurney was found unconscious in nearby woods.

<HEAD>Disease-Fighting Fungus Approved for Commercial Use in Greenhouses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A beneficial natural fungus that attacks two
costly plant diseases has been approved by the government for
commercial use in greenhouses.
   The Agriculture Department said the fungus, a strain of
Gliocladium virens, has been approved by the Environmental
Protection Agency as a greenhouse biological control of two harmful
fungi that cause ``damping off'' diseases.
   According to the department's Agricultural Research Service, it
is the first time in the United States a biocontrol fungus has been
approved for use against a plant disease.
   Damping-off diseases cause rotting of seeds, seedlings and
cuttings. Losses are estimated at more than $1 billion a year.
   The research service said its scientists invented and patented
the technology for formulating the good fungus - Gliocladium - into
easily applied pellets. W.R. Grace &amp; Co. was granted an exclusive
license for its use.
   Grace developed the technology further and hopes to have a
product on the market in two years. Eventually, the company said it
may seek EPA approval for using the pellets outdoors, as markets
develop.
   The research service said Monday that damping-off fungi are
attacked by the pellets - Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium ultimum.
The diseases can destroy 10 percent to 30 percent of a crop.
   Among damping-off's victims are geraniums, snapdragons,
chrysanthemums, celosia, poinsettias, cotton, corn, beans and
soybeans.
   Tests performed by USDA plant pathologists Robert D. Lumsden and
James C. Locke show plant losses caused by damping-off were reduced
by 80 percent to 95 percent, which are similar to results gained
from the use of chemical fungicides.
   The agency said further improvements are being sought to reduce
losses 95 percent or even 100 percent.
   Approval by EPA allows Gliocladium's use on any plants grown in
a greenhouse, including ornamentals and edibles such as tomatoes,
cabbage or broccoli.
   The pellets resemble granular fertilizer and are made of dormant
fungi spores, wheat bran and alginate, a natural gel-like material
that binds the particle together.
   When the pellets are moistened, the spores germinate, and the
fungus multiplies and controls the disease, the agency said.
   Gliocladium was described as ``a naturally occurring organism''
that was isolated from Maryland soil in the early 1980s at the
agency's Biocontrol of Plant Diseases Laboratory in Beltsville, Md.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department has concluded a
national hearing on possible changes in the pricing procedures
under the nation's 42 federal milk marketing orders.
   But department officials say it will be well into next year
before a final proposal can be drawn up for public comment.
   More than 10,000 pages of comments were taken from 195 witnesses
during the 43 days of testimony that began Sept. 5 in Eau Claire,
Wis., and concluded Nov. 20 in Irving, Texas.
   The department sid Monday a complete transcript of the hearing
is being compiled. Copies are expected to be available by
mid-December for public inspection at the 16 federal milk marketing
order offices across the country.
   Briefs based on the hearing record will be allowed to be filed
with USDA's hearing clerk no later than April 13, 1991. Replies
will be accepted by April 27.
   After April 27, the department will evaluate the evidence and
briefs, prepare a ``recommended decision'' on the proposals, which
will be open for public comment. After that, a ``final rule'' will
be prepared.
   ``Any changes that rule might propose would be contingent on
referendums in each milk marketing area a proposal would affect,''
the department said.
   The procedure involves the milk pricing provisions used in all
federal milk marketing orders, the system used to set minimum
prices for milk that wholesalers must pay producers.
   Although the marketing orders do not set retail milk prices, the
minimums specified at the farm level are felt through the marketing
chain.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - This year's Agriculture Department yearbook
tells about farmers and others who feed and clothe the American
people.
   The 200-page book, ``Americans in Agriculture: Portraits of
Diversity,'' is about ``the people of American agriculture, their
jobs, their lives, their goals and their families,'' said editor
Deborah Takiff Smith.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter added Monday in the book's
foreword: ``The initiative and creativity and plain hard work of
these millions of people are the key to our efficiency and our
ability to compete in the world marketplace.''
   As a special focus, the 1990 yearbook observes the centennial of
the ``1890 institutions,'' the historically black land-grant
colleges and universities. The book includes a history of these
schools and a number of profiles of scientists, farmers, teachers
and students connected with the schools.
   The USDA yearbook officially began in 1894, although annual
volumes of reports were issued in the 1840s, when federal
agriculture was under the commissioner of patents.
   Annual reports were continued after USDA was created in 1862.
Copies of the reports were distributed to Congress, a practice that
continues.
   Each senator will be getting 350 books and each member of the
House about 300. Some are also provided to committees and other
Capitol Hill offices.
   Free copies are available to constituents. Or the books can be
ordered for $10 each from the Superintendent of Documents,
Washington, D.C. 20402. The yearbooks also will be sold at
government bookstores in many cities.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
many critics underestimate the government's ability to accommodate
both the environment and the timber industry.
   ``I don't see those as nearly as incompatible as some have
suggested so far,'' he told reporters Monday.
   Yeutter said the defeat of environmental initiatives containing
``extreme positions'' in the Nov. 6 elections shows voters want
common sense approaches to the environment, including protection of
the northern spotted owl.
   The secretary criticized views of extremists on both sides of
the fight over the threatened owl's habitat, which is primarily in
the centuries-old forests of the Pacific Northwest. He also said he
expects the Forest Service's Northwest logging plans to survive
most legal challenges.
   The Forest Service, acting under the Agriculture Department, has
been forced to alter its logging plans since the Fish and Wildlife
Service declared the owl to be a threatened species in June.
   A panel of government scientists led by Forest Service biologist
Jack Ward Thomas said in April that logging must halt on 3 million
acres of Northwest federal forests to save the owl.
   But timber industry leaders say that would cost tens of
thousands of timber jobs by the end of the decade.
   ``It certainly has been politically difficult to strike a
reasonable balance in many of these areas of conflict, not just the
spotted owl, but a good number of others as well,'' Yeutter said.
   ``That is due to radical or extreme positions being held by a
number of folks in the environmental community on the one side and
sometimes equally radical or extreme positions being held by folks
on the other side,'' he said.
   Yeutter said the defeat of several environmental ballot issues,
such as California's Big Green, should provide encouragement to
policymakers at all levels of government.
   ``The voters opted for reasoned and good judgment and common
sense and they rejected a lot of proposals in early November that
would have, in my judgment, gone off into extreme positions,'' he
said.
   ``That is an encouraging illustration of democracy in action and
a sound, solid, middle-of-the-road approach emerging as a result of
the election process,'' the secretary said.

   When Philip Morris spent millions on a
high-tech, 50-state exhibition of the Bill of Rights, cynics
complained the cigarette company wanted to convey a not-so-subtle
message: One of our inalienable rights is the right to smoke.
   Now the American Lung Association of Connecticut is delivering
its own message with a no-tech, low-budget counter-exhibition of
the revered document.
   ``It's not an established right for someone to blow smoke in my
face,'' said John E. Zinn, the lung association's executive
director in Connecticut. ``What they're trying to do is perpetuate
this myth where smoking is a right and polluting other people's air
is a right.''
   Philip Morris Cos. borrowed Virginia's copy of the Bill of
Rights for a 16-month tour that began Oct. 10 to commemorate the
200th anniversary of the signing of the document.
   When the lung association heard the tour was coming to New Haven
earlier this month, members quickly arranged their own exhibit,
moving Connecticut's copy from the Connecticut State Library to the
Old State House in Hartford.
   Connecticut's copy is one of 13 given to the original states
after the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. The federal
government also has a copy, on display in Washington.
   Costs for the Philip Morris tour, including advertising and
security, are expected to top $60 million. The lung association's
month-long exhibition, which opened Friday, cost $300.
   The Philip Morris exhibition uses blue lights and loud music to
show off the Bill of Rights in an elaborate multi-media show. The
document is transported around the country in an armored car,
accompanied by a caravan of six trucks, four vans and two buses.
   Wilson H. Faude, executive director of the Old State House, used
his 1983 Nissan to transport the Bill of Rights for the lung
association's exhibition from its home at the state library. The
document is displayed in a simple glass case.
   ``There's a certain dignity surrounding the Bill of Rights,''
Zinn said. ``We'll leave the splashy demonstration to them.''
   Philip Morris, a conglomerate that also owns Kraft General Foods
and Miller Brewing Co., denied it wanted to make a statement about
smoking.
   ``There's absolutely nothing in the tour that promotes any of
our products, nothing whatsoever, and how touring the Bill of
Rights is going to fight smoking restrictions is beyond me,'' said
the company's Mary Taylor.
   Anti-smoking groups or gay activists angered by the company's
support of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., have protested the Philip
Morris tour at stops in Barre, Vt.; West Warwick, R.I.; Augusta,
Maine; New Haven; Albany, N.Y., and Boston.
   Visitors at the lung association's exhibition on Monday were
divided over the Philip Morris tour.
   ``I'm against smoking, but the fact is, nobody's asking people
to smoke just because they come see this,'' said Peter Ottaviano, a
Hartford insurance agent.
   ``It's their right to sponsor it, but I think their motives are
questionable,'' said Val Pajer of Durham. ``Something like this,
something that's part of our heritage, should not be connected with
a profit-making motive.''
   Faude said the controversy probably has helped boost attendance
at the Connecticut exhibit. In three days, it has drawn 8,000
people.
   ``This debate is good,'' he said. ``I think all this means is
that the Bill of Rights is very healthy.''

   The Bush administration is urging dismissal of
a lawsuit by 45 House Democrats who say the president must get
congressional approval before launching any U.S. attack on Iraqi
forces.
   The Justice Department said Monday night the courts should not
decide the case because there is no imminent threat of hostilities
and, in any case, the issue is political and cannot be decided on
legal principles.
   The ``ultimate check'' on presidential power to deploy military
force is congressional control of the federal purse strings and not
the courts, the department said in legal papers filed with U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene.
   Those filing suit must show that they have suffered some injury
as a result of illegal conduct, the department said.
   The congressmen ``have not alleged that such an attack is
imminent, or even probable, but merely that there is a `realistic
threat' of one,'' the department said. ``The fact that a threat may
be `realistic,' however, does not mean that it is likely to be
carried out.''
   The suit seeks a preliminary injunction restraining President
Bush from launching an offensive against Iraqi troops without
congressional approval.
   Granting such relief ``would involve the court in the kind of
diplomatic and military judgments'' which are the province of
Congress and the executive branch, the Justice Department said.
   ``The courts have traditionally remained aloof from such
issues,'' it added. It urged the judge to ``refrain from
intervening in this ongoing political process'' and to dismiss the
case.
   The papers filed by assistant attorney general Stuart Gerson
called it premature to bring such a lawsuit because it is based on
the premise of hypothetical future events.
   The department also noted that Bush ``has never said that he
will not seek Congressional authorization prior to the use of
force'' against Iraqi troops, who invaded Kuwait in August.
   ``In the absence of some actual clash'' between Congress and the
executive branch, considering the lawsuit would only interject the
court unnecessarily into a political process, it added.
   The Constitution states that ``Congress shall have power ... to
declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules
concerning captures on land and water.''
   Bush and others in the administration have said they have would
consult with Congress before using offensive force against Iraq.
   Secretary of State James Baker has expressed reservations about
the notion that Bush would need congressional approval if the use
of force went beyond the defense of Saudi Arabia.
   Earlier Monday, 11 law professors supported the lawsuit in a
brief filed with the court.
   The Constitution requires that ``the President meaningfully
consult with Congress and receive its affirmative authorization -
not merely present it with faits accomplis - before engaging in
war,'' the professors said.
   Among them was Erwin Griswold, who was U.S. solicitor general
during the Johnson and Nixon administrations.
   Congressional approval must come through ``formal action, not
legislative silence, stray remarks of individual members or ...
activity that the president or a court might construe to constitute
`acquiescence,''' they said.

   The iron-fisted matriarch of a family empire
of sludge barges and tugboats was given five years' probation and
sent into retirement for fouling New York Harbor.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Iuliani said Monday only Evelyn
Berman Frank's age and ill health kept him from sentencing the
75-year-old ``Dragon Lady'' of the harbor to up to 10 years behind
bars. Mrs. Frank has skin cancer, high blood pressure and other
medical problems.
   The judge also ordered Mrs. Frank to perform 2,500 hours of
community service and cut all ties to her business.
   Her family's General Marine Transport Inc. presented a check at
Monday's hearing for $500,000, half the fine levied on the company
under a plea bargain.
   For more than 40 years Mrs. Frank had controlled a marine empire
of more than 45 interlocking companies operating tank cleaners,
barges and tugboats.
   She gained a reputation on the waterfront for barking out orders
to her barge and boat employees over shortwave radio from her Fifth
Avenue apartment in Manhattan or the basement of her Staten Island
home.
   Competitors and employees dubbed her the ``Dragon Lady.'' Mrs.
Frank in turn christened one of her tugboats The Dragon Lady.
   In July, she pleaded guilty to unlawful abandonment and release
of sewage sludge - some of it toxic - in New York Harbor in 1987
and 1988.
   The family's environmental violations date to at least 1970 but
drew little attention until September, when an illegally operated
barge dumped waste oil into the harbor. In October, New York state
closed the family's barge business.
   Lawsuits have been filed against the family and its businesses
in New York and New Jersey, the city and state of New York are
trying to collect more than $1 million in back taxes, and one
family company has filed for bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
   A former school administrator who had
maintained he was being framed for an 11-year-old slaying led
authorities to the body of his ex-girlfriend, confessed to the
crime and drew five years in prison.
   Francis W. Malinosky, 45, was sentenced Monday under a plea
bargain approved by District Judge Frank Mahady. He will be
eligible for parole in a little more than three years.
   ``I am ashamed of myself right down to the very center of my
being,'' Malinosky told the judge in confessing to the crime.
   Last week the former assistant director of special education for
Burlington schools led authorities to the body of Judith
Leo-Coneys.
   ``I loved Judy and (her son) Shamus and I thought we were going
to be a family,'' Malinosky said. The boy, 3 when his mother died,
has been raised by her parents.
   After his arrest in April, Malinosky said he was the victim of a
small-town witch hunt and vowed to prove his innocence. Authorities
said Malinosky killed the 32-year-old special education teacher in
1979 after she broke off their 2-year-old relationship.
   ``I'm still angry that someone can kill somebody with two
bullets in the back of the head and throw her body in a plastic bag
... and only get three years,'' said Leo-Coney's mother, Patricia
Leo. ``It's just not right.''
   The judge and State's Attorney William Sorrell agreed the
punishment was not strict enough. But they said Malinosky was
allowed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter because a murder
case against him could have been lost.
   Although Malinosky had long been a suspect, authorities could
not find Leo-Coney's body until he led them to her shallow grave
off a mountain road last week.
   She had vanished after going to Malinosky's home to pick up her
belongings. Malinosky disappeared a short time later, and wasn't
found until April, when he was arrested at a Los Angeles motel.
   Police tracked him down after Sorrell reopened the case last
year.
   ``I was convinced when I looked at the file that he had murdered
her,'' Sorrell said. ``It bothered me that this guy was getting
away with murder.''

   The dollar moved higher against the yen in Tokyo
Tuesday, while share prices fell moderately.
   The dollar finished at 128.95 yen, up 1.00 yen from Monday's
close of 127.95 yen. After opening at 129.10 yen, the currency
ranged between 128.55 yen and 129.10 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 139.35, or
0.59 percent, closing at 23,623.51. The index had gained 362.58
points Monday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 86.31, down from Monday's
close of 86.56. Their yield rose to 7.420 percent from 7.365
percent.
   Currency traders said the dollar started higher, nearly matching
levels set in New York, because of continuing tensions in the
Persian Gulf. The dollar closed at 129.05 yen in New York.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of international tension
because it is seen as a safe investment, while reports of a
possible gulf war usually weaken the yen because Japan depends on
the Middle East for about 70 percent of its oil supply.
   The dollar later moved to lose some of its early gains, with
bearish sentiment toward the currency prevailing in the market,
traders said.
   ``The dollar was edging lower as it faced selling pressure above
the 129 yen,'' said Shoken Sakamoto, an exchange dealer with New
Japan Securities Co.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index fell back on small-lot
selling in trading discouraged by weakening yen and bond prices as
well as higher oil prices, securities dealers said.

   U.S. concern over the Persian Gulf crisis has
produced the highest-level meeting between the United States and
Cuba since the two countries opened diplomatic offices in each
other's capitals 13 years ago.
   Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmitt, the third-ranking
official at the State Department, met Sunday with the chief of
Cuba's diplomatic mission here, Jose Arbesu.
   Previously, the most senior U.S. official to meet with Cuba's
chief diplomat here has been the assistant secretary for Latin
American affairs.
   A spokesman at the Cuban mission said Monday that the Sunday
meeting was limited to a discussion of the consultations on the
gulf at the U.N. Security Council, of which Cuba occupies one of
the 10 non-permanent seats.

<HEAD>Cavazos: College Is Still Affordable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is calling
on colleges and universities to make ``tough choices'' to cut
costs.
   Cavazos insisted Monday that colleges still are affordable,
although tuition increases during the 1980s averaged about 8
percent a year. Average tuition and fees for fall 1990 ranged from
$884 at two-year public colleges to $9,391 at four-year private
colleges.
   Escalating costs of higher education have some analysts
predicting that ``four years of college early in the next century
may cost several hundred thousand dollars,'' said Cavazos.
   Cavazos stressed that the predictions are based on
``misperceptions about both the true cost of college and the
availability of student financial aid.'' Yet he released a
handbook, entitled ``Tough Choices,'' to help colleges examine
institutional goals and priorities and make decisions to control
spending.
   ``If we are to keep higher education affordable, colleges and
universities are going to have to make serious efforts to control
costs,'' he told reporters. ``Each institution must identify its
central mission and focus, and then allocate resources accordingly,
with the understanding that no single institution can do everything
well.''
   For example, Cavazos said colleges should consider merging
duplicative services or programs and possibly eliminating programs,
including certain athletic or sports programs. Institutions also
might consider coordinating services with nearby schools, he said.

<HEAD>American University President Wants to Remain on Faculty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former American University prssident Richard
Berendzen, who resigned after being charged with making obscene
telephone calls, says he wants to remain on the faculty.
   Berendzen said Monday the controversy over a reported $1 million
buyout of his contract as president and as a tenured professor of
physics has caused him ``great anguish.''
   ``I am seeing the fabric of this family torn by rumor and
innuendo,'' Berendzen said in a statement issued through his
attorney. ``I have initiated steps that I hope will bring harmony
to the university I love so dearly.''
   He pleaded guilty in May to two charges of making obscene phone
calls in Fairfax County, Va., and received two 30-day jail
sentences, which were suspended on the condition that he remain in
psychiatric treatment.
   Berendzen said he was hopeful the board of trustees will approve
his return to teaching ``after an appropriate period of leave.''
   Last week, acting president Milton Greenberg asked the trustees
to rescind the buyout offer. He cited ``serious rifts'' which the
arrangement had caused between the trustees and the rest of the
university.

   Did Thomas Jefferson father a child by one of
his slaves? Did Old Hickory's wife already have an old man? And,
say, what COULD you see by the dawn's early light?
   Historians - professional know-it-alls who usually save
questions for students - admit to a few intriguing doubts of their
own in the December issue of American Heritage.
   The magazine asked American historians to name the one mystery
in U.S. history each would like solved. Responses ranged from
``Were Sacco and Vanzetti guilty?'' to ``Who invented the
hamburger?''
   Walter Lord wonders what Francis Scott Key saw the morning he
wrote ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' during the War of 1812.
   Key was forced to observe the British bombardment of Fort
McHenry in Baltimore Harbor from a flag-of-truce boat eight miles
away. He later said he composed the song's lyrics at dawn, when the
sight of the flag assured him the attack had been repelled.
   But that was unlikely, Lord suggests. Although the fort's
regular flag might have been visible from eight miles, the night's
rain would have forced the use of a lighter, smaller ``storm flag''
that probably could not have been seen through smoke and rain in
early light.
   Lord argues that it's more likely Key saw an ensign flag raised
by the victorious Americans over the fort's guns - a flag that a
British officer saw raised around 9 a.m., not dawn.
   Key however, ``knew that dawn is a more magic hour than 9
a.m.,'' Lord writes. ``It was time to resort to a little poetic
license.''
   Another historian, Charles O'Neill, wonders if the space shuttle
Challenger was sent aloft despite less than optimal temperatures
because the White House wanted a dramatic background for President
Reagan's 1986 State of the Union address, originally scheduled for
the night of the launch.
   He writes:
   ``By examination of White House logs or otherwise, I'd like it
clearly proven or disproven whether word ... went to (NASA
officials), bidding those in charge not to be too finicky - given
the upcoming address - about getting the Challenger into the air,
cold weather or no cold weather.''
   Columbia University historian Henry Graff wonders why former
President James Monroe repeatedly sued the government for expenses
after leaving office. He suspects Monroe was ashamed of ``the
substantial charges ... that he misapplied public money while in
official posts (even that he had personally profited from his
refurbishing of the White House after its torching by the
British).''
   Several historians - uncomfortable, perhaps, with the mantle of
ignorance - suggest solutions to their own mysteries.
   Thomas Fleming believes that Jefferson did not father the
mulatto boy who looked like him. The slave woman, Sally Hemmings,
was the illegitimate daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law, and her
children probably were fathered by Jefferson's nephew, he says.
Fleming suspects Jefferson never denied the charge publicly to
protect his family.
   Despite denials by Andrew Jackson's supporters, biographer
Robert Remini says it appears Jackson and his wife, Rachel, married
sometime between October 1790 and January 1791 - about three years
before a court dissolved Rachel's first marriage and the couple
``officially'' married.
   Some questions lack even a suggested answer.
   What happened to Sen. Huey Long's ``de-duct'' box, which was
filled with a million dollars in campaign contributions and
disappeared after his assassination in 1935? - Ken Burns, producer
of PBS documentary ``The Civil War.''
   Why did Secretary of War Edwin Stanton refuse President Lincoln
the military escort he'd requested on the day he was assassinated?
And why did he dissuade Gen. Ulysses Grant from joining Lincoln at
Ford's Theater that night? - Jacques Barzun, Columbia University.
   Why did the federal government give Virginia the portion of the
District of Columbia south of the Potomac River, making the
capital's boundary look like ``a sandwich with a large corner
bitten off?'' - The late Marcus Cunliffe, George Washington
University.
   And then there's the hamburger. Twenty years ago, when J.C.
Furnas tried to determine its inventor, he settled on a creation
scenario, circa 1905: a late-night run on bread for a broiled beef
patty sandwich forces a restaurant cook to substitute the rolls
then used for ham sandwiches; customers praise the innovation for
its ease in handling.
   But where, Furnas asks, was that all-night lunchroom, and who
was that cook?

   Iraq has transferred more than 100
Westerners, including at least five Americans, from strategic sites
in Kuwait to Baghdad, diplomats report.
   The U.S. and British diplomats say the hostages were brought to
the Mansour Melia Hotel in the Iraqi capital. It wasn't clear if
they would be released.
   President Saddam Hussein appeared on television with hostages
and their families on Monday and said three Americans would be
allowed to go home.
   The Swedish Embassy said more than 50 Swedes in Iraq also have
been given permission to leave. And the wife of a Canadian hostage
said he told her as many as 25 Canadians were about to be released.
   ``I talked to my husband by phone (Monday) and he said the word
was that 15 to 25 of the Canadians were going to be let out,'' Lois
Minns said in Edmonton, Alberta. Ralph Minns has been confined to
his Baghdad hotel for the last three weeks, she said.
   In Moscow on Monday, Soviet officials charged that Iraq was
dragging its feet on the departure of Soviets from Iraq, failing to
allow people to leave as promised. It was the first time Moscow had
accused Baghdad of preventing Soviet citizens from leaving Iraq.
   At least 4,000 of an estimated 8,000 Soviets who were in Iraq
when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 have left.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Iraq agreed to
clear another 1,000 to leavein November, but only 350 have been
allowed to go.
   ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our
citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even
further and force us to take a tougher attitude,'' he said.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, met with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin on Monday and indicated a
``bureaucratic accident'' had resulted in the delay of the
departure of the Soviets, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   A broadcast on Iraqi television Monday included footage of
Saddam meeting with a group of Americans and their relatives, who
were told they would be allowed to leave together.
   ``If you feel that hospitality has come to an end, you can
travel to the United States of America, or anywhere else in the
world at any time you deem appropriate,'' the report quoted Saddam
as saying.
   The hostages shown on TV were Fred Harrington, 59, of Bellevue,
Wash., John Stevenson, 44, of Panama City, Fla.
   The daughter-in-law of hostage Clyde Jesse, 55, a suburban
Chicago businessman who was living in Kuwait, said Jesse has also
been promised he can leave Iraq.
   The U.S. Embassy has said there are more than 900 Americans in
Kuwait and Iraq, including 104 held at strategic sites.
   Saddam has been freeing small numbers of hostages almost daily
in response to pleas from visiting dignitaries.
   U.S. officials say the releases are a ploy to win sympathy and
divide the global coalition opposed to his occupation of Kuwait.
   Tony Benn, leader of a left-wing faction of the British Labor
Party, arrived in Baghdad on Monday and said he would try to free
British hostages.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners beginning Dec. 25 in
exchange for U.S. guarantees he will not be attacked.
   The release period from Dec. 25 to March 25 coincides with the
time considered best to launch a military operation since
temperatures are lower and there are frequent stretches of calm
weather.

share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 128.95 yen, up 1.00 yen from Monday's close

   Currency traders said Persion Gulf tensions helped keep the

   ``The yen was sold because of rising oil prices,'' said a dealer

   The U.S. currency is regarded a safe haven in times of
international tensions. Worries about a possible war in the gulf
also usually weaken the yen because Japan imports about 70 percent
of its oil from the Middle East.
   Brent crude for January delivery was notionally valued at about
$33.40 to $33.50 a barrel, about 50 cents above levels seen late
Monday in New York.
   Reports that the U.N. Security Council was likely to approve a
resolution authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait
depressed the Tokyo stock market, analysts said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
362.58 points Monday, lost 139.35, or 0.59 percent, closing at
23,623.51.
   A total of 250 million shares were traded on the first section,
unchanged from Monday's trading volume.
   ``There was no direction in the market, with many investors
taking a wait-and-see position,'' said Takashi Morinaga, an analyst
with Okasan Securities.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slid to 86.45 from Monday's close of
86.56. Their yield rose to 7.390 percent from 7.365 percent.

   Voters who have over the past year cast
ballots in Eastern Europe's first free elections in decades were
sometimes able to get the results from the evening news, thanks to
a German polling firm.
   The Bonn-based Infas polling institute has made one of the first
major injections of technical skill into Eastern Europe in the form
of exit polls.
   The institute, founded in 1958, has done exit polling in
elections in former East Germany, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria
and Poland.
   In Poland on Sunday, Infas was within a few percentage points of
the final result just hours after the polls closed.
   It is yet another indication of the might a united Germany will
have in Eastern Europe, as countries lacking in many of the basic
skills of democracy turn to their nearest and most powerful
democratic neighbor.
   Germany is the chief provider of aid to Eastern Europe, and
major German companies have through years of cultivating contacts
established themselves firmly in the countries of the former Soviet
bloc.
   Freed by Eastern Europe's reforms and prompted by their
fledgling media's attempt to cope, the Eastern European polling
ventures mark the first time Infas has conducted election polls
outside Germany, officials said.
   Initial exit polls from Infas, which was hired by Poland's state
television, projected that Lech Walesa would take 41 percent of the
vote, with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and emigre Stanislaw
Tyminski tied at 20.5 percent.
   Further Infas results released around midnight from the 404
districts it targeted gave Walesa 39.3 percent, Tyminski 23.2
percent and Mazowiecki 19.9 percent.
   Based on complete, but unofficial, returns released by the
Polish news agency PAP on Monday, Walesa won 39.96 percent of the
vote, Tyminski 23.10 percent and Mazowiecki 18.08 percent.
   ``These first projected results are sometimes 2 or 3 percentage
points away from the final result, but the second projected result
is much closer,'' Reinhart Schneider, one of the project leaders in
Infas' election department, said in an interview Monday.
   Infas has been ``very accurate'' in its forecasts, Schneider
said. He was especially proud of results from Romania, the most
difficult of the institute's foreign ventures.
   ``Romania was really a unique situation. It was a revolutionary
situation, still,'' he said.
   But, he added, ``you can see how close the methods come.''
   In the May 20 presidential elections, Ion Iliescu of the
National Salvation Front received 85.1 percent of the vote, and
Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party got 10.2 percent,
according to final results.
   Exit poll projections gave 83 percent of the vote to Iliescu and
11 percent to Campeanu, Schneider said.
   Infas has been approached and paid by the media in the country
holding each of the elections, Schneider said. In each case, it
hooked up with a partner institute that translated the institute's
questions and provided native speakers to do the interviewing.
   ``This is not very difficult, but you have to have the
experience to do this,'' Schneider said. ``These Eastern countries
have not yet the experience in doing these things because they have
not had democratic elections for years, for decades.''

   Industry analysts say MCA Inc. - the
entertainment giant that gave the world ``E.T.'' and ``Jaws'' - is
so well run that its new Japanese owners will allow creative
control to remain in American hands.
   In the biggest Japanese purchase ever of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. struck a $6.6 billion deal for
MCA on Monday.
   The Japanese maker of videocasette recorders, televisions and
stereos under such brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar
got a company that produces hit TV shows such as ``Murder, She
Wrote'' and ``Major Dad,'' records artists such as Elton John and
Guns N' Roses and owns many of the biggest movies of all time.
   MCA became the fourth major Hollywood studio to come under
foreign control, raising fears that responsiblity for the financing
and political content of American entertainment is falling
increasingly into non-American hands.
   In a statement Monday, Matsushita indicated its awareness of
American fears of Japanese investment and sought to allay them by
promising to leave MCA's management intact and allow the company's
direction to be determined at home.
   Analysts and MCA executives said the public is unlikely to see
much of a difference in movie theaters, from CD players or on TV
screens.
   ``They bought it precisely because of management,'' said Jeff
Logsdon of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. ``It doesn't help them to
interfere in the creative process.''
   ``I don't think Matsushita made a major investment in a company
that's doing very well to try to change what it's doing,'' said
MCA's movie chief, Tom Pollock.
   Still, the deal has brought skepticism and criticism.
   Record producer Quincy Jones said he was worried that the
country was selling off its heritage.
   In Japan, the nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper
reported that Matsushita pushed to close the deal before Dec. 7,
the 49th anniversary of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, to
avoid public relations problems.
   Concerns were expressed in Japanese newspapers of an
anti-Japanese backlash in the United States. Backlashes followed
Japanese purchases of Columbia Pictures, Rockefeller Plaza in New
York and Pebble Beach in California.
   Skepticism arose at a news conference in Japan on Monday when
Matsushita President Akio Tanii was asked if he would object to MCA
making a ``Japan-bashing'' film or one critical of Emperor
Hirohito's role in World War II.
   ``Something like that shouldn't emerge,'' said Tanii, looking
agitated. ``Filmmakers must create films that are inspirational,
that will be enjoyable for everybody. I can't even imagine a case
like that.''
   To silence criticism that arose during negotiations, Matsushita
said it will sell MCA's Curry Co. subsidiary, which operates
restaurants, hotels and other services in Yosemite National Park.
   Matsushita will also spin off MCA's WWOR-TV in the New York area
into a separate company owned by MCA shareholders. Foreign
companies are not allowed to own domestic TV stations.
   Japan's Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment last
year, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti bought MGM-UA
Communications last month and Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based News
Corp. has owned 20th Century Fox since 1985.
   Like the $5 billion Sony-Columbia deal, the MCA-Matsushita
merger blends Hollywood ``software'' - movies, TV shows and
recordings - with Japanese hardware in an effort to exploit the
huge world demand for both types of product.
   MCA, which began 65 years ago as a booking agent for jazz bands,
has grown to become a colossus of films (Universal Pictures' ``E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Jaws'' and ``Back to the Future''),
records (Reba McEntire, Bobby Brown, George Strait) and television.
Attendance at its Universal Studios theme parks in Florida and
California is exceeded only by Disney's.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen percent of Vietnam's nearly 65
million people - about 8.5 million - are disabled as a result of
war, accidents or congenital deformities, the official Vietnam News
Agency said today.
   The official figure was reported at a seminar on rehabilitation
held in Hanoi on Monday by the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and
Social Affairs, the agency said in its report, monitored in
Bangkok.
   Rehabilitation is part of the health care programs of 35 of 40
provinces and cities in Vietnam, it said.
   The Vietnamese have fought five wars in the past five decades.
   Vietnam began withdrawing its troops from Cambodia last year,
but guerrillas opposing the pro-Vietnamese Phnom Penh government
say thousands of Vietnamese soldiers remain.
   The problems of the disabled are aggravated by the poor health
conditions and the scarcity of basic medical care in Vietnam, one
of the world's poorest nations.

<TEXT>
   A young man on trial in the Central Park jogger
case testified police bullied him into signing a false confession.
Later, he jumped from the stand during cross-examination, saying,
``I'm not taking anymore.''
   Kharey Wise, 18, said on Monday that police hit him, coached him
and deceived him to make him confess to the 1989 attack.
   Defense attorney Colin Moore showed Wise a statement he signed
while in police custody. In the statement, Wise implicates himself
in the attack on a runner who was gang raped and beaten almost to
death.
   Wise testified Detective John Hartigan told him to lie.
   ``Tell him that you were there,'' the defendant quoted Hartigan
as saying. ``Put yourself in it.''
   ``I said, `If I tell him a lie, can I go home?' He promised me I
could.''
   The defendant refused to answer certain questions by Assistant
District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer and balked at her insistent
questioning about his truancy in 1985.
   ``What does this have to do with my case?'' Wise shouted. ``Come
on, man!''
   He jumped from the witness chair but after repeated warnings
from the judge was persuaded to return. The jury was led out of the
courtroom when Wise vehemently refused to answer other questions
about truancy in 1989.
   Wise, who was 16 when the attack occurred, and Kevin Richardson,
16, are the second set of teen-agers to be tried on charges of rape
and attempted murder in the attack.
   Three others were convicted Aug. 18. All were sentenced to five
to 10 years in prison. Another youth will be tried early next year.
   The 30-year-old jogger recovered from most of her injuries and
has returned to work as an investment banker. She said she still
suffers vision and balance problems and lost her sense of smell.

<TEXT>
   Janet Jackson took home eight prizes at the
Billboard Music Awards on the strength of her 1989 smash album,
``Rhythm Nation: 1814.''
   The 24-year-old sister of Michael Jackson was named the year's
No. 1 rhythm and blues artist, R&amp;B albums artist, R&amp;B singles
artist and Hot 100 singles artist.
   ``Rhythm Nation'' was chosen best pop album and best R&amp;B album
Monday night. The singer was also named top dance artist and top
dance singles artist.
   The awards are given by Billboard magazine and are based on the
artists' record sales.
   Other winners included M.C. Hammer, for top pop and rap artist,
and Sinead O'Connor, for the top-ranking worldwide hit single
``Nothing Compares 2 U.''
   Phil Collins won three awards: top adult contemporary artist,
adult contemporary single for the song ``Do You Remember'' and
worldwide album for ``... But Seriously.''
   Miss Jackson, who composed or helped compose seven of the 12
songs on ``Rhythm Nation'' and co-produced the record, said her
goal was to ``mix social consciousness with dance music'' and
``affect people in a positive way.''
   ``The most rewarding thing for me was to actually meet kids who
had dropped out of school, had been hooked on drugs, or had even
tried to take their own lives, but were inspired to change through
`Rhythm Nation,''' she said.
   The date in the album title refers to the year Francis Scott Key
wrote the national anthem. Miss Jackson said she believed her song
``Rhythm Nation'' could be ``the national anthem for the '90s.''

<HEAD>Brazilian State Elections Seen as Setback for President

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello
suffered a sweeping defeat in gubernatorial runoff elections whose
results were widely considered a rejection of his tough
anti-inflation policies.
   The runoffs were held Sunday in 15 of the country's 26 states
where none of the candidates obtained an absolute majority in the
first round.
   Collor's allies lost the runoffs in each of five major states
contested Sunday: Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais,
Parana and Espirito Santo, according to results that came in
Monday.
   Results in the other six, more isolated states were expected to
trickle in.
   ``The overall picture is terrible for the president,'' said
presidential chief of staff Marcos Coimbra.
   The results seemed to show a sudden plunge in Collor's political
fortunes. His allies had swept to victory in 10 of 11 state
governors' races that were determined in the first round of voting,
on Oct. 3.
   Political analysts said the election of opposition governors in
the major states would make it difficult for Collor to obtain
congressional support for his economic programs, which have frozen
wages despite continued severe inflation.
   Brazil's governors are powerful. Under a 1988 constitution,
states get a guaranteed share of federal tax receipts, and
governors have a large measure of influence over their states'
congressional delegations.
   One key state, Rio de Janeiro, was won in the first round by
populist Leonel Brizola, a strong critic of Collor.
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous state, Luiz
Antonio Fleury Filho of the moderate Brazilian Democratic Movement
Party defeated Paulo Salim Maluf of the conservative Social
Democratic Party in the runoff vote.
   Maluf, a wealthy businessman and former governor, was discreetly
backed by Collor.
   In the important southern farming state of Rio Grande do Sul,
victor Alceu de Deus Collares of the leftist Democratic Labor Party
said the government should interpret the results ``as a warning of
the people's opposition to economic policies that provoke
recession, unemployment and bankruptcies.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Augusto Pinochet still
is the army commander, but has been losing political ground to
Patricio Aylwin, the elected civilian who succeeded him.
   Even right-wing politicians who supported the 75-year-old
general during his 16{ years of military rule, which ended in
March, are saying he should stay out of politics.
   The annual revision of the armed forces high command this month
gave Aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his
political authority.
   For the first time since the political coup that brought him to
power in 1973, the makeup of the high command was not determined by
Pinochet alone.
   Aylwin vetoed the promotions of two generals. Pinochet
challenged his right to do so but Aylwin was upheld by the General
Comptroller's office, which rules on the legality of government
decisions.
   Pinochet retained command of the army after leaving the
presidency, under a clause in the 1980 constitution the military
regime wrote, and Aylwin cannot fire him.
   Before the transfer of power, aides to Aylwin predicted the
general would retain great political authority and threaten Chile's
newly restored democratic rule. That has not happened.
   Most observers acknowledge Pinochet's power has faded, for
several reasons: a financial scandal involving army officers,
Aylwin's skillful handling of relations with the military and the
disciplined, non-political attitude of the other service
commanders.
   In occasional comments to reporters, Pinochet insists he now is
``totally out of politics,'' but some of his public actions suggest
otherwise.
   Last May, he publicly criticized Aylwin's establishment of a
commission to investigate human rights abuses under the military
regime.
   In response, Aylwin summoned the general to the presidential
palace and rejected the ``political connotations'' of his remarks.
   Later, Pinochet caused an international incident by saying the
German army was made up in part of ``marijuana smokers, drug
addicts, longhairs, hommosexuals and unionists.''
   After Aylwin condemned the comments, Pinochet withdrew them and
apologized.
   On Sept. 11, the 17th anniversary of the coup, Pinochet caused a
political uproar by saying he would do it again under the same
circumstances.
   Even some old supporters are putting distance between themselves
and the general, saying he has has no legitimate political role.
   ``Gen. Pinochet is no longer a political option in Chile,'' said
Sebastian Pinera, a leading right-wing senator.
   Another senator, who was an ambassador under Pinochet, sided
with Aylwin in the dispute over the high command. Pro-goverment
politicians who once feared the continued presence of Pinochet as
army commander now say they may have been wrong.
   ``Pinochet is not yet checkmated, but he is nearing the end of
his match,'' said Camilio Escalona, a Socialist congressman.
   Loyalty to Pinochet and support for him are believed to be firm
in the army, but only in his military capacity.
   Aylwin told an interviewer on state television he does not think
he will have trouble with the army, and said of Pinochet:
   ``I understand that he who ruled the country as an absolute
master for nearly 17 years now has trouble accommodating to his new
role, subordinated to the president of the republic and to the
minister of defense.''
   The conflict with Aylwin on the high command caught Pinochet in
a weakened position. A congressional commission is investigating an
army payment to one of his sons of the equivalent of $3 million,
apparently for the purchase of a metallurgy plant.
   Newspapers have reported in recent weeks on an illegal savings
and loan organization in which several army officers participated.
   Many Chileans expect a decisive moment in relations between
Pinochet and the civilian government in February, when the
commission investigating human rights abuses issues its final
report.
   Trials are expected to result, many of them involving military
officers.
   Before leaving office, Pinochet said repeatedly he would not
accept trials of military men on human rights issues.

<HEAD>State Abandons Plan To Evict 73-Year-Old Squatter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State officials who fought for three
decades to throw a woman off a strip of beachfront property slated
to become a state park have decided she doesn't have to leave after
all.
   Doris Gagnon was to be evicted Friday from her rundown
collection of shacks and trailers overlooking Long Island Sound.
But state Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle announced Monday
that officials have decided to let the 73-year-old cancer-stricken
woman stay.
   Riddle said the decision was made after officials learned that
bags of human waste had been removed from the property and other
sanitation violations cleaned up. She also said officials don't
need the land right away.
   But Gagnon said health conditions at her home are no better than
before, and she accused state officials of letting her stay in the
hope that their battle with her will end when she dies.
   ``I won't give them the satisfaction of dying,'' she added.
   Gagnon, who originally owned a house on the property, refused to
sell it to the state in the 1960s. The government seized it through
eminent domain proceedings and awarded her $15,000 that she refused

<HEAD>Homeless Advocates Decry Subway Begging Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the homeless denounced a Supreme
Court decision to keep intact a ban on subway begging.
   ``What this decision does is gives police the authority to
arbitrarily harass homeless and poor people,'' said Doug Lasdon, an
attorney from the Legal Action Center for the Homeless.
   Without comment, the Supreme Court Monday declined to review the
case Lasdon's group had asked it to hear. The group argued the ban
infringes on free-speech rights.
   Transit officials praised the high court's refusal to review the
ban, saying it will help restore order underground.
   ``Nobody likes to push around poor people,'' said Jared Lebow, a
spokesman for the Transit Authority, which runs the nation's
largest subway system with 3.5 million daily riders. ``But we also
recognize that our obligation is to people who use the system to
get to and from work.''
   The ban was imposed in October 1989. The objective was to crack
down on vagrancy in subways, where many of the city's estimated
80,000 homeless people go to stay warm, sleep and beg for small
change.
   No fine is imposed. Beggars are merely removed or directed to a
service agency for help.

<HEAD>Police Say No Evidence of Violent Conspiracy in Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say they have no evidence that either New
York Daily News management or its unions have conspired to commit
violent acts during the monthlong strike against the newspaper.
   Daily News Publisher James Hoge told a joint state Senate and
Assembly labor panel hearing in New York City on Monday that the
newspaper's nine striking unions are responsible for a series of
violent incidents.
   ``Clearly, violence and intimidation are longstanding and
premeditated tools of these unions to lawlessly enforce their
will,'' he said.
   Union officials accused Daily News management of precipitating
attacks on strikers.
   But police officials testified there was no evidence to support
the allegations of either side.
   ``We haven't been able at this point to put together some type
of conspiracy,'' said Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli. ``We
don't see a conspiracy at all here as of now.''
   Chief of Department Robert Johnston said 107 people had been
arrested in connection with the strike as of Friday, 75 of whom
were union members. Seventeen were non-strikers and 15 were people
whose involvement was not immediately clear, he said.
   Meanwhile, Daily News officials reported the newspaper expects
to lose $30 million to $35 million during the last quarter of 190,
bringing its losses for the year to $80 million to $90 million.
   The Daily News lost $115 million between 1979 and 1989, said
John T. Sloan, the newspaper's vice president for human resources.
   The newspaper's financial problems continued Monday when another
big company decided to pull its advertising. Sloan said Alexander's
department store joined Macy's and A &amp; S department stores in
dropping its ads.
   The Daily News has managed to publish continuously since the
strike began Oct. 25, but Sloan said its circulation has fallen
from 1.09 million before the strike to 508,000 as of Nov. 16.

   Following is a list of recent incidents
involving Israeli forces in Lebanon:
   Oct. 21 - Israeli soldiers and allied Lebanese militiamen
pursued and attacked a Lebanese guerrilla squad spotted inside
Israel's buffer zone in south Lebanon. The militiamen caught up
with them outside the zone and killed four of them, the army said.
   Oct. 24 - Israeli jets bombed a guerrilla position near
Rachadiya in south Lebanon from which Katyusha rockets were fired
into Israel and the buffer zone, the army said. On the same day, it
said, Israeli troops swept north of the buffer zone and killed two
guerrillas in a raid on a base of the Lebanese Shiite Moslem
militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, at the village of Hunah, 15
miles north of the border.
   Nov. 9 - Israeli tanks, paratroopers and infantry attacked three
Hezbollah bases west of Jezzine. The raid came a day after Israel
said it would protect the Christians of Jezzine, which is outside
the Israeli-controlled zone. No casualties were reported.
   Nov. 20 - An Israeli officer and four Palestinians were killed
when a patrol ambushed a guerrilla squad near Ain Atta, north of
the buffer zone in Lebanon. Police in Lebanon said the squad was
from the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, a Libyan-backed PLO
faction.
   Nov. 24 - An Israeli navy vessel killed five armed guerrillas in
a dinghy off the Lebanese coast as they headed to a raid on Israel,
the army said. A Syrian-backed PLO faction, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, said it sent the
dinghy.
   Nov. 25 - A Lebanese woman strapped with explosives blew herself
up as she approached an Israeli army patrol near the Beaufort
Crusader castle in south Lebanon, the army said. It said two
Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded. A Lebanese faction, the
Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, said the woman was one of its
members.
   Nov. 27 - Five Israeli soldiers and at least two Palestinian
guerrillas were killed in a clash near Shebaa, on the edge of the
eastern sector of the buffer zone, the army said. It said the
guerrilas belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a PLO faction led by George Habash.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said today that an emigre's
strong presidential bid was a ``cold shower'' for Solidarity and
appealed to former rivals for help to defeat what he called this
dangerous ``third force.''
   The outsider, businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, shocked reporters
at a news conference by praising Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's 1981
decision to impose martial law to crush Solidarity. He said the
country then was under ``unusual danger'' from within.
   Meanwhile, main national newspapers mourned the fall of the East
bloc's first non-Communist government after it resigned Monday
night. Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government was a ``good
and right'' cause, one said.
   Walesa, who will face Tyminski in a runoff Dec. 9, met the press
in a packed conference room in Gdansk and extended an olive branch
to supporters of Mazowiecki, his vanquished rival within
Solidarity.
   ``We are doomed to be together. ... We should pull this common
Polish wagon together,'' Walesa said.
   ``We have to complete the Polish reforms. This is what the prime
minister was (only) saying, and I am trying to actually carry
out.''
   Walesa polled 40 percent of the electorate in Poland's first
democratic presidential elections Sunday. Tyminski got 23 percent
and Mazowiecki 18.
   Walesa said he had warned that Solidarity was losing support
from the masses.
   ``Those people who were with Mazowiecki, who really worked so
hard, did not want to understand,'' he said. ``This cold shower
will wake us all up and we will think seriously about reforms in
Poland.''
   Now, he said, ``A third force is possible and capable of
overthrowing us all.''
   Lame duck President Jaruzelski formally asked Mazowiecki to
carry on a caretaker government until the next president names a
prime minister, and Mazowiecki agreed to stay on. Walesa told
reporters he would like ``the smallest changes possible'' in
personnel until parliamentary elections in the spring.
   Walesa said he would telephone Mazowiecki and appeal for ``not
multiplying the tension.''
   Tyminski, who lived 21 years in Canada and Peru running a string
of computer and communications companies, returned to his homeland
in September and launched a bid for president.
   At a packed news conference in Warsaw, he attacked sacred cows
of Polish political life, including praising Jaruzelski and damning
Mazowiecki for his economic policies and for alleged cooperation
with Communist authorities as a journalist in the early 1950s.
   Of Jaruzelski's martial-law decision, he said: ``I hope that
this country understands now how much has been done for it by
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, because at that moment (in 1981) the
country was in unusual danger ... from within, because the hand
that did the injury for so many years was always our own.''
   ``They are very irresponsible,'' he said, referring to the shock
economic reform program instituted in January to almost universal
praise from the world financial community. ``Even if nothing had
been done, there would not be destruction on such a scale.''
   A radical economic restructuring plan, backed by both Walesa and
Mazowiecki, has caused real wages in Poland to plummet 35 percent.
Unemployment climbed from almost zero at the start of 1990 to more
than 1 million today.
   Mazowiecki in his resignation statement Monday night said he had
been brought down by lack of public patience for the sacrifices
required to improve the economy.
   ``Poland's painful but necessary program of getting out of
economic catastrophe can only be realized with the understanding of
the majority of the nation,'' he said. ``Society made its choice.''
   The taciturn, lawyerly prime minister, who took office in August
1989 after decades as a writer in the Catholic opposition, won
international acclaim for his historic role in the democratization
of his nation.
   ``It happens that good and right causes lose,'' said Adam
Michnik, editor of the pro-Mazowiecki paper Gazeta Wyborcza,
Poland's largest. ``Rational argument lost out in a dispute with
aggressive rhetoric and faith in a miracle.''
   Walesa and Mazowiecki had been allies in the underground
Solidarity movement but have headed rival wings of the organization
since shortly after the prime minister took office.
   Walesa contended reforms had to be speeded up to avert social
unrest while Mazowiecki, the longtime adviser Walesa had picked to
be prime minister, stuck by an independent policy of measured,
reasoned change.
   Mazowiecki's election committee seemed to throw its support to
Walesa in a grudging way.
   In a statement, it described Tyminski's possible election as an
unallowable ``tragedy'' for Poland and said supporters should do
``whatever serves the interests of the country.''

<HEAD>Existing HomeSales Down 4.7 Percent, Realtors Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Existing home sales fell 4.7 percent in
October to their lowest level in nearly six years, a real estate
trade group said today.
   The National Association of Realtors said house resales totaled
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.02 million, compared to 3.17
million in September. It was the lowest sales rate since February
1985 when it dropped to 2.95 million.
   Reports of persistent budget deficit woes, general economic
sluggishness nationwide and the threat of war against Iraq have
created psychological barriers that are blocking home purchases,
according to Harley E. Rouda, NAR president.
   Mortgage interest rates, which had been blamed for weak sales in
previous months, have remained relatively stable, Rouda noted. He
said the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported the average rate
for a 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgage ranged between
10.08 percent and 10.17 percent during October.
   Rouda said the current rates are in marked contrast to the last
home-buying slump in 1982, when rates ranged between 16.0 percent
and 18.0 percent. And, he added, despite tight credit restrictions
for commercial development projects, mortgage funds remain
plentiful for home buyers.
   At the same time, the Realtors said the median price of an
existing home was $92,800 in October, down 1.7 percent from
September. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Rouda said the monthly decline and a ``marginal'' 0.4 percent
increase over October 1989 means that sellers are adjusting their
prices to fit a buyer's market.
   Month-to-month sales declines were recorded in each of the
regions while all but the West posted lower median prices.
   In the Northeast, the resale pace was 470,000 units, 9.6 percent
below the September rate. The median price was $136,200, down 0.7
percent from the previous month.
   Sales in the West totaled 490,000 in October, down 5.8 percent
from the previous month. The median price there was $140,600, 4.4
percent higher than in September.
   In the Midwest, sales were off 5.7 percent, to an annual rate of
820,000 units, while the median price fell 2.8 percent to $72,100.
   Sales in the South totaled 1.23 million, down 2.4 percent from
September. The median price dropped 2.9 percent, to $83,400.
   The Realtors said sales of existing homes are expected to total
3.33 million units this year, down 4.1 percent from 1989's 3.44
million total.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has issued his
sharpest warning yet to Saddam Hussein, saying Iraq will soon face
grave consequences if it doesn't withdraw from Kit and release
all hostages.
   Gorbachev summoned Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to the
Kremlin on Monday to deliver a stern message to Saddam that no one
takes seriously Baghdad's claim that Kuwait is Iraqi territory, and
that time is running out.
   Unless Iraq obeys U.N. resolutions demanding its withdrawal,
Gorbachev said it faces ``the worst'' consequences, the official
Tass news agency reported.
   Gorbachev also told Aziz that Iraq must keep its promises to
allow the departure of all Soviet contract workers who want to go
home.
   Another Soviet official on Monday accused Iraq of reneging on an
agreement to let about 1,000 Soviets leave this month. It was the
first time Moscow had charged that Baghdad was keeping Soviet
citizens against their will.
   Iraq was until recently a close ally of Moscow, and the Soviets
supplied Baghdad with a wide array of armaments.
   Gorbachev accused Saddam of failing to conform to accepted
standards of morality and of turning the release of foreigners into
a kind of bargaining, Tass reported.
   Aziz reportedly responded that the delayed evacuation of Soviets
was a ``bureaucratic accident.''
   On Monday, the United States finally won Soviet support for a
U.N. resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq.
Foreign ministers are expected to meet in New York on Thursday to
take it up.
   The Soviet Union has attemped to explore all possible diplomatic
avenues before endorsing the use of force to push Iraq from Kuwait.
   Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met
today with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. No details
were reported.
   In addition, Gorbachev is sending envoys to discuss the crisis
with Iran and Cuba.
   He dispatched Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky to
Tehran, and another foreign ministry official, Georgy Mamedov, was
to leave later today for Havana. Cuba is a member of the Security
Council.
   Gorbachev appeared before the Supreme Soviet parliament on
Monday and forcefully warned Saddam that the unity of nations
allied against Iraqi aggression cannot be broken.
   Answering questions from legislators about the possibility of
hostilities in the gulf, Gorbachev said the crisis was a test of
the new post-Cold War cooperation.
   ``Our position remains based on principles and it includes the
following: Aggression is inadmissible. It should be punished, and
the pre-aggression state should be restored,'' Gorbachev said in a
booming voice.
   He said Saddam's aggression could not be allowed to prevail
``because we are just moving away from the Cold War, when
everything was decided from a position of force.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Iraq had agreed
to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract workers, to leave during
November, but only about 350 were permitted to do so.
   About 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred military
advisers, were in Iraq and Kuwait at the time of the Aug. 2
invasion. About 3,000 left shortly after the invasion and about
1,000 more left during September and October.
   ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our
citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even
further and force us to take a tougher attitude,'' Churkin said.
   To his knowledge, Churkin said, no Soviets are being used as
human shields at potential military targets.

   An old floating bridge that collapsed during
heavy weekend rains tore support cables from an adjacent span as it
gave way, threatening the main link between Seattle and its eastern
suburbs, officials say.
   The 50-year-old Lake Washington bridge, which had been closed
for repairs, went down Sunday when its pontoons were swamped
following a storm that devastated the state and dumped 3{ inches of
rain on Seattle.
   At least one person was missing and believed dead because of the
storm, and more than 2,600 people were driven from their homes by
floodwaters.
   As the Lake Washington bridge toppled, it snapped a dozen
support cables on the adjacent Interstate 90 bridge. Even as
engineers decided to re-open the three westbound lanes of that
bridge this morning, they said high winds could cause it to sway or
even collapse.
   ``If a storm comes, it could damage the new bridge,'' said Ron
Kinoshita, a state engineer. ``All that wind velocity could break
the bridge.''
   The National Weather Service said a storm late Wednesday or
Thursday could bring winds of 40 mph. Ron Anderson, district
administrator for the state Department of Transportation, said
winds of 20 mph or more could pose problems. ``We don't want anyone
on the bridge if it's in danger of breaking up,'' Anderson said.
   The year-old I-90 bridge, over which as many as 110,000 cars a
day pass, was closed Monday, causing rush-hour gridlock that
delayed commuters into and out of downtown for nearly an hour.
   With the 1{-mile-long I-90 bridge out, motorists were left with
the choice of driving around the lake, a trip of 20 miles, or
taking the four-lane Evergreen Point bridge, which is normally
jammed.
   This morning, calm weather allowed commuters from the eastern
suburbs to come into Seattle on the I-90 bridge's westbound lanes.
The eastbound lanes remained closed as a platform for repair and
inspection.
   Officials said they could close the bridge again within minutes
if wind picked up.
   The weekend rainstorms caused 20 rivers to flood. Damage was
estimated at $100 million.
   Scot Alan Scott, 28, of Duvall, was presumed drowned after he
was swept into the Snoqualmie River near Seattle on Sunday when he
got out of his stalled car, police said. Firefighters rescued his
wife and 6-month-old son from the river.

   Five Israeli soldiers and at least two
Arab guerrillas were killed today in a clash in southern Lebanon,
and Israeli warplanes later attacked bases of the terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal.
   The fighting began shortly after midnight near Shebaa, a village
on the eastern edge of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone,
after Israeli troops arrived by helicopter to battle a guerrilla
unit, security sources in Lebanon said. It was the third clash with
Palestinians in the security zone in a week.
   An Israeli military communique from Jerusalem said the soldiers
``stormed a ring of four guerrillas who were on their way toward
Israeli territory.'' It said: ``In an exchange of fire at close
range accompanied by the throwing of hand grenades, five soldiers
were killed and another was wounded.''
   Two of the guerrillas were killed and two fled the area,
including one who was wounded, the statement said.
   The Lebanese sources said eight guerrillas were killed in the
fighting, which they said lasted 2{ hours.
   There were also conflicting accounts of how the Israeli soldiers
had died.
   Israel radio said one guerrilla may have been carrying
explosives on his back that blew up when he was shot. Israel's army
radio said at least one Israeli soldier died when a grenade blew up
in his hands.
   Yet another report, from a Lebanese source, said the bodies of
the guerrillas might have been booby-trapped.
   The site of the clash ``is a known infiltration route to Israel
used by terrorists'' and the guerrillas carried explosives, an
Israeli military spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed in a communique from Beirut that it staged the
attack, which came exactly a week after Israeli troops intercepted
another guerrilla squad in roughly the same area. In that battle,
Israeli troops killed four guerrillas of another radical PLO group
backed by Libya, the Palestine Popular Struggle Front of Samir
Goshe, and lost a lieutenant.
   Before Habash's claim, four Israeli fighter-bombers fired 12
rockets into a hilltop position of Abu Nidal's faction, the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, near Sidon, provincial capital of
southern Lebanon.
   Palls of black smoke billowed from the stricken base after the
three-minute air raid, the 19th Israeli air raid in Lebanon this
year. There was no immediate report on casualties.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, split from Yasser
Arafat's mainstream guerrilla faction, Fatah, in the early 1970s.
Since then, he has topped wanted lists around the world for
masterminding scores of bloody terrorist attacks to dramatize the
Palestinian cause.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has sentenced him to death
for killing dozens of aides to Arafat. His Fatah-Revolutionary
Council is Libyan funded and has bases in Lebanon.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said both the border attack and the
bombing raids were part of Israel's ``constant activity by ground,
sea and air ... to ensure the safety of Israelis in the north of
the country.''
   The clash near Shebaa, 28 miles southeaset of Sidon, came two
days after a woman suicide bomber detonated a handbag packed with
explosives as she walked past an Israeli infantry patrol in the
security zone, injuring two soldiers.
   The Israeli navy on Saturday sank a rubber dinghy off the
southrn Lebanon coast, killing five guerrillas of the pro-Syrian
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   The escalating violence sharpened fears that southern Lebanon is
becoming a flash point that could frustrate Syrian-backed President
Elias Hrawi's attempts to assert government authority and end
Lebanon's 15{-year-old civil war.
   Hrawi said over the weekend that he would seek international
help to end Israel's occupation of the security zone once the
government completes plans to get Moslem and Christian militias out
of Beirut.
   Israel carved out the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its
invading army in the summer of 1985, ending a three-year occupation
of much of Lebanon.

<HEAD>Some Employee Health Plans Not Subject to State Insurance Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Self-funded employee health care plans, which
cover some 9.5 million working Americans, are not subject to state
insurance laws and regulations, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court, by a 7-1 vote, said in the case of a seriously
injured Pennsylvania teen-age girl that federal regulation of such
plans pre-empts any state regulation.
   Self-funded plans are those in which all benefits are paid
directly by an employer, and not purchased through an independent
insurance company.
   In an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court said
such health care plans are governed by the federal Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
   ``In view of Congress' clear intent to exempt from direct state
insurance regulation ERISA employee benefit plans, we hold that
ERISA pre-empts (Pennsylvania law),'' O'Connor wrote.
   Justice John Paul Stevens was the sole dissenter. Justice David
H. Souter, who joined the court after the case was argued last
month, did not participate in the decision.
   The Illinois-based FMC Corp. has a self-funded plan for its
employees and their dependents, and that plan paid for a
substantial part of the more than $178,000 in medical expenses
incurred by Cynthia Ann Holliday since a January 1987 automobile
accident in Indiana County, Pa.
   Miss Holliday, then 15, suffered permanent injuries when the car
in which she was a passenger crashed.
   Her father, Gerald, is an FMC employee.
   Holliday sued the car's driver, Robert Lyons, in state court.
Under a settlement, Miss Holliday's financial recovery was limited
to $49,875.50 plus interest.
   When FMC sought to recover some of its expenses by claiming the
lawsuit settlement funds, Holliday successfully invoked a
Pennsylvania law that prohibits such action.
   FMC then turned to a federal trial judge for help, contending
that the federal law, ERISA, was meant to be the sole means of
regulating its health care plan and that it therefore pre-empted
the prohibitive Pennsylvania law.
   The trial judge, and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
ruled against FMC.
   But today's decision reversed the lower court rulings, saying
FMC was right in its contention that the federal law superseded any
state regulation.
   The justices sent the case back to the lower courts, where
presumably FMC will be able to recover the money Miss Holliday won
in the lawsuit against Lyons.
   FMC's appeal to the nation's highest court has been supported by
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Self-Insurance Institute of
America and numerous self-funded health and welfare plans.
   The case is FMC Corp. vs. Holliday, 89-1048.

   Allies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed today to win
quick approval by the Russian republic's congress for the
president's proposed treaty to keep the union together.
   Russian reformers argued the proposal should be discussed
thoroughly by the public before lawmakers vote on it.
   Quick adoption of the union treaty by the largest of the 15
republics would have been a tremendous victory for Gorbachev as he
tries to keep the country from splintering.
   It would have been a defeat for Russia's president, Boris N.
Yeltsin, and other republic leaders who are trying to diminish the
central government's power. Approval of the union treaty would
commit them to remain united with a strong central government
headed by President Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev told legislators he personally lobbied Yeltsin during
a break in the session, according to the independent news service
Interfax.
   ``Naturally, Russia's position on this question has great
significance, for without Russia, there is no union,'' Gorbachev
said.
   As Gorbachev beamed from an isolated balcony in the Grand
Kremlin Palace, his allies in the Congress of Russian Peoples'
Deputies tried to force Yeltsin to include adoption of the treaty
on the congress' agenda.
   The congress is much more loyal to Gorbachev and to the central
government than te smaller Russian Supreme Soviet legislature,
which Yeltsin easily controls. The congress is holding an
extraordinary session to discuss Russia's economic woes and
consider legalizing private land ownership.
   Largely through sheer stubbornness, Yeltsin refused to allow
hard-line Communists to add approval of the treaty to the agenda.
Instead, he called for an ``exchange of opinions'' on the treaty
and won approval by a vote of 696 to 199 with 36 abstentions.
   Despite the failed end-run, Gorbachev insisted that ``in the
end, all the republics will sign the union treaty. Even those who
shout against it won't be able to do anything. They are all just
loudmouths.''
   ``You carry out a referendum and everything will be clear,''
Gorbachev told the Russian legislators, according to Interfax.
   There has been no decision on holding a referendum on the union
treaty. Gorbachev has said repeatedly that he believes most
citizens want the Soviet Union to remain whole.
   However, leaders of six of the 15 republics have said they will
not sign the new union treaty. They are the Ukraine, Georgia,
Armenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
   Yeltsin said earlier this month that Russia would not sign the
treaty unless the republic's ``real sovereignty'' could be assured
and unless the issue of resource ownership was resolved.
   The proposed treaty would give republics control over most areas
except defense and the monetary system. The central government and
the republics would share responsibility for economic development,
transportation, energy and the space program.
   On a more conciliatory note, Yeltsin told lawmakers that
continued confrontation between Russia and the national government
was ``unacceptable.''
   Speaking of his personal differences with Gorbachev, he said
``for such a struggle, we simply don't have any more time.''
   Yeltsin said the Russian leadership understood the central
government's importance to ``the normal functioning of our and
other republics.''
   But he insisted ``we cannot agree to anybody's interference with
problems we can solve ourselves better than anyone else. We shall
do all we can to change this situation.''
   ``Responsibility for the worsening of the republic's affairs
must be carried by federal bodies and destructive forces in the
republic,'' Yeltsin said.
   He vowed that Russia would use ``only political methods'' to
solve its problems and said the army must not be used for any
political purpose.
   Yeltsin said the main task of the congress was to discuss how to
feed the Russian people during the winter. He said this task
threatened to overshadow all other issues.
   ``Delays in solving this problem threaten Russia's revival,'' he
warned.

   The United States has won the backing of
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France for a U.N. resolution
threatening to use ``all necessary means'' to drive Iraq from
Kuwait if it does not leave by January.
   Meanwhile, 18 foreigners, including three Americans, arrived in
the Jordanian capital today after being freed by Iraqi officials.
The Americans were released after their relatives went to Baghdad
to plead for their freedom.
   At the urgent request of Kuwait, the Security Council was
meeting today to hear accusations of Iraqi terror, torture,
imprisonment and summary executions in the emirate. Some Kuwaiti
refugees were to tell the council their stories.
   But the focus was on Security Council action anticipated later
in the week. With Monday's agreement on the use-of-force measure
among the five permanent members, the broad coalition the United
States has mustered against Saddam Hussein crossed a crucial
threshold.
   There had been speculation the Soviets and Chinese might abstain
on the resolution, which the 15-member council is expected to take
up on Thursday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has traveled the globe for
weeks seeking support from Security Council members for the
use-of-force resolution.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov said on Monday he was
``enthusiastic'' about the new measure. The Security Council has
already passed 10 resolutions condeming Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of
Kuwait and imposing trade sanctions.
   This may be the last resolution on the Persian Gulf crisis,
Vorontsov said, ``because we all hope that after this, a peaceful
settlement will be possible.''
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, where most of the multinational force
is deployed, has appealed to Saddam to ``let reason prevail'' and
withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait.
   ``We do not want to see a tragedy befall Iraq,'' the Saudi
monarch said. The remarks, made to a citizens' group in Saudi
Arabia over the weekend, were circulated by Saudi media today.
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal, arrived
in Moscow today for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the Soviet foreign minister, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   Gorbachev met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in the
Kremlin on Monday after telling lawmakers the alliance against Iraq
would not be broken and said aggression ``should be punished.''
   Another Soviet official, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly
Churkin, accused Iraq of preventing hundreds of Soviet citizens
from leaving Iraq.
   It was the first time Moscow had charged that Baghdad was
keeping its citizens against their will.
   Aziz returned to Baghdad on Monday night and accused the
Security Council of pursuing a ``double standard'' by calling for
Iraq's pullout from Kuwait without similarly pressuring Israel to
leave the occupied territories.
   Iraq ``will continue to struggle steadfastly to realize peace
and justice in the region, and to restore first and foremost the
Palestinian Arab people's rights,'' Aziz said on Iraqi radio.
   Under the draft U.N. resolution, Iraq would have to release all
foreign hostages, withdraw its troops and restore Kuwait's
government by Jan. 1 or Jan. 15; the Security Council members have
not yet fixed a date, and the draft contains both dates as options.
   ``It is a pause in which we're all making clear that no new
measures will be taken against Iraq prior to the end of that
period, after which the authorization to use all measures, which is
of course, the United Nations language for measures which include
the use of force, will become available,'' said British Ambassador
David Hannay.
   The resolution would authorize ``member states cooperating with
the government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold
and implement the Security Council resolutions passed in response
to Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, and to restore
international peace and security.''
   It cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use
of military force to counter aggression if sanctions and other
steps fail. The only other time military force was sanctioned by
the United Nations was in 1950, during the Korean conflict.
   The foreign ministers of most Security Council members are
expected to gather in New York on Thursday to adopt the resolution,
with Baker presiding.
   The resolution is supported by at least six of the non-permanent
council members: Canada, Finland, Romania, Ivory Coast, Zaire,
Ethiopia.
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon said his country could not
support it. Yemen, the council's only Arab member, is believed
likely to abstain or vote against it. Malaysia and Colombia's votes
are uncertain.
   A resolution requires at least nine votes to pass, so long as
none of the permanent members vetoes it.
   Britain and the United States favor a Jan. 1 deadline, but U.S.
officials in Washington indicated the resolution and date are
negotiable. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said today that he
favors a Jan. 15 deadline.
   The freed foreigners who arrived in Jordan today are three
Americans, 10 Britons and five Germans. The Americans are John
Stevenson of Panama City, Fla.; Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash.;
and Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill.
   In another development, a Spanish navy corvette, assisting the
U.S. cruiser Philippine Sea and a French destroyer, fired warning
shots to help stop and Iraqi freighter early today in the Red Sea,
Spanish officials said.
   The Iraqi vessel was allowed to continue on its way after it was
inspected by a U.S. Navy boarding party and found to be carrying no
goods that violated the United Nations embargo.

   Sen. Sam Nunn, the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, questioned today whether it is in the
vital interest of the United States to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi
invaders.
   The Georgia Democrat said President Bush's decision to send
200,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf signals a fundamental shift
in policy that raises a number of serious questions.
   ``Is it in our vital interest to liberate Kuwait? How long can
we sustain more than 400,000 troops? Has President Bush limited his
options by creating a use-it-or-lose-it situation?'' Nunn asked at
the start of four days of hearings by his panel on Bush's gulf
policy.
   The hearings were prompted by Bush's decision earlier this month
to send more troops and build an ``offensive military option'' with
a force that will total about 430,000 in the region by January.
   The decision touched off demands by many members of Congress for
closer collaboration with the White House on gulf policy.
   Nunn indicated his support for a possible United Nations
resolution authorizing military force against Iraq unless Saddam
Hussein's troops leave Kuwait. The Security Council is expected to
act on the measure this week.
   However, he said, ``this is not a substitute for fully informing
the American people.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the committee, said,
``It is not enough for President Bush to go to the United Nations
to get approval for the use of military force in the Persian Gulf.
He must also come to Congress.''
   James Schlesinger, former secretary of defense and onetime CIA
director, was the first witness at the hearings.
   Nunn had envisioned that Defense SecretaryDick Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would kick
off the hearings.
   However, Cheney and Powell will delay their appearances before
the panel until next week, after United Nations Security Council
action on a resolution authorizing military force against Iraq
unless Saddam Hussein's troops leave Kuwait.
   The panel's ranking Republican, Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
said Cheney had delayed his testimony until next Monday ``to have a
report from Secretary of State Baker on the U.N. resolution.''
   Secretary James A. Baker III is in New York to press the
Security Council to approve the resolution. Baker is to testify
Dec. 5 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Monday that Cheney and
Powell ``were not too eager'' to testify while the United Nations
was debating the resolution. Powell is scheduled to testify with
Cheney on Monday.
   The absence of the administration's top defense officials - and
the lack of a guarantee they would testify at all - fueled
speculation about a struggle between Nunn, a possible 1992
Democratic challenger for Bush's job, and the White House.
   Nunn has been critical of the administration's policy since Bush
announced the additional deployment of troops earlier this month.
   A Republican on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Malcolm
Wallop of Wyoming, called the hearings ill-timed while the
administration ``is trying to finish the diplomatic end game.''
   The timing of the hearings, he said, ``is what you do when your
purpose is more political than policy. Not partisan politics,
national politics. The chairman is opening a presidential
campaign,'' Wallop said, referring to Nunn.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., asked that the
House be called back from adjournment to discuss the U.N.
resolution, lest war be raging by the time Congress returns in
January.
   Schroeder, a senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee, had contended two weeks ago it would be useless for
Congress to return in a special session to debate a hypothetical
action. ``All of a sudden the time has come,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
   Several congressional leaders, including Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole, asked earlier this month for a special session,
but that idea quickly died. Instead, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, called for hearings by several panels.

   A snowstorm today coated firefighters and their
equipment with ice, but officials were confident they had a handle
on a blaze feeding on millions of gallons of jet fuel at Stapleton
International Airport.
   ``The flames are not near as intense as they have been. Things
are boiling down to a simmer,'' said Fire Department spokesman Mike
McNeill.
   As snow fell, about 60 firefighters sprayed water and foam on
the fire burning an 800,000-gallon tank and a 350,000-gallon tank.
The fire today did not pose a threat to the eight other storage
tanks a half-mile from the airport tower, officials said.
   The fire, which started Sunday, reduced two 400,000-gallon tanks
to smoldering, crumpled hulks. The tank farm had a 12.5-million
gallon capacity.
   McNeill said he expected one of the tanks to burn itself out by
mid-afternoon and the other by sometime Wednesday.
   ``This is a little fire, by comparison to what it was,'' airport
spokesman Richard Boulware said today.
   Temperatures dropped below freezing Monday night, and the
sprayed water froze on firefighters' clothing and equipment. Snow
from the storm that began shortly before midnight Monday added
moisture but also left dangerous layers of ice.
   The storm also knocked out pumps that firefighters had hoped to
use to drain fuel.
   Fire Chief Richard Gonzales said all firefighters can do is let
the fire burn itself out.
   ``You've got to let it consume itself. You physically can't
smother it,'' Gonzales said.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation.
   Temperatures near the fire reached 3,500 degrees, well beyond
the melting point of iron and too hot for investigators to inspect
control valves where the flames were first spotted. The valves are
under several feet of water and foam.
   ``We don't know what's left down there at all,'' said arson
investigator Ted Baldwin.
   A maintenance man performed routine chores 2{ hours before the
blaze was spotted, said George Doughty, Denver aviation director.
He also said there was no apparent break-in of the 8-foot
chain-link fence capped with barbed wire.
   United Airlines, which owned the tanks, said it lost 2.6 million
gallons of fuel to the fire, including about 400,000 from a 24-inch
pipeline, but that all but a few of the airline's flights departed
on time Monday.
   No other airlines' operations were affected Monday.
   Firefighters by midday Monday had used 15,000 gallons of foam to
contain the blaze and had poured about 24 million gallons of water
on the fire - approximately one-fourth of Denver's water use on an
average fall day.
   The tanks that were destroyed were built in 1976 and probably
won't be replaced. A new airport is scheduled for completion in the
mid-1990s.
   In the interim, Doughty said, fuel will be stored in a pair of
million-gallon tanks built in 1985 for a now-defunct airline.
   City officials said the new airport will feature a safer design.
New building codes require control valves to be farther from the
tanks so they can be shut off during a fire.

   Lawmakers in Moldavia today angrily rejected the
election of a parliament by people in eastern Moldavia who want to
form a separate republic, the official Tass news agency said.
   The development was the latest in a series of conflicts
nationwide that have struck many of the 15 republics, as they
themselves seek greater autonomy from the Kremlin. Some ethnic
minorities within republics have declared allegiance to the Kremlin
against leaders in their own republics.
   More than 380,000 voters in the self-proclaimed ``Dniester
republic,'' a Russian-speaking area along the Dniester River in
eastern Moldavia, chose the new parliament in an election on
Sunday, the official news agency said.
   Leaders in the region, which had declared its sovereignty Sept.
2, said the new government would protect residents, mostly
Ukrainians and Russians, from alleged discrimination by majority
Moldavians, who speak Romanian.
   However, Moldavia's Supreme Soviet legislature today voted to
declare the Dniester election null and void after the legislature's
deputy speaker said the balloting had been rigged, Tass reported.
   ``In a number of constituencies, voting results were falsified
and meetings with candidates, who had not been nominated by worker
collectives, were held after the polls,'' said Deputy Speaker
Victor Pushkash, Tass reported.
   The legislature called for self-restraint.
   Ethnic tensions turned violent last month when Moldavian
security troops clashed with Dniester activists in the region,
leaving four dead.
   Another secessionist group, the Gagauz minority in the
republic's southern corner, also has declared sovereignty and is
negotiating with Moldavian officials.

   Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait have killed
children in front of their parents and tortured prisoners with
electric shocks and by beating the soles of their feet, Kuwait's
government-in-exile said today.
   Kuwaiti U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan said ``116 days have
passed since the flagrant Iraqi aggression against all
international laws and covenants, especially against the laws and
values of our Islamic religion.''
   ``Individual and mass arrests are unabated ... brutal torture of
Kuwaitis continues in Kuwait itself'' and in Iraqi prisons,
Abulhasan said.
   Kuwait introduced a draft resolution before the Security Council
asking the United Nations to take custody of all its census and
demographic records, which were smuggled out of Kuwait on 25
computer discs after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraq has been seizing and destroying all citizenship records
from Kuwaiti citizens in an attempt to erase their national
identity, and has moved more than 100,000 Iraqis into occupied
Kuwait to change its demographic character.
   As the Security Council members began their session, they gazed
at enlargements of color photographs placed in the council chamber
showing mutilated Kuwaiti citizens.
   At the urgent request of Kuwait, the Security Council took up
the issue today and Wednesday, hearing from six or seven Kuwaiti
refugees who escaped their homeland.
   The Security Council's rules allow non-diplomats to address the
body, but U.N. officials with up to 30 years' experience said they
could not recall the council ever hearing such testimony.
   The debate on alleged Iraqi brutality is expected to harden the
Security Council's resolve for Thursday, when the five permanent
members introduce a resolution that would allow U.S.-allied troops
to drive Iraq from Kuwait if Saddam Hussein does not withdraw by
January.
   Abulhasan also plans to show the council members videotape to
support his assertions.
   Iraq has denied Kuwait's accusations of rights abuse since its
invasion of Kuwait and no longer replies to individual allegations.
Abulhasan's charges could not be independently verified.
   In a letter to the Security Council, Abulhasan said that ``over
the last three weeks, the occupying forces have shown their true
colors and revealed themselves as perfidious and depraved.''
   He cited eyewitness accounts of the murder of children,
including a Palestinian who said he and other drivers were detained
in Kuwait.
   ``Then the street they were in was cleared and all who lived
there were interrogated. The soldiers then opened fire on five
little Kuwaiti girls who were blindfolded,'' Abulhasan said.
   In another incident, ``Iraqi soldiers opened fire and killed
three Kuwaiti children in front of a supermarket.
   ``The children, aged 7 to 8 years old, were innocently chanting
the national anthem of Kuwait and shouting the name of Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir, as a group of Iraqi soldiers opened
fire and shot them dead in front of their mother, who had a nervous
breakdown,'' Abulhasan said.
   In another instance, army troops arrested three small girls. Ten
days later they returned them to their homes, and opened fire on
them in full view of their parents, said Abulhasan.
   Mullahs at mosques who did not cooperate in spreading propaganda
for Saddam's ruling Baath Party have been killed or tortured, he
said.
   Torture victims, including Indians, Moroccans, Egyptians and
Kuwaitis, report a typical pattern of abuse, said Abulhasan.
   ``Detainees were continually tortured by havin electric cables
attached to sensitive parts of their bodies and were whipped on the
soles of the feet until they bled,'' Abulhasan said.

   Families of soldiers in China are called
``glorious families,'' making the Song family near Beijing glorious
four times over. Its 19-year-old quadruplet sons have all signed up
to join the army.
   ``The government has helped to raise the four of us, so we want
to serve the country in the army in return,'' the official China
Daily newspaper on Monday quoted one of the four, Song Jianjie, as
saying.
   Their birth captured public interest in 1971, and the government
gave a special subsidy to the family to help feed the boys, the
newspaper said.
   The four grew up in Changping County, a rural area outside
Beijing. They reported last week for their army physicals.
   Under Chinese law, all males 18 and over may be drafted, but in
practice annual recruitment quotas are filled largely by
volunteers. Most are peasants who hope to be eligible for jobs in
cities after their three years of service are up.

   A businessman helping an out-of-towner
with a stalled car was killed when a runaway dump truck crashed
into a parking lot, struck the car and covered him in tons of
steaming asphalt.
   Truck driver Terry Conner, 42, told police he was approaching a
busy intersection Monday when an indicator showed a loss of brake
pressure.
   ``His only option was to run into the traffic at the light or
turn off into the parking lot,'' Police Officer Steve Tinder said.
   The truck crashed into a bank parking lot, striking three cars
before dumping the asphalt and tipping over.
   The asphalt engulfed Charles H. Sprankle, general manager of a
property management company.
   Sprankle, 71, was trying to help Miles Schlapik of Miami start a
rented Cadillac when the accident occurred.
   ``He was trying to get my hood up to help,'' Schlapik said. ``I
shook his hand and told him he was a fine person.''
   Schlapik went across the street to a gasoline station to get a
mechanic. Sprankle waited. When Schlapik returned, Sprankle was
under more than 3 feet of asphalt.
   Conner escaped injury, and no charges were filed.

   A series of earthquakes shook the
central Yugoslav Adriatic coast early Tuesday, halting rail traffic
and causing slight damage but no injuries, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
   The strongest quake, measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale, struck
at 5:38 a.m. local time, the report said.
   The quake's epicenter was in the Dinara mountains, about 18
miles northeast of the central Adriatic port of Split, Tanjug said.
   Landslides apparently caused by the quake stopped rail traffic
on the main line between Split and central Yugoslavia.
   Tanjug said the tremors caused cracks in the walls of older
houses and panic among residents.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.

<HEAD>Official Suggests Marijuana-Generated Electricity</HEAD>

   A top state official claims his idea of
burning marijuana to generate electrcity is far from a pipe dream.
   New South Wales state Minerals and Energy Minister Neil Pickard
told Parliament on Tuesday that he had asked the Electricity
Commission to examine the possibility of burning confiscated pot
crops to generate electricity.
   ``Marijuana burns at extremely high temperatures and gives off
considerable heat energy,'' he said.
   Pickard's comments were greeted with uproarious laughter, but he
said it was a serious proposition.
   He said burning marijuana would be cheaper than coal and produce
about as much energy. The Electricity Commission would look into
what modifications would be needed for power stations to handle
marijuana as well as coal, Pickard said.
   He said the state's power stations use an average of 20 million
tons of coal a year.

   Officials in the central Philippines
were angry Tuesday after relief checks sent by President Corazon
Aquino to help rebuild typhoon-devastated areas bounced.
   Sen. John Osmena quoted his brother, Cebu Gov. Emilio Osmena, as
saying local officials received checks from the government
totalling $125,000 to help recover from Typhoon Mike, which struck
the country Nov. 13-14.
   But when officials tried to cash the checks Monday, Cebu
government banks said there was no money in the accounts.
   ``The people of Cebu were very much hurt. ... What they gave us
was very little - and even it bounced,'' the senator said.
   Provincial officials said they were told later that the funds
were deposited in Manila banks on Friday and that there had not
been enough time to notify branches in Cebu, 350 miles south.

   A river of lava from erupting Mount
Kelud killed four people in the east Java town of Blitar, police
said Tuesday.
   Lava had been streaming down the volcano without threatening
people. But on Sunday it surged from the mountain and spilled out
of the existing flow, hitting houses, bridges and farms in the
Blitar region, police said.
   Blitar is about 550 miles east of Jakarta, the capital of
Indonesia.
   Police said four people were killed and at least 77 families
were left homeless. The homeless were being resettled in temporary
housing, local officials said.
   Blitar, about 20 miles south of the 5,679-foot Mount Kelud, was
badly damaged by falling dust, gravel and rocks blown over a radius
of 31 miles when the volcano erupted in February.
   At least 24 people were killed and more than 350 houses were
damaged during the eruption.

   The government declared a state of
emergency today following weeks of violence by opposition forces
demanding the resignation of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad.
   Ershad said in a televised speech that the emergency was being
imposed to safeguard the country's internal security in the face of
what he called a conspiracy to destroy the nation's economy.
   The proclamation suspended all civil rights and imposed press
censorship. An indefinite curfew was imposed on Dhaka, the capital
city of 7 million people, and the government arrested a top
opposition leader.
   The action followed another day of rioting which left one person
dead and an estimated 100 injured.
   Students poured into the streets of the Dhaka University campus,
a focus of many anti-government demonstrations, shouting: ``We
don't accept the emergency!'' and ``Down with Ershad!''
   Sheik Hasina, leader of the Awami League, was taken from her
husband's home in Dhaka and was later shifted to the residence of
her late father, former President Sheik Mujibur Rahman, her
spokesman said.
   Soon after news of her arrest spread thousands of people took to
the street protesting her detention, witnesses said. The turmoil
prompted the government to announce the curfew.
   The opposition has been demanding that Ershad quit and allow an
interim government to suprevise presidential elections, claiming a
fair vote was impossible under his rule.
   Ershad has refused to step aside, but has called an election for
next year and invited international observers to attend, including
former President Jimmy Carter.
   Ershad, a former army general, seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1982. He later retired from the military and stood twice for
elections, which diplomats and journalists said were rigged in his
favor.
   A teacher at Dhaka University was shot and killed earlier today
in a battle between rival opposition factions in the third day of
political violence on the campus.
   More than 30 students were wounded when dissidents in the
student faction of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party attacked a
march by students from an umbrella group of opposition parties.
   The rival student groups clashed with guns, bombs and other
lethal weapons, witnesses said. Dr. Shamsul Alam Milon, a teacher
at Dhaka Medical Colleges, died of bullet wounds, and doctors said
one student was serious wounded.
   It is difficult to get an exact count of casualties because many
wounded students avoid hospitals where they may be arrested on
charges of rioting, for which they could be jailed for up to seven
years.
   The rift in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party's student
supporters worsened after party leader Khaleda Zia expelled six
students for hooliganism and ``anti-party activities'' last week.
   Campus sources said the dissidents fired on a procession of
students, including Mrs. Zia's supporters, who were marching to
condemn what they called terrorism on campus. The clash quickly
caused trouble in other areas around the university.
   Milon was the second casualty of this week's campus unrest,
following the death Monday of a worker at the student dormitories.
Eight people were killed last month by police during
anti-government riots.
   In a separate incident, 30 more students were injured in a
pitched battle with police using batons and tear gas. The students
were protesting the arrest of Mostafa Mohsin Montu, leader of the
student wing of the Awami League.
   Witnesses said the second incident began when several thousand
students pelted a police van with stones as it took the Awami
League leader, Montu, from his home. When police responded with
tear gas, the mob rampaged through the streets, vandalizing shops
and vehicles. Police and paramilitary forces rushed to the area to
prevent the riot from spreading.
   The Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League are
leading the anti-Ershad campaign, but their followers frequently
clash with each other and among themselves.

<TEXT>
   Increased fighting between Israel and
guerrillas in southern Lebanon could undermine President Elias
Hrawi's effort to disband unruly militias and extend state
authority after 15{ years of civil war.
   Palestinian, leftist and Moslem guerrilla factions apparently
are stepping up their attacks on the Israelis and their militia
allies. Israel is expected to retaliate by intensifying its
military actions in the volatile region.
   In the past week, Israel has intercepted four guerrilla raids by
land and sea. Six Israelis and 19 guerrillas have been killed.
   The Israeli casualties are the worst since eight soldiers were
killed in a car bombing in Israel's self-declared ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon Oct. 19, 1988. The two bombers were also
killed.
   The Israelis retaliated for the latest raid Monday night with
air strikes Tuesday on bases used by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal's guerrillas and the radical Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine. It was the 19th air raid on Lebanese targets this
year.
   Since the Palestinians moved into southern Lebanon in 1970, the
region has been in the grip of an endless cycle of violence.
   Guerrilla attacks provoked Israeli reprisals and at least two
Israeli invasions in 1978 and 1982. Thousands of people have been
killed.
   There are about 5,000 hard-core PLO guerrillas in the south, and
hundreds more from other factions.
   The Israelis say they have not detected any major influx of
guerrillas following the withdrawal this month of Christian and
Moslem militias from Beirut under Hrawi's drive to demilitarize the
capital area as part of an Arab League-brokered peace plan.
   But Shiite Moslem militias say they have evacuated hundreds of
fighters and heavy weapons from their Beirut strongholds.
   The Israelis have voiced alarm at a peace treaty between the
Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
Syrian-backed Shiite Amal movement. The pact ended a three-year
power struggle between the factions, for the time being at least.
   That accord, brokered by Syria and Iran, called for ``joint
operations'' against the Israelis in southern Lebanon.
   The Israelis believe that signals an intensification of attacks
on the security zone by the fundamentalist Hezbollah.
   The commander of Israel's northern sector, Gen. Yossi Peled,
said in an interview with Israel Radio last week: ``It would be
natural for Amal and Hezbollah to shift their hostility toward us
after they've decided to stop fighting each other.''
   Israel carved out the 440-square-mile security zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its army in mid-1985 after a three-year
occupation of southern Lebanon.
   The zone, which runs from the Mediterranean coast in the west to
the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a buffer against
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel. It is manned by 1,000
Israelis and 3,000 militiamen of the mainly Christian,
Israeli-armed South Lebanon Army.
   Political sources in Beirut, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the violence in the south could thwart Hrawi's hopes of
disarming Lebanon's private armies.
   Hrawi ``can try to move against militias that challenge state
authority, but neither Hrawi nor Syria would try to crush a militia
that vows to fight Israel, at least under the slogan of liberating
Lebanese territory,'' said a prominent Moslem politician speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Hrawi would ``either have to get the Lebanese army involved in
effective resistance efforts against Israel - very risky because it
might provoke another Israeli invasion - or forget about disbanding
the militias,'' the politician said.
   Hrawi, like his predecessors, demands the Israelis abandon the
occupied zone in the south.
   The Syrians, the real power in much of Lebanon, have said they
will not leave Lebanon until the Israelis do - and the Israelis
have shown no sign of doing that.

tried to take their own lives, but were inspired to change through
`Rhythm Nation,''' Miss Jackson said.
   The awards are given by Billboard magazine and are based on the
artists' record sales.
   Other winners included M.C. Hammer, for top pop and rap artist,
and Sinead O'Connor, for the top-ranking worldwide hit single
``Nothing Compares 2 U.''

   LONDON (AP) - J.M. Coetzee, whose novel ``Age of Iron'' takes
the form of a white South African widow's letter to her daughter in
America, has won Britain's richest fiction prize.
   South African actress Janet Suzman picked up the $39,000 Sunday
Express Book of the Year award on Coetzee's behalf Monday at a
literary luncheon.
   ``Age of Iron'' is the South African author's first book in four
years. Coetzee won acclaim for his earlier novels ``Waiting for the
Barbarians'' and ``Life and Times of Michael K.''
   The Sunday Express newspaper presents its award annually for
``the most enjoyable and compulsively readable book published in
Britain.''
   The book's monologues reflect a woman's guilt over apartheid - a
``gathering feeling of walking over black faces'' - and her efforts
to be a mother figure to those around her.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - The Duchess of York's sister, Jane
Makim, was awarded $234,000 in damages Tuesday by a jury that ruled
three newspapers defamed her in 1988.
   The jurors found that The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph
and The Australian implied Mrs. Makim had an affair with Argentine
polo player Horatio Lanusse and wrongfully attempted or threatened
to remove her two children from Australia.
   Mrs. Makim, the 33-year-old sister of the former Sarah Ferguson,
now Britain's Duchess of York, said, ``My reputation has been
totally vindicated.'' In addition to the award valued at $234,000
in U.S. currency, Nationwide News, publisher of the three
Sydney-based newspapers, must pay interest and Mrs. Makim's legal
fees.
   Mrs. Makim was separated from her rancher husband, Alex Makim,
11 months ago. She wept as she told the jury she was ``embarrassed
and humiliated'' by the articles. The publisher's attorney, Ian
Callinan, argued she suffered no damage from the stories.

   LIMA, Ohio (AP) - Stacy Arthur, who posed nude for the January
centerfold of Playboy magazine, says the photographs have caused
problems with her fellow contestants in the Mrs. America Pageant.
   ``Some of the other girls are very upset about it. I have gotten
a lot of flak,'' Ms. Arthur said Monday in an interview with Lima
radio station WIMA.
   ``But the pageant system is not going to stop me from competing.
They are going to let me compete. They say it would not hinder my
odds (or) my chances of winning,'' said Ms. Arthur, who was crowned
Mrs. Ohio June 17.
   Ms. Arthur, 22, said she was not the first Mrs. America
contestant to pose for Playboy.
   The Mrs. America pageant is being held in the Soviet Union in
conjunction with the Mrs. USSR pageant. Winners are to be selected
December 4, according to a news release from Playboy, and the
pageants are to be televised in the spring.
   Ms. Arthur and her husband, James, live in Sidney, about 30
miles north of Dayton, and run a ceramics shop there.

   The Smoke Police will keep a wary eye
on Jacksonville's youth if a city councilman has his way.
   Councilman Harry Reagan wants to create a special anti-smoking
police force to ticket underage smokers and stores that sell them
cigarettes. He said the unit would be financed by licensing fees
paid by the stores.
   Police could write tickets for fines ranging from $25 to $500,
citing businesses or employees that sell cigarettes to anyone under
18 and citing the minors who buy them.
   Reagan's proposed ordinance has the backing of the Coalition for
a Drug-Free Jacksonville, a group of business and civic leaders
opposed to drug abuse. It says tobacco is a ``gateway drug,'' the
first used by many teens.
   Reagan said several other council members also support his plan.
   One opponent, Councilwoman Sandra Darling, said police shouldn't
be in charge of regulating public health.
   And Randy Valentine, manager of Consolidated Cigarette Service,
a vending machine company, said he was worried that the proposal
could lead to the ticketing of honest businessmen who accidentally
or unknowingly sell to minors.
   ``I'm just afraid that it will be used in an ugly way to entrap
people,'' he said.

   Passengers on a flight down the California
coast from San Jose to San Luis Obispo got an unexpected side trip
when the pilots accidentally landed at the Santa Maria airport.
   Federal aviation officials are still trying to figure out why
the commuter flight made the wrong turn.
   The Wings West flight 5148, carrying nine passengers and a crew
of two, landed by mistake in clear weather Saturday at Santa Maria,
36 miles away from its intended destination.
   After landing, the Fairchild Metro twin-engine turbo-prop plane
went on to San Luis Obispo.
   Wings West President John Selvaggio said the company, a
subsidiary of American Airlines, is conducting its own
investigation and won't say what may have caused the mixup.
   The pilots, if found to be at fault, could face federal
punishment ranging from retesting of skills to license suspension,
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke said.
   Pilots have several ways to keep track of their position.
Officials said they use projected flight times in addition to
navigational equipment to track their progress.
   They are also supposed to look out the window.

   Eighteen foreigners - three Americans, 10
Britons and five Germans - arrived in the Jordanian capital today
after being freed by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
   The Americans, waving Iraqi and American flags, and the Britons
were released after their relatives went to Baghdad to plead for
their freedom.
   John Stevenson of Panama City, Fla.; Fred Harrington of
Bellevue, Wash.; and Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill., complained
they were ignored by the Bush administration. They said only their
relatives helped free them.
   The Bush administration has refused to negotiate the release of
American hostages, saying Iraq should free them all
unconditionally. The State Department has urged Americans not to go
to Iraq, saying they could become hostages themselves or play into
the hands of Iraqi propagandists.
   ``I believe it is time we started talking,'' said Jesse, whose
freedom was secured by his wife, Honey, after she flew to Baghdad
on Thanksgiving Day.
   ``Perhaps it is time we women did the work,'' Mrs. Jesse said,
smiling and snuggling close to her husband, who was wearing a neck
brace that he refused to comment on. ``We work better where men
fail,'' she added.
   Jesse was among the Westerners rounded by the Iraqis a few days
after the takeover of Kuwait, while his wife left the occupied
emirate on Sept. 1.
   Stevenson, a computer specialist who worked in Kuwait for 11
years, was released after his twin sister, Mary Trundy of Brockton,
Mass., his brothers, Bill Stevenson of Panama City, Fla., and James
Stevenson of Sarasota, Fla., visited Baghdad.
   Harringon was freed when his son, Vala Fouroohi, flew to
Baghdad.
   The 18 freed foreigners reached Amman aboard two Iraqi Airways
flights.
   The five Germans had been in hiding in Kuwait since Aug. 7, five
days after Iraq seized control of the Persian Gulf emirate.
   The Germans said they could not reach Baghdad in time to join
104 of their countrymen who flew out of the Iraqi capital on Sunday
after Saddam ordered the release of all German nationals.
   The Britons were freed after their wives or daughters flew to
Baghdad and met with Saddam, who ordered their release in
appreciation of ``the women's visit and the role of women in
general.''
   The Americans' relatives also met widam.
   The Americans and the Britons were accompanied by their
relatives. The women in the British group carried flowers; the
Americans waved the U.S. and Iraqi flags.
   The Germans expressed concern for Westerners left behind.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been barred from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait, and some are being held at strategic sites in hope of
warding off any attack by the U.S.-led multinational force.
   ``There are a lot of people still hiding in various parts of
Kuwait,'' Wruck Uwe, a German commercial photographer. ``The
telephone system in Kuwait is still good, and we kept in touch with
a lot of others like us.''
   According to U.S. State Department figures, more than 900,000 of
the estimated 3 million foreigners who were in Kuwait and Iraq on
Aug. 2 have left.
   The remaining 2 million, the vast majority Asian and Arab
workers, are expected to try to depart.
   Some foreigners, mostly women married to Iraqis or Kuwaitis,
have elected to stay. Some governments and independent public
figures have negotiated the release of their nationals.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees
he will not be attacked. On Nov. 18, he offered to free all
foreigners between Dec. 25 and March 25, apparently seeking to
forestall a U.S.-led assault.
   Western governments and others have said they will not negotiate
any releases because they believe Saddam is trying to divide the
coalition assembled against him since the occupation of Kuwait.
   However, former officials from several nations have gone to
Baghdad and won the release of their citizens. The missions have
drawn criticism, but have resulted in the release of some hostages.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today refused to
reconsider its decision setting aside former White House aide
Oliver L. North's three felony Iran-Contra convictions.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied a petition by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh that the 12-member court
rehear the case decided July 20 by a split three-judge panel.
   The decision sends the case back to U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell, who must hold a hearing to determine if the 1987
testimony North gave Congress under a limited grant of immunity
from prosecution had unfairly seeped into the trial.
   Walsh probably will appeal today's decision to the Supreme
Court, an action that would delay the lower court hearing if the
justices agree to consider the case.
   Walsh issued a statement today saying: ``We appreciate the
extended consideration that was given to our petition for
rehearing. We are studying the opinions and in all probability will
petition (the Supreme Court) because of the importance of the
questions involved.''
   In its July 20 decision, the three-judge panel set aside the
three convictions pending such a hearing by Gesell. It also
reversed outright one of the convictions, ruling that Gesell had
given improper jury instructions on two points.
   North was convicted of helping to prepare a false chronology of
the Iran-Contra affair for Congress, altering or destroying
National Security Council documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity - the installation of a security fence outside his home.
   Gesell placed the retired Marine lieutenant colonel on
probation, fined him $150,000 and ordered him to perform 1,200
hours of community service.
   The appeals court did not indicate how its members voted on
whether to rehear the case, though two judges did not participate
for undisclosed reasons. Seven votes are needed for the full court
to rehear a case already decided by a three-judge panel.
   In a separate order, the three-judge panel reaffirmed all but
one section of its July 20 opinion. The change did not affect the
outcome of the 2-1 decision, which drew a dissent at the time from
Chief Judge Patricia Wald.
   The panel withdrew a section of its July 20 opinion stating that
Gesell had improperly instructed the jury on how to reach a
unanimous verdict on the count involving destruction of documents.
   The panel admitted that it had misread the trial record and
found that Gesell had given a proper instruction on reaching a
unanimous verdict on that count.
   But the panel, again over Wald's dissent, stuck by its earlier
decision that Gesell had improperly told the jury to ignore
evidence that North thought he was acting with authority of his
superiors in the Reagan administration when he altered or destroyed
documents.
   Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg dissented from the full court's refusal
to reconsider this question.
   ``A majority of the panel held that a government official may
not be convicted ... of altering, concealing or shredding official
documents if he believed, however unreasonably, that his actions
were legal,'' Ginsburg wrote of the July decision by Circuit Judges
Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle, two appointees of President
Reagan.
   A federal grand jury still is investigating the roles of other
Reagan administration officials in the Iran-Contra affair. North
has used the July 20 decision as a basis for refusing to testify
before that panel. He had been questioned several times by the
grand jury before that decision.

<HEAD>Ex-Regulator Says DeConcini Offered Deal on Keating's Behalf</HEAD>

   Former banking regulator Edwin J. Gray said
today that Sen. Dennis DeConcini offered a deal in a 1987 meeting
to have a disputed regulation withdrawn on behalf of Charles
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   Gray, in dramatic testimony before the Senate Ethics Committee,
described the April 2, 1987, meeting he had with the DeConcini, an
Arizona Democrat, and three other senators.
   Gray said DeConcini asked him to withdraw a Federal Home Loan
Bank Board regulation limiting the ability of state-chartered
savings and loans, such as Keating's, to make risky speculative
investments.
   The ex-regulator also said that DeConcini said that, in return,
Lincoln would be willing to make more home mortgage loans, the
traditional business of savings and loans.
   ``DeConcini said, `We're very concerned about this direct
investment regulation of yours. We're concerned it's
unconstitutional. We'd like you to withdraw it until we can find
out if it's constitutional. If you can do that, we'll get our
friend at Lincoln to make more home loans.'''
   Gray said he told the senators he would not do that, and the
senators went on to other issues, raising concerns about the length
of the bank board's examination of Lincoln and its appraisal of
Lincoln's assets.
   None of the so-called Keating Five senators under investigation
by the ethics panel were present for Gray's testimony. The
committeewas holding its sixth day of hearings into allegations
the senators improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of
Keating, a major financial contributor to the campaigns of each.
   Besides DeConcini, senators under scrutiny are Republican John
McCain of Arizona, and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Alan Cranston
of California, and Donald Riegle of Michigan. All but Riegle
attended the April 2, 1987, meeting with Gray, and all five
attended a meeting with San Francisco-based regulators a week
later, after being referred by Gray.
   Gray said that DeConcini ``was the least passive'' of the four
senators in the meeting, but that all asked questions.
   ``I considered it to be improper,'' Gray said of the session.
   Gray said DeConcini was the host of the meeting and opened it by
saying, ``We're here to talk about our friend from Lincoln
Savings.''
   No aides were present. Gray said his office had been instructed
by DeConcini's office for no staff to be present - a directive
DeConcini denies issuing.
   Gray, who was the Reagan administration's chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board from 1983 to 1987, said he felt
intimidated by the meeting with four senators. He stressed that
DeConcini used the word ``we'' in making the request.
   ``I felt awkward and pressured,'' he said. ``The whole setting
was an intimidating one under these circumstances because I had
never had a meeting like this before.''
   But under repeated questioning by the committee's special
counsel, Robert S. Bennett, Gray said he never protested to the
senators that the meeting was improper. And he said they never
threatened him by taking action against legislation he wanted, to
strengthen the board's ability to shut down bankrupt thrifts.
   ``I needed their votes desperately for the legislation we were
pushing. It was not my intent to get in a fight with these people
when I needed their votes,'' Gray said.
   Gray also testified that, a month earlier, Riegle was the first
senator to raise the issue of Keating's thrift and its opposition
to regulations limiting its ability to invest directly in
speculative ventures.
   ``He pulled me aside and said, `You know there are some senators
out West who are very unhappy about the bank board's handling of
Lincoln and I think you ought to talk to them,''' Gray said.
   Gray said he protested that Keating had been telling people the
two were feuding and that Gray had a ``vendetta'' against him -
something he said was untrue. ``I went through how Charles Keating
had been making these accusations,'' he said.
   Keating's Irvine, Calif., institution collapsed and was seized
by the federal government in 1989. Its cost to taxpayers, estimated
at $2 billion, has made it a symbol of the savings and loan
industry debacle.
   Gray read a 13-page opening statement Monday that recalled how
the easing of federal controls in the 1980s fueled the savings and
loan crisis.
   Gray described Lincoln as ``a cash cow,'' able to use federally
insured deposits to buy and sell stocks, participate in leveraged
buyouts, build and run hotels, operate real estate ventures and
engage in other risky, direct equity investments.

Thanksgiving weekend, taking in a whopping $28.7 million for the
No. 1 spot at the box office.
   In second place and off to a faster start than its predecessor
is ``Three Men and a Little Lady.'' The first sequel from the Walt
Disney Co. took in $19.1 million in its premiere engagement,
Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday.
   In 1987, ``Three Men and a Baby'' - also starring Ted Danson,
Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg - took in $13.9 million its first
weekend. It went on to make $167.8 million.
   The action-adventure sequel ``Predator II'' opened in third
place with $13.3 million. Actor-director Kevin Costner's Western,
``Dances With Wolves,'' was fourth with $12.7 million. ``Rocky V''

   ``Home Alone,'' produced and written by John Hughes, stars
Macaulay Culkin as an 8-year-old accidentally left behind at
Christmas when his family leaves for a Paris vacation. The boy uses
his wits to fight off burglars.

   ``Everyone seems to be coming and we're getting a lot of repeat
business,'' said Tom Sherak, head of marketing and distribution for
20th Century Fox.
   ``We look at some of the (box-office) grosses from some of those
small cities and wonder where the audiences will come from the next
day.''
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Wednesday through Sunday

<HEAD>Pentagon Estimates Iraq Has 450,000 Troops in Kuwait Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said today its latest estimates
indicate Iraq has 450,000 troops in the Kuwaiti theater of
operations, an increase of 20,000 over last week.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said half the troops are
inside Kuwait itself. The troops are mainly defensive in nature,
but ``have the ability to go on the offensive'' if necessary, he
said.
   According to the Pentagon's most recent estimate, Iraq has 3,600
tanks in the area, up from 3,500 last week; 2,200 armored personnel
carriers; and 2,400 pieces of artillery, an increase of 100 pieces.
   Williams said the latest estimates reflect the ``fine-tuning''
of U.S. figures as well as Iraqi troop movements.
   ``Iraq continues to move forces around within Iraq and within
the Kuwaiti theater of operations,'' he said.
   Williams said the any Iraqi build-up in the Kuwaiti theater is a
further indication that Saddam Hussein has no intention of
complying with U.N. resolutions seeking to force his withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   While the Iraqis appear to be moving more people into the Kuwait
region, the Defense Department has no evidence that Iraq has moved
on its pledge of last week to activate new divisions and call up
additional reservists. ``We haven't seen any sign of that yet,''
Williams said.
   President Bush announced recently that the United States would
increase its troop levels in the Persian Gulf by 200,000. Some
230,000 troops are already in the area, mainly in Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>State: 85 Percent of Shores Oiled by Exxon Valdez Sufficiently
Cleaned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 85 percent of the rocky shores oiled
in the Exxon Valdez disaster have been sufficiently cleaned,
Alaska's oil-spill coordinator said as the state released next
year's cleanup plan.
   ``The last 15 percent might come hard, but there's just not all
that much left to do,'' Ernie Piper said Monday.
   The plan repeats the state's contention that Exxon Corp. should
complete the cleanup next year. It is intended to clarify which
areas the state believes still need treatment.
   ``Next summer the big, tough decision is going to be made: How
much oil to leave behind,'' Piper said. ``It's one of the biggest
decisions since statehood.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil in Prince William Sound after it struck a reef on March
24, 1989. A total of 1,285 miles of shore extending into the Gulf
of Alaska were coated with oil, and countless birds and sea mammals
were killed.
   The plan includes a summary of conditions at 757 ``shoreline
segments,'' based on a fall survey. The state has determined 404 of
those segments need no more treatment.
   Oil remains at many of the 404 sites, mostly under the surface.
But the plan says ``the state considers it neither technically
possible nor environmentally practical to remove all remaining
contamination.''
   In a news release, Gov. Steve Cowper said ``the state, Coast
Guard and Exxon have made substantial progress throughout the spill
area. Many areas are free of oil. However, there are limits to what
we can and should do.''
   It's somewhat misleading to say the sites have been cleaned,
Piper said. What the state is saying is that everything that can be
done has been done at the approved sites.
   ``There's no such thing as a successful oil-spill cleanup,'' he
said. ``If you get oil on a beach after a spill, you're not going
to get it all cleaned up.''
   The shore figures do not include Kodiak Island sites, which
could not be listed because of a computer programming problem. But
nearly all of the island's shores need no more treatment, Piper
said.
   Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik in Anchorage said the company was
reviewing the plan and would have no immediate comment. The company
will make no decision on next year's cleanup until a new shore
survey is completed next spring, he said.
   The nation's largest oil company has spent more than $2.2
billion on the cleanup and paid more than $240 million in claims to
those who suffered damages from the spill.

   Treasury chief John Major finished ahead of two
rivals but fell short of a necessary majority today in the race to
succeed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   A third and final ballot by the 372 Conservative Party members
of the House of Commons will be conducted Thursday.
   Major won 185 votes, two less than the simple majority required
for election. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131
votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes.
   Heseltine immediately announced that he would vote for Major on
Thursday, and Hurd also conceded that Major would win the race.
   Major, 47, and Heseltine, 57, had been considered the
front-runners heading into the second-round ballot.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who had withdrawn from the contest last week
following the first-round vote and had given her support to Major,
remains prime minister at least until Thursday night.
   Hurd said that the party rules required a third ballot, even
though he and Heseltine had conceded that Major would be the
winner.
   A week ago, voting in the same committee room at the House of
Commons, legislators forced the downfall of Mrs. Thatcher.
   She received more votes than Heseltine, 57, but failed to gain
the 15 percent margin required for an outright victory.
   Mrs. Thatcher withdrew from the balloting Thursday after party
leaders warned she would lose the second round.
   Major and Hurd immediately entered the race.
   Mrs. Thatcher says she will submit her resignation to Queen
Elizabeth II soon after her successor is chosen, ending 11{ years
in power.
   Lawmakers faced a dilemma in today's vote:
   Major, chancellor of the exchequer, has the most support in the
Cabinet and possibly the party in Parliament, but polls indicate
the flamboyant Heseltine is the most popular with voters and thus
the most likely to lead Conservatives to victory in the next
election, which must be held by mid-1992.
   Hurd, 60, hoped to squeeze through on Thursday as the consensus
second choice. His supporters argue that, as Britain's spokesman
throughout the Persian Gulf crisis, he is the best leader to carry
on Mrs. Thatcher's hawkish policy.
   Mrs. Thatcher, however, supported Major, the son of a circus
performer.
   ``She looks upon him as the true man of the people,'' said a
Thatcher aide.
   Major left school at 16, never went to college, worked as a
laborer and was on welfare before becoming a banker. He was elected
to Parliament in 1979, when Mrs. Thatcher came to power, and was in
the Cabinet four years later as treasury secretary.
   Mrs. Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary last year, then
chancellor.
   Opinion polls published after Mrs. Thatcher's downfall indicate
that the Oxford-educated Heseltine is the public's first choice as
prime minister, followed by Major.
   The polls also suggested that Mrs. Thatcher's departure has
restored her party's fortunes. After trailing the opposition Labor
Party for six months in polls, the latest soundings suggest the
Tories would run well ahead of Labor under Heseltine or Major. But
it was close with Hurd.
   Heseltine, who quit the Thatcher Cabinet in 1986, has portrayed
himself as a Thatcher-like character: the only one with the
determination to walk out instead of getting dropped; the one with
the guts to challenge her.
   ``I'm perhaps too similar to Mrs. Thatcher,'' he said in a
weekend television interview. ``In the end we're people you can
trust and who stand up and say what we think and stick to it.''
   The leadership contest which brought down Mrs. Thatcher, 65, was
precipitated b increasing divisions over her combative stance
toward the European Community.
   But her aides say the root causes were rising inflation and
unemployment, compounded by an unpopular new local government tax
and a growing army of enemies among sacked Cabinet ministers and
never-promoted legislators.
   Mrs. Thatcher appeared in good spirits at a farewell party
Monday night for her staff of 200 at 10 Downing Street.
   ``Life begins at 65 and I shall be working for the future,'' she
told them.
   ``She doesn't want to go out with a lot of backbiting,'' her
press secretary Bernard Ingham said Monday. ``It's a rough old
world, and I don't think she would have it any other way.''

   A shortage of milk is the latest consumer crisis
to strike the capital, which already has endured scarcities this
year of such staples as bread, sugar, cigarettes and potatoes.
   Under the scare headline, ``Even the Children of Moscow Might Be
Left Without Milk, If ...,'' Tuesday's editionsof Moskovsky
Komsomolets reported that the 18 regions shipping milk to Moscow
are sending fewer supplies.
   Since the beginning of 1990, Moscow has received 100,000 fewer
tons of milk, the newspaper said, without reporting the total. As a
result, production of processed cheese, cottage cheese and sour
cream have been cut.
   A clerk at a mostly barren supermarket in Moscow's Taganskaya
neighborhood confirmed the store was getting less milk, with daily
supplies that usually last until about 6 p.m. now running out by
noon. Scores of people were seen lining up at dairy stores Tuesday.
   Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin warned Russian
legislators Tuesday that food shortages have nearly overshadowed
all other issues.
   ``Delays in solving this problem threaten Russia's revival,''
Yeltsin said.
   Deputy Moscow Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich said Monday that nine
regions in Russia have announced that they were stopping deliveries
to the capital, pushing residents fearful of a hungry winter ``to
the edge of another crisis.''
   Stankevich also blamed the milk crisis on ``shopping sprees and
hoarding.'' Last week, several rush-hour shoppers riding Moscow's
subway were seen carrying four and five of the light-blue,
one-liter milk cartons apiece.
   Moscow and Leningrad, the Soviet Union's two biggest cities,
traditionally have been spared the shortages that have struck other
cities in previous years. They no longer are immune, however, as
nnterprises in various regions withhold supplies and keep them for
local consumption.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meeting Tuesday with
members of the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies, sharply
rebuked those republics and regions that have refused to supply the
cities of Moscow, Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk and others with grain and
other agricultural supplies.
   The Moscow Industrial Association ``Moloko'' - milk in Russian -
said that in the past, shortages were eased by supplies of powdered
milk. But, with 95 percent of the powdered milk obtained from
abroad, that ``luxury'' is no longer affordable, the newspaper
said.
   The authors of the story suggested that Moloko triple the price
of a liter of milk to one ruble, about $1.80, to avoid having to
use state subsidies. But the general director of Moloko is against
it. He told the newspaper that Moscow consumers ``may not
understand'' such an increase.
   Moskovsky Komsomolets said the regions supplying Moscow's milk
don't want rubles in payment; they want scarce goods in return for
their dairy products.
   ``But the association `Moloko' is not `Mitsubishi,''' the
newspaper added wryly, referring to the Japanese consumer goods
conglomerate.
   Rationing of goods such as vodka, pasta and rice is in effect in
many places in the Soviet Union as the economy has worsened.
   Leningrad will introduce food rationing as of Saturday. Although
Moscow already rations sugar and cigarettes and is considering such
a program for other goods, city officials do not believe it is a
solution, because the ration coupons would not necessarily
guarantee supplies.
   Some officials are proposing a special kind of ``Moscow money''
- for example, 50 rubles per month per resident - which would be
backed up with food products, the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda
reported. It did not provide further details on the plan.

<HEAD>New Government Formed As Longtime Prime Minister Steps Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goh Chok Tong formed a new government Tuesday
and prepared to replace the only prime minister Singapore has ever
known.
   Goh officially takes office Wednesday, and his new government
includes a prominent post for his predecdessor, Lee Kuan Yew.
   Lee had been prime minister since the former British crown
colony became a self-governing state in 1959.
   During 31 years of authoritarian rule, he helped transform the
former colonial outpost into a flourishing banking and commercial
center.
   The transition of power to his chosen successor has been in the
works for more than two years.
   The 67-year-old Lee is to be a senior minister without portfolio
attached to the prime minister's office, and is to continue as
secretary-general of the governing People's Action Party. His
eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong, 38, was recently appointed one of two
deputy prime ministers.
   In a ceremony on Tuesday at the Istana, or palace, President Wee
Kim Wee appointed Goh prime minister and asked him to form a
government. Goh then submitted the names of his Cabinet members to
the president.
   Goh's government is expected to push to amend the constitution
to provide for an elected president with an array of executive
powers. The post is now appointive and largely ceremonial.
   Because his party holds 80 of the 81 elected seats in
Parliament, the measure is likely to be approved and the
constitution amended by mid-January.
   Lee Kuan Yew suggested the changes in 1984, but he says he is
not interested in seeking the revamped presidency.
   Critics say having an executive head of state will virtually end
the country's British style of government, in which Parliament is
supreme, particularly if the president and prime minister are at
odds.
   Goh said the stronger presidency is needed as an additional
check on Parliament.
   The Guinness Book of World Records had listed Lee as the
longest-serving prime minister.
   ``I think that Singapore has seen and heard enough of me for 31
years,'' he said last week.
   When the Cambridge-educated lawyer took charge, this island city
state had no natural resources, no industry, bitter racial
divisions and potentially unfriendly neighbors.
   Lee helped forge an identity for his polyglot island of 2.7
million people, uniting an ethnic Chinese majority with sizable
Malay and Indian minorities.
   He demanded discipline to overcome hardships. Obedience, hard
work, cleanliness, thrift and the profit motive were applied as the
shabby British colonial outpost was transformed.
   Singapore is now a flourishing banking and commercial center
with high-tech industries, a first-class educational system and
glitzy shopping centers.
   Years of firm political leadership and stable economic growth
helped attract investment by multinational corporations seeking a
doorway to the booming markets of the Far East.

<HEAD>Appeals Court: Even New York State Can't Avoid Paying Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the taxman calls, everyone must answer
- even the state.
   The state's top court ruled Tuesday that state government is not
exempt from a law that requires taxpayers to pay their property tax
even while they're appealing the assessment.
   ``The state must pay its local property taxes when they are
due,'' Court of Appeals Judge Vito Titone wrote in the unanimous
decision.
   State officials launched the case on behalf of the Hudson
River-Black River Regulating District. In 1987, Fulton County
raised the state's tax bill for 380 pieces of property operated by
the district in Northampton from $234,000 to $440,000, according to
the attorney general's office.
   State lawyers argued that laws that protect New York state from
paying penalties for delinquent taxes and from tax foreclosure also
exempted it from paying taxes pending resolution of its appeal of
the assessment.
   But Titone argued that, if anything, the existence of those two
specific exemptions indicate lawmakers want the state to be treated
like any other taxpayer when it comes to an appeal.
   ``Indeed, the balance of equities may even tilt more heavily in
favor of local government's taxing power when the state is the
taxpayer, since the state is generally in a better position than an
individual taxpayer to absorb a temporary overpayment pending
judicial correction,'' Titone said.

   Goodbye pricey menus, long lines and goat
cheese. Hello bistros, broccoli and service with a smile.
   Today's gloomy economy is having a big impact on dining out -
but it's not all bad, according to the 1991 Zagat New York City
Restaurant Survey.
   ``Consumers are demanding, and getting, more for their money now
- even on tighter budgets and stricter expense accounts - than they
did a few years ago,'' said Tim Zagat, publisher and editor of the
pocket-sized guide, which arrives at bookstores this week.
   Restaurateurs are holding down prices, throwing in more extras -
like free appetizers and larger portions - and working harder to
keep customers happy, he says.
   According to Zagat Survey, which publishes the restaurant guide,
the number of restaurant closings rose from 38 in 1989 to 54 in
1990. But the number of openings held at 125.
   The new eateries generally have a casual atmosphere, lower
prices and simple food, such as scaled-down bistro, regional
American or pasta fare, according to the survey.
   Hubert's, a fancy Upper East Side restaurant, was among the
recent closings. It tried to change with the times, shedding its
luxury image and slashing its prices to $100 for a dinner for two.
But along the way the establishment ``lost direction,'' according
to the guide.
   Diners ``may be less willing to support certain kinds of
marginal or expense account hangouts,'' Zagat said, ``but they're
still trying out new places in great numbers and are proving
especially supportive of smaller neighborhood places with moderate
prices and simpler food.''
   A total of 5,500 volunteer diners participated in the 1991 Zagat
Survey, which reviewed the decor, food and service at 1,012
restaurants citywide. To accommodate the shift to dollarwise
dining, the guide for the first time includes a ``Bang for the
Buck'' index of 100 good-value restaurants.
   ``It costs more to get a full tank of gas than to get a good
meal out in New York,'' Zagat said.
   Still, New York City's high-priced restaurants are the highest
by far in the country. According to the survey, the average price
for dinner at the city's 20 most expensive restaurants is $67.07.
   In Washington, the average is $50.23; Los Angeles $48.22; San
Francisco $48.08; Baltimore $38.30; Atlanta $37.44; New Orleans
$34.64; Seattle $33.95; St. Louis $33.23; and Kansas City $25.23.
   At the top end of the scale in New York, the survey notes, there
are still tremendously successful establishments. The Four Seasons,
where dinner averages $64, and Lutece, where dinner averages $71,
are rated as the most popular.
   Bouley, which opened less than two months before the October
1987 stock market crash, was rated as having the best food in the
city. The nine-course tasting menu at the flower-filled French
restaurant is $65.
   ``It proves that Cinderella stories are still possible among New
York restaurants and that put to the wall, some places are
performing at the peak of their game,'' Zagat said.

<TEXT>
   The 1991 Spoleto Festival U.S.A. will
include an 80th birthday gala for Gian Carlo Menotti and feature
the composer conducting one of his own operas.
   Only last month Menotti was offering to resign as artistic
director of the festival he brought to Charleston in 1977. He later
agreed to continue under his current contract for two more seasons,
and his dispute with the festival's board appears resolved.
   ``It would be entirely inappropriate to have a birthday party at
which the honoree didn't come,'' said Ross Markwardt, the chairman
of the Spoleto board.
   Menotti was in Scotland and did not attend Monday's news
conference announcing the schedule. However, Menotti generally has
not attended program announcements.
   Markwardt said the dispute hasn't affected fund raising for the
$5.7 million festival. ``We find no evidence the artistic content
of this festival has been compromised,'' he said.
   The festival, which runs from May 23 through June 9 will include
three operas, including Menotti directing his ``Maria Golovin.''
   ``It is one of his favorite operas and one he thinks has been
unfairly neglected,'' said Nigel Redden, festival general manager.
   A preview on May 23 will be followed by a reception honoring
Menotti's birthday. The schedule also includes a birthday concert
for Menotti featuring cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich.
Menotti turns 80 July 7.
   Other operas at next year's festival include ``Tales of
Hoffmann'' and Monteverdi's ``The Coronation of Poppea.''
   The National Ballet of Spain and the Rambert Dance Company from
England will lend an international feeling to next year's festival.
   The dance program includes ``The Festival of Indonesia in
Performance.'' The troupe includes dancers and a 20-piece
percussion orchestra.
   Dance premieres at Spoleto include works by the Elizabeth Streb
Ringside company and Blondell Cummings.
   Three young Italian dance companies will make their American
debuts. They include Compagnia Efesto, Paco Decina and Sosta
Palmizi.
   Choreographer David Gordon will present a new work, ``The
Mysteries and What's So Funny,'' featuring music by Philip Glass.
   Redden said the visual arts program, an apparent source of the
dispute between Menotti and the board, will be announced in
January.
   The festival has budgeted a record $800,000 for visual arts, and
at Menotti's direction will be taking risks by trying new forms,
Markwardt said.
   The exhibits are expected to include large works throughout this
historic port city, and possibly decorating facades of buildings.
   The schedule for the jazz and theater offerings will be
announced later, Redden said.

<HEAD>Poland To Strengthen Troop Levels On Soviet Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's defense minister said Tuesday he
is worried about the Soviet Union's stability and plans to
strengthen Polish troop levels along the two nations' frontier.
   Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said Poland's troop levels
have been reduced by 100,000 to 350,000 over the last three years
and that he expects a further reduction of another 100,000.
   He said about 40 percent of its armed forces now are along the
German border and 20 percent on the Soviet frontier.
   Kolodziejczyk said those troops will be redistributed, with
one-third along the Soviet border, a third along the German border
and the remainder in the Polish interior.
   He said the troops are being moved because of lessened East-West
tensions and because of worries about the Soviet Union's stability.
   ``Even if the situation in the East (Soviet Union) were stable,
the troops would have to be distributed in a different way,''
Kolodziejczyk said. ``But the situation is not stable, which is a
source of great concern for the Polish government.''
   Kolodziejczyk spoke with reporters after meeting with German
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.
   The Soviet Union is expected to have an unusually harsh winter
this year. There is serious concern that will touch off famine in a
crumbling empire already beset by other problems and cause an
exodus of hungry Soviets.
   There also has been concern about civil unrest.
   Germany has begun a huge emergency program to help out the
Soviet Union during the winter months.
   The German branch of the Catholic relief organization, Caritas,
said Tuesday it will begin sending 30,000 food packages to the
Soviet Union this weekend.
   German television said further aid might be airlifted into the
Soviet Union.
   A high-level team of economic, agricultural and transport
officials from Germany, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top foreign
policy adviser, traveled to Moscow on Tuesday to talk with Soviet
officials about organizing emergency assistance.
   Kohl has stressed in recent days the importance of helping out
the Soviet Union and ensuring that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev can survive the growing economic and political problems
facing his nation.
   After his talks with Stoltenberg, Kolodziejczyk also said Poland
is interested in acquiring armaments once owned by East Germany and
now in the possession of united Germany's armed forces.
   Through unification, Stoltenberg's ministry has inherited from
the East Germans, among other things, Soviet-made MiG-29 aircraft,
rated as among the world's best fighter planes.

Associated Press Writer&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The National Organization for Women called on
Tuesday for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the
Persian Gulf, saying the ``oppressive regimes of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait are not worth the sacrifice of American lives.''
   The organization, in its first public stand on the Gulf crisis,
condemned Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for human rights violations
against women and protested the treatment of American servicewomen
in the region.
   ``Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are despotic, clan-run monarchies,''
said NOW President Molly Yard. ``Both ... systematically oppress
woman. This is gender apartheid in its purest, most brutal form,
and should deeply offend all Americans.''
   Yard also objected to the restrictions imposed on military women
serving in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We would be outraged if the administration sent American
troops to defend South Africa from invasion, ordering black
soldiers to `respect the culture' by bowing their heads in the
presence of white racists,'' she said at a press conference on the
NOW resolution.
   NOW complained female soldiers in Saudi Arabia must dress in
full fatigues while male soldiers are allowed to sport T-shirts in
the desert heat. Military women are not allowed to drive while
off-duty or run errands unescorted and must wear knee-length shorts
while swimming - even in private pools.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, a senior member of the Armed Services
Committee, agreed that the U.S. applies double standards toward
Saudi Arabia.
   ``We do not tolerate `cultural differences' as an excuse for
racial violence,'' said Schroeder, D-Colo. ``Why do we tolerate it
for women? Our young women are being put out there to defend the
country and are also being told that in off hours they must comply
with apartheid in that country vis-a-vis women.''
   Yard stressed that NOW opposes Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but
says economic sanctions should be given more time to work and that
a diplomatic solution should be reached through the United Nations.
   ``Everything President Bush is doing leads to war and we are
opposed to that,'' said Yard, adding that the military build-up in
the Gulf ``is designed to protect U.S. oil interests.''
   NOW plans to picket the Saudi Embassy in Washington next week
and will petition the U.N. to condemn the human rights violations
by the Saudi government against women.

<HEAD>Report: Unidentified Murder Victim Might Be Missing Heiress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney's office is considering
exhuming the unidentified body of a murder victim to see if it is
that of missing candy heiress Helen Brach, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   For the past six months, federal agents and Illinois State
Police detectives have been trying to gather evidence that might
connect the body with Brach's disappearance, according to the
Chicago Tribune.
   Hampering the investigation is the fact that the dead woman
found in the woods in Calumet City in 1978 was missing her hands
and part of her face, including her teeth, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified sources.
   That has made it impossible to compare Brach's dental records to
those of the body.
   Investigators hope to exhume the body and conduct a series of
tests, including comparison of Brach's X-rays with those of the
woman, sources told the newspaper Monday.
   Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, disappeared after
checking out of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., on Feb. 17,
1977. She was then 65 years old.
   The new interest in the body stems from a federal investigation
here into a number of horse traders suspected of defrauding wealthy
individuals who purchased horses, the Tribune said.
   One theory is that Brach was murdered after she repeatedly
complained to authorities that she was defrauded in the purchase of
horses, the newspaper said.
   At the time of her disappearance, her net worth was estimated at
$17 million. The value of her estate has increased to more than $50
million. Most of her estate has gone to a charitable trust called
the Helen Brach Foundation.

   Forty-three deer were shot and killed in
the past two months in an effort to keep the animals off the
runways at Orlando International Airport, authorities say.
   Three commercial airliners have hit free roaming deer this fall,
but there have been no injuries to people or damage to the planes.
   The airport hired a consultant in early October to trap and move
deer because the animals were a hazard when they wandered onto
runways from nearby woods. But when a Delta jet struck a deer on
takeoff Oct. 7, the consultant was paid $100 a deer to kill the
animals.
   On Oct. 26, a Midway Airlines jet struck a deer while taking
off. It completed its flight to Chicago without problems. A
Northwest Airlines plane struck a deer Nov. 16, again without major
damage.
   Animal rights activists have protested the killings.
   Sue Santoro, president of Voices for Animals of Central Florida,
said she discussed the problem with airport officials before the
Delta accident and met with them Oct. 17 and was assured that no
more deer would be shot.
   Bill Jennings, the airport's director of operations, however,
denied that he told her deer wouldn't be shot.
   ``The safety of the traveling public is of our utmost concern,''
Jennings said Monday. ``I've always tried to get people to
understand shooting the deer - lethal means - will remain an option
that we have. It's not something we want to do, but we will not
abandon that.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush today said the United
States and Mexico are ``one family,'' united in their goal to break
down trade barriers and in their opposition to Iraq's aggression in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``The size and sophistication of U.S.-Mexico trade today only
hints at our potential. We can create and share unprecedented
prosperity and jobs,'' Bush said in a speech at the Monterrey City
Theater, referring to the free trade pact that both governments
want to accomplish.
   Bush, in a later luncheon toast, said the trade agreement that
could be concluded as early as 1992 would ``unleash powerful
energies in both economies.'' He said: ``No country is more
important to the United States than Mexico.''
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, joining Bush in
speaking at the Monterrey City Theater, emphasized that Mexican
migrant workers make a positive contribution to the U.S. economy
and the United States has a ``moral and juridical obligation'' to
respect their human and labor rights.
   Bush, on the second-day of an overnight visit, also called for
resuscitation of the faltering international trade talks known as
the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   He said ``the critical moment is at hand'' for the talks, which
resume next week and are aimed at easing worldwide trade barriers.
Negotiators have stumbled over European reluctance to give up
agricultural subsidies.
   ``We must not let the Uruguay Round fail,'' Bush said.
   Bush praised Mexico's cooperation in the U.S.-led opposition to
Iraq, and its stepped-up oil production that has helped cover the
loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait due to a United Nations-imposed
embargo.
   ``Mexico and the United States stand united in rejecting
aggression,'' Bush said. ``The world of global conflict is giving
way to a new world order of global cooperation.''
   Stating that Mexico has contributed to the U.S. cultural,
language and architectural heritage, Bush said, ``Somos una
familia; we are one family.''
   When he arrived in Monterrey on Monday night, Bush told tens of
thousands of people at an outdoor rally that he had come to Mexico,
`` with a message of respect, of admiration and hope for a brighter
future shared by our two countries.''
   `Viva Mexico,'' Bush shouted before he and his wife viewed an
elaborate fireworks demonstration from a glassed-in stage on the
plaza.
   Bush's two-day trip focused primarily on the two countries'
efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement.
   This morning the president met with a group of U.S. and Mexican
business leaders. Later he met for a second straight day with
Salinas before they addressed the Monterrey City Theater audience.
Bush's schedule also called for a meeting with another group of
Mexican and U.S. businessmen and more bilateral talks on issues
such as drugs, the environment and economic matters.
   Bush today refused to answer reporters' questions at a photo
session with Salinas on the latest developments in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The Mexican president, however, said in remarks prepared for his
speech that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait provides new opportunity for
international cooperation.
   ``A renewed international community enables us to maintain the
hope that international law will prevail over the invasion and over
capricious and arbitrary actions,'' he said, repeating Mexico's
support for the United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
   Salinas also made clear that he expects the United States to
ensure better treatment of Mexicans who migrate across the border.
   ``There is always a moral and juridical obligation to strive for
a real respect for the human and labor rights of these immigrants
and their families, whose work unquestionably makes a positive
contribution to the development of the United States economy,''
Salinas said in reference to the concerns in Mexico about racism
and violence against Mexicans along the U.S. side of the border.
   He said, ``every single violation of their physical and moral
integrity, on either side of the border, is an affront to the
values in which both of our nations believe.''
   Bush heralded the goal of reaching a free trade agreement with
Mexico even as Salinas sounded a cautionary note, citing Mexican
worries about what they see as U.S. protectionist sentiments.
   Both Salinas and Bush say they want the trade agreement to go
forward. But Salinas complained in an El Norte newspaper interview
published Monday that ``American products can enter the Mexican
market without restriction. But ours are detained at customs, and
there are always many restrictions.''
   Mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the
United States for not meeting quality standards.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the presidents
Monday underscored their commitment to opening up the trading
relationship.
   They ``are interested in pursuing the agreement as fast as
possible and attach high priority to its successful conclusion,''
the spokesman said.
   If Congress approves Bush's request to begin formal negotiations
early next year, a free trade pact could be concluded some time in
early 1992, administration officials have said.
   Potential sticking points in negotiations might include Mexico's
insistence that its oil industry be kept free of foreign
investment.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told reporters that problem
has been eased by Mexico's agreement to allow an Export-Import bank
loan for drilling and supplying equipment in Mexican oil
production. However, that does not extend to allowing U.S. equity
in Mexican oil interests, and the United States at this point will
not insist on that, Brady said.
   Brady and other U.S. officials, briefing reporters on Bush's
talks with Salinas, said environmental and Central American topics
were covered as well.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly
said the two countries agreed to a study over the next 18 months of
environmental problems along the border, particularly pollution and
hazardous waste from industry on the Mexican side of the border.
   The two presidents ``agreed there is a real need for a
breakthrough'' in El Salvador where Marxist rebels continue to
battle the government, said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   He said Bush and Salinas urged a cease-fire there and agreed to
push for a greater role by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar in achieving that.
   Bush began his visit to this industrial center by attending a
small rodeo and dancing demonstration in Salinas' hometown of
Agualeguas. The presidents then flew by helicopter to nearby
Monterrey.
   Their motorcade was showered with a thick rain of confetti
thrown from tall buildings. People mobbed Bush when he got out to
briefly shake hands, as first lady Barbara Bush stayed in the car.

<SECOND>`Recession is Here,' Business Economists Say</SECOND>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three out of four of the nation's top business
economists believe the United States has skidded into a recession,
in part because of the rapid rise in oil prices following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Recession is here,'' the National Association of Business
Economists said Tuesday in a report on its canvass of 51
professional forecasters.
   The report reflects a sharp jump in pessimism among the
economists, who just three months ago still felt the country could
avoid an imminent downturn.
   ``We think that the recession began in the fourth quarter and
that the (Persian Gulf) oil-price shock played a major role in
ending the expansion,'' Richard D. Rippe, NABE president and chief
economist with Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., told a news conference.
   ``In our view the economy was on a slow-growth track prior to
the invasion of Kuwait'' Aug. 2, Rippe said. ``That slow-growth
track has been converted into a mild recession outlook by the
oil-price shock that has developed.''
   In a survey following the Iraqi invasion, only 45 percent of the
forecasters said a recession either had begun or was imminent. Just
a year ago, 62 percent of the forecasters predicted the economy
would escape a recession through 1992.
   Two other reports Tuesday provided further gloomy news about the
economy:
   -The Commerce Department reported the U.S. trade deficit jumped
28.9 percent in the July-September quarter, to $29.75 billion, the
highest imbalance in a year.
   Imports rose 5 percent to a record $125.91 billion, as the
Persian Gulf crisis drove up the cost of oil. Exports, damped by
falling overseas demand for American farm products, fell 0.6
percent to $96.16 billion.
   -The National Association of Realtors said October sales of
existing homes fell 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.02 million, the lowest rate since February 1985, when it
was 2.95 million.
   Realtors' president Harley E. Rouda said reports of persistent
budget deficit woes, economic sluggishness nationwide and the
threat of war have created psychological barriers that are blocking
home sales.
   Despite the gloomy news, Rippe, the president of the business
economists, said any recession ``should be shallow by historical
standards.'' The median estimate of the forecasters is for economic
growth to decline 1.0 percent in
   this quarter and 0.8 percent in the next.

quarters or less, 29 percent said it would continue for three
quarters. Four percent said it would continue for 12 months. None
felt it would last beyond a year.
   The last recession continued 16 months, from July 1981 to
November 1982.
   Another survey this month of prominent economists, by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators, found 80 percent of the 52 participants said a
recession would begin before year's end. An additional five percent
said it would begin in 1991.
   Assuming two quarterly declines - the informal definition of a
recession - the NABE economists projected the economy will grow 1.0
percent in 1990 and 0.5 percent in 1991. That includes growth of
0.6 percent in the second quarter next year, 2.0 percent in the
third and 2.5 percent in the fourth. The economy grew 2.5 percent
in 1989 and 4.5 percent in 1988.
   Rippe said ``one key assumption in our economic outlook'' is the
prospect that oil prices will fall and ``diminish the tax on the
economy ... and help reduce the rate of inflation.''
   Indeed, the panelists projected inflation will drop nearly two
percentage points on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis -
from 6.4 percent in 1990 to 4.5 percent in 1991.
   The survey also found the forecasters believe unemployment will
rise from 5.5 percent this year to 6.1 percent in 1991. The jobless
rate in October was 5.7 percent, up from 5.2 percent in June.

<TEXT>
   Three out of four of the nation's top business
economists believe the United States has skidded into a recession,
in part because of the rapid rise in oil prices following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Recession is here,'' the National Association of Business
Economists said Tuesday in a report on its canvass of 51
professional forecasters.
   The report reflects a sharp jump in pessimism among the
economists, who just three months ago still felt the country could
avoid an imminent downturn.
   ``We think that the recession began in the fourth quarter and
that the (Persian Gulf) oil-price shock played a major role in
ending the expansion,'' Richard D. Rippe, NABE president and chief
economist with Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., told a news conference.
   ``In our view the economy was on a slow-growth track prior to
the invasion of Kuwait'' Aug. 2, Rippe said. ``That slow-growth
track has been converted into a mild recession outlook by the
oil-price shock that has developed.''
   In a survey following the Iraqi invasion, only 45 percent of the
forecasters said a recession either had begun or was imminent. Just
a year ago, 62 percent of the forecasters predicted the economy
would escape a recession through 1992.
   Two other reports Tuesday provided further gloomy news about the
economy:
   -The Commerce Department reported the U.S. trade deficit jumped
28.9 percent in the July-September quarter, to $29.75 billion, the
highest imbalance in a year.
   Imports rose 5 percent to a record $125.91 billion, as the
Persian Gulf crisis drove up the cost of oil. Exports, damped by
falling overseas demand for American farm products, fell 0.6
percent to $96.16 billion.
   -The National Association of Realtors said October sales of
existing homes fell 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.02 million, the lowest rate since February 1985, when it
was 2.95 million.
   Realtors' president Harley E. Rouda said reports of persistent

<TEXT>
   John Major, the youngest and fastest-rising
British prime minister of the 20th century, epitomizes the virtues
of self-reliance and initiative preached by his predecessor.
   Major described himself as a Thatcherite but insisted he was his
own man.
   ``I am not running as `Son of Margaret Thatcher.' I am running
as myself, with my own priorities and my own program,'' Major said
over the weekend.
   He reaches the highest office in the land 11 years after
entering Parliament, without leaving a trail of bruised and
resentful enemies. And he came all the way up from poverty without
so much as a university education.
   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine mounted the
successful challenge to Mrs. Thatcher in the Conservative Party
that caused the prime minister to abandon her office. But Mrs.
Thatcher endorsed Major to succeed her and in the three-way fight
for the party leadership and the prime ministership, it was Major
who had the votes to defeat Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd. Softspoken, bespectacled and often referred to as ``the gray
man,'' 47-year-old Major has none of the obvious qualities
associated with the political high-flyer.
   But Mrs. Thatcher saw in him a sharp mind, political judgment
and the conciliator's talent for negotiation.
   She saw him as ``a man of the people,'' her aides said, and even
his opponents say he's a nice man.
   He appeals to the right wing of his party with free market
economic views, and to the left wing with his sympathetic outlook
toward Britain's underprivileged.
   Even for the new breed of Conservative who broke into the ranks
of Oxford and Cambridge-educated Tory privilege, Major has an
unusual background.
   The son of a sometime circus performer and actor, he left school
at 16, worked as a laborer and spent eight months on welfare before
he started his successful banking career as a clerk at age 18.
   Tall and deliberate, Major has neat gray hair, clean-cut
features and a quiet manner of speech nearly free of the
inflections of class and geography that still pigeonhole so many
Britons.
   He sees increased social mobility as ``one of the greatest
achievements of the last 10 years,'' and says his goal is ``a
genuinely classless society in which people can rise to whatever
level that their own abilities and their own good fortune may take
them.''
   The contribution of blue-collar workers should be respected, he
says.
   ``We will need the practical manual skills of people in the
future and we should recognize those for what they are - a very
genuine talent.''
   Once asked if regretted not having gone to university, he said
``not a bit.''
   ``It has been of immense value to me to have been on the other
side of the fence and to know what it was like to face a few
difficulties, and I don't regret any of that.''
   Besides the broad electoral appeal of his background, Major's
greatest practical asset is his financial experience as a banker,
chief secretary to the Treasury and lately as chancellor of the
exchequer during a difficult year for the economy.
   Major climbed swiftly through Standard and Chartered Bank, where
he was an executive for 14 years before entering national politics.
   His lack of expertise in foreign affairs is regarded as a
weakness - he spent only three months as foreign secretary - but he
has indicated the veteran Hurd would stay on to head the Foreign
Office.
   Major's stance on the Persian Gulf crisis is unlikely to differ
greatly from Mrs. Thatcher's. On Europe, he says he is convinced
Britain will be able negotiate an outcome on political and monetary
union that will be acceptable to the European Community and to
Parliament.
   Elected to Parliament in 1979, he entered the Cabinet in 1987 as
chief secretary to the Treasury. From July to October 1989 he was
foreign secretary, and when Nigel Lawson resigned as chancellor of
the exchequer in October, Major replaced him as the nation's top
treasury official.
   Major started life in the comfortable suburb of Cheam and went
to Rutlish Grammar, a state school for bright children.
   When he was 11 the family, including two brothers and a sister,
moved to the tough south London neighborhood of Brixton following
``an injudicious investment'' by his father.
   He speaks with affection of his father, who was 66 when John was
born and soon began losing his eyesight.
   ``I used to walk with him a lot so he wouldn't trip over curbs
and what have you,'' Major once said. ``He was a wonderful talker.
... I still think he was the finest raconteur I have ever heard. He
had such a wealth of experience and a range of interests.''
   The family lived in a cramped apartment, cooked on a gas burner
on the landing and shared a bathroom in the hall with other
tenants.
   The home was five minutes from the Oval, one of the hallowed
sporting grounds of England, where Major acquired a lifelong
devotion to the game of cricket.
   He can no longer play, however. During a posting in Nigeria with
the bank his left leg was so badly injured in a car crash that he
nearly lost it.
   ``My leg doesn't permit me to run,'' he said. ``If I bend it I'm
likely to go base over apex.''
   Major married Norma Johnson in 1970 and they have a daughter
Elizabeth, 19, and a son James, 15. Mrs. Major, an opera-lover, is
the author of a biography of the singer Joan Sutherland.
   An expert cook and dressmaker, she likes a quiet family life.
   ``I am very fulfilled by domesticity and I don't feel ashamed or
guilty about that,'' she says.
   The post of chancellor carries with it the prize of 11 Downing
St., the house next door to the prime minister, but it was never
home to the Majors. Mrs. Major stayed home in Great Stukeley with
the children and her husband came home on weekends.

   John Major was elected today as leader of the
Conservative Party and will succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime
minister.
   Major, whose candidacy was endorsed by Mrs. Thatcher, fell two
votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded
defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.
   Aides said Mrs. Thatcher was ``thrilled.'' Major, 47, her
Treasury chief, is the youngest person to be elected prime minister
since the 19th century.
   ``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the
Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow
one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever
had,'' Major said.
   He called Mrs. Thatcher ``a very great prime minister indeed.''
   ``Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite
totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general
election,'' said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at
11 Downing St.
   Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine
had 131 votes, and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a
secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
   ``I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class
campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays
the basis for the unity of our party,'' Heseltine said moments
after the vote was announced.
   Hurd also quickly conceded. He said the party needed to unite,
and ``John Major is the right leader for this task.''
   Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative
Party committee that supervised the election, announced that a
third ballot was not required and Major was elected.
   Mrs. Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing St. to
congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the exchequer is her
next-door neighbor at No. 11.
   Mrs. Thatcher intended to submit her resignation to Queen
Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace once a new leader was elected.
Major would then be called to be confirmed as prime minister and
first lord of the treasury.
   Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign
secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.
   He moved up quickly in a five-day campaign for the leadership
after Mrs. Thatcher announced Thursday that she would resign rather
than continue a leadership fight against Heseltine.
   By the weekend, opinion polls showed that Major was nearly as
highly regarded by the public as was Heseltine, who has been
prominent for a decade.
   Major attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing
of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major's
own views were more liberal than many supposed.
   He described himself as conservative on economic issues but
liberal on social issues.
   Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever who
Mrs. Thatcher encouraged. Born March 29, 1943, he was the son of a
circus performer, left school at 16 and was a laborer and at one
time a welfare recipient.
   Major became a banker and Conservative Party activist, and was
elected to Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979. He was
appointed to a junior ministerial post in 1985, then to the No. 2
position in the Treasury in 1987.
   He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Mrs. Thatcher
appointed him foreign secretary in July 1989, and then chancellor
of the exchequer three months later.
   He inherits a party and a government that have been torn by
controversy over European policy and local taxes, and depressed
after months lagging behind the opposition Labor Party in opinion
polls.
   The government has until mid-1992 to call an election. Recent
opinion polls, however, suggested that any new leader would greatly
enhance Tory popularity, and Major was rated as favorably as
Heseltine.
   Major has indicated he would review the widely hated ``poll
tax,'' which replaced the property tax with a flat charge against
all adults, no matter how wealthy.
   He entered the leadership race jointly with Hurd, whose position
as foreign secretary appears secure.
   Tall and deliberate, Major has neat gray hair, clean-cut
features and a quiet manner of speech nearly free of the
inflections of class and geography that still pigeonhole so many
Britons.
   He sees increased social mobility as ``one of the greatest
achievements of the last 10 years,'' and says his goal is ``a
genuinely classless society in which people can rise to whatever
level that their own abilities and their own good fortune may take
them.''
   Once asked if regretted not having gone to university, he said
``not a bit.''
   ``It has been of immense value to me to have been on the other
side of the fence and to know what it was like to face a few
difficulties, and I don't regret any of that.''
   Major and his wife Norma have a daughter, Elizabeth, 19, and a
son, James, 15.

   Fading consumer confidence continued to take
its toll on sales of existing homes in October, pushing them down
4.7 percent to their lowest level in nearly six years, a real
estate trade group said Tuesday.
   Reports of persistent federal budget deficits, general economic
sluggishness and the threat of a Mideast war have created
psychological barriers that are blocking home purchases, according
to Harley E. Rouda, president of the National Association of
Realtors.
   As a result, the Realtors said, house resales fell to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.02 million, down from 3.17
million in September and the lowest rate since 2.95 million in
February 1985.
   The Commerce Department will report on new home sales in October
next Tuesday. In September, sales slumped 6 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 503,000, the biggest drop in six months.
   The Realtors said the median price of an existing house also
fell in October, down 1.7 percent to $92,800. The median means half
of the homes cost more, half less.
   Rouda said the monthly decline and a ``marginal'' 0.4 percent
increase over October 1989 prices mean that sellers are adjusting
their prices to fit a buyers' market.
   At the same time, the Realtors said mortgage interest rates
remained relatively stable.
   Rouda said the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported the
average rate for a 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgage ranged
from 10.08 percent to 10.17 percent in October. Rates subsequently
fell to an average of 9.93 percent by the end of last week.
   Each region of the country reported declines in sales and all
but the West posted lower median prices.
   The resale pace in the Northeast was 470,000 units, 9.6 percent
below the September rate. The median price was $136,200, down 0.7
percent from the previous month.
   Sales in the West totaled 490,000 in October, down 5.8 percent
from the previous month. The median price there was $140,600, 4.4
percent higher than in September.
   Sales in the Midwest were off 5.7 percent, to an annual rate of
820,000 units, while the median price fell 2.8 percent to $72,100.
   In the South, sales totaled 1.23 million, down 2.4 percent from
September. The median price dropped 2.9 percent, to $83,400.
   The Realtors said sales of existing homes are expected to total
3.33 million units this year, down 4.1 percent from 1989's 3.44
million total.

   Students serenaded Barbara Bush with a
Spanish version of ``America the Beautiful'' during her tour
Tuesday of a local school and community center.
   Mrs. Bush visited a DIF center, one of a network in Mexico under
the patronage of first lady Cecilia Occelli de Salinas that
includes adult education, handicraft training to make items for
home sale, a garden and a food kitchen for the elderly.
   A children's orchestra began playing ``The Yellow Rose of
Texas'' as Mrs. Bush passed through the school. ``Oh, oh, there's
my song,'' she exclaimed. ``They're playing my song.''
   Mrs. Salinas hosted the event. Also on hand were Diana

Negroponte; Nickie Bennett, wife of Monterrey's U.S. Consul General
John Bennett; Alma Rizzo, wife of Monterrey Mayor Socrates Rizzo,
and Cristina Trevino, wife of Nuevo Leon Gov. Jorge Trevino.
   Mrs. Bush wore a light blue silk suit with thin horizontal white
stripes and her trademark pearls while Mrs. Salinas wore a teal and
black linen dress.
   Mrs. Bush was presented with a basket of handicrafts made at the
training
   center by 9-year-old Jesus Eduardo Gonzalez Jimenez, who
admitted beforehand that he did not know who she was.
   At the nearby school she was serenaded by students singing
``America the Beautiful,'' ``Cielito Lindo,'' and ``La Bamba.'' She
also was given medals and a heart-shaped pecan arrangment with her
picture in the middle.

   Kodansha Ltd. said Reischauer's Belmont home probably will be

   Reischauer, who died in September, served as ambassador to Japan

Harvard, where he spent a long teaching career, and was considered
the dean of Japanese studies in the United States.
   Reischauer had worked for Kodansha, publishing some of his books

<TEXT>
   President Bush told Mexican business
officials Tuesday that a slowing U.S. economy might prompt
resistance to a free-trade deal with Mexico. But he vowed to
``write a new page in North American history,'' even if it meant
vetoing protectionist bills.
   Bush wrapped up a two-day state visit to this northern Mexican
industrial city with new agreements on oil investment and on
educational exchanges.
   He joined with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in
voicing strong support for a pact to end trade barriers between the
two nations by 1992, but conceded it could face some trouble in
Congress.
   ``This agreement will unleash powerful energies in both
economies,'' Bush said in a toast at a state luncheon. ``We're not
on an easy path, but I believe we're on the right one.''
   The president also praised Mexico for its strong support of the
U.S.-led effort against Iraq in the Persian Gulf and for increasing
its production of oil to help offset losses from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Salinas has also hinted he would send troops to Saudi Arabia to
join U.S. forces if the U.N. Security Council approves a
use-of-force resolution. However, U.S. officials said that the
crisis in the Middle East was not discussed in any detail by the
two leaders.
   Meanwhile, the two presidents appeared to reach an understanding
in a U.S.-Mexican disagreement over whether Mexico's vast oil
industry should be open to U.S. or other foreign investment.
Salinas has insisted the state-run and subsidized oil industry be
exempt from the free-trade talks.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told reporters here that
the dispute has been eased by Mexico's agreement to allow an
Export-Import Bank loan for drilling and supplying equipment in
Mexican oil exploration.
   Under such an arangement, U.S. companies could provide Mexico
with expertise in finding oil. The Export-Import Bank is an
independent U.S. government agency.
   Brady said the agreement still will not permit U.S. companies to
own direct interests in Mexican oil. But he said the United States
at this point will not press for that.
   Bush held a breakfast meeting with a group of Mexican and
American business leaders, then met for the second day with Salinas
and aides. Afterwards, the two leaders addressed a theater audience
of Monterrey citizens and Bush met with about 100 Mexican business
leaders.
   It was at this session, during a question and answer period,
that Bush was asked about protectionism in the United States, which
many Mexicans view as a threat to the free-trade agreement.
   ``As the giant U.S. economy slows down - it may slow down even
more - it concerns me that some in our country and some in our
Congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a
protectionist mode,'' Bush said.
   Bush said that if U.S. business want to export ``we better not
be protectionists.''
   ``We're going to have problems with certain elements'' in
winning support for the trade pact, which would be similar to the
one the United States and Canada signed in 1988, he said.
   ``It is a concern. It is not an overwhelming concern. I think it
is something that can be managed,'' he said.
   Bush told the business leaders that he had recently vetoed a
textile import quota bill that he said was the epitome of
protectionism. ``And this president will continue to veto
protectionist legislation,'' he added.
   ``The size and sophistication of U.S.-Mexico trade today only
hints at our potential. We can create and share unprecedented
prosperity and jobs,'' Bush said earlier in his address to citizens
in the Monterrey City Theater.
   ``I look forward to the day when we will meet to sign our names
to a free trade agreement that will write a new page in North
American history,'' he added.
   For his part, Salinas used the speech in the theater to
criticize the brutal treatment he said some Mexican workers are
receiving as they cross the U.S. border to find jobs in the United
States.
   He said Mexican workers make a positive contribution to the U.S.
economy and the United States has a ``moral and juridical
obligation'' to respect their human and labor rights.
   Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, said the free trade pact
would help Mexicans find jobs in their own country instead having
to cross the border to find work.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly,
briefing reporters here, said Mexico and the United States agreed
to a study over the next 18 months of environmental problems along
the border. He said it would pay special attention to hazardous
wastes from industry on the Mexican side of the border.
   The two presidents ``agreed there is a real need for a
breakthrough'' in El Salvador where Marxist rebels continue to
battle the government, said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   He said Bush and Salinas urged a cease-fire there and agreed to
push for a greater role by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar in achieving that.
   Bush and Salinas concluded their meeting by announcing a
$3-million annual program under which 150 Mexican and American
students a year will receive scholarships to pursue post-graduate
studies each other's countries.
   The program, to be based in Mexico City, will be jointly
financed by both countries.

   A procedure that freezes cancerous tumors by
using ultrasound-guided probes offers hope to people who otherwise
would be certain to die of liver malignancies, a radiologist said
Tuesday.
   Of 30 patients who underwent the treatment, six are free of
disease, said Dr. Gary Onik of Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   The technique, called cryosurgery, has the ability to destroy
tumors next to major blood vessels without destroying normal
tissues nearby, Onik reported at the 76th Scientific Assembly and
Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.
   It offers hope to patients whose cancer is caught before it
involves the entire liver, he said, noting that radiation and
chemotherapy are ineffective treatments for liver cancer.
   ``Everybody we worked on by definition couldn't be helped any
other way,'' Onik said.
   The patients who are now disease-free after undergoing the
procedure have survived an average of 29 months, with the longest
survival five years, he said.
   Survival for the other patients has averaged 22 months, and two
of the patients whose cancer has come back are still alive, he
said.
   That is considerably longer than the projected survival of six
months to nine months after diagnosis among comparable liver cancer
patients who don't have cryosurgery, Onik said.
   He and his colleagues also are testing ultrasound-guided
cryosurgery for prostate cancer, and among seven patients who have
undergone it so far, no complications have resulted, Onik said.
   A cancer specialist lauded Onik's work.
   ``I think he's making an important contribution,'' said Dr.
Andrew Gage, deputy director of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute
in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Not only does Onik's technique offer hope to patients whose
lives otherwise probably would be lost, it also pioneers a method
in which doctors can watch the effects of surgery as they go, Gage
said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   The technique involves making an incision into the patient's
abdomen and using ultrasound to find the cancerous lesions in the
liver. A surgeon then inserts a probe into a lesion and freezes the
lesion with liquid nitrogen.
   ``You can watch the freezing envelop the tumor,'' Onik said.
``You can show what you've done.''
   Most malignant liver tumors develop from cancers that migrate
from the colon, Onik said, adding that the phenomenon strikes about
50,000 Americans a year. While colon cancer is relatively easy to
remove, liver cancer tends to be more scattered through the organ
and more problematic, he said.
   Gage said conventional surgery still would be the preferred
treatment for most liver cancer patients. Cryosurgery might be
better for about one person in 50, specifically, patients with too
many lesions to remove with a scalpel but not so many that they
involve the whole liver, he said.
   Liver transplants are not an option in cancer patients because
they require taking drugs to suppress the immune system and prevent
rejection of the donated organ. Anti-rejection drugs promote cancer
growth, causing tumors to ``pop up everywhere,'' Onik said.
   Ultrasound is a radar-like technique in which high frequency
sound waves are sent into the body to form an image.
   He said his work with ultrasound and cryosurgery follows success
with similar techniques in Japan and China.

   Anatoly Karpov on Tuesday accepted chess
champion Garry Kasparov's offer of a draw in the 14th game of the
World Chess Championship.
   The game left them deadlocked with seven points each. The 15th
game is scheduled for Wednesday.
   The Soviet rivals adjourned the game Monday night after five
hours of play, with Kasparov sealing his 41st move, Qc2. Both had
three pawns, a rook, a queen and king left.
   Without resuming play Tuesday, Karpov accepted Kasparov's offer
of a draw, which the champion had made Monday night.
   The first player to gain 12{ points, in a maximum of 24 games,
wins the championship and $1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In
the event of a tie, Kasparov retains the title.
   The two grandmasters were tied at six after the first 12 games
in New York, 10 of which were draws, between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7. The
second phase of the championship began Saturday in Lyon with the
13th game, another draw.

   A pall hung over Israel on Tuesday as it buried
three of its five soldiers killed in a clash with Palestinian
guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
   Radio stations played sad songs, and Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled,
commander of the sector where the deaths occurred, said: ``Today we
paid in a big way, heavily.''
   The shock over the latest deaths was compounded by the fact that
only two days earlier, four Israelis were shot and killed by an
infiltrator on the Egyptian border.
   In a commentary in the daily Maariv, Shmuel Schnitzer wrote:
``We have to learn to live with the feeling that death lurks
everywhere.''
   The border violence also includes two army deaths on the Jordan
River this month. ``I don't recall a month where we have paid such
a price,'' said an army officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In fact, the army has suffered much higher casualties during
Israel's 42 years of statehood. But the latest deaths caught the
Israeli public off guard - preoccupied by the 3-year-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories and the influx of
Soviet Jews.
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet was in
special session to debate the $37.5 billion state budget for 1991.
At issue was how to cover the costs of absorbing hundreds of
thousands of immigrants while maintaining a strong military
posture. No decision was reached.
   The army also faces a struggle to retain public confidence. It
has been wracked for months by a bitter race for the post of chief
of staff. And in the midst of the news of the deaths in Lebanon, it
emerged that a senior general had resigned in anger, complaining
that the army was ill-prepared for war.
   As head of training and planning, Maj. Gen. Moshe Bar-Kochba was
in charge of studying the lessons of past military setbacks. In a
letter broadcast by Israel radio, he claimed no one was paying
attention to his findings.
   All this, plus the undercurrent of worry that the Persian Gulf
crisis could drag Israel into war, has created an atmosphere of
foreboding.
   Bar-Kochba's letter ``came at a very bad moment,'' army
spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai told Israel television. ``I don't
think he intended it to be this way but that's how it came out.''
   At the hospital where his 20-year-old son Haim was recovering
from injuries suffered in the Lebanon clash, Pinchas Cohen, 50,
told reporters:
   ``It's too bad that our generation didn't solve our security
problems for our children, who are now fated to sacrifice their
lives.
   ``But we don't have much choice and we cannot allow this to
break us.''
   Cohen was the only Israeli wounded in the clash, which occurred
during the night but was not announced to Israelis until late
morning after the families of the dead had been notified.
   Those buried Tuesday were Staff Sgt. Roi Domb, Sgt. Amnon Kadmon
and Sgt. Gad Meinfeld. Maj. Yuval Veinstein and Staff Sgt. Guy Tal
were to be buried Wednesday.
   In a eulogy at the funeral for Meinfeld, his commander said the
guerrillas were headed to northern Israel to commit ``killing and
murder.''
   ``The terrorists' mission was foiled,'' Peled said. ``The
settlements of the north are safe. The price is unbearable.''

   Two inspectors who visited Iraq's nuclear
plants last week found no evidence that Baghdad is developing
atomic weapons for its arsenal, the International Atomic Energy
Agency said Tuesday.
   A brief statement by the United Nations agency said ``no change
had taken place in the status of nuclear material under
safeguards'' at the four sites since the last routine inspection in
April.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said:
   ``We would welcome that Iraq has decided to permit this
inspection.'' While the inspectors found no diversion of nuclear
material, Williams said the inspection ``doesn't tell what happens
in the future.''
   He also repeated the U.S. position that Iraq is continuing with
its program to manufacture nuclear weapons.
   The agency inspects nuclear facilities and fissionable materials
in various countries every six months under the Non-Proliferation
Treaty that prohibits the spread of nuclear technology for
non-peaceful use.
   The statement said inspectors in April also accounted for all
nuclear materials registered by Iraq with the agency, indicating
none had been diverted to develop weapons as Iraq's army prepares
for possible war against the multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush last week told U.S. troops in the region their
mission to push Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of occupied Kuwait was
marked by ``a real sense of urgency'' because of Baghdad's headway
in acquiring nuclear arms. He said it was not clear just how fast
Iraq could have such weapons ready for use.
   But a Nigerian and a Soviet inspector toured Iraq's two research
reactors, a storage and a fuel-producing plant Nov. 19-22 at
Baghdad's invitation, agency spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said.
The inspectors were accompanied by Iraqi officials as permitted
under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said.
   Both inspectors were experienced and had led verification groups
into Iraq before, Meyer said. He declined to reveal their names.
   Although the statement did not say specifically, they apparently
checked on a 27-pound mass of highly-enriched uranium that Iraq
salvaged from its Osirak nuclear reactor, which was destroyed by an
Israeli air attack in 1981.
   Some analysts in Israel, which closely tracks Iraq's arms
program, believe Baghdad could be two to five years away from
producing its own atomic warheads for missiles or nuclear bombs to
be dropped from jets.
   But other experts say a 10-year development phase is now needed
because of the international trade embargo imposed on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the oil-rich emirate.
   Israel claims Iraq is using the two reactors for its weapons
program with the help of 150 pounds of enriched uranium from
France, which sold the reactors to Iraq in 1976 for electricity
production.
   Israel brought the nuclear program to a halt when it bombed the
Osirak facility but claims development restarted in 1987.
   Baghdad has repeatedly denied the allegations.
   The Iraqi invitation to the agency inspectors appeared aimed at
removing one justification for an invasion of Iraq by the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia. The force has been deployed
since Baghdad invaded Kuwait.
   Some Western officials have claimed the Middle East can never be
safe, regardless of Kuwait's status, as long as President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq could threaten to use nuclear weapons.
   The agency has suspended all technical cooperation with Iraq in
line with U.N. sanctions following the invasion. But Meyer said the
inspection was not considered technical assistance.

   Technicians suspected a problem in the
manufacture of the Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror but never
told anyone and the $1.5 billion instrument was launched with a
blurred view of the universe, investigators said Tuesday.
   The manufacturer, Perkin-Elmer, did not assign its best people
to the telescope construction and ``there was a surprising lack of
participation by optical experts with experience in the manufacture
of large telescopes,'' the investigators' final report added.
   NASA released the study by a six-member panel headed by Dr. Lew
Allen, director of the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif.
   One flaw the panel found echoed a finding of the investigators
of the 1986 Challenger space shuttle accident. The Hubble report
said the management structure at Perkin-Elmer raised ``a strong
block'' against communication between people doing hands-on work
and higher-level experts.
   In the aftermath of the Challenger disaster, a lack of
communication between engineers and upper management was cited as a
contributing cause.
   The telescope, launched last April from the space shuttle
Discovery, cannot be focused properly because its
94.5-inch-diameter primary mirror is too flat in the center.
   The investigators determined quickly, and reiterated in their
final report, that an optical test used in the manufacturing
process was not set up correctly and ``thus, the surface was
polished into the wrong shape.''
   The report said there were ``clear indications of the problem
from auxiliary optical tests made at the time'' but that ``both
indicators of error were discounted at the time as being themselves
flawed.''
   It said the distortions in the mirror were seen during tests but
that the manufacturer believed the test was not reliable ``when in
fact, it was quite accurate enough to detect the gross error, and
indeed did so.''
   Perkin-Elmer design scientists, as well as management for both
the company and for NASA, failed to follow the fabrication process
``with reasonable diligence'' and were unaware of the flaws, the
report said. It did not single out any individuals.
   Efforts to reach company officials for comment on the report
were not immediately successful.
   The firm, which was a leading manufacturer of telescopes used in
space by the military, assigned its most capable optical scientists
to producing a small demonstration mirror and the design of both
the Hubble mirror and the test apparatus, the report said.
   But the fabrication of the mirror was the responsibility of the
Optical Operations Division, which operated in a closed-door
environment and used neither the optical design scientists or
available skills outside of the division.
   ``During the testimony, it was indicated that some technical
personnel in the Optical Operations Division were deeply concerned
at the time that the discrepant optical data might indicate a
flaw,'' the report said. ``There are no indications that these
concerns were formally expressed outside this division.''
   In the grinding of the Hubble mirror, as in all large telescope
mirrors, a device known as a reflective null corrector is used to
measure the accuracy of the polishing process. The corrector had
been preserved exactly as it was during the manufacture of the
mirror and the board found its lens was incorrectly spaced. The
amount of the error would account exactly for the blurred images
recorded by two cameras on the Hubble.
   NASA plans to put corrective lenses on the cameras during an
astronaut visit scheduled for early in 1993 and experts believe
that will solve the problem. Even without the corrections, the
Hubble has returned some spectacular pictures from space, many with
better resolution than ever seen by ground-based cameras.

   Lech Walesa appealed Tuesday to supporters
of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki to help him stop a
``dangerous'' outsider from becoming Poland's president.
   One of Walesa's sharpest critics agreed. ``Today (Walesa) is the
only candidate worth cosidering,'' wrote Editor Adam Michnik, a
veteran Solidarity activist and perhaps Walesa's most determined
political foe.
   ``A victory by Walesa would involve high risk for Poland. But a
victory by (Stanislaw) Tyminski would bring the absolute certainty
of extreme degradation,'' Michnik said in a front-page editorial in
Gazeta Wyborza, the country's largest newspaper.
   The election success Sunday of the wealthy emigre businessman
Tyminski denied Walesa an absolute majority triumph and eliminated
Mazowiecki from the Dec. 9 presidential runoff.
   The East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister then
announced late Monday he would resign along with his 15-month-old
government.
   Tyminski, who had only just returned from a 21-year sojourn in
Peru and Canada, mounted a free-spending campaign characterized by
sharp attacks on the government and promises of quick economic
improvement.
   At a news conference in Warsaw, the dark-horse candidate praised
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's 1981 imposition of martial law to crush
Solidarity. He said the country at the time was under ``unusual
danger'' from within.
   Walesa asked Mazowiecki backers during a news conference at
Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk to help him defeat Tyminski.
   ``We are doomed to be together,'' the Solidarity chairman said.
``We should pull this common Polish wagon together.''
   ``You cannot put Poland into hands that have not been checked,
lacking any background,'' he said. ``What is happening now is
dangerous.''
   Walesa polled 40 percent of the electorate Sunday compared to 23
percent for Tyminski and 18 for Mazowiecki.
   Walesa said he had warned the prime minister that the movement
was losing the support of the masses.
   ``Those people who were with Mazowiecki, who really worked so
hard, did not want to understand,'' he said. ``This cold shower
will wake us all up and we will think seriously about reforms in
Poland.''
   Jaruzelski, the lame duck president, formally asked Mazowiecki
on Tuesday to head a caretaker government until the next president
nominates a prime minister.
   Walesa told a news conference that he would maintain the
Mazowiecki economic program, but with ``certain corrections.''
   Walesa said he planned to telephone Mazowiecki and appeal for
``not multiplying the tension.''
   There was no confirmation from Mazowiecki's office, but aides to
Walesa in Gdansk said talks were being carried out with ``the
highest officials'' in Warsaw.
   Tyminski at his news conference attacked sacred cows of Polish
political life. He praised Jaruzelski and criticized Mazowiecki for
his economic policies and for alleged cooperation with Communist
authories as a journalist in the early 1950s.
   Of Jaruzelski's martial-law decision, he said: ``I hope that
this country understands now how much has been done for it by
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, because at that moment (in 1981) the
country was in unusual danger ... from within, because the hand
that did the injury for so many years was always our own.''
   ``They are very irresponsible,'' Tyminski said referring to the
government's shock economic reform program instituted in January to
almost universal praise from the world financial community. ``Even
if nothing had been done, there would not be destruction on such a
scale.''
   Mazowiecki said in his resignation statement Monday night that
he had been brought down by lack of public patience for the
sacrifices required to improve the economy.
   ``Society made its choice,'' said the taciturn prime minister,
who took office in August 1989 after decades as a writer in the
Catholic opposition.
   Meanwhile, Zdzislaw Najder - a historian and former head of the
Polish section of Radio Free Europe - told the state PAP news
agency that he ``could not exclude'' being named prime minister and
forming a government under Walesa. Najder heads Walesa's national
Citizens Committee movement.
   ``I know that there are people of greater authority and
experience. ... My trump is a considerable familiarity with the
world at large,'' PAP quoted Najder as saying.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Moderate Food Prices, Big Farm Incomes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department projected on
Tuesday that consumer food prices will climb more slowly in 1991
and that farmers will see near-record incomes as production
increases.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said there are still some
trouble spots but ``the situation has changed for the better'' from
the financial crunch of the mid-1980s.
   ``The overall economic health of this industry is infinitely
improved over what is was five years ago,'' Yeutter told the
department's annual outlook conference.
   James R. Donald, chairman of the department's World Agricultural
Outlook Board, said the 1991 forecast calls for an average food
price increase of 2 percent to 5 percent, compared with almost 6
percent this year.
   ``Projected record meat supplies, higher dairy product output
and the likelihood of bigger citrus crops this season will moderate
food price rises,'' he said.
   Donald also said food marketing costs will rise more slowly if
overall inflation eases to around 4.5 percent instead of this
year's 5.5 to 6 percent.
   Donald said farmers will expand 1991 plantings of several crops
to take advantage of more flexibility under new farm program
provisions.
   Globally, he said, commodity production ``will increase
substantially'' in 1990-91 and that production of livestock
products ``will reach a new record as red meat recovers and poultry
supplies continue to increase.''
   Some U.S. products will face rising competition from other
countries, particularly for wheat. And U.S. meat export increases
probably will slow as Japan cuts back on imports.
   ``The big news next year will be grains, and plenty of it,''
Donald said. ``For the last three years, the world has been
consuming more grain than it produced, working down stocks.
   ``But production shot ahead this year. While grain consumption
is rising by another 2 percent ... production is up 5 percent to a
new record.''
   Donald said the outlook for 1991 ``points to a year of
near-record incomes for U.S. farmers'' as cash receipts rise with
larger sales and higher prices for a few commodities.
   Meanwhile, farmers will see production expenses increase, partly
because of higher prices for energy-related items.
   But even with those higher expenses, Donald said 1991 cash
income of farmers will be in the range of $55 billion to $60
billion, slightly less than this year's record high of $59 billion.
   Net cash income is simply the difference between gross cash
income in a calendar year and cash expenses.
   In another way of accounting, 1991 net farm income may be in the
range of $44 billion to $49 billion, compared with this year's
record of $49 billion. That takes into account a number of factors,
including changes in inventory values and other adjustments.
   A year ago, looking at 1990, the department's forecasters
predicted food prices would rise 3 to 5 percent. Hard freezes in
late December helped boost fruit and vegetable prices much faster
than had been anticipated.
   The year-ago prediction for net cash income of farmers was in
the range of $52 billion to $57 billion. Net farm income at that
time was forecast in 1990 at $46 billion to $49 billion.

   Believing that reading newspapers and getting
involved in government are keys to a free society, a businessman
Tuesday initiated a scholarship program that encourages high school
students to do both.
   ``The idea is to get everybody involved,'' said Carlos Roca,
owner of Main Line Foto Inc. ``By bringing in the newspaper we can
make sure that they understand what's going on, and that's the
first part of the whole process.''
   Roca's Pennsylvania-based company, which distributes film and
other supplies to newspapers, is starting the Citizenship Education
Scholarship Program at three San Antonio high schools.
   The program will start with current events classes, using
newspapers as a primary resource. Roca hopes the program for
minorities, disadvantaged youths and new Americans will spread to
other schools and cities.
   A newspaper is ``an educational tool, just like your school
book,'' Roca said. ``But this one is going to last the rest of your
life.''
   ``Ben Franklin said it: a free press will keep this country
free,'' Roca said. ``But it's only a free press if people read it.
I come from a newspaper family so I know how important it is to
read a newspaper.''
   Roca, 28, who is of Puerto Rican descent, said he learned from
his family's newspaper background the importance of newspapers in a
democracy.
   ``Nowadays, one of the problems we're having is kids don't read
newspapers. And unless they do, we're all in big trouble, because
that is what keeps this country free,'' Roca said.
   His father, Gaspar Roca, is president and publisher of El Vocero
de Puerto Rico, the largest Hispanic daily in the United States.
   Following the classroom instruction, students will travel to
Washington for a week of seminars and meetings organized by the
Close Up Foundation, a non-profit, non-partisan education group.
   ``I'm just a normal student. To have something like this, I feel
I'm going to be a part of the big picture,'' said scholarship
recipient Barry Huff, a 17-year-old senior at East Central High
School.
   Jennifer Berry, 16, a junior at East Central, said she's eager
to learn how government in Washington works.
   ``I'm very happy that I got a scholarship, because otherwise I
wouldn't be able to go,'' she said.
   On Tuesday, Roca presented $1,600 to East Central. He also is
awarding the same amount to Sam Houston and Sidney Lanier high
schools.
   Each school is allowed to divide the money among as many
students as it likes. East Central picked three students. The other
schools had not yet decided how many students would receive the
scholarship.
   The San Antonio Independent School District, in turn, is
honoring Roca with a ``Friend of Education'' award.
   The students will raise some of the more than $600 each will
need for the trip. And some of the program money in San Antonio
will be generated by a percentage of Main Line Foto sales to the
San Antonio Express-News.
   ``It's a great program, and I think it's a healthy one,'' said
Express-News Publisher W. Lawrence Walker Jr., who invited the
students to visit the newspaper before their trip in February.
   Roca said he decided to give out the first scholarships in San
Antonio after meeting Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, and learning
about the area.
   Roca said he selected the Close Up Foundation because of its
reputation for allowing students to interact with government
officials. More than 25,000 students take part in Close Up each
year.
   Main Line Foto is a full line professional stockhouse dealer of
film, paper and chemicals. The company, which Carlos Roca founded
in 1983 while in college at Villanova University, supplies about
900 newspapers nationwide.
   His company is one of the top 500 Hispanic-owned businesses in
the nation.

   Here is a brief look at the views of John Major,
elected as leader of the Conservative Party on Tuesday. He will
succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON THE GULF: ``There will be no difference in policy,'' Major
said. `` ... There is absolute unity that what has happened there
is unforgivable and that it has to be reversed.''
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON THE ECONOMY: In the mold of Margaret Thatcher, Major is a
rigorous free-marketeer who will follow her policies of selling
nationalized industries and holding down government spending. As
chancellor of the exchequer, he had kept interest rates high as
part of the government's program to combat inflation, currently
10.9 percent. He has said he would make some tax cuts in lower
brackets.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ON EUROPE: Major will show more enthusiasm for European monetary
union than Mrs. Thatcher did, but remains cautious. He drafted a
plan for a so-called ``parallel currency'' that would be used in
addition to the 12 national currencies. As chancellor, he took the
pound into Europe's exchange rate mechanism on Oct. 8.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LOCAL TAXES: Major has pledged to review the unpopular
per-capita ``poll tax,'' which has become a major political
liability for the Conservative Party, but has ruled out its
abolition. ``There is no consensus on what the change may be,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak's National
Democratic Party is virtually unopposed in Thursday's parliamentary
elections because of a boycott by major opposition groups.
   The 454-seat People's Assembly already has gained a reputation
as a rubber-stamp parliament for Mubarak's policies because of the
wide majorities his National Democratic Party has held in the three
parliaments since he became president in 1981.
   This combines with opposition party charges of vote-rigging to
hold down the number of people voting. Analysts expect even fewer
voters this time in light of the boycott and the absence of
campaign issues.
   ``We asked for constitutional changes time after time. The
political leadership never answered our demands,'' said Ibrahim
Farag of the New Wafd Party, one of those boycotting the election.
   ``We do not accept that we become an ornament for fake
democracy,'' he said.
   With only token opposition, the National Democrats have not had
to defend Egypt's deployment of 20,000 troops in Saudi Arabia
following Iraqi's invasion of Kuwait. Instead, National Democrats
have wound up debating pocketbook issues: the economy,
unemployment, commodity shortages and inflation.
   Their main campaign asset has been the 62-year-old president,
who is apparently enjoying increased popularity because of his
unflinching opposition to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   The National Democrats fielded 444 candidates, one for each
elective seat in the chamber. Under the constitution, Mubarak
appointees take 10 seats.
   Mubarak suspended the outgoing parliament Sept. 26 because of a
ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court that the 1987 elections
were unconstitutional.
   The president later decreed that parliamentary candidates must
run as individuals even if they are party members. The decree
invalidated a party-ticket system struck down by the court.
   Egypt has nine opposition groups, including the banned but
government-tolerated Moslem Brotherhood.
   Boycotting the elections are the Moslem Brotherhood, the New
Wafd Party, the Socialist Labor Party and the Liberal Party. In the
disbanded parliament, the Brotherhood and its Socialist and Liberal
allies held about 60 seats, and the New Wafd had 35.
   The National Unionist Progressive Party and the Moslem
fundamentalist Umma Party are taking part in the elections. They
held no seats in the old assembly.
   Three new parties are campaigning: the Egyptian Greens Party,
the Young Egypt Party and the Democratic Unionists Party.
   With only 101 candidates, the opposition parties pose no problemfor
the National Democrats, who include nine Cabinet ministers and
have the state-run news media at their disposal.
   More than 2,000 candidates campaigned without party ties. But
the government press said more than half are Mubarak loyalists.
   ``We expected that parties that said they would boycott would
run through independent candidates,'' said Rifaat el-Saeed of the
National Unionist Progressive Party.
   ``There are at least 68 Moslem Brotherhood members campaigning
(as independents) under the slogan `Give Us Your Vote So We Can
Mend the World with Religion,' as well as a large number of
Wafdists and 23 Liberals,'' el-Saeed said.
   Maamoun el-Hodeiby, the Moslem Brotherhood's secretary-general,
denied that more than two members of his group campaigned. Farag
said 30 Wafdists ran as independents and were expelled from the
party.
   El-Saeed said his party is participating because to boycott is
to give up. ``We feel that boycotting is like admitting it is
impossible to bring about change through democracy and
parliament,'' he said.
   A key demand of opposition forces is that voters be required to
produce identification. Now a voter gives his name and casts his
ballot after his name is checked off a list.
   ``My father died in 1975,'' said el-Saeed. ``Every year since
then when I go to vote, I see on the list that a check has been
made opposite his name showing that he's voted.''

   The value of U.S. agricultural exports is
expected to drop 4 percent this fiscal year to $38.5 billion, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The value of those exports rose to a nine-year high of more than
$40.1 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   The volume of shipments also will drop 6 percent to around 139.5
million metric tons, about 154 million short tons, as sales of corn
and other coarse grains decline, the department's Economic Research
Service said.
   Although the decline in 1991 had been expected by the agency for
some time, it was the first official forecast to include specific
values and quantities.
   ``Lower world grain trade is expected following larger harvests
by traditional grain importers, and the U.S. share of world grain
trade is expected to fall following increased competitor
production,'' the report said.
   Also, the report said, larger 1990-91 world wheat output has
brought sharply lower wheat prices.
   Corn exports will drop largely because of a one-third cutback in
the Soviet Union's corn import needs.
   However, higher prices are forecast for soybeans and soybean
meal, which will offset declines in the volume of shipments, the
report said.
   U.S. agricultural imports were projected to drop slightly to $22
billion in 1990-91 from a record $22.5 billion last year.

   The Supreme Court was asked Tuesday to free a
Rhode Island college from having to pay nearly $44,000 to a nursing
student because it kicked her out for being too fat.
   Outside, the debate centered on alleged discrimination against
fat people.
   But inside, the court heard 60 minutes of technical, legalistic
arguments pitting Salve Regina College in Newport, R.I., against
Sharon L. Russell, now a nurse in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   What the justices must decide by July is whether a federal
appeals court correctly deferred to a federal trial judge's
interpretation of Rhode Island common law. A ruling that such
deference was warranted will mean Ms. Russell's victory is upheld.
   But Steven Snow, a Providence, R.I., lawyer representing the
college, argued Tuesday that the appeals court should have rendered
its own interpretation of state common law rather than defer to the
trial judge.
   His contention drew numerous probing questions, especially from
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens and Byron R. White.
   At one point, O'Connor noted that most federal appeals courts
have shown trial judges the same deference when considering state
law issues that land in federal court.
   Edward T. Hogan, the East Providence, R.I., lawyer for Ms.
Russell, argued that forcing appeals courts to engage in the type
of review Snow suggested would result in ``a waste of time.''
   Ms. Russell, who has become a champion in the fight against size
discrimination, weighed over 300 pounds when dismissed from Salve
Regina in 1985.
   She had entered the co-ed Catholic school three years previously
and received excellent grades through her freshman and sophomore
years. But after beginning her nursing studies, Ms. Russell was
told by faculty members her weight concerned them.
   After being dismissed, Ms. Russell transferred to another school
and obtained her nursing degree. She also sued the college, and a
federal jury awarded her $44,000 on a breach-of-contract claim.
   Now a pediatric nurse at All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, Ms. Russell did not attend the court hearing.
   The facts of her legal case barely were mentioned Tuesday. Snow,
the school's lawyer, was about five minutes into those facts when
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist told him there wasn't much point
to continuing.
   Taking the chief justice's cue, Snow quickly delved into the
sole legal point being studied by the court. But in those five
minutes, Snow managed to state that Ms. Russell's ``size did become
a problem during the clinical training'' and that her ``severe
eating disorder'' had resulted in ``morbid obesity.''
   Outside the court building, Ms. Russell's lawyer told reporters
his client hoped to win the case and have her victory be seen as
``supportive'' of the rights of other fat people.
   ``They were wrong in pressing the issue of her weight,'' Hogan
said. ``She's just as big as she ever was'' and is functioning well
as a nurse, he said.
   Actually, Ms. Russell now weighs about 285 pounds. She recently
was the keynote speaker at a convention of the 3,000-member
National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance.
   The case is Salve Regina College vs. Russell, 89-1629.

   A German-flagged ship loaded with two heavy
boxes that could not be opened was diverted from its destination by
a guided missile cruiser patrolling the Red Sea, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the USS Biddle intercepted
the Premier in the northern part of the Red Sea last Thursday.
   As a result of the U.N. sanctions, U.S. and allied ships have
been patrolling both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea to prevent
goods from entering and leaving Iraq.
   On board the Premier, U.S. officials found two sealed boxes and
a manifest that had been altered. The ship was not allowed to
proceed to its port of destination.
   ``Things just didn't square up,'' Williams said. He said
officials did not know what was inside the boxes.
   Williams said he could not say where the ship was headed or
where it was diverted to. In the past, there have been allegations
that Jordan had allowed goods bound for Iraq to enter through the
port of Aquaba, which is on the Red Sea. Jordan has denied the
allegations.
   In another incident, Williams said the USS Thomas C. Hart, a
Navy frigate, along with a French and a Spanish ship, intercepted
the Khawala Bint Al Zawra, an Iraqi-flagged cargo ship in the Red
Sea Monday night.
   The ship was allowed to proceed after a boarding party
determined it held nothing bound for Iraq. The ship had a crew of
33 plus 97 other passengers, who were mostly crew members from
other ships that had been diverted, Williams said.

   Mayor Richard Arrington backed a
citywide curfew for youths under age 17, then decided to delay
presenting it to City Council.
   Arrington had said he would make the proposal Tuesday, but he
told the council more research was needed. He said he plans to
submit the proposal, and other measures to halt an increase in
youth violence, in two weeks.
   The curfew would be similar to one that went into effect
recently in Atlanta.
   Like that curfew, the Birmingham proposal is being attacked by
civil libertarians as an infringement of young people's
constitutional rights.
   In addition to the curfew, a task force formed by Arrington
proposed stiff new laws against guns and drug possession, with
parents liable for children who become repeat offenders.
   Arrington, who is black, called on Birmingham's black majority
to support the curfew and crackdown.
   ``In the past, these measures have not been supported by blacks
because they believe they are racist,'' he said. He added that ``a
disproportionate amount of young people involved in crimes are
black. But the victims are also black, and somehow we've got to get
that across. We need to support these tough measures.''
   Neil Bradley, associate director of the Southeastern regional
office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the proposed
curfew would be unconstitutional and would be challenged in court
if enacted.
   The task force was formed in the wake of the fatal shooting of
an 11-year-old girl by a 14-year-old boy outside a public school.

<TEXT>
   The United States hasn't had as
many ships in one region in the last 45 years.
   But to face Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the aircraft carriers
America, Roosevelt and Ranger and their estimated 240 aircraft are
set to join the Kennedy, the Saratoga and the Midway ringing the
Arabian peninsula. And the battleship Missouri is to join the USS
Wisconsin already in the gulf.
   The United States is busy bringing together ``the most naval
forces that we've had in any one location since World War II,''
according to Rear Adm. Daniel P. March, commander of the Seventh
Fleet's Battle Force.
   But March, 51, does not anticipate serious problems coordinating
all the various vessels in the Persian Gulf region, including those
from many other allied nations.
   ``From a command and control standpoint ... a lot of forces do
make things a little bit more complex but we're used to joint
operations,'' he said.
   March pointed out that three carrier groups and two battleship
groups exercised in the Pacific last year in what then was the
largest naval deployment since the 1940s.
   The admiral spoke to reporters from his base aboard the Midway,
the Navy's oldest and smallest carrier.
   Boatswain John Smith called it a ``Volkswagen' in comparison to
the ``Cadillac' it just relieved - the USS Independence.
   Because the Midway is shorter and lighter, March acknowledged
the ship can't carry as many bombs, missiles, shells, fuel or
supplies.
   But he and other officers said the United States' only
foreign-based carrier fosters a special esprit de corps.
   ``Midway attracts a kind of a unique breed,'' noted Lt. Dave
Myer, 37, of Orlando, Fla. ``We never go home. We don't go back to
the States. So we're out here operating all the time. And I like
that.''
   March described the air wing's responsibility: ``The mission is
to put aircraft over the beach in support of the objectives, in
support of troops in the field, in support of interdiction, in
support of targets.''
   The commodore of the carrier's destroyer squadron said Iraq is
keeping a low profile in the area.
   ``We check out about a hundred ships a day coming in or going
out of the gulf,'' said Capt. J.W. Parker. ``We haven't had
occasion to board any. It sort of indicates that the Iraqis have
changed their procedures a little bit.''
   After the multinational force boarded vessels to enforce the
U.N. sanctions against trade with Iraq following the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, Parker speculates that Baghdad decided against
challenging the naval blockade - at least on the gulf side of the
Arabian peninsula.
   ``There are no Iraqi ships coming,'' he said.

   ABC won the network ratings race Tuesday for
the first time in the 10-week-old fall season with a big boost from
Monday night football and a Stephen King horror story.
   ``Stephen King's `It' Part 2'' finished second in A.C. Nielsen
Co. rankings, followed by ABC's NFL Monday night showdown between
the Los Angeles Raiders and the Miami Dolphins.
   The most watched show on television was CBS' weekly news
magazine ``60 Minutes,'' featuring an interview with ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' and ``Platoon'' film director Oliver Stone.
   ABC finished first in overall network ratings with a 13.4
average. NBC was second with 11.8 and CBS third with 11.3. Last
week's figures marked the widest margin between first and second
place since all four World Series games were broadcast in prime
time last month.
   Each ratings point represents 931,000 households.
   In another first, NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' earned the lowest
ratings of its 7-year history with a Thanksgiving night repeat that
plummeted the longstanding hit series to 39th place.
   Cosby's fall also provided Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``The
Simpsons'' with its first ratings victory since the animated
family's highly publicized move to Thursdays at 8 p.m. An original
episode of the bickering cartoon clan tied for 37th place, edging
past ``Cosby'' by three-tenths of a rating point.
   ABC scored high with ``America's Funniest People,'' a spin-off
of its successful ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' with fourth
and fifth place finishes, respectively.
   CBS' perennial favorite ``Murder, She Wrote'' landed in the No.
6 slot, followed by its Emmy-winning comedy series ``Murphy Brown''
and the wisecracking interior decorators of ``Designing Women.''
   NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' placed ninth. ``Empty Nest,'' also on
NBC, finished 10th.
   In the network news wars, ABC and Peter Jennings held onto their
longstanding first place status with a 10.2 average. CBS and Dan
Rather were second with 9.6 and Tom Brokaw and NBC finished last
with 8.8.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 22.5; ``Stephen King's `It' Part 2,'' ABC, 20.6;
``NFL Monday Night Football,'' ABC, 18.2; ``America's Funniest
People,'' ABC, 18.1; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 17.9;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS, 17.8; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, 17.7;
``Designing Women,'' CBS, 17.6; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC, 17.5; and
``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 17.4.

<TEXT>
   A strike that has paralyzed rail traffic in
eastern Germany spread to freight lines and more passenger trains
Tuesday, but workers agreed to talk with management and resume
international service.
   The Union of German Rail Workers, seeking higher pay and
guarantees against layoffs, has staged the first major work
stoppages since the two Germanys unified on Oct. 3.
   The three-day strike also has severely disrupted rail traffic
with neighboring Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The union said it would seek exploratory talks Wednesday with
the Reichsbahn, the name of the rail system of former East Germany.
Negotiations could begin immediately to end the strike if the union
believed management was prepared to meet workers' terms, said Rudi
Schaefer, head of the union.
   Earlier, workers had said no talks would be held until
management offered an acceptable compromise.
   Claudia Ruttmann, spokeswoman for the Reichsbahn in Berlin, said
officials were prepared to discuss workers' demands for higher pay
and guarantees against layoffs.
   The walkouts began in Berlin on Sunday evening and spread
throughout all of eastern Germany, forcing international passenger
trains to halt in Czechoslovakia and delaying thousands of
passengers.
   In Germany, the strike first affected inter-city trains. It
spread Tuesday to freight and passenger trains in the Berlin area.
   About 260,000 Reichsbahn employees voted to strike after
negotiations broke down last week.
   Strike leaders fear up to 68,000 workers in the former East
Germany will be laid off as the railroad and the economy undergo
capitalist restructuring. Similar cutbacks are predicted in other
industries in the former Communist nation.
   The rail strikers are demanding protection against massive
layoffs and recommend reduction of the work force gradually through
attrition.
   Union officials say the eastern workers are aid $675 to $945 a
month, about $675 less than their counterparts in former West
Germany. The union wants salaries to reach 60 percent of western
scales in January, but its primary demand is no mass layoffs.
   The German ADN news agency said more than 150,000 travelers were
delayed on Monday and that train traffic to and from Poland also
was suffering long delays.
   The rail line carried an average of 1.6 million passengers a day
in 1989.
   Meanwhile, members of the Public Service and Transport Union
working for NATO forces based in western Germany held a second day
of warning strikes to force an agreement for new work contracts and
layoff provisions.
   With a reduction of military forces in Europe, up to 23 percent
of the approximately 100,000 civilian employees working for U.S.,
British and other NATO forces are expected to be laid off in the
near future, union officials say.
   Among the strikers' demands are guarantees of retraining and job
placement in case of layoffs and adequate severence pay for those
who cannot find new jobs.
   The union said up to 12,000 civilian workers at military
installations throughout Germany took part in warning strikes of up
to two hours on Tuesday.
   The union says the the strikes are not intended to interfere
with military operations involving deployment of troops to the
Middle East.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force European Headquarters at
Ramstein Air Base, said the Air Force on Tuesday ``did experience
some vehicle traffic delays at Zweibruecken and Bitburg Air
Bases.''

<HEAD>ACLU: FBI Spies on Human-Rights Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union charged in a
lawsuit Tuesday that the FBI illegally kept files on the leader of
a group that supports human rights activities around the world.
   The lawsuit contends the FBI maintained files on J. Roderick
MacArthur Foundation and its president, Lance Lindblom, since 1985
and has released only heavily blacked-out copies of 22 pages of
material in those files under a Freedom of Information Act request.
   ``I am outraged that my own country engages in such insidious
police state tactics of keeping files on law-abiding organizations
and people,'' Lindblom told reporters.
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
   The ACLU contends the FBI files violate the Constitution's First
Amendment freedom of speech rights and the Privacy Act, which
restricts the government from keeping such files on ordinary
citizens.
   The ACLU said the FBI material has a chilling effect on Lindblom
and the foundation.
   ``It's chilling because it's this kind of surveillance that
created the blacklists in the 1950s, and it's chilling because it
forces people to conform,'' said Harvey Grossman, legal director of
the Illinois ACLU chapter.
   Lindblom said the FBI's involvement has affected the
foundation's business.
   ``I think it affects people dealing with us,'' he said. ``And
how do you tell your 5- and 6-year-old sons - which I had to do
last night - why the FBI is investigating you. That was chilling
enough.''
   In Washigton, FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez said the bureau
does not comment on pending litigation.
   The FBI cited ``an exemption under the Privacy Act in order to
protect the national defense'' for not providing Lindblom more
information, Grossman said.
   The lawsuit seeks unedited copies of all material in the file,
destruction of the file, an admission that the FBI acted unlawfully
and monetary damages to be decided by a jury, Grossman said.
   Grossman said the material the FBI supplied was so heavily
edited it was impossible to determine anything about the probe,
except for a newspaper column about Lindblom traveling with a South
Korean political dissident.
   Lindblom said he often travels overseas and his foundation helps
defend political dissidents on trial in sensitive areas of the
world, but ``my action is above board.''
   The foundation is based in suburban Niles. It has no connection
with the John D. and Catherine MacArthur Foundation, although it
was founded by their son, Roderick, and the two groups support some
of the same projects, Lindblom said.
   It has made grants totaling $26 million since its founding in
1976 to other charitable organizations to champion social justice,
Lindblom said.
   He said the foundation has supported such social action
documentary films as the 1989 movie, ``Roger and Me,'' about the
impact of the closing of General Motors plants on the lives of
Michigan residents.

   An explosion and fire in a transformer in
Montreal knocked out power in a large part of the downtown area
Tuesday, shutting down the whole subway system.
   Police Constable Jacques Patenaude said the fire broke out about
10:30 a.m. in an underground transformer in the heart of the
business district. About 500 office buildings and stores were
affected by the outage, he said.
   By late afternoon, scattered blackouts were still reported in

   Nicole Breton, a spokesman for the Montreal transit commission,
said the subway system citywide was stopped and passengers
evacuated as a safety measure after communications between the

<HEAD>Foley Shares Insights With Freshman Congressmen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Tuesday
welcomed freshman Democrats to Congress and advised them to take
junkets and miss votes.
   But not a lot of votes.
   ``Figure out within the first month, some matter of generally
non-consequence on the floor, and sit through a vote. Miss a vote.
Miss a couple,'' Foley, a Washington Democrat, advised two dozen
incoming lawmakers.
   ``For heaven sake, do not make the mistake of getting a 100
percent voting record. It is a great sentence of life in prison ...
living in uneasy terror'' that the House could hold a sudden vote
and ruin that record.
   He recalled a member who kept a perfect record for years only to
have it ruined by a quick, unexpected vote. That member, the
speaker said, ``wept on the floor.''
   Foley, himself just returned from the Persian Gulf, told the
group that ``whenever you get a chance, travel.
   ``I think it's well worth the government's expense'' for members
to see ``the matters on which we legislate,'' he said.
   Foley addressed the Democratic members at a luncheon on one side
of Capitol Hill, while Republicans were meeting with their own at a
nearby hotel.
   The official, bipartisan orientation for new members was
scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   The 102nd Congress will include 18 freshman Republicans and 25
incoming Democrats plus independent socialist Bernie Sanders of
Vermont. Overall, barring any election reversals before Jan. 3, the
lineup at the swearing-in will be 167 Republicans and 267
Democrats, plus Sanders.
   Sanders attended the Democratic Party sessions on Tuesday and
was applying to organize with the Democrats to obtain his committee
assignments.
   Most of the orientation meetings Tuesday were held in private,
except for Foley's address. The topics for the sessions run from
the Persian Gulf and the federal budget to the mundane, items like
office computers, personnel practices and financial disclosure
requirements.
   Overlaying all of the specifics was a sort of intellectual
indoctrination into the culture of the Capitol.
   Foley, first elected to Congress in 1964, spent much of his time
telling tales of how bad it used to be for freshman members.
   Once, a junior congressman was even declared ``dead'' by a
committee chairman and barred from all participation, until
colleagues pleaded for a reprieve.
   In another case, a chairman was confronted by a committee member
with an amendment and became annoyed. The chairman asked his top
aide who the lawmaker was and how long he'd been on the committee.
   ``Fourteen years Mr. Chairman,'' was the proverbial reply.
   Nowadays, Foley said, the chairmen and women know new members'
names ``within a matter of days, perhaps a week or so. And nobody's
going to declare you dead.''

<HEAD>Official News Agency Reports Death of Chinese Historian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of China's leading philosophers and
historians, Feng Youlan, has died, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday. He was 95.
   Xinhua said Feng died Monday of an unspecified illness.
   Feng, a former Beijing University professor, wrote ``History of
Chinese Philosophy,'' a multivolume set of books on the country's
political past.
   In an interview in 1986 with The Associated Press, Feng said
China's future does not depend on who succeeds senior leader Deng
Xiaoping but on how Communist Party factions settle their
differences.
   He also said the Communist Party would remain the sole political
force in China for at least 20 years because economic conditions
will not support a multiparty state.
   ``But there will be factions in the party. Now the party says
there are no factions. But everybody knows that's not the truth,''
Feng said.
   When asked to comment on who would succeed Deng as China's top
leader, Feng said personalities are not as important as political
methods.
   ``I don't think there must be one top leader without whom the
country will be thrown into confusion,'' he said. ``At present,
China is not mature enough for a collective leadership, but it will
be in the future.''
   Feng attended Columbia University in New York City from 1919-23.
He went back in 1982 to receive an honorary doctorate.

   Growth in world trade is unlikely to be seriously
affected by the conflict in the Persian Gulf, according to a report
from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Industrialized countries are now better able to cope with high
energy prices than during the last oil shock, according to the
report from the secretariat of the 100-nation trade forum.
   ``Economic activity is less dependent on energy than in the
1970s, the inflation rate is less than half what it was in 1979,
and policy-makers have learned the lesson that monetary
accommodation of a real price shock has persistent inflationary
effects,'' it said.
   The report, released Wednesday, pointed out that current crude
oil prices of $30 to $35 a barrel were lower than the peak of 1981,
when crude reached the equivalent of $50 a barrel.
   ``While the general situation remains highly uncertain, GATT's
economists believe that the growth in the volume of world trade in
1990 is unlikely to be seriously affected by the gulf crisis,'' it
said.
   The report estimated the volume of world merchandise exports
will expand 6 percent this year, down from a 7 percent increase in
1989.
   But the report warned that Third World countries, highly
indebted nations and Eastern European economies would be hit
hardest by the oil price rises.
   The report also said a successful conclusion next month of the
Uruguay Round of trade talks would likely ``create a stronger basis
for the world economy in the 1990s.''
   It said ``competition is the best path to rising living
standards.''
   The report made no predictions on what would happen if the
complex negotiations collapse. They are now held up over
disagreements on the size of cuts in farm subsidies.
   The report said the value of world merchandise trade in 1989
rose 7.5 percent to a record $3.1 trillion. Exports of manufactured
goods outperformed those of farm products, which rose by 4 percent
in volume and 5 percent in value.
   World trade in commercial services like transportation and
telecommunications rose an estimated 9 percent to $680 billion.
Services now account for nearly one-fifth the total value of world
exports.
   The report said the volume of world trade in the 1980s rose by
50 percent while its dollar value increased by three-quarters.

<HEAD>Massive Model Block City Finally Finds a Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marc Kolodner's Lego City, a miniature
metropolis constructed with plastic blocks during his hyperactive
teen-age years, has been given a permanent home in a museum.
   The 4-by-8-foot city, complete with a furnished hotel and a
functioning drawbridge, took six years to build. It took three
years to find it a permanent home.
   The Baltimore Public Works Museum agreed this summer to display
Kolodner's masterpiece after he called the mayor's office for help.
The museum opened the exhibit Sunday.
   Kolodner, 22, used the thousands of Lego pieces his parents gave
him to channel his excessive energies in middle school and high
school.
   Lego pieces he received for birthdays, holidays and good grades
were added to the city and became an aiport, police station,
hospital, homes and even a two-deck cruise ship.
   ``He was a hyper little kid; he just couldn't sit still,'' said
Kolodner's mother, Phyllis. ``I had to find somewhere to channel
that energy, so first I put him on the tennis court, and then I
gave him Legos.''
   Kolodner said about three quarters of the city was constructed
according to instructions included with Legos kits. The rest he
improvised. He can't estimate the number of blocks used.
   ``It's a lot of money, that's for sure,'' he said.
   Like building the city, finding it a home proved to be a tedious
task.
   A first-year graduate student in physics at Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta, Kolodner said his city was too big for his
family's apartment. Schools, libraries and hospitals said they
couldn't handle its size, either.
   Lego City was on display more than two years ago at a Baltimore
toy store while Kolodner was an undergraduate at Tulane University
in New Orleans. But the store returned it after about six months
because it took up too much space.
   The city was stored in giant pieces in his family's apartment
until this summer, when Kolodner reconstructed it in the museum.

<HEAD>Sunday Liftoff Planned for Columbia and Oft-Delayed Astro-1
Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shuttle Columbia got a clean bill of
health Tuesday and NASA set the launching of its long-postponed
astronomy mission for Sunday.
   Columbia is to carry four major astronomical instruments,
including a telescope designed to investigate the content of stars
and the history of their formation, in a mission that was
originally planned for 1986.
   ``The shuttle team has worked very hard to get Columbia ready to
fly,'' said shuttle Director Robert Crippen. ``With the hydrogen
leak resolved, we're ready to end the year with the Astro-1 mission
which will extend our knowledge of the universe.''
   Columbia and its $150 million payload were scheduled to lift off
between 1:28 a.m. and 3:58 a.m. EST Sunday for a 10-day mission.
   Scientists who have waited years for the flight would prefer to
wait a little longer to take advantage of better celestial viewing
in mid-December. Certain astronomical targets, such as the
brightest visible quasar, will be farther from the sun than they
will be during the full moon Sunday. Astronomers prefer dark skies.
   The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, which studies the content and
history of stars, takes photographs of its celestial images,
explained NASA Mission Scientist Ed Weiler. He said shooting photos
into the scattered light of the moon is not preferable, just as no
photographer would shoot into the sun by choice.
   Three other major instruments will also be aboard Columbia. They
are the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, which will study quasars,
active galactic nuclei and supernova remnants; the Wisconsin
Ultraviolet Photo-polarimeter Experiment, which will measure the
polarization of ultraviolet light from hot stars, galactic nuclei
and quasars; and the Broad Band X-ray Telescope, which will
determine the amount of energy in electron volts of X-rays
emananting from clusters of galaxies, supernova remnants and stars.
   The astronomy mission was originally planned for March 6, 1986,
but the Challenger explosion Jan. 28 that year grounded all space
shuttles.
   After flights resumed, Astro-1 was rescheduled for launch March
1, 1990. The mission slipped to May 9, then to May 30. Six hours
before launch, a liquid hydrogen leak was discovered in Columbia
and the launch was scrubbed.
   Three more launch attempts failed, two of them because of
hydrogen leaks and one for a minor problem with the payload, before
an Oct. 30 leak check cleared Columbia.
   By then, workers were busy readying Atlantis for its secret
Pentagon mission Nov. 15. NASA held off scheduling a launch for
Columbia until Atlantis returned and was thoroughly inspected.
Tuesday, after a 5{-hour readiness review, officials gave the
go-ahead for the Sunday liftoff.
   The mission's countdown was set to begin one minute after
midnight Wednesday; the astronauts were due to arrive from Houston
on Thursday.
   Columbia will be commanded by astronaut Vance Brand, 59, making
his fourth trip into space. The others in the seven-member crew are
USAF Col. Guy Gardner, the pilot; mission specialists John Mike
Lounge, Jeffrey Hoffman and Robert Parker; and payload specialists
Ronald Parise and Samuel Durrance.

<TEXT>
   Clashes in black townships claimed
at least 11 lives Tuesday as President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson
Mandela said peace efforts were threatened but not thwarted.
   A joint statement by de Klerk and the African National Congress
leader indicated they could resolve differences and begin talks to
end white-minority rule.
   ``Having reaffirmed their commitment to and faith in the
peaceful negotiating process, they expressed their concern about
developments threatening this process,'' said the statement
following the two-hour meeting in the South African capital.
   Mandela said he and de Klerk probably would meet again in the
coming months. The statement stressed the importance of close
contacts between the two leaders.
   Mandela refused to give details of the meeting or even say what
issues were discussed. Mandela said ``the mood was very cordial''
and the talks were ``productive.''
   De Klerk did not speak to journalists.
   The topics apparently included the growing political violence,
charges from both sides of insincerity, and concern that efforts to
begin talks on ending apartheid are bogging down.
   Mandela had been expected to present the ANC's demand for an
interim government and multiracial elections for an assembly to
draft a new constitution. The government was expected to raise
concerns about ANC efforts to mobilize supporters and the growing
unrest in the country.
   Mandela and de Klerk have held several private meetings in
recent months to remove obstacles to full-scale negotiations on
ending white rule. The negotiations are expected to begin next
year, but both sides have expressed concern about growing political
disputes that could cause delays.
   Meanwhile, police said 11 men were shot and stabbed to death in
black factional fighting overnight in the township of Katlehong,
outside Johannesburg. A police official said the fighting
apparently involved rival Zulus and Xhosas.
   Five other people were killed in scattered violence in other
parts of the country, police said.
   Black violence, mostly between ANC supporters and Zulu followers
of the Inkatha movement, has claimed about 800 lives in the
Johannesburg area in recent weeks. The two groups are divided by
leadership disputes and conflicting views of a future South Africa.
   The ANC has charged the security forces are involved in a
campaign of terror against the opposition and have instigated black
factional violence. The government has rejected the charges.
   The ANC also contends an interim government is needed to ensure
all race groups are represented.
   But de Klerk has rejected the demand, saying his government will
remain in power until a new constitution is drafted to share power
with blacks.
   The government on Tuesday reportedly was to press for the ANC
and its military wing to suspend mass mobilization campaigns. The
government says the ANC campaigns violate an August agreement to
suspend the group's armed struggle.
   Mandela and other ANC leaders say the mobilization efforts are
part of peaceful political activities. The ANC has rejected
government demands it stop recruiting for its military wing.

bureau for Georgia and Alabama.
   The appointment was announced Tuesday by AP President Louis D.
Boccardi.
   In Atlanta, Ackerman succeeds Carl Bell, who is retiring Jan. 1.
   Ackerman, 48, began his AP career as a vacation-relief broadcast
newsman in New York City in 1968 and started full-time service on
the news cooperative's World Services Desk in 1972. A year later he
was named news editor in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   He was appointed chief of bureau in Lima, Peru, in 1975. In 1978
he was named bureau chief in Caracas, Venezuela. He returned to the
United States in 1980 as Cleveland correspondent. Two years later
he was selected as bureau chief for Louisiana and Mississippi,
based in New Orleans.
   In 1987 Ackerman was appointed chief of bureau for Michigan.
   A New York City native, he graduated from Davidson College with
a bachelor's degree in history in 1964 and then served in the Army,
stationed in the Panama Canal Zone and South America, from 1965 to
1967. After his Army service, he earned a master's degree in
history from the University of North Carolina and went to Argentina
on a Fulbright fellowship.

<TEXT>
   Bad news for brochure writers. The city touted by
many as among the world's most livable has been living up to an
older nickname: Rain City.
   Seattle already has had its third-wettest month ever, and more
rain is expected later this week. The drenching has caused tens of
millions of dollars in damage from flooding in western Washington,
killed one man and knotted traffic after a 1{-mile-long floating
bridge filled with water and sank.
   Gov. Booth Gardner declared emergencies in all but three western
Washington counties. Assessment crews began traipsing through
sodden river drainages Tuesday to tote up damage from more flooding
over the weekend that ravaged homes and farms along 20 rivers.
   State officials call the latest round some of the worst flooding
in Washington history, with four rivers reaching 100-year
flood-stage levels.
   Seattle in recent years has won numerous accolades for its
quality of life. Money magazine this year rated it the second-best
place to live in the nation, edged out by Bremerton, across Puget
Sound.
   In 1989, Money rated Seattle first, as did Places Rated Almanac,
while Savvy magazine ranked it among the best places to raise
children.
   The region has enjoyed nearly a decade of prosperity, thanks
mostly to record commercial aircraft sales by The Boeing Co., which
employs about 100,000 people here. Besides steady paychecks,
Seattle has become known for good food, good theater, great
scenery, an easygoing attitude and darn good coffee - more than 150
vendors sell espresso on city streets.
   Mayor Norm Rice took a moment Tuesday to acknowledge the city's
good fortune in the current catastrophe.
   ``Seattle itself was hit with extremely heavy rains, but we have
so far suffered only minor damage in the form of relatively few
flooded streets, wet basements and small mudslides,'' Rice said.
``Compared to many other areas of the state, Seattle has been very,
very lucky, so far.''
   But Rice noted that hillsides throughout the city are saturated,
and more rain or a freeze and thaw in the next few weeks could
trigger serious mudslides. Ironically, the city also faces a
drrinking water shortage, he said in calling for conservation.
   ``All that rain and high water have brought tons of silt into
the Cedar River, which is the major source of fresh drinking water
for much of our region,'' Rice said. ``Right now, the Cedar River
looks like chocolate milk.''
   The old Lake Washington floating bridge sank Sunday, damaging
anchoring cables on the adjacent, year-old Interstate 90 floating
bridge, the major east-west route into the city. The state
Department of Transportation shut the new bridge for repairs,
forcing tens of thousands of commuters to find other ways of
getting to work Monday.
   The new bridge was re-opened Tuesday for inbound traffic, as
seven huge tugboats labored to keep the 8,600-foot span in
position. Transportation spokesman Bill Southern said crews hustled
to install temporary cables and anchors but were worried about 40
mph winds forecast for Wednesday.
   Tuesday morning traffic actually was smooth, said Vickie
Crawford, a State Patrol communications supervisor. Backups were
heavy on the Evergreen Point floating bridge, the only other route
across the 20-mile-long lake, but not one stalled car or
fender-bender was reported on I-90, she said.
   City businesses reported a lot of late arrivals, but many
companies tried to help their employees by offering flexible start
times and encouraging carpools and taking the bus.
   Lisa Bowersock, a US West spokeswoman who commutes by bus from
across the lake in Redmond, said the bridge closure may have forced
more people out of their cars.
   ``The biggest traffic jam I've seen was at my park and ride
(parking lot) this morning,'' she said.
   Martin Thompson, National Weather Service forecaster in Seattle,
said Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has recorded 10.15 inches
of rain this month. The record for the wettest month ever was 12.92
inches, set in January 1953.
   More rain is on the way, and there's a good chance Sea-Tac will
get another inch before Friday, he said.
   The heavy rains are from the ``Pineapple Express,'' subtropical
air laden with moisture from the Hawaiian Islands, Thompson said.
That unusual weather system has passed, but more rain is expected
from the Gulf of Alaska.
   Steve Morris, spokesman for the Seattle-King County Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said all the soggy news hadn't dampened the
tourist trade.
   ``People understand it's a temporary condition,'' Morris said,
adding that from a tourism standpoint, the rains occurred at the
slowest time of the year.
   ``I don't know if we'll ever dispel the notion that it rains
sometimes in Seattle,'' he said.

   Assailants opened fire inside a game hall
and by a nearby butcher shop Tuesday night, killing eight people
and wounding seven, police said.
   State television said the attacks were apparently carried out by
a Mafia gang seeking to rub out members of a rival clan.
   Police said the two attacks occurred about 7 p.m. in the center
of this city of 80,000 residents on Sicily's southern coast.
   Six were killed when the assailants sprayed gunfire inside a
game hall crowded with people playing cards and billiards. Two
others were gunned down in front of a butcher shop down the street.
   RAI-TV said investigators suspect the assailants targeted
members of the ``Madonia'' crime family.
   Nearly 100 people have been killed in violence between rival
Mafia clans in Gela the past three years, according to news
reports. The gangs are fighting for control of extortion rackets,
drug trafficking and other illegal activities.

   John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the
politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative
Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister.
   Major, 47, fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting
among the 372 Coservative Party members of Parliament, but his two
opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major as
the winner.
   Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ years in power, intended to submit her
resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major
would then be called to lead the government.
   Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his
official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and
holding hands with his wife, Norma. Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came
next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence,
embraced Major. ``I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to
succeed me,'' the ``Iron Lady'' said in a statement released by
aides.
   ``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the
Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow
one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever
had,'' Major said.
   ``Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite
totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general
election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime
minister in this century.
   Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority. Former
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.
   Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials
declared Major elected.
   The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership
challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short
of victory in the first round of the leadership race.
   Mrs. Thatcher had not wanted to leave office, but she decided to
resign last week after she was unable to put down Heseltine's
challenge.
   She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand
against Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both
joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that
she was backing Major.
   The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare
recipient, Major personifies the values of self-reliance and hard
work that Mrs. Thatcher had preached to the nation.
   His election climaxed a month of British politics-turned-upside
down, and the Western world's longest-serving head of government
was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks.
   Heading a government that was trailing the opposition Labor
Party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local
Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Thatcher lost control of events after
her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on Nov. 1.
   Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes
over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of
Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's
vital interests.
   The next day, Heseltine announced he would challenge her. Six
days later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris
officially ending the Cold War, Heseltine polled enough votes to
deny her re-election as leader.
   Two days later, she decided to resign after party leaders told
her she could not win.
   Heseltine, 57, said Major's election ``lays the basis for the
unity of our party.''
   Hurd said the party needed to unite, and ``John Major is the
right leader for this task.''
   Opposition leaders derided Major's election as ``Thatcherism
with a different face.'' The Conservatives' main rivals, the
socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election.
   ``John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election
and that is how he got elected,'' said Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock. ``It means that the policies that brought the poll tax,
recession, heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on.''
   During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the
``poll tax,'' an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher,
but he gave no other hints of differing with her.
   While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of
Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares her opposition to a
single European currency and shares her belief in tight restraint
on government spending.
   However, he insisted over the weekend, ``I am not running as
`Son of Thatcher.' I am running as myself, with my own priorities
and my own programs.''
   Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine
to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
   ``Tomorrow always dawns,'' he said, smiling after conceding
defeat.
   Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign
secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.
   He moved up quickly in the leadership race. By the weekend,
opinion polls showed that Major was nearly as highly regarded by
the public as was Heseltine, who has been prominent for a decade.
   Major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the
Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major's own views
were more liberal than many supposed.
   He described himself as conservative on economic issues but
liberal on social issues.

<HEAD>Administration Worries Trade Talks Will Fail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top administration officials expressed concern
Tuesday over the prospect that a four-year effort to reform the
global trading system could end in failure because of a deadlock
over the issue of farm subsidies.
   The so-called Uruguay Round of talks are scheduled to wind down
next week in Brussels with a marathon bargaining session in which
trade ministers from 107 nations will attempt to resolve remaining
disputes.
   ``We must not let the Uruguay Round fail,'' President Bush said
in a speech in Monterrey, Mexico.
   However, back in Washington, other administration officials were
expressing the belief that unless the European Community retreats
from its current position on farm subsidies, the talks could
collapse.
   ``I came back very pessimistic about the outlook, and I'm still
pessimistic,'' said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. ``It
seems to me the position of the European Community is so far from
that of, essentially, the rest of the world that I see no way to
bridge that gap in the few days that remain.''
   Yeutter and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills recently
visited European leaders to urge compromises on agricultural issues
confronting Uruguay Round negotiators.
   The United States is pushing for a 75 percent reduction in
trade-distorting internal farm supports and a 90 percent cut in
farm export subsidies over 10 years.
   However, the European Community, seeking to protect millions of
small family farms, has only offered to cut internal supports by 30
percent from a 1986 base, a position the United States has termed
closer to an actual 15 percent cut from current levels - and
completely unacceptable.
   Japan, which wants to continue protecting its domestic farmers
by banning rice imports, is ``the only country that is at all
supportive'' of the EC position, Yeutter said.
   The EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and
Portugal. They have more than 4{ times as many farmers as the
United States in a population about a third larger, and the farmers
are a powerful political force.
   Another administration official, briefing reporters on condition
that he not be named, rejected the idea that the deadline for
completing the trade negotiations would likely be extended if the
farm issue is not settled next week.
   He said if the European Community does not indicate a
willingness to compromise on the farm subsidies, then it is
unlikely that a complete trade package can be achieved. He said
developing countries would be unwilling to agree to removal of
their barriers against foreign investment and trade in services
without a promise of expanded markets for their agricultural
products.
   ``It is only through a large package that you can achieve the
critical mass needed for an agreement,'' said the senior trade
official.
   If the talks fail and everyone goes home without liberalizing
global trading rules, it will mean a full-blown reappraisal of U.S.
policies, Yeutter told the Agriculture Department's annual outlook
conference.
   ``We'll have to determine how best to protect our own
interests,'' Yeutter said. ``In essence, we'll have to determine
how to get the most bang for the buck in a more confrontational
environment in international trade in agriculture, and perhaps in
international trade in all the other spheres of economic activity
as well.''
   Yeutter said he hoped such a gloomy development does not emerge
and that ``we're certainly going to go to Brussels next week with
an open mind'' for the final showdown.
   But he added: ``We're not going to negotiate with ourselves in
Brussels next week. We're not going to come back with an agreement
that we do not believe is in the best interests of this country.
And I'm certainly not going to come back with an agreement that I
do not believe is in the best interest of American agriculture.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged from an
all-day parliamentary session in a jovial mood Tuesday, and told
reporters a joke about the faltering Soviet economy.
   ``I can't really tell it with ladies present,'' Gorbachev teased
journalists in a Kremlin loby after a meeting of the Congress of
Peoples' Deputies of the Russian Federation.
   ``Oh, go ahead,'' said women reporters and lawmakers.
   Gorbachev grinned and proceeded with a joke about himself,
French President Francois Mitterrand and President Bush.
   ``They say that Mitterrand has 100 lovers. One has AIDS, but he
doesn't know which one,'' said Gorbachev.
   ``Bush has 100 bodyguards. One is a terrorist, but he doesn't
know which one.
   ``Gorbachev has 100 economic advisers. One is smart, but he
doesn't know which one,'' the Soviet president said.
   The joke was warmly received by the Russian Federation
lawmakers, some of whom have criticized Gorbachev for his faltering
steps toward shifting the Soviet Union from a centrally planned to
a market economy.

<HEAD>Weather Blows Hot and Cold; Snow in Colorado, Tornadoes in
Missouri</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms battered portions of the Great Plains and the Rockies on
Tuesday while other parts of the nation basked in record warmth.
Tornadoes ripped up buildings and downed power lines in Missouri.
   It looked like winter in Colorado, where more than a foot of
snow fell in some places and Denver commuter traffic was slowed to
a slushy crawl. It felt like summer in Charleston, W.V., where
Christmas shoppers could roll up their sleeves in 84-degree warmth.
   ``I love it,'' said Becky Vandergriff of Dunbar, W.V., as she
looked at Christmas decorations in downtown Charleston. ``The
decorations look just as pretty when it's warm.''
   Missy Frerichs, a transplanted midwesterner, said the balmy
weather ``takes some of the fun out of shopping. ... I just want
some snow.''
   Colorado was the place for Ms. Frerichs, although parts of North
Dakota and Wyoming might have sufficed. A strong weather front
brought freezing rain, snow and icy blasts of wind across an area
extending from the Great Lakes to the Rockies.
   The Beaver Creek ski resort in Colorado reported receiving 14
inches of snow overnight. The Colorado State Patrol said roads
across the state were snowpacked and icy. The storm followed a
weekend of record-breaking temperatures that rose into the 70s in
some spots.
   A tornado tore through a shopping center and at least two
apartment buildings in Columbia, Mo., 30 miles north of the
capital, Jefferson City.
   ``We understand that the roof of the shopping center is pretty
heavily damaged, plus the roofs and windows of several apartment
complexes,'' said Michael Sanford, Columbia's director of emergency
management.
   About 70 miles southwest of Columbia, a similar storm downed
trees and power lines and ripped up a boat storage area near the
Ozark town of Warsaw.
   A storm that may have been a tornado struck O'Fallon, Mo., about
30 miles west of St. Louis, downing power lines and trees and
damaging some homes and a boat.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries in any of the
Missouri storms.
   The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of
tornadoes from Texas to Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.
   In Illinois, thunderstorms and possible tornadoes wrecked homes
and businesses, toppled trees and knocked out electrical service to
thousands of people. The damage Monday night and Tuesday was
scattered throughout the state.
   No injuries were reported.
   The roof on an apartment complex in Aurora was lifted and a car
was overturned in the parking lot of a shopping center in the
Chicago suburb of Naperville.
   In much of Michigan and Indiana, however, the weather talk was
about warmth - the record of 66 degrees in Detroit, or the records
of 65 degrees in Fort Wayne, Ind., or 65 degrees in Grand Rapids,
Mich.

   China's foreign minister will make an official
visit to Washington on Friday, the first such encounter here since
before China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June
1989.
   But the State Department said the visit does not signal any
change in the U.S. policy of barring high level exchanges with
China. The policy does not preclude contacts but does rule out
exchanges of a ``formal and ceremonial nature,'' a spokesman said.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will be in New York on Wednesday
and Thursday for the U.N. Security Council deliberations on the
Persian Gulf. He will travel to Washington on Friday. On Monay,
China announced that a vice minister of trade will visit Washington
next month.
   As a member of the Security Council, China has been the target
of a U.S. campaign for support for a resolution authorizing the use
of force against Kuwait. It reportedly has agreed to support the
proposal, along with the four other permanent Council members.
   ``China's vote on the U.N. Security Council resolution will be
based on its own national interest determination,'' said State
Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``To date, China has consistently held to the Security Council
consensus on the gulf crisis and has voted for every one of the 10
Security Council resolutions on Iraq's continuing aggression.''
   Boucher said that since the June 1989 rights crackdown, there
have been four meetings between Qian and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. There were two in New York, one in Paris and one
three weeks ago in Cairo.
   ``While Minister Qian is in Washington we intend to explore ways
to strengthen cooperation on global and regional issues and seek
understandings on ways to achieve improvement in bilateral
relations, including further progress in the area of human rights
that would permit a gradual return to normal high-level
exchanges,'' Boucher said.
   He said the U.S. approach is consistent with the policies of the
European Community, Japan, and other friends and allies.
   The types of bilateral gatherings which no longer take place,
Boucher said, include cabinet level exchanges under the Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade, and the Joint Economic
Commission. High-level military exchanges continue to be banned as
well. In addition, U.S. companies which invest in China are
ineligible for a U.S. government insurance program that protects
such investments.
   Boucher cited China's recent decision to place sedition charges
against two dissident journalists as a motivation for ``speaking
directly to Chinese officials about our human rights concerns.''
   One of the dissidents was the publisher of the now-banned
Economic Studies Weekly and the other was the editor. They were
charged with plotting to overthrow the government, a crime
punishable by death.

   Bulgaria's government of former
Communists began talks with opposition leaders Tuesday on resolving
the standoff over how to run this Balkan country of 9 million
people, state television said.
   They met during the nation's worst political and economic crisis
and on the second day of a general strike meant to bring down
Premier Andrei Lukanov's Socialist government, made up of members
of the renamed Communist Party.
   Petar Beron, chairman of the main opposition alliance, the Union
of Democratic Forces, said Tuesday the UDF would urge an end to the
strike because of the agreement to talk with the government, the
state news agency BTA reported. Beron's group had given the strike
lukewarm support earlier.
   Podkrepa, the opposition labor federation, called the walkout
and said in a broadcast statement Tuesday that 790,000 Bulgarians
were on strike, including 220,000 in Sofia.
   Podkrepa spokesman Kiril Vladimirov said large trucks blocked
several intersections in downtown Sofia early Tuesday in solidarity
with the strikers.
   Police used tear gas to disperse the truckers and students who
also blocked streets with sit-in strikes, he said.
   But government representative Danail Danailov said the number of
strikers had not grown from Monday and actually declined in places.
The main union organization did not support the strike, although
some of its members took part.
   In Bulgaria, electricity and many goods are rationed or
unavailable, and many people have become impatient with the
political infighting.
   After the walkout began Monday, BTA reported about 500,000
workers - or roughly 11 percent of the work force - were on strike.
The government said only one worker out of 100 struck.
   Leaders of the Socialist Party and the UDF had met late Monday
at the suggestion of President Zhelyu Zhelev to try to ease the
deadlock.
   ``These were the most constructive consultations in the last few
months,'' UDF deputy chairman Dimitar Ludzhev told radio later.
   Chavdar Kyuranov, deputy chairman of the Socialist Party, said
both sides agreed to set up a group representing the various
political parties to work out what he called ``a draft political
accord.''
   Opposition leaders said the accord should also involve trade
unions and should set a timetable for key economic and
constitutional reforms.
   The major obstacle appeared to be an opposition demand that it
hold the prime minister's job. It claims a swing in its favor
following June elections in which the Socialists gained 211 of 400
seats in Parliament.
   An opposition representative, speaking Tuesday on condition of
anonymity, said Lukanov now seems ready to step down if this could
be done ``in a dignified manner.''
   The crisis has been complicated by splits within Socialist and
opposition ranks.
   At a seven-hour meeting Tuesday of its leadership and
parliamentary bloc of 144 deputies, the UDF failed to agree on a
common stand in Parliament.
   The alliance walked out of Parliament after Lukanov narrowly
survived a no-confidence vote Friday.

   Toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain and, if you
believe the myth, you'll come back to Rome some day. But if you're
a pigeon, you might not want to return to the Baroque monument.
   A low-voltage electronic field to repel pigeons has been
installed at the fountain, following a two-year, $2.8-million
scrubbing project, city art officials said Tuesday.
   The wires don't harm the birds, but emit enough current to
discourage them from setting on the fountain. A similar system has
been used successfully for several years on Milan's spire-topped
cathedral to keep birds' excrement from collecting.
   According to Rome's superintendency of art and antiquities,
restoration of the fountain will be completed in early 1991. Trevi
receives its water via the same aqueduct that supplied Roman baths
in the days of the emperors, but that water is heavy in calcium,
which forms crusty deposits on the monuments. Restorers are now
working out a treatment system to reduce the deposits.
   The fountain, dominated by a giant figure of the sea god Neptune
on a winged chariot, has been a backdrop in many films, including
``La Dolce Vita.''

   Nearly 40 relatives of Americans held hostage in
Iraq met with State Department officials Tuesday in sometimes
heated discussions about the Bush administration's policies in the
Persian Gulf.
   Daryl Watley, son of hostage Donald Watley, said talks were
tense as some family members argued about Bush's decision to send
an additional 200,000 troops to the region to provide an
``offensive military option.''
   Relatives often ``disagreed with the hotheadedness of the Bush
administration's policies'' and the rapid escalation toward war.
   In the fifth of seven sessions with families nationwide, State
Department officials avoided discussing Bush's policies and
discouraged family members from visiting Iraq, said Watley, who is
from Tomball.
   For many of the hostages' families, the main topic was whether
to go to Baghdad to help free their loved ones following the
release Tuesday of three American hostages whose wives had come to
visit them.
   ``They just said that after you leave Amman, Jordan, they can't
ensure your safety,'' said Lynda Parker, who still plans to visit
her husband, hostage Bobbie Parker.
   ``My children need their father home,'' said Mrs. Parker, who
lives in Vidor. ``I am going with the assumption I will get him. If
that's my only chance to get my husband back, I will risk it.''
   Freed Americans whose families had pleaded with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein for their release told reporters at the Amman
airport that the Bush administration had ignored their plight.
   ``I was not released with help from my government,'' said John
Stevenson of Panama City, Fla. ``It was my family who did it.''
   ``It's a very difficult decision for anyone to make,'' said Bill
Schaub, OGE Drilling's coordinator for Kuwait, after the meeting
ended. Schaub's company has six employees held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Women want to do anything they can to help their husbands, but
it's risky and the husbands don't always want them to come. They're
also worried that they may play into the hands of the Iraqis by
going,'' he said.
   Most of the families of hostages taken since Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2 refused to talk to reporters as they left the meeting,
which began Monday.
   Donnita Cole of Odessa said she plans to visit Iraq next week
and was heartened by the release of the Americans on Tuesday. She
is the wife of hostage Johnny Cole.
   ``Fantastic!'' she said. ``I mean, it's the best news since the
invention of peanut butter as far as I'm concerned.''

   Kuwaiti refugees told the U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday that Iraqi invaders have turned the conquered
emirate into a living hell of murder, torture, rape and pillage.
   An infant's head crushed under a soldier's boot, a retarded girl
gang-raped by soldiers, babies torn from incubators and from their
mothers' arms and mass graves for babies were stark images in the
testimony delivered by four men and two women.
   The nearly two-hour session covered atrocities and the
destruction of Kuwait's economy and infrastructure. It was a
prelude to Thursday's meeting, when the council is expected to
authorize the use of military force to liberate Kuwait if Iraq does
not withdraw by Jan. 15.
   At Tuesday's session, the Kuwaiti refugees, including doctors, a
nurse, a grandmother and businessmen, appealed to the council not
to let their homeland's identity be obliterated.
   All but one of those testifying, an Indian national, said they
dared not use their full names for fear of reprisal against family
and friends still in Kuwait.
   During the presentation to the 15-member council, some in the
audience winced at the grisly presentation. Large photographs of
the dead, the tortured and dying were displayed in the chamber.
   Witnesses wept as they spoke of a resistance fighter whose eyes
were plucked out and badly beaten prisoners forced to soak their
wounds in salt water.
   ``It is our fervent hope that everything you have heard and seen
will further prompt you for action, decisive action, which will
contribute to the maintenance of just peace, to be defended without
reservation and irrespective of sacrifices to be made,'' Kuwaiti
Ambassador Mohammad A. Abulhasan told the council.
   Witnesses, presenting both eyewitness and hearsay accounts, told
of patients disconnected from life-support machines that then were
shipped to Iraq, severly handicapped patients turned out into the
streets, infants and toddlers forced to give their blood to Iraqi
soldiers.
   One man, who used the name Dr. Essa Ibrahim, said he saw four
Kuwaiti doctors shot because their Iraqi soldier patients died. He
said another was killed because he refused to shut off an old
woman's life-support system.
   ``Under my supervision, 120 newborn babies were buried in the
second week of the invasion,'' he said. ``I myself buried 40
newborns, who had been taken from their incubators by soldiers.''
   While there was no immediate comment from Iraq on Tuesday, Iraqi
authorities in the past have denied reports of Kuwaiti atrocities,
in particular those of babies taken from incubators.
   The U.N. witnesses also described the systematic looting of
their wealthy nation, the dismantling of factories, schools and
telecommunications systems and the theft of priceless art objects.
   Kuwait has submitted a draft resolution condemning Iraq's
attempts to alter the demographics of Kuwait by forcing Kuwaitis to
flee, destroying identity papers of Kuwaitis and encouraging mass
resettlement by Iraqis.
   The government calls on the U.N. secretary-general to take
custody of a copy of the national population register containing
the names of all Kuwaiti citizens as of Aug. 1, the day before the
invasion. The resolution is expected to be adopted this week.
   The meeting was delayed when Cuba, Yemen and Malaysia demanded
an immediate vote on a Palestine Liberation Organization-backed
resolution calling for deployment of U.N. observers to protect
Palestinians and for a meeting to help safeguard Palestinians'
rights.
   The United States was considered likely to veto the resolution,
but wanted to put the issue off until after a vote on the measure
authorizing the use of force to free Kuwait. A date for a meeting
and vote on the Israeli-occupied territories has not been set.

   Jewish leaders reacted angrily Tuesday to
two temple firebombings, the latest in a two-week wave of hate
crimes.
   Police said it was too early to tell whether the attacks on
Jewish gathering places in the San Francisco area were related.
   ``It's sick and it's sick people who do this,'' said Dave Karp,
mayor of San Leandro and a member of the Beth Sholom temple, which
was firebombed Monday.
   Rabbi Ira Book of Beth Sholom said there was fear among his
congregation. Damage from the bomb was limited to a broken window
and some scorched floor tiles.
   ``Most of the reaction, however, was anger that it could happen
in this day and age,'' Book said.
   The firebombing at the temple in San Leandro, about 20 miles
east of San Francisco, occurred about a half hour after a firebomb
was tossed into the Temple Beth Abraham, about 10 miles away in
Oakland. That bomb burned a carpet and damaged a wall.
   Last week, firebombs were tossed at the Jewish Community Center
and Congregation Beth Israel, both in San Francisco. The week
before that, police said, three shots were fired at Beth Israel's
windows. The synagogue was firebombed in August.
   The damage in all the attacks was minor and there were no
injuries. Police said the temples did not receive threats or
warnings and there were no anti-Semitic graffiti or messages.
   While temple members said they believed the bombings were part
of a string of anti-Jewish acts, law enforcement officials said
they had not made a definite link.
   ``It's a little too early to make any determination,'' said Ed
Gleba, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
which was examining bomb parts recovered from the latest incidents.
   Karp said police in Oakland, San Francisco and San Leandro were
sharing information but had only slim leads.
   Scott Ury of the Anti-Defamation League, a group that tracks
anti-Semitic activities, said he wasn't surprised by the attacks.
He said such incidents have reached record levels in the San
Francisco Bay area.
   In 1988, the ADL counted 25 incidents of harassment, assault and
attempted firebombings on Jews or their institutions in the San
Francisco area. In 1989, the number was 48 - the highest number
since the ADL began its count 11 years ago.
   ``And 1990 is unfortunately already above the 1989 level,'' Ury
said. ``This makes 54 incidents, and we have another month to go.''
   The City Council in San Leandro doesn't meet until Dec. 17, but
Karp was busy Tuesday contacting council members, urging that a
special meeting be held to approve the posting of a reward.
   The Alameda County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a
$5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of those responsible. The ADL has also offered a $2,000 reward.
   Rabbi Joseph Schonwald of Temple Beth Abraham said the rewards
were important to demonstrate ``that the whole community, not just
the Jewish community, cares. It sends a message that this won't be
tolerated.''

   The Conservative Party elected John Major as their
leader, but only Queen Elizabeth II can make him prime minister.
   The queen certainly will confirm the treasury chief on Wednesday
morning in a private audience at Buckingham Palace.
   Also Wedesday, outgoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will
leave 10 Downing St. for the last time and meet with the queen
alone.
   About 45 minutes after Mrs. Thatcher drives away, Major will be
admitted to the same room on the second floor of the palace for a
private audience.
   The room has walls of duck-egg blue and cream silk curtains.
There are two paintings of Venetian views by Antonio Canaletto and
two portraits by Thomas Gainsborough of King George III - who lost
the American colonies - and his consort Queen Charlotte.
   During Mrs. Thatcher's 11{ years as prime minister, she met the
queen most Tuesdays to inform her about government business.
   ``The new prime minister takes on the post from the moment of
the audience,'' said Geoffrey de Deney, clerk of the Privy Council,
a body of nearly 400 royal advisers.
   According to tradition, the new head of government kisses the
hands of the monarch - the head of state - and receives the seals
of office.
   ``As the audience is private and confidential we won't know
whether there is any kissing of hands or hand and there are no
seals of office for a prime minister - there never were,'' de Deney
said.
   It is the title of first lord of the Treasury, not prime
minister, that will give Major the right to live at 10 Downing St.
   Deney said it is a ``firm convention'' that conversation with
the monarch at a private audience is never repeated.
   ``The convention has not always been observed in the memoirs of
some former Cabinet ministers,'' he added.
   As chancellor of the exchequer, Major's official title as
Treasury chief in Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet, his official
residence has been 11 Downing St.
   After seeing the queen, Major will move next door to No. 10 to
start forming his Cabinet.
   Mrs. Thatcher will go to her new house in Dulwich, a southeast
London suburb.
   Major's annual salary as prime minister will be $131,700, up
from $108,800 he received as treasury chief. He is due for a raise
to $142,900 on Jan. 1.
   Mrs. Thatcher chose to draw the same salary as her fellow
Cabinet ministers, forgoing the extra for prime minister.
   Her salary will now fall to that of a rank-and-file House of
Commons member, $52,600 then to $57,000 in January.
   The governing powers of the British monarchy, in practice, have
been assumed by Parliament since the early 19th century, but
sovereignty remains with the throne.
   ``Under the royal powers, Major could appear at the palace to be
told by the queen that she had chosen someone else as prime
minister,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, an expert on British royalty
and publishing director of Burke's Peerage.
   ``The result would be the most terrible turmoil. It would be
amusing but impractical, although perfectly possible,'' he said.

   Americans set a long-distance calling record
this week that broke the one set the day after last year's San
Francisco earthquake, AT&amp;T said Tuesday.
   American Telephone and Telegraph has only theories to explain
why 148.4 million long-distance calls were made on its lines
Monday.
   On Oct. 18, 1989, the day after the San Francisco earthquake,
AT&amp;T handled some 144.7 million long-distance calls, said spokesman
Herb Linnen said. On an average day, the company handles 115
million to 120 million calls.
   ``Traditionally, the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend is
busy, although there has never been one like this,'' Linnen said.
``It was the busiest calling day in the history of AT&amp;T.''
   Linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on
business, or perhaps discussing the the possibility of war with
Iraq.
   But then there were a lot of calls to toll-free ``800'' numbers,
and that could mean people were doing more Christmas shopping by
phone, he said.
   AT&amp;T handles 70 percent or more of the nation's long-distance
calls. There was no similar announcement from the other two major
long-distance companies, US Sprint and MCI, and no answer at their
Washington offices.

<HEAD>French Officials Say Troops in Chad Facing Strong Rebel Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops in Chad suffered substantial
losses in battles with rebels waging one of the most serious
challenges to President Hissene Habre since a 1987 Libyan invasion,
French officials said Tuesday.
   The officials described the 2-week-old desert war in eastern
Chad as an internal conflict, contradicting claims by Chad's
government that the rebels are mercenaries backed by Libya and
Sudan.
   Libya and Sudan deny involvement.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said both government
and rebels suffered significant casualties. Without giving figures,
he said government losses were ``notable.''
   Another French authority, speaking on condition of anonymity,
talked of the seriousness of the rebel challenge. The source said
there appeared no overt Libyan or Sudanese role in the fighting.
   The daily Le Figaro said 1,270 troops were killed by rebels in
one battle.
   It said rebels led by Habre's former military adviser, Idriss
Deby, massacred a column of Chadian troops in bloody weekend
fighting. Habre had gone to the front to take personal command of
his troops and almost was captured in fighting along the border
with Sudan, according to Le Figaro.
   Chad's information minister, Adoum Moussa Seif, said Tuesday
that Habre was in the capital, N'Djamena. He refused comment on
reports that the president had gone to the front.
   Chad's embassy in Paris said Habre was ``in complete control of
the political and military situation throughout the country.''
   Le Figaro said the rebels trapped a mechanized column of 5,000
troops near Iriba.
   With loyalist forces bogged down in a minefield, guerrillas of
Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement opened fire with heavy machine
guns and anti-tank rockets, killing 1,270 men, Le Figaro said.
   Surviving government forces fled, Le Figaro quoted the rebels as
saying, leaving behind 20 destroyed armored vehicles, 200 light
trucks equipped with machine guns, and 12 heavy trucks.
   Among the captured vehicles were two air-conditioned command
cars apparently belonging to Habre, Le Figaro said.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed, but were the
most detailed since renewed fighting in the Chad civil war broke
out Nov. 10.
   Government radio claimed Monday that loyalist troops had retaken
the towns of Iriba, Guereda and Adre, but the rebels claimed
victories at Iriba and Tine.
   Chad claims that Libya supports the insurgents. Libya denies it,
claiming th problems is among Chadians.
   Deby, who helped Habre take power in 1982, was accused in April
1989 of involvement in a coup plot and fled to Sudan.
   Libya, which once occupied the northern half of the country,
signed a peace treaty with Chad in 1989, despite an outstanding
border dispute.
   France maintains a force of about 1,000 soldiers in Chad as part
of a defense agreement with its former colony. About half the
troops are deployed in Abeche, about 150 miles south of the combat
zone.
   Bernard said France has no intentions of entering the conflict.
   The rebels are based in Sudan's sparsely populated Darfur
province in Sudan, over which Sudanese authorities exercise little
Control.

   Claims about accident rates and performance
problems used to justify pre-employment drug screening may be
exaggerated, say medical researchers who studied thousands of
postal workers.
   The study didn't distinguish between occasional drug users and
chronic abusers, who almost certainly would xxhibit problems at
higher rates, said a drug-abuse specialist not involved in the
study.
   ``Drug users have been reported to be involved in 200 percent to
300 percent more industrial accidents, to sustain 400 percent more
compensable injuries and to use 1,500 percent more sick leave,''
the researchers said.
   But the study's findings suggest many such estimates used to
justify pre-employment drug screening have been exaggerated, the
researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   ``We found that those with marijuana-positive urine samples have
55 percent more industrial accidents, 85 percent more injuries and
a 78 percent increase in absenteeism,'' the researchers wrote.
   For those with cocaine-positive urine samples, there was a 145
percent increase in absenteeism and an 85 percent increase in
injuries, they said.
   The researchers cited as examples of exaggerated accidents rates
a 1986 manual from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and
articles in the journal Psychiatry Letter and the American
Psychologist.
   Peter Bensinger, a consultant on workplace drug and alcohol
abuse, wrote one of the articles. He said he stands by his figures.
   ``We have clients who had great reductions in absenteeism,
accidents with drug testing,'' Bensinger said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle wrote the American Psychologist
article in 1983, when he was a senator.
   The lead researcher for the AMA journal study was Dr. Craig
Zwerling, former medical director at the U.S. Postal Service in
Boston and now with the University of Iowa College of Medicine at
Iowa City.
   He and his colleagues performed urine drug tests on almost 5,000
job applicants in Boston for positions of letter carrier, postal
clerk, computer-forwarding system clerk and maintenance worker,
including skilled technical worker.
   The study's authors tracked the new hires between 1986 and 1989
to compile data for their report.
   The marijuana test was sensitive for up to four weeks after use;
the test for cocaine was sensitive up to 72 hours after use.
Positive tests were confirmed, and only confirmed tests were
reported.
   Of the 2,537 new hires, 2,229, or 87.9 percent, tested negative;
198, or 7.8 percent, were confirmed positive for marijuana; 55, or
2.2 percent, confirmed positive for cocaine; and 55, or 2.2 percent
confirmed positive for other ``non-therapeutic'' drugs or multiple
drugs, the study found.
   But nothing in their protocol distinguished the occasional user
from the chronic abuser, said an editorial accompanying the study.
   ``Postal employees in the sample were classified as
drug-involved solely on the basis of a single pre-employment urine
test,'' said Eric D. Wish of the Center for the Prevention and
Control of Substance Abuse at the University of Maryland in College
   Wish said if the researchers could have differentiated between
employees with chronic abuse problems from those who were
infrequent users, the observed differences in job performance would
have been larger.
   Regardless, he said, the overall rate of drug abuse was small -
12 percent, two-thirds of which was marijuana use. Such a rate is
dwarfed by the 50 percent to 60 percent rates of abuse among people
arrested for drug and non-drug crimes, he said.
   Wish suggested that society may benefit more by investing
resources in testing and treating drug abusers coming through the
criminal justice system than in finding the comparatively small
number of mostly marijuana users in ``the primarily law-abiding
employee populations.''

   Three professional athletes were fined a total
of $22,500 Tuesday by the National Football League for taking part
in the sexual harassment of a female reporter in their locker room.
   In addition, the New England Patriots was ordered to pay $25,000
for instructional materials on how to deal responsibly with the
news media and $25,000 because they ``never vigorously sought the
facts about what had happened,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
wrote in a letter to Patriots owner Victor Kiam.
   The Sept. 17 incident involved reporter Lisa Olson of the Boston
Herald and Patriots players Zeke Mowatt, Michael Timpson and former
Patriot Robert Perryman.
   Mowatt was fined $12,500 for verbally harassing Olson and
exposing himself to her, the NFL said. Timpson and Perryman each
were fined $5,000. Timpson was accused of shouting encouragement
and Perryman was accused of exposing himself.
   None of the players was suspended.
   The fines were levied by Tagliabue after special counsel Phillip
Heymann of the Harvard Law School submitted a 60-page report.
Tagliabue called the players' actions and statements ``completely
uncalled for and improper.''
   Kiam, who has been widely criticized for playing down the
incident, said the team would abide by Tagliabue's judgment.
   ``We regret that the incident occurred,'' Kiam added. ``The team
and I had previously expressed our apologies and we repeat them
once again. The decision has been rendered. Now it's time to get on
with playing football.''
   The team said the players would have no comment.
   Perryman, who has since gone to the Dallas Cowboys, denied to
investigators any involvement in the incident, the report said.
   Olson, who now covers the Boston Celtics, said: ``My
satisfaction with the investigation and subsequent sanctions is
surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful incident had never
occurred in the first place.''

speech and shaking limbs, used hand signals to communicate with
Jaber Mohammed, who speaks for him.
   Ali won the championship with a first-round knockout of Sonny
Liston on May 25, 1965. Ali then defended the crown eight times
until he was stripped of the title in 1967 after being convicted of
draft evasion for refusing induction into the Army.
   The New York State Athletic Commission returned his license on
Sept. 28, 1970. He defended the title 10 times before retiring in
1981 with a 56-5 record.

   Winter-like weather Tuesday replaced mild temperatures enjoyed
by much of the nation' heartland for several days.
   A fast moving cold front pushing high winds and thunderstorms
left rapidly falling temperatures, snow and freezing rain in its
wake.
   Strong thunderstorms that developed along and ahead of the front
marched across the lower and middle Mississippi Valley. Severe
thunderstorms over central Missouri spawned two tornadoes in
Columbia and just north of Warsaw.
   About 20 people suffered minor injuries in O'Fallon, 30 miles
west of St. Louis.
   The thunderstorms produced high winds in Greene County that blew
down trees and blew a car off the road.
   As the damaging storms moved out of Missouri into west central
Illinois, they produced high winds in Sterling and downed trees
around Barry and Rushville.
   Strong thunderstorms and locally heavy rain were scattered from

   A Peruvian Air Force search helicopter on
Tuesday discovered a Swiss adventurer at the edge of the Apurimac
River, a week after a boating accident in the jungled highland
region.
   The French Embassy on Tuesday said a French member of the
rafting expedition had found his way back to Cuzco, a mountain city
350 miles southeast of Lima. Two Frenchmen remain missing, the
embassy said.
   Both men were in excellent condition, an Embassy spokesman said.
The two were taking part in a 10-man, private expedition when their
rubber rafts capsized Nov. 20 in the rain-swollen Apurimac. The
accident took place near Curahuasi, 40 miles southwest of Cuzco.
   The Frenchman told reporters he was lost in the jungle for two
days before he came upon a group of peasants who took him to a
road, where he caught a truck to Cuzco, he said.
   The embassy spokesman said searchers hope to find the other two
men safe. He speculated they may have walked into the jungle
looking for a road or settlement.
   The embassy has expressed fear the explorers may be captured by
leftist guerrillas operating in the region.
   The Maoist Shining Path has killed at least 12 foreigners the
last two years as part of a decade-long insurgency against the
government.

<HEAD>Israeli Government Approves Additional Taxation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday approved an increase
in taxes proposed by Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai to cover the
growing defense and immigrant absorption budgets.
   The decision came at a special Cabinet session called to debate
the $37.5 billion state budget for 1991.
   The budget for the nine-month fiscal year, which starts in April
and ends in December, is expected to allocate $6.2 billion for
defense and $6.5 billion for the absorption of Soviet Jews.
   About 130,000 Soviet immigrants have arrived in the country this
year, and an additional 350,000 to 400,000 are expected to come in
1991.
   On Tuesday, Modai and Defense Minister Moshe Arens agreed after
a bitter debate to an additional defense budget of $240 million for
military needs linked to the nearly three-year-old Palestinian
uprising and the army's continuing state of alert over the Gulf
crisis.
   The Cabinet then voted to accept a new proposal by Modai,
setting the value-added tax at 18 percent, compared with the
present rate of 16 percent.
   In addition, it approved a proposal to impose a special five
percent hike in income taxes.
   Modai, speaking on Israel television, said the measures will
take effect between Jan. 1 and April 1, 1991.
   There was no decision on the overall budget, which also has to
be approved by the 120-member parliament. However, the government
enjoys a Parliament majority.
   The Histadrut, Israel's largest trade unions' federation,
announced Tuesday that it plans to fight against the new measures
and said it will stage a countrywide general strike next Sunday.

<HEAD>Rock Star Raises $1.3 Million for Brazilian Indian Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock star Sting announced Tuesday that
his Virgin Forest Foundation had collected $1.3 million toward the
creation of the largest Indian reserve in Brazil.
   Sting told reporters he had come to Brazil to meet with the
foundation's leaders and to account for donations raised since the
group was founded in March 1989.
   The foundation is seeking to join five National Parks stretching
from the central Amazon state of Mato Grosso to the northern Amazon
state of Para to form a 30-million-acre Indian reserve.
   Sting said the money would also be used for education, health
and Indian cultural projects on the reserve.
   Foundation president Olimpio Serra said the donations had been
deposited in a foreign bank account and would be transferred to
Brazil's National Indian Foundation when the government authorized
the demarcation of the reserve.
   Serra said $250,000 in donations had been blocked in Brazil's
Central Bank since March 16, when President Fernando Collor de
Mello froze 80 percent of all money in circulation to curb
four-digit annual inflation.
   The Virgen Forest Foundation was founded after Sting began a
world tour in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe to raise
money for the project.

   Conservative lawmakers heard the vote count,
roared their approval, then wondered what they had done.
   More than 100 Tory lawmakers crowded into a committee room at
the House of Commons to hear the totals in the leadership race:
John Major 185, Michael Heseltine 131, Douglas Hurd 56.
   Their delighted bellowing reverberated through the ancient
wood-paneled corridors of the Palace of Westminster, home of both
houses of the British parliament.
   But wait - nobody won. Major was two votes short of the majority
needed.
   ``We were starting to bang the tables, as we do on occasions
like this, but then we held our hands back as we realized what had
happened,'' said legislator David Shaw.
   ``One hundred and eighty-five sounded like an outright victory,
but then we remembered the reality of the numbers.''
   Then, as they surged out into the corridor to meet waiting
reporters, legislators learned that former Defense Secretary
Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Hurd had conceded defeat.
   A week ago, many of these same Tories produced a split vote that
toppled Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   It had been a heady two weeks for the backbenchers, as the
rank-and-file legislators are known. Most of the time, they vote as
they are told by leaders. But in the leadership election, they had
a secret ballot and were avidly courted by all three camps.
   Lawmaker Jeremy Hanley said the wooing could have been more
intense. ``I had to pay for my own lunch,'' he said. ``They can't
be that keen.''
   The result capped a day of buzzing activity in the usually
sedate committee corridor, a long walkway leading to dozens of
committee rooms where the day-to-day business of Parliament is
done.
   Early voters at Committee Room 12 included Hurd, a part-time
writer of fiction, who quipped that the three-way tussle for the
leadership ``has given me a plot for my next novel.''
   Major flashed an enigmatic smile, and said nothing.
   Heseltine, voting shortly after lunch time, teased the media by
reporting: ``I confirm that at 2:13 p.m. I had three votes, because
I have two proxies.''
   Mrs. Thatcher cast her vote after making her 698th appearance at
Question Time, when she fields queries from lawmakers. She took
7,501 questions in her 11{ years as the head of the government.
   Whoever the lawmakers supported, they all said afterward that
the party would go forward united behind Major.
   That's exactly as predicted earlier this week by Lord St. John
of Fawsley, a former Conservative member of the House of Commons.
   Tories believe in unity, Lord St. John said. They would support
Major, Hurd or Heseltine.
   ``They'd rally around a broomstick,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Says Panama Atrocity Claims Unfounded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Army officials said there was no
evidence to support a former senator's allegations that atrocities
were committed by U.S. forces whenthey ousted Manuel Noriega from
Panama last year.
   Col. Joseph S. Panvini, director of public affairs for the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama, said allegations that U.S. forces paid
$6 per body and buried slain noncombatants in mass, unmarked graves
was ``absolutely unfounded.''
   He said there was no evidence to support other allegations made
by former U.S. Sen. Donald Stewart of Alabama. Stewart toured
Panama in late August.
   Stewart said about 100 Panamanians he spoke with told ``story
after story'' of innocent citizens, including children and the
elderly, being killed and buried in mass graves. He said official
figures on casualties appeared to be far short of the actual
numbers.
   ``There has been no attempt on the part of the U.S. government
to hide the reporting of Panamanian fatalities as a result of
Operation Just Cause,'' Panvini said in a letter responding to the
allegations.
   ``Panvini is saying things contrary to what the people in Panama
told me,'' Stewart said in a telephone interview. ``If they don't
have anything to cover up, an investigation will reveal that. I
would love to know it wasn't true.''
   As for Panvini's denial of the $6-per-body claim, Stewart said,
``He may be absolutely correct that they didn't pay $6 a body, but
that was what I was told by more than one Panamanian.''
   Stewart toured Panama in late August on a trip related to
mission work with the United Methodist Church. He said he hopes for
a congressional investigation into the claims.
   Stewart, an Anniston lawyer, won a special election to fill a
Senate vacancy in 1978 but lost in the Democratic primary seeking a
full term in 1980. After his six-day trip to Panama, he told
Methodist church officials that he received ``report after report
of those who saw the atrocities.''
   Panvini said that since Jan. 11, inquiries concerning casualties
of the December 1989 operation have been referred to Panama's
Institute of Legal Medicine, similar to a coroner's office. He said
that as of Nov. 7, that agency had identified 65 military and 155
civilian remains, with another 50 bodies not yet identified. He
said some of the 50 may be among the 75 unsolved reports of missing
persons.
   Prior to Jan. 11, he said, the Southern Command, in conjunction
with the agency, estimated there were 202 civilian fatalities. He
said it also estimated 315 military fatalities, based on reports
from combat units.
   Stewart said such figures on civilian deaths do not correspond
with the accounts given to him by Panamanians.
   As for mass graves, Panvini said 123 Panamanian nationals were
buried in a common grave at Panama City and 18 were buried at
Colon. He said the burials and the previously reported exhumations
were conducted by Panamanian authorities, not by U.S. personnel.
   Stewart, however, said Panamanians told him the interments in
the common, unmarked graves were paid for by U.S. authorities.
Panvini did not immediately return a telephone call concerning that
allegation.
   In his Nov. 21 letter, Panvini said: ``Regarding alleged
atrocities by U.S. forces, only 24 reports of alleged misconduct by
U.S. troops during Operation Just Cause have been received by U.S.
military authorities. All 24 have been investigated.''
   As of Aug. 31, he said, the Army review cleared nine and found
the remaining 15 ``warranted formal review by the Department of the
Army.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, facing the House
of Commons while her colleagues voted for her successor, said that
her 698th appearance for Question Time on Tuesday would be her
last.
   ``I don't believe in making a career of positively last
appearances,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, who announced last week she
would resign after 11{ years in power.
   She wished her successor well and predicted: ``I am sure he will
continue the policies which have been so successful for Britain and
he will continue to defeat socialism.''
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party and her
principal antagonist for the last eight years, asked Mrs. Thatcher
``which of the policies that you leave to your successor you now
think should be scrapped?''
   Mrs. Thatcher replied: ``I am happy that my successor will carry
on the excellent policies that have finished with the decline of
socialism and brought great prosperity to this country, which have
raised Britain's standing in the world and brought about a truly
capital-owning democracy.''
   She told another questioner that since she became prime minister
in 1979, she had appeared 698 times in the House of Commons for
Question Time and had fielded 7,498 questions, including his.
   She answered three more before leaving the chamber and going to
a committee room to cast her secret ballot in the Conservative
Party's leadership election.
   Mrs. Thatcher seemed in good spirits but with none of the
exuberant fury unleashed five days earlier, when she led a debate
hours after deciding to resign.
   A Labor legislator asked Mrs. Thatcher whether she found it
``nauseating and hypocritical'' to be praised by her colleagues in
the party, considering what happened to her last week.
   ``No I don't find it nauseating. I find it very refreshing,''
she said.

   A former top federal regulator testified
Tuesday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini improperly offered him a deal on
behalf of savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., and that
three other ``Keating Five'' senators acquiesced in the proposal.
   Edwin J. Gray, a star witness at the Senate Ethics Committee's
hearings into the five senators' relationships with Keating, said
DeConcini's offer at a 1987 meeting will be ``etched in my mind
forever.''
   ``I considered it improper,'' he declared. ``The whole setting
was an intimidating one.''
   He said DeConcini, apparently speaking for the other three
senators as well, asked that regulators not apply to Keating's
embattled Lincoln Savings and Loan Association a rule limiting
risky investments.
   DeConcini, D-Ariz., referred to Keating during the meeting as
``our friend from Lincoln,'' said Gray, the former chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   None of the five senators was present for his testimony.
   Keating was the chairman of the now-failed Lincoln S&amp;L when the
evening meeting took place in DeConcini's office on April 2, 1987.
The committee is trying to decide whether the five senators
intervened improperly for Keating, a political donor who along with
associates contributed $1.3 million to the senators' campaigns and
causes.
   The hearing recessed for the day just after DeConcini's lawyer,
James Hamilton, began cross-examination of Gray. His examination
followed a contentious cross-examination by Thomas Green, lawyer
for Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Charles F. C. Ruff, attorney for Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
briefly questioned Gray; John Dowd, representing Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. declined to cross-examine the witness; and William Taylor,
representing Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., awaited his turn.
   All the senators except Riegle attended the meeting with Gray
and all have denied that a deal was offered for Lincoln - which was
in deep trouble with Gray's regulators.
   Gray testified DeConcini asked that the risky-investment rule
not be applied to Lincoln and added, ``If you do that, we'll get
our friend from Lincoln to make more home loans.''
   ``I said we had gone through the administrative processes and
I'm not going to do that,'' Gray testified. ``He said they were
there for their friend at Lincoln.''
   Gray said, ``We did not succumb to that pressure'' and the
risky-investment rule was not withdrawn. ``Nothing was speeded up
... nothing was slowed down'' in the Lincoln investigation as a
result of the senators' intervention, he said.
   Gray testified he did not protest to the senators after the
alleged deal was offered because he feared they would not back
legislation to provide money-raising authority for the hard-pressed
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Fund.
   Gray was responsible for the fund as chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board.
   Calm under direct examination from special counsel Robert S.
Bennett, the witness whose testimony is crucial to the case not
only insisted that DeConcini offered the deal, but added: ``Every
time he said anything, he said `We.' I assumed he was speaking
for'' Cranston, Glenn and McCain.
   While Riegle was not at that meeting, Gray said the Michigan
Democrat was instrumental in organizing it - something that Riegle,
the Senate Banking Committee chairman has denied.
   Gray said that on March 6, 1987, Riegle told him, ``You know
there are senators out West who are very unhappy about the bank
board's regulation of Lincoln and you ought to talk to them.''
   Gray said he resisted, because he thought the matter was simply
a continuation of Keating accusations that the chief thrift
regulator was out to get Lincoln. Despite that protest, Gray said,
Riegle told him, ``I think you'll be getting a call.''
   The ex-regulator said he was shocked when he learned that Riegle
was at a meeting April 9, 1987, between all five senators and the
San Francisco-based regulators who were examining Lincoln.
   Since Riegle was from Michigan and Lincoln was based in
California, Gray said, ``I couldn't figure out for the life of me
why he would be there.''
   When he later learned from a reporter that shortly before the
meeting Keating had hosted a fund-raising dinner for Riegle, Gray
said his reaction was, ``You've got to be kidding.''
   In his cross-examination, Green read from a news story that
characterized Gray as an autocratic executive who was obsessed with
personal security and argued constantly with his fellow regulators.
   Gray attorney Leonard Garment forced an end to that line of
questioning by protesting to Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. that
Green stop reading from materials not in evidence and accounts with
``lurid'' descriptions.
   Riegle's lawyer also asked the former regulator why he sent the
senator a copy of a transcript of the April 9, 1987 meeting with
the San Francisco regulators, a favor that Gray had not extended to
the other four senators.
   Gray said he acted ``as a matter of courtesy to someone who had
been friendly and sympathetic to me.'' The five senators have said
they had not been aware that a record of the meeting was being kept
by one of the regulators. Gray also said of Riegle, ``I bore no
malice against this man whatsoever.''

<HEAD>Yazov: Troops May Use Force to Defend Military Installations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov on Tuesday said
troops may use force to prevent attacks against soldiers defending
military installations. He also warned that nuclear weapons must
remain under the control of the central government.
   Yazov's statements in a nationally televised address gave new
urgency to tensions in the 15 republics and President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's efforts to hold the splintering Soviet Union together.
   They also appeared to be the toughest official reaction yet to
fears that nuclear weapons could fall into nationalist hands.
   ``Illegal actions in a number of republics ... endanger the
defense capacity of the country,'' he said after the evening news.
   ``In some republics their own army units are being formed.
Voices are heard about handing nuclear weapons over to some
republics. Decisions are taken requiring relocation of armed forces
units, including strategic units,'' Yazov said.
   ``Attempts are made to defame and dishonor officers and
soldiers, (and) members of their families. There are armed assaults
against military installations,'' he said.
   Yazov listed eight points, including one that said nuclear
forces must remain under national control and that the president
has final authority on deployment of troops.
   Earlier this year, a Russian republic deputy prime minister
called for the vast republic to possess its own nuclear weapons,
and some nationalists in the restive southern republics reportedly
have tried to storm nuclear weapons facilities.
   Yazov said commanders of military district around the country
have ``directives to take installations and systems under the guard
and protection of armed units'' if local officials shut off their
water, power or other services.
   He said soldiers have orders to ``use weapons'' if any
serviceman or military installation is attacked. Commanders have
orders to prevent acts of vandalism and ``counteract the
construction of monuments and other forms of glorifying fascists
and their henchmen, (and) eliminate the existing symbols of this
sort,'' he said.
   Hours earlier, Gorbachev used his broad presidential powers to
say he would hold local officials personally responsible for any
failure to register servicemen or their families on lists for
receiving services and goods.
   ``Refusals to register officers and (non-commissioned officers)
and members of their families arriving to the place of service have
lately become more frequent,'' Gorbachev said, according to the
official news agency Tass.
   ``It leads to illegal limitations in job placement, medical and
other social service,'' he said. He gave officials until Jan. 15 to
resolve the problems.
   The orders revealed a widespread resistance to Red Army presence
in the country, nearly all of whose republics have declared some
form of sovereignty. However, it was unclear whether the orders
would be enforced short of harsher military action.
   Gorbachev has used his presidential powers to issue several
decrees on the economy, but his hands have been tied in a power
struggle for economic control with the republics, led mostly by
Russia.

   The second-ranking Democrat in the House said
Tuesday night he would oppose a resolution authorizing the early
use of force to throw Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the majority leader of the House,
spoke in a telephone interview after some Senate Democrats
questioned the need for offensive action right away.
   The disclosure of Gephardt's position was the first public
opposition among party leaders in Congress to the use of force,
something the United Nations is expected to endorse soon.
   Gephardt, who will outline his views further in a speech on
Wednesday, said in a telephone interview, ``I think we should stay
the course with sanctions.''
   ``I would not be in favor of authorizing force at this point.
I'm not ruling it out,'' Gephardt said.
   ``The question is not whether military action is justified. It
is,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which began several days of hearings on the gulf
crisis.``The question is whether military action is wise at this
time and in our own national interest.''
   Nunn said he supported the resolution to come before the U.N.
Security Council later this week authorizing member countries to
use ``all necessary means'' to restore Kuwait.
   The hearings were called - after Congress adjourned for the year
- in reaction to Bush's decision to send an additional 200,000
troops to the gulf to provide an ``offensive military option.''
   With the administration seeking U.N. approval for the use of
force in the gulf, some committee members said the president also
must make the same request of Congress.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, in remarks to newly elected House
Democrats, underscored the point. ``I would personally want to have
some assurance from the administration that no action would be
taken prior to this Congress meeting, or it would be necessary to
think seriously about calling in the previous Congress,'' he said.
   Neither Foley nor his Senate counterpart, Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, has indicated whether he would support a
congressional resolution authorizing offensive military action.
   The opening day of the session also was marked by the
conspicuous absence of the administration's top military officials
- Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two will testify Monday morning.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said the policy change to underline a
U.S. attack capability undermines the nation's attempts to maintain
international support for the sanctions ``by declaring, through its
own word and those of the imminent U.N. resolution, that our
patience was almost spent.''
   Kerrey is not a member of the panel but he submitted a statement
to the committee.
   Committee member Edard Kennedy, D-Mass., declared, ``If ever
there is a case for giving peace a chance, this is it.''
   Yet another panel Democrat, Alan Dixon of Illinois, suggested
that the administration's ``priorities are slightly misplaced.''
   ``To the best of my knowledge it is the United States Congress
that declares war for the United States - not the United Nations,''
Dixon said.
   Fighting the tide of criticism, Republican John McCain of
Arizona declared, ``The issue is not prerogatives, it is
patriotism.''
   On the question of strategy, Nunn asked, ``Has the president
limited our options by creating a `use it or lose it' situation
with the deployment of such a large U.S. force to the Persian
Gulf?''
   John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the administration has yet to make its
case for military attack in the gulf, arguing that the nation
``cannot get into a war that is not fully understood and backed by
the American people. We need more than sound-bite justification.''
   In the place of senior administration officials, the panel heard
from former CIA Director James Schlesinger, who testified that the
United States believes it will take about a year for international
sanctions against Iraq to take full effect.
   Schlesinger told the panel that that was ``an official
estimate.'' The one time CIA director and defense secretary did not
indicate the basis for his statement.
   ``A year, to me, seems to be in the right ballpark,''
Schlesinger said, time enough ``to drain off the cash that is now
sustaining the smuggling operations that bring in food.''
   ``His society is bleeding and it's going to get worse with the
passage of time,'' Schlesinger said. But it may take somewhat
longer for those difficulties to lead Saddam to change his mind and
withdraw from Kuwait, he said.
   Meanwhile, at a separate hearing, a Treasury Department official
said, ``Iraq's central bank ... and its two primary international
banks ... have been effectively cut off from the international
financial community, so that Iraqi financial flows have been
reduced to a mere trickle of their pre-August levels.''
   R. Richard Newcomb, director of the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, told the House Banking Committee, ``The ever-tightening
economic embargo against Iraq is certain to hamper Iraq's ability
to carry out effective military campaigns and will bring home to
the Iraqi people the futility of Saddam's aggression against
Kuwait.''
   Newcomb, in response to questions from panel members, conceded
that some goods may be reaching Iraq overland, but he refused to
identify countries suspected of breaking the embargo.
   The hearings come as the United Nations Security Council
prepares to vote on a resolution threatening to use ``all necessary
means'' to drive Iraq from Kuwait if it does not leave by January.
   Nunn indicated his support for the resolution but said it ``is
not a substitute for fully informing the American people of our own
nation's objectives and strategy.''
   Kennedy added, ``It is not enough for President Bush to go to
the United Nations to get approval for the use of military force in
the Persian Gulf. He must also come to Congress.''

<HEAD>New York Mayor Signs Bill Banning Cigarette Vending Machines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban on cigarette vending machines in most
public places got final approval Tuesday from Mayor David Dinkins,
a former smoker who said the ban will help keep smokes out of
children's hands.
   ``Today we have achieved an important pro-child, pro-health law
that will save lives,'' Dinkins said. ``Obviously, some children
will still be able to buy cigarettes, but many won't.''
   The mayor pushed for the ban, saying previously that 32,000
children in New York begin smoking each year and 10,000 will die
from complications from the habit.
   The ban, which takes effect Jan. 31, 1992, allows cigarette
vending machines only in taverns, which must keep them at least 25
feet entrances and in view of the operator.
   Dinkins, who gave up smoking 28 years ago, said he plans to work
with state lawmakers to restrict over-the-counter cigarette sales
to children and would also like to phase out cigarette advertising
in baseball stadiums and on city-owned property.
   The city already bans smoking in municipal buildings and
regulates smoking in work places.

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad met Tuesday with
three British Parliament members in talks expected to accelerate
moves to restore diplomatic ties severed four years ago.
   The Syrian government newspaper Tishrin said earlier this month
that Britain should resume relations with Syria if it wanted the 13
Western hostages in Lebanon freed.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency reported the Tuesday
meeting and said Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa also attended.
   Sharaa met Monday with the British delegation of Robert Adley
and Tim Rathbone of the ruling Conservative Party, and Sir David
Steel of the Liberal Democratic Party.
   During the weekend, Sharaa also met with David Gore-Booth, an
undersecretary at the Foreign Office, in the first contact between
the two governments since relations with Damascus were cut over
alleged Syrian involvement in terrorism.
   Sources noted that Assad would not have received the delegation
unless efforts to restore ties gained ground.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that
resumption of relations was unlikely until after the new British
government forms. In London, Conservatives late Tuesday elected
treasury chief John Major to succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime
minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who opposed restoring ties with Syria, ordered
relations severed in November 1986. She said her government had
evidence Syria was behind a plot to blow up an Israeli jetliner at
Heathrow Airport near London in April 1986.
   Resumption of ties with Britain could give new hope for the
release of Western hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists. The
captives include six Americans, four Britons, two Germans and an
Italian.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was taken hostage March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held captive.
   Syria is the main powerbroker in Lebanon, with 40,000 troops
based there under an Arab League mandate. It helped free American
hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in April and Irishman Brian
Keenan in August.
   U.S.-Syrian ties improved in summer when Damascus sided with the
alliance against Saddam Hussein following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. Syria committed nearly 20,000 troops to a military buildup
in the Persian Gulf.
   Syria remains on theU.S. State Department's list of countries
that sponsor terrorism. But Secretary of State James A. Baker III
visited Damascus in September, and President Bush met with Assad in
Geneva last week.

   Switzerland's last bastion of male
supremacy was swept away Tuesday by a Supreme Court judgment that a
tiny Catholic state must allow women to play an active role in
politics.
   The Federal Tribunal ruled that Appenzell-Rhodes interior state
violated Swiss sexual equality laws by refusing to let women
participate in its annual legislative assembly.
   It said that beginning now, women must be allowed to vote at the
assembly and all local elections - and hence be eligible for
political office in the enclave in northeastern Switzerland.
   Switzerland is a federation of 23 cantons (states), joined under
a federal constitution, with large powers of local control retained
by each canton.
   Swiss women won the vote at federal level two decades ago.
   The unanimous decision by one female and six male judges
followed three separate complaints from Appenzellers of both sexes
challenging the exclusion of women.
   ``It's a huge weight off my mind,'' said one of the
complainants, Theres Rohner Sonderegger, after the verdict.
   The outdoor legislative assembly, known as Landsgemeinde, dates
to the Middle Ages. Traditionally attended by men carrying swords
to indicate their voting eligibility, the colorful ceremony has the
last say in local affairs.
   Foreign tourists flocked to the mountainous state with a
population of just 13,000 last April to witness an overwhelming
``no'' to a proposal for female suffrage.

   The city's beleaguered school superintendent
resigned Tuesday after district trustees approved a six-figure
settlement of her contract, ending contention over her allegedly
authoritarian style.
   Trustees voted 5-4 to pay Houston School Superintendent Joan
Raymond $425,000 to buy out her three year contract.
   Ms. Raymond, who has been superintendent of the nation's
fifth-largest school district for four years, will leave the post
June 10 and remain as a consultant through Aug. 31.
   Trustees had been unhappy with what they considered Ms.
Raymond's authoritarian management style and had ordered her in
June to decentralize the district's power structure and make other
changes.
   Several trustees said she fought the reforms, but they lacked
the votes to force her resignation, so Ms. Raymond was put on
probation Nov. 16 pending a performance review in March. She had 2{
years remaining on her contract.

   A school bus filled with students
rear-ended another Tuesday, injuring 28 teen-agers, authorities
said. Most of the injuries appeared minor.
   The buses were taking about 70 students from middle and high
schools in Justin to their homes in rural Denton County when the
accident occurred on Highway 114, one mile west of Interstate 35W.
   Roanoke is about 25 miles northwest of Dallas.
   Most of the injured students walked to ambulances that took them
to hospitals, said Eileen Standridge, an assistant superintendent
for Northwest Independent School District, which serves several
small towns in Denton County.
   ``There are no critical injuries as far as we know,'' said Ron
Hibbs, another assistant superintendent for the district. He said
some injuries may be ``fairly serious.''
   Both drivers suffered injuries, he said.
   Les Weaver, a communications operator for the state Department
of Public Safety, described the accident this way:
   A school bus stopped on the highway to let off children. Behind
it were two cars and two more school buses. The last bus hit the
one in front of it, pushing it into the two cars. The people in the
two cars were not injured, nor was anyone injured in the first bus.

   Two months after it became the only American
warship to have New York as its homeport, the missile cruiser USS
Normandy has received orders for deployment to Operation Desert
Shield, Navy officials said Tuesday.
   The Normandy, one of the Navy's newest Aegis-type cruisers, will
sail ``shortly after Christmas'' as part of an eight-ship battle
group headed by the aircraft carrier USS America, the Navy said.
   The Pentagon earlier this mnth announced that the America, the
USS Ranger and the nuclear-powered USS Theodore Roosevelt would be
sent to the Gulf region to reinforce three other U.S. carriers in
the buildup for possible war against Iraq.
   The America and the Theodore Roosevelt, the Navy's newest
carrier on active duty, are based at Norfolk, Va., the Ranger at
San Diego. Their accompanying escort ships are drawn from those and
other bases on the East and West coasts.
   The Navy announced in Norfolk on Tuesday that the America and
Theodore Roosevelt battle groups would depart about the same time
for the Middle East, but gave no specific date.
   The Desert Shield deployment is the first for the Normandy. It
was commissioned a year ago, the 14th of the Navy's planned 28
Aegis-type cruisers.
   The billion-dollar warship is equipped with a computer-linked
radar and weapons ``battle management'' system designed to defend
carrier groups from long-range threats and provide support for U.S.
warships, aircraft and amphibious forces in operations against
hostile targets.
   The 9,600-ton Normandy arrived Oct. 5 at Naval Station New York,
the first of six warships planned to port at the new naval facility
on Staten Island.
   The USS America battle group will also include the USS Nitro, an
ammunition ship stationed at Earle, N.J., an ordnance supply base
in New York's outer harbor. The Nitro carries a full range of
ammunition including bombs and missiles for naval aircraft, fuel
and other supplies to replenish ships at sea.

   An earthquake hit 30 miles west of
Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory on Wednesday, the
Australian Seismological Center said. No serious damage or injuries
were reported.
   Kevin McCue, chief of the center's earthquake seismological
group, said the quake struck on the far western side of the fault
scarp produced during the January 1988 earthquake at Tennant Creek
which caused serious property damage.
   Tennant Creek Police Sgt. Mark Delaney said the quake, which
measured five on the open-ended Richter scale, was the strongest
temblor since then.
   ``This one lasted about 10 seconds and certainly rattled the
shelves, but we've had no reports of anything being damaged or
anyone being hurt,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald and his son returned to tribal court Tuesday for a second
corruption trial, this one focusing on the tribe's purchase of a
ranch.
   MacDonald is charged with bribery, fraud, conspiracy and 10
counts of ethics violations. He could face four years in jail if
convicted.
   His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., is charged with one
count of conspiracy and could face six months in jail.
   They were convicted Oct. 17 on separate charges of bribery,
ethics violations and conspiracy. They were sentenced to jail, but
were released to help with their appeals.
   The current trial stems from the tribe's February 1987 purchase
of the 491,000-acre Big Boquillas Ranch in northern Arizona. The
tribe paid $33.4 million to Tracy Oil and Gas Co., which had bought
the property for $26.25 million earlier that day.
   The prosecution's criminal complaint alleges that MacDonald, a
Scottsdale real estate broker and K. Tom Tracy, president of Tracy
Oil, allegedly agreed to split the $7.2 million profit three ways.
   Tribal District Court Judge Robert Yazzie ruled Tuesday before
jury selection began that he will not permit defense testimony that
the case is political.

   Israel sent warplanes to blast guerrilla
bases Tuesday after five Israeli soldiers died fighting Palestinian
guerrillas in southern Lebanon. Police said at least 13 Palestinian
guerrillas were killed.
   Lebanese authorities said eight guerrillas were killed in the
ground action and five died in the air raid on guerrillas of Abu
Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council near Sidon.
   It was the Jewish state's highest death toll in the region since
1988, when eight soldiers were killed by a car bomb. The clash was
the third in a week between Palestinians and Israelis in southern
Lebanon - a surge of violence that could threaten efforts to end
Lebanon's civil war.
   Three of the Israelis were buried Tuesday in their homeland.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of the sector where they died,
said in a eulogy: ``The terrorists' mission was foiled. The
settlements of the north are safe. The price is unbearable.''
   Shortly after the Israeli air raid, reporters based in southern
Lebanon said they saw four Israeli gunboats cruise past the border
town of Naquora, apparently heading toward Sidon. Several
helicopter hovered overhead, the witnesses said, but there was no
immediate report of naval bombardments.
   An estimated 5,000 Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas
are based in refugee camps near Sidon.
   Police said four Israeli fighter-bombers fired 12 rockets into a
hilltop position occupied by Fatah-Revolutionary Council fighters
in Shahabil, near Sidon.
   At least two guerrillas were killed and three wounded in the
three-minute raid by F-15 and F-16 jets, police reported.
   They said three other guerrillas were killed in a base of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in nearby Baysour
village. The group's press office in Beirut confirmed the deaths.
   It was Israel's 19th air raid on Lebanon this year. By police
count, 20 people were killed and 62 were wounded in the previous
strikes.
   The ground action between Israeli troops and a guerrilla band
occurred in the foothills of Mount Hermon, about 28 miles southeast
of Sidon.
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
battle broke out shortly after midnight near Shabaa, a Sunni Moslem
village on the Israeli security zone's eastern flank.
   Police said the battle raged for 2{ hours after an Israeli
observation post spotted the guerrllas and called in helicopters
with reinforcements.
   ``By daybreak, the bodies of eight guerrillas were littering the
battleground,'' a police spokesman said. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the Israelis were killed when they tried to examine the
bodies of four of the dead guerrillas.
   ``A big explosion happened. The bodies must have been
booby-trapped,'' he said.
   An Israeli military communique from Jerusalem, however, said the
soldiers ``stormed a ring of four guerrillas who were on their way
toward Israeli territory.'' It said: ``In an exchange of fire at
close range accompanied by the throwing of hand grenades, five
soldiers were killed and another was wounded.''
   There were other reports in Israel saying the soldiers were
killed by a booby trap or when one soldier pulled the pin of a
grenade but was shot before he could throw it.
   In Beirut, George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed it staged the Shabaa attack to mark the start of
the fourth year of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The anniversary is more
than a week away.
   The statement said the attack was staged with guerrillas of the
Libyan Revolutionary Committees.
   A week ago, another Palestinian group claimed responsibility for
an attack in concert with the Libyan Committees. An Israeli officer
died in that battle, which occurred just outside the security zone.
   Sources close to the PLO said Libya has recruited about 300
Lebanese and Palestinians in a Libyan-financed guerrilla faction
called the Libyan Revolutionary Committees. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   On Sunday, a woman detonated a handbag packed with explosives as
she walked past an Israeli patrol in the security zone. She died,
and Israel said two soldiers were wounded. Responsibility for the
attack was claimed by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.
   The Israeli navy on Saturday sank a rubber dinghy off south
Lebanon, killing five guerrillas of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   The security zone, patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and
3,000 Israeli-affiliated militiamen, has been controlled by Israel
since its 1982 invasion of Lebanon.

<HEAD>New York's Highest Court Rules Senate Leader Must Stand Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate minority leader must stand
trial on charges of using public funds to pay four people who
performed no work, New York's highest court ruled Tuesday.
   The state Court of Appeals said in a 6-1 decision that Manfred
Ohrenstein did not have to stand trial on other charges of
illegally using public funds to pay political campaign workers.
   Those charges had been dismissed by a lower court and made up
the bulk of a 564-count indictment against Ohrenstein, a Manhattan
Democrat, and three associates.
   The Court of Appeals, the state's highest, said that while it
did not condone using taxpayer dollars to finance campaign work,
the practice was not illegal.
   The court ordered Ohrenstein to stand trial on so-called no-show
charges of hiring and paying four people who did no work.
   The dismissed charges were considered the central issue in the
case against Ohrenstein because they went to the heart of the
Legislature's operations, where government work and re-election
politics are carefully blended.
   The indictment stems from Ohrenstein's failed attempt to wrest
control of the state Senate from Republicans in 1986. Some of the
employees cited in the dismissed charges were full-time legislative
staffers assigned to work on campaigns. Other workers were hired
for the campaign season, paid with taxpayer dollars and fired after
Election Day.
   Ohrenstein, 65, was indicted in 1987 with Democratic Sen. Howard
Babbush, top Ohrenstein aide Frank Sanzillo and former Democratic
senatorial candidate Joseph Montalto. The Court of Appeals ruling
left them facing trial for their roles in the alleged no-show
hirings.
   Ohrenstein's lawyer, Jack Hoffinger, predicted that it would be
difficult for prosecutors to prove the four employees did no work
or that Ohrenstein knew if they did no work.
   ``The so-called no-shows were put in to dress up the
indictment,'' Hoffinger said. ``This is not a victory for the
prosecution. If you think it is, ask the prosecution.''
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who had asked the
Court of Appeals to reinstate all the charges, said in a statement
that he would pursue the no-show charges ``as promptly as
possible.''
   It was not immediately clear when a trial would begin.
   Ohrenstein faces a maximum of seven years in prison for each of
about 50 charges remaining, Morgenthau spokesman Gerald McKelvey
said.
   Ohrenstein, a senator since 1961, and Babbush would also lose
their Senate seats if convicted of the felonies.
   Two weeks after Ohrenstein revealed that he was under
investigation, the state Legislature passed a resolution
authorizing legislative staffers to engage in political activity as
long as they had some official legislative duties and performed
them.
   Democratic and Republican leaders in the state Legislature had
united behind Ohrenstein and had asked the court to drop the
charges. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, called
Tuesday's decision ``well reasoned.''
   Ohrenstein again failed to take control of the state Senate this
year and lost a seat to the Republicans.

   A huge jet fuel fire that burned unchecked for two
days near Stapleton International Airport was extinguished Tuesday
with help from a team of specialists flown in from Texas.
   Mounting an all-out assault, firefighters put out the blazes in
two storage tanks about 2:30 p.m., 53 hours after the fire began,
said Fire Department spokesman Mike McNeil.
   ``Everybody is relieved. It's been a long ordeal,'' McNeil said.
``There were a lot of smiles on a lot of faces.''
   A five-man team from Williams, Boots &amp; Coots of Port Neches,
Texas, donned fireproof suits and sealed broken valves on an
800,000-gallon tank that was one-third to one-half full of jet fuel
and a 350,000-gallon tank that had only a fraction of fuel left.
   The two tanks had been on fire since Monday. They were ignited
by a pair of 400,000-gallon tanks that burned themselves out
Monday. The four tanks, containing more than 2 million gallons of
jet fuel, were part of a fuel storage farm for Stapleton airport
that includes 12 tanks holding a total of about 5 million gallons
of fuel.
   The storage area is about one-half mile north of the Stapleton
terminal.
   Several water and foam sprays were trained on the two
still-burning tanks to cool them down so the team could move close
enough to spray the leaking valves with potassium bicarbonate.
   McNeil said the blasts of foam and water worked better than
expected - they extinguished the flames.
   Denver fire officials had planned to let the fire burn itself
out, but they changed their strategy Tuesday after a meeting with
Williams, Boots &amp; Coots executives.
   Continental Airlines, which owns four tanks at the fuel storage
area, had flown in the company officials Monday night.
   ``We have $3.8 million worth of product on-site,'' said
Continental spokesman Jim Monaghan.
   The fire diminished markedly in intensity after the
400,000-gallon tanks finally burned themselves out Monday, leaving
smoldering, crumpled metal shells.
   All four storage tanks destroyed in the fire belong to United
Airlines. The airline experienced a severe fuel shortage Sunday
that caused it to delay and reschedule flights, but resolved the
problem Monday by employing tanker trucks and flying in fuel from
outside Denver.
   A snowstorm that dusted Denver with up to 2 inches of snow
dropped temperatures below freezing and further hampered the
efforts of more than 60 firefighters Tuesday morning.
   The snowstorm temporarily knocked out firefighters' pumps and
froze water on their clothing and equipment. Warming tents were set
up for the firefighters, who took turns on the fire line.
   The snow later ended and the sun came out, but temperatures did
not rise much above freezing.
   A broken valve on one of the 400,000-gallon tanks was thought to
be what triggered the fire.

   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said Wednesday China
will not vote for a United Nations resolution authorizing use of
force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   He refused to say whether China will veto it or abstain.
   As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China has veto power over any resolution. It has voted for
all 10 previous resolutions that seek to pressure Iraq to end its
nearly 4-month-old occupation of Kuwait, but has expressed great
reluctance to see force used.
   ``It has always been the position of China to call for a
peaceful settlement,'' Qian told reporters at the Beijing airport
while preparing to leave for the United States to cast China's
vote.
   Qian said reports in the United States that China will support
the force resolution have ``no basis.''
   Asked if he meant China will not vote for the resolution, Qian
said, ``I think so.''
   Asked specifically it he planned to veto, he replied, ``I have
not said so,'' then added, ``I think you will know after I cast the
vote. I will not say anything beforethen.''
   He may plan to press Washington for concessions before agreeing
to abstain. Qian said he will meet with U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on Wednesday night before Thursday's U.N.
Security Council session.
   Among concessions he may seek, China wants the United States to
allow the World Bank to resume normal lending to China, and to lift
remaining sanctions imposed after China's June 1989 army attack on
pro-democracy protesters.
   Qian's visit will be the first official visit by a Chinese
minister since then.

   Iraq will have less than seven weeks to withdraw nearly a
half-million troops from Kuwait before it faces the prospect of a
U.N.-authorized military strike, the Soviet ambassador to the
United Nations said Tuesday.
   Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov said the U.N. demand for withdrawal
would specify Jan. 15 as the date for the Iraqi forces that overran
Kuwait 3{ months ago to leave the emirate. Vorontsov said there was
a consensus among the five permanent members of the Security
Council on the resolution.
   But Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said Wednesday at Beijing's
airport that China will not vote for a U.N. resolution authorizing
use of force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait. He refused to say
whether China will veto it or abstain.
   Meanwhile, three Americans waving Iraqi and American flags
arrived in Jordan after being freed by Iraq's leader, Saddam
Hussein.
   And in Saudi Arabia, where the multitude of U.S. troops are
based facing off against Iraq, the first rain of the two-month
rainy season fell in the north, filling jeep tracks with puddles
and forcing Arab forces allied with the West to bundle up against
the unfamiliar dampness.
   U.S. boxing great Muhammad Ali met for 50 minutes Tuesday with
Saddam in Baghdad and was promised that a number of Americans held
hostage in Iraq would be freed at an unspecified date. Ali said he
wouldn't leave Iraq until he is handed over some hostages held as
``human shields'' against possible attack.
   As one of the permanent U.N. Security Council members, China has
veto power over any resolution. It has voted for all 10 previous
resolutions that seek to pressure Iraq to end its occupation of
Kuwait, but has expressed great reluctance to see force used.
   ``It has always been the position of China to call for a
peaceful settlement,'' Qian told reporters at the airport while
preparing to leave for the United States to cast China's vote.
   The measure, to authorize ``all necessary means'' to get Iraq
out of Kuwait after that date, is to be voted on Thursday.
   The deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal had been the only sticking
point in a draft U.N. Security Council resolution.
   In a fresh sign that the Baghdad government is bracing for war,
the Pentagon said Iraq is rapidly increasing its troop strength in
Kuwait and southern Iraq. It said Iraq has 450,000 troops in the
region, an increase of 20,000 over last week.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile,
questioned whether it is really in the ``vital interest'' of the
United States to use military force to liberate Kuwait, which Iraq
seized on Aug. 2.
   Some of the freed Americans, whose families had traveled to Iraq
to plead with Saddam for their release, told reporters at the Amman
airport that the Bush administration had ignored their plight.
   ``I was not released with help from my government,'' said John
Stevenson of Panama City, Fla. ``It was my family who did it.''
   The United States has demanded the unconditional release of all
of the hundreds of foreigners held hostage in Iraq, and the State
Department has discouraged private hostage-freeing missions.
   Another freed American, Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill.,
suggested the United States should negotiate with Saddam. ``I
believe it is time we started talking,'' he said.
   The third freed American was Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash.
Ten Britons and five Germans were released as well. The women in
the British group carried flowers; the Americans waved the U.S. and
Iraqi flags.
   At the United Nations, the stage was set for a Security Council
meeting to consider the strongest measure yet against Iraq. The
resolution calls on Iraq to release all foreign hostages, withdraw
its troops and restore Kuwait's government or face imminent action
by U.N.-authorized multinational forces.
   Western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze had settled on Jan. 15 as the deadline for an
Iraqi withdrawal.
   Britain and the United States had favored Jan. 1, but had said
the question was open to negotiations.
   The United States had already secured the backing of the other
permanent members of the Security Council for the measure. The
permanent members - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France as well as China - have the power to veto council
resolutions.
   Altogether, nine votes on the 15-member council are need to
approve the resolution. It is supported by at least six of the
non-permanent council members: Canada, Finland, Romania, Ivory
Coast, Zaire and Ethiopia.
   Yemen, the council's only Arab member, is believed likely to
abstain or vote against it.
   Malaysia and Colombia's votes are uncertain. Colombian foreign
minister Luis Jaramillo said Tuesday that Colombia still has not
decided how to vote, but would prefer a diplomatic solution.
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon has said his country could not
support the resolution. The Soviet Union sent a high-ranking envoy
to Cuba, a longtime client state, for talks on Tuesday in advance
of the vote.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also held talks Tuesday in
Moscow with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal,
and said both sides agreed the U.N. measure would promote a ``just
resolution'' of the gulf crisis.
   In Washington, the Senate Armed Services Committee opened four
days of hearings on President Bush's gulf policy.
   The hearings were prompted by Bush's decision earlier this month
to send more troops and build an ``offensive military option'' with
a force that will total about 430,000 in the region by January. The
panel's chairman, Sam Nunn, said the buildup raises serious
questions.
   ``Is it in our vital interest to liberate Kuwait? How long can
we sustain more than 400,000 troops? Has President Bush limited his
options by creating a use-it-or-lose-it situation?'' the Georgia
Democrat asked.
   ``It is not enough for President Bush to go to the United
Nations to get approval for the use of military force in the
Persian Gulf,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the
committee. ``He must also come to Congress.''
   Pentagon pokesman Pete Williams, outlining new U.S. estimates
of Iraqi troop strength, said half of Iraq's estimated 450,000
troops in the theater of operations - southern Iraq and Kuwait -
are inside Kuwait itself. The troops are mainly defensive in
nature, but ``have the ability to go on the offensive'' if
necessary, he said.

   Historical novel ``Middle Passage,'' which
chronicles the journey of a freed African slave returning to his
homeland, won the 1990 National Book Award competition for fiction
Tuesday night.
   Charles Johnson wrote the book, which takes place in 1830 and
tells the story of a terrifying voyage to Africa on a clipper ship.
   Ron Charnow's ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty
and the Rise of Modern Finance'' won in the non-fiction category
during the 40th anniversary awards dinner at the Plaza Hotel.
   The competition was marked by the presence of little-known
writers from small publishing houses and ``acute dividedness''
among the jurors who chose them.
   The five fiction works that were up for consideration included
three books by immigrant authors - the first novels of Jessica
Hagedorn and Ilena Castedo, and the 42-year-old second book of
Felipe Alfau, who is 88.
   Johnson, an English professor at the University of Washington
who wrote two other novels and a collection of short fiction, was
among two established writers in the fiction category. The other
was Joyce Carol Oates.
   Johnson's novel, published by Atheneum, uses the freed slave's
difficult trip as a catalyst for self-discovery and also marks a
passage for African-American fiction. The title refers to the
crossing of the Atlantic to America from Africa by slave ships.
   ``In this decade, we will see the emergence of black-author
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from
narrow complaint to broad celebration,'' said Johnson, 42.
   One of the fiction jurors, writer Paul West, said there was
``acute dividedness over nearly everything'' discussed by the
five-member panel that chose the nominees. He charged that ``ethnic
considerations, ideology and moral self-righteousness'' had
prevailed over style and merit.
   But Sonny Mehta, president of Alfred A. Knopf publishers, said
although the list of nominees was obscure, he saw nothing
``sinister'' in the choices.
   ``It looks as if they were looking around for books that have
not had their share of praise,'' Mehta said.
   In the non-fiction category, the four other finalists were books
about teaching, former President Nixon, artist Jackson Pollock and
Roosevelt Cabinet member Harold Ickes.
   Chernow's winner was published by Atlantic Monthly
Press-Entrekin Books. The book traces the ups and downs of the most
influential family in the history of American banking. It charts
the Morgan family's story and the changing relationships between
financiers and companies since 1838.
   ``My motivation for writing the book started with my concern
with what was happening in the 1980s,'' said Chernow, 41, of
Brooklyn Heights.
   He said 19th century bankers had ``a very different notion of
what business was, it was a gentlemen's club against today's wild
carnival of greed.''
   The National Books Foundation also honored Saul Bellow, Nobel
laureate and the only three-time winner of the National Book Award.
   The 10 finalists came from among 375 books put forward by 72
publishers. For the first time in years, none came from such
prestigious houses as Knopf; Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; or Simon &amp;
Schuster.
   Alfau's book, ``Chromos,'' was retrieved from oblivion by Dalkey
Archive Press, an Illinois publisher whose list amounts to about 15
titles a year and whose biggest seller has been a novel that sold
6,000 copies.
   The Spanish-born Alfau had his first novel, ``Locos: A Comedy of
Gestures,'' published in 1936. It was rediscovered and reissued
last year by Dalkey. When the publisher asked whether Alfau had
written anything else, he came up with ``Chromos,'' which he
finished in 1948.
   Castedo's ``Paradise'' was published by Grove Weidenfeld and
Hagedorn's ``Dogeaters'' by Pantheon, which has been warring with
its parent company, Random House, over Pantheon's tradition of
against-the-grain publishing.
   Atheneum brought out Johnson's ``Middle Passage'' and the Oates
book, ``Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart,'' came
from E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams.
   The other non-fiction finalists were:
   ``Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and
Their High School,'' by Samuel G. Freedman.
   ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician,''
by Roger Morris.
   ``Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and
Gregory White Smith.
   ``Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes,
1874-1952,'' by T.H. Watkins.

   The United States has won the backing of
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France for a U.N. resolution
threatening to use ``all necessary means'' to drive Iraq from
Kuwait if it does not leave by January.
   With the agreement Monday among the five permanent Security
Council members, the broad coalition the United States has mustered
against Saddam Hussein crossed a crucial threshold, authorizing the
use of military force.
   There had been speculation the Soviets and Chinese might abstain
on the resolution, which the 15-member council is expected to take
up on Thursday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has traveled the globe for
weeks seeking support from Security Council members for the
use-of-force resolution.

   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) - President Bush, buoyed by a cheering
throng and a fireworks welcome, says Mexico and the United States
are embarking on ``an era more cooperative and more prosperous''
than ever before.
   ``I've come to Mexico tonight with a message of respect, of
admiration and hope for a brighter future shared by our two
countries,'' Bush told tens of thousands packed into Heroes' Plaza
outside the Governor's Palace Monday evening.
   ``Viva Mexico,'' Bush shouted before he and his wife viewed an
elaborate fireworks demonstration from a glassed-in stage on the
plaza.
   Bush was in Mexico on a two-day trip focused primarily on the
two countries' efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Industry analysts say MCA Inc. - the
entertainment giant that gave the world ``E.T.'' and ``Jaws'' - is
so well run that its new Japanese owners will allow creative
control to remain in American hands.
   In the biggest Japanese purchase ever of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. struck a $6.6 billion deal for
MCA on Monday.
   The Japanese maker of videocasette recorders, televisions and
stereos under such brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar
got a company that produces hit TV shows such as ``Murder, She
Wrote'' and ``Major Dad,'' records artists such as Elton John and
Guns N' Roses and owns many of the biggest movies of all time.
   MCA became the fourth major Hollywood studio to come under
foreign control, raising fears that responsiblity for the financing
and political content of American entertainment is falling
increasingly into non-American hands.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Former regulator Edwin Gray says financier
Charles H. Keating Jr. waged a campaign to discredit him after he
moved to curb risky financial practices at Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.
   The former Federal Home Loan Bank Board chief told the Senate
Ethics Committee Monday that Keating's campaign followed ``years of
private threats and public vilification'' aimed at easing federal
thrift regulation.
   Gray was resuming testimony today before committee, which is
investigating charges that five senators improperly pressured
regulators to ease scrutiny of Lincoln Savings.
   The Irvine, Calif., institution's $2 billion collapse has been
the most spectacular in the thrift industry.

   LONDON (AP) - Two contenders apparently were neck-and-neck and
the third was hoping to force a runoff in today's voting by
Conservative Party legislators for Britain's next prime minister.
   Treasury chief John Major, 47, the chosen favorite of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine each claimed they were nearing the 187 votes needed for
outright victory as party leader.
   But there were signs that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had
enough support to deny either a majority of the 372 legislators in
the House of Commons, forcing a final ballot on Thursday.
   In a third ballot, lawmakers vote for first and second choices.
If no one wins a majority of the first-choice votes, the
third-placed contender is eliminated and his second-choice votes
are distributed to determine a winner.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - Former President Augusto Pinochet still
is the army commander, but has been losing political ground to
Patricio Aylwin, the elected civilian who succeeded him.
   Even right-wing politicians who supported the 74-year-old
general during his 16{ years of military rule, which ended in
March, are saying he should stay out of politics.
   The annual revision of the armed forces high command this month
gave Aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his
political authority.
   For the first time since the political coup that brought him to
power in 1973, the makeup of the high command was not determined by
Pinochet alone.

   COLDWATER, Mich. (AP) - The chatter resembles that of any beauty
salon. Women tease each other about their ages and their graying
hair as they sit under hair dryers and flip through timeworn
magazines.
   Posters of the latest hairstyles cover the battered walls, and
the pungent odor of the solution used for permanents fills the air.
   The tools of the beauty trade at the medium-security
Florence-Crane Women's Facility are nothing special, but they're of
some concern. Scissors, electric razors and chemicals can be
dangerous - especially in the hands of convicted criminals.
   Some of these women are locked up for life. Some can receive no
visitors.
   Inmates say the prison beauty shop serves an essential purpose.
In the words of beautician Diane Carter, ``Everyone feels better,
even if they've had a bad day.'' She's serving 20 years on drug and
escape charges.

   The more things change, the more this tiny
town wants to remain the same.
   That means the kind of place where people live in old school
buses or build homes as the spirt moves them. A place where the
town building inspector can take a six-month leave of absence to
help a peace group build a school in El Salvador. Where volunteers
give away bread on Fridays. Where most of the roads are dirt. Where
most of the residents like them that way.
   ``This is a town of rugged individualists who came here because
we wanted to be free to be ourselves,'' said Prudence Smith, a
member of the five-person town planning board.
   And so they are, a happy melange of young and old, of machinists
and musicians, college professors and farmers, sewage workers and
aging hippies.
   Isolated and poor, with no services to speak of and no intention
of adding any, Wendell has always attracted its share of
truthseekers.
   Mormon Hollow, marked by a tiny cemetery on the north side of
town, is named for travelers who left a 19th-century religious
caravan and settled here. In the 1960s and 1970s, Wendell became a
haven for back-to-the-landers and flower children from the
University of Massachusetts and the other colleges clustered around
Amherst, 30 miles away.
   ``Not only are some of my best friends hippies, but some of our
best selectmen have been hippies,'' said Selectman Ted Lewis, not a
hippie himself.
   But Wendell appeared to be falling victim to its own popularity,
with the population more than doubling to 830 in 20 years. The
problem facing children of the '60s in the 1990s was how they could
all stay in Wendell and still retain the town spirit that attracted
them there in the first place.
   ``For a long time, our poverty and isolation protected us, but
no longer,'' Smith said. ``The cost of living, even here, has
increased to the point where it is becoming difficult for a lot of
people.''
   So townsfolk held a seven-hour ``visioning workshop'' in which
they wrote down, illustrated and debated things the town could use,
such as a tool collective to share such homeowner necessities as
mowers, chainsaws, grass clippers and ladders. They drew up lists
of ``Places of the Heart,'' or landmarks, they wanted to protect,
ranging from the Town Common to a heron rookery.
   Some changes came quickly. A volunteer committee, called the
``Star Riders,'' was formed to offer others rides into town, the
result of a discussion about the lack of public transit.
   With a $20,000 state grant, residents hired a small, local
consulting firm to help draw up a master plan, the centerpiece of
which is the proposed ``Wendell Works'' - a town-sponsored
commercial organic farm and spinoff cottage industries. In a
typically casual way, there is no estimated time of completion.
   ``People don't have much opportunity to spend money in
Wendell,'' said Smith, noting that the town's commercial
development is limited to two general stores, an egg farm and an
auto salvage yard.
   The fruit and vegetables produced by the farm could be sold by
subscription to residents, who would pay in advance for a share of
the crop when it ripened, she said.
   Wendellites want to expand the operation beyond produce into
baked goods, milk deliveries, firewood sales and other farm-related
businesses.
   ``It wouldn't add a lot of property to the tax rolls,'' Smith
said. ``But if we had a soy dairy that would just satisfy the
town's own needs, it would be a way to recycle Wendell money in
Wendell and make it easier for individuals to come up with the cash
flow they need to make it here.''
   And it would fit Wendell's tradition of doing its own thing.
   This, after all, is a town that boasts its own troupe of African
dancers and drummers, and a centrally located Free Box where
residents are encouraged to take what they need and leave what they
can spare.
   Once a month, Town Hall becomes the Full Moon Coffeehouse for
performances benefiting causes from tax resistance to a group that
opposed state surveillance flights to ferret out marijuana growers.
   All this doesn't necessarily make an impression on folks who
grew up in Wendell.
   ``There's nothing new with the younger people,'' said Raymond
Avery, a 72-year-old native. ``Actually, they have less sense of
individuality than the older folks.''

<HEAD>Brad Dourif's Horror-Filled Career</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990s may be a true horror story for
actor Brad Dourif, who currently appears in no less than four
spooky films.
   The coincidence of so many chilling movies shines light on the
darker side of his career. And here's a guy who cringes at fright
films.
   ``I get real scared,'' he confesses. ``I never watched horror
pictures when I was growing up. I have a daughter, Christina, who
loves horror films. She brings them home and watches them in our
living room. I'm sitting there with pillows over my head, and she's
sitting there stonefaced. She just absorbs them somehow without
flinching.''
   November was kind of a Brad Dourif Film Festival month with the
release of ``The Exorcist III,'' ``Stephen King's Graveyard
Shift,'' ``Child's Play 2'' and ``Grim Prairie Tales.''
   In addition, Dourif was seen playing ``a weasel'' in ``Sonny
Boy,'' a drama that came and went in a wink. Not so ``The
Exorcist'' and ``Child's Play'' sequels, which landed No. 1 on the
box-office list. ``Grim Prairie Tales'' was a bomb.
   The actor commented on the films during a recent interview.
   -``Graveyard Shift'': ``It was fun. I went down and shot little
scenes for two weeks and then returned in summer and shot one day
of a big scene. I was working in two other movies at the same time.
I was doing `Chaindance' most of the time. When I got a break, I
went to Toronto for a film called `Murder Blues.'
   ``I met Stephen King once. I was trying to pick out some
breakfast cereal and all of a sudden this hand came in and a voice
said, `Hi. Steve King. Like your acting.' I shook the hand, looked
up and he was gone.''
   -``The Exorcist III'': ``I was an extremely nasty guy (he plays
the devil). People don't come much nastier than that guy. The fun
thing about that character was that he really enjoyed his work. It
was the most intelligently written part of the horror genre that I
have read. (William Peter) Blatty is a wonderful writer.''
   -``Child's Play 2'' (as the voice of Chuckie, the evil doll):
``That is what I call my generic Bad Guy from the North voice. I do
it off the top of my head without any effort at all. When I think,
`What does a bad guy from the North sound like?' Chuckie comes
out.''
   -``Grim Prairie Tales'': ``It's sort of a horror film, but I
don't play a crazy person.'' He and James Earl Jones sit around a
frontier campfire and spin yarns of terror.
   Why do producers of horror pictures think of Brad Dourif?
   ``Well, I started my career in `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'
as a kind of crazy guy,'' the actor said. ``Now we're in an era of
horror films. That's a field day for actors who can do crazy
people. Of course, they're going to think of me - `Get Brad. He
does this kind of thing.'''
   Dourif, 40, spent his early years in Huntington, W.Va, and two
movies had a profound impact on him during his youth.
   ``I went through a very difficult time when I was young,'' he
recalled. ``My father died when I was 3, and I went through a
period of adjusting to a stepfather. My way of dealing with it as a
child was to kind of escape into a dream world. I had a horrible
time in school because I was always staring out the window.
   ``I saw two films with my grandmother. One of them was `The Red
Balloon,' the other was `The Bicycle Thief.' These films really had
an impact on me. They dealt with problems I was going through. The
problem of adjusting was in `The Red Balloon.' The world was
against this kid, but he has something about him, the red balloon.
   ``Then there was the father-son relationship in `The Bicycle
Thief.' I learned I wasn't alone. I connected bigtime with them.
That was the moment when I wanted to have something to do with
film.''
   In 1973, director Milos Forman saw Dourif in the play ``When You
Coming Home, Red Ryder?'' in New York and cast him as the tragic
Billy Bibbit in ``Cuckoo's Nest.'' That resulted in an Academy
Award nomination as supporting actor and a host of offers. Forman
cast him as the younger brother in ``Ragtime.'' Other films have
included ``Eyes of Laura Mars,'' ``Wise Blood'' ``Heaven's Gate''
and ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``It would be lovely to say that I made a wise choice by
choosing to play character parts,'' he commented. ``But let's face
it, all the money and all the screen time is in playing leading
men. You get the girl, you get more time on the screen and they pay
you more. Of course I would prefer that.
   ``On the other hand, if you show people you can play all kinds
of parts, your career is going to last longer.''

<HEAD>NBC Reporter Dies - But Survives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years ago, Jay Barbree, a space reporter
who has covered more than 60 manned launches in his 32 years with
NBC, went for a run along the beach near his home in Cocoa Beach,
Fla.
   It almost was his last. He collapsed and suffered what doctors
call ``sudden cardiac death.'' He had no pulse for five minutes.
Only quick action by neighbors and paramedics saved him.
   Frightening, but a blessing in disguise. Had it not happened, he
says, odds are that he wouldn't have learned he needed a coronary
bypass operation. A few years later, he could have had a definitely
fatal heart attack.
   ``Me dropping dead on the beach is what saved my life. That's a
hell of a thing to say, but that's it,'' said Barbree, who has
written a just-published book about his experience, ``The Day I
Died.''
   Now 56, Barbree, the son of a Georgia farmer, had done his best
to avoid such an attack.
   Aware that the men of his family had a history of heart
problems, he had quit smoking 11 years earlier, watched his
cholesterol count, avoided high-salt foods, and exercised regularly
- all that good stuff.
   ``The scary thing about it is that there was no warning,'' he
said. ``I was always convinced when I was jogging that if I overdid
it, I'd have pain in my chest, something that said, `Hey, Jay, slow
down.'
   ``But there's a hormone - I forget its name - that protects you
against pain, and you get what's known as a runner's high. It's
like a drug. ... You get addicted to it.''
   In retrospect, ``I was a big idiot, down there running like mad
on the beach. It put a bigger demand on my coronary arteries to
deliver blood to the (heart) organ than they could sustain.''
   The arteries were partly blocked by plaque, he said. He suffered
the attack - a ventricular fibrillation - due to their condition.
   ``It's like a clogged fuel line,'' he said. ``You can have a
perfect engine, but if it can't get fuel, it's going to quit.''
   After a period of recuperation, reflection and what is known as
a PETscan, an electronic test designed to detect heart disease in
its earliest stages, Barbree agreed to coronary bypass surgery.
   It was done this month last year. He didn't lay about
afterwards, though.
   Although his work was extremely limited and done at home, ``I
was back on the air within 30 days,'' said Barbree, who has covered
the nation's manned space launches since Alan Shepard's first
suborbital shot in 1961.
   Now, he's back at full power, still covering space matters for
NBC News and the NBC radio network. He also occasionally reports
for some NBC-owned stations and the network's affiliates.
   Coming close to final checkout time tends to make a man think
differently about things. Barbree is no exception.
   Now living in a new home 10 minutes from Cape Canaveral, he
doesn't jog anymore. But ``I walk briskly now. ... Old Harry Truman
was right. You get out there and walk.''
   Another change: ``Before I `died,' I was for capital punishment,
the death penalty. Now I'm against it. I sort of figure that death
is God's business. Now, no matter how brutal a crime a man or woman
commits, I simply feel he or she should be locked up forever.''
   Another: ``Even though I have a black belt in aikido'' - a
Japanese system of self-defense - ``I don't think I can hurt
anybody now. But I still have a temper I'm trying to get under
control.''
   And perhaps the most important: ``I really appreciate my family,
my friends, people I'm close to, now. I just feel closer, more
concerned for them, than I ever did before.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   LIGHTS, CAMERA, OPENING STATEMENTS: With the planned merger of
two cable services devoted to the living law, there's going to be a
whole lot more than Judge Wapner on the tube next year. The merged
services, In Court and American Courtroom Network, will start life
next summer as the Courtroom Television Network.
   Meanwhile, CBS is considering a half-hour real-court series,
``On Trial,'' and NBC is pondering a daytime series called
``Trialwatch.'' All this is in addition to NBC's ``L.A. Law,''
``Night Court'' and ``Law and Order,'' ABC's ``Gabriel's Fire,''
and CBS' ``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill.'' But they, of course, are
only make-believe.

<HEAD>Shortages May Bring Long, Dark Winter to Bulgaria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pattern of electricity supply is two
hours on, two off, and Sofia is even running out of matches,
candles and kerosene.
   The periodic darkness and prospects of a cold, hard winter are
symptomatic of Bulgaria's worst economic and political crisis. The
governing Socialists, formerly the Communists, are locked with the
opposition in an increasingly hostile debate over how to run the
country.
   Dimitar Sokolov, deputy chairman of the Committee for Power
Generation, indicated the electricity supply may be erratic even if
Bulgaria's crippled nuclear plant is repaired and brought back into
normal service.
   Oil for heating also is a question mark. Unless Soviet crude oil
deliveries are made as expected, ``the whole district heating
system would be in danger,'' he said.
   Sokolov said heating in Sofia is provided exclusively by
oil-fired plants, and oil storage facilities depots are only
one-third full.
   Moscow has supplied most of Eastern Europe's oil for years, but
the Soviets are missing deliveries because of their own economic
problems.
   Four Soviet 440-megawatt reactors and a 1,000-megawatt reactor
at Bulgaria's only nuclear power station, on the Danube River at
Kozlodui, provide 30 percent of Bulgaria's electricity.
   The 1,000-megawatt reactor went down at the end of October for
the second time in four months because of a mechanical problem.
   Another 1,000-megawatt reactor is scheduled to go on stream in
mid-January, increasing the country's power supply by 10 percent,
but whether it will is uncertain.
   Hospitals, government offices, other public institutions,
industrial enterprises and food shops are exempt from the the power
cuts, Sokolov said, but the government has imposed power
restrictions on industry.
   Stores can operate during the daylight hours, but when the power
is off they close between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., the time most workers
could do their shopping.
   Reporters recently happened into a basement restaurant where
employees were huddled around a kerosene lamp waiting for the
lights to go on. They did, and revealed 15 or 20 other customers
waiting in the dark.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov, one of a group that ousted hard-line
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov a year ago, is urging opposition
legislators to support his plans for market reform.
   His critics say Lukanov has exhausted his credit with the public
during a year of economic deterioration. They demand the
resignation of his government, and are supported by growing numbers
of protesters.
   While they wait for something to be done, daily life becomes
more difficult for Bulgaria's 9 million people.
   ``You have to adapt to the situation as best you can, but people
are growing ever more nervous,'' said Valery Lazov, a Sofia taxi
driver.
   ``People these days seem to think only about all the items that
won't be available in the shops tomorrow. Breakfast for our
third-grade daughter has to be prepared the day before because
there is no light in the morning.''
   Lazov added, however, that he was better off than many others
because he has ``a storage battery to operate the radio, and I have
a lamp from the car.'' He said some people he knew didn't even have
candles. Matches are at a premium.
   Elitsa Velichkova, a 16-year old Sofia high school student, said
her family was ``very angry because there is no television'' and
had ``run out of kerosene for the lamp.''
   Sokolov belittled the technical and personnel problems at the
Kozlodui nuclear plant, where experts from the International Atomic
Energy Agency have been reviewing technical and safety conditions.
   In a recent letter, Kozlodui employees warned of inadequate
safety precautions and lack of expert personnel for the new
1,000-megawatt reactor. Sokolov said of the letter: ``We did have
enough personnel by the time the letter arrived, but they had to
take exams, and most of them have done so in the meantime.''
   Nearly a dozen specialists from the Soviet Union were flown in
to help out for several months, he said.
   An official at the nuclear agency's headquarters in Vienna,
speaking anonymously, indicated the small Soviet-made reactors were
outdated and practically impossible to modernize.
   ``It's like trying to build high tech into an old truck,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tawfic Sofer, a retired cloth merchant and
caretaker of Baghdad's main synagogue, peered through the makeshift
peephole of an iron gate 10 feet high.
   When ordered by two government officials, from State Security
and the Information Ministry, the 65-year-old Iraqi Jew unlocked
the gate and swung it open.
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' he said several times in Arabic, his eyes
on the cars parked outside.
   Satisfied that the officials were alone, except for a foreign
reporter, he guided the group to the synagogue.
   President Saddam Hussein's government sometimes allows visits by
Western news media to the synagogue in downtown Baghdad, but
requires Iraqi officials to accompany them for ``security reasons''
that are not explained.
   Reporters are discouraged from visiting the synagogue on the
Jewish Sabbath, which runs from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
   Reminders of Saddam are omnipresent in Iraq, and the synagogue
is no exception. His portrait is on two calendars that hang on the
wall at the entrance.
   The square, white two-story synagogue was built in 1942 in the
middle of a bazaar.
   Its walls are covered with Scriptures written in Hebrew and
there are many shelves of old books. The synagogue's Torah scrolls,
the handwritten five books of Moses that form the foundation of the
Jewish faith, are on a raised platform, concealed by a black and
gold curtain.
   ``It is a very rich collection,'' said Sofer, a bachelor who
gave up his business to tend the synagogue after the last caretaker
died two years ago. ``We are fine and we do not want war. We are a
very small community, but we are surviving.''
   About 600 Jews live in Baghdad, 200 more in the port city of
Basra, 100 in the northern city of Mosul and 100 or so in other
areas of Iraq, he said.
   Iraq had a flourishing Jewish community of doctors, lawyers,
professors and businessmen with 65 synagogues when Iraq gained
political independence from Britain in 1932.
   Only two synagogues still function. More than 120,000 Iraqi Jews
moved to Israel soon after the Jewish state was born in 1948.
   Sofer said his ancestors and those of most Iraqi Jews came to
Baghdad from Babylon centuries ago. More than 2,500 years ago, King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Jerusalem and carried the
captive Children of Israel back to the land between the Tigris and
the Euphrates rivers.
   Saddam often is compared with Nebuchadnezzar in the Baghdad of
today. Iraqi officials describe the Jews of Babylon as an ancient
Fifth Column who helped Persian invaders take the city.
   According to the oft-told story, which does not appear in the
Bible, the Babylonian Jews advised King Cyrus to destroy dams on
the Euphrates, thus lowering water levels in moats around the city
so his troops could enter.
   ``We do have problems,'' Sofer said of Baghdad's remaining Jews.
He paused, looked at the Iraqi officials and continued:
   ``Our problems are marriages. We don't have enough young men to
marry. We have at least 25 girls ready to marry, but there are not
enough eligible men.''
   Sofer said Iraqi Jews hav  only one shohet, the butcher who
slaughters animals and prepares the meat according to ancient
Jewish law.
   ``It is a big problem, but we are trying to solve it,'' Sofer
said. ``He has to work overtime. There is no other way. When he is
sick, we have a major problem.''
   ``We are very lucky'' that two rabbis serve Baghdad, he said.
   Like all Iraqis interviewed, of whatever faith, Sofer would not
say if people live in fear of Saddam.
   When asked whether he feared persecution if the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia attacked in an effort to force
Iraq out of Kuwait, he said: ``We pray there is no war.''
   ``The people here do not trust us, but we are not bothered. But
if there is war, we may face problems.'' Sofer refused to
elaborate.
   Iraq, a predominantly Moslem country, denies any persecution of
Jews.
   ``We have Jewish people studying in university,'' said an
Information Ministry official, who cannot be named under government
regulations. ``They are also in business.''
   He said Jewish businessmen, like their Moslem counterparts, were
free to travel outside Iraq.
   Saddam's government, however, carries on a regular propaganda
program to ``expose the Zionist movement's imperialist goals.''

<HEAD>Say Something Nice About Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though you might never guess it from the way
they are described, recessions aren't all bad, any more than
Michael Milken is totally greedy or completely charitable.
   Recessions put stocks on sale, making them available to ew
buyers. They allow housing prices to drop into the range of folks
who have waited for years to fulfill their dream. They tend to
bring inflation down.
   In contrast, expansions generally are praised, though they
sometimes lead to inefficient buying and selling practices,
deterioration of quality, poor service, inflation, irresponsible
borrowing habits and the like.
   Experience has demonstrated, in fact, that some of the nation's
worst economic problems were generated by expansions and corrected
by contractions, a dramatic example of which is the nation's
nagging imbalance of trade.
   Year after year during the long expansion of the 1980s Americans
imported far more than they exported. The economy was strong, and
one consequence of that strength was the ability and desire to own
foreign manufactured goods.
   It cost Americans jobs, and it cost them the ownership of part
of their country, since the dollars sent abroad were sent back by
foreigners to buy American companies and commercial real estate.
   Now that problem is being addressed, thanks to the slowdown and
the threat of recession. Americans are watching their dollars. They
are importing less. And faced with a domestic downturn, domestic
businesses have improved exports.
   Despite sharply higher prices for imported oil, overall imports
fell 2.4 percent in September. Meanwhile, exports have been rising.
If you exclude oil, the deficit rate has been nearly halved since
1987, when the economy faltered.
   This corrective ability seldom wins accolades for recessions,
just as bad colds that force overactive people to bed are usually
damned for the postnasal drip rather than praised for the enforced
rest that avoids a worse breakdown.
   Recessions, it is true, inevitably mean layoffs, plant closings,
lowered profits, dividend cuts and lowered tax revenues. They can
cause a great deal of pain to a great many people, especially if
they persist for a year or more.
   They seldom do. Since World War II, there have been eight
economic recessions, but only two lasted more than a year - from
November 1973 through March 1974, and from July 1981 through
November 1982. The recession of 1980 lasted a mere seven months,
and that of 1957-1958 just nine months. Two lasted 11 months and
two persisted for a year.
   But in each instance they also set the stage for healthier
economic expansion, reflected in job creation, new plants, higher
profits, better real wages, stronger securities and revenue
increases.
   They rearranged the competitive marketplace, routing out poor
products and poorly managed companies, encouraging competition,
creativity and improved productivity, and discouraging waste of
human resources, money, time and opportunity.
   To an extent, they routed out frivolous activities and
expenditures and re-established more sensible priorities.
   All recessions hurt, but they also give opportunity - to prudent
folks who saved their money to buy a house, or who seek a good
investment. And they offer relief to the millions of people whose
variable-rate loans had become onerous.
   A recession will always be viewed as an unwelcome guest or even
as the enemy who seeks to do us in. But the real rascal is the
excess produced by the preceding expansion. Recessions seek to
correct those problems.
   In that sense, recessions are really the launching pads for the
good days to follow.

   The Curatolas owned a fixer-upper with a
romantic wraparound porch. They had a jeep-style car with the
requisite two kids in back, summer barbecues for friends, and
chirping crickets to serenade them at night.
   It was a suburban dream, and the New York couple hated it.
   ``We had all these ideals about what we wanted in a home,'' said
Gerry Curatola. ``Rolling hills and country roads, lots of acreage.
It was very romantic ... but it wasn't reality. The suburbs weren't
home.''
   Many middle-class families have chosen to move away from
Manhattan, where violence is on the rise and everything else often
seems in decline. But for the Curatolas, the city was home - crime,
dirt, noise and all.
   ``The most important element of anywhere you live is time
together as a family,'' Curatola, a dentist, said recently.
``That's the important priority - not commuting, fixing the house,
doing this or doing that.''
   Curatola and his wife, Georgia, moved back into the city last
spring after fewer than four years in their Westchester County
dream house. They couldn't take the ``good life'' any longer.
   For every leisurely weekend in their backyard, Gerry had at
least 10 new 1{-hour commutes notched on his briefcase. For every
pleasant morning with her husband, Georgia endured many long,
lonely afternoons.
   ``I think women in particular are very affected by a move like
that,'' said Mrs. Curatola, whose young daughter and son provided
her some relief. ``I don't play tennis and I don't do clubs.''
   Without those suburban mainstays, she said, the isolation
sometimes was overwhelming. Her days were taken up in solitary
journeys to the market, the dry cleaners, to her 6-year-old
daughter's school.
   On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where the couple now lives,
neighbors meet on the elevator. Standing in line at the bank or at
the deli, there's always something to joke about. Central Park is
the family's backyard.
   The Curatolas know the streets are dangerous and that the public
schools are a mess. But they also know Fifth Avenue's Christmas
lights, the Guggenheim Museum's art and Carnegie Hall's music.
There's nothing like Little Italy's pasta or the charm of Greenwich
Village on a blustery fall day.
   The Curatolas want their children to experience the city's
wonderful mishmash of ethnicities and eccentricities - the very
things the Mitzners miss.
   Barbara and Marvin Mitzner, both 44, had their child in mind
when they moved to the New York suburb of Pound Ridge six years
ago.
   ``We thought the school systems were so excellent. But they
aren't what they're pumped up to be,'' said Mrs. Mitzner, whose
5{-year-old daughter is attending private school. ``The local
kindergarten was appalling.''
   The unsatisfactory schools wouldn't be so bad on their own, Mrs.
Mitzner said. But add in the many meals her huband arrives home too
late to share, the perpetual home repairs, aloof neighbors, the
driving everywhere all the time.
   ``Pound Ridge is ... a lovely, lovely place. But it isn't all
it's cracked up to be, particularly for a couple that has grown up
with the excitement of city life,'' said Marvin Mitzner, a partner
at the New York law firm of Davidoff &amp; Malido.
   ``Getting out of the city didn't turn out to be what we thought
it might,'' he said, adding that a lot of his friends shared
similar feelings.
   There are no statistics on the number of families abandoning the
suburbs. But the Mitzners, who have put their home on the market,
are among a group of suburbanites disillusioned by their
experience.
   Demographers predicted two decades ago that the baby boomers
would choose either rural or urban lifestyles. This rebellious
generation, sociologists theorized, would settle anywhere but in
the suburbs where they were raised.
   The experts were wrong. When working couples started families in
the 1980s, many of those who could afford to opted for the suburbs
as a practical compromise between city and country living.
   It's a forumula that hasn't worked for everyone.
   ``We were making enough money where we wanted to make an
investment,'' said Deborah Hassan, who with her husband chose the
the New York suburb of Scarsdale, where the median home price is
$535,000. ``Within a month after we moved out there, our neighbors
put up a fence. It felt so isolated.''
   Before the year was out, the Hassans and their 3-year-old
daughter were back in Manhattan. ``It's not easy living in the city
with a kid,'' said Mrs. Hassan, who works part time at American
Express.
   ``But I have this feeling about the city,'' she said. ``There's
always someone in the park for my daughter to play with.''

   Dr. Glenn Fishman and his wife, Joanne
Wallenstein, wanted to stick it out in New York. But the city wore
them down.
   Their car was broken into eight times in 12 months. They were
mugged, hassled by homeless beggars, frightened on the subway at
night. They didn't want to witness the final urban terror: murder.
   More than a home, the couple and their two young children
finally sought a haven here, in this gabled suburb about 40 minutes
from New York by train.
   ``We feel bad abandoning the city,'' said Fishman, a researcher
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ``But the problems seem to
be growing at such a clip that a lot of people ... are finding it's
a good time to make a move.''
   Added his wife, Joanne: ``It's sad for the city.''
   There is much for the city to mourn. Statistics usually reserved
for Harlem and Flatbush are touching ``safe'' neighborhoods. It is
more difficult for people to ignore the violence, step over the
many beggars in their path.
   New York's welfare caseload numbers 830,000 - greater than the
population of all but America's 10 largest cities. Someone is
robbed every six minutes and an average of 366 cars are stolen
daily. Among the subway users, about 200,000 jump the turnstiles
and ride free each day.
   ``Violence is reaching people it never reached before,'' said
Ellen Kaidanow, 30, an executive recruiter for The Gap Inc.
   ``It used to be that there were certain parts of Manhattan where
you felt relatively safe,'' said Mrs. Kaidanow, who is looking for
a suburban home where she and her husband can start a family. ``Now
the violence could be anywhere.''
   It is this sense of randomness that drives many couples back to
the secure, relatively quiet suburban lifestyle they knew as
children and, in many cases, swore off as young adults.
   The U.S. Census Bureau doesn't break down New York metropolitan
area migration, but suburban real estate agents say that weary
urban couples looking for a change lately have given their slumping
market a modest boost.
   ``Many think the city isn't getting any better and a lot ...
think it's going to get worse,'' said Merritt Mitchell, president
of the Westchester Multiple Listings Service. ``A lot of young
couples are looking to get out.''
   But along with the contents of their apartments, many ex-New
Yorkers end up bringing a sense of guilt with them to the suburbs,
where homes cost between $175,000 and $450,000. Their consciences
suggest it would be nobler to stay and fight for the city's future.
   ``But you have to look at it from a standpoint of
self-preservation,'' said Marc Tartell, 36, advertising director at
A&amp;W Brands Inc. ``Things felt out of control.''
   As the Tartells were packing up a moving van bound for
Westchester County in September, someone stole two suitcases
stuffed with their children's baby clothes. The theft was a final
kick in the pants, a reminder of why the longtime New Yorkers were
getting out.
   ``I like city living. I just don't like living in New York
anymore,'' said Barbara Tartell, 31, a vice president at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. ``The presence of undesirable people is becoming more
obvious.''
   Jobless, angry, addicted young people used to hang out near the
Tartell's home on the Upper West Side. Their 3-year-old son already
was asking about prostitution, crack cocaine and homelessness.
   Their new two-story, five-bedroom colonial home is altogether
different. The kids have a backyard now, trees to swing from, a
street made for ``kick the can'' and neighborhood pals ready to
play such games.
   Local taxes are higher, but the public schools in Scarsdale
aren't overcrowded and underfunded like those in the city. And the
$7,500 kindergarten tuition the Tartells faced in New York was
anything but cheap.
   New suburbanites say they wish their kids could grow up with the
city's energy, culture and diversity. But those things mean
nothing, parents say, if their children are frightened,
stressed-out, constantly on edge.
   ``It's a fight or flight situation,'' said Charlie Clough, an
abstract artist who shares a Greenwich Village townhouse with his
wife and their two young sons. ``It's palpable ... these are real
bullets going by.''
   Clough and his wife, Liz Trovato, started thinking about a move
after a sniper opened fire at their 10-year-old son's Little League
game.
   ``There I am, lying on the street with bullets whizzing overhead
and my son freaking out,'' said Trovato, a graphic designer. ``It
started us wondering whether there isn't a better way to live.''

   Zhou Lihong, seven months pregnant, has no home
of her own and shares a tiny room in a company dormitory with two
other wome. Her husband, who works for the same firm, lives
upstairs.
   The company offered part of an old house that had no gas, heat
or plumbing, but the young couple rejected it, gambling that a
better offer would come. They have no guarantees.
   While the Zhous wait and hope, suitable apartments are empty.
   One is in the name of Yan Fields, a Chinese woman who followed
her American husband to the United States four years ago, and rents
for the equivalent of just $1 a month.
   It is too valuable to give up and her parents don't want to
sublet for fear of attracting attention that might cause them to
lose the apartment.
   Housing problems are most acute in the major cities. Officials
said one-fourth of Bee.
   Government programs have had limited success in improving the
situation.
   In 1988, a few cities began raising rents and selling apartments
to tenants to finance construction of more housing, but the reforms
have not been applied nationwide. Many local officials blocked
them, unwilling to pay the higher rents or lose the power they get
from assigning scarce apartments.
   Housing officials insist the reforms have not been abandoned.
They say 30 counties and 19 cities, including parts of Beijing,
Shanghai and Canton, are following the new policies on a limited
scale.
   Nearly everyone in China has a roof over his head, but he shares
it with many more people than Americans do.
   The average living area for a Chinese is 81 square feet,
according to government figures. In the United States, says the
National Association of Homebuilders, the average person has 755
square feet.
   A Shanghai newspaper wrote about a couple who lived in a single
room with an aging father.
   After four years of marriage, they remained childless and the
husband was convinced lack of privacy was the reason. They borrowed
an apartment for five months and the wife became pregnant.
   Employers determine whether a young couple get their own
apartment. Companies distribute housing by seniority, and both
husband and wife have a chance to be assigned an apartment by their
respective employers.
   A worker who has connections to the company housing official may
get a larger apartment than he needs. Rents are so low there is no
reason not to obtain as much space as possible.
   Rents for an average three-room apartment in Beijing range from
the equivalent of 34 cents a month to $1.14.
   Officials say the average Chinese spends less than 1 percent of
his income on housing, compared with 15 percent in the United
States. In the late 1950s, Chinese spent 6 percent to 10 percent of
income on rent and officials want to return to that level by the
end of this decade.
   ``Rent is so low that it takes years to recover'' a new
building's cost, said Zhang Yuanduan, director of the Construction
Ministry's real estate department.
   Most new buildings soon begin deteriorating because rent often
doesn't even pay the cost of maintenance, and Chinese are being
born at the rate of more than 30 a minute, too fast for new
construction to keep pace.
   In outlying parts of Beijing and some companies where the
housing reforms are being introduced, rents have risen to the
equivalent of $6.30 a month for a three-room apartment.
   The city built 314 new apartments and offered them for sale at
prices much closer to the real cost - an average of $18,250, or 40
times the average annual wage - said Liu Qi, deputy director of
Beijing's Housing Reform Office.
   Buyers snapped up the apartments, borrowing money from relatives
abroad or taking out bank loans.
   Liu said some companies in Beijing were following suit and had
sold nearly 4,000 apartments to workers in the past two years,
generally at lower prices than the city. Proceeds are used to
renovate old housing and build new apartments.
   A local government in Liaoning, northeastern China, earned
enough from selling apartments and raising rents to build 120 new
dormitories in less than three years. In the past, it had been able
to build only one or two in the same period, said Zhang of the
Construction Ministry.

<HEAD>165 U.N. Workers Missing or Detained, 10 Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA BRYSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day in 1979, Bismillah Kamkai was
taken from his U.N. Development Program office in Kabul,
Afghanistan, under armed guard. He was never heard from again.
   Belay Melake, an Ethiopian statistician working for a U.N.
economic agency in Addis Ababa, disappeared more than 11 years ago.
His colleagues believe his government tortured and killed him.
   British journalist Alec Collett was abducted south of Beirut in
1985 while on assignment for the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees. In 1986, his kidnappers
claimed to have killed him in retaliation for the U.S. air raid on
Libya, but no body was found.
   U.N. staff members say 10 of their colleagues have been killed,
including Kamkai and Melake. Collett is among 165 listed as missing
or detained around the world.
   Ninety-nine of those detained are Arab relief workers held by
Israeli authorities in the occupied Gaza Strip or West Bank,
according to the U.N. employee union.
   Much attention has focused on Western hostages in the Middle
East, but little has been paid to the scores of detained U.N.
employees. Most are low-level employees of relief and development
agencies who are citizens of the countries where they work.
   ``These people are working for the world community and it's
surprising that there's not more compassion,'' said Lori Berliner,
who for a decade has led a committee of international civil
servants pressing for the release of those detained. ``We worry
about staff being forgotten.''
   Israel accuses the Arab U.N. workers it holds of ``subversive
activities,'' said Lowell Flanders, president of the U.N. staff
union. But he added, ``They're not terrorists.'' Many were
teachers, guards or drivers in Palestinian refugee camps.
   About 20 governments or organizations have been accused of
killing U.N. employees or detaining them illegally. Flanders
described Ethiopia as one of the most serious offenders because of
reports the government has tortured and killed prisoners.
   He said he had independent reports that Ghennet Mebrahtu, a
widow with two children employed by the World Health Organization
in Addis Ababa, had been tortured since her arrest in August.
   An Ethiopian delegate told a U.N. committee in November that
Mrs. Mebrahtu was arrested for activities ``not consistent'' with
her U.N. duties and would be tried soon. He did not elaborate.
   The U.N. staff union insists U.N. workers be afforded due
process: open hearings, written charges and the right to legal
counsel, as provided for in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has demanded
repeatedly that the rights of U.N. staff members be respected.
   ``At a time when the organization is being called upon to
undertake greater responsibilities in various parts of the world,
it is totally unacceptable that ... staff members are subjected to
arbitrary or unexplained detention, abduction, or even have their
lives placed at risk,'' he said recently.
   U.N. committees and member states also have said the matter is
urgent, but the staff union wants action.
   It has demanded a halt to all U.N. activities, except for
humanitarian aid, in any country that illegally detains U.N.
workers. U.N. officials and delegates say there is little chance of
that.
   Mahmoud Tarjouman, a Syrian arrested by his government in 1976
before he could begin work for a U.N. economic commission in
Lebanon, said the United Nations did not work for his release
during nine years of imprisonment.
   No U.N. official ever contacted his wife, and his salary was
stopped after 1{ years, Tarjouman said.
   He said his support for multiparty democracy may have caused his
arrest by President Hafez Assad's government.
   Tarjouman was neither charged or tried, and returned to the
United Nations after his release. He now works as an editor in New
York and U.N. officials are considering his request for back pay.
   U.N. workers accept that their duties involve risk, Flanders
said, ``but at the same time, they expect that if they do encounter
difficulties, the organization would support them.''
   Reasons for detentions are many.
   Some U.N. workers simply were caught up in unrest. Among the 10
believed slain are Fernando Olivares-Mori and Carmelo Soria
Espinosa, seized in the 1970s in Chile under the military regime of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Some may have been victims of attempts to frustrate U.N.
activity. In 1987-1989, the communist government of Nicolai
Ceausescu refused to let a professor working for the United Nations
leave Romania to report on human rights.

<HEAD>Records Produced For WWII-Era Servicemen Now Available to All</HEAD>

   The recording sessions were held in Quonset
huts, on movie sets, in night clubs after hours. Some of the
biggest names in show business, from old-timers like Al Jolson to
newcomers like Frank Sinatra, performed.
   But the records, produced in a six-year period during and after
World War II, were heard only by American servicemen overseas. Now,
through the efforts of a retired Navy officer who helped oversee
their production, they are on the U.S. market.
   Nearly 920 12-inch, 78-rpm records were produced by the Army and
Navy from 1943 through 1949 as morale boosters. They were called
V-Discs. The records - 8 million copies altogether - were
accompanied by 125,000 spring-operated windup phonographs, each
with 100 steel needles.
   ``They were played on ships, in foxholes, in trenches, on
airplanes, in hospitals,'' said Edmond P. DiGiannantonio. Digi, as
he is known, ran the Navy's part of the program and keeps a
well-preserved copy of each record in a closet in his lakeside home
here.
   One serviceman wrote a letter saying he and his buddies were
playing a V-Disc as they headed to the D-Day invasion of Normandy,
DiGiannantonio said.
   The program was started after an Army musical branch captain
named Bob Vincent suggested to Army officials in Washington that
they get popular band leaders like Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw to
record for the troops.
   The colonel, Vincent's superior, said, ``Look, these guys don't
want to hear any swing music or any jazz; they want marching
music,'' DiGiannantonio recalled.
   The colonel's reluctance was overcome and ``we went on to
include all types of music in all releases,'' said DiGiannantonio.
``From Toscanini to Spike Jones. All the way.''
   When the Navy started looking for an officer to run the Navy,
Marine Corps and Coast Guard part of the program, DiGiannantonio
was in a hospital in Boston, recovering from wounds he suffered
when his ship, the heavy cruiser Vincennes, was sunk off
Guadalcanal.
   He had played violin, piano and saxophone in high school in
Boston and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, held a
broadcast engineer's license and had recorded Shaw, Glenn Miller,
Goodman and other band leaders when they came to town.
   So he got the job.
   Along with each box of 20 or 30 records went copies of a
questionnaire asking the servicemen to say what kind of music they
wanted. ``White Christmas'' was the most requested piece. About 60
percent wanted jazz or swing, 20 percent or so classical and some
country and western or others. Marches didn't make it.
   Some of the music came from movie film tracks and transcriptions
of radio broadcasts, but many were live recordings by artists
donating their services.
   During the early years, they were the only records made. The
American Federation of Musicians, at odds with the recording
companies over royalties, had banned all recording until the
dispute was settled. Union President James Caesar Petrillo waived
the ban to permit the recordings for the troops.
   ``We recorded in night clubs, hotel ballrooms, movie studios,
Quonset huts, Army bases, Navy bases, wherever the artists were,''
said DiGiannantonio, now 73.
   ``In those days when you went on a job you traveled by bus all
night. They'd do a session and wind up at one or two in the
morning, and then come to a studio and lug all the instruments and
record for us.''
   The services had tried sending shellac records overseas earlier,
but found that most of them were broken before they arrived. The
V-discs were recorded on more durable vinylite. When vinylite
became scarce because it was critically needed for insulation, they
switched to Formvar, a product developed in Canada.
   Instructions on changing needles were often ignored, so many of
the records wore out overseas. Others were left behind when the war
ended. DiGiannantonio said that when the V-disc program ended,
officials ordered the remaining disks destroyed to prevent
commercial use.
   Nevertheless, the Library of Congress has a nearly complete set.
Their quality ``ranges from very good to poor, depending on the
source,'' said music librarian Sam Brylawski.
   ``Remember how heavy those old needles were,'' said Brylawski.
``That would gouge a record like a V-disc. If we got one from
someone who really liked their recording a lot, it could very well
be beat up.''
   DiGiannantonio took good care of his.
   They have been transferred to cassettes and compact discs, with
no adjustment of the original sound.
   ``Some people said let's enhance it, and do this or this,'' said
DiGiannantonio. ``But we said this is the way it was, and we are
going to do it that way.''
   DiGiannantonio said he has clearance from the Defense Department
to market the recordings, and is working with the American
Federation of Musicians and Broadcast Music Inc. about payment of
royalties.
   He said much of the profit will go to the musicians' union
retirement fund, or to the artists, their families, or their
estates.
   The first installment is a three-cassette set with 37 numbers
including Glenn Miller playing ``Chattanooga Choo Choo,'' Jolson
singing ``Mammy'' and Connie Boswell crooning ``Good Night,
Sweetheart.''

   He flunked trigonometry as a boy.
Yet John Saxon now presents himself as the savior of math
education, delighted to brand the nation's math experts as
incompetents.
   The ``math establishment'' - the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics and top state math officials - is to blame for U.S.
teen-agers scoring last in international comparisons of numerical
skills, Saxon charges.
   ``It is only in math education where people who are abject
failures are called experts,'' says Saxon, whose back-to-basics
math textbooks have been rejected by several states and whose blunt
personality leaves even supporters cringing.
   ``They can point to no success in math education in 30 years and
yet they call themselves experts.''
   Many in the ``establishment'' do, indeed, oppose many of Saxon's
methods - and they don't much like this former test pilot and
junior college teacher turned math textbook publisher, either.
   But interviews with teachers around the country make it clear
that this math maverick from Oklahoma has tapped into widespread
discontent over math education and is causing educators to rethink
how the subject should be taught in U.S. classrooms.
   Since 1982, Saxon has sold some $20 million worth of his texts
to 3,000 schools around the country - from Arizona reservation
schools to affluent suburban schools outside Chicago, Minneapolis
and metropolitan New York.
   And he's done it without the customary sales force most school
textbook publishers employ.
   Instead, he's run acerbic ads in education trade journals,
offered free texts to schools willing to test them, and encouraged
his legions of teacher-supporters to help spread his grass-roots
math movement.
   Saxon's philosophy lies in his fourth grade through high school
textbook series that he hopes will banish three decades of ``new
math'' and replace it with a ``practice, practice, practice''
regimen of basic skills.
   Or, as he put it in an interview, ``I beat math into the little
buggers.''
   Saxon's latest battleground is this affluent Long Island suburb,
where parents, believing that the state-mandated math curriculum
was leaving their kids ill-equipped for college math, overcame
opposition from state curriculum authorities and won permission to
become the first in New York state to test Saxon's approach.
   This fall, Saxon's brand of math began a closely watched,
three-year trial in two beginning algebra classes at South
Huntington's Walt Whitman High School.
   But here and elsewhere, it's too early to tell if the Saxon
approach will do all it claims: boost test scores, keep students in
math longer, and make U.S. students world leaders in math skills.
   One of the few serious studies, conducted with Pittsburgh
students in 1987, found that Saxon yielded no test gains compared
with other books. And all students did poorly on problem-solving
skills regardless of the texts used.
   Saxon is hard to categorize. His texts blend rote math drill and
constant repetition of lessons previously learned - similar to the
Japanese ``kumon'' method that helped make that country a math
leader.
   The Algebra I text, for example, has no chapters, but 132
``lessons,'' each focusing on a particular skill - graphing
inequalities, for example. Students work on 30 or so practice
problems. But unlike traditional texts, the vast majority of
practice questions deal with previous lessons learned.
   It's as if students are reviewing for their math finals from the
first day of the school year.
   Unlike many math experts, Saxon frowns on students using hand
calculators, especially in elementary grades.
   And Saxon teachers are expected to act as coaches rather than
lecturers, and employ other progressive classroom practices such as
cooperative learning.
   In sum, Saxon seems to offer a new way to teach the ``old
math.''
   As might be expected, leading math educators haven't taken
kindly to being told by this prickly outsider that they've been
doing it all wrong for decades.
   Curriculum officials and some classroom teachers in New York,
Minnesota, Texas, California, Idaho and even his home state of
Oklahoma insist Saxon is trying to march mathematics education
backwards.
   Saxon may teach students how to compute a square root, they say,
but his texts neglect problem-solving skills, ignore key areas like
probabilities and statistics, and generally fail to connect
classroom math to a changing technological world.
   ``It appears Saxon wants students to perform quick and accurate
calculations. He has a behaviorist point of view: learning through
constant repeating. The rest of us believe that you build knowledge
through prior understanding,'' said Elizabeth Stage, chairwoman of
California's curriculum commission.
   ``There's no application to anything in real life. Students wind
up more like trained monkeys,'' said Nancy Guldberg, a math teacher
at Eden Prairie High School in suburban Minneapolis, which has used
the Saxon texts for six years but now is almost certain to drop
them because students disliked the texts and test scores
languished.
   But Mel Twitchell, who has used Saxon to teach his four math
sections at Utah's Provo High School for the last three years, is
among many others who swear the texts are making students enjoy
math so much that they stick with it through calculus.
   Twitchell said it's too soon to point to big test gains. But at
Provo, only two sections of students now take dumbed-down
``consumer'' math, compared with six sections before Saxon, he
said. And calculus enrollment is up, from 38 students before Saxon,
to 107 studets.
   Nine weeks into the Saxon experiment at South Huntington,
parents, teachers and students seem to like what they see.
   Walk into John Cardon's Algebra I class and you'll see a teacher
who lectures for just 10 minutes, then lets his 26 students work
alone or help each other with long lists of review questions.
   Cardon's students are uniformly positive, even though the
homework load is heavy.
   ``It's easier,'' said Kerri Ball, a 14-year-old freshman. ``Last
year, my grades were in the 70s. Now I'm scoring in the 80s.''
   Saxon's first-ever foothold in New York is, in itself, an
extraordinary accomplishment in a state where only two or three
high school textbooks conform to the unusually rigid high school
math curriculum.
   The New York breakthrough is the more remarkable because it
happened in a school district where 95 percent of the students
already were passing their state exams.
   But Cardon said the state-required curriculum had students
glossing over many facets of math while neglecting the skills
needed to really understand them.
   ``They made the courses so easy in order to attract more kids.
But they wound up learning a little bit about a lot of things, but
knowing nothing,'' he said.
   Buoyed by such grass-roots support, Saxon shows no signs of
mellowing as the nation's leading math gadfly.
   ``My critics will tell you I'm not nice, and I will say they are
incompetent,'' he said.
   One critic, Cathy Seeley, the state director of mathematics in
Texas, said Saxon refuses to concede there could be more than one
way to teach math. Texas rejected Saxon's texts for state adoption
in 1983, 1989 and again last month.
   ``The `establishment' is anyone who disagrees with Saxon,'' Ms.
Seeley said. ``In truth, there have been many unpleasant people who
have had good things to offer in education. In this case, it's
someone who's saying their way is the only way to do something.''
   ``It's the personal and professional demeaning that I find
amazing,'' said Stage, the California official.
   ``What difference does it make if I'm a horse's ass?'' Saxon
responds. ``What difference does it make if they like me? I have
threatened their raison d'etre. The math experts are a lot more
human than I hoped they'd be.''

<HEAD>Du Pont Fiber Workers Come Up Empty On Yearend Payout</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-The New Workplace I</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Workers in Du Pont Co.'s fibers
division, who tied their pay raises to profits under a special
incentive plan, had banked on a tidy payout around the holidays.
   But the bank went bust - and so did the experimental program.
   Because the division failed to reach its $725 million annual
profit goal, the department's 20,000 employees, who had as much as
4 percent of their pay at risk, won't see any extra payouts or
bonuses at the end of this year.
   Du Pont also decided to scrap the innovative three-year plan in
its second year after several employees cried foul. Beginning in
January, employee wages and raises will be paid in the traditional
way.
   James F. Kearns, who heads the fibers division, said employees
weren't ready for a pay-at-risk program.
   ``It was fine when they were getting more back than they put in,
which was the case last year. But when they found out they were not
going to get back as much as they invested, it began to come out
`No, this is not fair,''' Kearns said.
   The pay incentive plan was mandatory for non-union employees at
the department's 10 nationwide plants. Four of the five plants that
have unions also agreed to participate.
   Here's how the plan worked:
   Employees this year ``gambled'' as much as 4 percent of their
annual pay that the division would reach its $725 million goal.
Last year, it was as much as 2 percent on a $670 million goal.
   An employee with an annual salary of $30,000 this year could
have received a one-time payout of as much as $1,200 if the goal
was met. His regular salary, however, wasn't touched if the goal
wasn't met.
   Last year, that same employee with the same salary earned an
extra $600 since the goal was met, plus a small bonus because the
target was exceeded.
   The Du Pont program was designed to give employees a stake in
the department's profits to help improve the fibers business. The
theory was that such a plan would make employees feel they owned
part of the company, encouraging them to become more efficient and
to find cost-saving ways to do their jobs.
   But the fibers business, which represents nearly a quarter of Du
Pont's total profits, has been hurt by a rise in foreign
competition and raw materials costs.
   Through the third quarter of this year, Du Pont's fibers
division earned $400 million, about $100 million off from the same
time last year. The company predicts that fourth quarter net income
will be lower than the $191 million earned in the 1989 quarter and,
therefore, well below the $725 million goal.
   Under the plan, employees also could have received half of what
was at risk if the department achieved 80 percent of this year's
profit goal, or $580 million.
   But Kearns, the fibers division head, said it would take a
``heroic effort'' to reach that goal by year's end.
   When the pay plan was announced in the fall of 1988, chemical
industry analysts said it was trend-setting. But in a slumping
economy, it's not a popular plan.
   ``I thought it was a pretty bold move. ... (But) workers want
stability in their job and compensation, and from that standpoint
it may have been too bold a move,'' said James H. Wilbur, an
industry analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Granny Flats: Rent-a-Cottage in the Yard for Granny?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

   Dilemma: Your grandparents can't keep up their big house and
they don't want to move to a retirement home.
   Solution: A portable, factory-built four-room cottage that fits
in the back yard.
   Developer J. Robert Gillette says the cottages are America's
answer to Australia's ``granny flats.''
   The cottages, which can be hooked to utilities in the main home,
sell for about $50,000 or rent for $600 to $700 a month. The
relatives are nearby but not crowding the family.
   Gillette wants the first cottages to be built on the grounds of
senior citizens' complexes. Cottage occupants will have more
privacy, and pay less, than residents of the complex itself, but
still have easy access to social events, meals and services such as
laundry.
   Trial programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas and California
show that what the American Association of Retired Persons calls
the Elder Cottage Housing Opportunity can work.
   ``It's very cozy,'' Pauline Wessner, 85, said from the ECHO
cottage she's lived in for two years near Belvedere, N.J.
   Wessner's grandson thought of her when the county's Office on
Aging announced an ECHO trial program. He had bought the house
where she lived for nearly 40 years, and she had moved to an
apartment, she said. ``It was too much work for me to mow the grass
and everything else.''
   ``I live right next door to my grandson now, about 45 feet from
his house,'' she said.
   The county bought the cottage and leases it to her for an amount
based on her Social Security income. She has a bedroom, bathroom,
parlor and fully equipped kitchen.
   Probably not more than 100 of the little houses have been set up
nationally, said Leah Dobkin of the AARP in Washington. But the
AARP has published outlines for developers and local governments of
the zoning, parking and other issues the cottages raise.
   It's better than backing a trailer in, Dobkin said. ``These are
specially designed for the elderly, and they meet all housing
codes,'' she said.
   Gillette's cottage plans show ramps for people who don't want to
climb stairs, wide doors, bathtub rails, and kitchen sinks minus
the usual cabinets underneath that keep wheelchair users at arm's
length.
   Gillette said he'll erect four cottages at the American House
Dearborn Heights, Mich., complex by spring.
   That the cottages are detached is a key for senior citizens like
Wessner, who want to live near their families, but not in the same
house.
   ``That wouldn't go,'' Wessner said. ``They have two teen-agers,
who like loud music. Grandma's a little too old for that now.''
   But the cottage avoids the loneliness of long-distance living.
   ``My grandson stops in every morning with the newspaper for me.
They invite me over, which I appreciate. I go over there on Sunday
for coffee and a bun.''
   And on holidays, she said, ``We eat together. Unless I'm invited
somewhere else.''

   MCA Inc., one of America's most
precious entertainment gems, will be acquired by Japanese business
giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. in a $6.6 billion deal
that firmly establishes Japan's presence in Hollywood moviemaking.
   Even at that huge price tag - the largest ever for a Japanese
purchase of a U.S. company - the deal announced Monday was mildly
disappointing to investors who had been anticipating the purchase
since it was first rumored in September.
   The deal figures out to about $71 per MCA share, and the
takeover-starved market had been hoping for something closer to
$90.

   MOSCOW (AP) - The Kremlin says it wants to slash foreign aid by
75 percent and defense spending by 10 percent in next year's
budget, which for the first time makes a distinction between
national and republic revenues.
   Communist countries including Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia, North
Korea and Angola likely would be hard hit by the cutback. Deputy
Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin also told the lawmakers on Monday
that real estate, stocks and currency would be sold in the Soviet
Union for the first time next year.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Two airline tickets for the price one of might
sound pretty good to anybody about to go on vacation, but analysts
warn that the freebies could escalate into a harmful fare war if
carriers aren't careful.
   ``Things like this tend to spread like wildfire,'' said Raymond
E. Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. ``If they
can control the number of seats, with black-out periods, then the
damage can be controlled.''
   The latest gimmick for filling seats comes as airlines have been
hit hard by rising fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis
and a downturn in the economy that has kept demand for air travel
sluggish.

   BERLIN (AP) - Thousands of rail workers in eastern Germany have
walked off the job demanding protection from layoffs caused by
unification, and the strike disrupted travel in neighboring

   The strike was the first major walkout since the Germanys united

eastern Germany Monday, forcing some trans-European express trains
to stop in Czechoslovakia.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has refused to shield a
whooping cough vaccine manufacturer from a lawsuit that said
company negligence caused brain damage in an inoculated infant.
   The court, without comment, on Monday rejected an appeal by
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to stop the suit. Michelle Graham was
given the vaccine in 1980 when she was a few months old. Soon
after, she was diagnosed as suffering from severe brain damage that
causes retardation.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department says that it won $257
million in fiscal 1990 from defense contractors and other companies
accused in civil suits of defrauding the government.
   The amount, announced Monday, has risen substantially since
Congress approved amendments to the False Claims Act in 1986
authorizing the government to recover triple damages. The Justice
Department collected only $27 million in fiscal 1985 through
judgments and settlements of civil fraud cases.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has refused to end an
affirmative action program aimed at awarding more public works
contracts to businesses run by minorities and women.
   In its decision on Monday, the court rejected an appeal by
companies that said the Tampa, Fla.-area program is
unconstitutional because it condones reverse discrimination against
white men. The affirmative action program was adopted in 1984 by
Hillsborough County,which set a goal of awarding 25 percent of the
value of all annual construction contracts to businesses owned by
women and minorities.

   The buyer of U.S. entertainment conglomerate MCA
Inc. has come a long way since its founder, Konosuke Matsushita,
made Japanese home life a bit easier by popularizing the rice
cooker.
   Now Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. has set its sights
on dominating the promised next generation of electronic
entertainment - high-definition television - with the help of MCA's
rich vault of movies and television shows and studios with which to
make more.
   Matsushita (pronounced mat-SOOS-shtuh) needed MCA to keep up
with electronics and entertainment rival Sony Corp. in their
dead-heat battle over the video and HDTV fields, analysts say.
   The MCA buyout is valued at $6.6 billion, compared with the $5
billion Sony paid for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. last
year.
   Unlike Sony, Matsushita is not a household name outside Japan,
although its popular brand names Panasonic, Technics and Quasar are
widely known.
   Matsushita is Japan's largest home electronics manufacturer and
third-largest corporation, with 163 consolidated subsidiaries.
Fortune magazine ranked Matsushita in 1989 as the 16th biggest
corporation in the world.
   The Osaka-based company reported holdings of more than $10
billion in cash alone last year, and it earned $1.48 billion on
sales of $37.8 billion.
   The influence of legendary founder Konosuke Matsushita, who died
last year at age 94, is felt in virtually every Japanese home where
an automatic rice cooker takes the drudgery out of preparing the
nation's staple food.
   Matsushita, a man who never went to high school yet became
Japan's most famous entrepreneur, popularized the electric
appliance in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy:
``To manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant
supply, thereby enriching and improving life for everyone.''
   That creed in 1932 came less than 15 years after 23-year-old
Matsushita left his employer, an electric power company, to
capitalize on his own two-way electric socket. Today, the
Matsushita empire has spawned nearly 500 related firms in 37
countries.
   During the 37 years it has operated in the United States,
Matsushita has built 12 factories and established seven sales
companies and a research facility that employ about 10,000 people.
   Matsushita's huge size, including its 25,000 affiliated
retailers in Japan, has proved a disadvantage in switching from
low-growth consumer products, which generate 60 percent of its
sales, to more profitable fields.
   Its inability to produce a new hit product to replace the
blockbuster video cassette recorder reflects the company's greater
strength in manufacturing than invention.
   Seeking to overcome its limitations, six years ago Matsushita
launched a long-term plan to focus on seven areas of high
technology, including computers, semiconductors and communications.
   This year, the company invested about $3.2 billion in liquid
crystal computer monitor technology, computers and semiconductors.
It also is trying to develop profitable movie and television
cameras for professional use, said Boris Petersik, an electronics
analyst at Barclay's de Zoete Wedd Securities Japan.
   So far, Matsushita has had a hard time cracking Sony's dominance
in the professional video market.
   Sony also has a head start in the market for entertainment
``software,'' or the movies, TV shows and music played in tape
recorders, laser-disc players and VCRs. Sony achieved this lead
through its purchase of Columbia Pictures last year and its 1987
purchase of CBS Records for $2 billion.
   The entertainment software market is growing faster than the
market for the machines that play it. Most analysts believe that
control of entertainment software is the key to staying ahead in
the electronics field.
   The MCA purchase gives Matsushita access to a repository of
movies and television programs similar to Sony's Columbia cache to
be used with the new HDTV format, which offers dazzlingly detailed
images, digital sound and wider, cinema-style screen proportions.
   ``With that purchase, there's a very good chance they'd get a
fair share of the HDTV market. They'll be glad to have something to
run on those gadgets,'' Petersik says.

   The story of MCA Inc. reads like a Hollywood fairy tale, about a
fledgling company that grew from a tiny jazz promoter into a
conglomerate of movie studios, theme parks, a big-name record label
and a publishing house.
   The entertainment colossus now represents a chunk of American
pop culture, churning out movie icons ranging from ``E.T.'' to
``Jaws'' and making household names out of musicians like Guns N'
Roses and Bobby Brown.
   But Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Japan, which
agreed to purchase MCA on Monday, also bought a company of creative
visionaries whose screen business has sometimes faltered, whose
movies have been swept up in controversy and whose studios recently
were ravaged by fire.
   MCA lived through economic thick and thin to earn a reputation
as a survivor. Today MCA owns Universal Studios, one of America's
biggest record labels, a publishing house, theme parks and big
piece of Los Angeles real estate. It is known for extremely stable
management, notable in a business famous for capricious and
unpredictable excecutive changes.
   The company's transformation was stage-managed over a 65-year
history by a Chicago eye doctor, the late Jules Stein, and Lew
Wasserman, a one-time movie usher from Cleveland. Wasserman, who to
this day is MCA's chairman, and president Sidney J. Sheinberg have
run the company for decades.
   Over the years Universal has produced Academy Award winners such
as ``The Sting,'' ``The Deer Hunter '' and ``Out of Africa.''
   But ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' stirred up an
emotion-charged debate, inciting religious groups to protest what
they called its shameful interpretation of biblical history.
   More recently, the company faced a devastating fire and an
uncertain market for its feature films.
   Early this month an arsonist torched the historic Universal
Studios backlot, gutting sets for ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Back to the
Future'' and an unfinished Sylvestor Stallone movie.
   While Universal television has long been a steady moneymaker,
the film division has endured ups and downs - its dry spells
punctuated by periodic blockbusters like ``E.T.'' ``Jaws,'' ``Back
to the Future,'' ``The Sting,'' ``Animal House,'' ``On Golden
Pond,'' and ``Twins.''
   MCA's storied history has its roots in the jazz business. Stein,
a jazz player himself, decided musicians needed an agency to strike
them better deals with hotels, ballrooms and speakeasies.
   In 1923 he founded the Music Corporation of America, and by the
1930s, MCA represented most of the name bands in the swing era.
   Then Stein set his sights on a bigger talent game: Hollywood.
Stein's chief aid, Wasserman, proved a dynamo as head of MCA's
Hollywood office, and soon the agency represented a long list of
stars, including Joan Crawford, Errol Flynn and Alfred Hitchcock.
   As the major studios shunned television as an upstart
competitor, MCA rushed in with its Revue Productions, grinding out
series like ``M Squad'' and ``Wagon Train.'' When Ronald Reagan's
film career faded, Wasserman found him work as host of ``General
Electric Theater.''
   Until 1959, MCA was known principally as The Octopus because of
its far-reaching influence as a talent agency. Then the company
took a giant step, buying the venerable, faltering Universal
Studio.
   Under Wasserman's guidance, MCA-Universal flourished in the
1970s and 1980s. The company became the biggest supplier of
television entertainment. In addition, Universal Studios Tours grew
to a major tourist attraction.

   The Oak Ridge Boys may boast that ``My
Baby is American Made,'' but their catalogue and that of most other
country music artists belong to foreign investors.
   The planned buyout of MCA Inc. by Japan's Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. in a $6.6 billion deal would leave Nashville's
country music industry with only one major label under an American
banner: Warner Bros.
   The acquisition covers MCA Records and MCA Music, a song
publishing company, and some of the biggest names in country music.
   Reba McEntire, George Strait, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, The
Desert Rose Band, Lionel Cartwright, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,
Conway Twitty, The Bellamy Brothers and Steve Wariner all record
for MCA.
   Officials at MCA Records Nashville wouldn't comment on the sale
or any changes it might bring to their operation, spokeswoman Janet
Rickman said.
   But one industry observer doubts Japanese ownership will change
a note.
   ``Historically, the Nashville divisions have retained their
creative autonomy after changes in ownership,'' said Bill Ivey,
Director of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville.
   The foundation, which operates the Country Music Hall of Fame
museum, is dedicated to preserving the history of country music.
   ``Typically, the bigger corporations place more emphasis on the
bottom line and paperwork, but leave Nashville divisions alone as
far as artistic vision.''
   Foreign investors usually bring a healthy infusion of cash-flow
for Nashville companies they acquire, Ivey said.
   ``There are some benefits to country music in locally owned
operations, but once a company is owned outside of Nashville it
matters little whether that company is based in New York or
Tokyo.''
   Ed Benson of the Country Music Association observed that MCA's
Nashville label has been profitable and probably won't see its
routine change much.
   ``All of the Nashville major labels have been profitable and
successful and one more foreign acquisition probably won't even
change the players,'' said Benson, who is the trade group's
associate executive director.
   Ivey said the character of the industry is changing. It's
getting harder for independent labels to thrive.
   Opryland Records, an independent Nashville label owned by
Opryland USA Inc., recently gave up, Ivey noted.
   ``If you are trying to operate a traditional record company,
signing major acts to multi-album contracts and getting radio play
and selling records at retail, it gets real tough to compete,''
said Ivey.
   ``There's a niche for small labels to market mail order,
perhaps. But there is no room at the top of the charts.''
   Japanese interests control CBS Records, soon to be renamed Sony.
BMG, Capitol-EMI and Mercury-Polydor are owned by Germans, the
English and the Dutch, respectively.

   Concern over a U.S. backlash of anti-Japanese
sentiment surfaced Tuesday in local media comment on Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.'s proposed blockbuster buyout of
entertainment giant MCA Inc.
   Some newspapers and television broadcasters also forecast
intensifying competition over popular television shows, movies and
other broadcast ``software.''
   The nationally-circulated Asahi Shimbun reported that Matsushita
had been eager to finalize the deal before Dec. 7, the 49th
anniversary of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, to avoid
exacerbating U.S. public opinion.
   Matsushita's purchase of MCA in a $6.6 billion deal is the
largest Japanese buyout of an American concern after Sony's $5
billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment last year.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Japan's authoritative,
quasi-public television network, gave the deal prominent early
morning air play. The broadcast featured on-the-street interviews
with New York pedestrians, whose opinions ranged from approval of
the purchase to anxiety about the faltering power of American
companies.
   The Asahi Shimbun played up foreign reaction in a small story
about the Monday news conference in Osaka where the purchase was
announced.
   The story focused on a reporter's question about possible
censorship by MCA's new owners of films critical of Japan. Similar
questions were raised last year in response to the Columbia
Pictures purchase.
   ``I am confident that such works will not be produced because
this purchase itself aims to deepen the cooperation between the
U.S. and Japan,'' Matsushita President Akio Tanii was quoted as
replying.
   An analysis article in the newspaper said Matsushita paid a high
price, probably to avoid a backlash in American public opinion.
   But another major daily, the Mainichi Shimbun, carried a story
from Washington D.C. saying American sentiment was calm, in
contrast to reaction to Sony-Columbia transaction.
   An analysis in the Yomiuri Shimbun, the nation's top-selling
daily, said the purchase underlined the inseparable relationship in
the audiovisual business between the machinery of broadcasting,
from cameras to television sets, and what the machines broadcast.
   Media reports predicted the purchase will fuel competition in
the audiovisual market, which is rapidly expanding due to the
popularity of rental videos and advent of satellite services.
   Japanese businesses have their eyes on Hollywood, at the same
time that the U.S. film industry is seeking financing, Yomiuri
reported.
   Japanese trading and computer firms, meanwhile, have begun
making their own forays into film-making, Yomiuri said.
   The quality of films that MCA produces in the future will
ultimately be key to determining public reception of the deal,
according to the Yomiuri article. ``Matsushita has failed if people
begin to say MCA films have changed because of the purchase,'' an
unidentified film distributor was reported as saying.
   The Asahi Shimbun quoted unidentified sources in business
circles as predicting the deal will be the final major overseas
corporate takeover for Japanese companies, given the downward trend
in the nation's economy.

   Guinness PLC said Tuesday it has reached an
agreement with Asbach and Co. stockholders to acquire 67.5 percent
of the German brandy maker's shares.
   United Distillers, the Guinness division making the purchase,
declined to disclose the price.
   Guinness, which has been expanding its European interests, last
week announced it was buying Spain's largest brewer, La Cruz del
Campo, for about $1 billion.
   The family-owned Asbach, which is based in Rudesheim on the
Rhine river, produces, markets and sells Asbach Uralt brandy, the
leading German premium brandy. Asbach is the largest spirits brand
in the German market.
   The company also distributes Furst Bismarck Doppelkorn, a
premium grain spirit which is the leading domestic Doppelkorn.
   Asbach had sales of 468 million German marks, or $314 million,
in 1989 and net assets of 99 million marks, or $66.4 million. A
profit figure was not available, Guinness said.
   Tony Greener, managing director of United Distillers, said
Asbach will ``significantly strengthen United Distillers' position
and broaden its premiumbranded portfolio in the important German
market.''
   United Distillers will work with Asbach to further develop its
business in the future, Greener said.

<HEAD>Company Seeks Restitution from Ex-Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of Ashland Oil Inc. is
negotiating to repay expenses the company incurred from his scheme
to sell confidential documents to the National Iranian Oil Co.
   ``We do anticipate there will be an agreement,'' John C. Elam, a
lawyer for Ashland, said Monday.
   The former chairman, Orin E. Atkins, faces sentencing Friday in
Manhattan federal court for his role in the scheme. A settlement on
restitution is expected to be announced at the sentencing.
   A call to Atkin's attorney, James Moss, was not returned.
   Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., first made its request for
restitution from Atkins in an Oct. 9 letter to U.S. District Judge
Charles S. Haight, who presides over Atkins' case.
   ``Mr. Atkins, a lawyer, held the very highest position at
Ashland Oil Inc. prior to his resignation,'' Elam wrote. ``We
submit that an individual who has held such a unique position also
has the highest degree of responsibility and, therefore, has the
duty to make restitution.''
   The company did not give a specific amount, asking Haight to set
a ``just and proper'' figure, but did outline the expenditures it
accumulated and the payments made to Atkins during the scheme.
   According to the letter written by Elam, Ashland spent $1.47
million on an internal investigation of Atkins' acts and related
attorneys fees.
   Additionally, Elam said that since October 1981, Ashland has
paid Atkins more than $2.5 million in consulting fees and other
discretionary corporate benefits and more than half a million
dollars in pension benefits.
   Atkins, 66, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in
September 1989 to conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate
with the government.
   He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $500,000
fine when sentenced by U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight.
   Atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but
remained as a paid Ashland consultant, he obtained confidential
documents involving the company's decision not to pay National
Iranian for $283 million in crude oil purchased in 1979.
   Atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the
documents to the Iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit
against Ashland over its nonpayment.
   While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued
Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which
with interest was worth more than $500 million.
   As part of his cooperation with prosecutors, Atkins testified
earlier this year at the trial of an attorney, Charles Barnett, who
was accused of participating in the scheme to sell the Ashland
documents to the Iranian company.
   Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., was acquitted of all charges.
   A third defendant, oil broker Roy Furmark, pleaded guilty to a
role in the conspiracy. Furmark, who was involved in the
Iran-Contra deal, is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court
next week.

<HEAD>Navistar Buys More Of Mexican Truck Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement to supply engines for Mexico's
largest heavy truck builder adds stability to Navistar
International Corp.'s engine manufacturing schedule but is no
guarantee against layoffs, a spokesman said.
   Workforce adjustments depend on a number of variables, including
domestic demand for diesel engines, said Navistar spokesman William
H. Greenhill.
   ``This is an engine that primarily goes in our medium trucks,''
he said, referring to the deal with DINA Camiones that was
announced Monday.
   ``The domestic market has been sort of soft for both medium and
heavy trucks,'' Greenhill said.
   Navistar said it agreed to supply DINA with as many as 5,000
diesel engines annually and more than tripled its stake in DINA to
17 percent.
   Chicago-based Navistar, North America's largest manufacturer of
medium and heavy trucks, did not disclose financial terms of the
agreement.
   Navistar previously owned 5 percent of DINA, a private
corporation created in 1989 as the Mexican government
denationalized key segments of the automotive industry.
   Under the agreement, Navistar's DT 466 family of mid-range
diesel engines will become the standard power source for DINA
medium trucks beginning next spring.
   The engine supply agreement is expected to add 3,000 to 5,000
engines annually to the 50,000 engines produced annually in Melrose
Park, a Chicago suburb.
   ``This obviously solidifies the situation out there,'' Greenhill
said.
   Navistar has blamed soft demand for its poor financial
performance in the past year. The company lost $18 million in its
fiscal first quarter and had earnings declines of more than 75
percent in the second and third quarters.
   Navistar will announce fiscal fourth-quarter results in early
December.
   Michael Bowyer, a Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. securities analyst who
follows Navistar, called the company's increased investment in
Mexico ``a good idea.''
   Mexican demand for medium and heavy trucks combined has risen
from 6,500 vehicles in 1988 to a projected 15,000 in 1990 and is
expected to surpass 20,000 next year, according to Navistar.
   ``Mexico is presently industrializing its economy, and with an
industrialized society there will be a good demand for trucks,''
Bowyer said.
   But he cautioned that industrialization is typically a slow
process that's subject to many roadblocks.
   For 1990 through October, DINA's share of the combined medium
and heavy truck market in Mexico was nearly 50 percent, Navistar
said.

<HEAD>Mazda, Nissan to Offer Driver and Passenger Air Bags</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Front-seat air bags will be a standard fixture
for Mazda Motor Corp. vehicles by 1994 and in all Nissan Motor Co.
Nissan and Infiniti cars by 1993, the automakers say.
   ``Mazda has made a commitment to the safety of our customers,''
Mazda spokesman Fred Aikins said Monday. ``We recognize the value
of air bags as a supplement to the three-point seat belt.''
   Nissan said the company will offer driver-side air bags in most
of its U.S. passenger cars by 1992.
   Mazda will make driver- and passenger-side air bags standard on
some U.S. models beginning in the 1992 model year, the automaker
said. Currently, the company provides a driver's side air bag on
U.S. models of the RX-7 and the sporty MX-5 Miata.
   The automaker also said it is studying the feasibility of adding
air bags to its trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles.
   The only Mazda plant in the United States is in Flat Rock. The
plant makes the 626 4-door sedan, MX-6 coupe and Ford Motor Co.'s
Probe model.
   The air bags, estimated to be in about 300,000 cars marked for
sale in the United States, will be installed in vehicles made in
Japan and in Flat Rock, Aikins said.
   Nissan offered optional driver-side air bags in Pulsar NX models
starting in January 1989. They were standard equipment on Infiniti
Q45 and M30 models introduced in the fall of 1989 and on 1991 300
ZX models introduced this fall.
   The company said it would start offering passenger-side air bags
at the start of the 1992 model year and expand their availability
to all Infiniti models and nearly all Nissan models by 1994.
   The only U.S. Nissan plant is in Smyrna, Tenn. It makes the
Sentra and a pickup truck.
   Chrysler Corp. made driver-side air bags standard starting with
its 1990 models, General Motors Corp. makes them standard on about
15 car lines and Ford Motor Co. puts driver-side air bags on its
major lines, or about 1 million cars.
   By 1993, air bags or passive restraint belts will be required
for front-seat passengers as well as drivers, under federal law.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Trade Deficit Swells to $29.75 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit swelled to $29.75
billion in the July-September quarter, the highest imbalance in a
year, as the Persian Gulf crisis drove up the cost of foreign oil
against a drop in demand for American farm products, the government
said today.
   The Commerce Department said that the trade gap in the third
quarter was a sharp 28.9 percent higher than the $23.10 billion
imbalance in the April-June period. The second quarter deficit had
been the lowest in more than six years.
   The turnaround occurred because imports shot up 5 percent to an
all-time high of $125.91 billion while U.S. exports edged down 0.6
percent to $96.16 billion, reflecting the drop in demand for
American farm products. The deficit is the difference between
imports and exports.
   The July-September imbalance was the largest quarterly deficit
since a $29.80 billion deficit in the same period last year. Since
that time, the deficit had been on a steadily declining path as a
boom in U.S. export sales helped to narrow America's huge trade
deficit and give the economy one of its few bright spots.
   However, since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, economists had
been forecasting that a higher foreign oil bill would translate
into a rising trade deficit, adding one more negative factor to an
economy already flirting with a recession.
   The figures in today's report on merchandise trade calculated on
a balance of payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports.
   The monthly report showed the third quarter deficit rose to
$28.27 billion. The small disparity between the two reports
reflects the fact that the balance of payments report excludes
military sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor
adjustments to the monthly figures.
   The higher July-September deficit reflected a $6.1 billion
increase in imports. Petroleum imports were up $3.5 billion to
$15.7 billion, reflecting a rise in both price and volume.
   Non-petroleum imports were up as well, climbing $2.5 billion to
$110.2 billion as auto imports from Mexico and Canada rose.
   The small drop in exports left them close to their all-time high
of $96.76 billion set in the April-June period. The biggest
weakness came in a 6 percent drop in farm exports, which declined
to $9.7 billion, reflecting lower sales, particularly in Eastern
Europe, of American corn, wheat and soybeans.
   The average price of wheat decreased 12 percent while corn
prices fell by 1 percent. The average price of cotton and soybeans
was each up 1 percent.
   A drop in U.S. exports of aircraft also contributed to the
weakness in exports.
   The largest increase in the deficit was with members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a rise of $2.5
billion to $6.9 billion.
   The trade balance with Western Europe, which had been in surplus
in the second quarter, dropped back into a deficit of $0.6 billion.
   As usual, the largest deficit was with Japan, a $9.7 billion
deficit, which was still $0.7 billion below the second quarter
imbalance and the lowest deficit with Japan since the first quarter
of 1985.

<HEAD>Asia's Growth Regions Expected To Weather U.S. Economic Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By S.L. BACHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asia's so-called ``Little Dragons'' - Taiwan, Hong
Kong, South Korea and Singapore - enjoyed explosive growth in the
'80s thanks largely to soaring exports to a thriving American
market.
   But the Persian Gulf crisis and a looming U.S. recession have
the region worried because both factors are likely to shave
economic growth next year, analysts say.
   Still, unlike the deep U.S. recession of the early 1980s,
analysts predict those nations should fare better this time around
because they managed to diversify their export markets.
   ``The U.S. recession surely will be a big blow to Taiwan's
economy. But we are not as vulnerable this time,'' said Wei
Chi-ling, an international trade professor at National Taiwan
University.
   So far, slackening demand from the United States was cited as a
major factor behind Hong Kong's decision to halve its projected
economic growth rate for this year to 2.5 percent. The United
States is the British colony's second largest trading partner after
neighboring China.
   Softening U.S. demand also is cited for slower growth in
Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea. However, all three countries
have predicted growth rates of 6 percent to 8 percent for this year
and 1991.
   Although the United States remains among the largest export
markets for much of the region, many Asian countries have managed
to reduce their dependence on U.S. consumer demand for their
textiles, electronics and other goods.
   For example, 33 percent of Taiwan's exports were to the United
States last year, compared to nearly 50 percent in 1985. In Hong
Kong, trade with other countries in the region grew eightfold
between 1979 and 1989.
   Japan, the economic powerhouse of Asia, also has been picking up
the slack in demand created by the sluggish U.S. economy.
   ``The Japanese economy is now playing a so-called absorber
(role) for the Asian neighboring nations ... although they are
still dependent on the U.S. market to a great extent,'' said
Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan.
   Bangkok Bank researcher Nimit Notapantawart agreed, saying the
diversification strategy may bring only limited benefits. He notes
that many Southeast Asian countries manufacture similar products
and will face fierce competition.
   Also, diversifying markets, analysts say, cannot erase more
fundamental problems faced by some Asian economies. Among them, a
crisis of confidence in Hong Kong before it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, and the labor unrest and spiralling wages in
South Korea.
   Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's economy is expected to lose some
steam, with most analysts predicting growth of between 4 percent
and 5 percent next year after four years of roughly 5 percent
annual growth.
   A severe labor shortage, the Gulf crisis, and tighter money
policies designed to fight inflation are more to blame for Japan's
slowdown than lagging exports to the United States, experts say.
   ``Japan's growth is more heavily dependent on domestic demand,
so even if export demand goes down, there will not be much
impact,'' said Seiji Shinpo, head of the overseas research
department at the government's Economic Planning Agency.
   China also might ride out a U.S. recession without major
disruption, analysts say.
   Although the United States is China's third largest trading
partner after Japan and Hong Kong, the generally low price of
Chinese manufactured exports could keep the country insulated from
a recession across the Pacific, said Thomas Chan, a college
lecturer specializing in the Chinese economy.
   China's low wages also are drawing investment from Southeast
Asia.
   The Asian nation likely to feel the worst economic blow in the
coming year is the Philippines, where the government recently cut
1990 economic growth projections by nearly half to 3.5 percent.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sent thousands of Philippine
workers home jobless. The loss of their foreign exchange
remittances also depressed the value of the Philippine peso, and
higher oil prices triggered a nationwide strike.

   The Supreme Court today gave federal energy
regulators more power to set electricity rates for 49 million homes
nationwide.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices overturned a ruling that barred the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from slashing rate hikes to
customers in 15 Ohio communities.
   The court, agreeing to do what FERC requested, sent the case
back to a lower court for further study to determine whether the
FERC orders are ``just and reasonable.''
   At issue in today's ruling is the authority shared by FERC and
the Security and Exchange Commission over public utilities and
their subsidiaries.
   The court said a provision of the Federal Power Act governing
overlapping authority between FERC and other agencies does not bar
the energy regulators from seeking to control rates in the Ohio
case.
   FERC said it is trying to prevent public utilities from passing
on to consumers allegedly inflated costs of buying coal and
possibly other goods and services from the companies' subsidiaries.
   The Bush administration supported an appeal by the Ohio
communities.
   The dispute stems from rate hikes first proposed by Ohio Power
Co. in 1982. The utility asked FERC to approve higher rates to
cover the company's cost of buying coal from its subsidiary, the
Southern Ohio Coal Co.
   The commission concluded that Ohio Power from 1982-86 paid its
subsidiary between 25 percent and 33 percent more for coal than the
prevailing market prices.
   FERC ordered the utility to refund $13.4 million to its
wholesale customers for that period.
   But a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here, which has authority
over such actions by federal regulators, overturned the
commission's decision last year.
   The appeals court interpreted the 1935 Federal Power Act to give
the SEC primary authority to regulate sales contracts between
holding companies and their subsidiaries.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Supreme Court today,
said the appeals court was mistaken.
   Scalia said the case now must go back to the appeals court for
further study of the FERC orders.
   In urging high court review of the case, the Justice Department
said effective regulation of utilities serving 49 million
households nationwide could be at stake.
   Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case.
   The Ohio communities that challenged the appeals court ruling -
most tiny villages - are Arcadia, Bloomdale, Carey, Cygnet,
Deshler, Greenwich, Ohio City, Plymouth, Republic, Shiloh,
Sycamore, Wharton, Bryan, St. Clairsville and Wapakoneta.
   The case is Arcadia vs. Ohio Power Co., 89-1283.

<TEXT>
   President Suharto has warned the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries of a possible oil
glut if the Persian Gulf crisis ends, Mines and Energy Minster
Ginanjar Kartasasmita said Tuesday.
   Suharto called on OPEC to reapply the quota system to control
production when the situation has returned to normal in the Gulf,
Kartasasmita told reporters after a meeting with the president.
   ``We hope and everyone hopes that the Gulf crisis will be over
as soon as possible and we must be ready to cope with the
difficulty in putting things in order again as it is not easy to
cut output after enjoying large production,'' Kartasasmita said.
   He said currently, without Iraq and Kuwait, OPEC produces 22.6
million barrels of oil per day exceeding its self imposed quota of
22.5 million barrels per day set last July.
   Iraq and Kuwait produced about 4 million barrels per day before
the Gulf crisis that began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2. The global community immediately boycotted oil from Iraq
and Kuwait, and some OPEC nations began producing more than their
quotas of crude oil to make up for the shortfall.
   Analysts have said producing nations will be reluctant to cut
back on the oil they pump once Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude is put back
in the marketplace, particularly since prices are likely to be
depressed at that point.
   Kartasasmita predicted the production may rise further to reach
23 million barrels per day as demand for OPEC oil will rise from
22.5 million barrels in the third quarter to an estimated 23
million or 23.5 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of
this year.
   Indonesia currently produces about 1.3 million barrels of crude
oil per day and exports about 780,000 barrels.
   Kartasasmita said the country will raise its output to 1.4
million barrels per day next month.

<HEAD>EC Asks Procter &amp; Gamble To Suspend Cooperation Deal With Finaf
SpA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission asked
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of the United States and Italy's Finaf SpA on
Tuesday to suspend a plan to cooperate on making diapers and other
personal hygienic products.
   The companies said in September they plan to create joint
ventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal for their paper products
businesses, notably diapers and sanitary napkins. Also, Procter
said it would buy all of Finaf's activities in Britain.
   The Commission asked the companies to hold off until it is
satisfied ``there is no breach'' of EC fair competition rules.
   A Commission official said the accord could create or strengthen
dominant positions by the two companies and received a complaint
about the planned venture from Peau Douce SA, a French diaper
maker.
   Peau Douce argued Procter's deal with Finaf would violate
competition rules and asked for interim measures to stop the
agreement from taking effect.
   The EC treaty bans undertakings that prevent, restrict or
distort fair copetition in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Finaf
have been in touch with the Commission since before they announced
plans for their linkup.
   David Veitch, a spokesman at Procter &amp; Gamble's European
headquarters here, said, ``It has always been our intention not to
implement this agreement until the competent authorities have been
heard.''
   The EC Commission official said discussions with the two
companies were continuing and if these ``go satisfactorily, we can
resolve the problem without going further to law.''
   Veitch said under the deal with Finaf, the two companies were
``to merge their paper product business'' in Italy, Spain and
Portugal.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Pampers, is a leading diaper
producer. But Veitch said the company ``was a relatively small
player in Europe'' in sanitary napkins and other personal hygiene
paper goods.
   ``The purpose of the agreement (with Finaf) was to accelerate
our entry'' into those products in Europe, he said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
marets adjusted to indications there may be no large U.S. grain
sales to the Soviet Union in the coming year.
   A top Soviet grain-buying official said Monday after meeting
with U.S. Agriculture Department officials that he expects a U.S.
offer of food export credits in six months, but that the Soviets
will have filled their food needs from other sources by then.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell broadly Monday after
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter reaffirmed the Bush
administration's position that any export credits or subsidized
grain sales to the Soviet Unions would be contingent on Soviet
emigration reforms.
   Yeutter said today that the Soviet Union has not formally
requested food aid from the United States.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.43\ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.18 a
bushel; oats were { cent lower across the board with December at
$1.04 a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher
with January at $5.76\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the Agriculture Department on
Monday issued a monthly report that showed unexpectedly large
supplies of frozen pork bellies.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .38 cent lower with December at
79.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .50 cent lower
with January at 87.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent to .50

   Hyundai Motor Co. marked a milestone
Tuesday when its auto exports to the United States surpassed the 1
million mark, the biggest South Korean automaker said.
   The company said it has now exported 1,000,021 cars to the
United States since it entered the market in February 1986.
   The exports to the U.S. account for two-thirds of Hyundi's
global auto exports of 1.5 million cars during the past four years
and 10 months.
   Hyundai entered the American market in 1986 with subcompact Pony
sedans.
   Hyundai's annual auto exports worldwide peaked at 408,000 in
1988 but declined to 209,000 last year with a loss of price
competitiveness and due to sluggish demands in some foreign
markets.
   Hyundai expects its global auto exports to rise to 230,000 cars
this year because of a pickup in sales in Europe, including
East-bloc countries which are emrging as new markets for Korea.

   For Gail Edwards, getting down to business means
roving the central Maine countryside with her four young children
in search of wild herbs and flowers to blend into natural teas and
tonics.
   Annual sales of her home-made potions amounted to a mere $200
last year. But this spring Edwards expects to sell $20,000 worth of
products thanks to a $5,000 loan secured with the help of Women's
World Banking.
   The non-profit group has helped at least 250,000 women worldwide
get started in business over the past decade through counseling or
by securing loans.
   ``It brought my business from essentially a dream into a
thriving business,'' said the 41-year-old Edwards, a single mother
who had little hope of getting a bank loan before Women's World
Banking's Maine affiliate took up her cause.
   Although it pales in size to other global lending institutions,
the New York-based group has had a profound economic - and
political - impact in clearing the way for many businesswomen.
   In Thailand, the group helped 100 women start a dairy
cooperative by helping them get loans totaling $1 million. And the
group's affiliate in India has grown into an active savings and
loan program for about 60,000 women - many of them from the lowly
regarded untouchable caste.
   Thanks to negotiations by the group, the governments of Japan
and Kenya have stricken regulations that required women to have
their loans guaranteed by their husbands or fathers.
   ``In most countries of Latin America and Asia, the cultural
barrier has been broken,'' said group president Nancy Barry.
   Ironically, the United States is the final frontier for the
global organization, she said.
   Focusing on developing countries since its inception 10 years
ago, the group's five U.S. affiliates thus far only have the power
to help women draw up business plans, write loan applications and
suggest alternate funding routes. But before the end of the year,
at least one branch - the Akron, Ohio, affiliate - expects to start
guaranteeing bank loans like its overseas counterparts.
   It's a significant step. Despite notions of the United States as
progressive in women's rights, old ways sometimes die hard in the
nation's predominantly male lending industry.
   ``Credit isn't without bias, which is different than
discrimination,'' said Barbara Lange, executive director of Women's
Entrepreneurial Growth Organization (WEGO), the Akron branch. ``A
part of the lending process has to do with the comfort level of the
banking officer.''
   For example, when physical therapist Claudia Miller set out last
year to get a loan to start her own practice in Akron, the single
woman had no idea her marital status would become a liability. But
the bank's loan officer essentially ignored the financial case
she'd built and instead insisted on checking out the income level
of her part-time partner's husband.
   Miller, 42, decided to seek an alternative method of funding.
Working with WEGO - not yet set up to guarantee loans - Miller
developed a cohesive business plan that led to a creative
alternative. Instead of outright buying the $75,000 high-tech
business equipment her practice required, Miller agreed to lease it
with an option to buy later on.
   Such creativity is repeated throughout the 40 countries in which
Women's World Banking has branches.
   In the case of Edwards, the potion purveyor, Women's World
Banking helped her write a business plan that convinced a local
economic development agency to loan her $5,334. She spent the money
on newspaper advertisements, a 12-page mail-order catalog and
spiffy packaging.
   Her business plan already has shown positive results. Edwards
said she was working 16-hour days to meet the surge in requests for
her wild-gathered potions of comfrey, colts foot and other
medicinal herbs. And this fall, the West Athens, Maine, woman was
able to achieve a nearly 20-fold jump in sales from the previous
year - a windfall since her only other source of income was food
stamps and $80 a month in child support.
   With her new-found income, Edwards, who left Hoboken, N.J., 20
years ago, hopes to turn an outside shed into a new drying area for
her herbs.
   Barry, the Women's World Banking president, said women generally
are good loan risks because they ``tend to be very practical and
have their feet on the ground,'' know how to ``juggle a lot of
balls at a time,'' and are ``balanced with a sense of the
possible.''
   ``All of those skills are precisely what it takes to make a
small business work,'' explained Barry, 41, a former World Bank
employee who pioneered that group's projects in small business
development in 1975.
   Barry, a Harvard MBA graduate, spends her weeks girdling the
globe to make sure things are running smoothly.
   During a recent workday, ten floors above the screeching
congestion of midtown Manhattan, Barry filled her corner office
with smoke from her freshly lit Marlboro - taken from a
10-cigarette pack she pocketed from a airplane from Tokyo the night
earlier. She noted that her November itinerary called for stops in
no less than seven countries.
   ``I actually got to sleep in my own bed last night - it was kind
of exciting,'' she said, as she prepared to leave Malaysia in two
days.

   The Soviet Union and its former allies are likely
to face the hardest winter since World War II as recession,
compounded by rising oil prices, continues to deepen, U.N.
economists said Tuesday.
   The economists drew a grim picture of increasing food shortages
in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania, soaring unemployment
rates throughout the region and double-digit inflation. These
threats could stall the whole reform process of moving from a
command to a market economy.
   ``The consequences of such a failure are incalculable and would
not only be economic,'' they warned in a 147-page report, which
also pointed to ``increasing signs of social unrest in the East.''
   ``One certain effect would be to raise enormous pressures for
emigration from the East to the West,'' said the survey, compiled
by experts of the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe. It noted
that new Soviet legislation would soon allow unrestricted travel
abroad.
   ``There seems to be little ground for contradicting the view
that the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are facing
their hardest winter since the end of the second World War,'' it
said.
   The survey also said slower economic growth in Western Europe
and fears that the United States could slide into recession may
have an impact on financial and technical support for the East.
   Moscow's former Eastern European allies depend on the Soviet
Union for about 80 percent of their oil. Transmission breakdowns
have already reduced Soviet exports by more than a fifth, the
survey noted.
   Starting Jan. 1, 1991, payment for Soviet oil will have to be in
convertible currency and at world market prices. Under the region's
Comecon trading system, to be dissolved on that date, Moscow's
partners have paid the equivalent of about $7.50 per barrel in
transferable rubles. This compared with an average $18 paid on
world markets before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   If Eastern Europe has to buy oil at $35 or even $40 a barrel,
then the ``price shock is much larger'' than the ones faced by the
West in the 1970s, the survey said.
   The Comecon trading system, based on bilateral agreements, has
already effectively collapsed, the survey said.
   ``During the course of this year, a chaotic mixture of barter
deals, clearing agreements and hard-currency transactions have
emerged,'' it added. To avoid accumulation of rubles, the survey
said, Moscow's partners have resorted to avariety of trade
restrictions that led to retaliations and a ``virtual trade war.''

   Federal engineers are stepping up an
investigation of reported seat belt failures in 1984 and 1985 Ford
Mustang automobiles, the government reported today.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had
upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation - an examination
of paperwork - to an engineering analysis, in which engineers will
study the possibly defective parts.
   Agency spokesman Tim Hurd said there had been 21 complaints of
plastic components in the seat belt buckles breaking so the belt
could not be latched. An estimated 273,500 of the vehicles are on
the road.
   The agency also announced it was similarly upgrading its
investigation of reported cracks in the floors of Ward 54 school
buses, manufactured from 1983 to 1990 by the American
Transportation Co. Hurd said such cracks had been reported in 11
fleets totaling 103 buses.
   The agency discontinued an investigation of reported rollover
propensities of Ford Bronco II automobiles manufactured between
1984 and 1989, saying it found no unreasonable risk.

   One giant economy stretching from above the
snowy Arctic Circle to below the sun-baked Yucatan Peninsula -
that's the dream of promoters of a North American trade bloc.
   The United States, Canada and Mexico need to form a common
market to counter emerging free-trade zones in Europe and Asia, say
these boosters, who count President Bush among their numbers.
   Also, supporters say, it only makes sense for the United States
to ease trade restrictions with its southern neighbor and
third-largest trading partner, Mexico, since it did so with its No.
1 partner, Canada, two years ago.
   Following a U.S.-Mexico agreement, a North American free-trade
zone could be created by a companion pact between Canada and
Mexico, an idea already backed by Canadian officials.
   That could mean products made in any one of the three nations
could be freely sold in the other two - creating a vast consumer
market of more than 360 million people.
   Bush endorsed a North American common market in his presidential
campaign two years ago. He was in Mexico on Monday and Tuesday for
talks with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on establishing a
U.S.-Mexico free-trade pact, the next step in creating such a
trading zone.
   Supporters say such an accord would bring a number of benefits
to Americans, including cheaper goods made by U.S. companies in
Mexico, an expanded market for U.S. products in Mexico, and a
counterbalance to the barrier-free Europe planned by the end of
1992, as well as moves by Japan toward forming an Asian trade bloc.
   ``Given the competition of the Asian countries, and Japan
especially, the United States has to have access to cheaper labor
in order to be able to compete internationally,'' said Abel
Beltran-del-Rio, chief economist for Ciemex-Wefa, an economic
consulting firm specializing in Mexico.
   For Mexicans, a pact should boost the nation's troubled economy
by luring U.S. investment in plants and technology. It also should
open up the U.S. market to more Mexican products, particularly
agricultural goods, boosters say.
   For both countries, a pact could ease friction over illegal
Mexican aliens in the United States.
   Supporters say there should be less reason for Mexican laborers
to migrate to the United States if there are more jobs at home. In
addition, Mexican officials want the pact to include provisions
making it easier for Mexicans to enter and work in this country.
   Despite these factors favoring a free-trade pact, don't expect
duty-free tequila anytime soon. Detractors, especially organized
labor, are expected to fiercely fight any agreement that could
result in a weaker bargaining position for U.S. workers and a loss
of U.S. factory jobs.
   ``Who gains from the agreement are U.S. or multinational
companies that can take advantage of very, very low wages,'' along
with minimal environmental and worker-safety rules in Mexico, said
Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO.
   She said an idea of the outcome of a trade pact can be seen by
examining the ``maquiladoras,'' the thriving U.S. assembly plants
located just over the Mexican border. There, Mexican workers toil
for as little as $2.90 a day under conditions resembling sweatshops
of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the union coalition
contends.
   Ms. Johnson said a North American free-trade agreement would be
``a disaster for U.S. workers and ultimately Canadian workers,
because everything's going to be made in Mexico.''
   Mexican officials and other boosters say any loss of U.S. jobs
would be offset by an increase in U.S. exports to its southern
neighbor.
   For each incremental dollar Mexico would receive through the
pact, about 15 cents would end up going to the United States
through the purchase of U.S. goods, said Edgardo Mendoza Valdes, an
official of the Mexican stock brokerage Probursa and a
representative of the Mexican financial sector to the trade talks.
   Under a free-trade agreement, each nation would manufacture what
it does best or cheapest, he said.
   ``There will be losses in some (U.S.) sectors and there will be
gains in other sectors, from exporters,'' said Beltran-del-Rio, the
economist.
   He also predicts U.S. exports to the rest of the world would be
boosted by the use of Mexican labor, bolstering the U.S. economy.
``I don't see why the United States cannot grow like it used to
grow when its cost structure was more competitive in the world.''
   But Mexico has its own critics of a free-trade agreement. Among
their concerns is the sanctity of Mexico's vast oil reserves,
nationalized in 1938 after accusations that U.S. oil companies were
exploiting the nation.
   These critics don't want any free-trade pact to include the
right for U.S. oil companies to gain control of Mexican oil fields.
   Since Salinas took office in December 1988, Mexico has lowered
tariffs and joined the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs,
which his predecessors strongly opposed.
   The United States shipped $24.97 billion worth of goods to
Mexico in 1989 and imported $27.19 billion in Mexican goods, for a
U.S. trade deficit with Mexico of $2.2 billion.

   Share prices ended slightly higher on London's
Stock Exchange Tuesday, but well down from session peaks, as some
institutional investors began to have second thoughts about the
possibility of a cut in British base lending rates.
   The pending vote on the leadership of the Conservative Party and

dealers said. The market closed before Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major's victory was announced.
   Foreign currency trading was affected by the announcement,
however. The pound rose to $1.9790 after the news from $1.9750
before. It had closed at $1.9655 on Monday.

   Pan American World Airways said Tuesday it would
offer cheap winter fares to London in hopes of attracting more
passengers during the slow winter travel season.
   The cash-strapped carrier said passengers who buy tickets by
Dec. 7 can get a one-way fare of $149 from New York to London,
based on a roundtrip purchase, with fares slightly higher from
other cities served by Pan Am.
   Two of Pan Am's competitors on the trans-Atlantic flights, Trans
World and British Airways, had no immediate comment on whether they
intended to slash any fares in response.
   Airlines usually move quickly to match cheap fares offered by
rival carriers for fear they could otherwise lose passengers in the
highly competitive industry.
   The Pan Am fares, which are non-refundable and available on only
a limited number of seats, are good for travel between Jan. 7 and
March 21, but the trips must begin by March 14.
   ``The softening of air traffic demand expected during the first
quarter of 1991 due to weakening economic conditions has prompted
us to offer winter salfe fares to Europe,'' said John Bloodworth, a
Pan Am spokesman. ``We are confident that the fares will stimulate
traffic during the traditionally slow winter travel period.''
   Pan Am is also offering some sale fares to most of its other 33
destinations in Europe.

<TEXT>
   The Cineplex Odeon movie theater chain said
Tuesday it had reached an agreement with its banks that allows the
company to defer principal payments until mid-1992.
   The preliminary four-year agreement also allows the company to
hold on to assets that were to be sold under a previous loan
agreement.
   Cineplex had been committed to selling $160 million (U.S.) in
assets by Sept. 30. The company had raised $120 million (U.S.) by
selling U.S. theater properties.
   The new agreement also combines the company's banks in two
separate syndicates with three outside banks to form a single bank
group.
   Cineplex Odeon is one of the largest theater operators in North
America with 1,700 screens in 415 locations.
   The company has been struggling recently because of a large debt
load amassed in an aggressive expansion by former Chairman Garth
Drabinsky.
   In an effort to turn things around, Cineplex has been peddling
assets not connected to its main cinema business.
   The company has been loaned $100 million (U.S.) by the Claridge
Group, controlled by Montreal financier Charles Bronfman, and the
U.S. entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc., which was bought Monday
by the Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd.
   The new banking deal requires that this debt be converted to
Cineplex stock by May 31, 1991.
   In addition, MCA and Claridge have agreed to provide the company
with a $35 million (U.S.) line of credit.
   The new banking deal should help the company's restructuring
campaign, said Peter Legault, an analyst with the brokerage Thomson
Kernaghan.

   Economists say that if corporate America is to
succeed in the midst of recession and increasing global
competition, workers must become more productive. In the first of a
three-part series examining ``The New Workplace,'' Sharon Cohen
looks at how more and more companies, large and small, are turning
bored workers into effective bosses, and getting dramatic results.

   When Ralph Stayer's workers botched sales
orders, mislabeled products and even smashed a forklift into a
wall, he didn't moan, he didn't groan, he just changed bosses.
   Stayer put his workers in charge. Yes, the same bored people who
made careless, costly errors, he decided, could run his company,
make it more profitable and turn it into a bigger, better business.
   That's precisely what happened at Johnsonville Foods, a family
owned sausage company where workers reign supreme. They hire and
fire each other, buy equipment, write budgets. They are their own
bosses.
   ``Everyone looks at what we're doing and says, `God, that's knd
of flaky, that's kind of goody-goody, warm and fuzzy,''' said
Stayer, Johnsonville's chief executive officer and owner. ``It
isn't a soft or crazy deal. I'm a real hard-nosed pragmatic guy. .
.. Teach people to do for themselves, this way you get a far better
performance.''
   This run-it-yourself philosophy, in place for eight years at
Johnsonville, is spreading across corporate America, from small
companies to Fortune 500 heavy-hitters such as IBM, General Mills
and Goodyear. The rank and file are taking charge like never
before, using brains, not brawn, on the assembly line.
   Nowadays, steel and auto workers, sausage stuffers, cereal
packers, engine makers and others work in teams without bosses, set
profit goals, write schedules, develop products, meet customers,
design assembly lines, even pore over financial records.
   ``It's not a social experiment. It makes good business sense,''
said Pat McNulty, who manages a new worker-run General Mills cereal
plant in Georgia. ``Nobody knows the job as well as those doing it.
If you empower those people to make the decisions, they make good
ones.''
   The payoff: reduced costs, better quality, greater efficiency.
McNulty expects productivity to be 30 percent to 40 percent higher
than traditional plants; Johnsonville sales have increased more
than 20 percent annually since the changes were made, and
productivity has increased 50 percent since 1986.
   ``It's one of those rare situations where everybody wins,'' said
John Zenger, president of a California consulting firm. ``Companies
become more competitive. The employees ... learn more skills. The
more you have a sense of autonomy, the happier a camper you are.''
   ``You feel like you're going to your own business, not like
you're going to do something for somebody else,'' said General
Mills worker Rhonda Lunsford.
   Though some companies started this approach long ago, much of
the growth has occurred in the past few years. A recent survey of
476 Fortune 1,000 companies found 46 percent had some employees in
self-managed work teams, compared with 27 percent three years ago.
   And more than half say they'll use more teams in the future,
said Ed Lawler, a University of Southern California management
professor who conducted the survey.
   The motives: increasing global competition and greater profits.
The success of Japanese businesses, and Japan's much-touted
management style, has helped to spark changes in this country.
   ``Companies don't change because they're nice,'' Lawler said.
``They change because they want to make money. ... If it wasn't for
Japan Inc., I don't think a lot of this would be happening.''
   Though this philosophy won't work everywhere - it's pointless in
factories with simple repetitive tasks - changes are occurring in
paper mills, oil refineries, chemical plants and elsewhere, usually
in non-union settings.
   Consider:
   -At Chaparral Steel in Midlothian, Texas, production workers
have traveled to Japan, Europe and Canada to evaluate and decide
what kind of equipment should be purchased. One lathe operator
found a machine for half the $1.5 million budgeted for it. ``He
knew more about the machine than anyone else,'' said Dennis Beach,
vice president of human resources.
   ``If you're not going to be responsible, you might as well be a
monkey on an assembly line,'' said millwright Mike Glenn.
   -At Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s hose plant in Mount Pleasant,
Iowa, there is no seniority, no time clock, no supervisors - just a
manager and teams, with rotating coordinators.
   ``It's nothing like a factory,'' said worker Danny Pulse.
``You're actually in on everything - from making it to sending it
out the door. It's not th  same old grind every day. You don't get
burned out. You're making your own decisions. You actually get to
use your own judgment.''
   Workers, too, determine if colleagues deserve raises.
``Sometimes the sparks fly,'' said human resources manager Dave
Smith. ``You have to take constructive criticism and not everyone
can.''
   -At General Mills' plant in Covington, Ga., workers, or
``technicians,'' do their own maintenance, scheduling and clerical
jobs, make quality checks, handle disciplinary problems and
participate in interviewing and selecting new employees.
   ``You have to want to take a leadership role,'' said McNulty,
the plant manager. ``That's kind of different from the person who
wants to come in and be told what to do.''
   -At IBM's Rochester, Minn., plant, as in many other places,
workers can shut down production lines. One did this year when she
spotted a defect on a device built into a computer storage product,
saving money and customer inconvenience. Workers there recently won
the coveted Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
   -At the Springfield Remanufacturing Corp., workers in the
Missouri-based privately owned company have access to financial
records, learn how to read income statements and can start spinoff
businesses, sharing profits.
   If it all seems more democratic, Robert Bies, an associate
management professor at Georgetown University, warns, ``The
rhetoric is far ahead of the reality.''
   ``Many of the companies haven't woken up to the call of
competition,'' he added. ``People have to give up authority and
they don't like it.''
   This approach has drawbacks, too, such as reducing promotion
possibilities, eliminating seniority rights and creating new
pressures.
   ``If for the last 10 years, you've been telling people what to
do, then they say, `You're not going to do this anymore,' (You
think) `What am I going to do?''' said Robert Kelley, management
professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of
Industrial Administration.

   At Johnsonville, everything didn't click immediately.
   ``Do you think we had people doing budgets the first day they
walked in? We spent five years at that,'' Stayer said.
   Workers, dubbed ``members,'' also train one another, decide how
much to spend on equipment, cut their hours when necessary and
choose which ``associates'' - those hired during busy seasons -
become full-time employees. There are no supervisors, just coaches.
   Initiative is required. One team designed an assembly line. A
bookkeeper suggested a mail-order business and shares the profits.
   ``They feel like they own it, and therefore act like owners,''
said Linda Honold, a former coach who works with Stayer advising
other companies.
   Things weren't always so smooth, said Lori Lehmann,
Johnsonville's statistics and hiring coordinator, who recalls how
she used to call in sick to avoid work.
   ``There was no direction, no communication with the supervisors.
... You didn't express ideas,'' she said. ``You'd punch in, do your
job, punch out.''
   Stayer knew something was wrong, despite strong sales. In the
November-December issue of the Harvard Business Review, he
describes how workers mislabeled products, sprayed water on them
and made other mistakes.
   ``People didn't care,'' he said. ``They didn't invest much of
themselves in their jobs. I had to change to make them be more
important so their jobs would be more important.''
   This approach, begun in 1982, is flourishing.
   ``I don't get a lot of pressure from above,'' said worker
Michelle Stock. ``I'm not just standing there doing my thing. I'm
paying attention. You're thinking about what's going on. You're
thinking about the results.''
   Johnsonville has no cost-of-living increases or seniority
raises. Members receive more money only if they assume more
responsibility. Bonuses, tied to the company's performance, amount
to 28 percent of pre-tax profits.
   That's what it's all about.
   ``They're far more valuable people,'' Stayer said. ``These
people have skills that they can take anywhere. That's real
morality.''

   The government's 30 percent stake
in the phone company ENTel will be offered to investors early next
year for $400 million to $600 million, a financial analyst said
Tuesday.
   The stock offering will be the biggest in Argentine history,
said Enrique Ruete Aguirre, chief executive officer of the Roberts
Group that advised the government on the ENTel sale.
   Earlier this month, the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
(ENTel) was broken into two regional companies and privatized.
   European and U.S. investors agreed to pay a combined down
payment of $214 million cash and $380 million in notes for 60
percent of ENTel.
   They also agreed to retire $5 billion of Argentine foreign debt
worth about $750 million on secondary markets.
   Of the 30 percent to be sold, 5 percent will be offered first to
Argentina's 200 rural telephone cooperatives.
   The remaining stock - and any of the 5 percent unsold - will go
on sale in Argentina and New York next April or May, Ruete said. It
initially will e offered for over-the-counter trading, Ruete said,
before applying to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Pepsi's Right to Split From Perrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PepsiCo Inc. on Tuesday won a court battle to break
its business relationship with Source Perrier and take direct
control of its soft drink operations in France.
   The Paris commercial court officially recognized that the
franchise bottling relationship between PepsiCo and a unit of
Source Perrier SA will expire at the end of this year.
   The decision clears the way for Pepsi Cola France SA to take
direct control of bottling and distributing Pepsi brand beverages
in France at the beginning of next year.
   Officials at Perrier, the maker of the well-known sparking
mineral water, had no immediate comment. It was not known whether
the court ruling would be appealed.
   PepsiCo announced a year ago that it intended to end its
franchising agreement with Perrier. Stuart Haugen, managing
director of Pepsi Cola France, said Pepsi's market share in France
had fallen over a decade from 18 percent to 9 percent.
   Haugen blamed inadequate distribution efforts by Perrier,
asserting that Pepsi Cola ``clearly wasn't a priority business for
them.'' He said Pepsi Cola accounted for only 1 percent to 2
percent of Perrier's annual revenue.
   Perrier said the steady decline in Pepsi sales was due to
insufficient publicity by the U.S. group and its refusal to launch
Diet Pepsi, a low-calorie cola, on the French market.
   Perrier said Pepsi Cola's announcement that it intended to break
off its contract was timed to coincide with a bid by the U.S.
company to buy Perrier's soft-drink business outright.
   Perrier sold its soft-drink assets to Cadbury-Schweppes PLC of
Britain in March.
   In May 1989, Pepsi Cola's arch rival, Coca-Cola Co., agreed to
buy its French bottler from its parent, Pernod-Ricard SA, ending a
bitter feud between those companies.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding late in the session after
selling that was linked to dimming prospects for Soviet purchases.
   Wheat and corn futures closed slightly lower.
   Market analysts said the late surge in soybean prices appeared
to have been prompted by technical signals because there was no
fresh news to spark a rally.
   The strong finish erased Monday's moderate losses, which had
reflected disappointment in the outlook for new Soviet purchases of
U.S. agricultural products. Statements made Monday and early
Tuesday by U.S. and Soviet officials indicated the Soviet Union may
not be a large buyer of U.S. grain in the coming year.
   Richard Feltes, research director with the commodities brokerage
Refco Inc., said the recent volatility in the soybean market
suggested prices have bottomed out.
   ``This is a wild, choppy time and it's difficult to take a stand
and be committed for very long, but my long-term view is that we're
headed higher,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 3\ cents lower with

<HEAD>More than 40 Jobs Cuts At Two WPP Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advertising agencies owned by WPP Group PLC, the
world's largest ad and marketing services agency group, have
decided to cut more than 40 jobs because of the loss of two major
accounts, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   At the same time, a company source said WPP Chairman Martin
Sorrell has issued an internal company memo pressing department
heads to cut costs when they draw up their budgets next month.
   The memo follows WPP's warning last week that its annual pre-tax
profit wouldn't match analysts forecasts of 110 million pounds, or
$217 million.
   Forty employees are leaving J. Walter Thompson's 490-member
London staff due to the loss of the National Westminster Bank
account, said a WPP spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
   The spokesman also confirmed a published report that another WPP
agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, is cutting jobs in New York because of
the loss of the Volvo car account. He did not say how many jobs
were being cut, but The Wall Street Journal said about 35 people
were being cut from a staff of 260.
   Marvin Sloves, who heads the agency, was said to be involved in
meetings and was unavailable for comment on the report.
   The agency recently resigned the Volvo account amid controversy
over an advertisement that purported to show a Volvo surviving
relatively intact while other cars were crushed by a ``monster''
pickup truck with oversized wheels.
   It turned out that the Volvo was reinforced with steel and wood
while other cars were structurally weakened before the ad was shot.
   WPP has vaulted to the top of the advertising world in terms of
billings in the past five years.
   It bought the parent of the J. Walter Thompson ad agency and the
Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations agency in 1987, and bought the
parent of another venerable agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, two
years later.
   In addition, it has acquired dozens of smaller marketing
services agencies that specialize in areas such as packaging and
design.
   But in the process, the company has accumulated a debt which
totaled 325 million British pounds at the end of 1989.
   As the growth of ad spending has slowed in recent months, some
analysts expect that Sorrell will take aggressive action to cut
costs, possibly including asset sales.

   Gasoline prices rose an average 0.7 cent a gallon in the week
ended Tuesday and could rise more by the weekend if retailers begin
passing a new 5-cent-a-gallon tax to motorists, the American
Automobile Association said.
   The new federal excise tax, part of the the budget package
agreed to by President Bush and Congress last month, takes effect
this Saturday. The tax will raise the current excise levy to 14
cents a gallon from 9 cents.
   AAA's Fuel Gauge Report, a weekly nationwide survey conducted

showed the average price of self-serve regular unleaded gasoline
was $1.366 a gallon, vs. $1.359 a week ago.
   Self-serve unleaded costs 29.1 cents more a gallon than on Aug.
1, the day before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which precipitated a
Persian Gulf military crisis and a rapid increase in the price of
crude oil.
   AAA, based in Orlando, Fla., said fuel costs were up in New
England, the Great Lakes region and the West, but declined slightly
in other regions.

   Stock prices posted modest gains today after a
morning of aimless trading.
   Analysts said there was little direction for traders. Oil prices
dipped briefly in the early afternoon, sending stock prices higher,
but then oil recovered and stocks gave back much of their gain.
   Trading was light but volatile, said Dudley Eppel, a managing
director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``It's all over the place. It's really a minute-to-minute
game,'' he said.
   Eppel said there was no economic news to affect the market, and
``not much conviction either way'' prices went.
   But, he said, there were some pockets of strength among stocks
that have been weak, such as high-technology and utility company
issues. He said he believed the buying interest there stemmed from
a perception that these stocks were cheap.

<HEAD>Major Expected to Pursue Softer but Thatcherite Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Britain's next prime minister, John Major is
expected to pursue kinder, gentler versions of Margaret Thatcher's
free-market policies.
   Major, the nation's top treasury official for the past 13
months, was the financial markets' popular choice. The pound rose
strongly Tuesday on word that he defeated two challengers to become
the new leader of the Conservative Party.
   The pound rose to $1.9790 after the news from $1.9750 before. It
closed at $1.9655 on Monday.
   The stock market, which closed for the day before Major's
victory was announced, was expected to rise when it reopened
Tuesday.
   ``It's as good a result as we could have hoped for. We have a
former chancellor (of the exchequer) leading the country,'' said
Derek Scott, chief economist at the London investment firm Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel and Co., said:
``The financial markets quite rightly see Major as a continuation
of Thatcher.''
   Major is a regarded as a free-marketeer who is expected to
continue the Thatcherite policies of privatization, prudent tax
cuts, and tight fiscal spending. ``I intend to build on the
policies we have,'' he said when he began his campaign last
Thursday.
   Opponents have accused him of being nothing more than Mrs.
Thatcher's ``poodle,'' but supporters insist he is his own man.
Mrs. Thatcher said she was thrilled he won.
   Major is expected to continue current economic policy of high
interest rates to fight 10.9 percent inflation, although he is
expected to cut the 14 percent base lending rate soon.
   The aim would be to maintain the Conservative Party's upward
momentum in the opinion polls, which showed the Tories surging
against the socialist Labor Party during the two-week leadership
struggle.
   Major said Thursday his priorities were uniting the Conservative
party and defeating the Labor party in the next general election,
which must be called by mid-1992.
   David Owen, a British economist at the London investment firm
Kleinwort Benson Ltd., said: ``The next 18 months or so of U.K.
economic policy-making will certainly depend on when they hold the
next election. All the Tories want to do is win the next
election.''
   Major he has pledged to review the highly unpopular per capita
community charge or ``poll tax,'' suggesting it might be linked to
taxpayers' ability to pay.
   ``I have become increasingly convinced that we can't leave
things as they are,'' Major said about the tax. ``In no sense would
I be afraid to make changes in government policy when I think it is
wrong.''
   He also said he would make the biggest tax cuts at the lower end
of the tax brackets. High earners got the biggest breaks under Mrs.
Thatcher.
   He is expected to be slightly more enthusiastic about European
monetary union than the hostile Mrs. Thatcher, but still cautious.
   Major took the pound into Europe's exchange rate mechanism on
Oct. 8, a move Mrs. Thatcher fought for years. He also wants
Britain to be better represented in Europe discussions.
   However, he has said he wouldn't agree to a single currency and
a single European bank being forced on Britain prematurely.
   Major, who has served as chancellor for a little more than a
year, must deal with an economy that its expected to shrink a
quarter to a half percentage point next year after growing 1
percent this year.
   Major might call an election as early as this coming spring to
capitalize on the improved showing in the opinion polls, Owen said.
   ``He'll want to get a clear mandate from the electorate for the
next five years,'' Owen said. ``He was only elected by the
Conservative Party, not the electorate.''

<HEAD>Report: Japan Won't Comply With Computer Chip Pact, But Progress
Made</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will fall short of complying with a U.S.
trade agreement covering computer chips by the time the pact
expires next year, but progress has been made, a trade group said
Tuesday in a report to President Bush.
   ``Overall, the report concludes that the trade agreement has
succeeded in containing instances of dumping, and in moving toward
a more open market for foreign semiconductors in Japan,'' said Wilf
Corrigan, chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association.
   Dumping is the sale of products in foreign markets below
production costs.
   ``However, despite the recent progress that has been made, Japan
will not have fully complied with the terms of the agreement when
it expires next July,'' said Corrigan, who is chairman and chief
executive of chip maker LSI Logic Corp.
   He added in his statement that the trade group believes a new
chip pact is needed ``to ensure that the objectives of the 1986
agreement are achieved.''
   The Semiconductor Industry Association released the statement
with its annual report to Bush on the progress of the chip
agreement.
   In a letter to Bush accompanying the report, SIA president
Andrew Procassini said progress was hurt by the fact that Japan
``did not begin its initiatives in earnest until almost three years
into the agreement.''
   The report discusses two key elements of the 1986 pact:
preventing Japanese chip makers from dumping their semiconductors
on the U.S. market, and creating an open market for semiconductors
in Japan.
   The report says market-access efforts finally are under way and
are making progress. Foreign market share for semiconductors in
Japan increased from 8.5 percent when the agreement was signed to
13.3 percent in this year's second quarter, it said.
   ``U.S. companies are aggressively pursuing opportunities in the
Japanese market,'' the trade group said.
   The safeguards against dumping have encouraged new investment in
the United States in two categories of chips that were most
severely affected by the practice - dynamic random-access memory
chips and erasable programmable read-only memory chips, the SIA
said.

   Baseball owners are doing better than ever,
increasing their operating profits by 75 percent in 1989 to a
record $214.5 million, according to financial figures obtained by
The Associated Press.
   The 26 teams took in a record $1,241,059,000 in 1989, a 23
percent increase from the previous season. Their operating expenses
were $1,026,550,000, a 16 percent increase from 1988.
   That left them with a pre-tax operating profit of $214,509,000,
or an average of $8.3 million per team. The previous record profit
of $121.6 million was set in 1988 on earnings of $1,007,519,000,
baseball's first billion-dollar season.
   The figures were obtained by the AP from two baseball sources on
the condition they not be identified.
   It was the sixth consecutive season baseball teams increased
their operating profits. Because of the accounting practices of the
various teams, financial figures for 1990 will not be available
until next year.
   Chuck O'Connor, the head of management's Player Relations
Committee, said the figures showed that baseball ``on an overall
basis was doing quite well.''
   ``The difficulty with it,'' he said Tuesday, ``is that you have
to get below the aggregate figures to determine the level of health
of the individual parts that make up the game - the 26 clubs.
There, there's a different story. You can't look at the overall
industry profits and say, `Therefore, my team in Pittsburgh is in
great shape' or `My team in Kansas City is in great shape.'''
   O'Connor said that four clubs lost money in 1989 but that the
figure would become nine based on an apportioned share of the
tentative $280 million collusion settlement.
   Baseball has boomed since the mid-1980s. According to figures
released by the commissioner's office in the past, the 26 teams
lost $66.6 million in 1983 on revenues of $521.6 million, then cut
the losses to $41 million in 1984 and $7.1 million in 1985.
   The teams made $11.5 million in 1986, the season after began
shunning free agents. Two arbitrators found the conspiracy
depressed player salaries and the profit soared to $103.3 million
in 1987.
   In the four years following the start of the conspiracy, the
teams made a total operating profit of $450.9 million.
   However, as part of the tentative settlement of the collusion
cases, owners have agreed to give the Major League Baseball Players
Association a payment that would amount to $280 million as of Jan.
2. Interest will be added if the payment is made after that date.
   One source said that approximately 50 percent of the 1989
revenues came from tickets sales, parking and concessions.
Approximately 20 percent came from national radio and television
contracts, 20 percent from local broadcasting contracts and the
remainder from postseason games, advertising and other
baseball-related revenue.
   Approximately 31.5 percent of the operating revenue was spent on
player salaries, the source said.

   The head of the U.S. Small Business
Administration chided Parker Brothers Inc. Tuesday for showing
``insensitivity to modern realities'' in a game that lists
``supermom'' and schoolteacher as key careers for girls.
   ``Parker Brothers is sending the wrong message to young girls,''
said SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter. ``Even Barbie dolls come
with business suits these days.''
   ``Careers for Girls'' is a new board game targeted for girls
ages 8-12. Players select from six ``careers'': super mom,
schoolteacher, rock star, fashion designer, college graduate and
animal doctor.
   Instructions for the game, packaged in a hot pink box, include
``Show us how you slow dance with your main squeeze,'' ``Describe
your dream husband,'' ``Tell us the names of your eight children,''
and ``Burn all your chocolate chip cooies.''
   Engeleiter said the game shows an ``insensitivity to modern
realities in a society where women are making breakthroughs in
almost every profession. ... I'm amazed that as we enter the 1990s,
the game doesn't include such careers as business executives,
government leaders, astronauts, scientists, or moms without the
prefix `super.'''
   ``There are no leadership or policymaking careers on this Parker
Brothers game board. There are no careers requiring physical daring
or strength,'' she added, noting that women now own 30 percent of
all businesses in the United States and that the SBA projects they
will own 36 percent by the turn of the century.
   Company spokesman Patricia McGovern stressed the game is purely
for entertainment and ``is certainly not to communicate that only
certain careers are limited to women.'' The game was designed by a
woman, art was managed by a woman and the product manager was a
woman, she said.
   ``So everyone that was involved with bringing this game to
market is female,'' said McGovern. ``We're really disappointed to
hear the objections.''
   The first to register a complaint with Parker Brothers about the
game was Washington attorney Marna Tucker.
   ``I called them up and was infuriated about it,'' said Tucker.
``I think that right before the holiday season that Parker Brothers
is about to step into something very smelly.''
   Tucker said she and a few women's organizations are writing a
letter demanding that Parker Brothers either withdraw the game from
the market or ``contribute their profits from that to women
education groups.''
   ``They could do a lot of things with the profits that would be
helpful to women, to assist women in breaking down further
barriers,'' said Tucker.
   Actually ``Careers for Girls'' is an update of a 1957 version
that listed as professions big business, prospecting, politics,
going to sea, expedition to the moon, farming, Hollywood and
college. McGovern said the careers were changed in 1971 to include
ecology, space, sports, teaching and arts. Career changes were made
again in 1979.
   The game was discontinued in 1984 ``because it had unfortunately
lost its mass market appeal,'' said McGovern. ``We decided to
reintroduce the game for the 1990s and target it to pre-teen girls
because that is a growing niche in the market. Pre-teen girls have
returned to playing board games.''

   Stock prices posted modest gains Tuesday after a
session in which the market tracked the ups and downs of oil
prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 10.64 to
2,543.81.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
959 up, 571 down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.59 million
shares, up from 131.54 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 181.23 million shares.
   Analysts said there was little news on which traders could act.
Oil prices dipped briefly in the early afternoon, sending the Dow
average higher, but then oil recovered and the Dow gave back most
of its gain before rising in the last hour of trading.
   Trading was light but volatile, said Dudley Eppel, a managing
director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``It's all over the place. It's really a minute-to-minute

   Eppel said there was ``not much conviction either way'' that

   But, he said, there were pockets of strength among stocks that

   The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Tuesday that it
is no longer seeking buyers for two of its investment information
subsidiaries, Datastream International and Interactive Data.
   The company cited current conditions in financial markets
worldwide for pulling the two companies off the sales block.
   They generated a combined $155 million in revenue in 1989 and
had been put up for sale in March as the company decided to shed
some of its non-core businesses.
   Company spokesman Reid Gearhart declined to say whether there
were any bids for the two companies or whether bids were too low.
He said Dun &amp; Bradstreet intended to ``continue to manage'' the
companies at their current levels.
   He noted that in the third quarter, the parent company said
Datastream had generated higher revenue than a year ago while
revenue was down at Interactive Data largely because of the
termination of certain services that had been provided under
previous owners.
   Datastream International, based in London, provides investment
information principally on international securities. Interactive
Data, based in Lexington, Mass., provides securities-related
information to the U.S. investment community.
   The two subsidiaries were among seven that Dun &amp; Bradstreet has
put up for sale this year. It has sold three of them while two
others remain up for sale.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet is a world leader in marketing business
information and related service with worldwide operating revenue of
$4.3 billion in 1989.
   Its companies provide the Nielsen television audience ratings,
Donnelley Directory listings and Moody's Investors Service credit
reports.

   Confidence in the economy has sunk to levels
near the depths of the 1982 recession and consumers are paring
spending plans entering the Christmas shopping season, a survey
released Tuesday said.
   The Conference Board said its survey of consumer confidence in
November found more people expecting higher unemployment and weaker
business conditions in the coming months.
   Fabian Linden, a Conference Board economist, said consumer
confidence has dropped to recession levels, ``and is now only
marginally above the figure recorded during the lowest point of the
1982 economic downturn.''
   The business research organization said its monthly Consumer
Confidence Index continued to decline in November, falling to 61.5
from 62.6 in October.
   The index, which registered 115.1 in November 1989, edged down
as the economy has weakened earlier this year, then tumbled after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. It stood at 101.7 in July and
then plunged to 84.7 in August.
   The survey aso found consumers continued to scale back plans
for major expenditures in November, including cars, appliances and
vacations.
   The Conference Board's survey results supported the predictions
of economists and retail industry analysts who said consumers would
spend less this Christmas because of concerns about the economy and
the Middle East.
   Higher unemployment and higher prices for oil and other energy
sources have left Americans with less money to spend on what are
called discretionary items -clothing, appliances, furniture and
gifts.
   Some retailers reported their holiday seasons began well, but
others found consumers were already cutting back their gift-buying.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said many
shoppers appeared to be looking rather than buying over the
Thanksgiving Day weekend, and many appeared reluctant to commit
themselves to big purchases. Sears said its sales were somewhat
below expectations.
   Even smaller retailers and stores that sell toys and other
merchandise popular this time of the year have been affected.
   Tonja Little, manager of the Huggable Hut, a stuffed-animal shop
in Atlanta, said Tuesday that sales have fallen off sharply
compared to last year at the same time.
   ``People are coming in and looking, but they're not buying,''
she said, adding, ``It has a lot to do with the economy slowing
down.''
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington
D.C., described the Christmas season as ``off to a slow start.''
   She said it was not so much a lack of confidence that has made
consumers hesitant, but ``more a reflection of what's happened in
the economy directly ... jobs have been lost since the summer and
wages have not been keeping up with inflation.''
   Elizabeth Armstrong, a retail industry analyst with Prescott,
Ball &amp; Turben, characterized Christmas sales so far as ``mixed to
somewhat disappointing.'' She said warm weather in many parts of
the country was another factor working against consumer spending.
   The Conference Board survey found that Americans have a dim view
of the future. Of those asked, 34.4 percent said there would be
fewer jobs available in six months, 9.7 percent said there would be
more and 55.9 percent predicted employment would be the same.
   When asked what business conditions would be like in six months,
11.2 percent said they would be better, 29.5 said they would be
worse and 59.3 said they would be the same.
   The consumer confidence survey was conducted by National Family
Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, which questioned 5,000 households
across the country. The Conference Board is a business-supported
research group.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Fall Sharply; Supplies Seen Easing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid signs that supply tightness is easing.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals also fell; oil
futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 2.4 cents to 5.5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in November at $1.123 a pound, the lowest
daily settlement for spot copper since June 27.
   The drop extended a decline from levels near $1.30 a pound just
one month ago.
   Analysts said signs of easing supply tightness in London
prompted Tuesday's early selling interest, which in turn triggered
profit-taking and new selling by large speculative funds.
   Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said an expected squeeze in supplies of copper for
delivery against the soon-to-expire November contract did not
materialize, and also spurred selling.
   Both she and analyst Fred Demler of PaineWebber Inc. noted that
Tuesday's fundamental developments - a slight rise in the stock
market and little change in crude oil prices - were bullish for
copper.
   Nevetheless, Raptopoulos said, ``underlying it all are concerns
about recession even though that did not surface today.''
   Gold and silver futures retreated on the Commodity Exchange in
dull trading that reflected a lack of new developments in the
Persian Gulf standoff.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 90 cents lower with December at $385.80
a troy ounce; silver was 4.9 cents to 5.2 cents lower with December
at $4.102 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures were little changed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as diplomats debated the timing of a United Nations
deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 25 cents higher
with January at $32.86 a barrel; heating oil was .89 cent lower to
.45 cent higher with December at 91.49 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .99 cent higher with December at 84.72
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade,
rebounding late in the session after selling interest faded with
dimming prospects for Soviet purchases. Wheat and corn futures
closed slightly lower.
   The strong finish in soybeans erased Monday's moderate losses,
which had reflected disappointment in the outlook for new Soviet
purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Statements made Monday and
early Tuesday by U.S. and Soviet officials indicated the Soviet
Union may not be a large buyer of U.S. grain in the coming year.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2} cents lower with December
at $2.42\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2\ cents lower with December
at $2.18\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2} cents higher with
December at $1.07\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 5} cents
higher with January at $5.82\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures fell moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting slow retail beef sales, end-of-the-month
book-squaring, and selling ahead of first notice day Wednesday for
the December live cattle contract. First notice day is the first
opportunity for traders to declare their intention to deliver a
physical commodity against a futures contract.
   Pork futures ended mostly higher, supported by
lighter-than-expected cash hog sales that may have been due to
winter storm conditions in major hog-producing states.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .65 cent lower with December at
79.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .77 cent lower
with January at 87.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower
to .48 cent higher with December at 52.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .28 cent to .75 cent higher with February at
70.15 cents a pound.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for second period of November 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 17 selling days this year and 17
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 274 selling days
this year and 273 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant
cars.
   Mazda has begun selling sport-utility vehicles made in a Ford
plant in Kentucky.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls As Pound Dominates Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies Tuesday as the British pound, boosted by the election of
John Major as the country's next prime minister, dominated the
foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices slipped lower.
   The pound surged higher after Major, chancellor of the Exchequer
- the British equivalent of the U.S. Treasury - was assured of
becoming the next British prime minster.
   Major, who had the support of outgoing Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, fell just short of winning election as head of the
Conservative Party Tuesday. But his challengers withdrew from the
race and conceded defeat to Major, effectively giving him the prime
minister's job.
   The pound rose to $1.9775 in New York from $1.96895 late Monday.
In London trading before Major's election was assured, the pound
rose to $1.9750 from $1.9655 late Monday.
   Foreign exchange traders had hoped Major would win because they
were familiar with his policies and expected little change if he
succeeded Mrs. Thatcher.
   Mike Faust, a currency market annalyst with Money Market
Services in Chicago, said sterling's fortune might be short-lived.
He said there was speculation among traders that the British
government would lower base lending rates to 13.5 percent from
their current 14 percent.
   Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in
British rates would make that country's investments less attractive
and could send the pound lower.
   Faust said the dollar fell against other currencies amid the
belief that the big industrial nations are satisfied with the
dollar's low levels.
   In overseas trading, the dollar was hurt by a widening of the
U.S. trade deficit. The Commerce Department said the deficit
swelled to $29.75 billion in the July-September quarter, up 28.9
percent from $23.10 billion in the April-June period.
   Traders believe the U.S. government will be more inclined to
keep the dollar lower as a means of narrowing the trade gap. A
lower dollar makes imports into the U.S. more expensive, and this
country's exports cheaper for overseas buyers.
   The dollar fell to 128.35 yen in New York from 129.05 yen late
Monday. In Tokyo earlier, the dollar rose to 128.95 yen from 127.95
yen at Monday's close, and in London, the U.S. currency fell to
128.30 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.48025 German marks, down from 1.4860; 1.2595
Swiss francs, down from 1.2620; 4.9950 French francs, down from
5.0130; 1,111.25 Italian lire, down from 1,116.125; and 1.16405
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16075.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Monday included: 1.4800 German marks, down from 1.4920; 1.2600
Swiss francs, down from 1.2680; 4.9935 French francs, down from
5.0300; 1.6695 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6823; 1,109.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,118.75, and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1596.
   Gold edged down 90 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $385.20 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York
later quoted a bid of $385.00, down $1.15.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid of $384.75 a troy
ounce, from $387.00 late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing
$384.00 an ounce, from $386.50 late Monday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.16 an ounce to $385.19.
   Silver slipped 4.9 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at
$4.100 a troy ounce. Silver fell earlier in London to a late bid of
$4.12 a troy ounce from $4.18 late Monday.

<HEAD>Litton Industry Earnings Drop, Sales Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Litton Industries' first-quarter
profit dropped 9 percent, due in part to slipping advanced
electronics sales, but per-share earnings rose as the firm
continued a stock buyback program.
   Overall sales posted a slight gain to $1.23 billion, from $1.22
billion in the 1990 period, paced by bigger sales in the
shipbuilding segment, the company said Tuesday.
   Earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 were $39.6 million,
compared with $43.6 million in the first quarter of 1990. Earnings
per share were $1.76, up from $1.73.
   ``During the first quarter we repurchased an additional 1.4
million Litton common shares,'' said Orion L. Hock, chairman and
chief executive. ``This continuation of our stock buyback program
offset the earnings decline and resulted in a net gain for our
earnings per share.''
   Litton provides advanced electronic and defense systems,
resource exploration services and industrial automation systems in
the United States and abroad.

   Oil prices were down slightly in uncertain
trading Tuesday, as traders awaited action later this week on a
United Nations resolution authorizing a military strike against
Iraq.
   ``Clearly the traders yesterday and today are betting that there
will be a war and there's some probability of that now,'' said
Philip Dodge, oil analyst at Nomura Research Institute.
   Light sweet crude oil settled down 9 cents a barrel at $32.86
for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract had been off as much as 60 cents earlier in the day,
partly in response to reports that U.N. diplomats would make Jan.
15 - instead of Jan. 1 - the deadline for Iraqi troop withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   The later deadline would push back the likelihood of war. The
U.N. measure, which would authorize ``all necessary means'' to get
Iraq out of Kuwait after that deadline, is to be voted on Thursday.
   Prices had been unchanged at midday when an annual fire drill
closed the trading floor for one half hour. The session turned
bearish when it reopened.
   Buyers' enthusiasm also was dampened by news that Indonesia's
president Suharto warned the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries of a possible oil glut if the Persian Gulf crisis ends.
   ``We have a very narrow trading range even with all the news,''
said Brian Tagler, a broker at Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Contracts for delivery of crude in later months all closed
higher.
   Home heating oil settled .89 cents lower at 91.49 cents a gallon
for December delivery contracts. Contracts for later months were
mixed, mainly due to seasonal factors.
   Unleaded gasoline settled up .52 cents at 84.72 cents per gallon
on December deliver contracts, with other delivery months mixed.
   Natural gas futures were off for the day, with January delivery
contracts falling 7.8 cents to $2.54 per 1,000 cubic feet. February
contracts dropped 4.7 cents to $2.423 per 1,000 cubic feet, with
all later delivery months down as well.
   After the market closed, the leading oil industry group released
weekly figures showing that the nation's supply of crude oil
remained below 1989 levels.
   The U.S. stockpile of crude dropped to 337.1 million barrels
last week, compared with 341.2 million barrels a week earlier and
344.0 million barrels a year earlier, the American Petroleum
Institute reported.
   The stockpile of distillates, which include home heating oil,
were slightly higher at 134.8 million barrels compared with 134.5
million barrels a week earlier but well above 119.6 million barrels
a year earlier. The gasoline stockpile was up slightly to 218.3
million barrels from 217.3 million barrels a week earlier, but
remained below year-ago inventories of 222.1 million barrels.
   The nation's refineries ran at 83 percent of capacity, compared
with 83.2 percent a week earlier and 86.1 percent a year ago.

<HEAD>Administrative Law Judge Rules Against Utility Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge recommended
rejection Tuesday of the proposed $2.5 billion merger between San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, saying the
deal would create a monopoly.
   Officials of both companies immediately said they would
challenge the recommendation by George P. Lewnes, an administrative
judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   ``The sole conceivable beneficiaries in the long term will be
(Edison) and its shareholders,'' Lewnes wrote. ``Meanwhile the
market loses an efficient and vigorous competitor, SDG&amp;E, while the
surviving corporation gains greater market power and acquires all
of the monopolistic anticompetitive advantages attendant thereto.''
   The utilities have 30 days to file briefs to the five-member
FERC responding to Lewnes' ruling. The commission's decision won't
come until next year.
   ``We're not surprised with the decision and will appeal to the
full commission to reverse this result,'' Lee Haney, SDG&amp;E's chief
financial officer, said in a statement. ``We believe that the
record supports the nearly $1.7 billion in merger benefits an that
the antitrust conditions agreed to with the Department of Justice
resolve any competitive concerns.''
   Administrative law judges for the state Public Utilities
Commission have yet to file their recommendations on the proposed
merger. The merger must receive approval by both the FERC and the
state PUC.
   The proposed merger was approved by the boards of directors of
both companies in November 1988 and by the companies' stockholders
in April 1989.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves $135 Million for Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday granted
Eastern Airlines a lifesaving $135 million infusion to keep it
flying through winter and avoid repeated requests for money that
have sapped public confidence in the carrier.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland said he approved the
emergency request in part because of government statements that
chaos could occur if Eastern closes down during the holiday season.
   Eastern said it sought the money because bad publicity had
worsened its financial outlook, spooked potential passengers and
made credit-card companies nervous about doing business with the
carrier.
   The emergency cash request from Eastern was far more than it had
anticipated asking for only a few weeks ago when the judge
permitted the ailing airline to withdraw an immediate $15 million
from an escrow fund. At the time, the judge said Eastern could get
another $15 million if it met certain cash projections as of Dec.
3.
   In the latest grant, Lifland went ahead and gave Eastern the $15
million, plus $120 million more. The judge placed $15 million in a
contingency fund to be used if creditors demand the airline put up
cash deposits before customers do business with it.
   The money is intended to keep Eastern alive through March,
avoiding the need for repeated requests for additional money.
   ``Under all these circumstances, it seems inappropriate to
constantly come back at these short intervals where the adverse
publicity will be repeated again and again,'' Lifland said.
   The judge also chastised the unsecured creditors' committee for
creating tension in Eastern's business through comments to the
media that their goal is to close and liquidate the carrier. He
said the committees had a fiduciary duty to Eastern.
   Eastern's court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr.,
praised the judge for giving Eastern ``a vote of confidence.''
   The latest Eastern request for cash fanned the anger of
unsecured creditors who have been demanding that the court close
down the airline, which has been in financial distress since a
crippling strike in March 1989.
   ``A liquidation of Eastern is inevitable,'' creditor attorney
Joel B. Zweibel said in a court filing opposing the cash infusion.
``It should begin now before further funds are wasted and while
Christmas holiday travelers have several weeks to rearrange their
plans.''
   After the judge approved the request, Zweibel said creditors
would meet to determine their next move.
   Shugrue said the airline needed to know that it would have
access to a much larger supply of cash so it could make long-term
plans.
   ``We simply cannot run the business on a rolling 15-day time
frame,'' he testified at the hearing in Manhattan's federal
bankruptcy court.
   Shugrue said bad publicity from Eastern's previous requests for
money caused passengers to shy away from the airline. Moreover, he
said, credit card companies were starting to demand that the
airline provide millions of dollars up front for charged tickets in
case Eastern goes out of business.
   The unsecured creditors, who are owed about $1 billion by the
airline, say Eastern has virtually no chance of becoming a viable
airline amid industrywide troubles brought on by higher fuel costs
and sluggish demand for air travel.
   Shugrue has said Eastern stands a good chance of reaching the
break-even point early next year through a marketing strategy that
offers first-class seats at coach-class prices.
   But he told the judge Tuesday that Eastern not only needed the
$15 million Lifland had agreed to release in early December, but
another $120 million to keep Eastern operating through the first
quarter of 1991.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceramsak said seeking money from the
court a little at a time would lead to relentlessly bad publicity
hinting that the airline was almost dead, which could become a
self-fulfilling prophesy if travelers decide to fly with the
competition. So Eastern decided to take a stab at getting operating
funds through March at once, Ceremsak said.
   ``We think it's necessary to restore consumer confidence and
build advance bookings,'' she said. ``We sustained significant
damage as a result of the liquidation talk.''
   At the hearing earlier this month, Shugrue had told the judge
that Eastern would need a total of $80 million in a series of
payments from the escrow fund through early January. After that,
Eastern did not believe it would need to tap any more cash from the
fund, and instead hoped to quickly repay the money, he said.
   But Eastern officials said Tuesday that talk of Eastern's
possible liquidation cost it unforeseen cancellations and other
problems that could cost $70 million.
   Miami-based Eastern, one of the industry's oldest and most
troubled airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
reorganization March 9, 1989, after unions crippled the airline
with a strike.
   The airline is now smaller than its pre-strike size, staffed
with strike replacements and some unionists who returned to work.
But the Machinists union remains on strike.
   Shugrue was appointed trustee last April after creditors lost
faith in Eastern's management.

   The big television networks are using the latest
foreign buyout of a Hollywood studio to bolster their effort to
trash federal rules they say leave them at a disadvantage in the
global entertainment market.
   CBS, ABC and NBC each cited Monday's announcement that Japan's
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. had agreed to buy the American
entertainment giant MCA Inc. in a $6.6 billion deal as evidence
that foreign-owned companies have a head start on them in
marshaling resources for quality programs.
   The deal comes only three weeks before the Federal
Communications Commission's Dec. 14 hearing on the financial
interest and syndication rules.
   The 20-year-old ``fin-syn'' rules prohibit the three major TV
networks from having financial interests in shows they don't own
and from getting into the lucrative business of selling network
programs in the $3 billion syndication market for reruns on local
TV stations, cable networks and foreign markets.
   The rules have effectively barred the networks from bidding for
production companies even as foreign companies have swooped in to
buy four of the seven biggest U.S. studios, including three in the
past 14 months.
   Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive at CBS Inc.,
said the MCA deal ``accelerates the dizzying pace of consolidation
in Hollywood.''
   ``This has happened under the financial interest rules that give
foreign-owned studios competitive advantages over the three
American networks. There is no more eloquent testimony for repeal
of these rules than these transactions and the consolidation they
have fostered,'' he said.
   Sony Corp. of Japan bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
in September 1989 and Italian-controlled Pathe Communications Corp.
recently completed a buyout of MGM-UA Communications Inc. Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., based in Australia, has owned 20th Century
Fox Corp. since 1985.
   There was some indication that policymakers in Washington are
hearing the networks' complaints.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the deal ``will almost certainly
affect the debate'' and added the commission must consider ``the
trend toward vertical integration in the entertainment business ...
in concluding what restraints the networks should face, if any, in
their efforts to integrate.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee which oversees the FCC and telecommunications
policy, said the MCA deal ``is an event of considerable
significance'' and said his committee would be interested to see
what comes of the FCC examination of the fin-syn rules.
   Entertainment is one of the few areas in which the U.S. enjoys a
trade surplus, the congressman said.
   ``Our regulatory system should not protect foreign-owned
companies at the expense of American enterprise,'' he said.
   Hollywood studios and producers support the rules because they
fear that the networks as ``gatekeepers of the airwaves'' would
have too much power if they could also have a stake in programs.
   ``The three major national networks say whether a show goes on
the air or not,'' said Jerry Leider, chairman of the caucus of
independent writers, producers and directors. ``It doesn't make a
difference whether MCA is owned by a foreign interests or not.''
   He said without the fin-syn rules, the networks would soon
dominate the production business by demanding concessions on
syndication sales from producers trying to get a show on the
network.
   But the networks argue their power over programming has been
diluted by the proliferation of alternatives such as independent TV
stations and cable TV.
   Richard Cotton, general counsel for the National Broadcasting
Co., said the MCA deal leaves only three major U.S.-owned Hollywood
studio companies - Paramount Communications Inc., Walt Disney Co.
and Time Warner Inc.
   ``The great irony in this development is that U.S. regulatory
policy is actually contributing to the demise of U.S.
competitiveness in the global entertainment sector,'' Cotton said.
   At Capital Cities-ABC Inc., spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the
deal showed the ``anachronism of rules that prevent the three
domestic network companies from competing effectively in the global
and domestic environment.''
   Leider, who was co-chairman of the committee representing the
studios and producers in unsuccessful talks with the networks last
summer over changes in the fin-syn rules, said he expects the rules
will be modified.
   ``We have an an enlightened FCC that sees the wisdom of
safeguards,'' he said. ``I don't think Chairman Sikes has indicated
in that statement that the rules will be repealed.''

<HEAD>Chevron Announces Start-Up Of Point Arguello Offshore Oil Project</HEAD>

   The $2.2 billion Point Arguello offshore
oil facility, which has been dormant since its completion two years
ago, will begin pumping crude within a few months, Chevron Corp.
announced Tuesday.
   The San Francisco-based company, the largest of 18 partners in
the project, also said it would build a new multi-million dollar
underground pipeline to ship oil to refineries in the Los Angeles
area. Completion of that project would take at least three, Chevron
spokesman Mike Libbey said.
   The Point Arguello project is about 10 miles off Point
Conception, which is about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The consortium wants to ship heavy crude via double-hulled
vessels to refineries in the Los Angeles area. However, Santa
Barbara County officials on Nov. 12 rejected a proposal by the U.S.
Department of Energy to use tankers for interim hauling of 40,000
barrels daily while a pipeline was being built.
   The consortium then decided to begin producing 20,000 barrels
per day and send it to Northern California via the All-American
Pipeline, which needs a five-mile connection to a Unocal refinery
near Santa Maria, Libbey said.
   Unocal would use about 10,000 to 15,000 barrels per day, and the
remainder will be shipped to refineries in the Bakersfield area or
in Contra Costa County near San Francisco, he said.
   ``The ultimate preferred destination is Los Angeles because
that's where the need is ... it's the biggest gasoline market in
the world,'' Libbey said.
   He also said the company preferred to transport the high-sulfer,
or sour, crude via pipeline, not tanker, but that the consortium
would still push for using ships while the Los Angeles pipeline was
being built.
   An appeal of the Santa Barbara County decision was filed Tuesday
with the California Coastal Commission, he said, and a hearing is
expected within a few months.
   Point Arguello is permitted to produce up to 100,000 barrels of
heavy crude per day.
   The project was built in the early 1980s on the assumption that
oil prices would be between $40 and $80 per barrel. Earlier this
year, when oil prices dropped below $20 per barrel, Chevron
officials said the partners would have lost money on every barrel
produced, and the company took a $445 million write-down against
its fourth-quarter 1989 profits.
   However, Chevron officials said that bringing in any amount of
cash from the Point Arguello project would help defray its costs.
