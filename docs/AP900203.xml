   Chess champion Antoly Karpov proved that
man can still outwit machine when he beat supercomputer Deep
Thought late Friday in a hard-fought match that went down to the
wire.
   With only 90 seconds left to Deep Thought's 12 minutes, Karpov
forced the computer to resign in the face of inevitable defeat.
   Karpov, the world's No. 2-ranked chess player, made a decisive
penetration into Deep Thought's territory with his king after the
computer, which can calculate 800,000 moves in a second, made a
strategic error.
   The match, which lasted nearly two hours, was held in Harvard's
Memorial Hall. One member of Deep Thought's crew, Sen-Hsiung Hsu,
moved the pieces based on the computer's commands.
   Chris Chabris, alumni adviser to the Harvard Chess Club, said
Karpov was ``was very relieved'' to have finished the game with his
world-class reputation intact.
   ``He knew he was in a lot of trouble,'' Chabris said. Karpov
left immediately after the match instead of speaking as scheduled.
   ``Everyone was very impressed with the way Deep Thought was
performing today. We look forward to watching Deep Thought's
progress in the future,'' said the Harvard Chess Club's president,
Danny Edelman.
   Just before the match, Karpov was given the key to the city and
warmly welcomed by Edelman, who said Deep Thought was ready for
revenge after being beaten by World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in
October of 1989.
   However, by sacrificing a pawn, Karpov was able to isolate Deep
Thought's pawns in a move Edelman termed ``brilliant.'' After the
pawns were isolated, it was an easy win for Karpov, Chabris said.

   After more than 27 years, Makaziwe
Mandela-Amuah is happy to be getting her father back.
   But the 35-year-old daughter of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela says the release doesn't mean the struggle
has ended in South Africa.
   ``Apartheid is not over today,'' she said after South African
President F.W. de Klerk announced Friday in a speech to Parliament
that Mandela would be released unconditionally, although he set no
date.
   The historic changes ``will be meaningless until apartheid is
totally destroyed, until the conditions of the people in South
Africa improve ... and all the illegal laws that have declared us
inferior non-citizens in the land of our birth are totally
dismantled,'' said Mandela, who is known as Maki.
   At a news conference at the University of Massachusetts, where
she is a Fulbright Scholar studying anthropology, Maki Mandela said
she got up at 3 a.m. to watch the broadcast live on cable
television.
   ``Even if it didn't happen today, the thought that I will have a
father back, that he will be a free man again, is very, very good
news to me,'' she said.
   In his address to Parliament, de Klerk also legalized the ANC
after 30 years of guerrilla war against white rule and said he
would lift bans on more than 30 other opposition groups.
   The announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new
constitution that would end the black majority's exclusion from
national politics.
   Maki Mandela said the reforms announced were a landmark, but the
news she found most exciting was the promise of her father's
pending release.
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 on charges he helped
plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign.
   ``I think for many people in the international community my
father is a symbol of the liberation struggle,'' she said.
   ``I think that he's a source of encouragement to many people in
the world and they are amazed that a man who has been in prison for
more than 27 years can still be so dedicated to fight and bring an
evil system down to its knees.''
   Maki Mandela, the youngest of three children from Mandela's
first marriage, said she has no immediate plans to fly back to
South Africa because she must finish her studies. She last saw her
father during a visit over the summer.

   Duff and Bernadette Jacobson have been
married just over a week, and it's been anything but wedded bliss.
   Shortly after their Jan 26 wedding, the Palisades couple was
involved in a traffic accident. Their only car was totaled; they
escaped injury.
   On Thursday night, the couple's rented house caught on fire. The
Jacobsons were not home at the time.
   Duff Jacobson, 25, said he was able to retrieve some of their

   Mrs. Jacobson, 19, said she has been shaken by the disasters,
but the two agreed that their life together is bound to improve.
   ``It couldn't get any worse,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A jury was selected in the trial of
former Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood, clearing the way for
opening arguments next week.
   Twelve jurors were picked Friday after the screening of 52
candidates by attorneys and Anchorage Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone.
   Jurors who will hear the case stemming from the nation's worst
oil spill are an air-traffic control trainee, an engineer, a real
estate agent, the vice president of an insurance firm, a cook, a
job seeker with a background in criminal justice, the chief
operating officer of a corporation, a homemaker, the hardware
manager of a tool-rental store, a grocer, a child-care worker and a
mail carrier.
   Opening arguments may start as early as Monday in Hazelwood's
trial on a felony charge of criminal mischief and on misdemeanor
charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
   The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years,
three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The 987-foot Exxon Valdez that Hazelwood commanded spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil after ramming a
charted reef.
   Selection of the jury was completed after Johnstone granted each
side in the case additional opportunities to rule out prospective
jurors.
   He gave two more peremptory challenges to Hazelwood's attorneys
and one to the state prosecutor.
   Peremptory challenges allow lawyers to remove a prospective
juror without having to give a reason. Otherwise, they only can ask
that a juror be removed for some cause, such as expressed bias.
   The trial for Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is expected to
last at least six weeks.

<HEAD>Veterans' Groups Angered by Flag Ban at Funerals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUINCY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church's decision to ban
the traditional draping of an American flag on the coffins of war
veterans or police officers has drawn fire from veterans' groups.
   ``There are a lot of people who feel strongly that either Dad or
Uncle Charley or whoever received these war medals, and should have
the right to a flag if they want it,'' said Hank Bradley, commander
of the American Legion's Norfolk County district.
   A Vatican-approved revision of the funeral liturgy took effect
Dec. 3. It specifically spelled out a ban on secular symbols, which
had been stated less clearly in an earlier liturgy.
   ``We believe the Eucharist, or the Mass, is so central to faith,
that only Christian symbols can be used,'' said Msgr. Dennis
Sheehan, director of the Boston Archdiocesan Office for Family
Worship.
   The casket may be draped with a flag during the wake, but it
must be replaced with a white cloth before the funeral. The flag
may be returned to the casket after the service.
   John Walsh, a spokesman for Cardinal Bernard Law, said some
veterans' groups had already contacted the archdiocese to object.
   ``Some will apparently misunderstand this as a denigration of
patriotism, he said. ``It is no such thing. I don't want to make
light of what the veterans are feeling. But they should try to look
at the intent of this particular norm.''
   But veterans' groups disagree.
   ``It's terrible. If someone served in the war and they're a
veteran like my husband, I think they should have the right to have
the flag draped over them,'' said Anne Torrance, a member of the
American Legion Auxiliary.

<HEAD>Costly Aircraft Bomb-Sniffing Devices Not Good Enough, Panelists
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a presidential commission say a
costly new device to detect explosives at airports is flawed and
probably could not have found the terrorist bomb which destroyed
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Members of the Presidential Commission on Aviation Security and
Terrorism complained Friday that the giant and heavy bomb detectors
being deployed at major U.S. and foreign airports have not been
adequately tested.
   Several members said at a hearing the devices should not be
installed at hundreds of airports until their reliability can be
guaranteed.
   But Monte Belger, associate administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration, said the sophisticated detection device is
the best of its kind, has gone through enough tests and should be
set up soon to make airports more secure.
   ``It is not perfect and we know it ...,'' Belger said. ``It
would be a mistake not to continue to deploy it. It is wrong to
wait for the perfect machine.''
   At an all-day hearing, the commission also was told the device _
which uses a technique called thermal neutron analysis, or TNA _
will cost far more than original estimates of between $700,000 to
$1 million each.
   Belger said the first five TNA machines actually will cost a
total of $15 million, or about $3 million each, because of the rush
order.
   A TNA system _ employing an 18-foot high, ten-ton detector _ is
inspecting baggage at Kennedy International Airport in New York. A
second system was installed at Miami International Airport last
week and is being calibrated. A third TNA machine is to be
installed at Gatwick Airport near London next month, and another is
being planned for Washington Dulles International Airport.
   ``I think there is a lot of flim-flam going on,'' said Sen.
Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a commission member, saying the TNA has
``incredible deficiencies.''
   ``The TNA looks good but it does not do what it is supposed to
do,'' D'Amato said. ``Congress has been sold a bill of goods. ...
There is a reduced ability to detect plastic explosives at the
levels believed to have been used at Lockerbie.''
   Investigators believe the Lockerbie crash on Dec. 21, 1988, was
caused by less than a pound of plastic explosives inside a portable
tape player. The crash killed 259 people aboard the Boeing 747
aircraft and 11 people on the ground.
   Hadi Bozorgmanesh, vice president of Science Applications
International Corp., defended the TNA device his company developed,
saying the accusation that the machine cannot detect bombs as small
as two pounds is ``absolutely false.''
   He said the machine has a 94 percent reliability rate and ``we
would like to get closer to 100 percent and to detect smaller
amounts of explosives with better accuracy.''
   ``I totally agree that the system is not perfect, but it's far
better than anything else that can be demonstrated,'' he said.
   D'Amato said setting the device to detect a Lockerbie-sized bomb
would set off so many false alarms ``you would have a system which
is inoperative.''
   Science magazine, which first reported in August that the TNA
machines would not be able to detect a Lockerbie-sized bomb, said
the devices are being set at a sensitivity to detect about 2{
pounds of explosives.
   The TNA machines probe luggage for the presence of nitrogen, a
major component of explosives. A problem with the TNA system is
that some types of fabric, leather and such things as plastic ski
boots can have nitrogen densities as high as explosives.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Declares `Scourge Is Beginning to Pass'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug ``scourge is beginning to pass'' and
the government is well on its way to winning the war against
narcotics, national drug policy director William J. Bennett says.
   ``The war is by no means over, but it is clearly winnable and
the momentum, I think, is shifting our way,'' Bennett told the
Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday.
   He said there ``is still too much bad news'' but there are also
``scattered but clear signs that we are beginning to win, the
scourge is beginning to pass. If we keep up our efforts, indeed,
intensify our efforts, we are going to win.''
   Bennett said when he became head of the effort a year ago, ``it
was by no means certain that we would win it.'' But he said, ``My
view has changed.''
   His remarks did not stray beyond what the Bush administration
unveiled last week in the second installment of its anti-drug
strategy, calling for a $10.6 billion budget in the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1.
   Senators of both parties did not bicker over details of the
administration's plan.
   But Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., did ask Bennett to comment on
an alternative strategy Biden wrote. It calls for putting more
stress on hard-core users, education, treatment and a one-time
program to forgive international debt owed by Andean nations if
farmers plant other crops in place of the coca they normally
produce.
   Bennett agreed with most Biden proposals and said differences
were largely a matter of emphasis. But he said that if forced to
choose between education and enforcement, he would strengthen
enforcement.
   The former secretary of education said his background is ``a
helpful auxiliary.''
   ``I know children,'' Bennett said. ``That may not be a very rosy
view of children, but I do know children.''
   ``It seems to me that it's more than a helpful auxiliary,'' Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., said. ``You talk to LeRoy Martin, the
superintendent of police in Chicago, and he'll tell you that
education should be the centerpiece.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., pressed Bennett on why the
administration did not bar the import of semiautomatic assault
pistols which are often only slightly different from the
semiautomatic assault rifles the government does not allow to be
imported.
   The question sparked an exchange similar to fiery arguments over
firearms that have arisen at past Judiciary Committee hearings
between Bennett and Sens. Kennedy and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   ``Why are you silent? Why are you quiet?'' Kennedy demanded.
   ``Because I have given my advice to the president, Senator, and
that is where it should lie,'' Bennett said.
   Kennedy pressed ahead, reminding Bennett at one point that
police are in danger of being targets of assault pistols. Bennett
said the issue was highly complex and criminals would always be
able to get guns while other people had good reason to possess
weapons.
   ``The world is awash in guns, Senator,'' Bennett said. ``This is
a cheap, symbolic victory that you are interested in that has
nothing to do with reality.''

   President Bush says U.S. sanctions against
South Africa should be reviewed in light of President F.W. de
Klerk's reform announcements, but he wants to see more specifics
before scaling back the sanctions.
   ``I'm sure that we'll have a lot of debate and discussion inside
the administration as to what the next move by the United States
ought to be,'' Bush told reporters. ``I am one who has not favored
additional sanctions, so I'm perfectly willing to review things as
new developments take place.''
   Bush said he would look particularly for the freeing of
imprisoned African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``I think when people move in the right direction, it's
certainly timely to review all policy. But we haven't gotten into
any specifics on that at this point. We want to see the policy
initiatives go forward and the release of Mandela,'' he said.
   De Klerk announced Friday that he would free Mandela, a
political prisoner for 27 years, and lift the ban on Mandela's
outlawed African National Congress and other political opposition
organizations.
   De Klerk announced a series of other reform measures, but they
stopped short of what the United States would require to lift the
sanctions, said U.S. officials.
   Under U.S. law, the president can suspend or modify the
sanctions if Mandela and other political prisoners are freed and
other specific conditions are met.
   ``All are essential in ending apartheid and restoring justice,''
said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   Some members of Congress urged Bush to keep the sanctions in
place, noting South Africa's system of racial apartheid is still
intact.
   ``The sanctions should be maintained in full force. This is no
time to relax them,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``Apartheid is crumbling as the Berlin Wall crumbled only a few
months ago,'' Kennedy said, adding the sanctions had helped
pressure South Africa into changes.
   The economic sanctions include a ban on U.S. imports of
textiles, coal, uranium, steel and agricultural products, and
prohibition of new U.S. investment in South Africa, landing rights
for South African airlines and new bank loans to the country.
   Pretoria in recent weeks has freed several political prisoners
and prominent opposition leaders.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said de Klerk had made a ``bold stroke
for freedom,'' but that Bush has promised to consult with Congress
before he takes any action.
   Lugar added, ``The trend in events is South Africa has been a
strong one toward negotiation.''
   In Washington, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said ``we must balance
hope with caution. Caution because the structure of apartheid is
still in place and Nelson Mandela is still in jail.''
   Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, a
Washington lobbying organization, said ``celebration would be
premature. ... as long as the apartheid system remains in place, as
it does, we must sustain in the United States the imposition of
economic sanctions.''
   As rumors of Mandela's imminent release circulated, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater has said President Bush would
invite him to the White House and invite de Klerk in a separate
visit.
   There was talk last year of a visit by de Klerk to Washington,
but it failed to materialize in the face of controversy over
whether Bush should receive a leader whose government enforces
official apartheid policies of racial separation.
   Bush reacted to the news from South Africa as he was leaving
Friday for a trip to Raleigh, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn., to
spotlight his budget proposals on science and research and
development.
   The president said the news from South Africa was ``quite
positive.''
   ``I'm very encouraged by some of the changes that have taken
place and certainly by representations yesterday by Mr. de Klerk,''
he said.
   The Bush administration has made few public pronouncements on
South Africa, maintaining opposition to the apartheid policies but
not taking any new initiatives in the region.

   Authorities have decided not to cut off
the limbs of 12 prisoners condemned to that punishment under
Islamic law, and similar cases are under review, the chief justice
said.
   The Sudan News Agency said Friday that Chief Justice Kamil Ali
Lutfi had also ordered retrials for some people sentenced to
various punishments under Islamic law.
   The news agency gave no reason for Lutfi's actions. However, Lt.
Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's 7-month-old military government has
come under strong criticism from the Amnesty International human
rights group and other Western agencies and governments for alleged
violations of human rights.
   In 1983, Sudan began a strict interpretation of Islamic law,
which decrees that a thief's limbs must amputated, an adultress
must be stoned to death and people who drink alcohol must be
flogged.
   Murder was made punishable by death, unless the victim's kin
accepts payment from the culprit.
   However, Lutfi has begun reviewing dozens of such sentences
imposed under the tough Islamic penal code, which is called hudud,
the news agency said.
   ``We will reconsider those sentences,'' he was quoted as saying.
   On Thursday, the first day of Lufti's review, he told 12 inmates
each sentenced to having an arm and leg lopped off that he was
changing their punishments to prison terms of five to 10 years.
   The change triggered speculation that the move was made under
pressure from moderate military men inside and outside the ruling
15-member junta to get the government to improve its image.
   President Gaafar Nimeiri, deposed by the military in 1985 after
a 16-year rule, imposed Islamic law in 1983. Several dozen people
convicted of theft had limbs cut off in the 20 months before his
overthrow.
   Nimeiri's action brought criticism from neighboring Egypt and
Western countries, including the United States. It also has added
fuel to a southern rebellion launched by the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   After Nimeiri's fall, courts continued to hand down sentences in
accordance with the hudud. But the sentences were not carried out
and remained suspended until the chief justice's review began on
Thursday.
   Police Brig. Gen. Al-Kamil M. Soleiman of the Prisons
Administration said there were 40 convicts in jail who must pay
money to the families of murder victims.
   Another 37 prisoners had been sentenced to limb amputations and
were waiting for them to be carried out, he said.
   The news agency quoted Lutfi as saying he had ordered ordered
retrials for some of those sentenced under hudud. He did not
specify the number.

<TEXT>
   The State Department's annual human rights
report ``doesn't pull any punches'' in describing abuses by China
in its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, according to a
congressional source familiar with the report.
   The frankness of the document surprised some congressional
figures who expected the Bush administration to mute criticism of
China as it presses for better relations with Beijing.
   `It describes every human rights crime you can think of,'' a
source who had seen the unreleased report said Friday night.
   ``Murders, disappearances, executions, suppression of labor
rights, religious persecution of Catholics and Buddhists, slave
labor camps in western China _ you name it, it's in there,'' said
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The administration has asserted it is important to maintain a
dialogue with Chinese leaders to encourage liberalization.
   Bush successfully vetoed a bill protecting Chinese students
against deportation, arguing he had accomplished the same
objectives through administrative action, and has sent high-level
emissaries to China twice since last summer's bloody suppression of
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   ``We expected, in light of those visits, that they might go
somewhat easy on the Chinese, but they didn't,'' said a second
congressional source who also has seen the report.
   ``The report doesn't pull any punches,'' said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The second source said the document avoided high-temperature
rhetoric, confining itself to ``factual and accurate'' statements.
   NBC News reported first on the report Friday evening.
   The network quoted from the document: ``As of year's end, there
were continuing reliable reports of beatings of political detainees
in the Beijing area by security forces ... prisoners, both criminal
and political, are subjected to severe psychological pressure to
confess.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger is scheduled to
appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on successive days next week. The two
congressional sources said he was certain to be questioned about
the document.
   The annual report is given to the House or Senate committees in
alternate years, and was scheduled for release Feb. 21 by the House
committee.
   Congressional Democrats and even many Republicans have attacked
Bush for moving too rapidly to re-establish ties with China since
the Tiananmen Square massacre and say Beijing has made only
cosmetic changes since June.
   China was one of the major criticisms of House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., in responding to Bush's State of the Union address
on Wednesday.
   Earlier this week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in
testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, listed in
his advance text Cuba and China as countries who ``try to shut out
democratic values,'' but in actually speaking the words omitted the
reference to China.
   Bush has said he was pleased by the Chinese government's recent
lifting of martial law and release of some prisoners.

<BYLINE>Bush Voids China's Purchase of Aircraft Parts Company
^By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says his decision to void
China's purchase of a Seattle aircraft parts company was made on
national security grounds and not to discourage Chinese investment
in the United States.
   Bush on Friday ordered the divestiture of the Mamco
Manufacturing Co. of Seattle by the China National Aero-Technology
Import and Export Corp., which is owned by the Chinese government.
   Bush's action on Mamco, which manufactures metal parts for
aircraft, upheld the recommendation of an interagency panel.
   In a report to Congress, Bush said his action was based on ``a
particular transaction'' and does not reflect a policy shift.
   ``It does not change our open investment policy and is not a
precedent for the future with regard to direct investment of the
United States from the People's Republic of China or any other
country,'' Bush said.
   Even so, his move was likely to help mute widespread criticism
in Congress that Bush has been too conciliatory toward the Beijing
government since its brutal crackdown on China's pro-democracy
movement.
   Citing ``credible confidential information,'' Bush negated the
December 1988 acquisition on national security grounds. The Chinese
corporation was given three months to sell all its holdings in the
company, with the possibility of a single three-month extension.
   Bush's order invoked for the first time a provision of a 1988
trade law that gives the president power to restrict foreign
investment in the United States if the nation's security may be
harmed.
   The president ordered the Chinese government to sell the company
because ``continued control of Mamco might threaten to impair the
national security,'' the White House said in a statement. It did
not elaborate on what harm might result from the Chinese ownership.
   The action came a week after Bush's veto of a bill extending
visas of Chinese students in the United States was narrowly
sustained by the Senate. Bush called the legislation an
infringement on his presidential foreign policy prerogatives.
   But some members of Congress argued Bush has acted too quickly
to step up contacts with the Beijing government, which they said
has done little to loosen its staunch control since the Tiananmen
Square crackdown last June.
   Sanctions Bush imposed after the crackdown bar all military
sales to China. However, Bush's order on Friday did not allege a
violation of those sanctions in the relationship between Mamco and
China.
   The interagency panel that reviewed Mamco found the Seattle
company, which reported $20 million in sales in 1988, was involved
with sensitive materials that could have military applications,
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Chinese corporation is part of the Chinese Ministry of
Aerospace Industry. It has business dealings with various U.S.
companies ``in several sectors, including commercial aircraft,''
the White House statement said.
   Bush acted under the so-called Exon-Florio provision of 1988
trade legislation that allows a president to intervene to bar
foreign investment in the United States on national security
grounds.
   The legislation is named after Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., and
former Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., now the governor of New Jersey.

<HEAD>Former Joint Chiefs See Less Need for U.S. Mobile Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should kill plans to
upgrade its land-based, nuclear missile force if a U.S.-Soviet pact
is signed on strategic weapons and mobile missiles, say three
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``I just don't see the great need for modernization of that
element right now,'' retired Gen. David Jones, who served as joint
chiefs chairman in the early 1980s, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Friday.
   Asked whether one part of the strategic deterrent could be
dropped, the former chairmen agreed on drastically scaling back
plans to build more multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missiles and to
deploy the new, single-warhead Midgetman.
   ``I would cancel the two land-based missiles,'' said retired
Gen. John Vessey, who was joint chiefs chairman in the mid-1980s.
``I think the idea that someone's going to attack our silo-based
missile forces, ... it's just not reasonable now.''
   Retired Adm. William Crowe, who stepped down last October as
chairman of the joint chiefs, agreed with Vessey, and noted the
United States has ``a mobile missile in the field _ the seaborne
mobile missile'' on submarines.
   The comments by the former military leaders prompted the
committee's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., to say that unless the
administration pushes for a ban on multiple-warhead missiles in a
strategic arms control pact, he would not support the MX and
Midgetman.
   ``I sold a lot of people on that _ people on both sides of this
issue _ that I thought a ban on mobile (multiple warheads) was
going to be forthcoming from the White House ..., '' Nunn said.
``There is no way that I can support two missiles this year with
the current arms control position that we have.''
   The United States and Soviet Union are working on a treaty that
would cut their long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50
percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece.
   However, the two sides disagree over how to count air-launched
cruise missiles, how to handle undeployed missiles and U.S.
allegations that the Soviets have encoded data transmissions from
ballistic missile tests in violation of arms accords.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to discuss the
issues with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze when the
two meet next week in Moscow.
   The administration's new budget released Monday proposes
spending $2.8 billion to fund rail-basing of the MX and $202
million for the truck-based Midgetman.
   Fifty MX missiles are already in silos, along with the older
Minuteman long-range missile force, and the administration wants to
put 50 more MXs on rail cars to make them less vulnerable to attack.
   Vessey emphasized any action on the MX and Midgetman should be
done along with a strategic arms control agreement with the Soviet
Union.
   ``I would not do this without forcing them to give up their
mobile (warheads),'' he said.
   Jones suggested some money should be left in the missile
programs for research and development.
   Nunn expressed dismay over the failure of the administration to
spell out its strategy and arms control agenda, especially in light
of the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   ``We're going to have an arms control position that's out of
sync with our strategic planning and our posture and it's just a
tragedy we can't get together on this,'' Nunn said. ``It's got to
start with some vision coming out of the White House and the
Department of Defense.''

   Marina Ogilvy, a pregnant 23-year-old cousin
of Queen Elizabeth II, gave up her longshot claim to the British
throne to marry the father of her child.
   Miss Ogilvy, due to give birth in May, had been 24th in line for
the throne. She forfeited that claim Friday by marrying a Roman
Catholic, freelance photographer Paul Mowatt, 26.
   When Miss Ogilvy told her parents she was pregnant, they
demanded she either marry quickly or have an abortion. When she
refused, they cut off her family allowance, she said in October.
   Her parents, Sir Agnus Ogilvy and Princess Alexandra, responded
by issuing a public statement saying they loved their daughter, had
not cut her off and that she always was welcome at their home.
   On Friday, she was greeted with a kiss from her father when she
arrived at St. Andrew's Church 10 miles southwest of London.
   Afterward, Ogilvy said he felt ``fine'' and was ``delighted,''
while Princess Alexandra declared: ``It was a lovely wedding.''
   The princess is sister of the Duke of Kent and is the queen's
first cousin. The 45-minute private service was attended by about
40 guests.

   The Dalai Lama was holding
``spiritual consultations'' with Czechoslovakia's
playwright-president as part of a five-day visit to Prague, the
official CTK news agency reported.
   The Tibetan spiritual leader, winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace
Prize, arrived Friday for a visit at the invitation of President
Vaclav Havel.
   Chinese diplomats criticized the invitation as an indication of
political support for Tibetan separatism. But Havel said the Dalai
Lama's visit was ``of a private nature.''
   ``I wanted to invite him a long time ago when I was not yet a
president,'' Havel said. ``I want to meditate with him.''
   The new government, which was installed after the November
democratic revolution, has sought to remove the sanctions against
religious observance placed by the former Communist regime.
   Havel and the Dalai Lama are scheduled to spend Sunday in
``spiritual consultations and meditations'' in the presidential
country residence at Lany, west of Prague. The Dalai Lama also
scheduled meetings with Czechoslovakia's Roman Catholic primate,
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, and with other religious
representatives, CTK reported.

   The church's Segye Times newspaper said 12 former presidents and
prime ministers of Bolivia, Costa Rica, Equador, Colombia and Peru
were among 5,000 celebrants at the bash Thursday at Olympic Park in

   Moon's church claims to have 4 million followers in 137

<HEAD>Sources: Iran-Contra Prosecutors Probing Former CIA Agent Clines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are investigating
whether former CIA operative Thomas G. Clines failed to report
income on his tax returns from arms transactions involving the
Contras, according to sources.
   The sources told The Associated Press Friday that Albert Hakim,
who was placed on two years probation and fined $5,000 for his role
in the Iran-Contra affair, is a key witness in the Clines
investigation.
   Hakim and business partner Richard Secord set up ``the
Enterprise,'' the network of offshore companies used to handle
money in the secret supply operation to the Contras and the Reagan
administration's sales of arms to Iran.
   Clines helped buy arms for the Contras starting in 1985 at the
rest of Secord. Some $972,728 in commissions were set aside for
Clines in the account of an entity code-named C. Tea, according to
the congressional Iran-Contra report issued in November 1987.
   Hakim didn't begin supplying Iran-Contra prosecutors with
information on the matter until he entered a plea agreement with
the government Nov. 21.
   In court papers, the government said Hakim has ``indicated his
willingness'' to give testimony ``in an anticipated future case''
and is cooperating in a grand jury investigation outside
Washington. The papers did not elaborate, but the sources,
commenting only on condition they not be named, told the AP the
subject of the investigation is Clines.
   Clines' attorney, John Ellsworth Stein, declined comment Friday.
   But other sources familiar with the situation say Clines did in
fact report money from the transactions on his tax returns. Clines
takes the position that he has reported all his income, the sources
said.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the Iran-Contra prosecutor's
office, declined to comment.
   Clines worked for the CIA for 30 years. He was an agent in
Southeast Asia, was involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba
and became director of training in the directorate of operations,
also known as the clandestine services.
   He also was a close associate of Edwin Wilson, the former CIA
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally
selling guns and explosives to Libya.
   Clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned
company to inflating bills submitted to the Defense Department for
shipping U.S. military equipment to Egypt. He was fined the maximum
$10,000 and paid the government $100,000 on behalf of his firm,
Systems Services International.

<TEXT>
   A day-care center owner who
allegedly took nude pictures of children in his care has been
hospitalized with a slashed wrist after an apparent suicide
attempt, police said.
   John Shaver, 56, was admitted as a psychiatric patient and
listed in fair condition Friday at Broward General Medical Center
after being found in a hotel bathtub with his right wrist cut, said
police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   Meanwhile, no evidence of physical abuse was found Friday in the
first of 14 children scheduled for medical and psychological exams
after their parents identified their pictures out of 200-300 nude
photos found at Shaver's house, one official said.
   Six children visited the county's Sexual Assault Treatment
Center Friday and none had been sexually assaulted, said center
director Joanne Richter. Eight more children were scheduled for
tests today.
   The pictures, which do not depict sex acts or sexual poses, show
the children wet or in a wading pool and often covered with finger
paint, Cefkin said. More parents are expected to view the pictures
next week.
   Shaver, released on $5,000 bond Wednesday after his arrest
Sunday, admits owning the pictures that police confiscated but does
not consider them pornography. He faces five counts of possessing
child pornography for magazines found at his home, just across the
street from his Rainbow Learning Center.
   Possessing child pornography is a third-degree felony in Florida
and punishable by a maximum five-year prison sentence, said Dave
Casey of the Fort Lauderdale State Attorney's office.
   Shaver, who checked into the Guest Quarters Hotel Thursday, was
found Friday in the tub dressed only in shorts. His right wrist had
been cut with a serrated knife blade. In the room, police found
seven empty 1-ounce liquor bottles and two notes.
   One note reiterated his denial that he took nude photos of
children, and said it was easier to kill himself than deal with the
situation, Cefkin said. The second note apologized to the hotel
staff for the mess he would leave.
   Police also found a copy of the search warrant of his home and a
printout of his money-market account, which showed Shaver was
``quite wealthy,'' Cefkin said.
   The children identified in the photos reported to the Sexual
Assault Treatment Center for medical tests and interviews, director
Richter said. The medical tests are ``mostly to alleviate the fears
of the parents, and rule out the possibility of actual sexual
abuse,'' she said.
   Although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under
the law, they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against
Shaver if the evidence meets that criteria, Cefkin said.
   ``Our primary interest is the children,'' he said. ``We're not
going to subject a child to the criminal justice system if it's not
warranted.''
   Broward County officials shut down Shaver's day-care center
Thursday, contending Shaver ``lacked good moral character.''
   Shaver opened the day-care center in 1985 for children ages 3 to
5. Thirty children, mostly 4 and 5, attended the center at the time
it closed, and about 200 have attended since it opened.
   In 1984 in Hawaii, Shaver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge
of operating a day-care center without a license. The plea came a
year after the state of Hawaii revoked his license amid allegations
that he fondled several young girls at his center. He was never
criminally charged and Shaver denied any wrongdoing.

   The Lebanese government of Elias Hrawi has
control of the nation's embassy in the United States after a
federal judge ended a dispute that reflected the violent divisions
in Beirut.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene on Friday dismissed a lawsuit
by the former Lebanese ambassador to Washington, an ally of the
Lebanese Christian military leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Hours later, the embassy was turned over to Hrawi
representatives, said the Secret Service, which is responsible for
security at embassies.
   ``The transition occurred smoothly and there were no
difficulties,'' said Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams, although
he said there was some shouting between the two factions as they
were watched closely by Secret Service officers.
   Greene ruled that former ambassador Abdallah Bouhabib, who was
trying to avoid being evicted, was given adequate notice that the
United States was recognizing Hrawi's new government. Greene denied
the request for a preliminary injunction by a Lebanese faction to
which Bouhabib remains loyal.
   The Hrawi government has designated the former Lebanese consul
in Washington, Bassam Naamani, as charge d'affaires pending the
arrival of a new ambassador. Naamani has been working in a
commercial office arranged by the Arab League.
   Bouhabib became Lebanese ambassador to the United States in
1983. Hrawi was elected president on Nov. 24 and dismissed Aoun,
who refuses to recognize the rival Christian government.
   When a group of demonstrators supporting Aoun temporarily
occupied parts of the embassy in Washington Jan. 22, Bouhabib was
told the U.S. government would send law enforcement personnel to
the premises the next day to remove him and all those attached to
the Aoun regime.
   The Aoun faction filed suit against the secretary of state.
   In court papers, the State Department said it notified Bouhabib
Dec. 11 that he was no longer Lebanese ambassador.

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school superintendent reinstated a
teacher and librarian who were suspended after high school students
were shown the R-rated film ``Catch-22.''
   La Cueva High School teacher Joyce Briscoe and librarian Pauline
Jones had been suspended Wednesday with pay after the film was
shown to college-bound juniors in Ms. Briscoe's English class. The
film had been checked out of the school library.
   Officials said the two were reinstated Friday after they learned
that ``Catch-22'' was rated PG at Albuquerque's Manzano High.
   Superintendent Jack Bobroff said the two would return to work
Monday. He said he suspended them ``not for disciplinary reasons
but as standard procedure to handle potentially disruptive
situations and in situations where school policy has not been
strictly adhered to.''
   But Richard D. Heffner, chairman of the board of the
Classification and Ratings Administration for the Motional Picture
Association of America, said late Friday that the PG rating was a
mistake. He said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles that
``Catch-22'' has always been rated R.
   School guidelines released Jan. 10 require a committee to review
films rated PG-13 or R before they are shown. The principal would
then review the committee's recommendations and make a decision. An
R-rated film at a movie theater requires children under age 17 to
be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.
   Ms. Briscoe, meanwhile, said in a statement that she and Ms.
Jones were pleased to be returning to work. She also thanked her
colleagues and city residents for their support.
   Ms. Briscoe had sparked controversy last fall when she showed
students with parental permission ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' which some religious groups find offensive.
   La Cueva student body president Randy Puro, one of Ms. Briscoe's
students, said before the reinstatement that students had believed
``their rights as individuals have been taken away.''
   ``If people think movies are going to corrupt kids, as far as
I'm concerned, the news on TV is going to corrupt kids,'' he said.
   La Cueva students and teachers circulated petitions supporting
the two, and the Albuquerque Federation of Teachers had filed a
grievance asking that Ms. Briscoe and Ms. Jones be immediately
reinstated.
   School board president Diego Gallegos said district
administration probably overreacted to the ``Catch-22'' screening
because of the furor over ``Last Temptation.''
   ``Catch-22,'' based on Joseph Heller's novel of the same name,
portrays life in a U.S. bomber squadron during World War II. The
book is on the national advanced placement reading list for honors
students.
   The 1970 film directed by Mike Nichols stars Alan Arkin, Jon
Voight, Orson Welles, Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkel, Anthony
Perkins and Bob Newhart.

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are criticizing the
insurance industry for socking the elderly with huge price
increases for ``medigap'' health policies and say tougher
regulation may be needed to curb price and marketing abuses.
   ``Millions of seniors spend billions of dollars each year on
medigap policies and many are being ripped off and cheated out of
their limited fixed incomes,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told a
Senate Finance subcommittee on Friday.
   ``This medigap mess has flourished because federal regulation is
a voluntary, unenforceable patchwork of legal mumbo-jumbo, more
loophole than law,'' he said.
   Private insurance companies sell medigap policies to the elderly
to bridge gaps in their coverage from Medicare. Premiums are rising
sharply this year. Insurers say the increases are justified because
health-care costs are rising and because benefits must be provided
that previously were offered under Medicare's catastrophic-care
program.
   But several members of the Senate subcommittee on Medicare and
long-term care questioned whether the big rate increases are
warranted, even with rising costs and the repeal of the
catastrophic-care program.

^Government Urges Delay in Use of Reagan Diary

   The Justice Department is urging a delay in
turning over 33 excerpts from former President Reagan's diaries to
Iran-Contra defendant John Poindexter and says a summary of the
entries should be compiled for Poindexter's use instead.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene had set a deadline of
Monday for Reagan to give the nearly three dozen excerpts to his
former national security adviser, who is scheduled to go on trial
Feb. 20.
   In urging a postponement, the Justice Department said Friday
that many of the 33 entries duplicate material that came to light
in last year's Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide Oliver
North.
   ``Indeed, there may be no information in the diary entries
covered by'' Greene's court order ``that is not in the public
domain,'' the Justice Department said in a five-page brief.
   It said Iran-Contra prosecutors and Poindexter's lawyers should
attempt to draft a stipulation covering the facts contained in the
diary entries. Greene can then compare the proposed stipulation
with the diary entries ``to ensure that all pertinent information
has been covered,'' said the Justice Department.
   A stipulation is an agreement on facts by both sides in a
lawsuit.

<HEAD>Senators Say Bush's Budget Would Cut Drug Fight On Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed budget could gut
efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico
border, contrary to administration promises to step up law
enforcement on the front lines, area Democrats say.
   The Southwest border's four Democratic senators said Friday that
Bush's budget seeks personnel reductions in three federal law
enforcement agencies that could seriously affect their operations
along the border.
   Bush released his budget Monday, four days after declaring the
Southwest border, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City
were ``high intensity drug trafficking areas'' eligible for
hundreds of additional law enforcement agents and millions of
dollars in additional federal aid.
   But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the benefit of being
targeted for more help has been undercut by the president's budget,
which seeks reductions for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
   According to Bentsen and fellow Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a total of
636 positions would be cut from Customs, 423 from the INS, and 185
from the ATF, the lead agency on the border for gang enforcement
and firearms investigations.
   The senators, in a letter Friday to William J. Bennett, director
of the office of national drug control policy, ask his help in
restoring these law enforcement positions to federal agencies
``which are this nation's front line forces in the war on drugs.''

   A powerful state senator who was found
guilty of corruption by a federal court jury now faces the prospect
of a jury of his 38 colleagues.
   A U.S. District Court jury on Fridday found state Sen. Joseph
Montoya guilty of one count of racketeering, one count of money
laundering and five counts of extortion.
   He was found innocent of three other extortion counts, including
one that accused him of asking for money from actor Ed Asner and
the Screen Actors Guild in exchange for help with legislation.
   Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and Professions
Committee, is the first California legislator in 35 years to be
convicted of a felony while in office.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz set sentencing for April 26.
Until then, Montoya will remain free on his own recognizance.
   He faces a potential maximum sentence of 125 years in prison and
a $1.75 million fine, according to prosecutors, who said they would
ask for a prison sentence.
   But the guilty verdicts did not cost Montoya his Senate seat. It
would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to expel Montoya from
the Legislature if he doesn't resign first.
   Defense attorney Michael Sands refused to say Friday if Montoya
planned to step down.
   Senate leader David Roberti of Los Angeles said in a brief
statement that he would talk to Montoya and convene a Senate Rules
Committee hearing on Monday to consider Montoya's status.
   Many said the conviction would almost certainly put more
pressure on legislators to enact tougher standards of ethics for
themselves.
   Common Cause, a citizens group that supports political reform
measures, said Montoya's conviction ``further diminished the
reputation of a once respected institution, and, if nothing else,
reaffirmed the need for comprehensive ethics and campaign finance
reform legislation.''
   Montoya, who sat between his attorneys at the defense table,
seemed to pale when Schwartz read the guilty verdict on the first
count.
   Montoya, 50, refused to speak to reporters afterwards and left
the courthouse through a security gate as U.S. marshals blocked the
media.
   Sands said he would appeal the verdict.
   Jurors, who deliberated 18 hours over four days, said they had a
difficult time reaching their verdicts.
   ``It was not an easy decision,'' said juror Emily Ingram of
Benicia. ``We toiled over it. A few of us lost sleep; some of us
could not eat.''
   Montoya's former top aide, Amiel Jaramillo, was indicted with
the senator and is scheduled to go on trial next month on
racketeering and extortion charges.

<HEAD>Government Rules Noriega a POW, But Still can be Prosecuted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega has been
given prisoner-of-war status, but the U.S. government said he still
will face drug trafficking charges in federal court.
   The government filed its response to counter defense arguments
that civilian courts have no jurisdiction over Noriega and
co-defendant Luis del Cid, who surrendered to U.S. troops following
the invasion of Panama.
   ``The government intends to provide prisoner-of-war treatment to
Noriega and del Cid,'' said the 39-page federal document filed
Friday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said the
government agrees the Geneva Convention covers the hostilities in
Panama.
   But the Geneva Convention also allows for the prosecution of
POWs for offenses committed before the time they came into U.S.
custody, Sullivan said.
   U.S. Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said
prisoner-of-war status means Noriega can direct any complaints
about prison conditions to a U.S. military liaison officer already
designated by the Defense Department, but he will not be moved to a
military facility.
   ``Even if Noriega and del Cid are considered to be `prisoners of
war' within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, they are not
entitled to dismissal of the charges against them,'' read the
response filed with U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   The judge has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the issue of
his jurisdiction and Noriega's POW status.
   Prior to the prosecution's response, del Cid's attorney Samuel
Burstyn filed his own motion Friday demanding his client's release.
   Burstyn cited a federal appeals court case, U.S. vs. Toscanino,
which says a prisoner should be released if the court ``finds that
the United States government deliberately and unreasonably
exploited illegal conduct in an outrageous fashion.''
   Burstyn said that should apply to the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``The U.S. government illegally dispatched 25,000 agents
(members of the U.S. armed forces and others) to forcibly enter the
Republic of Panama,'' said the motion.
   He said the government was ``in effect kidnapping him to the
United States'' with the invasion.
   Noriega and del Cid face drug-trafficking and money-laundering
charges in a 12-count February 1988 indictment, which accuses them
of turning Panama into a safe haven and shipment point for
U.S.-bound cocaine.

   A U.S. businessman who's worried that that
perestroika might fail wants Americans to buck up Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev by sending him a dollar in care of the Kremlin.
   ``I'm asking the public to spend the price of a good lottery
ticket,'' Robert Forrest said Friday. ``This is the biggest lottery
in the world. I'm asking people to take a chance on Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``It's a way to help'' Gorbachev's reform movement, Forrest
said. ``He needs a little help from his friends right now.''
   Forrest, an Oregon mortgage broker who is president of a gold
mine in California, is promoting his campaign with bumper stickers
emblazoned: ``Send a Buck to Gorbachev.''
   ``I think people all over the world are saying, `This could go
either way,''' he said. ``If we could get an outpouring of support
all over the world, we might influence the outcome. The intent is
to write a letter, even if you don't send any money.''
   Forrest already has sent his letter to Gorbachev.
   ``I want you to use that $1 to buy soap or bread or milk, meat,
butter or shoes or whatever it is that your people need that will
help you succeed in your reformation of the Soviet society and
economy,'' Forrest wrote.

<HEAD>Swiss Drug Company Buys Majority Share of Genentech for $2.1
Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Swiss drug company will
become the majority stockholder of Genentech Inc., the world's
leading biotechnology company, in a $2.1 billion deal some say will
boost long-term research.
   Robert Swanson, founder of Genentech, said Friday the merger
with Roche Holding Ltd. was made because ``huge investments are
needed to get new products to the market.''
   Swanson, named chairman of the board on Friday, said at a news
conference announcing the transaction that the company will have
``the resources and the independence to fully deliver the dream of
biotechnology.''
   Swanson referred to the 14-year-old company's need to be free
from Wall Street pressures to deliver quarterly profits, which have
been needed to invest in products still in development and two or
three years from term.
   Genentech has been the clear leader in biotechnology, racking up
profits every year since 1979 except for one, and has a scientific
staff considered the biggest and best in the field.
   But the company's stock was depressed on Wall Street and the
company sought a corporate partner to provide funds for development
and meet increasing competition on its two existing products.
   Genentech hopes to sell more of TPA or Activase, which helps
dissolve blood clots in heart attack victims, and human growth
hormone, a treatment for children with pituitary dwarfism.
   Sales of TPA failed to live up to expectations in 1988, its
first full year on the market. The disappointing results turned
Genentech ``from a darling to a dog on Wall Street,'' as The New
York Times characterized it, and its stock plummeted.
   ``We have so much we want to do ... and the quarterly pressures
of the stock market would inevitably inhibit our abilities to take
advantage of the brain trust that works on these 30 acres here,''
said G. Kirk Raab, Genentech's president and chief executive
officer, referring to company headquarters.
   Analysts generally hailed the agreement, saying it would give
Genentech the cash it needs to invest heavily in research and free
the company from Wall Street pressures.
   ``It's an incredible deal for Genentech in that Roche made the
purchase not for immediate results on some products, but for the
whole, overall goal of gaining the cutting edge of biotechnology
research, which is something that's going to come years down the
road,'' said Bob Cuper, a Genentech analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. in New York.
   Under the agreement, Roche will invest $492 million in
Genentech, buying half its 82 million shares of outstanding stock
for $36 per share _ 65 percent above Thursday's closing stock price.
   Genentech was the most active issue Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, rising $8.12{ to close at $29.87{.
   Roche will own 60 percent of the 112 million voting shares of
Genentech stock that will be outstanding after the companies
restructure and merge, the companies said.
   Genentech will remain a publicly traded company under the deal,
they said. The proposal will be submitted to Genentech stockholders
in April; the board of directors on Friday approved the agreement.
   Officials of both companies said Genentech's management and
research division would operate independently of Roche, and that
Genentech's sales force would remain intact and all the company's
employees retained.
   Although it will become major shareholder, Roche will be given
only two seats on Genentech's board of directors, which will be
expanded by two members for a total of 13.

   The lawyer for reputed mob boss John Gotti
called a surprise witness on his client's behalf: the union
official who prosecutors say was ordered shot by the defendant.
   John O'Connor testified Friday in the assault and conspiracy
trial of Gotti that he didn't know who had shot him and that police
had given him no warning he was in danger.
   Prosecutors say Gotti had ordered O'Connor shot for leading
union goons to wreck a Manhattan restaurant affiliated with the
Gambino crime family, which Gotti reputedly heads.
   They maintain that a secretly recorded tape shows Gotti saying
O'Connor was to be ``busted up.''
   The defense, arguing the tapes are largely inaudible, said that
if the comment was clear enough to prosecute Gotti then it was
clear enough to warn O'Connor.
   Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, an alleged Gambino
soldier, are on trial in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on charges
of assault and conspiracy in the O'Connor shooting.
   Under questioning by defense lawyer Gerald Shargel, O'Connor
detailed the near-fatal shooting of May 7, 1986.
   O'Connor, 56, said he noticed four or five men hanging around
outside the offices of his union local when he arrived at work.
   While waiting in the lobby for an elevator, O'Connor testified
he heard ``a thunderous clap'' and felt something in his body, but
did not realize he had been shot.
   A man shouted ``Mr. O'Connor, Mr. O'Connor.'' When he turned,
O'Connor saw a man pointing a gun at him. The elevator arrived, and
O'Connor said he got on as the gunman fired into his buttocks.
   O'Connor said he got off on the seventh floor when he sought
help from an acquaintance.
   Dr. Jose Corvalan, the surgeon who treated O'Connor at St.
Clair's Hospital, said the victim would have died without prompt
medical treatment.
   O'Connor said that, in viewing police photos, he was never able
to identify any of the men he saw outside his office the day he was
shot.
   He said he initially told police that union trouble had nothing
to do with the incident, but admitted in testimony that there were
internal problems in the union.
   The defense argued that O'Connor's enemies in his union might
have shot him because of internecine rivalries.
   Prosecutors, who rested their case Thursday, called O'Connor _
former vice president of Carpenters' Union Local 608 _ a corrupt
mob associate who has been charged in a 127-count indictment with
perjury, extortion, and labor racketeering.
   Cross-examined by Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky,
O'Connor asserted his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when asked about his alleged links to organized
crime.
   O'Connor took the stand after Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin
denied a defense motion to dismiss the case.
   Shortly after O'Connor testified, the defense rested. The trial
is recessed until Monday when final arguments are expected.

   Love letters written by actress
Roseanne Barr to Tom Arnold, her newlywed husband, have been stolen
and are being offered for sale to various periodicals, a publicist
said.
   ``Our purpose in sending the (announcement) out is to notify
people that these letters are stolen,'' publicist Alana Rothstein
said Friday.
   ``We're saying, `yes it is for real, and yes they are stolen,
and if somebody decides to publish them, then down the road they'll
have to deal with the repercussions.'''
   Barr's public relations firm had received inquiries from several
publishers who had been contacted by someone who was offering to
sell the letters.
   Rothstein said she didn't know how exactly how many letters were
stolen, or when. She said at least several letters were stolen
sometime within the last three weeks.
   Asked if the theft had been reported to police, Rothstein said
it was a legal matter and was being handled by Miss Barr's
attorneys.

   Until a year ago, F.W. De
Klerk was a low-key politician viewed as cautious, pragmatic and
relatively conservative. Now, the president is being called
courageous even by anti-apartheid militants who spent years in jail.
   De Klerk was raised in a culture that accepted white domination
as God's will. His father was in the Cabinet when African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela went to jail in 1962.
   On Friday, before a national television audience, de Klerk
announced that Mandela would soon be freed unconditionally and that
his guerrilla movement was no longer banned.
   ``In a matter of just over half an hour, Mr. de Klerk has set in
motion a process of peaceful revolution that will undo four decades
of doctrinaire National Party policies that have spelt misery for
millions,'' said the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, head of the country's
Methodist Church.
   Mogoba spent three years in prison in the 1960s for membership
in the Pan Africanist Congress, another black-led guerrilla group
legalized by de Klerk in hopes of promoting black-white
negotiations.
   De Klerk was education minister in Botha's Cabinet. Botha
suffered a stroke Jan. 18, 1989, and Feb. 2 _ exactly a year before
Friday's speech _ de Klerk took over as National Party leader,
narrowly defeating a Cabinet colleague who at the time was
considered more liberal.
   Botha resigned in August after losing a power struggle with the
Cabinet, and de Klerk became acting president. He was formally
inaugurated to a five-year term Sept. 20, following general
elections, and told the country: ``We stand on the threshold of a
new era in South Africa.''
   Now, even doubters are beginning to believe him.
   ``We would be unreasonable if we fail to acknowledge that of all
the presidents, of all the leaders of the Nationalist governments,
de Klerk has taken the most bold step, and has has emerged as the
most courageous,'' said black activist Pope Molefe.
   Molefe, a leader of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheid
coalition, was freed in December after more than four years in jail
when the appellate court overturned a treason conviction.
   De Klerk, 53, comes from a long line of politicans going back to
his great-grandfather, a senator. His brother, Willem, quit as
editor of Rapport, the country's largest Afrikaans-language
newspaper, after being criticized for his increasingly liberal
views.
   The Dutch-descended Afrikaners began settling South Africa 350
years ago and account for 3 million of the country's 5 million
whites. They are taught in state schools that role as rulers was
ordained by God. Until a few years ago, the main Afrikaner church
preached that the ideological foundation for apartheid was found in
the Bible.
   When F.W. de Klerk took office, Willem de Klerk expressed
uncertainty as to whether significant reforms would follow. But de
Klerk moved rapidly _ even before his inauguration he gave approval
for the first legal anti-government marches in decades.
   Since then, de Klerk has freed eight prominent political
prisoners, including colleagues of Mandela; declared an end to
segregation of beaches; consulted with Mandela and many
anti-apartheid leaders, and cut back the power and influence of the
security establishment.
   He halved mandatory military service for white men from two
years to one, cut the defense budget, and scrapped a controversial
bureaucratic network through which security force officers
exercised control over black townships.
   All these moves paled compared to Friday's pronouncements.
   Publisher Tertius Myburgh, whose Sunday Times is the country's
largest newspaper, called it the most important speech of the
century in South Africa.

<HEAD>Genscher Says Baker Agrees Greater Germany Doesn't Mean Greater
NATO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's foreign minister says he and
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker agree that a unified Germany
will not mean a greater NATO military umbrella.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who met with Baker late
Friday at the State Department, said afterward, ``We were in full
agreement that there is no intention to extend the NATO area of
defensive security toward the East.''
   Genscher, who was returning to Europe during the night, crossed
the Atlantic and back in less than 24 hours to consult with Baker
before the Secretary of State's meetings next week with Soviet
leaders in Moscow. German unity was expected to be a major issue
Baker will take up with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Both Genscher and Baker said they agreed that if a 35-nation
European summit Gorbachev has proposed for next autumn is held, it
should add the right of free elections to other human rights
enumerated at the original summit on cooperation and security in
Europe, held at Helsinki in 1972.
   Genscher suggested the autumn summit could set the stage for
major steps toward German unification.
   Unlike Helsinki, ``the two German states at this summit will
come not with diverging views but _ as I hope _ with a joint
concept,'' he said.
   Genscher's whirlwind visit came after Gorbachev softened his
opposition to German unification over the past week. East German
Prime Minister Hans Modrow also endorsed creation of a single
Germany, providing it belongs neither to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization nor to the Warsaw Pact.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has opposed
military neutrality for a unified Germany. Baker also indirectly
rejected the idea, telling reporters Friday, ``I'm frankly
encouraged'' by what Genscher has said about continued German
membership in NATO.
   Western allied governments, remembering the struggle against
Nazi Germany in World War II, have long considered West Germany's
membership in NATO and the European Community more effective than
neutrality in deterring any revival of German expansionism.
   Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, after ending 40 years of
communist rule, have asked the Kremlin to withdraw its military
forces from their soil, drawing predictions the Warsaw Pact will
collapse.
   Genscher said the West can offer East European countries
``partnership in stability.''
   ``We can make it quite clear to the East that whatever happens
in the Warsaw pact, on our side there is no intention to extend our
area, NATO's area, toward the East,'' he said.
   Baker said he and Genscher ``agreed we need to develop a process
and a framework for it (reunification), taking into consideration
the interests of all who are involved in the issue.''
   Genscher said that after East Germany's promised March 18 free
elections, ``we are going to enter into negotiations with that
freely-elected government about the future of the two German states.
   ``And we are convinced that the freely-elected government of the
(East German) GDR, will just as ourselves, want to see the process
of a unity be imbedded in the process of European unity,'' he
added, suggesting major agreement could be reached by the autumn
summit.
   Baker planned to meet French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas in
Ireland on Tuesday before flying on to Prague for one day of talks
with Czechoslovakia's new leaders. From there he'll continue on to
Moscow.
   Genscher also planned to meet Shevardnadze next week.

<HEAD>Campaign Launched For Vote That Could Reshape Japan's Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 900 candidates hit a frosty campaign
trail today, officially launching a race that will provide the
first serious challenge to the conservative Liberal Democrats in
decades.
   The candidates, including Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of the
Liberal Democrats and Takako Doi of the Japan Socialist Party, came
out in bitter cold to lure voters to their parties in the Feb. 18
vote for parliament's lower house.
   Polls show the Liberal Democrats could lose their majority in
the powerful chamber, partly because of an unpopular 3 percent
sales tax and partly because of scandals that have soiled the
party's image over the past year. The party has controlled Japan's
government for 34 years.
   The contenders have been conducting unauthorized stumping for
months. But they intensified their efforts today with speeches at
major train stations as the official two-week campaign got under
way.
   Kaifu, 59, addressed about 200 people at Shibuya station in
Tokyo. Most of his audience, toting Japan's red-and-white flags,
appeared to be party members invited to the rally, with passersby
lingering in the near-freezing temperatures only until traffic
lights changed.
   Sounding his major theme, Kaifu declared that the election is a
``critical one that will determine whether the nation will give
credit to the Liberal Democrats for their efforts or give power
away to socialism.'' The Socialists are the largest opposition
party.
   ``My administration started out under the worst possible
circumstances,'' Kaifu said. ``I need your support.''
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned in April because of a
stock-profiteering scandal. His successor, Sousuke Uno, lasted only
two months after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses.
   The Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the upper house of
Parliament in July.
   At Shinjuku station in Tokyo, about 400 police guarded the
Socialists' kickoff rally.
   Ms. Doi, 61, told about 1,000 people that ``the only road left
is for each of you to change politics with your votes.''
   Flanked by waving girls in bright blazers and short skirts, Ms.
Doi reiterated her opposition to the sales tax and to recent moves
to open Japan's agricultural markets to imports. Those stands were
popular in the July election.
   Another key issue in the election is expected to be calls for
political reform prompted by the stock scandal.
   ``I don't really understand the differences in policies, but I'm
supporting the Socialists because I think it's time someone else
took over government,'' said one 22-year-old woman who refused to
give her name.
   ``Also, Doi is a woman, and I feel she wouldn't lie to me like
those men do,'' she said.
   A total of 931 candidates are expected to register their
candidacy for the 512-seat lower house, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Newspapers gave mixed reviews to Friday's debate between Kaifu,
Ms. Doi and three other party leaders, the first major televised
debate since 1960, saying the party leaders avoided the substantive
issues.
   The leaders ``failed to provide substantial new information for
the voters,'' said the English-language Japan Times. It attacked
Kaifu's campaign theme of warning voters that a vote for the
opposition would endanger their democratic freedoms, calling it
``scare tactics.''
   The mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun criticized the four
opposition leaders, saying they ``offered no image of what that
political authority ought to be.''

<HEAD>Washington State Wants to Kill Troublesome Sea Lions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hungry sea lions are beginning to fatten up on
the prized and protected steelhead trout, driving state authorities
to a drastic plan to end the free lunch: They want to kill the
blubbery creatures.
   The easy pickings at the Ballard Locks have led wildlife
officials to try a number of remedies to get rid of the sea lions
as the state-protected steelhead begin their annual run.
   As many as 40 sea lions have gathered near the locks inside city
limits each winter for the past eight years to eat the trout, which
climb a fish ladder on their way from Puget Sound to freshwater
Lake Union, en route to upstream spawning grounds.
   The sea lions weigh up to 800 pounds, and they can eat 5 percent
of their body weight in fish each day.
   One option is a plan by state and federal officials to truck 10
male sea lions to their breeding grounds off Southern California
and harass the remainder with firecrackers, rubber-tipped arrows
and fish laced with ``vomit capsules.''
   Another plan would be to alter the structure of the locks, a
possibility under preliminary discussion with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, said Curt Smitch, director of the state Department of
Wildlife.
   But Smitch noted Friday that wildlife agents have tried just
about all the non-lethal actions they can think of.
   ``We would like to have access to that option,'' he said of the
proposal to kill. ``We think that we are trying to protect a
resource, which is Washington's wild steelhead.''
   Federal officials say they're researching the question of
whether sea lions protected under federal law can be killed if they
threaten to destroy the state-protected wild steelhead run, which
generally lasts from late February to April.
   A period of public comment is expected to begin by the next
month, Rolland Schmitten, Northwest regional director of the
National Marine Fisheries Service, said Friday.
   Representatives of environmental and animal rights groups did
not return calls for comment late Friday on the proposal to kill
the sea lions, which were at the locks eating steelhead, said
acting lockmaster Bill McGraw.
   Cynthia Rust, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace Action, said earlier
Friday she lacked details to comment on the trucking plan, but she
said the vomit capsules probably would not work.
   The sea lions weren't considered a problem until 1985, when they
caught 30 percent of the wild fish run. Last year they gobbled up
65 percent, and at the current rate the run would disappear within
a decade, Smitch said.
   This year, officials hope that more than a third of the
approximately 2,100 fish will survive to spawn.
   In past years, wildlife officials have tried chasing the sea
lions with boats, scaring them with firecrackers and taped sounds
of orca whales, their natural predator, feeding them chemical-laced
fish and keeping them from the fish with nets. Nothing worked.
   The sea lions managed to have their feast last year even though
37 of them were trucked 270 miles to the southern Washington coast.
Within an average of 12 days, 29 had returned to the locks _ in
time to eat steelhead.
   Washington state sent a letter last fall asking the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which enforces the Marine
Mammal Protection Act, for a ruling on whether killing sea lions
might be permitted.
   A federal ruling should be made by the end of this year after
the public comment period, in time for next year's steelhead run,
Schmitten said.
   In the next few weeks, wildlife agents plan to corral 10 sea
lions and haul them at a cost of about $15,000 to breeding grounds
in the Channel Islands, northwest of Los Angeles.
   Authorities hope the sea lions will stay there, or at least take
45 days to swim the 1,100 miles back to Seattle. That would give
the fish enough time to get to the spawning grounds, Smitch said.
   The sea lions will be tagged with radio transmitters to track
their movements and monitor whether the effort has been effective,
he said.

<HEAD>Poland Sees First Signs of Unemployment Under Economic Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of unemployment soared nearly 600
percent last month after the Solidarity-led government imposed a
host of market-oriented economic reforms.
   At the same time, prices rose by almost 70 percent, compared to
government projections of 50 percent, Finance Ministry
Undersecretary Andrzej Podsiadlo told a news conference Friday.
   The number of unemployed people registered with the government
grew from 9,600 in December to 55,800 in January, said government
spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska. The number of job vacancies
fell from 254,000 in late 1989 to 35,200 in January, she said.
   The Solidarity-led government, anticipating the first postwar
wave of unemployment, has set aside funds to provide social
benefits to up to 400,000 jobless people. However, critics of the
plan have said the number of unemployed could go much higher.
   The steepest price rises came at the beginning of the month,
when the government loosened controls on almost all goods and
increased the price of energy by up to 700 percent, Podsiadlo said.
But most producers, faced with a sharp decline in purchases, had to
begin reducing prices by the end of the month, he said.
   The government hopes that by mid-year, prices will be rising by
only 1 or 2 percent a month, he said.
   The government's economic shock treatment calls for a tight
money policy limiting state subsidies and bank loans, limits on
wage growth, and the loosening of price controls.
   The program, approved by the International Monetary Fund, is
designed to quickly bring Poland's 1989 annual inflation rate of
700 percent under control by limiting the amount of money consumers
have to spend. It is also supposed to drive inefficient companies
into bankruptcy.
   The Solidarity-led government took over in September of last
year after the opposition scored an overwhelming victory over
Communist candidates in June elections.

<HEAD>Factory Closes; Detroit Left With One Auto Assembly Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motor City was down to its last auto assembly
plant with the closing of Chrysler Corp's Jefferson Avenue factory.
   After 83 years and about 8.3 million cars, the plant on
Detroit's lower east side closed Friday. It had been the nation's
oldest active auto factory.
   Its last car was a gray Dodge Omni with a gray interior.
   ``The days are gone forever when you didn't even have to
graduate from high school before you went down to Dodge or Ford or
Chrysler or GM and got a job,'' said Jesse Sandifer, 47, a pipe
fitter.
   ``We were fortunate enough to be the last of a dying breed. Now
you must have an education in order to succeed in life.''
   The last full assembly plant in Detroit is General Motors
Corp.'s Poletown plant. Several other factories in the city
manufacture auto parts.
   Some of the 1,700 workers being laid off indefinitely hope they
will go back to work in late 1991 at the Chrysler's planned
Jefferson North plant, which will be built next to the closed
factory.
   Ralph Winchester of Warren, who worked at the plant for a
quarter-century, said he was unsure of his plans.
   ``I'm just going to get settled and see what happens,'' he said.
   Winchester said he hopes that he'll be recalled late next year,
when Chrysler begins training workers for its Jefferson North
plant, where the company hopes to build a sport-utility vehicle by
late 1992.
   But, he added, ``I didn't get any guarantees.''
   Harry Anderson, who also closed out 25 years with Chrysler on
Friday, said he wasn't counting on work at the Jefferson North
plant. He went through another closing in January 1980, when
Chrysler shut down its Dodge Main plant, and he said he's had
enough of layoffs.
   ``I'm going to school for robotics and TV and radio repair,''
Anderson said.
   The laid-off workers can draw from a variety of funds that could
bring benefits to as much as 95 percent of their straight-time pay
while they were working.
   Officials of United Auto Workers union Local 7, which represents
the Jefferson Avenue workers, doubt if the funds will stay at that
level until retraining for Jefferson North begins.
   They said layoffs the automaker already has announced for later
this year will boost the number of eligible workers _ those on
indefinite layoff _ drawing against the funds. Between now and the
end of March, Chrysler plans to indefinitely lay off nearly 6,000
workers.
   ``All of us in America have got to turn this thing around,''
said Larry Gorzelski, a tool room supervisor at Jefferson Avenue.
``We're losing all our jobs, and pretty soon this will be just a
service industry.''
   Jefferson Avenue is the second plant Chrysler has shut down
since 1988. On Thursday, the company announced it would close its
St. Louis car plant in mid-September.
   That closing will bring to seven the number of assembly plants
Chrysler and General Motors Corp. will have shut down in three
years.
   Ford Motor Co. has been able to avoid closing plants because its
car and truck sales are healthy and it can eliminate large amounts
of overtime it used instead of opening a new plant.

<HEAD>Regents Keep ROTC but Order Lobbying of Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Board of Regents allowed ROTC to stay
at the University of Wisconsin after the school's faculty said it
wanted them off because of the military's restrictions against
homosexuals.
   The board decided 13-3 Friday to accept UW President Kenneth
Shaw's recommendation against evicting the Reserve Officers
Training Corps.
   But regents also approved a resolution that requires UW
administrators to report annually on their efforts to lobby
Congress for a change in the military's restrictions against
enlisting gays and lesbians.
   ``We intend to hold their feet to the fire,'' Regent Ruth Clusen
said. ``Writing letters isn't going to get us anywhere.''
   ``I think it was the appropriate resolution to pass,'' Regent
Erroll Davis Jr. of Madison said. ``This resolution keeps the issue
in the front line and will force us to deal with it.''
   Capt. Cheryl Batterman, head of UW recruiting for the Air Force
ROTC, said she was pleased the regents decided to keep ROTC. But
she said the resolution makes the situation seem uncertain and may
discourage enrollment.
   ``We're already feeling the pinch,'' Ms. Batterman said. ``I had
hoped they would've gotten this all resolved at once. Now, we still
don't know what might happen. That's a hard plan to sell to
students and parents.''
   The faculty senate voted 386-248 in December in favor of
evicting ROTC unless the military agreed by 1993 to enlist gays and
lesbians.
   About 200 people rallied at the campus earlier this week,
arguing it was unfair to make a student pay tuition for ROTC
courses and then deny him enlistment.
   Shaw said severing ties with ROTC probably wouldn't influence
the military. Canceling the courses would only harm the students
who benefit from the classes, he said.
   There are about 440 students in Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs at Madison out of an enrollment of 42,000. There are 1,300
ROTC students in the entire UW System, which has 135,000 students
at 13 major campuses and several smaller centers.

   For the seventh time in 5{ years,
Walt Disney World says it's raising the price at three theme parks.
   The prices will increase on Feb. 11 an average of 5 percent to
help pay for several new attractions, Disney spokesman John Dreyer
said Friday.
   ``We believe we are giving greater value to our guests and they
believe they are getting increased entertainment,'' said Dreyer,
pointing to the new ``Star Tours'' attraction at the Disney-MGM
Studios and ``Body Wars'' at Epcot Center.
   Disney last raised prices on May 1 to accompany the opening of
its $500-million Disney-MGM Studios, its third major park.

   Passengers arriving today on the ferry
from Lebanon's Christian enclave said the battles raging between
Christian factions are inflicting more damage on Beirut than any
others in 15 years of civil war.
   ``We never had a war like this,'' said 24-year-old Robin Haik.
   Like most of the 40 passengers on the boat, Haik was fleeing the
fighting that police say has killed at least 140 people and wounded
550 since it broke out Tuesday.
   Haik said he took advantage of a lull in the fighting to escape
brutal exchanges in Beirut's Ashrafiyeh district. Hundreds of
shells fell near his apartment building, he said.
   ``The Lebanese Forces put all kinds of artillery between every
house to try to get the army, and the army tried to hit them with
all kinds of shells.''
   The fighting pits Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's troops against
the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia headed by Samir
Geagea.
   Traffic on the coastal highway from Ashrafiyeh to the Christian
port at Jounieh, north of Beirut, was reduced because of sniper
fire and checkpoints set up by the opposing forces, Haik said.
   He said he had seen a car lying on the road with four dead
bodies in it.
   Crewmembers on the ferry Baroness said 200 burned cars littered
the parking lot at the port, evidence of the struggle for control
of the tiny naval facility held by Geagea's militia.
   ``One street is controlled by the army, the next by the Lebanese
forces. It's terrible,'' said crewmember Elie, who like his
colleagues wanted only his first name used.
   The ferry normally docks for several hours in Jounieh, but today
it stayed only a half hour before leaving on the seven-hour,
125-mile trip to Larnaca on southeastern Cyprus.
   Passengers said the sound of gunfire and rockets thundered
across the port. ``It was very bad. There were bombs, rockets. The
crewmembers were afraid, and so were the passengers,'' said Chief
Officer Demetris Asnasis.
   Most of those who made it onto the boat live in Jounieh and its
immediate surroundings.
   ``Our house is just two minutes from the port. That's how we
were able to get out,'' said Tony Helou, another passenger. ``We
don't want to go back again,'' said his wife, Susan.
   Aoun's forces attacked on Tuesday to try to gain full control of
the enclave north and east of Beirut where 1 million Christians
live. Geagea has 6,000 militiamen bolstered by several thousand
reservists. Aoun comands 20,000 soldiers.
   Aoun was fired by Moslem President Elias Hrawi, who was elected
in November under the terms of an Arab League-brokered peace plan
aimed at shifting political power to the Moslem majority and ending
a 15-year-old civil war. The war has left 150,000 people dead.
   Aoun says the peace plan, approved by Parliament in October,
provides no fixed withdrawal timetable for Syria's estimated 45,000
troops.
   Geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord, but
has recognized Hrawi as president.

   Attorney Barry Kane was sentenced to
12 years in federal prison and fined $500,000 after being convicted
of making two cocaine flights for Colombian drug baron Carlos
Lehder Rivas.
   Kane, 53, of Hyannis, Mass., was convicted in October in the
so-called ``Son of Lehder'' trial of conspiracy to import cocaine
into the United States. He made two 250-kilogram cocaine flights
from Colombia for Lehder in 1977.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II, who could have sentenced
Kane to 19 to 24 years under sentencing guidelines Friday, said he
gave the lesser sentence out of ``downright fairness.''
   As Kane was led out of the courtroom in shackles, his daughter
Jennifer, who had testified in his behalf, yelled, ``I love you,
Dad!''
   In a statement to Moore on Friday, Kane said that his life had
been destroyed, his career ruined and his family vilified and
devastated.
   ``I am sorry for having caused all of this. Hasn't there been
enough retribution? I pray your honor that there has been,'' Kane
said, his voice cracking.
   Three of Kane's sons and his daughter asked the judge for
leniency.
   ``There is nothing left to be taken. Everything is gone,'' said
his son Barry Stephen Kane, 30. ``I don't believe he's an evil man.
He's a man who made some mistakes. I'm begging for mercy.''
   Kane, who collapsed when he was convicted Oct. 26, seemed at
times to be shaky Friday.
   The case grew out of testimony in the 1987-88 trial of Lehder,
40, who is serving a life term plus 135 years for directing the
smuggling of some 20 tons of cocaine into the United States.
   Ten defendants have pleaded guilty and received sentences
ranging from six months to 10 years.

<HEAD>Population Growth Rate up Slightly in 1989</HEAD>

   China added another 15.77 million people last
year to bring its population to 1.112 billion, according to the
State Statistical Bureau.
   The bureau's figures, reported today by the official People's
Daily, said the natural population increase for the year was 14.33
per 1,000 people, up slightly from 14.2 per 1,000 in 1988.
   It said there were 20.83 births per 1,000, up from 20.78 in
1988, and 6.5 deaths per 1,000, a slight decline from the previous
year.
   The world's most populous nation in the past decade has achieved
one of the lowest growth rates in the developing world _ the rate
is 20 per thousand in India and 28 in the Philippines _ as a result
of strict family planning policies limiting most families to one
child.
   However, the natural growth rate has moved up again somewhat in
recent years because of resistance to the one-child policy in rural
areas and a sharp increase in the number of women reaching
childbearing age.
   Between 1986 and 1997, another 11 million to 13 million women
will reach childbearing age every year, a consequence of high birth
rates in the 1960s and 1970s when communist China's revolutionary
founder Mao Tse-tung paid little attention to family planning.
   China had hoped to keep its population down to 1.2 billion at
the end of the century, but demographers now say it will be closer
to 1.3 billion, about one-fifth of the world's people.
   ``From the viewpoint of age structure, our country will continue
to see a rising birth rate trend for the next few years,'' the
report said. ``Family planning work cannot be relaxed by even an
iota.''

<TEXT>
   The pilot of Avianca Flight 52 asked his
co-pilot if he had told the control tower that they had an
``emergency'' shortly before the jet crashed on Long Island, a
source close to the crash investigation said.
   Co-pilot Mauricio Klotz did not directly answer Capt. Laureano
Caviedes Hoyos' question, saying ``I told them we're low on fuel,''
the source, who asked not be identified, told The Associated Press.
   Investigators have pointed to the crew's use of the word
``priority,'' instead of ``emergency,'' in conversations with
controllers in explaining the handling of the Boeing 707.
   When a pilot declares a fuel ``emergency'' to controllers, the
plane is cleared to land immediately. That doesn't happen when the
word ``priority'' is used.
   Friday's disclosure was the first indication that a crew member
used the word ``emergency'' in describing their situation.
   Cockpit tapes show that the crew never told air traffic
controllers they had an emergency, investigators say.
   The plane glided powerless into a hillside on Long Island's
north shore Jan. 25, killing 73 of the 159 people aboard, including
the cockpit crew.
   The investigation has focused on the conversations between
controllers and crew in the final leg of its flight from Bogota and
Medellin, Colombia.
   After nearly an hour and a half of delays, the crew told
regional controllers the plane was low on fuel and needed priority
handling. The plane was then put in the hands of local controllers.
   The flight was handled in a routine manner on its first
approach, which was aborted in wind and fog. It was then told to
loop back over Long Island to try again _ another routine
direction, which was OK'd by the crew.
   It was during this loop that the engines quit and the plane
crashed.
   The cockpit conversations shifted back and forth between English
and Spanish, according to the source, who quoted an unofficial
translation.
   Less than five minutes after the missed approach, Caviedes, 56,
asked Klotz, ``Did you tell them we have an emergency?''
   Klotz, 28, replied: ``I told them we're low on fuel.''
   After the exchange, the talk turned to a brisk but businesslike
discuss of altitude, control positions and other normal landing
routine, the source said.
   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said he was not familiar with the internal cockpit
conversation and therefore could not comment on whether the pilot
used the word ``emergency.''

   More snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected from northern
Texas to New England this weekend as a slow-moving storm system
moved northeast from the southern Plains.
   Low pressure over the Texas panhandle extended to the
Mississippi Valley while cold high pressure over the Ontario-Quebec
border edged into the Northern Plains.
   Freezing rain has been a factor in 10 traffic deaths in Kansas
and Missouri since Thursday, and roads in both states continued to
be slick today.
   Missouri braced for another 2 to 4 inches of snow, perhaps mixed
with freezing rain or sleet, through Sunday morning.
   Up to 6 inches of snow was forecast across parts of central and
eastern Kansas by today.
   Snow fell at the rate of an inch per hour in some parts of New
York on Friday. About 6 inches fell in Syracuse, and 5.8 inches in
Buffalo was accompanied by an unexpected blast of cold air. Another
6 inches is possible by Sunday.
   Thunderstorms produced hail the size of marbles Friday evening
south of Rye, Ark.
   Chinook winds blowing at 30 to 50 mph caused travel problems
across north-central Montana by whipping up blowing, drifting snow,
and blizzard conditions prevailed in parts of the state.
   On the West Coast, a cold front moving inland was expected to
soak western Oregon into central California today.
   Cold, dry air from Canada should chill northern New England
temperatures to well below zero.
   The Southeast enjoyed record high temperatures for Groundhog Day
in Washington, D.C., with 72 degrees; Huntsville, Ala., 73;
Augusta, Ga., 79; Jackson, Miss., and Meridian, Miss., 81; and Fort
Myers, Fla., 88 _ the nation's high.

   Voters cast ballots today in an election
pitting Mayor Sidney Barthelemy against a challenger who has
accused him of race-baiting.
   Barthelemy, New Orleans' second black mayor, is running for a
second term. His main challenger is Donald Mintz, a white attorney
who wears a lapel button showing white and black hands interlinked.
   Mintz, 46, who left New Orleans' dock board to make his first
run for elective office, claimed Barthelemy's ads on a black radio
station appealed to anti-white racism.
   Barthelemy, 47, said it was Mintz who interjected the issue of
race during the campaign, which also included anonymous fliers
depicting Barthelemy as an opportunistic Uncle Tom.
   Barthelemy predicted that he will win by about 10 percentage
points _ slightly below the margin shown in recent polls.
   ``I think without question that the vast majority of black
voters are going to vote for me and the vast majority of white
voters are going to vote for Mintz,'' he said Friday. ``There'll be
some crossover. I think I'll get more crossover votes than he
will.''
   About 54.4 percent of the city's voters are black and 44.4
percent white, with Asians making up most of the rest.
   About 55 to 60 percent of the city's 237,342 voters are expected
to turn out for the election, said Registrar Louis Keller. The
ballot also includes races for five City Council seats and nine
other city offices.
   The low-key election campaign has been upstaged by the Christmas
holidays, the Sugar Bowl and the Super Bowl. Even the issue of
race, which sparked the two televised debates, did little to
enliven the campaign.
   Early polls put Mintz ahead of Barthelemy, even though Mintz has
no government experience. But Barthelemy, a former state senator
and city councilman, has drawn ahead by 10 to 12 percentage points
in recent polls.
   Also running are Herman J. ``Buster'' Bustamente and black
businessman Rudy E. Mills Sr., who are expected to draw few votes.
   If no candidate gets more than half the vote, a runoff will be
held March 3.

<DATELINE>ENTERPRISE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI shifted part of its
investigation of the mail bombings that killed a federal judge and
a civil rights attorney to an operator of a print shop and his wife.
   Blood, hair and saliva samples will be taken from Brian Joseph
Fleming and his wife, Georgia, their attorney said.
   The FBI seized documents filling nine boxes Friday at Fleming's
home, but his attorney, John Knowles, said they were ``nothing
really important'' to the mail bomb probe.
   ``No typewriters in the septic tank,'' the attorney said.
   In the last two weeks, agents have canvassed Enterprise, a
southeastern Alabama community of 18,000 residents, and the
surrounding area _ even digging up septic tanks _ for a typewriter
believed used by the bomber.
   Killed in the December bomb attacks were 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Savannah, Ga., attorney Robert
Robinson. No one has been charged in the case.
   Another 10 boxes of material were removed from Fleming's
business, the Printing Press, located across the street from the
FBI's temporary command post.
   Fleming, 32, just shrugged when asked why the agents wanted the
material. The agents maintained their silence on the case.
   Knowles said the government apparently was trying to link the
mail bomb case to Fleming's indictment on a charge of conspiring to
export firearms, reportedly to Northern Ireland.
   Fleming pleaded innocent to the gun exportation charge and is
free on $5,000 bond.
   The Fleming searches drew attention away from salvage dealer
Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, a part-time preacher who has been at the
center of the FBI investigation.
   Last month, O'Ferrell's home and business were subjected to
similar FBI searches.
   Doug Marshall, an FBI spokesman in Mobile, said the FBI would
continue to make Enterprise the base of its mail bomb investigation
for an indefinite time.
   Meanwhile, in Houston, an apparently unrelated mail bomb that
injured a pastor's daughter on Tuesday was mailed from
Elizabethtown, N.C., a federal postal inspector said.
   List Osteen, 31, suffered bruises and flash burns and was in
good condition Friday at Methodist Hospital in Houston.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state comptroller said the federal takeover of
Florida's largest thrift is in the taxpayers' best interests, but
some analysts say the government dragged its feet in seizing the
financially troubled CenTrust Bank.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision Friday
declared that the savings and loan was operating in an unsafe and
unsound condition and turned it over to the Resolution Trust Corp.
for sale or liquidation.
   The seizure, which had been imminent for some time, came as two
large savings institutions in Texas and California showed signs of
recovery with the help of federal subsidies.
   But two other Florida banks also were seized Friday.
   Federal investigators fanned out through Centrust's towering
Miami headquarters on Friday, making sure employees left the
building without taking any documents.
   CenTrust's offices remain open for business with deposits
guaranteed to $100,000 per account. The institution had $6.2
billion in 325,813 accounts and was not insolvent, federal
regulators said, but would soon be if changes were not made.
   CenTrust's failure was blamed on junk bond investing and lavish
spending on art, a company yacht and high salaries. Since December,
the thrift was losing an estimated $2 million a day, analysts said.
   ``The big question is why the OTC didn't act sooner,'' said
Miami thrift analyst Kenneth Thomas, who contended having seized
the bank in December would have saved taxpayers millions of dollars.
   ``It's inexcusable. Basically (CenTrust Chairman) David Paul
gouged his thumb into the (thrift office's) eye and kept it
there,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va.
   But thrift office enforcement director Rosemary Stewart said,
``We don't think this took long at all. ... Proof that this
institution was in serious enough financial condition to warrant a
takeover was just recently obtained.''
   A CenTrust spokesman did not immediately return telephone
messages seeking comment Friday and a man who answered a phone at
Paul's Miami Beach office also declined to comment.
   ``This is not an action you like to take, but it is one we
thought was in the best interests of the depositors and
taxpayers,'' said Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis, whose office
participated in Friday's action. ``This whole situation with the
thrift industry is one that has to be turned around.''
   Two banks seized by federal authorities indicated the industry
can prosper. The Bright Banc Savings Association of Dallas, one of
the nation's largest savings institutions, was sold for $48
million. And the American Savings Bank in California said it earned
$214.2 million in 1989.
   In separate actions Friday, federal regulators also seized
Pioneer Savings Bank in Clearwater, the state's 11th largest
thrift, with $2 billion in assets; and state regulators closed
Commerce Bank of Tampa, with $21 million in assets.
   CenTrust, with $8.2 billion in assets, is Florida's largest and
the nation's 23rd largest savings institution.
   The thrift office, in announcing the takeover, said that as of
Sept. 30 CenTrust was $245 million in the red.
   The agency also cited ``substantial dissipation of assets and
earnings due to violations ... (including) excessive and
inappropriate expenses and investments.''
   In December, the thrift office issued a ``cease and desist''
order instructing CenTrust to sell what was left of its $30 million
art collection, much of it displayed in Paul's home, plus
limousines, a corporate jet and a $233,000 company sailboat.

<TEXT>
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani says he
hopes to hear by Monday whether leftist guerillas will agree to
talks brokered by the United Nations aimed at settling El
Salvador's prolonged civil war.
   ``Our government is set on finding a political solution to the
conflict,'' Cristiani said Friday. ``There is no use for a military
solution. We are ready to sit down and discuss the incorporation of
the FMLN in the democratic process.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Friday that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III telephoned UN Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to express support for U.N. efforts
to restart negotiations.
   Cristiani, holding talks with U.S. officials in Washington, told
the National Press Club that de Cuellar told him Wednesday he would
immediately try to contact leftist FMLN rebels and get talks
started.
   Cristiani said he hoped there would be an answer from the rebels
by the time he returns to San Salvador on Monday.
   Ms. Tutwiler said President Bush and the secretary of state
discussed the issue with Cristiani on Thursday.
   ``The United States strongly supports President Cristiani's
efforts to enlist U.N. assistance in resuming negotiations,'' she
said.
   Cristiani also appealed in his speech for continued U.S. aid to
El Salvador.
   ``We believe for the first time in 10 years we have a great
possibility of finding a solution to the Salvadoran conflict,'' he
said. ``It would be a shame to give the extreme right and the
extreme left a negative sign. Any change in the status of aid would
be a negative sign.''
   U.S. economic aid to El Salvador in the current fiscal year was
cut by the Bush administration to $130.6 million from the previous
year's $185 million.
   The administration has requested an increase to $180 million in
economic aid to El Salvador for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   After leaving Washington, Cristiani made an unannounced visit to
Boston Friday night, where he was met by demonstrators protesting
the slaying of six Jesuit priests in his county last November,
according to a published report.
   David Voisin, a spokesman for Central American Solidarity
Association, told The Associated Press that Cristiani was planning
to meet with Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Boston, to try to smooth over strained relations between his
government and the church.
   However, Law's press secretary, Monsignor Timothy Moran, said
Cristiani had not contacted Law and no such meeting was scheduled.
   The Herald reported that a State Department spokesman would only
say that Cristiani was in Boston for a ``private visit.''
   Voisin said more protests were planned today.

<TEXT>
   A 2{-month trial has ended in guilty
verdicts for General Electric Co. and two employees accused of
bilking the government of $10 million on a battlefield computer
system.
   The verdict Friday raised the possibility GE could be suspended
from new Pentagon business, a step the government often takes
against contractors accused of wrongdoing.
   The jury found GE, the nation's second-largest defense
contractor, guilty of four counts of mail fraud and 282 counts of
making false claims. It was acquitted of one mail fraud count and
30 other false claim counts.
   Gerald A. Leo, former materials manager of GE subsidiary
Management and Technical Services Co., was convicted of four counts
of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive federal
investigators.
   James Badolato, former subcontracts manager for the subsidiary,
was convicted of one count of obstructing justice and one count of
trying to deceive investigators.
   Leo, 52, faces up to 25 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
Badolato, 43, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
Both men now work in other GE departments.
   Both men were acquitted on separate mail fraud and racketeering
charges.
   U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. allowed Leo and Badolato
to remain free on bail pending sentencing scheduled for April 10.
Attorneys for GE and Badolato said they would appeal. An attorney
for Leo declined to comment on an appeal.
   The case involved a $250 million contract to supply the Army
with an updated version of its Decentralized Automated Service
Support System computer, known as DAS-3. Prosecutors claimed Leo
and Badolato _ with the tacit consent of GE officials _ padded
costs and failed to notify the Pentagon of savings negotiated with
subcontractors.
   GE faces a fine of about $50 million, plus the costs of
prosecution, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Howard said. In
addition, the government has filed a $23 million civil suit against
GE, alleging overcharges and seeking damages.
   GE said in a statement from its Fairfield, Conn., headquarters
that its subsidiary had been ready since 1985 to settle the civil
case. The indictments were issued in November 1988.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist said the verdict
``sends a message that once a company engages in this kind of
conduct, merely opening up their wallet isn't enough.''
   But GE said the verdict ``stretches the theory of `vicarious
corporate liability' beyond reasonable limits.''
   Harbist said a decision on whether GE would be suspended from
Pentagon contracts would rest with the secretary of the Army.
   Badolato's attorney, Greg Miller, said he was shocked with the
verdict, but called his client's acquittal on racketeering charges
a victory.
   It was GE's second defense-related fraud case in four years.
   In May 1985, the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming
$800,000 in cost overruns on Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missiles and paid a $1.04 million fine.
   GE receives approximately $6 billion annually for defense
contracts ranging from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment
to highly classified strategic work.

   A survivor of the Avianca jet crash who
had swallowed packets of cocaine before boarding the flight may be
a hit man for the Medellin drug cartel, federal authorities said.
   FBI spokeswoman Lorraine Johnson said Friday the information on
Antonio Zuluaga, 46, came from the Colombian government. She said a
probe of the Colombian man would continue for several days.
   Zuluaga is being held on drug possession charges in the prison
ward of the Nassau County Medical Center, where he is listed in
satisfactory condition with back and arm injuries sustained in the
Jan. 25 crash of Avianca 52. The crash killed 73 people and left 85
injured.
   Zuluaga was arraigned at his bedside on Tuesday on charges of
criminal possession of a controlled substance, a charge punishable
by up to 25 years to life in prison, said Assistant District
Attorney Pamela Kelly-Pincus.
   Zuluaga has passed 29 condom-like bags containing eight ounces
of what he identified as cocaine, she said.
   Also Friday, a widowed mother of three filed a $40 million
lawsuit in New York City against Avianca for injuries she suffered
in the crash.
   Maria Elsa Amado Gonzalez, 41, said in court papers that both
her legs were broken, her right hip fractured and facial bones
cracked.
   She had to undergo skin grafts and cosmetic surgery and will
require more such operations in the future.
   On Tuesday, a man and his young son filed a $202.5 million
negligence suit against the airline, in what apparently was the
first lawsuit filed by survivors of the crash.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today chose a moderate
reformer as Bulgaria's new premier, a day after the ruling
Communist Party expelled much of its old guard and picked another
advocate of change as its leader.
   The new premier, Politburo member Andrei Lukanov, promised
immediate reforms in a speech after his unanimous election. The
opposition, however, continued to reject a Communist offer to join
a provisional government.
   On Friday, the Communist Party ended a watershed party congress
by electing Alexander Lilov, a Politburo member, as its new chief.
Lilov, 56, replaces Petar Mladenov, who will continue as president.
   Mladenov took over both jobs on Nov. 10 following the ouster of
hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov's after 35 years in power.
   The Communist-dominated government of former premier Georgi
Atanassov resigned late Thursday.
   It was not immediately clear which of the three leaders _ the
premier, the party chief or the president _ would have the most
substantive power in the new government.
   Lukanov, a 51-year-old economist who speaks several languages,
became the third moderate Communist reformer in the upper echelon
of the crisis-ridden party, which is struggling to remodel itself
under the wave of popular pressure for democratic reform that has
swept Eastern Europe.
   Lukanov and his reform-minded colleagues face public skepticism
about their commitment to reform the party and the nation, as well
as their ability to handle a flagging economy hobbled by
unprecedented labor unrest.
   ``We have to make fundamental economic reforms, and we have to
do them immediately,'' Lukanov told Parliament in his address today.
   He said he would present new ministers for his government on
Thursday and prepare an ``anti-crisis program'' for social and
economic problems by Feb. 28.
   During the party congress, the Communist Central Committee was
replaced by a 153-member Supreme Council less than half its size.
The new policy-making body contains a much broader political
spectrum, including radical pro-reform factions.
   Ninety percent of the Central Committee members failed to win
election to the new council, party sources said.
   At a joint news conference Friday with Lukanov, Lilov told
reporters that consultations would start today with ``other parties
and groups for setting up a government of national concord.''
   His comment was a renewed offer for the opposition to enter into
an accord to set up a new government to rule until multiparty
elections set for May.
   Petar Beron, a senior member of both the Ecoglasnost
environmentalist group and the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces, described Lukanov today as ``very capable and resourceful.''
   But he repeated the opposition's refusal to take part in a
provisional government.
   Beron said there was little point in taking part because the
Communists dominate Parliament anyway.
   On Friday, Beron also appeared to reject, at least for now,
multiparty elections in May. Opposition activists say they need
more time to prepare.
   Beron said he could envisage elections under international
supervision, possibly by the United Nations.
   Also Friday, state radio and television reported that Zhivkov,
who was earlier reported under arrest, has been transferred to an
undisclosed hospital for an unspecified illness.
   Television quoted his doctors as saying Friday he could not be
held further under arrest at the Central Investigation Center in
Sofia.
   Television also announced that the Bulgarian attorney general
was appealing to Western European countries to establish whether
there are accounts under Zhivkov's name or those of his relatives
in their banks. The attorney general wants such funds impounded.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two guerrillas
in a pre-dawn clash in southern Lebanon today, an army spokesman
said.
   The Israeli force suffered no casualties, the army said.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, based in Sidon, Lebanon, said a
three-man guerrilla squad ``from the front's heroes'' clashed with
an Israeli patrol in Ein Ebl on the northern edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone.
   The group, led by terrorist mastermind Mohammed Abbas, better
known as Abul Abbas, said one of its guerrillas returned to his
base wounded. It did not say what happened to the other two
fighters.
   The statement claimed the guerrillas killed or wounded several
Israeli soldiers and destroyed an armored vehicle.
   An Israeli military spokesman said the soldiers were on patrol
when they spotted a group of guerrillas southeast of the village of
Rashaf, four miles north of the Israeli border, and opened fire,
killing two.
   The guerrillas were armed with Soviet-made, RPG-7 grenade
launchers and assault rifles, the military said. The army said it
was unclear to which organization the guerrillas were tied.
   The clash took place in the area of Israel's self-declared
security zone, a six-to-10-mile wide strip of land patrolled by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia and the Israeli army. The
security zone was carved out in 1985 when Israel withdrew most of
its forces from Lebanon, ending its three year occupation of the
southern part of that country.
   The last incident in the tense security zone was on Jan. 26,
when three Israeli soldiers were wounded in two separate mine
blasts.
   On Jan. 22, troops shot and killed two Palestinian guerrillas
who killed an Israeli colonel a day earlier in what was the first
attempt this year to infiltrate into Israel from South Lebanon,
army officials said.

<DATELINE>DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said today he is certain that East Germans will vote in favor of
reuniting with West Germany, but he hinted that a neutral new
Germany could be dangerous.
   Kohl sought to defuse recent Soviet worries about the revival of
a strong Germany. He reiterated that a united Germany should be
achieved within ``security structures in Europe spanning both
alliances,'' at lower levels of armament.
   East German Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Thursday offered a
four-point plan for a united but militarily neutral Germany. Bonn
immediately rejected the neutrality idea.
   Kohl and Modrow planned to meet later today at Davos for talks
expected to focus on the continuing domestic crisis in East Germany.
   In a speech to a privately sponsored meeting of business
executives and statesmen, Kohl said the continuation of Eastern
Europe's reform drive, particularly in East Germany, is
indispensable for European stability.
   ``Every successful reform in a country is a step toward more
stability in all of Europe,'' he told the annual World Economic
Forum in this Swiss resort.
   Kohl said the Western military alliance, while it must adapt to
changes in the Warsaw Pact, ``remains indispensable.''
   ``This includes also in future a substantial security role for
the United States on our continent,'' he said.
   The goal of unity ``corresponds to the wishes and hopes of an
overwhelming majority of all Germans,'' Kohl said, adding that West
Germany will respect the decision of East Germans in any referendum
on unification.
   ``But I have no doubt what it will be,'' he said.
   Yet Kohl also said, ``The Germans do not want to go their own,
nationalistic way.''
   ``That is why I am also strictly against the idea of German
neutrality. Such a proposal is contrary to the logic of the process
of pan-European unification,'' he said.
   ``A united Germany in the heart of Europe should not have any
special status which would isolate it,'' he added. He was
apparently referring to the disastrous attempt by other European
powers to rein in Germany after World War I.
   Kohl also said there could be no firm timetable for unification.
   He said his 10-point plan for eventual German unity, advanced
last fall, respects ``legitimate security interests of all
participants in East and West, not least of the Soviet Union.''
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
in an interview published Friday that the issue of German
reunification be put to an international referendum because the
world suffered so much at the hands of the Nazis.

   Five ethnic Albanian groups appealed
to Yugoslavia's leaders today to open a dialogue with them in the
troubled southern province of Kosovo.
   Thousands of police backed by tanks and planes patrolled the
province, where 21 people have been killed in clashes with police
in the past 11 days. No new demonstrations were reported.
   In an English-language statement, the five groups said they
supported the government's attempt to resolve the unrest and asked
for talks.
   The statement urged the government to investigate reports that
police fired without cause or warning several times in the past
week, killing people in several villages.
   It said authorities used ``classic forms of state terrorism'' to
put down ethnic Albanian calls for greater autonomy from
Yugoslavia's largest republic, Serbia, which has administrative
control over Kosovo.
   It demanded ``an immediate ban on the use of lethal firearms by
police, establishing a commission to investigate all alleged
murders as a way to defuse the explosive situation that threatens
to turn into a bloody civil war.''
   Serbian authorities claim the ethnic Albanian majority is
harassing the Serb minority population in Kosovo and that the
republic must retain control over the province. They claim that the
ultimate goal of ethnic Albanian ``separatists'' is to secede from
Yugoslavia and join neighboring Albania.
   Yugoslavia's liberal northern regions of Slovenia and Croatia
have backed ethnic Albanian calls for greater self-government and
blamed the unrest on Serbian moves, backed by nationalist Serbian
leader Sloboban Milosevic, to reduce the province's autonomy.
   On Friday, President Janez Drnovsek appealed to ethnic Albanians
and Serbs in the province to stop the violence, which he said
threatened the process of economic and political reform nationwide.
   The government has pledged to allow a multiparty democracy and
observe human rights according to internationally recognized
standards.
   Drnovsek has said that the use of arms is in no group's interest
and has repeatedly called for a dialogue.
   But officials of Serbia have demanded that opposition leaders
first renounce their alleged separatist plans before any dialogue
can be expected.
   The groups who made the statement were the Kosovo branch of the
Yugoslav Union for Democratic Initiative, the Committee for Human
Rights and Freedoms, the Democratic League of Kosova, the Society
of Philosophers and Sociologists of Kosova, and the Initiating
Board for the Youth Parliament. Kosova is the name Albanians use to
refer to the province.

   The Soviet foreign minister has proposed that the
issue of German reunification be put to an international referendum
because the world suffered so much at the hands of the Nazis.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in an interview published Friday, said
Europe must be assured that another militaristic regime will not
arise.
   ``It is not the idea of German unity itself but the revival of
sinister shadows of the past associated with it, as well as a
possible growth of militarism, that are met with apprehension in
the world,'' Shevardnadze told a group of Soviet reporters,
according to Tass, the official news agency.
   ``It's necessary to find a method of sounding out public opinion
in the most democratic and open way possible, say through an
all-European referendum with the participation of the U.S.A. and
Canada, or at least through wide parliamentary discussions,'' the
foreign minister said.
   In Davos, Switzerland today, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he is certain that East Germans will vote in favor of
reuniting with West Germany, but he hinted that a neutral new
Germany could be dangerous.
   He also sought to defuse Soviet worries about the revival of a
strong Germany, while at the same time saying he opposes making a
united Germany neutral.
   ``The Germans do not want to go their own, nationalistic way,''
he said.
   While giving the strongest Kremlin endorsement yet of a united
Germany, Shevardnadze repeated long-standing Soviet conditions that
the process not happen too quickly or cause instability in Europe.
   ``We wish the movement of Germans toward a united motherland to
develop without upheavals, not to upset the European and world
balance and not to create a threat to their neighbors,'' he said.
   Tass did not say when the interview took place, but
Shevardnadze's comments responded to an outline offered Thursday by
East German Premier Hans Modrow on how a single German state should
be attained.
   Modrow called for a militarily neutral ``united fatherland''
with Berlin as its capital.
   While Shevardnadze generally supported Modrow's plan and
endorsed the idea of neutrality, he said the issue was too
important for politicians alone to decide.
   ``It's important that not only the politicians but the peoples
as well decide the fate and the future of Europe,'' he said.
   Suggesting a say for third parties appeared to conflict with
Shevardnadze's stated support for self-determination for East and
West Germany.
   In the Kremlin's clearest endorsement of reunification, he told
the interviewers: ``We favor the eventual creation of a united,
peaceful, democratic Germany.''
   The Soviet Union has traditionally opposed a single Germany, but
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev softened that position with a
hands-off policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
   Shevardnadze said the suffering of World War II, in which 20
million Soviets were killed, meant ``all peoples, especially the
peoples of the Soviet Union, should have the right to a guarantee
that there will never again be a threat of war from German land.''
   ``They will accept and support German unity only if they are
sure of this,'' he told Soviet journalists.
   Third countries also must have pledges that the Germans will
``recognize unconditionally and strictly observe'' borders in
Europe formed after World War II and not make territorial claims,
he said.
   Gorbachev met Friday with Gregor Gysi, chief of the East German
Communist Party. Gysi told reporters afterward they agreed that any
reunification must not threaten stability in Europe and ``only time
will give the answers'' to how it can be achieved.
   In Washington, visiting West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Friday he and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III had agreed that German reunification would not mean
extending NATO's military area eastward.

   The newly legalized African National
Congress called a meeting of its senior leaders Saturday to begin
reviewing strategy in light of the dramatic policy changes in South
Africa.
   ANC Secretary-General Alfred Nzo and Joe Slovo, head of the
South African Communist Party, flew into Stockholm late Friday to
join Walter Sisulu and other ANC veterans touring Scandinavia after
their release from prison in October.
   The meeting was described as a session of the executive
committee of the ANC, the largest movement opposing South Africa's
apartheid system of legalized racial discrimination.
   ``The ANC will discuss new strategies because of the new
situation which has arisen,'' said David Kgabang, an official of
the ANC's Stockholm office.
   President F.W. de Klerk told the South African Parliament in
Cape Town Friday that the government was lifting the 30-year ban on
the ANC and about 60 other opposition groups, and promised to
unconditionally free ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, was jailed
in 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan the start
of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign against the white-run
government.
   De Klerk also rescinded most emergency regulations imposed in
1986 to quell anti-government uprisings, and declared a moratorium
on executions.
   In a statement drafted in Stockholm Friday, the ANC gave a
cautious welcome to the speech, but voiced concern that some
emergency restrictions remained in place, including the power to
detain without trial. It called for the continued international
isolation of South Africa until apartheid is dismantled.
   ``Victory is in sight,'' said Sisulu, but he added that the
measures were only a preliminary step toward creating the conditons
for negotiations.
   Kgabang said he expected the ANC to reopen its offices in
Johannesburg and elsewhere in South Africa. The group operated
openly for 48 years until it was outlawed in 1960, and launched a
campaign of sabotage the following year.
   The arrival of Nzo and Slovo brought together in Sweden most of
the ANC's top decision makers. Nzo is the group's acting president
in place of Oliver Tambo, who is recuperating from a stroke in a
Stockholm clinic. Slovo is a former head of the ANC's armed wing.
   They joined Thabo Mbeki, who is in charge of the ANC's foreign
relations, Sisulu and five other recently freed leaders from the
Mandela era.
   ``This is an opportunity to discuss developments with the
leadership which has been in the cold for so many years,'' Kgabang
told The Associated Press.
   Meetings were expected to last until Monday, when Sisulu and the
other released veterans planned to return to South Africa while the
rest head back to the ANC's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The ANC said in its statement Friday that it would consult with
the Mass Democratic Movement, the main alliance of anti-apartheid
groups. ``The review of the new situation will include an
assessment of the prospects of genuine negotiations to end the
apartheid system,'' it said.

<HEAD>Report Says Party to Consider Shedding Guarantee of Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party will consider shedding its
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in Soviet society at a key
Central Committee meeting next week, a published report said today.
   The Soviet Union, ruled exclusively by the Communists since a
few months after the 1917 Russian Revolution, is the last remaining
Warsaw Pact nation to give the Communists a guaranteed monopoly on
power.
   A draft platform to be presented at the Central Committee
meeting on Monday and Tuesday calls for the party to ``fight for
its leading role, but assume no state or government powers, nor lay
any claim to having its role set down in the Constitution,'' said
Interfax, a news service of official Radio Moscow.
   Interfax did not say how it obtained its information on the
platform that party leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev apparently will
present Monday as a basis for preparing the party's next Congress,
scheduled for October. The Central Committee meeting is widely
expected to turn into a crucial political battle between party
reformers and hard-liners.
   In addition, it is likely to be the hard-liners' last chance to
make a power play before the voters decide on their future in local
and republic-level elections in February and March.
   Communist Party officials have said Gorbachev would present a
program to the two-day session calling for a ``radical
democratization'' of the party.
   A group of reform-minded deputies calling itself the Democratic
Platform also has drafted an alternate program for the party
calling for a multiparty system and a virtual apology for decades
of strict one-party rule.
   Members of the Democratic Platform group have said they would
try to have their program introduced at the Central Committee
meeting as an alternative.
   The leading role of the Communist Party, written into the Soviet
Constitution under former President Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1977, has
come under increasing attack in recent months. The Lithuanian
republic already has struck that reference from its constitution as
it prepares to legalize other parties.
   Reformers tried to have the issue brought before the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies at its December meeting,
but they were defeated by a margin of about 300 votes.
   Gorbachev, in a visit to Lithuania less than a month ago, tried
to persuade Lithuanian Communists to heal their split with the
national party that they declared in December.
   But he added that he saw ``no tragedy'' if a multiparty system
evolves. Nevertheless, Gorbachev continues to insist that a
multiparty system also is ``no panacea'' for all the country's
troubles.
   The Demcratic Platform is considering declaring that the
Communist Party cannot be reformed and breaking away to form a
social democratic party if the Communists refuse to embark on
radical reforms.
   Interfax said the draft ``recognizes the right to platforms
inside the party and the right of a minority to defend its views.
However, the party will not permit factions with an internal
organization or discipline of their own.''
   The report also said new party structures would be proposed. The
Central Committee, cut from more than 300 members to 251 at a
meeting last year, would be reduced to 200, it said.
   The party would have a chairman and two deputy chairmen, and a
new structure called the Political Executive Committee would be
formed and include representatives of all 15 Soviet republics. It
was unclear whether the Executive Committee would replace the
current Politburo, the ruling force of the party and of Soviet
society as a whole.

<HEAD>Militants Enforce Strike As Curfew Lifted in Kashmir</HEAD>

   The government today lifted curfew for
several hours, but shops remained closed because of a strike called
by Moslem militants leading a secessionist campaign in
Jammu-Kashmir state, witnesses said.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front spread the strike call by
word of mouth on Friday night and early today, local journalists
said, quoting shopkeepers in downtown Srinagar and its suburbs.
   The front is spearheading the four-decade-old campaign for
secession of Jammu-Kashmir state's predominantly Moslem Kashmir
region.
   At least 76 people have been killed since the government began
cracking down on the increasingly violent secessionist movement
Jan. 20.
   Most of those killed during the crackdown were curfew-breaking
militants shot by the security forces.
   The government reported no deaths between Jan. 25 and Friday,
when at least four people were killed.
   Three of them died when police opened fire on a mob defying
curfew in neighboring Sopore, police said. The fourth was a Hindu
shopkeeper who was shot by the militants, according to Gov.
Jagmohan, who uses only one name.
   Today's strike in Srinagar was to protest the Sopore deaths,
Kaiser Mirza, a local journalist, quoted the shopkeepers as saying.
The curfew relaxation began at 5 a.m. and was scheduled to end at 5
p.m.
   Mirza said most shops did not open in the morning when curfew
was lifted and a few shops that did open soon put down their
shutters when owners learned of the general strike call.
   It was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing
attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause.
   During earlier curfew relaxations, which began one week ago,
vegetable shops and groceries were crowded and streets were filled
with people and traffic. This morning, small groups of men stood at
the street corners but little traffic moved on the streets, Mirza
said.
   The Moslem militancy dates back to 1948 when the Hindu maharajah
of mostly Moslem Jammu-Kashmir opted for union with predominantly
Hindu India.
   Pakistan, born out of a 1947 division of the Indian
subcontinent, objected saying a Moslem area should go to
predominantly Moslem Pakistan.
   Two wars over Kashmir left a slice of the old royal state under
Pakistani control, while the rest remained part of India's
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Jammu-Kashmir, with 64 percent of its 5 million people following
Islam, is the only Moslem majority area among India's 25 states.
Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of the 880 million
population.
   Kashmiri militants at first demanded union with Pakistan but
have recently campaigned for a separate neutral country which if
formed would nestle between India, Pakistan and China.

   Intelligence agents today arrested
another renegade officer involved in December's failed coup
attempt, the military said.
   Navy Capt. Proceso Maligalig was intercepted by government
soldiers as he drove his car through a residential district of
Manila, said Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao, chief of the military's
Criminal Investigation Service.
   Maligalig, 46, had disguised himself with a wig and a pair of
thick-rimmed glasses, Dumlao said. Maligalig was unarmed and did
not resist arrest.
   Authorities had issued a $22,300 reward for his capture.
   Maligalig, a bomb expert, is believed to be a security aide of
Commodore Domingo Calajate, former chief of the military's
logistics command. Maligalig and Calajate both defected to the
rebels on the first day of the Dec. 1-9 failed coup, Dumlao said.
   Maligalig, presented to reporters hours after his arrest, denied
being a ring leader of the December coup. He said his troops simply
fought back when government troops attacked the logistics command.
   ``It was a sudden decision on our part,'' Maligalig said. ``I
have no prior knowledge of the coup plot.''
   ``We thought our lives were in jeopardy,'' he said. He said he
and Calajate, who remains at large, decided to abandon their troops
during the attack for fear of their own lives.
   Maligalig said he is a member of the Reform the Armed Forces
Movement, which launched the February 1986 popular rebellion that
ousted President Ferdinand Marcos and installed Corazon Aquino as
president.
   The movement has launched several coup attempts since then,
accusing Mrs. Aquino's government of the kind of corruption and
nepotism common in Marcos' 20-year rule.
   The December coup, which left at least 115 people dead and more
than 660 wounded, was the sixth and most serious attempt to topple
Mrs. Aquino.

   China today protested a visit to Czechoslovakia
by the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and Beijing
retaliated by postponing the visit of a Czechoslovak minister.
   The Dalai Lama, who received the Nobel Peace Prize last year,
has championed Tibetan autonomy. Chinese diplomats in Prague
earlier criticized his visit as an indication of political support
for separatism in Tibet, which is ruled by Communist China.
   Czechoslovakia's ambassador to China, Eduard Saul, was summoned
to the Foreign Ministry today and told the Dalai Lama's visit
``constitutes a gross interference in China's internal affairs,''
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Saul also was told that China is postponing a visit by
Czechoslovakia's minister of metallurgy, engineering and the
electrotechnical industry, scheduled to begin Feb. 17, Xinhua said.
   The Dalai Lama was invited by Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist
president, Vaclav Havel, for a four-day private visit that began
Friday.
   The Tibetan religious leader talked to reporters today but did
not address the Chinese protest directly. He said he was pleased to
visit Czechoslovakia following its peaceful, pro-democratcy
uprising in November that ousted its hard-line Communist leadership.
   He said only time will tell whether the Chinese government will
change, and he appeared to urge other countries to take a firm
stand with the Beijing leadership.
   ``Our experience is that when somebody tries to appease them
they get bolder and bolder. But if you stand firm, they show more
compliance,'' he said.
   The Buddhist monk is to spend Sunday in ``spiritual
consultations and meditations'' with Havel.
   Havel said Monday he had told China's ambassador to
Czechoslovakia that the Dalai Lama's visit was personal.
   ``I wanted to meet with him a long time ago when I was not yet a
president. I want to meditate with him,'' the Czechoslovak leader
said. ``If the Chinese republic is not satisfied with this
explanation, I am sorry.''
   Havel, a playwright and former dissident, became president last
month in the culmination of Czechoslovakia's revolution.
   China says Tibet has been part of China for 700 years and
accuses the Dalai Lama of instigating pro-independence violence
that has hit the Tibetan capital of Lhasa repeatedly in the past
two years. Lhasa remains under martial law imposed nearly a year
ago after a round of anti-Chinese rioting.
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959.

   Anti-apartheid activists long
banned from public comment spoke out freely today as the government
put into effect sweeping political reforms announced a day earlier
by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Thousands of blacks celebrated the changes at a stadium at
Alexandra, a black township near Johannesburg, chanting ``Viva
ANC!'' and swaying to the rhythm of freedom songs. Blacks also
celebrated in Cape Town and in the Natal provincial capital of
Pietermaritzburg.
   The day before, de Klerk legalized the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting white rule, and lifted
restrictions on 60 opposition groups and 374 individuals.
   For the first time in three decades, Helen Joseph, a friend of
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela and the first white person ever
placed under house arrest for anti-government activity, was quoted
by newspapers.
   ``This is a wonderful day. I am very excited about my personal
freedom since I am no longer a listed person,'' Ms. Joseph, 84, was
quoted as saying by The Star in Johnannesburg. ``Above all I am
excited about the return of all my friends and comrades and all the
exiles who will be coming back home, all my comrades who will be
released from jail.''
   In his speech, de Klerk also promised to release Mandela, the
jailed leader of the ANC. But de Klerk did not say when.
   In addition, the president placed a moratorium on executions and
partially lifted emergency restrictions on the news media. Police
still will retain control over photography or the filming of
political unrest and police action.
   De Klerk's announcements Friday met most of the conditions set
by the ANC to begin negotiations on a new constitution to bring the
black majority into the nation's political life. However, many
activists said the government must go further and dismantle
apartheid, under which the 28-million black majority has no say in
national affairs.
   The concessions announced by de Klerk will help efforts to end
an international sports boycott on South Africa, Johan du Plessis,
chairman of the South African National Olympic Committee, said
today. ``A lot more people will listen to what we have to say
now,'' he said.
   Blacks have repeatedly demonstrated against a British cricket
teams that is touring South Africa in defiance of the international
ban on sports teams competing here. Today, 7,000 people gathered
outside a cricket stadium in Pietermaritzburg to protest the team.
English captain Mike Gatting walked out to a truck where protest
leaders handed him a petition. Members of the crowd hurled stones
and insults as he left, but no injuries were reported.
   Notices were published today in the Government Gazette making
official the lifting of 30-year-old bans on the ANC, the
Pan-Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party and
other organizations.
   ANC leaders have been cautious about an invitation by de Klerk
for exiled black activists to return home. Even with the groups
legalized, they say there are many security laws and emergency
regulations in effect that could be used to arrest leaders of the
ANC and other groups.
   The government repealed laws that banned 175 people, including
ANC President Oliver Tambo, now recovering from a stroke in Sweden;
and the ANC's chief spokesman, Tom Sebina; the leader of the South
African Communist Party.
   It removed state-of-emergency prohibitions on travel and public
speaking on another 200 people.
   The Citizen, a pro-grovernment newspaper, said if the atmosphere
remained calm, the 71-year-old Mandela might be freed by next
weekend.
   De Klerk had said concerns about Mandela's safety and other
issues would delay his release from a life prison term for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the white-run government.
   ``The state president is very fluid and moves very fast. Judging
by his speech in parliament, Mr. Mandela's release could happen any
day now,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified government source
as saying.
   On Friday, the Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called de Klerk's speech ``incredible.''
   ``What he said has certainly taken my breath away,'' Tutu said.
``We could say that we are probably seeing history in the making in
South Africa.''
   The exiled ANC said de Klerk's announcements ``go a long way to
creating the climate conducive to negotiations.'' But the
Zambia-based group said more changes are needed before talks could
begin.
   The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of non-violent
campaigning for black rights. In 1961, it launched a guerrilla war.
   The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a
one-person, one-vote democracy, which de Klerk opposes, saying it
will result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5 million
whites.
   De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions
some type of system in which no single racial group would dominate.

   Surgeons have implanted into a human an
experimental device consisting of a slender bundle of fibers that
works like a lung in bringing oxygen to the heart, LDS Hospital
said.
   The device, the IntraVascular Oxygenator, or IVOX, is not a lung
replacement but a temporary mechanism to give patients with lung
damage time to heal. The Food and Drug Administration has approved
its use for up to seven days.
   The Salt Lake Tribune said the hospital is apparently the first
to insert the device.
   Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Friday that the two-hour
procedure had taken place that afternoon. He said he could not
confirm the age, sex or condition of the patient in accordance with
the wishes of the patient's family.
   The Tribune, quoting an unidentified hospital source, reported
today that the recipient is a 16-year-old girl.
   Dr. Roger C. Millar performed the operation, which involved
inserting the device _ a long bundle of tubes as thin as hairs _
into the inferior vena cava, the large vein that brings blood to
the heart from the body.
   In September, the FDA granted approval for limited testing of
the device.
   The device consists of hollow fibers through which oxygen is
delivered and carbon dioxide removed. Two intravenous tubes
attached to the bundle leave the body, one to deliver oyxgen, the
other to remove carbon dioxide.
   Developers of the device say it could help patients recover from
acute respiratory failure caused by inhalation of smoke or other
noxious fumes or by drugs, severe pneumonia and scores of other
ailments.
   The only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an
extracorporeal oxygenator, a large machine that requires pumping
the blood outside the body.
   Dr. J.D. Mortensen, the device's inventor, said the device
performs much like the natural membranes in the air sacs in the
human lung.
   The developer of the new device, CardioPulmonics Inc., a Salt
Lake City biomedical technology company, announced Jan. 11 that the
IVOX would be tested in 10 patients at four U.S. medical centers.
   Other centers approved to use the IVOX are Penn State's Hershey
Medical Center, the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann
Arbor, and the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California
Medical Center.
   The IVOX is to be tested on patients with acute respiratory
failure who have little chance of survival using previous treatment
methods.
   Madden said doctors at LDS Hospital and the Hershey Medical
Center have been evaluating patients who might qualify for the
first clinical trials. Several centers in Europe and Japan also
have been selected to try the procedure.
   The product was the outcome of membrane technology that makes
much higher concentrations of oxygen available using polypropylene
tubes the width of a hair.
   The temporary artificial lung is threaded through a vein in the
leg or neck into the body's main vein and can be removed the same
way. It has been tested on dogs and sheep.
   A spokesman at CardioPulmonics said Friday he had been asked not
to comment on the medical procedure.

   Rival Christian forces fought with tanks
and gunboats for a fifth day today, violating a Vatican-brokered
truce after just three hours. Shellfire killed 25 people and
trapped 500,000 in shelters.
   The renewed artillery barrage caught unprotected civilians who
had emerged from shelters to inspect damage inflicted on their
property in Moslem west Beirut and the city's eastern Christian
sector.
   It was the sixth failed attempt to stop the fighting between
Gen. Michel Aoun's army and the Lebanese Forces militia for control
of Lebanon's Christian enclave. The Lebanese Forces, led by Samir
Geagea, is the main Christian militia.
   Aoun and Geagea had announced they accepted a cease-fire called
by the Vatican through papal Nuncio Pablo Puente and Maronite
Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
community.
   Aoun and Geagea belong to that sect.
   The big guns fell silent shortly after the 1:15 p.m. deadline,
but shellfire resumed three hours later, with about six shells
falling every minute, a police spokesman said.
   It was not immediately clear who had broken the cease-fire.
   Geagea said in an interview broadcast live by the Christian
Voice of Lebanon radio that his militia was ``fully abiding'' by
the cease-fire.
   Aoun's command, in a statement broadcast by his Radio Lebanon,
said the general's positions were being shelled. The short
statement did not elaborate.
   No clear victor emerged from the earlier fighting, which sent
shells crashing into high-rise apartment buildings, schools,
hospitals, power plants, water pumping stations and fuel tanks.
   Police said 25 more people were killed overnight and 70 wounded,
bringing the overall toll to at least 152 dead and 586 wounded in
the showdown between the rival militias. Casualty figures from the
latest fighting were not immediately available.
   Fires burned out of control earlier today, as snipers kept
firefighters from battling the blazes. Police appealed to civil
defense squads to race to the rescue of trapped tenants in three
burning apartment buildings in East Beirut's main residential
district of Ashrafiyeh.
   The Lebanese Forces claimed it had brought most of Christian
east Beirut under its control with a mass defection by enemy
soldiers at Beirut's port and along half the city's three-mile
dividing Green Line.
   ``This brought the bulk of east Beirut under Lebanese Forces
control,'' the statement claimed. It did not say how many soldiers
had defected.
   If the claim is accurate, Aoun's forces would have lost their
only sea outlet for replenishing supplies, the Beirut harbor.
   Aoun denied the claim. In a statement, he said Lebanese Forces
militiamen ``shot the soldiers in the back'' while they defended
the Green Line.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
   Police said at least half of the Christian enclave's 1 million
people had been huddled in basements and bomb shelters before the
cease-fire today, with rapidly dwindling food and water and no
lights.
   The warring forces had ignored earlier appeals by the
International Red Cross for a humanitarian cease-fire to allow
evacuation of casualties on the streets and to send food to trapped
residents. Hospitals appealed for blood, plasma, oxygen and water
supplies.
   Aoun, 54, insists on disbanding the 6,000-member Lebanese Forces
to strengthen his hold on the Christian enclave. But Geagea, 40,
has vowed to fight to the death to defend the militia that has
borne the brunt of the fighting against the Moslems in Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun, who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to
command of about 20,000 soldiers, attacked Tuesday to gain full
control of the enclave north and east of Beirut.
   Aoun was fired by President Elias Hrawi, who was elected in
November under the terms of a peace plan brokered by the Arab
League. The plan was aimed at increasing political power of the
Moslem majority and ending the civil war, which has left 150,000
people dead.
   Aoun complains that the plan, approved by Parliament in October,
provides no fixed withdrawal timetable for Syria's estimated 40,000
troops. They came in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, but Aoun says they are simply fighting as an ally of
Moslem militias.
   Geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord, but he
has recognized Hrawi as president. Syria, the United States, and
much of the international community also recognize Hrawi's
government.

   Armed men on Saturday stole two bazookas
from a display at the War Museum, and the Defense Ministry said the
old weapons could be made to fire.
   No group claimed responsibility for the robbery.
   Witnesses told police that five men wielding pistols entered the
museum at 9:45 a.m., keeping guards at bay while grabbing the
bazookas. All five fled in a waiting car, one witness reported.
   The ministry announcement said that the bazookas ``with slight
modificiations and the addition of a few spare parts'' could be
made to work. It did not say where the weapons had been made, but
most equipment used by the army is supplied by the United States.

   Police have detained two journalists, and
a government newspaper said it might have been because of questions
they asked Zambia's president.
   Festo Ebongu, a New Vision reporter and stringer for the BBC,
and Alfred Okware, an associate editor of the magazine Newsdesk,
were picked up by police Friday.
   Both apparently were still being held Saturday, but police
declined comment on the case and it was not known if charges had
been filed.
   New Vision, a government-owned paper, said the arrests may have
been in connection with a news conference Monday when Okware and
Ebongu were among reporters who intensively questioned Kenneth
Kuanda, the Zambian president, at the end of a four-day state visit.
   Okware asked Kuanda why after 25 years in office he has not
considered relinquishing power.
   Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, immediately intervened and
told Kuanda not to waste his time answering the question.

<HEAD>Meditation Lengthens Lives of Elderly, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly people who were taught Transcendental
Meditation lived longer than their peers in a new study that
experts called the first direct scientific evidence that meditation
can prolong life.
   The technique worked better than two others for lowering blood
pressure and improving several aspects of mental function as well
as extending lifespan, researchers reported.
   ``It's a rather dramatic finding,'' said psychologist Arthur
Aron of the University of California at Santa Cruz, who was
familiar with the work. ``I think it's very impressive.''
   Two other psychologists who study meditation said they suspect
the outcome was due to factors other than Transcendental Meditation
itself. They also suggested that other techniques might do as well
or better.
   The work, done at Harvard University, is presented in the
December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
which is published by the American Psychological Association.
   The study included 73 volunteers, with an average age of 81,
from eight homes for the elderly. They were assigned randomly to
learn Transcendental Meditation, another technique called
mindfulness training, a simple relaxation program, or no training
at all.
   Three years later, all 20 of those taught Transcendental
Meditation were still alive. Survival rates in the other groups
were 88 percent, 65 percent and 77 percent, respectively.
   Transcendental Meditation, or TM, was taught in the 1960s and
'70s by the Indian Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles and
other celebrities.
   TM induces a ``a distinctively deep state of rest'' while the
mind is alert but ``in a very settled, quiet state,'' said study
co-author Charles Alexander, now an associate professor of
psychology at Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa.
   Students there practice TM as part of the curriculum, Alexander
said.
   The mindfulness training used in the study was not the Buddhist
technique of the same name. Instead, it was designed to stimulate
creation of ideas or new perspectives through a verbal exercise and
a challenge to think about topics in new and creative ways.
   Each technique was practiced for 20 minutes twice daily with the
eyes closed during the 12-week experiment.
   Alexander attributed the study's outcome to TM's combination of
high wakefulness, which he said combats atrophy of the mind and so
the body, and deep restfulness, which he said releases stress from
the nervous system and leads to reduced ``wear and tear'' on mind
and body.
   He said the study suggests TM should be combined with standard
Western medicine, not replace it.
   Some other meditation researchers suggested different
explanations for the outcome.
   Michael Maliszewski, director of behavioral medicine at the
Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago, said TM instructors may have
differed from the instructors of the other techniques in terms of
motivation or other factors that could have given their teachings
more impact. The TM group had fewer dropouts than the other groups,
he noted.
   He also said he suspected that Chinese Taoist meditative
techniques, which he said were designed to increase longevity,
might do so better than TM. Taoism has not been studied
experimentally so far, he said.
   Alexander replied that a survey covering most dropouts found
their decision had nothing to do with the quality of the
instructors. He also said other studies have found TM superior to
alternative techniques in improving aspects of physical and mental
health, even though the commitment of the instructors of other
techniques was presumeably as high as that of the TM instructors.
   Jonathan C. Smith, director of the Roosevelt University Stress
Institute in Chicago, said the result could have come from
combining relaxation with the idea of connecting to something
larger than oneself, TM's notion of a consciousness underlying all
beings. Any relaxation technique with what he called such religious
undercurrents might have done as well, he said.
   Alexander said instructors for each of the techniques strongly
downplayed philosophical considerations in the training. Only one
TM student said he perceived TM in spiritual terms, Alexander said.

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has blocked the entry
of Thai workers to protest the slaying of three of its embassy
workers in Thailand, a newspaper reported today.
   On Friday, Saudi Arabia threatened to close its embassy in the
Thai capital of Bangkok if the government fails to track down the
killers. The Saudi government earlier summoned the Thai ambassador
in Riyadh to hear the protest.
   Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ahmed bin Abdul-Aziz was quoted
in the Saudi daily Al-Jazira as saying the slayings were ``a
horrendous matter that has shocked and pained us all. King Fahd is
deeply concerned about his sons.''
   The coffins with the bodies of the three Saudi Embassy workers
were flown in Friday night aboard a special Saudi jet ordered by
the king.
   The deputy governor of Riyadh, Prince Sattam bin Abdul-Aziz, led
an official delegation to the airport and told reporters, ``These
are three martyrs who died for their religion and homeland ... at
the hands of evil.''
   According to reports from Bangkok on Thursday, gunmen killed the
three employees in two shootings that occurred minutes apart.
   They were identified as second secretary and consular head
Abdullah Abul-Rahman al-Basri, 32; consular officer Fahd Abdullah
al-Bahli, 35; and telex operator Ahmed Abdullah al-Saif, 26.
   Prince Ahmed said the ``necessary measures'' had been taken to
halt the entry of Thai workers in Saudi Arabia. About 140,000 Thais
live in Saudi Arabia, part of the 3 million expatriate labor force
in the kingdom.
   Thailand also has enjoyed good commercial and tourism ties with
Saudi Arabia.
   Last year, gunmen fatally shot a third secretary of the embassy,
Abdullah al-Malki. He was responsible for processing visa
applications.
   The crime has not been solved and speculation at the time said
the assailants could have been frustrated workers unable to secure
entry visas for the oil-rich kingdom.
   The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat said in a report today that
the same pistols that killed Maliki were used in this week's
murders. It quoted unidentified Thai police sources.

   With revolution in Eastern Europe accelerating
and Germans driving to reunite, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III is off this week on a diplomatic journey that tests the
influence of the superpowers to shape these fast-paced events.
   In Baker's bulging briefcase are a dozen tough problems, ranging
from the German issue and the sometimes nasty turns the changes in
Eastern Europe have taken to the lingering 12-year war in
Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed Marxist government and
U.S.-armed rebels.
   The centerpiece of Baker's nine-day trip, which begins Monday
evening, is a face-to-face session with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev toward the end of the week in Moscow. That will give
Baker a firsthand account of the course the Kremlin is taking on
German reunification and of how Gorbachev is addressing Soviet
political and economic problems.
   Rumors last week that Gorbachev might surrender his post as
general secretary of the Communist Party at a Central Committee
meeting Monday and Tuesday renewed U.S. interest in his personal
fate and the course of Soviet reform.
   Both President Bush, hailing in his State of the Union speech
``the new era in the world's affairs'' launched by Gorbachev, and
Baker, praising ``the reformers'' in testimony to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, are making a calculated effort to
bolster Gorbachev as he tries to overcome resistance to his program
of perestroika.
   Baker is taking new offers of technical cooperation to Moscow,
and in three days of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze hopes to remove some of the remaining roadblocks to
completion of a treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
missiles, submarines and bombers by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   The idea is to have a treaty ready for Bush and Gorbachev to
sign at a Washington summit meeting in June. Baker's talks with
Shevardnadze, which begin Wednesday night, are intended as
preparations for the event.
   Baker also is prepared to extend the promise of trade
privileges, provided the Soviets codify their recent easing of
emigration restrictions.
   At the same time, though, the Bush administration has to assess
ways of encouraging democratic trends in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe in the event Gorbachev's powers ebb.
   There seems to be little doubt, however, that the Bush-Baker
team is determined to cooperate with Gorbachev. The question that
hangs over Baker's mission, apart from the slow response of the
Soviet economy, is how much influence the two superpowers working
together can have on world events.
   The accelerating drive by East and West Germans to form one
country again _ and the tremors this causes among some Europeans _
apparently is only slightly responsive to U.S. and Soviet wishes.
   Gorbachev last week softened his opposition, saying unification
was not in doubt but must come as part of a revision of Europe's
political and military structure.
   Baker, meanwhile, reiterated U.S. support for reunification but
steered clear of picking and choosing among the approaches that
have surfaced.
   Among them is one by Hans Modrow, the East German premier, for a
neutral, single state that would belong neither to NATO nor the
Warsaw Pact, and another by West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher that would keep Germany in NATO but leave
the East German region demilitarized.
   Baker met with Genscher on Friday night on the German question
and planned a session with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas at
Shannon Airport in Ireland early Tuesday while Baker's jet is being
refueled.
   Pursuing a fast pace, Baker will then fly to Prague for 27 hours
in the capital of Czechoslovakia, the Central European ally of the
Soviet Union that is in the midst of an untroubled transition to
democracy.
   During that brief visit Baker will meet with President Vaclav
Havel and other leaders of the new government and make a speech in
which he is expected to strengthen his qualified endorsement of a
35-nation European summit meeting this year _ a Gorbachev formula
for easing East-West tensions.
   Bush set the tone for Baker's trip in his State of the Union
speech with a proposal to cut U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to
225,000, with a limit of 195,000 in Central Europe.
   That meshes with calls on Gorbachev by Czechoslovakia, Poland
and Hungary to remove Soviet forces _ and with Gorbachev's apparent
willingness to comply _ while leaving tens of thousands in East
Germany.
   What the Bush initiative may do to negotiations in Vienna is not
clear. NATO and the Warsaw Pact are in the midst of completing a
treaty to cut the troop levels to 275,000, as Bush proposed last
June, along with reductions in tanks and other weapons.
   The spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry, Gennady
Gerasimov, welcomed the new troop cut proposal on Thursday as ``a
step in the right direction,'' but a more complete response is
expected when Baker sees Shevardnadze.
   In this area, too, the influence of the superpowers has its
limits.
   While both the United States and the Soviet Union want to make
deeper cuts, some of the U.S. allies, particularly Britain, are
edgy about withdrawing around 100,000 American soldiers from
Europe. Administration officials acknowledge that if there is a
hangup it will be with the allies, although so far most of them
seem to be going along.
   On Saturday, at the end of his visit, Baker will make an
unprecedented appearance and answer questions before the 44-member
International Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's
chief legislative body.
   He will make a brief opening statement and then answer questions
for 90 minutes in the presence of American and Soviet reporters.
   On the way home, Baker will stop in Ottawa, Canada, to attend a
meeting Feb. 12-13 of NATO and Warsaw Pact officials to discuss an
``open skies'' proposal that would open U.S. and Soviet territory
to overflights.
   There is room on his schedule before then to squeeze in another
East European stop or to hold a meeting somewhere in Europe with
Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
Egypt.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker had no
other stops planned, but said she could not rule anything out.
   ``Anything is possible,'' she said.

   Residents in a neighborhood ravaged by drugs,
crime and poverty say they now even fear police after the fatal
shootings of two unarmed teen-agers by officers in separate
incidents.
   Hundreds marched on the local police precinct Thursday night to
protest the shootings in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. On
Friday, residents remained angry.
   ``People are tired of this,'' Manuel Vasquez, 38, said. ``We're
supposed to be more afraid of the criminals than the cops. It's
getting not that way anymore.''
   ``It's just murder, plain old murder,'' said one marcher at the
demonstration, where three people were arrested after rocks and
bottles were thrown at police in riot gear.
   Residents of Bushwick, which has one of the highest murder rates
in the city, have seen the number of people killed by police climb
in recent years.
   ``When they see you with gold, right away cops think you're a
drug dealer,'' said George Ponce, 20, as he stood Friday across
from the police precinct.
   Ponce, along with others, talked about the death of 14-year-old
Jose Louis Lebron, who was killed Wednesday in front of a candy
store after he was shot behind the right ear by Officer Frank
Albergo.
   A preliminary police investigation showed Albergo, who thought
he saw Lebron reaching into his jacket for a weapon, acted ``within
police guidelines.'' Police have promised a thorough investigation.
   Police said Lebron had robbed someone of $10.
   Four days earlier and five blocks away, Louis Liranso, 17, was
shot in the back and killed by Officer Hyda Hernandez after
Liranso, who was unarmed, allegedly lowered his hands and turned
toward the officer.
   Hernandez has been suspended and a grand jury is examining the
case.
   Residents mince no words about the shootings.
   ``Killer cop Albergo,'' was painted on a blue badge on a wall
near the slaying scene.
   And on the sidewalk where Lebron died were the words, ``Killed
by a man in blue.''
   But one officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Lebron was a neighborhood tough who bullied others and was ``always
on the street, hanging out and drinking.''
   The Hispanic officer, who described walking the beat in Bushwick
as ``wearing a uniform, standing around and hoping nothing goes on
around you,'' said local youths ``won't back down if they're with
one another, not even to an officer.''
   Lebron was the seventh person fatally shot by police in January;
six of the shootings have occurred in Brooklyn. In 1989, 30 people
were killed by police; in 1988, 25 died and 14 died in 1987.
   On Friday, police fatally shot a teen-ager carrying what turned
out to be an unloaded gun and 35 vials of crack after he attempted
to hold up a man, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
Police shot Robert Cole, 13, as he approached officers and was
warned three times to drop his handgun, Vreeland said.
   Lebron was recalled as a happy kid.
   ``He was always smiling,'' said his 22-year-old brother, Ruben,
wiping a tear from his cheek. ``He was the clown of the block. If
this tragedy happened to someone else, he'd make us laugh.''

   Don Edwards got a good look at the House
Un-American Activities Committee when he arrived in the nation's
capital nearly three decades ago. He never wanted to see anything
like it again.
   Edwards, 75, is now in his 14th term as a Democratic
representative from California. During those years this one-time
Young Republican and former FBI agent has acquired a reputation as
one of the House's most outspoken yet effective civil libertarians.
   Conservatives grumble that he has thwarted them on abortion,
school prayer and a wide range of other potentially explosive
issues. Liberals, meanwhile, have come to venerate him for his
willingness to speak out when others fear the political
consequences.
   When President Bush launched his war on drugs, for example,
Edwards warned that the president's proposals would move the
country ever closer to ``a police state.''
   ``In a free society, values are not imposed by wholesale arrests
and imprisonment of minor offenders,'' he declared.
   He blasted Bush as ``trigger happy'' in Panama, much as he had
called the U.S. invasion of Grenada under Ronald Reagan
``international outlawry.''
   This year, Edwards is a chief sponsor of legislation to
counteract Supreme Court rulings on job bias that dismayed civil
rights forces last year.
   He also is pushing a bill to erase the impact of a 1989 ruling
that widened the power of states to restrict abortions. He concedes
that chances of approval this year are not the best but plans
full-scale hearings in his Judiciary subcommittee anyway, doubtless
with an eye to driving home the election-year message.
   If anti-crime legislation currently in the Senate reaches the
House, the spotlight again is likely to fall on Edwards. He makes
no bones about his dislike for a provision that would ease
restrictions on the kind of evidence prosecutors may introduce in
criminal trials.
   Despite his combative role, Edwards' presence is far from
fierce. His affability has made him popular in the House despite
his naysaying. Over the congressional recess, he grew a moustache
for the first time in his life but told an interviewer that top
aide Roberta Haeberle had ``ordered'' him to shave it off. ``I have
to,'' he chortled.
   Born in San Jose, the heart of the district he now represents,
Edwards was educated in public schools there, Stanford University
and Stanford law school. Before coming to Washington, he was an FBI
agent, a naval intelligence and gunnery officer and founder of a
title insurance business.
   So conservative was Edwards in younger days that he became a
leader of California Young Republicans and once led a candlelight
demonstration of support for Richard Nixon. Over the years, he has
given a variety of reasons for his 180-degree political turn.
   They have included his experiences in the Navy in World War II
and the advent of nuclear weapons. In an interview, he suggested
the chief catalyst was that ``when I got here in January 1963 I was
terribly offended by the House Un-American Activities Committee.''
   Edwards was a stern critic of the committee, whose hearings into
alleged communist subversion in the 1950s were labeled ``witch
hunts'' by liberals. It was Edwards who offered the resolution in
the Democratic Caucus that led to abolition of the panel, whose
name by that time had been changed to the House Internal Security
Committee.
   ``I remember the day we did it in,'' he says with evident
satisfaction. The panel's once dreaded files are today locked up
for 50 years and stored in a Capitol Hill basement under custody of
the House Judiciary Committee.
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights, Edwards has considerable power to block
legislation dear to conservatives. And he has done so often,
especially in the case of proposed amendments to the Constitution.
   He has blocked amendments to ban abortion, halt school busing,
restrict the president to a single term and require a balanced
budget, among other things, by locking them up in his subcommittee
and throwing away the key. As a result, the proposals never reach
the House floor for a vote.
   ``Don Edwards is the guardian of the Constitution,'' says Ralph
Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights. ``And his subcommittee has been a graveyard for regressive
and unconstitutional legislation, so he has blocked the right-wing
agenda as well as implemented the progressive agenda on civil
rights.''
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., once complained that Edwards' panel
is ``the Bermuda Triangle of proposed constitutional amendments.''
   In Edwards' view, the Constitution has worked just fine and
doesn't need to be tampered with, especially not with proposals to
restrict civil and individual rights.
   ``The subcommittee that I chair takes very seriously its
responsibility to protect the Constitution,'' he says. ``I think
that it is my obligation to use every legitimate weapon that we
have to defend the Constitution.''
   In recent years, just two proposed amendments have emerged from
the committee. One would provide the District of Columbia with
House voting rights. The other is the Equal Rights Amendment. ``We
think that would be beneficial,'' Edwards says.
   ``I'm sure he takes heat'' for his outspoken ways, says Althea
Simmons, chief lobbyist for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, ``because civil rights is sometimes
in fashion and sometimes out of fashion, but you can count on Don
Edwards whether its fashionable or not.''
   ``Not only does he almost always vote correctly from our point
of view but he is willing to speak out on very controversial
issues,'' says Morton Halperin, head of the Washington office of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Edwards pooh-poohs the political dangers. He cites his first
vote against funds for the Un-American Activities Committee. The
clerk was so surprised that he did a double take and called
Edwards' name again.
   ``It hit the fan back home,'' recalls Edwards, ``but then before
you know it, people were saying, `Well, it wasn't much of a
committee anyway.'''
   Democrats say Edwards's constituents for the most part see him
as a nice guy and don't worry too much about his crusading.
   Their relaxed view, however, was not shared by Edwards' one-time
boss, the late FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. ``He didn't like
criticism,'' the congressman recalls. ``I felt it was my duty to
criticize the agency.''
   Some time back when Edwards was going through some personal
turmoil he considered leaving Congress and went so far as to
announce his retirement. On the wall in his Watergate apartment
today is a framed copy of an FBI memo reporting his decision.
   The director's comment was scrawled at the bottom: ``Good
riddance _ H.''
   It was more than a little premature _ that was 20 years ago and
Edwards soon changed his mind and ran for re-election after all.

   If the allegations are to be believed, right-wing
extremists in the MI5 intelligence service schemed to portray two
former prime ministers and an array of other politicians as
terrorist dupes and Soviet stooges.
   These lurid tales, once confined to the political fringes, have
suddenly gained a measure of credibility through a series of
official disclosures. Although the allegations date back years
before she came to power, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher finds
herself caught in mounting clamor for an inquiry.
   The basic claim is that in 1973-74, when Britain was suffering
from Irish separatist violence, trade union militancy and weak
government, secret service right-wingers plotted to destabilize any
politician, from Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and Edward Heath
downward, who didn't share their hard-line anti-communist views.
   The main source of these claims is Colin Wallace, a former army
press officer in his native Northern Ireland, who says his secret
job was to spread disinformation.
   Wallace, 46, says he didn't mind using his natural charm and air
of trustworthiness to spread lies about terrorists at the height of
the province's troubles in the early 1970s.
   But he says he became uneasy when the disinformation campaign,
code-named ``Clockwork Orange,'' turned against politicians.
   ``We were fabricating information that alleged that key
individuals were corrupt in terms of their moral, political or
financial behavior through their links with communists or their
extramarital activities,'' Wallace said in an interview.
   Wallace says his disenchantment grew over suspicions that
homosexual abuse at a Belfast boys' orphanage was covered up to
protect or blackmail senior unidentified figures.
   In 1975, Wallace was dismissed for leaking a document to a
journalist. He insists the leak was part of his job, and that the
dismissal was contrived to silence him.
   Wallace says this was followed by a series of attempts to
destroy his credibility by portraying him as a fantasist. In 1981,
he was jailed for manslaughter _ a frame-up, he claims.
   Released in 1986, he has sought to interest the media in his
story, with limited success, until Tuesday, when Armed Forces
Minister Archie Hamilton told Parliament that recently discovered
papers suggested the possibility that Wallace was indeed under
verbal instructions to engage in disinformation.
   Hamilton also confirmed some of Wallace's specific claims, such
as that the dirty tricks included using forged CIA identity cards
in 1973.
   Hamilton insisted the disinformation was directed only at the
Irish Republican Army, and never expanded to smear politicians. He
said the operation had no clearance from senior officials, and was
shut down in the mid-1970s.
   But it was the first admission by a government official that a
dirty-tricks campaign existed, and that Wallace was part of it. It
triggered uproar in Parliament and the media.
   The next day, Mrs. Thatcher disclosed that several statements
she and other ministers had made on the matter ``were incorrect or
require clarification.''
   She said these past statements had relied on information
provided by civil servants, and that there had been ``errors in the
handling of departmental papers.''
   But she stood by her previous statements that there was no
evidence of politicians being smeared.
   The events in question predate 1975, when Mrs. Thatcher
succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative Party leader. But they are
an embarrassment, given her record of unwavering support for the
security services.
   Wallace has a file in his handwriting which he says consists of
notes fed to him in the 1970s by ``security service intelligence
officers'' to be used against politicians.
   The notes, reproduced in a book about his case, are mainly
insinuations about alleged Soviet influence over the Labor Party,
such as the bizarre theory that the KGB murdered party leader Hugh
Gaitskell to make way for the supposedly pro-Soviet Harold Wilson.
   Merlyn Rees, the chief minister in Northern Ireland during part
of the disinformation campaign, displayed on television a pro-IRA
leaflet which he said had been doctored to include his and other
Labor politicians' names.
   Conservative Party moderates, including former Prime Minister
Heath, also turn up in Wallace's notes.
   The conservative Daily Telegraph, in an editorial, dismissed
Wallace as ``a loose cannon'' who was being exploited to embarrass
the government, and Wallace's critics say that having once been
paid to lie, he can't expect to be believed now.
   Wallace replies: ``Don't believe me; have a look for yourselves.
All the evidence is there.''
   An inquiry has been ordered into whether Wallace was unfairly
dismissed. But opposition lawmakers, as well as a few Tories, want
a much broader inquiry.
   ``This will not go away. There is no hiding place,'' Rees warned
In Parliament. ``The next Labor government will look at it and
those who are hiding things from this government had better
remember that.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Disciplined For Singing Spiritual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black lawmaker who led students in
singing a spiritual on Martin Luther King's birthday has been told
she will lose her committee assignment for violating the chamber's
rules of decorum.
   House of Delegates Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell Jr. said Friday
that Juanita D. Miller defied him after he refused her request to
let a high school group sing on the House floor Jan. 15.
   ``It is a disciplinary action. She and everyone has to know that
open defiance is not the way,'' Mitchell said. ``Certain things are
followed by tradition.''
   As Miller, a Democrat from Prince George's County, finished an
emotional speech about the slain civil rights leader, she began
singing ``Give Us This Day,'' and the choir joined in from the
visitors' gallery. She said the students began singing
spontaneously.
   Mitchell is ``going to flog Juanita Miller for being an uppity
black delegate,'' said Wayne Curry, a black lawyer and president of
the Prince George's County Chamber of Commerce. ``He wants to make
her behave and put her in the closet in the big house.''
   Mitchell, who is white, cited a House policy barring non-members
from performing in the chamber.
   Not all legislators perceived racial overtones in the move.
   ``I think it's a matter of internal discipline,'' said Sen.
Albert R. Wynn, also a Prince George's Democrat and one of six
blacks in the 47-member Senate. ``I don't think it's racial.''
   Miller said she was told Mitchell would reassign her from the
House Economic Matters Committee, which oversees business, banking,
consumer and labor laws, to the Judiciary Committee.
   The two committees are about equally prestigious, although
members of Economic Matters tend to receive more campaign
contributions from industry groups they regulate.
   Miller noted that the House has observed St. Patrick's Day for
decades by having a non-member sing ``Danny Boy.''
   ``I want to see what happens on St. Patrick's Day this year,''
she said. ``Is (Mitchell) telling me, as an African-American, that
we can't do this but they can because it's been done for 20 years?''

<HEAD>Thousands of `Discouraged Workers' Part of Hidden Unemployment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Americans who have stopped
looking for work because they are discouraged are part of a
``hidden unemployment'' problem that some analysts say boosts the
real jobless rate to around 8 percent.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's
unemployment rate, or the number of Americans actively seeking
work, held steady in January at 5.3 percent for the eighth straight
month.
   So-called discouraged workers, however, are not included in the
department's monthly unemployment figure, an exclusion some
analysts consider misleading.
   Those experts also think a percentage of ``under-employed''
workers, or those who hold part-time jobs but would rather be
full-time, should be included to give a more accurate picture of
the nation's jobless problem.
   ``We think including those numbers would give a truer picture of
what's going on,'' said Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the 14.2
million-member AFL-CIO.
   ``The unemployment rate hides a lot of things and masks many of
the problems with our economy. We need to be taking a broader
look,'' said Barry Bluestone, a political economist at the
University of Massachusetts.
   Because the number of discouraged workers tends to rise and fall
with economic swings, some economists believe those people _ or at
least some of them _ should be counted in the unemployment figures.
   There were about 827,000 discouraged workers in the final
quarter of 1989 _ the last period for which figures are available _
while 1.8 million Americans had given up on looking for work at the
height of the 1982 recession.
   ``The number increases during recessions and decreases during
good times. If you believe a growth in the number of discouraged
workers means an increase in unemployment, then it should be
counted,'' said Sar Levitan, an economist at George Washington
University.
   Discouraged workers have been overlooked as the nation enjoys a
relatively low and steady jobless rate, according to some analysts.
   ``There's been relatively low unemployment for the past few
years, and those left behind are being forgotten. By and large, we
pay very little attention to them,'' Levitan said.
   In the Labor Department's unemployment report for December, a
quarterly report showed that had all discouraged workers been
counted, along with half of the involuntary part-timers, the
unemployment rate would have been 7.9 percent.
   However, others contend the Labor Department includes too many
people when calculating the official unemployment level, such as
students and those who have been jobless only for a few weeks.
   ``There are as many people who think we overestimate as there
are those who think we underestimate,'' said Deborah Klein, an
economist with the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Some discouraged workers have lacked jobs in months and
therefore should not be considered part of the workforce, Ms. Klein
said.
   ``It's a state of mind. Two people in the same situation might
respond differently,'' she said.
   The argument over what information to include has been going on
since measurements for unemployment were defined in the 1940s, Ms.
Klein said. Over the years, outside commissions have studied and
refined the definitions. Congress does not control the guidelines.
   ``It is not willy-nilly, though it is not mandated. We would not
feel comfortable with wholesale changes. The definition is one
that's stood the test of time,'' Ms. Klein said.
   Levitan headed the last commission to study the issue and
recommended in 1979 that further review be given to including a
portion of discouraged workers in the official unemployment figure.
When the Reagan administration took office, officials cited a lack
of resources in turning down the request, Levitan said.
   About half of those who classify themselves as discouraged
workers should be counted as unemployed, Levitan said, which would
still put the unemployment figure above the government's official
rate.
   Bluestone and a colleague, labor historian Jim Green, said many
of the discouraged workers probably lost high-paying factory jobs
in the recent manufacturing slump and cannot bring themselves to
accept lower wages.
   ``If I were in that situation, I would probably also say, `Geez.
What's the point? I'm working only to be poor,''' Green said. ``It
used to be that if you worked hard and saved your money, things
would improve. It's not necessarily like that anymore.''

<HEAD>Vets Who Built Vietnam Memorial Soliciting Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The veterans who built the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial are going back to their contributors, this time asking for
$376,500 to repair hairline cracks and correct errors in names on
the granite wall and pursue a claim against the contractors.
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc., which raised $7
million from the public to build the monument, sent a solicitation
last fall to 100,000 addresses, in a mailing to test the likely
response, and a revised mailing of 700,000 pieces recently. Further
appeals are planned over the course of this year.
   ``As I write to you today, I desperately hope that great healing
spirit still exists, because we need your help urgently,'' reads
one of the fund appeals. It is signed by fund president Jan
Scruggs, the former infantryman who conceived of the memorial and
saw it through to its completion in 1982.
   ``You see, a number of cracks in the granite wall have been
found,'' Scruggs' letter says. ``Eventually we may need to replace
these panels. But it is imperative that we buy the stone now. If we
wait, the replacement panels won't match the rest of the memorial.
   ``Our attorneys have filed a claim against the contractors, but
that may take years. Quite frankly, your memorial can't wait! ...
We need to raise $376,500.''
   Of that amount, said Bob Frank, a Virginia accountant who is
treasurer of the tax-exempt fund, $90,000 is needed to replace
black granite panels which have developed hairline cracks and
$111,000 to engrave additional names on the memorial and to replace
misspelled names.
   The remainder is to be set aside to pay the costs of arbitration
in the attempt to persuade the contractors to absorb the cost of
replacing cracked panels, Frank said.
   The granite for the replacement panels has been purchased and is
weathering at the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in hopes the new
panels will match those on the existing wall, Scruggs said. ``In
retrospect, it's something I wished we'd done in 1982,'' he said.
   From time to time, names have been added when the Defense
Department determined that the death of a Vietnam veteran had been
the result of war wounds or when misspellings were found.
   The monument now carries 58,174 names. Most of the errors were
on lists provided by the Defense Department, Frank and Scruggs said.
   They said they hope the fund drive actually will raise between
$1 million and $1.5 million, enough to build an endowment for
future improvements, repairs and contingencies. Frank said the fund
now has $450,000 in the bank.
   Frank declined to say how effective the mailings have been since
they are still undergoing testing. ``It is premature to discuss the
outcome, but we are very encouraged,'' he said.
   Scruggs said, however, that the solicitation was drawing a
response from about 5 percent of recipients. He said that was
encouraging because charity drives generally get only about a 2
percent return.
   The appeal is being conducted by a professional fund-raising
organization, using rented list of potential donors. Scruggs said
the letter was professionally written.
   Scruggs said previously the fund had staged rock concerts or
sought corporate donations to meet such expenses as installing
lights and wider walkways and adding names to the 493-foot wall and
conducting Veterans Day and Memorial Day ceremonies at the monument.
   Under an agreement with the National Park Service, the fund pays
for permanent changes to the memorial and the government pays for
day-to-day maintenance, guards, cleaning and the like, said Park
Service spokesman Earle Kittleman.
   For a number of years, the monument was the most popular
visitors' stop in Washington. Now, Kittleman said, the monument and
the nearby Lincoln Memorial both draw about the same number of
visitors.

   Democrats will have to decide between major
meetings next month in New Orleans or Indianapolis, and the rivalry
has more to do with philosophy than a preference for pork
tenderloin or jambalaya.
   For party chairman Ronald H. Brown and the members of the
Democratic National Committee, the choice was easy. They're going
to Indianapolis to showcase Indiana's youthful Democratic governor,
Evan Bayh, and tout their chances of capturing the Senate seat once
held by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Another large group of Democrats, including many of the party's
leading officeholders, will convene at the same time in New Orleans.
   Somehow _ and nobody is willing to call it anything but an
accident _ the DNC and the Democratic Leadership Council chose the
same dates the last week in March for their meetings.
   ``It was not some deliberate picking a fight,'' said Brown when
asked about the conflict. ``When we set the date, I didn't know
about the DLC meeting.''
   ``As far as I know it was inadvertent,'' said DLC executive
director Al From, who went on to suggest that the most important
party business would take place in New Orleans.
   ``They're (the DNC) not going to do anything,'' he said. ``It's
a routine business meeting as opposed to something that might be
really spectacular.''
   From said the DLC, formed in 1985 by elected officials concerned
about what they perceived as the national party's leftward drift,
would spend its time in New Orleans discussing an agenda for the
'90s ``that will lead this party and the country in a different
direction.''
   He said that at the DNC sessions ``the same old activists get
together and dance on the same ground that people lose on every
time.''
   Brown will not ignore the DLC. He plans to address its closing
session, and deliver a tough message calling on its members to stop
bashing the national party.
   ``I'd be less than honest if I didn't think that some of the
speeches that I've heard recently are just kind of gratuitous,''
said the party chairman.
   He declined to specify which speeches bothered him. But an
attack on national Democrats by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., seemed to
fit the bill.
   Robb told a DLC meeting that Democrats were in ``a quandary
because we have difficulty conceiving of our mission in terms other
than federal activism.''
   The senator, a former chairman of the DLC and one of its
founding members, described the party as ``in thrall to the special
interests.''
   Brown made it clear he was tired of attacks on the national
party.
   ``We've been moving in a pretty solid, pragmatic, common-sense
direction this year and I think everybody acknowledges that,'' he
said ``So when folks attack the national party I don't know who
they're talking about.''
   The chairman said the message he wanted to deliver to the DLC
was that while they and the DNC don't always agree ``we're
certainly moving in the same direction.''
   Shortly after he was elected party chairman last year, Brown
attended a DLC meeting and said pointedly that ``I know there are
many in this room who were less than wildly enthusiastic about the
prospect of Ron Brown being chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.''
   For Brown, the political attraction of Indianapolis was clear.
Party leaders view 34-year-old Bayh, the first Democratic governor
of Indiana in 16 years, as a rising star. They also have their eyes
set on Republican Sen. Dan Coats, appointed last year to replace
Quayle. Coats has yet to be tested in a statewide race.
   While the DLC will talk issues, the DNC members will discuss the
rules for selecting the 1992 presidential nominee. No major changes
are foreseen.
   But the DNC remains the party's governing body, a fact pointed
out to From, who responded, ``That is true. They are, at least at
the moment.''

   ``The Pat Sajak Show,'' reeling in the
ratings race against late-nighters Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall,
is undergoing a makeover that will include a round-table chat with
guests.
   Starting Monday, the ``Sajak'' show will feature a new set, new
music, less banter with announcer Dan Miller and no exchanges at
all with bandleader Tom Scott.
   On some shows, the host's traditional entrance to applause will
be skipped, with Sajak instead already sitting down when the show
opens.
   Michael Weisman, the new executive producer of the 13-month-old
CBS show, said the changes are designed to overcome the talk show's
``loser'' image.
   ``What we're trying to do is make Pat as comfortable as
possible, play up his strength and get away from that old cliched
talk-show look,'' he said.
   Celebrity guests and interviews will still be a part of the
show, but Weisman also is considering documentary-style pieces on
real-life personalities, such as outrageous cab drivers or nutty
waitresses.

   If someone offers to sell you
Roseanne Barr's love letters to her new husband, don't print them
unless you want trouble.
   The letters were stolen, her publicist, Alana Rothstein, said
Friday. The star of ``Roseanne'' married fellow comedian Tom Arnold
last month.
   ``We're saying, `Yes, it is for real, and yes, they are stolen,
and if somebody decides to publish them, then down the road they'll

   Barr's public relations firm had received inquiries from several

letters, Rothstein said.
   She said several of the letters were stolen sometime within the

   Italian critics praised the newest film by Federico
Fellini, ``The Voice of the Moon,'' which opened in 170 cities
throughout the country.
   Scores of people lined up to see the latest work by the director
of ``La Dolce Vita,'' ``8{'' and ``Amarcord.'' The movie opened
Thursday.
   The Milan daily Corriere Della Sera described the film as
``stylistically severe, artistically superior and professionally
beyond reproach.''
   Fellini's 24th work, the quixotic tale of two lunatics wandering
the Italian countryside, did not receive unanimous praise in the
capital, however.
   ``Roman viewers of `The Voice of the Moon' are divided between
enthusiasm and boredom,'' the daily La Republica said.
   The $22.5 million movie features comic actors Roberto Benigni
and Paolo Villagio. It will be presented at the Cannes Film
Festival in May.

   AIDS patient Ryan White has received a
``Mickey'' award from the Mickey Mouse Club.
   The 14-inch, gold-colored statuette, which is awarded to
``children who make a difference,'' was mailed to the 18-year-old
because he was too sick to travel to Florida to receive it, said
his mother, Jeanne White.
   Ryan had been scheduled to be on the ``Mickey Mouse Club Show''
in November and be inducted into the Mickey Mouse Club Hall of Fame.
   Ryan, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from a transfusion,
received wide attention in 1985 when his family sued a school near
Kokomo for not allowing him to attend. A judge ruled that Ryan
should be allowed to attend class because AIDS cannot be spread
through casual contact.
   Since then, Ryan and his family have moved to Cicero, a town of
about 3,200, where they were welcomed by the school district.
   For the last six months, Ryan has been suffering from numerous
ailments, including a protein deficiency, Ms. White said.

   Former baseball star Steve Garvey and ex-wife
have reached an agreement in the child custody battle that at one
point landed her in jail, lawyers say.
   No terms were announced, but after the closed meeting Friday
with Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild, attorney Stephen
Kolodny said, ``The nature of the agreement resolves all of the
issues before the court.'' He represents Cynthia Truhan, the former
Mrs. Garvey.
   Neither Garvey, the former first baseman for the Los Angeles
Dodgers and San Diego Padres, nor his ex-wife appeared in court.
The couple have two teen-age daughters.
   It was not clear what impact the settlement would have on Ms.
Truhan's contempt-of-court jail sentence for violating child
visitation orders.
   On Oct. 3, Rothschild ordered her to serve a five-day sentence.
But she was released the day she entered jail after an appeals
court ruled that Rothschild should have set bail after denying a
request for a jury trial.

   Conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim has
canceled an appearance because of chicken pox.
   The 47-year-old musician, who rarely appears in London, had been
scheduled to perform Bach's Goldberg Variations at the Barbican
performing arts center on Sunday. He pulled out on doctor's orders,
the concert hall said Saturday.
   Barenboim, born in Argentina and reared in Israel, last year was
chosen as the next music director of the Chicago Symphony, shortly
after his firing as director of the new Paris Opera House. The
Chicago appoinment takes effect in the fall of 1991. Barenboim will
succeed Sir Georg Solti.

<HEAD>Senate Ethics Probers Ready for `Unpleasant Task'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a Senate often compared to a club where
members take care of their own, the Democratic and Republican
leaders of the Ethics Committee are ready to sweep aside ``personal
emotions'' and judge the conduct of seven politically troubled
colleagues.
   Chairman Howell T. Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren B.
Rudman, R-N.H., said in interviews that they have an institution to
protect and won't be influenced by close relationships or intense
media attention.
   ``We're dealing with the reputation of individuals and the
integrity of the institution,'' Rudman said. ``You must find the
truth and you must act on it. You cannot be swayed by personal
emotions. The public ought to have full confidence that the members
of this committee care about the institution more than anything
else.''
   Added Heflin, ``It's an unpleasant task but it has to be
performed'' because the Constitution requires the chambers of
Congress to judge the conduct of their own members. ``The integrity
of the institution supersedes the clubbiness that might exist.''
   Neither Rudman nor Heflin would discuss details of the cases
before them, and Rudman said he agreed to be interviewed only so
there could be ``a better public understanding'' of the committee's
work.
   The most intense attention is focused on the investigation of
five senators who received some $1.3 million from businessman
Charles H. Keating Jr. and who intervened with regulators on behalf
of his now-failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   The so-called ``Keating Five'' are Republican John McCain of
Arizona; and Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of
Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Alan Cranston of
California.
   The committee also is investigating whether Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato, R-N.Y., steered federal housing contracts to friends and
contributors; and whether Sen. David Durerberger, R-Minn., evaded
outside income limits in a book promotion deal, improperly charged
the Senate rent for a Minneapolis condominium he partially owned,
and received improper reimbursements for trips to the Boston area _
made in part to see his marriage counselor.
   Rudman admitted the Senate ``is certainly a club in which
members protect each other, I suppose in a legislative way.''
   But he maintained the ``history of the Senate in recent years is
that when serious ethics matters have been brought before us, the
importance of the institution transcends personal friendship. I
would cite the Harrison Williams case and the Talmadge case.''
   In October 1979, the Senate voted 81-15 follow the Ethics
Committee's advice and denounced then-Sen. Herman E. Talmadge,
D-Ga. for ``reprehensible'' handling of government funds.
   Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., resigned in 1982, just as
the Senate was about to go along with the Ethics Committee's
recommendation of expulsion. Williams had already been convicted in
the bribery and conspiracy investigation known as Abscam.
   One of his main accusers in the Senate debate was Heflin, then
the senior Democrat on the committee, who gave one of the final
speeches of the debate urging expulsion.
   Heflin now says, ``We have to make tough decisions all the time.
We have to say no to senators on vital issues that affect their
re-election.''
   Members often are assigned to the committee by their
backgrounds, so it's no accident that Heflin, 68, headed the
Alabama Ethics Commission from 1969-71 and was chief justice of the
Alabama Supreme Court from 1971-77.
   Rudman, 59, was attorney general of New Hampshire from 1970-76.
Other committee members are Sens. David Pryor, D-Ark.; Terry
Sanford, D-N.C.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C. and Trent Lott, R-Miss.
   Rudman defended committee rules that place the utmost secrecy on
the committee's investigative and grand jury phases, before
exposing the trial phase to public view.
   ``I would never, ever, think a preliminary inquiry or an initial
review (the grand jury phase) should be publicized step-by-step''
to satisfy the public or news media, he said.
   ``If you were to trot out every allegation without having the
chance to corroborate or carefully draw it out, you'd have people
trashed all over the press who might wind up being totally
innocent.''

   Mexico and its foreign creditor banks sign a
historic debt reduction agreement Sunday that will save the country
$1.7 billion a year in interest and provide a measure of security
to the banks.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has called the renegotiation
essential to solving Mexico's economic problems but warned it alone
will not guarantee growth.
   ``The result of the negotiation has been rational for the
creditor banks and satisfactory for Mexico,'' Salinas said in a
speech Thursday in Switzerland.
   The first major agreement under U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady's debt reduction strategy will lop $7 billion off Mexico's
$48.5 billion commercial bank debt, save $1.7 billion a year of the
$9 billion a year the country pays in interest and bring in $1.5
billion in new loans over the next three years.
   Mexico's total foreign debt is $92 billion, down from $107
billion in 1987, according to the government, the second highest in
the developing world after Brazil's $114 billion.
   Sunday's agreement will be signed by the heads of 15 major banks
who made up the so-called ``steering committee'' that negotiated
the accord for all the creditor institutions.
   The new plan gave 460 participating banks three options to
reduce Mexico's debt burden: Reduce the principal on their loans to
the government by 35 percent, drop interest to a fixed rate of 6.25
percent annually or grant new loans of 25 percent of their
outstanding Mexican debt.
   Many banks combined options. Reductions of the principal account
for $20 billion of the renegotiated debt, interest reductions for
$22.5 billion and new loans for $6 billion.
   In exchange, banks picking the principal and interest reductions
receive Mexican government bonds for the remaining debt. The bonds
are backed by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds and the first 18
months of interest on them is guaranteed by a $7 billion package of
multilateral credits and Mexican funds.
   ``I believe it helped the banks quite a lot. For at least a
couple of years more they can feel calmer about the quality of the
Mexican debt,'' said Manuel Sanchez, director of the private Center
for Analysis and Economic Research.
   But apart from those in the agreement, few new foreign
commercial bank loans are expected, and officials and analysts say
the next step toward economic stability is Mexico's.
   ``What we have to do and what we are doing in Mexico is to
create attractive conditions for doing business in Mexico,''
Assistant Treasury Secretary Angel Gurria, the government's debt
negotiator, said.
   Salinas' government has opened the domestic market to imports,
stepped up the sale of state-owned enterprises to private
ownership, relaxed foreign investment controls and brought down
inflation with an economic program that controls wages and prices.
   If the government continues such steps, Gurria said, money will
come.
   Sanchez warned that the progress toward stabilization is
precarious.
   ``We are on a fine line, very thin, in which any event can make
us fall into another crisis,'' he said.
   The agreement to reduce the debt payments followed Mexico's
efforts to repay the interest in recent months, unlike other major
Latin debtors.
   Brazil was $4.4 billion behind in interest payments to private
foreign creditors in December. Argentina, which has a $64 billion
debt, has about $4 billion in interest overdue.

   Restaurant patrons will no longer have to
mix their own cocktails under a bill about to become law in Utah,
but critics say the liquor law in the Mormon-dominated state will
be as bewildering as ever.
   ``If they think Utah's joked about now, this is comical,'' said
Kurt Nelson, owner of one of the state's ``beer bars,'' which will
face new restrictions under the law even as things are loosened up
for restaurants.
   Until 1988, restaurant diners intent on a cocktail had to order
a mixer, buy a minibottle of liquor at an in-house package store,
return to the table and mix the drink themselves. They could also
bring in their own liquor, bought at a state-run liquor store,
under the time-honored practice of ``brown-bagging.''
   Since 1988, waiters have been permitted to bring minibottles to
the table, but the diner still had to do the mixing. Only private
clubs, which sell memberships at a minimum of $5 for two weeks,
could serve a mixed drink without a meal.
   The bill that sailed through the Legislature, hungry for tourism
and economic growth, brings Utah to the brink of
liquor-by-the-drink by allowing licensed restaurants as well as
private clubs to serve cocktails at the table.
   But the drinks will be weaker _ the bill requires that
restaurants and clubs use bottle meters that dispense an ounce of
liquor; minibottles held 1.7 ounces. And brown-bagging will be
prohibited, in restaurants and in beer bars.
   Utah's restrictive liquor laws date generally from the end of
Prohibition in 1930s. Residents may have complained about the laws
in the past, but they adjusted. It's tourists that the bill's
sponsors were out to accommodate.
   With tourism an increasingly important part of the economy and
the prospect of being selected host of the 1998 Winter Olympics,
Utah had to step into the American mainstream, sponsors said.
   Indeed, the legislation permits lounges at Salt Lake
International Airport to sell drinks to travelers, making the
airport the state's only ``free-pour'' zone.
   ``I do think we've made a giant step forward,'' Rep. Stan
Smedley said Friday after the bill gained final clearance in the
House and Senate. Gov. Norm Bangerter said he'll sign the
legislation when it reaches his desk this week.
   The bill's drafters were keenly aware of the Mormon Church ban
on alcohol. The faith counts as members 70 percent of the state's
1.7 million people and more than 90 percent of its 104 lawmakers,
and the church's world headquarters are three blocks from the
Capitol.
   ``There was to be no change in the state's philosophy of
control, availability to those who do drink and consideration of
those who don't,'' said Sen. Richard Carling, chairman of the task
force that fashioned the bill.
   Last year, calls from church representatives to senators doomed
a bill that would have allowed passengers in limousines and
chartered buses to bring alcohol aboard.
   This time, church officials said they would not oppose the new
bill, virtually guaranteeing passage. Among its other changes, the
new legislation allows limo and bus passengers to ride and drink,
with some limitations.
   But liquor opponents have much to cheer about in the new law.
   Besides the crackdown on brown-bagging, which beer bar owners
say will eliminate their highly profitable sales of mixers, the new
law puts an end to ``happy hours'' and retail sales of beer by the
keg.
   The demise of happy hour sounds ``the death knoll for a lot of
taverns,'' said Greg Arata, who owns one of the 415 beer bars in
Utah.
   Perhaps the most hard-hit will be rural beer bars unable to
afford the license and equipment necessary to upgrade their status
to that of a private club or a restaurant, said Utah Tavern Owners
Association lobbyist Randy Horiuchi.
   Horiuchi also warned that old habits die hard, and bartenders
will find themselves in the difficult position of trying to keep
customers from sneaking in liquor.
   ``What laws like this do is force Utahns to break the laws,'' he
said.
   That doesn't bother tavern owner Nelson, who's seen too many
customers overdo it.
   But Nelson said visitors will be confused if they can get a
drink at the airport, only to find themselves searching for a club
or licensed restaurant in Salt Lake City or nearby ski resorts.
   `They'll stop at the airport, have a drink, then get to New York
or L.A. and say, `Hey, I had a drink in Utah,''' Nelson said.
``That's just duping the traveler.''

   FBI agents have grilled a Bible-quoting
junk dealer, fingerprinted an alleged gun runner and dug up a
septic tank looking for a typewriter, but how close they are to
solving a series of mail bombings that killed a judge and a lawyer
no one is saying.
   Scores of federal agents, who set up offices in a vacant bank
building two weeks ago, have made some splashy raids that provided
grist for rumor mills. But it appears no arrests are imminent in
the December bombings.
   The latest action by the FBI, a daylong search Friday of the
home and print shop of an Enterprise man indicted on gun
exportation charges, left investigators with more than a dozen
boxes of confiscated documents to examine.
   Doug Marshall, an FBI spokesman in Mobile, said Friday the
investigation here would continue indefinitely.
   The most well-known figure in the investigation, salvage store
owner Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, has been closely scrutinized but not
charged.
   ``It's time for them to bark up another tree,'' he said Friday.
   Brian Fleming, the print shop operator subjected to the search
on Friday, has not been charged either.
   Fleming and his wife have been fingerprinted but not questioned
in the case, said their attorney, John Knowles. Knowles said
authorities are making a futile attempt to link the bomb cases to
Fleming's indictment on a charge of conspiring to export firearms,
reportedly to Northern Ireland.
   Fleming pleaded innocent and is free on $5,000 bail.
   O'Ferrell said that he has made copies of court documents at
Fleming's print shop but that he doesn't know Fleming well.
   Killed in the December bomb attacks were Judge Robert Vance of
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and civil rights attorney
Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga. Bombs were also mailed to the 11th
Circuit headquarters in Atlanta and an NAACP chapter in
Jacksonville, Fla., but did not explode.
   A much-coveted clue is the typewriter used to write a letter,
signed ``Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System,''
claiming responsibility for the bombs and threatening more
violence. The FBI has searched pawn shops, O'Ferrell's store, a
septic tank, a lake, schools, a trash dump and Fort Rucker for the
typewriter but apparently has not found it.
   Federal sources have said the letter, received in December by an
Atlanta TV station, appeared to have been written on the same
typewriter as a document O'Ferrell prepared in 1988 in a case
before the 11th Circuit.
   Vance sat on a panel that ruled against O'Ferrell when O'Ferrell
sued his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance Co., in an employment
compensation case. In a legal brief he prepared while acting as his
own attorney, O'Ferrell called the judicial system corrupt.
   FBI officials are quick to note that the investigation is
continuing full-scale in other cities, notably Atlanta.
   But it is Enterprise, a pleasant, growth-conscious city of about
20,000, that is receiving most of the attention. Until the agents
moved in, the town was best known for a 10-foot monument of a boll
weevil.
   Holding court from behind the cash register at his junk shop or
atop its loading dock, O'Ferrell, a 46-year-old part-time preacher,
dispenses small-town wisdom and proclaims his innocence several
times daily.
   ``Two people know I'm innocent,'' he often says. ``Me and
Jesus.''
   Visitors have been impressed by O'Ferrell's calmness in the wake
of such scrutiny. Pressed, however, he acknowledges the spotlight
has bothered his family. If he is cleared, O'Ferrell said last
week, he expects an apology from the government.
   ``They can't pay me for what they've done to me,'' O'Ferrell
said. ``They don't have that kind of money.''
   At times, more than 100 agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and the Postal Inspection Service have worked
on the investigation.
   Federal authorities defend the numbers, even though they have
not produced an arrest.
   ``A hundred agents on a case like this? That's not overkill,''
Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said. ``In law
enforcement you always should err on the side of having more than
enough troops rather than a shortage.''

   When Don had a tough day at the office
he didn't unwind at the health club or corner bar.
   ``I'd go to a store and steal,'' said the highly paid engineer,
who sought counseling last year to end his 20-year spree of thefts.
``It was my release. I was good at it and it didn't take much
time.''
   But the ``middle-class look'' that Don credits with helping him
avoid the suspicions of store detectives is becoming less of an
armor as retailers and security industry executives try new tactics
in the war on shoplifting.
   Don, who spoke on condition his name not be used, told his story
Friday at a conference of retail and security executives seeking to
gain an edge.
   Shoplifting has risen 35 percent since the mid-1980s and now
equals about 2 percent of all U.S. retail sales excluding gas and
car purchases. Conference speakers said high-technology
surveillance and psychological methods will probably lead the
battle to reverse the trend.
   In the 1960s, Deerfield Beach-based Sensormatic Electronics
Corp., the conference sponsor, developed the plastic tags that hang
on many store garments today. Recently, the company introduced tags
that sound an alarm if tampered with. Other projects include a
surveillance camera that simultaneously monitors the cash register
and sales clerk.
   Some stores have tried mixing background music with barely
audible voices _ so-called subliminal messages _ stressing honesty
and anti-theft themes. And, experts say, cameras programmed to
watch for known shoplifters may someday be used.
   ``It would be programmed to recognize face patterns and analyze
the customers as they walk in,'' said Bob McCrie, editor of the New
York-based publication Security Letter. ``These are the type of
things that are coming.''
   Don epitomized one of the conference's themes: Shoplifters range
from the impoverished to the elite and often steal simply for the
emotional high.
   Don figures that before he sought counseling in May, he stole
more than $160,000 worth of merchandise _ much of which he threw
away _ with only 47 apprehensions and nine prosecutions. He once
spent 14 days in jail on paid vacation from work.
   ``Who would suspect me? I had that middle-class look,'' he said.
``If you feel comfortable in a store, you become a wrecking ball
and could take anything you wanted.''
   Peter Berlin, a former department store security chief who runs
Shoplifters Anonymous in Jericho, N.Y., said, ``There is no profile
of shoplifters. I've caught them all: nuns, policemen, attorneys.
It doesn't matter.''
   An estimated 20 million Americans steal from a store at least
once a year, said Berlin. Yet the thief is caught only about one in
50 times.
   Theft is also a greater concern among retailers now because
increased competition and low inflation keep stores from simply
raising prices to cover losses, called ``inventory shrinkage'' in
the retail vernacular.
   Shoplifting is still mostly committed by women, although crack
addicts of both sexes have turned to stealing to support their
habits, conference participants said.
   McCrie said a 1981 study in Spokane, Wash., found 59 percent of
shoplifters were women, mostly in their teens or 20s. The study
also concluded divorced, separated or widowed women are more likely
to shoplift.
   ``Many people see shoplifting as a substitute for gratification
of unmet needs,'' said McCrie. ``They could be personal,
psychological, revenge _ any number of things.''
   Only 4 percent of shoplifters are diagnosed as true
kleptomaniacs with an obsessive desire to steal, he said.
   Berlin said studies indicate between 1.5 percent and 3 percent
of all shoppers may attempt to shoplift. But he found the rate rose
to about 6 percent in department store costume jewelry sections.
   Berlin also said employee theft has become an increasing problem
because of lower hiring standards and the takeover mania of the
1980s that reduced job security.
   ``There's a feeling that, `I better take care of myself because
nobody else will,' and they are not wrong,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Will Propose Eliminating Communist Monopoly on Power,
Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will ask the
Communist Party leadership to break its seven-decade hammerlock on
power and accept the possibility of competing political parties, a
Soviet news agency said Saturday.
   The report also said the Soviet leader would propose a complete
change in the party structure and tacitly endorse the concept of
private ownership.
   The stunning disclosures came just two days before a party
Central Committee meeting that is expected to be a forum on the
future course of the nation and probably the most crucial test of
Gorbachev's five years in power.
   If Gorbachev does indeed ask the party to break its monopoly on
power, and the increasingly splintered party leadership agrees, it
could thrust the superpower into a cycle of change that already is
being played out on a smaller scale throughout the East bloc.
   A bitter fight over reform in expected at the closed-door
Central Committee meeting on Monday and Tuesday. Progressives are
calling for a multiparty system and a virtual apology for decades
of dictatorship.
   Diehard Communists want to retain their lock on power and keep
central planning and collective farming, which have brought the
country to economic ruin.
   This is likely the last Central Committee meeting before local
and republic elections in the coming weeks, where hard-liners could
suffer humiliating defeats as did many of their colleagues last
spring, when the nation held its first competitive elections.
   The Soviet news agency Interfax says Gorbachev wants to trim the
Central Committee from 251 members to 200, which could jeopardize
the votes of many hard-liners in the key policy-making body.
   Gorbachev, as usual, has placed himself squarely in the middle,
according to the Interfax report.
   He is proposing a new Communist Party platform where ``the
multiparty principle is not rejected, but is not treated as a
panacea,'' reported Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow.
   The platform says the party ``will fight for its leading role,
but assume no state or government powers, nor lay any claim to
having its role set down in the Constitution,'' Interfax said.
   An attempt to remove the Communists' guarantee of supremacy
inscribed in the Soviet Constitution failed during the December
session of parliament.
   The Soviet Union, ruled exclusively by the Communists since a
few months after the 1917 Russian Revolution, is the last remaining
Warsaw Pact nation to give the Communists a guaranteed monopoly on
power.
   Gorbachev's nurturing of greater social freedoms sparked the
changes in the East bloc, but the pace of reform in those nations
have quickly outraced change in the Soviet Union, overhauling the
ideological landscape of Eastern Europe.
   Interfax also said Gorbachev's platform does not reject the
concept of private ownership, but did not say if that includes
ownership of land and businesses by individuals.
   The Central Committee is expected to vote on the platform, for
presentation to a full party congress of about 5,000 delegates
scheduled for October. Tass said Saturday some party members have
suggested holding the party congress earlier, in two parts, with
local party elections between the two sessions.
   The fight in the Soviet Communist Party comes at a time of
stunningly rapid change. Since the Central Committee last met six
weeks ago:
   _ The Communist split has come into the open, with reformers
threatening to form their own party if changes are not made.
   _ The Soviet Union itself tumbled closer to fracturing with open
rebellion in Azerbaijan, and peaceful independence movements in the
Baltics, particularly in Lithuania, where Gorbachev promised the
people a choice on secession.
   _ In four countries of Eastern Europe, the price paid by
Communist hard-liners has risen. Men who fell from power in the
autumn are now being arrested. Only in Poland and Hungary, where
reform has come most gradually, are former dictators still free.
   The Soviet press, too, has been full of portents of political
change. A letter to the editor of Pravda suggested, ``The Communist
idea is dead,'' while Moscow News reported suggestions the party be
disbanded.
   Economic deprivation only worsens with each passing day as more
daily necessities disappear from store shelves.
   ``It has become increasingly difficult to prove that an American
worker with $2,000 a month in wages is suffering from exploitation,
while his Soviet counterpart enjoys its absence with an income of
237 rubles ($395) a month,'' said Pravda this week.
   Gorbachev heads into Monday's showdown strengthened by the
world's horrified reaction to a broadcast report that he might
resign as party chief, and by a series of disgraces suffered
recently by hard-liners.
   Gorbachev denied the report of his possible resignation after
letting the world stew for 12 hours.
   Izvestia ran a front-page article Friday noting the report had
already had its effect in Washington, where a cut in American
military troops in Europe had just been proposed.
   Progressives and even ordinary citizens sick of shortages
worried that the alternative to Gorbachev would be far worse.
   The Interfax report also says Gorbachev is proposing a new party
structure, with an elected chairman and two deputy chairmen.
   However, Tass on Saturday said individual party members have
suggested that delegates to the party congress, which would
formally adopt the new platform, should be chosen in direct
elections from the district level.
   The Interfax report also says the Gorbachev platform calls for a
new executive committee that would include representatives of the
15 republics. It was not clear if this would replace the current
Politburo.
   The party's rules of unity and secrecy, already being broken,
could be eased under the various proposals. The Gorbachev plan
would permit minority viewpoints but not formal factions inside the
party, Interfax said.
   In a strong hint of impending demotions, Tass said Saturday the
many rank-and-file Communists blame the Central Committee for the
slow pace of reform.

   With a single stunning speech,
President F.W. de Klerk has set South Africa on the road to a new
future after decades of racial confrontation and white domination.
   De Klerk repudiated the white supremacist principles that guided
his ruling National Party for decades and cleared the way for
blacks _ including Communists and guerrilla leaders _ to take part
in political life.
   ``The aim is a totally new and just constitutional dispensation
in which every inhabitant will enjoy equal rights, treatment and
opportunity in every sphere,'' he told the nation at the opening of
Parliament on Friday.
   In a speech that would have been unthinkable one or two years
ago, the president ended bans on the African National Congress and
other anti-apartheid groups that have waged a 30-year guerrilla
struggle against white minority rule, repealed many repressive
regulations and promised to end the state of emergency used to
stifle dissent.
   The speech was a remarkable change for a party that created
apartheid to permanently exclude blacks from power. H.F. Verwoerd,
a former prime minister and the architect of apartheid, set the
tone for Nationalist rule when he said in 1961: ``When I talk of
the nation of South Africa, I talk to the white people of South
Africa.''
   De Klerk warned that the quest for a peaceful solution would not
be easy and the country would face many challenges. He appealed to
all South Africans to work with him.
   Government leaders and their opponents agree that nobody knows
just how to solve the country's problems.
   In a front page editorial Saturday hailing de Klerk's reforms,
The Cape Times newspaper said, ``We have now entered a more
dangerous phase of the inevitable process of change, where the
situation is going to be much more volatile... ''
   De Klerk deliberately avoided many major questions facing South
Africa, including the extent to which the government is willing to
share power with blacks and the pace at which it will make reforms.
   In the past, de Klerk has said he opposes black majority rule _
the main goal of all anti-apartheid groups, which say they will not
accept anything but full democracy with no special status for any
ethnic group.
   Apartheid sets up a racially segregated society in which South
Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate housing,
schools and health services.
   Major pillars of apartheid, such as laws segregating residential
areas and public amenities, remain in force. Power and wealth are
overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of whites.
   Government ministers declined to say when apartheid laws would
be abolished, saying such changes would have to be negotiated. But
de Klerk promised that the Separate Amenities Act, which allows
local governments to segregate public facilities, would be repealed
during the current session of Parliament.
   While most anti-apartheid leaders hailed de Klerk's initiative,
they warned that the government had not gone far enough.
   Exiled ANC leaders welcomed the reforms, but said there could be
no instant peace.
   ``An armistice can only take place once a democratic government
is in place,'' said an ANC spokesman.
   Denis Worrall, leader of the white liberal Democratic Party,
said the search for a political solution could resemble the
tortured quest for peace in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
   The government is not in danger of collapsing, and de Klerk is
offering to negotiate from a powerful position. The government is
in full control of the country, black resistance is minimal, and
the ANC has admitted its guerrilla campaign has been largely
ineffectual.
   The biggest obstacle facing de Klerk and his allies may be white
opposition.
   De Klerk, as leader of the white Afrikaners of Dutch descent who
dominate South African politics, must maintain substantial white
support as he attempts to work out a solution. Government leaders
have expressed concern about a terroist campaign by white
extremists.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, reacted with fury to de Klerk's plans and demanded an
immediate general election. ``We say he has no mandate for doing
the drastic things he intends doing,'' the leader of the main white
opposition party said.
   De Klerk will have to persuade whites to accept change,
overcoming centuries of ingrained conviction of white superiority
and privilege. Most political observers say the president does not
have much time to change the hearts and minds of whites if he is to
maintain his momentum.
   There is little sign that most whites are ready to share
schools, hospitals and other amenities with blacks or to accept a
division of wealth and opportunity with the masses of poor blacks.
   Many whites reacted to de Klerk's speech with caution and
concern. Some whites expressed fears about their future and safety
in a black majority state.
   ``Whites are feeling a bit insecure. There is reservation in the
hearts of whites,'' said one white businessman after hearing de
Klerk's speech.
   De Klerk has gained respect and time from many South Africans
who hope he will now lead them to the peaceful solution he has
promised. The question, he acknowledges, is whether that time and
support will be adequate to forge a solution acceptable to the
majority.

   Five ethnic Albanian groups on
Saturday asked the government to investigate reports that police
fired without warning on protesters in Kosovo province, where
unrest has killed 25 people and injured 120.
   About 300 ethnic Albanians chanting ``Democracy! Democracy!''
rallied Saturday in the town of Podujevo, and a smaller group was
dispersed by riot police in the provincial capital of Pristina, 20
miles to the south.
   A government statement, however, said there were ``visible
signs'' that the situation was calming down in Kosovo. Thousands of
police backed by tanks and planes maintained patrols in the
southern province.
   The ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo has demanded increased
autonomy from the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, Serbia,
which said it tightened control over the province last year to
protect the Serbian minority from harassment.
   More than 100,000 Kosovo residents have signed a petition
calling for an end to the year-old state of emergency and for
democratic elections, said Veton Surroi, head of the regional
chapter of the Yugoslav Union for Democratic Initiative. The
petition also called for an end to the violence.
   In an English-language statement, the five ethnic Albanian
groups said they supported the government's attempt to resolve the
unrest and asked for talks.
   A statement urged the government to investigate reports that
police fired without cause or warning several times in the past
week, killing people in several villages.
   It said authorities used ``classic forms of state terrorism'' to
put down ethnic Albanian calls for greater autonomy from Serbia.
   It demanded ``an immediate ban on the use of lethal firearms by
police, establishing a commission to investigate all alleged
murders as a way to defuse the explosive situation that threatens
to turn into a bloody civil war.''
   On Friday, President Janez Drnovsek appealed to ethnic Albanians
and Serbs in the province to stop the violence, which he said
threatened the process of economic and political reform nationwide.
   The government has pledged to allow a multiparty democracy and
observe human rights according to internationally recognized
standards.
   Drnovsek has said that the use of arms is in no group's interest
and has repeatedly called for a dialogue.
   But officials of Serbia, who accuse the ethnic Albanians of
wanting to secede from Yugoslavia and join neighboring Albania,
have demanded that opposition leaders first renounce any such
intention before talks can begin.
   Yugoslavia's liberal northern regions of Slovenia and Croatia
have backed ethnic Albanian calls for greater self-government and
blamed the unrest on Serbian moves, backed by nationalist Serbian
leader Sloboban Milosevic, to reduce the province's autonomy.
   On Saturday, the official Tanjug news agency said 25 ethnic
Albanians have died over the past 11 days of protests. It did not
report any new deaths overnight, however, and there was no
explanation for the increase in the official death toll from 21 on
Thursday.
   In addition, 75 demonstrators and 45 riot policemen were injured
in the clashes, the agency said, citing official sources.
   The groups that made the statement were the Kosovo branch of the
Yugoslav Union for Democratic Initiative, the Committee for Human
Rights and Freedoms, the Democratic League of Kosova, the Society
of Philosophers and Sociologists of Kosova, and the Initiating
Board for the Youth Parliament. Kosova is the name Albanians use to
refer to the province.

<HEAD>Billie Sol Estes Files for Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billie Sol Estes, a confidant of Lyndon
Johnson who went to prison for a fertilizer-tank scam in the 1960s,
has filed for bankruptcy, claiming debts of $52 million and assets
of just $150.
   The Chapter 7 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court came after the
flim-flam artist's indictment last year on charges of plotting to
manufacture container cargo trailers with trade secrets stolen from
another company. He is free on $10,000 bail.
   Estes, 64, and his wife, Patsy, cited debts that include $50
million in back taxes and interest, said his attorney, Charles
McDonald.
   ``This could get Uncle Sam off his back,'' McDonald said Friday.
Under Chapter 7, assets are liquidated to pay off creditors.
   Estes reported a monthly income of $700, from Social Security, a
far cry from the days when the agricultural tycoon's personal
fortune was estimated as high as $400 million.
   In court papers Estes noted his only activity as ``sewing in
home for Patsy.''
   Estes was convicted in 1963 in a multimillion-dollar swindle
involving non-existent fertilizer tanks backed by federal
agriculture loans. He went to prison in 1965 and was paroled in
1971.
   He went back to prison in 1979 for fraud. On the eve of his
release in 1983, Estes said, ``I'm just one drink away from being a
drunk and just one deal away from being back in prison.''

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Firing of Man Who Used Ladies' Room Before Sex

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that Boeing Co. took reasonable
steps to accommodate a software engineer who was preparing for a
sex-change operation before it fired him for wearing a necklace and
using the women's bathroom.
   Superior Court Judge Fred Rasmussen affirmed Friday that state
law banning discrimination against the handicapped applied to the
former employee's psychosexual condition, known as gender
dysphoria, or transsexualism.
   But the judge found no discrimination by Boeing against the
plaintiff, who is now a woman.
   The American Civil Liberties Union represented the 34-year-old
woman, known to the court as Jane Doe, who was employed by Boeing
Computer Services as a male from 1978 to 1985. The former employee
underwent a sex change operation in 1988.
   The lawsuit, the first of its kind in the state, accused the
company of discriminating against Doe because of her physical and
mental handicap and of refusing to provide any reasonable
accommodation for her disability.
   Doe was fired in 1985 for wearing a strand of pink imitation
pearls. Doe's former Boeing Computer Services supervisor testified
during the trial that the jewelry made Doe's attire unacceptable
and disruptive to co-workers.
   Further testimony showed that Doe had been warned not to wear
the pearls but had been allowed to wear a bra, stockings, earrings
and makeup.
   Doe admitted in testimony that she violated the dress code and
women's restroom restriction but did it to ``push'' the company.
She said Boeing had no right to set any dress code or bar her from
the ladies' bathroom.
   She said her doctor and therapist had told her she needed to
live and act as a woman full time before undergoing sex-change
surgery.
   However, the judge ruled that Boeing had the right to require
Doe to wear sex-neutral clothing. He also pointed out that Doe
intentionally violated the company dress code and prohibition
against using the women's restroom.
   The judge also pointed out that the employee's doctor and
therapist also told her that compromise was needed and that she
didn't have to violate the dress code.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said during the trial that Boeing
believed the claim did not represent a handicap under the classic
definition and that the company tried to accommodate the employee
prior to sex-change surgery.

<HEAD>Assaults, Thefts Prompt Churches to Hire Guards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two downtown churches still ask God to watch over
them, but parishioners feel better that there are armed guards on
hand, too.
   Burglaries, assaults and car vandalism have driven the churches
to hire off-duty police officers or sheriff's deputies to watch
churchgoers and their cars on weekends.
   ``There has been a generalized sigh of relief,'' said the Rev.
Jim Barnes, pastor at Trinity United Methodist Church, which began
using officers in November after suffering break-ins and the theft
of cars from a parking lot nearby.
   ``People don't want to come downtown if they think their cars
are going to be stolen. So we decided to bite the bullet, pardon
the phrase, and do it.''
   Most downtown pastors have stories to tell of assaults, threats
and vandalism, and the occasional mentally disturbed or drunken
person who interrupts services.
   The Rev. C.B. Woodrich, pastor of Holy Ghost Roman Catholic
Church, which has employed guards for years, calls it ``just part
of doing business downtown. It was getting to the point that
everyone was being scared away.''
   Armed guards at Holy Ghost sometimes walk women and older people
to their cars. The church spends roughly $150 a weekend on the
guards, Woodrich said.
   Other churches are using guards, but not armed ones.
   St. John's Episcopal Church hires two unarmed security guards to
patrol parking lots on Sundays. ``There is just some crazy thing
with me _ I don't want weapons on the church grounds,'' said Dean
Donald McPhail.
   Jim Burris, business manager for the Basilica of the Immaculate
Conception, said the church took its cue from Holy Ghost when it
began hiring sheriff's deputies in December. The officers are
uniformed but are not armed.
   ``It kind of adds to the peace of mind of people coming to
church,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
flatly rejected on Saturday a Soviet proposal that Americans,
Canadians and Europeans vote on whether a united Germany should be
allowed.
   Kohl spoke with reporters after a one-hour meeting with
Communist Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany that focused on the
economic crisis caused by the exodus of East Germans to the West.
   ``The main topic was that both of us stressed once again the
exceptional seriousness of the situation, as the number of migrants
remains high _ about 55,000 in January,'' Kohl told reporters.
   Modrow said they discussed intra-German relations ahead of his
Feb. 13-14 visit to Bonn.
   Neither official disclosed details of the talks held in this
resort, where both were attending an international business forum.
   Kohl said signs of economic collapse had increased in East
Germany. ``It must be our common concern to stop this process,'' he
said.
   The chancellor said the talks did not touch on Modrow's
four-point plan for a united but militarily neutral Germany,
unveiled Thursday. Bonn had immediately rejected the neutrality
idea.
   Kohl was asked about Soviet Foreign Eduard Shevardnadze's
proposal that Europeans, Americans and Canadians vote to decide
whether East and West Germany should merge because they had
suffered so much in World War II.
   ``I don't support that because this is a truly German issue,''
Kohl replied. Europeans would back German unity in any case, he
added.
   Shevardnadze made the suggestion in an interview with Soviet
reporters published Friday. At the same time, he gave the Kremlin's
strongest endorsement yet to German unification, while repeating
conditions that this must not destabilize Europe or occur too
quickly.
   At the annual Davos business forum, West Germany's economics
minister, Helmut Haussmann, counseled caution in proceeding with
economic and monetary ties between the two Germanys.
   He said talks about the relation between the two countries'
currencies will have to wait until after the East German elections,
scheduled for March 18.
   Haussmann was responding to comments at the conference by
Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer, a popular reformer who quit East
Germany's Communist Party last month. On Friday, Berghofer
described the situation in East Germany in dire terms.
   An average of 2,000 East Germans are fleeing their country daily
for their more affluent neighbor. The exodus is draining East
Germany of skilled workers and straining West German social
services.
   Berghofer said complete collapse is imminent unless workers are
given a convertible currency this year and the steady flood of
people leaving the country is stopped.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Friday suggested
circulating his country's currency in East Germany to prop up the
failing economy.
   Modrow and Kohl have proposed a common currency as one of the
steps toward unification.
   In a speech earlier Saturday, Kohl sought to defuse Soviet
worries about the revival of a strong Germany at the heart of
Europe. He reiterated his stand that a united Germany should be
achieved within ``security structures in Europe spanning both
alliances,'' at lower levels of armament.
   He said the Western alliance, while it must adapt to changes in
the Warsaw Pact, ``remains indispensable'' and includes a
``substantial security role for the United States on our
continent.''
   Kohl called for increased Western investment in the reforming
economies of Eastern Europe, provided they guarantee free-market
principles by law.
   He said an overwhelming majority of Germans want unity.
   West Germany will respect the decision of East Germans in any
referendum on unification, he said. ``But I have no doubt what it
will be.''

his mother went to check on him, they said.
   The children heard a shotgun blast and their mother walked into

outside and waited for police, she said.
   Officers said the boy told them, ``She was nagging me, and I

   Long-silenced activists began
speaking out and thousands of blacks marched in celebration
Saturday after President F.W. de Klerk scrapped stifling
restrictions on anti-apartheid groups.
   A newspaper report, meanwhile, said jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela could be freed within a week.
   But de Klerk's decision to legalize the African National
Congress and lift a host of other restrictions brought an
outpouring of activism elsewhere.
   Large crowds marched in the streets of Port Elizabeth, the
northern Cape province desert town of Graaf-Reinet, and Alexandra,
a small township next to Johannesburg. About 7,000 people protested
the appearance of a visiting English cricket team in
Pietermaritzburg, the Natal provincial capital.
   The African National Congress, meanwhile, said its guerrilla
attacks would not be suspended but would have a lower profile.
   ``I think one can expect, in the context of the legalization of
the ANC, that probably other aspects of our multipronged strategy
will receive a much higher profile than in the past,'' said Pallo
Jordan, the ANC's information chief at its exile headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia.
   Jordan was one of several ANC leaders who could not be quoted in
South Africa until Saturday, when notices were published in the
Government Gazette, formalizing the stunning concessions announced
by de Klerk on Friday.
   The government repealed laws that banned 175 people, including
ANC President Oliver Tambo, now recovering from a stroke in Sweden;
the ANC's chief spokesman, Tom Sebina; and the leader of the South
African Communist Party, Joe Slovo.
   It removed state-of-emergency prohibitions on travel and public
speaking on another 200 people.
   Among those reveling in their new freedoms was 84-year-old Helen
Joseph, the first white person ever placed under house arrest for
anti-government activity.
   She had been officially ``banned,'' restricted to the
Johannesburg area, placed under curfew in her home, and prohibited
from meeting with more than a few people at a time or making public
appearances. For the first time in 30 years, South African
newspapers published her comments Saturday.
   ``This is a wonderful day. I am very excited about my personal
freedom since I am no longer a listed person,'' said the
wheelchair-bound activist, an old friend of Mandela's.
   ``Above all I am excited about the return of all my friends and
comrades and all the exiles who will be coming back home, all my
comrades who will be released from jail,'' she was quoted as saying.
   De Klerk, in his speech to Parliament, also said that Mandela
would be freed soon.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, quoted an unidentified
government source as saying de Klerk ``moves very fast'' and could
free the 71-year-old Mandela any day.
   ``If there is no sudden outbreak of violence and people react in
an orderly fashion, Mr. Mandela could be free by next weekend,''
the source was quoted as saying.
   De Klerk's announcements met most of the conditions laid down by
the ANC to begin negotiations on a new constitution to bring the
black majority into the nation's political life.
   However, many activists said the government must completely end
the state of emergency, free all prisoners convicted of crimes
related to political action and repeal laws that still would allow
the arrest of returning exiles.
   Senior leaders of the ANC, most of them banned until this
weekend, gathered for an executive meeting Saturday in Stockholm,
Sweden.
   ``The ANC will discuss new strategies because of the new
situation which has arisen,'' said David Kgabang, an ANC official
in the Stockholm office.
   De Klerk announced a moratorium on executions and ended most
emergency restrictions on the press, while allowing police to
retain control over photography and filming of political unrest and
police actions.
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, who had been prevented for two years from
editing his newspaper, New Nation, was free to work and speak. His
paper carried front-page color illustrations of the ANC and
Communist Party flags in a special issue Saturday.
   Reaction to de Klerk's concessions in most black townships was
subdued, with no celebrations in the largest black city, Soweto,
home to 2.5 million people.
   But almost half the population of the small desert town of
Graaf-Reinet, walked under ANC banners from outlying mixed-race and
black townships to the town center Saturday.
   Mayor Joan Thornton accepted letters of complaint from leaders
of the 15,000 marchers about lack of electricity and sewage
systems, and a shortage of housing and water taps. She handed the
leaders a white rose ``as a symbol of peace in this town,'' 560
miles north of Cape Town.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, mixed-race president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches, said the mayor's action was ``an
enormous recognition of the movement and the respect with which
they must behold the movement now that we can bring so many
thousands of people peacefully into a town like this.''
   About 8,000 people, including many elders and children, crammed
into a stadium in Alexandra, a township of more than 100,000 people
near Johannesburg, and chanted ``Viva ANC'' while swaying to the
rhythm of liberation songs.
   The Alexandra rally originally had been scheduled to protest
living conditions in the squalid township, and the crowd doubled as
the protesters marched to the local council office and police
station.
   In Port Elizabeth townships in the eastern Cape province,
several thousand people danced in the streets, and blacks in pubs
praised de Klerk as ``bold and brave,'' said a report from the
South African Press Association. About 150 blacks marched and sang
briefly in downtown Johannesburg.
   The focus of the 7,000 people gathered in Pietermaritzburg was
the cricket tour, which violates an international sports boycott
against South Africa.
   English captain Mike Gatting and Ali Bacher, general manager of
the South African Cricket Union, walked through a 100-yard gantlet
of chanting protesters to collect a petition from the organizers.
As they returned members of the crowd threw stones and soft drink
cans at them, until volunteer marshals stopped the abuse. No
injuries were reported.

   Atlantis' five astronauts completed
a countdown rehearsal inside the shuttle Saturday for their
classified military mission later this month.
   As planned, the test ended five seconds before the clock reached
zero to simulate an aborted liftoff in which the three main engines
shut down after ignition.
   ``Everything went according to plan,'' said NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone.
   Atlantis is scheduled to lift off Feb. 22. Sources close to the
project said the crew will put into orbit a spy satellite that will
gather information over the Soviet Union and elsewhere.
   The space agency said the flight could be pushed back a day or
so because of a problem with a main engine turboprop, which
engineers are replacing. A firm launch date will be set Feb. 10.

   The eighth-grade history class at Stephen
Decatur Middle School had taken on the competitive feel of a
television game show.
   ``Name the King of England who wanted to move away from the
Catholic church and wanted to establish his own church,''
challenged teacher Georgia Runfola.
   ``I know, I know,'' yelled a student, swiftly flipping through a
textbook. ``Henry the Eighth.''
   ``Good job,'' responded special education teacher Brenda Morris.
   Runfola and Morris are team teachers, participants in a program
in this Prince Georges County school designated to further the
``mainstreaming'' of students with mild learning disabilities into
regular classroom environments.
   Only the teachers know which students have learning disabilities.
   ``You don't make a distinction in the classroom,'' said Dawn
DeTurris, another team teacher. ``Teachers put the roll in
alphabetical order and then they soon forget, hopefully. They try
to meet the needs of all students as they come up, whether they
have a handicapping condition or not.''
   The program at Stephen Decatur is one of many efforts nationwide
to help children with special educational needs, a group that is
drawing increased attention just a few miles away in the nation's
capital.
   The Supreme Court recently let stand a ruling that all
handicapped children, even those lacking any learning ability, are
entitled to education paid for by the public schools.
   President Bush, who pledged during the campaign to be the
``education president,'' has promised to educate all of America's
children.
   David Chavkin of the National Center for Clinical Infant
Programs said about 4.1 million children classified as mentally or
physically handicapped are being educated in federally assisted
education programs. These include more than 1.5 million children
with specific learning disabilities, more than 1 million with
speech impairments, nearly 1 million mentally retarded, more than
300,000 with serious emotional disturbances, and more than 300,000
with orthopedic impairments, with vision or hearing impairments,
and with other health impairments, or with multiple disabilities.
   For the current 1990 fiscal year, the Education Department's
budget for special education and rehabilitative services programs
is about $4 billion. Education for handicapped children cost the
nation's schools $16 billion last year.
   An example of how that budget leaches down to the local level is
in Prince Georges County. The head of the program, Robert Coombs,
describes it as ``highly respected and well-known.''
   In Prince Georges, 1,200 teachers, instructional aides,
therapists and middle managers handle about 11,000 special
education students. The county's budget for the current school year
is $53 million, with only about $3 million from the federal
government.
   Coombs said the program allows special education to move away
from a ``mini, one-room schoolhouse environment.''
   ``The nice part about this is if you are a multi-level student
who just can't make it in math but do pretty well in everything
else, we can `pull' that student for intensive work in math only
and keep him mainstreamed for all the other subjects,'' said Coombs.
   Although the students' anonymity is broken that way, Coombs and
others said the benefits of the special work are great.
   About 135 of the 800 students at Stephen Decatur are special
education students, most of them coming from six different areas of
the county. The middle school is one of three in the county with an
entire wing of the building for special education students. Mildly
handicapped students can receive either periodic monitoring with no
direct service or up to at least 20 hours of special education
service, depending on need.
   Students ``pulled out'' from the regular class receive separate
instructions in ``intensive resource'' classes that have
student-teacher ratios as low as 7-to-1. The average class size is
about a dozen students.
   Combs explained, ``One of the things you run into in secondary
schools that enroll mildly handicapped kids is they get very
resistant to being labeled as different than all the other
students.''
   ``They don't like that and they don't like to be pulled out and
have to go down the hall'' for separate classes that focus on their
special needs.
   Students with severe learning disabilities are taught in
so-called ``self-contained units'' and do not attend classes with
regular students, said Coombs.
   ``Special education students get individualized instruction when
necessary,'' said Dawn Thigpen, who oversees special education
programs at several of the county's middle school. ``The teams work
very hard with parents to make sure the student is placed in the
least restrictive environment.''
   Ms. Thigpen said that team teaching is a favorite and teachers
have developed a variety of strategies.
   For example, the teachers try to divide up the course work
according to the strengths and weaknesses, or likes and dislikes,
with each taking turns to lead class work during a period. In other
teams, one teacher will take over the classroom on one day and the
other teacher the next day.
   ``What is neat is that you can meet the needs of regular
education students as well as the needs of students who have
handicapping conditions,'' said Joan Harris, an English and reading
team teacher.
   Teacher Kathy Doyle added: ``With two people, you can do a lot
of proactive behavior management, where you defuse a behavior
problem before it starts. ... You can have one teacher take a child
out of the classroom before he affects the others.''
   One drawback to the approach, volunteered one eighth grader,
comes ``when the teachers both talk at once. I get confused.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign aid, once a backwater issue that
stirred relatively little interest on Capitol Hill, has become a
hot topic with lawmakers asking the Bush administration: Where's
the dough?
   Pressing domestic needs, changes in Eastern Europe, the invasion
of Panama and a controversial proposal by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., to
slash funds to Israel and Egypt are spotlighting foreign aid in
1990.
   Noting the general unpopularity of foreign aid, Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said ``There's going to be
some rough sledding.''
   A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll showed 71 percent of
Americans believe the United States spends too much on foreign aid.
They supported aid, but were virtually split on helping Poland and
opposed aid to East Germany and the Soviet Union.
   Many lawmakers, including Sen. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., a member of
the Senate committee that divvies up foreign aid, and Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House foreign operations
appropriations subcommittee, view cuts in defense _ the so-called
peace dividend _ as the future cash cow for foreign aid.
   ``We can easily cut another $10 billion to $18 billion (from
defense spending) without jeopardizing security,'' says Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
``There's a lot more to be done within the Defense Department.''
   Biden is one of a handful of Democratic senators who introduced
a bill last week to channel $500 million to Eastern Europe.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said the defense budget should be
cut in favor of foreign aid. ``There are times to buy bullets and
times for other things,'' he said.
   Lawmakers said they've been told funds will be taken from
defense programs and from other accounts.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
subcommittee that handles foreign aid, says he wants to see the
money first.
   ``I told one administration official, `Don't travel around the
world saying, `The check's in the mail,' when I have the checkbook
in my pocket.''
   ``I'm not going to move a bill that makes great promises without
the money,'' Leahy said.
   While the Bush administration last week asked for $14.8 billion
in foreign aid for fiscal 1991, about $1 billion over the previous
year, Congress still has unfinished business for fiscal year 1990,
which began last October.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has informed lawmakers the
administration is planning to ask Congress for two supplemental
foreign aid packages for 1990, but he hasn't told them where he
wants to cut money so the budget will balance.
   The packages are $500 million for Panama to help the country the
United States invaded on Dec. 20, and $70 million for refugees.
   The State Department's refugee budget has been strained by the
Soviet Union's liberalized emigration policies that have allowed
more people, particularly Jews, to leave. The administration wants
to admit 27,000 more refugees this year.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., says $30 million is to be siphoned off
from Sudan and Somalia. But Simon, chairman of a Senate Africa
subcommittee, says he's opposed to eliminating money for Africa.
   Leonard H. Robinson Jr., chairman of the African Development
Bank, complained in an op-ed piece in The Washington Post that
Africa, the world's poorest continent, has been given short-shrift.
   ``Where did the $900 million come from?'' he asked about the
money Congress provided for Poland and Hungary late last year.
``Why did it take only days to secure? As an Africanist, I want to
know _ so do the people of Africa.''
   Others are sure to come forward with complaints about Congress'
habit of ``earmarking'' _ setting aside _ money for specific
countries. The administration opposes such earmarks, saying they
eliminate flexibility.
   Five countries _ Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines and
Pakistan _ receive more than two-thirds of the total aid. Israel
and Egypt get the lion's share, with Israel leading at $3 billion.
Egypt is slated to get $2.2 billion.
   Dole's proposal to eliminate _ as well as reduce money for
Israel _ has gained little public support from his colleagues, but
it has raised the sensitive issue for debate this year. Dole wants
more money sent to Eastern Europe.
   Aid to Israel is always delicate because of its ramifications
with the American Jewish community.
   ``I don't support Senator Dole's proposal, although I think he
has performed a service by calling attention to the need for
reconsideration of the allocation of our resources for foreign
aid,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the Dole plan was a ``bad idea.''
A group of House members led by Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., said aid
to the Middle Eastern nations is ``an investment ... not a gift.''
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., predicted the Dole plan will
come to the forefront in ``two to six months, but it's not
something the administration wants to take the heat over right
now.''
   Another contentious topic is El Salvador, where some members of
Congress have suggested tying U.S. aid to country's human rights
record. The administration has reduced economic aid to El Salvador
to $130 million in 1990, but proposes to increase that in 1991.
   One senator with little interest in foreign aid in Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   ``I ain't got no dog in that fight,'' Helms said of the Dole
proposal. Helms said he has opposed all foreign aid.
   ``What are we doing giving away money when we have such a debt
problem at home?'' he said.

   The African National Congress held its
first meeting as a legal entity Saturday and a spokesman said the
group will not abandon its guerrilla campaign despite concessions
made by the South African goverment.
   ANC leaders flew in from their headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia,
to join veteran members recently released from South African
prisons who were in Sweden to visit ailing ANC President Oliver
Tambo.
   On Friday, the ANC issued a statement from Stockholm cautiously
welcoming the dramatic policy changes announced Friday by South
African President F.W. de Klerk in Cape Town, but said they did not
go far enough.
   In Lusaka, ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said the organization will
not abandon the military campaign, but conceded it will take a
lower profile.
   ``We have always said that the notion of the ANC unilaterally
abandoning armed struggle is out of the question,'' Jordan told
reporters.
   ``Any ceasing of hostilities will have to be negotiated and will
arise out of a mutually binding ceasefire,'' he said.
   De Klerk partly rescinded the state of emergency imposed in 1986
to quell disturbances. He announced the legalization of the ANC and
about 60 other opposition groups, and lifted the ban on hundreds of
anti-apartheid activists, including Tambo.
   De Klerk also promised to unconditionally free ANC leader Nelson
Mandela, but gave no date. The 71-year-old Mandela, imprisoned
since 1962, is serving a life sentence for helping plan the start
of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign against the white-led
government.
   ANC Secretary-General Alfred Nzo and Joe Slovo, head of the
South African Communist Party, flew to Stockholm late Friday to
join Walter Sisulu and other ANC veterans touring Scandinavia on
their first visit outside Africa since being freed in October.
   The meeting was an ANC executive committee session to ``discuss
new strategies because of the new situation which has arisen,''
said David Kgabang, an official of the ANC's Stockholm office.
   Kgabang gave no indication of how the strategy might change.
   Jordan described the guerrilla campaign as part of the ANC's
multipronged strategy to end apartheid.
   ``At particular times that aspect (armed struggle) has received
a higher profile than others. I think one can expect, in the
context of the legalization of the ANC, that probably other apsects
of our multipronged strategy will receive a much higher profile
than in the past,'' he said.
   Kgabang said he expected the ANC to reopen its offices in
Johannesburg and elsewhere in South Africa. The group operated
openly for 48 years until it was outlawed in 1960, and began its
sabotage campaign in 1961.
   The arrival of Nzo and Slovo brought together in Sweden most of
the ANC's top decision makers. Nzo is the group's acting president
in place of Tambo, who is recuperating from a stroke in a Stockholm
clinic. Slovo is a former head of the ANC's armed wing.
   They joined Thabo Mbeki, who is in charge of the ANC's foreign
relations, Sisulu and five other recently freed leaders from the
Mandela era.
   ``This is an opportunity to discuss developments with the
leadership which has been in the cold for so many years,'' Kgabang
said.
   Meetings were expected to last until Monday, when Sisulu and the
other released veterans planned to return to South Africa while the
rest head back to the ANC's headquarters in Lusaka.
   In its statement Friday, the ANC tempered its welcome of de
Klerk's speech with concern that some emergency restrictions
remained in place, including the power to detain without trial. It
called for the continued international isolation of South Africa
until apartheid is dismantled.

   A doctor who took bribes to falsify AIDS
tests for two aliens wanting to stay in the United States has been
sentenced to six months' house arrest and ordered to provide free
medical care to AIDS patients.
   Dr. Monir Dawoud, 50, of Jersey City also was placed on five
years' probation, ordered to donate $1,000 to an AIDS foundation
and fined more than $5,000 at his sentencing Friday.
   The government said Dawoud took $3,000 and falsified documents
so the government would not know that the two patients were
carrying the AIDS virus.
   Most aliens who test positive for the virus are deported.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McKenna refused to say whether the
two people whose records were falsified have been deported.
   Dawoud was one of seven doctors in Hudson County authorized to
examine aliens referred by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is telling voters that
in two weeks Japan will face a crucial choice between democracy and
socialism.
   But as official campaigning for parliamentary elections began
Saturday, voters didn't seem to share his concern.
   ``I need your support,'' he told an unenthusiastic crowd of
several hundred people who gathered in front of a busy Tokyo train
station.
   Most of his audience appeared to be party supporters invited to
the rally. Passers-by lingered only until traffic lights
changed.Nearby, more than 1,000 people gathered to hear the leader
of the main opposition Socialist Party.
   The embattled prime minister, one of 953 candidates vying for
the 512 seats in Parliament's powerful lower house, has said he
will resign if his Liberal Democratic Party cannot retain a
majority.
   And for the first time in 34 years of unbroken rule, the Liberal
Democrats are facing the possibility that even that goal may prove
to be too much.
   Kaifu said the Feb. 18 election will be ``critical,'' and warned
that voters will be deciding whether they want ``freedom and
democracy or socialism and communism.''
   ``The world has already rendered its verdict on socialism,'' he
said, referring to the ouster of hard-line Communist rulers in
Eastern Europe.
   At the Socialist rally, party leader Takako Doi said her party
planned to defeat the Liberal Democrats.
   ``Before the last election I said the mountain would move,''
said the 61-year-old Ms. Doi, alluding to the Liberal Democrats'
loss of their majority in the upper house of Parliament in July.
``We will move the second mountain.'' Ms. Doi said the governing
party lost in July because of its support for a 3 percent sales tax
and because of its leaders' involvement in financial and sex
scandals.
   ``It's been seven months, and they haven't changed a bit,'' she
said. ``The only road left is for each of you to change politics
with your votes.''
   Ms. Doi, the only woman leader of a major party, is widely
credited with increasing the Socialists' popularity.
   Setsuko Isobe, 60, said she also was drawn to the rally by Ms.
Doi. ``Women in Japan have been looked down on in the past, but Ms.
Doi shows that some of us can be very powerful.''
   Two of four candidates with Ms. Doi at the rally were women. No
women are running for the Liberal Democrats.
   Going into the election, the Socialists held 83 seats in the
lower house against 295 for the Liberal Democrats.
   The Clean Government Party held 54 seats, the Communists 26, the
Democratic Socialists 25. Twenty-nine seats were either vacant or
held by independents and minor party members.
   The Socialists are only backing 148 candidates, and would need
to form a coalition with other opposition parties to wrest the
majority away from the Liberal Democrats, who are backing 325
candidates.
   Kaifu assumed office in August after Sousuke Uno resigned to
take responsibility for the election defeat in July and amid
reports that he had an extramarital affair with a geisha.
   Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, stepped down in June
because of his ties to an influence-peddling scandal. Several other
Liberal Democratic leaders resigned in the scandal, in which the
information conglomerate Recruit Co. was accused of paying millions
of dollars in exchange for political influence.

   A Christian militia drove back rival
forces loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun on Saturday and seized control of
a vital Beirut port after some of his troops abandoned five days of
fighting and began defecting.
   Gunboats, tanks and cannons fell silent in response to a
Vatican-brokered cease-fire, but the shelling resumed after three
hours. More than 37 people were killed Saturday and hundreds of
thousands were trapped in shelters.
   Police said that overall, 164 people have been killed and 618
wounded in the clashes for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave
between Aoun's 20,000 soldiers and the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces
militia. The Lebanese Forces, led by Samir Geagea, is the main
Christian militia.
   The Lebanese Forces emerged from the fighting in control of 60
percent of the Christian enclave, with Aoun's troops entrenched
only in the eastern and northern edges of east Beirut as well as
the mountainous Metn province northeast of the capital.
   At the start of the fighting on Tuesday, each side controlled
half of the Christian enclave.
   Civilians said the fighting in dense residential areas had
caused some of the worst damage in 15 years of civil war.
   ``We never had a war like this,'' said Robin Haik, 24, who fled
to Cyprus aboard a ferry during a lull in the fighting. ``The
Lebanese Forces put all kinds of artillery between every house to
try to get the army, and the army tried to hit them with all kinds
of shells.''
   The five-day battle has kept half a million people, or half of
the enclave's population, hiding in poorly equipped basements and
bomb shelters with no electricity or water.
   The brief cease-fire was reached after police said 1,000 members
of Aoun's forces stationed at Beirut's port and along half of
Beirut's three-mile dividing Green Line defected. Six hundred
joined Geagea's militia and 400 went to the Lebanese army.
   That stripped Aoun of the Beirut port and his only docks. The
loss could disrupt his supplies, but both sides are believed to
have several months' worth of ammunition stockpiled.
   Aoun's failure to achieve a swift, clear-cut victory over
Geagea's outnumbered and outgunned men has damaged his image of
invincibility.
   Although Aoun's troops outnumber their rivals 3-to-1 and were
deeply committed to the war he fought last year against the Syrians
and their Moslem allies, they apparently do not have the same high
morale fighting fellow Christians, many of them relatives.
   Geagea's troops have said they are fighting for the survival of
their group. Geagea also kept some low-ranking army officers on his
payroll.
   The cease-fire _ the sixth in the latest round of fighting _ had
been called by the Vatican through Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente and
Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Aoun and Geagea, both Maronites, accepted the cease-fire and
said they had ordered their forces to honor it.
   The fighting resumed when artillery shells crashed into
residential districts of Moslem west Beirut, which is outside the
combat zone, and the city's eastern Christian sector.
   The barrage caught unprotected civilians who had emerged from
shelters to inspect damage and flee to safer areas carrying
bagloads of belongings.
   Many sought refuge behind sand barricades. Others rushed toward
west Beirut on foot as Aoun's soldiers cocked their guns in
preparation for battle.
   At one point, shells fell on residential districts at the rate
of six per minute, said a police spokesman who cannot be named in
line with regulations.
   The shelling set ablaze apartment buildings, warehouses, gas
stations and supermarkets. Police said Aoun's gunners and Lebanese
Forces militiamen were involved in the shelling, but it could not
be determined who provoked the exchange.
   When Aoun launched his offensive against the Lebanese Forces on
Tuesday, he pledged that no militias would be allowed to operate in
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and northeast of Beirut.
   Geagea failed to back Aoun in his confrontation with President
Elias Hrawi, elected under a peace plan adopted late last year by
the Lebanese parliament. Aoun refused to cede the presidential
palace to Hrawi, calling him a Syrian stooge.
   Syrian has the largest military presence in Lebanon and backs
the Christian-Moslem government led by Hrawi. Aoun's forces wages
furious battles with Syrian and Moslem forces last year in an
effort to drive out the Syrians.

   The government on Saturday lifted curfew
restrictions for 12 hours, but shops remained closed and few people
ventured out because of a strike called by Moslem separatists,
witnesses said.
   A bomb went off in the city during the relaxation, but a senior
police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
were no casualties.
   No other violence was reported.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front spread a strike call by word
of mouth on Friday night and early Saturday, local journalists
said, quoting shopkeepers in downtown Srinagar and its suburbs.
   The front is spearheading a four-decade-old campaign for
secession of Jammu-Kashmir state's predominantly Moslem Kashmir
valley from Hindu-majority India. Srinagar, the state's summer
capital, is the largest city in the valley.
   At least 76 people have been killed since the government
launched a crackdown on the secessionist movement on Jan. 20 and
imposed around-the-clock curfews. Most of those killed were
curfew-violating Moslems shot by the security forces.
   The government reported no deaths between Jan. 25 and Friday,
when at least four people were killed. Three of them died when
paramilitary police opened fire on a mob defying curfew in the
nearby city of Sopore, police officials said. The fourth was a
Hindu shopkeeper who was shot by militants in Srinagar.
   Saturday's strike in Srinagar was to protest the Sopore deaths,
Kaiser Mirza, a local journalist, quoted shopkeepers as saying. The
curfew relaxation began at 5 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m.
   Mirza said most shops did not open in the morning when curfew
was lifted, and a few shops that did open soon put down their
shutters when owners learned of the strike call.
   It was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing
attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause.
   During earlier curfew relaxations, which began one week ago,
vegetable shops and groceries were crowded and streets were filled
with people and traffic. On Saturday morning, small groups of men
stood at street corners but there was little traffic, Mirza said.
   The Moslem militancy dates to 1947 when India and Pakistan were
partitioned on religious lines after gaining independence from
Britain. The king of mostly Moslem Jammu-Kashmir chose union with
India instead of Islamic Pakistan.
   Moslem militants initially began agitating for union with
Pakistan but in recent months have been demanding independence
instead.
   India has accused Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir,
a charge Pakistan denies.
   The two countries have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir.
   The wars have left a slice of Kashmir under Pakistan's control
and a U.N.-supervised cease-fire line divides the valley into
Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   The Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, which comprises the valley
and the plains of Jammu to the south, is the country's only
Moslem-majority state. At least 64 percent of its 5 million people
follow Islam.
   Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of the 880 million
population.

   Here is a summary of developments Saturday in Eastern Europe:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOVIET UNION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will ask the Communist Party
leadership to give up its guaranteed hold on power and accept the
possibility of competing political parties, a Soviet news agency
said. The report also said Gorbachev will propose at the Central
Committee meeting this week a complete change in the party
structure and tacitly endorse the concept of private ownership.
   In Latvia, Armenian and Azerbaijani negotiators emerging from
their first talks expressed hope for a peaceful settlement of their
ethnic dispute but remained far apart on thorny territorial claims.
They agreed to seek the release of all hostages by March 1 and to
establish permanent relations between their republics' main
grass-roots political groups.

<HEAD>GERMANY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany rejected a Soviet
proposal that Americans, Canadians and Europeans vote on whether a
united Germany should be allowed. Kohl spoke with reporters after a
private meeting with Communist Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany
in Switzerland that focused on the economic crisis caused by the
exodus of East Germans to the West.

<HEAD>BULGARIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Parliament elected an economist to replace a hard-line Communist
as premier, and the new leader promised immediate reforms to combat
Bulgaria's ``social and economic crisis.'' A leader of the emerging
democratic opposition described the new premier, Andrei Lukanov, as
``a good choice'' and left open the possibility that some
opposition members might join a coalition government.

   Five ethnic Albanian groups asked the government to investigate
reports that police fired without warning on protesters in Kosovo
province, where unrest has killed 25 people and injured 120. About
300 ethnic Albanians rallied in the town of Podujevo, and a smaller
group was dispersed by riot police in the provincial capital of
Pristina. The province's Albanian majority is demanding more
autonomy from the Serbian republic, which said it tightened control
over the province last year to protect Kosovo's Serbian minority.

   Tens of thousands of people exercised their new freedoms by
forming a 100-mile human chain to protest a hydroelectric dam
project on the Danube River. About 100,000 people from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria formed the chain across
territory in all three nations. Meanwhile, thousands of West
Germans and Czechoslovaks formed a 2.5-mile human chain across
their border in a gesture of triumph over the waning divisions
between East and West.

<TEXT>
   U.S. National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft said Saturday that American forces in the future will be
smaller but ``more global'' in their orientation.
   Scowcroft said the Bush administration is adapting to the
massive transformations sweeping Eastern Europe but added that the
United States will remain a military power in Europe.
   ``It is the intention of the United States to remain engaged in
Europe with a substantial military and political presence,'' he
said. ``We feel we are a European power with an abiding and
permanent interest in Europe security.''
   In a speech Saturday in Switzerland, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
future military plans would include ``a substantial security role
for the United States on our continent.''
   Scowcroft spoke at the annual Wehrkunde conference in Munich,
which brings together security experts, lawmakers and government
officials from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and
Japan.
   ``America will remain engaged as a global power,'' Scowcroft
said. ``Part of the adjustment in our defense posture will be
toward active forces that are smaller, more global in orientation.''
   President Bush already has proposed reducing superpower forces
in Central Europe to 195,000 troops for each side. That would mean
a reduction of about 60,000 U.S. servicemen, most of them from West
Germany.
   Scowcroft, during his address, did not spell out how U.S. forces
would be poised to be more global in orientation.
   The conference was held against the backdrop of vastly improved
East-West relations and European integration that many predict will
lead to German unification.
   Scowcroft repeated U.S. support for German unity and said,
``Germany's growing strength may be a most prominent feature of
this new European balance.''
   Another speaker, Egon Bahr of the leftist opposition Social
Democratic Party, criticized Bush administration plans to develop
more short-range nuclear rockets.
   ``The United States can build more short-range nuclear rockets,
but we won't install them,'' Bahr told the American delegation.
   Short-range rockets stationed in West Germany are only capable
of hitting East Germany and Czechoslovakia, both of which are
undergoing democratic reform.

   Egypt expects Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to meet with Egyptian and Israeli officials in Europe
next week to discuss Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a government
source said Saturday.
   Baker leaves Monday night on a nine-day trip to Europe that
includes a meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
talks on the upheaval in Eastern Europe, possible German
reunification and Soviet political problems.
   Some have suggested that Baker also may meet privately with
Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
Egypt.
   The Egyptian Foreign Ministry source said such a meeting,
expected in Geneva, may depend on whether Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir wins a vote of confidence he has requested in his
right-wing Likud bloc.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, has been
closely involved with Egypt's daily diplomatic exchanges in recent
months with the United States, Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The exchanges are aimed at getting Baker, Abdel-Meguid and Arens
together to work out plans for a proposed Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue in Cairo as a first step toward achieving peace in the
Middle East.
   The ministers could discuss the composition of the Palestinian
delegation in Cairo and the agenda, both of which have proved to be
divisive issues.
   After ``intensive contacts in recent days'' between Egypt and
the United States, the Egyptian source said, Baker suggested a
ministerial meeting in Geneva, with Feb. 11 a possible date.
   ``Egypt is prepared to attend the trilateral meeting as
suggested (because it) believes the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is
a vital point along the road to peace in the Middle East,'' the
source said.
   Baker has stepped up efforts to open negotiations, talking by
telephone this week with Arens and with Abdel-Meguid. But a senior
U.S. official said, ``We are not at the point of saying such a
meeting will be held'' next week.
   Both the official and diplomatic sources, speaking in Washington
on condition of anonymity, said the gap between the Israeli and
Egyptian positions still was too wide to be bridged at a three-way
meeting involving Baker.
   Reports from Israel said that Arens told Washington a
ministerial session would have to be held after the Likud Central
Committee meeting.
   Shamir is pressing for a single endorsement from the 3,200
committee members for his leadership and for his plan to let
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip elect
delegates for talks with Israel on autonomy.
   His Likud bloc critics, led by Trade Minister Ariel Sharon who
chairs the Central Committee, want separate votes on the election
plan's details.
   Shamir has threatened to resign if he fails to win the
committee's support.
   Abdel-Meguid held three meetings with Baker in Washington last
month. The Foreign Ministry source said the Egyptian minister gave
Baker a working paper on the peace process then that had been
closely coordinated with the PLO.
   The source refused to give details but said the paper outlined a
position that ``was clear-cut and emphatic on safeguarding the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.''
   Egypt publicly supports PLO demands that the organization choose
Palestinian delegates to the Cairo talks and that the agenda be
open. The PLO also wants the delegation to include people deported
from the occupied territories and from Israel-annexed East
Jerusalem.
   Shamir insists on excluding the PLO from the process and
confining the talks' agenda to his election plan. He also opposes
participation of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, apparently
fearing this would undermine the city's status as Israel's declared
capital.

<HEAD>Bush Prepares Speech on Global Warming, Aides Deny Sununu
Interference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday discussed global
climate change with a newly formed presidential advisory panel
while White House aides denied reports that his chief of staff
toned down a speech he will make Monday on global warming.
   Bush never intended to reveal any policy shifts in his speech to
the opening session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, and the speech was tailored to reflect the official
administration position that considerable scientific uncertainty
remains about the seriousness of global warming, one administration
official said.
   Bush has been criticized for not taking a stronger world
leadership role on global warming, and his speech to the IPCC, a
United Nations-sponsored committee, will be closely watched by
environmental and business groups.
   In it he will showcase his administration's proposals and steps
already taken for research and protection involving global
environment, said the administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Officials on Saturday denied reports in The Washington Post and
New York Times that White House chief of staff John Sununu tried to
tone down the speech because it went too far in portraying global
warming as a serious problem.
   Sununu and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
Reilly have been at odds over the administration's policy on global
warming _ the gradual increase in the Earth's temperature due to
buildup of heat-trapping gases emitted into the Earth's atmosphere
by oil and coal combustion.
   Sununu's deputy, Andrew Card, on Saturday termed the newspaper
reports ``fictitious.'' He said Sununu had ``not written any part
of the speech,'' but reviewed it as he routinely would any speech.
   Card said finishing touches were being put on the speech
Saturday.
   The official who spoke anonymously said Sununu's ``only point
was to be careful about the tone,'' and make sure it reflected
administration policy on the inconclusiveness of scientific
research on global warming.
   Sununu, according to the reports, is not convinced of the
reliability of computer models that project temperature increases
of at least 4 degrees by the year 2050 and he fears the economic
consequences of shifting abruptly from today's energy sources.
   ``We take the issue seriously, but we're not prepared to make
decisions on potential changes that are not scientifically
proven,'' White House spokesman Steve Hart said Saturday. ``Science
does not support the theories'' that would prompt the strong
countermeasures environmentalists want to see.
   Other officials said that despite a reluctance to endorse
expensive and sweeping steps to mitigate global warming, Bush, in
his speech, will point out the environmental steps he is taking,
such as:
   _His proposal to spend $1 billion in fiscal year 1991, an
increase of 57 percent, for global change research.
   _Sweeping Clean Air Act changes currently being negotiated with
Congress.
   _A proposal to spend $175 million to begin a project of planting
1 billion trees.
   _Last year's regulatory restrictions on electric appliances.
   _The U.S. hosting of an international convention to work on a
framework agreement on climate change next fall.
   ``We are using this in a comprehensive way to give credit for
all the United States is doing to show leadership'' on the
environment, the official said.
   Sununu was with Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David,
Md., where a spokesman said global warming was among the topics
discussed at the first meting of the President's Council of
Advisers on Science and Technology Policy, chaired by White House
science adviser D. Allan Bromley. Bromley also heads the global
change committee within Bush's Domestic Policy Council of advisers.
   Bush prepared his Monday address as a congressional report
accused his administration of a ``leadership void'' without goals
or comprehensive strategy on global climate change.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
arm of Congress, praised the government for trying to develop an
international consensus on global warming through the U.N. panel.
But it says the administration also should develop a national
policy.
   ``The president has not designated any individual or agency to
assume overall leadership or management responsibility for global
climate change,'' said the report released Friday. ``Without such a
designated leadership position or focal point, no identifiable
hierarchical structure for policy and decision-making on global
climate change issues has emerged.''
   The study was requested by House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich. In a letter to the White House,
the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy
and State, Dingell called the findings ``troubling.''
   He urged ``coordinated leadership, and a wise and reasonable
approach to addressing and hopefully solving these complex and
controversial issues in a timely manner.''
   The report notes that Bush announced last March the United
States would join other industrial countries in phasing out
production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbon by the year 2000.
   Bush made no similar commitment to control carbon dioxide
emissions, another gas believed to be depleting the planet's
protective ozone layer, the report said. But he has directed Energy
Secretary James Watkins to develop a national energy strategy that
will include proposals for reducing the global warming
``greenhouse'' gas emissions caused by energy sources.

   The spirit may be willing, but the
salary is weak, and church officials say that finding an organist
is getting harder.
   ``Half the parishes either aren't able to pay or don't want to
pay the musicians what they deserve, so the musicians are going
elsewhere,'' said John Hubert, organist at St. Michael's Episcopal
Church in Bristol.
   The Holy Trinity Church in Central Falls was almost left in the
lurch at Christmas after its regular organist left for a
better-paying job.
   ``I figured we'd come up with somebody, that it would just be a
matter of getting in touch with one or two people,'' said the Rev.
Robert M. Beirne. It took more than 15 phone calls, and in the end,
the four Masses were handled by four musicians, he said.
   Jean Richard Dupont, placement officer for the Rhode Island
chapter of the American Guild of Organists, said Saturday that Holy
Trinity is not alone _ there is a nationwide shortage of organists.
   ``You can look at any of our magazines ... they always have
ads'' for organists, he said.
   Fewer people are studying organ, especially sacred music. But
the main reason is that women, who dominate the field, don't have
the time anymore.
   In the past ``they could get away with it because there were a
lot of women who really didn't need another income and who were
willing to do it out of love,'' said Dupont.
   ``Those women are out working in other jobs now, and they don't
want to come back to the church and work for a pittance.''
   The Rhode Island chapter of the organists guild issued a book
last month outlining what it considers fair recompense for church
musicians.
   The book suggests salaries of $26,400 to $31,000 for full-time
church organists holding a doctorate in music, and from $4,700 to
$5,800 per year for musicians who work 10 to 14 hours a week and
hold a guild certificate.
   Dupont said guilds in other cities have issued similar books,
with wages set for each region.
   The Rhode Island guild has about 125 members and there are at
least 175 other organists in the state, Dupont said.
   A 1987 survey found that of the 135 respondents, the annual pay
ranged from zero to $20,000, with a median of $5,200. Taking into
account time for services and rehearsals, the average hourly pay
was $9.82, with the highest $33.97.
   Dupont, 55, who said he puts in about 10 hours of preparation
for the Sunday service he plays at the First Universalist Church in
Providence, said the job is more than just tickling the ivories.
   ``You have to have training ... experience, the ability to know
what is good music and not good music, you have to be able to
direct a choir and in a choir you have so many personalities ...
you have to be a diplomat,'' said Dupont.
   The guild recommended organists should receive $50 to $75 for
funerals and $75 to $100 for weddings. The 1986 guidelines by the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence recommend $30 to $50 for
weddings.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla
group on Saturday offered to call a truce until May so that the
government can run congressional and presidential elections in
peace.
   But the defense minister said he was skeptical about the
proposal by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and noted
another leftist guerrilla group has said it would disrupt balloting
in the northeast.
   Near the cocaine trafficking center of Medellin, police found
six bodies Saturday with multiple gunshot wounds and their hands
and their feet tied. Police said the latest victims brought the
toll to 50 in a 6-week-old gang war. The cease-fire offer,
published in the Bogota newspaper La Prensa, was made in a letter
to four former presidents, a Catholic Church cardinal and a leading
businessman.
   ``The eminent recipients of this proposal will be the overseers
of what could be a new process of reconciliation and peace for the
Colombian family,'' the letter said.
   Defense Minister Oscar Botero told a news conference that
leftist guerrillas, which have an estimated 5,000 fighters, had
announced truces before but had failed to observe them.
   ``We have to see if the guerrillas fulfill their promise,'' he
said.
   Conservative Party leader Misael Pastrana, who served as
president from 1970 to 1974, said he would be willing to form a
committee to oversee such a truce, La Prensa reported.
   The paper quoted Pastrana as saying that the government of
President Virgilio Barco should take steps to ensure that the
proposal leads to a permanent peace in the 30-year-old insurgency.
   Botero said army troops would be sent to northeastern Colombia
to protect polling centers from the pro-Cuba National Liberation
Army, which has promised to disrupt balloting.
   The congressional elections are scheduled for March 11, and
presidential elections are to be held May 27.
   The wave of drug killings began after police shot and killed a
leader of the Medellin cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, in a Dec.
15 gunfight on Colombia's northern coast.
   Police said some of the recent drug killings are likely the work
of underlings vying for control of the criminal empire Rodriguez
Gacha left behind.
   Another gang representing illegal gamblers and calling itself
``The Cleaning of Colombian Soccer'' said in several communiques
sent to the local press that it is eliminating drug traffickers and
other criminals.
   Most of the victims in the recent slayings had criminal records.
On Friday, police found nine bodies near Bogota, all with their
hands and feet tied and with several gunshots.

   A troupe of women in camouflage, toting
fake guns and led by a Groundhog Queen in a wheelchair, marched
through the business district, passing along wishes of goodwill on
Groundhog Day.
   ``May the shadow of the groundhog never darken your door,''
Groundhog Queen Kay Lowe and her group told Mayor Jerry Campbell
and merchants Friday. ``Grr ... Grr ... Groundhog!''
   Lowe started the tradition 12 years ago. This year bad luck fell
on her door and she broke her foot a week before Groundhog Day. But
the injury didn't stop her from singing odes to the woolly beast
with six other ``Hogettes.''
   Accompanied by Gus the Stuffed Groundhog, they blew into
bullhorns, sounding like dying moose. ``It scares away the
groundhogs because we don't want to hurt them,'' Sandi Turner said.
   She said the women carried the guns to protect the animals. ``A
lot of people would hurt groundhogs,'' Turner said. ``We never
would.''
   Mayor Campbell offered each a lollipop at the start of their
trek.
   ``I think it's a good way to come out of the winter months into
the spring,'' Campbell said. ``They're promoting goodwill.''

   Israeli troops arrested almost 100 Palestinians
in a roundup of suspected agitators in the occupied West Bank, and
soldiers shot and wounded 10 Arabs in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab
reports said.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir demanded an end to a
barrage of criticisms by rivals in his right-wing Likud bloc, and
said that his party ``cannot live'' with the public dispute.
   A source in the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said Egypt expects
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to invite the Israeli and
Egyptian foreign minsters to a meeting in Geneva next week to
prepare for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks if Shamir wins a
Wednesday vote of confidence by party leaders.
   Rebel Likud hawks, led by Industry and Trade Minister Ariel
Sharon, have been trying to undermine the foreign ministers'
meeting and Shamir's efforts to implement a peace plan that calls
for Palestinian elections in the occupied lands.
   The Likud rebels have demanded that in place of one vote of
confidence at the party meeting, the 3,200 delegates vote
separately on each of the plan's details.
   Likud's coalition partner, the left-leaning Labor Party decided
Saturday to leave the government if Shamir loses the vote, Israel
television reported.
   Shamir accused the rebels of undermining Israel's security by
making the dispute public.
   ``To put on a display before hostile and enemy elements...is
destructive,'' he said. ``This phenomenon must be dismissed from
the life of the Likud.''
   In the occupied West Bank on Saturday, troops imposed curfews on
the towns of Ramallah, el-Bireh and the Kalandia refugee camp and
detained almost 100 Palestinians as part of a security sweep, an
army spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the Palestinians were suspected of organizing
disturbances and taking part in violent anti-Israeli activities.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Palestinians closed their stores and
transportation ground to a halt to observe a general strike ordered
by the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad organization.
   Arab reports said soldiers wounded 10 Palestinians during
demonstrations in the Gaza Strip.
   The strike was called to mark the 40th day following the death
of Khalid Sheik Ali, who died after a beating by security agents in
a Gaza prison cell.
   The secret Shin Bet security agency suspended two interrogators
in December after an independent autopsy revealed that Ali, 27,
died of internal injuries sustained during a beating.
   At least 651 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians during the almost 26 month uprising.
   Forty-three Israelis have died and Palestinians have killed 176
of their fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.

   The revolutionary government bowed to
opposition pressure on Saturday and revamped the ruling council to
give a minority role to 29 opposition parties.
   The National Salvation Front's council transformed itself into
the nucleus of a new Council of National Unity, a 180-member panel
that will rule until May 20 elections. The front will hold 93 of
the seats.
   The front, unelected and serving by decree since the December
revolution that ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, has
been under pressure to become more democratic.
   The front includes several former leading Communists and has
been accused of plotting to restore a dictatorship. In addition,
the opposition had complained that no fair elections would be
possible if the front both organized and participated in the May
elections.
   The new Council of National Unity will have 90 seats for
political parties and 90 for prominent front members, including
those who fought in the revolution, workers, farmers, youth and
ethnic minorities.
   The 90 political seats will be split among the front and the 29
opposition parties, with each group getting three seats.
   ``Starting today, the National Salvation Front ... takes a new
form,'' interim Vice President Cazimir Ionescu told repoters. He
referred to the action as a ``reshuffle,'' rather than a
dissolution.
   ``Dissolution would have meant a void in state power,'' he said,
adding that a continuation of power was necessary ``to ensure
stability'' and avoid a worsening of the already chaotic economic
situation.
   Last week, the front announced it was transforming itself into a
political movement with no links to its governing council in order
to run in the elections, the first free vote since 1946. The front
has refused to become a political party, calling itself a mass
political organization instead.
   The 1946 elections were won by the National Peasant Party, now
the largest opposition group, but were overturned by the Communists.
   Experts from the front and the political parties also met to
discuss a draft electoral law promulgated by the front earlier this
week. It provides for a two-chamber parliamentary system.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu said in a state radio interview
that ``the temporary Council of National Unity will function as a
pre-parliament'' without detailing what its structures or powers
would be.
   ``The National Salvation Front, as a political organization with
a structure and platform that is consistent ... will take part in
the elections at the same level as all the other political
organizations,'' Iliescu said in another interview, in Saturday's
edition of the daily Adevarul.
   Iliescu is likely to retain his post of president until the May
elections, Ionescu said.
   The front's political platform will be announced soon, he said.
   The ruling front's agreement to a Council of National Unity came
at a meeting Thursday with the 29 opposition parties.
   Three historic opposition parties had originally demanded that
the self-appointed ruling council of the front step down
altogether, claiming it had no legitimacy.
   But in recent days, the opposition parties have resigned
themselves to power-sharing with the front holding the dominant
position. Their leaders said that at least until the elections,
this arrangement was the only viable alternative to being totally
locked out of power.
   ``What was announced today was in step with the decisions ... to
build a provisional council of national unity,'' said Iftene Pop,
vice president of the National Peasant Party. ``The new council
better mirrors the real balance of political forces existing in
Romania and ends the front's monopoly on power.''
   ``More precisely, it bars the way to dictatorship and a new
one-party system,'' he added.

<HEAD>State Department Report Highly Critical of China Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration report to Congress
complains in unmistakable terms about human rights abuses in China
following last year's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement
there, according to sources who have seen the document.
   The State Department's annual assessment of repressive practices
around the globe ``doesn't pull any punches'' when it comes to
China, one source said. Another said it ``describes every human
rights crime you can think of'' regarding the Beijing government.
   The unambiguity of the section on China surprised some
congressional figures, particularly those who have charged the
president himself with soft-peddling the issue and catering too
much to the communist government.
   The report is not scheduled for public release until Feb. 21,
when Robert Schifter, assistant secretary for human rights, is
scheduled to testify on it before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   ``Murders, disappearances, executions, suppression of labor
rights, religious persecution of Catholics and Buddhists, slave
labor camps in western China _ you name it, it's in there,'' said
one source who discussed contents of the report on condition he not
be identified.
   Another source, who also declined identification, said ``We
expected ... they might go somewhat easy on the Chinese,'' in light
of the recent missions to Beijing by national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft. ``But they didn't,'' he said. ``The report doesn't
pull any punches.''
   A State Department spokeswoman, Sondra McCarty, declined comment
Saturday on the new human rights report, saying it would be
premature to do so before Schifter's testimony to the House panel.
   Some members of Congress have complained that Bush and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III were far too muted in their criticism
of the Chinese regime after last summer's bloody suppression of
student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   And most Democrats, and even many Republicans, were particularly
upset when Bush last month vetoed a bill protecting an estimated
40,000 Chinese students in the United States from deportation.
   The president argued he had accomplished the same objectives
through administrative action. The students, meanwhile, expressed
fear that he might revoke his executive order in some future
bargain with Beijing.
   Referring to the president's veto, sustained in the Senate a
week ago, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., declared ``It was
wrong for the Bush administration to yield to pressure from a
communist dictatorship in Beijing . ... One lesson of the past 45
years is that no Congress and no president should be timid in the
defense of freedom.''
   Bush, at a news conference following the Senate vote, repeated
his pledge that ``No chinese student who is in this country is
going to be sent back against his or her will.'' He added that ``we
will continue to urge the People's Republic of China to recognize
the human rights of its citizens.''
   At the same time, Bush pronounced himself ``very pleased'' that
Beijing had lifted martial law, had stopped harassing the U.S.
Embassy and had released 573 people from prison.
   ``I've very pleased they've lightened up on the areas where I
think we can really move things forward,'' including Peace Corps
and Fulbright scholarship exchanges, he said.
   NBC News, which reported first on the still-unreleased human
rights report, quoted this passage from it: ``As of year's end,
there were continuing reliable reports of beatings of political
detainees in the Beijing area by security forces ... prisoners,
both criminal and political, are subjected to severe psychological
pressure to confess.''
   Earlier this week, Baker went before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee with a prepared text which named Cuba and China
as countries who ``try to shut out democratic values,'' but he
omitted the reference to China in his spoken testimony.

<HEAD>Taped Confession Helps Deaf-Mute Killer Get Life</HEAD>

   A deaf-mute spared himself from a possible
death sentence with a sign-language confession to murdering a
14-year-old boy after what he said was a video arcade fight over a
dollar.
   ``I pushed him into the car, and I started choking him,'' Brian
Hodge said in the confession. ``I kept choking and choking him. He
went back and grabbed me in the crotch, and it really hurt, so I
choked him harder.
   ``He was pushing me in the face and saying, `Stop, stop.' It was
too late. He should have paid me back before,'' he said through a
sign-language interpreter.
   The videotaped confession was made as part of a bargain with
prosecutors in which Hodge pleaded guilty Friday to murder and
attempted rape in the July slaying of Karl Phillip Heiland.
   In exchange, he was spared the possibility of the death penalty
and will receive life in prison plus 15 years.
   The defense had intended to argue that the 25-year-old
electrical worker committed second-degree murder because he never
meant to kill the boy.
   But prosecutors said they would have tried to prove that Hodge
killed Karl while trying to rape him, not by accident in a fight
over the dollar.
   Michael Benito, an assistant state attorney, said he would have
put on evidence that Hodge followed a different boy the day before
he killed Karl.
   On the videotape, Hodge distanced himself from the sexual
attacks.
   ``I didn't do it, the devil did it,'' he said. ``That's when the
devil was calling me to have sex.''
   Six weeks after the slaying, Karl's mother, Cathy Lee Heiland,
committed suicide near his grave by running a hose from her exhaust
pipe to the inside of her car. Police found her next to photographs
of Karl.

   Jesse Jackson Saturday appealed to President F.W.
de Klerk to follow the example of Abraham Lincoln and John F.
Kennedy and press ahead with his reforms, regardless of any
threatened backlash from white conservatives.
   The U.S. black civil rights leader expressed ``hope and
caution'' about South Africa as he prepared to revisit the nation
after being refused entry for a decade.
   Jackson said he hoped that in giving him a visa for the first
time since 1979, South Africa was sending ``yet another signal of a
commitment to openness.''
   Jackson visited with black cultural groups in London Saturday,
and he was to attend two public meetings Sunday. On Monday he is to
meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   He flies to Zambia later on Monday and to South Africa on
Wednesday, and he said he hoped to meet de Klerk as well as jailed
black leader Nelson Mandela, in or out of prison.
   De Klerk on Friday legalized the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla group fighting white rule, and lifted restrictions
on 60 opposition groups and 374 individuals.
   He also promised Mandela's imminent release.
   Jackson mentioned President Lincoln's emancipation of the slaves
and President Kennedy's desegregation drive in the southern United
States. ``And so Mr. de Klerk must be encouraged to move. ... Most
people in the world are pulling for him to go farther and don't
stop now.''
   Jackson said de Klerk must not be deterred by any threatened
backlash.
   ``Great leadership does not follow opinion polls. It molds
opinion,'' he told reporters. ``Mr. de Klerk is now in a position
to mold opinion and make things happen, and should not let this
moment pass. ... He must seize this moment to do the right thing.''
   He should free Mandela and abolish the remaining pillars of
apartheid like the Group Areas Act, which segregates residential
rights by race, Jackson said.
   Jackson, hitherto a fervent supporter of economic sanctions
against South Africa, was noncommittal about whether the West
should continue to apply them.
   ``Sanctions is not the central issue,'' he said, noting that de
Klerk had not made their removal a condition for reform and that
President Bush had said it was premature to talk of lifting
sanctions.
   ``Sanctions should be part of the negotiating process therefore,
not a precondition,'' Jackson said. ``And to put the focus on
sanctions rather than apartheid is to shift the focus away from the
need to encourage Mr. de Klerk to continue. And what we heard
yesterday was reason for hope and caution.''
   But he said South African blacks now saw economic sanctions the
same way the West sees NATO now that Eastern Europe is free of
Soviet domination: ``NATO is both a deterrent on one hand and a
stimulus to democracy on the other.''

<HEAD>Nesting Eagles Threaten Beltway Construction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A family of bald eagles has moved into the
path of the planned Orlando beltway, and developers are seeking an
exception to a ban on building near the threatened birds' nest.
   The mother eagle and her two eaglets have settled on a flat-top
pine just 50 feet west of where cars will zoom onto the beltway
where it crosses over Lake Jesup in Seminole County.
   Usually, state and federal agencies do not allow development
within 750 feet of a nest of the threatened species. But the
expressway authority is seeking a first-time-ever exception to
their policy, which wildlife officials fear could set an unwelcome
precedent.
   ``Once we do it, then everybody will want to do this,'' said Don
Wood, endangered species coordinator for the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission.
   Bald eagles are an endangered species in most states but are
classified only as threatened in Florida, which has one of the
largest groups of the birds in the nation. Florida prohibits any
disturbance, molestation, harm, or harassment to the eagles.
Violators can be fined up to $50,000 and sentenced to three years
in jail.
   Wood acknowledged that the uniqueness of the situation should
make it virtually impossible to duplicate.
   First, the nest appears to have been built in the past month,
long after the Seminole County Expressway Authority plotted where
its beltway section would run through the county.
   Second, the eagles appear to be plentiful around Lake Jesup. In
fact, the expressway route across the lake was selected
specifically to bypass two other eagle nests. And eagle expert
Doris Mager has plotted at least 11 active nests around the lake.
   ``We're going to consider there are a lot of eagles in the
area,'' Wood said. ``The loss of one nest would not be as
significant because of that.''
   Moving the toll road farther east would place it in the
environmentally sensitive Black Hammock. To the west, the route
would pose further engineering problems, said beltway environmental
consultant W. Michael Dennis.
   State and federal officials are asking the expressway authority
for certain safeguards before it could allow the road to be built
so close to the nest.
   The authority would be required to prove the nest was new, leave
a belt of trees between the nest and the road, halt construction
during the Oct. 1 through May 15 nesting season, ensure that lights
do not hit the nest and monitor the birds' reaction to the
construction.
   Gerald Brinton, executive director of the expressway authority,
said meeting those constraints would likely raise the cost of the
$158 million project.

<HEAD>Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu Makes Surprise Visit to Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jubilation over the pending release of South
Africa's imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela must be tempered
with the realization that apartheid is far from ended, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu said Saturday.
   Tutu, visiting to confer with other opposition leaders and U.S.
officials, said the fight for equality is not over and urged
continued political and economic pressure on the South African
government to dismantle apartheid.
   ``We have not yet the complete dismantling of apartheid and this
is the pinpoint of the sanction program. We want apartheid totally
dismantled,'' said Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   The Anglican archbishop said his initial joy over the lifting of
some political restrictions against blacks Friday was tempered
later by the realization that apartheid still is far from over.
   He said his change of heart came after ``having pinched myself
and convinced myself it wasn't a dream and it was real. ... Of
course you see apartheid is still in place.''
   Tutu said he is looking forward to relinquishing his position as
South Africa's pre-eminent opponent of apartheid now that Mandela
is to be released from prison.
   ``I said long ago I was just an interim leader until he
(Mandela) comes out,'' he said. ``He's been making us work too
hard.''
   Tutu was accompanied by Patrick Lekota, publicity secretary for
the United Democratic Front. They were met at Logan International
Airport by Themba Vilakazi, head of the Boston-based Fund for a
Free South Africa, just returned from Zambia where the African
National Congress is based.
   The group was met by Zenani Mandela Dlamini, 30, eldest daughter
of Nelson and Winnie Mandela and a political science student at
Boston University.
   Their arrival came less than 24 hours after South African
President F.W. de Klerk announced in a speech to Parliament that
Mandela would be released unconditionally, although he set no date.
   De Klerk also lifted bans on more than 30 opposition groups
after three decades of underground activity against white rule,
including the African National Congress, outlawed in 1960.
   The announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new
constitution that would end the black majority's exclusion from
national politics.
   Tutu, a member of Harvard University's Board of Overseers, was
here to attend a meeting at the school. Lekota said he planned to
attend a meeting of the Albert Einstein Institute, a Cambridge
think tank that advocates the use of non-violent sanctions to solve
political unrest.
   Mandela's daughter, greeted fondly by Tutu, told reporters she
was skeptical of the recent changes in South Africa, despite the
news her father would be released.
   ``This has been going on for 300 years,'' she said. ``What
happened Friday, I'm not overly excited about it. Release some
political prisoners, to me, that's nothing. We want total majority
voting in South Africa. Until that happens, I will not be
satisfied.''
   Her husband, Thumbumuzi Dlamini, 39, is a prince from Swaziland,
one of the sons of the late king Sobhuza II. His brother is now the
king of Swaziland, an independent country almost completely
surrounded by South Africa. They live in the Boston area with their
three children.
   Lekota, who was recently released from prison, was more positive
about the changes. He predicted members of the white minority in
South Africa who resist change will eventually be forced to accept
the idea of equality with blacks.
   ``They cannot stop us,' he said. ``We are unstoppable now.''
   Lekota said he also planned to meet with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and State Department officials to give the South African
black perspective on the recent turn of events.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Saturday elected an
economist to replace a hard-line Communist as premier, and the new
leader promised immediate reforms to combat Bulgaria's ``social and
economic crisis.''
   A leader of the emerging democratic opposition described the new
premier, Andrei Lukanov, as ``a good choice'' and left open the
possibility that some opposition members might join a coalition
government.
   The election, the latest development in a wave of changes, came
one day after the Communist Party expelled many of the old orthodox
Communists and picked another advocate of change as party chief.
   Lukanov's government is to hold power until free elections are
held in May.
   The National Assembly unanimously chose Lukanov as premier after
accepting the resignation of former Premier Georgi Atanassov and
his 22-member Cabinet.
   Lukanov, a 51-year-old economist with years of experience in
government and party politics, said he was accepting the post at a
time of ``moral and economic crisis.''
   He later told reporters that his new government would liberalize
the news media. He asked for ``constructive criticism by the
press'' and ``complete objectivity.''
   Apparently to underline the new leadership's more open media
policy, Filip Bokov announced his resignation as head of state
Radio and Television, a position he has held for less than three
months.
   The official news agency BTA said the reason for his resignation
was his appointment to the new Communist Party presidium,
apparently to avoid a conflict of interest.
   Lukanov and his reform-minded colleagues _ new party chief
Alexander Lilov and President Petar Mladenov _ face public
skepticism about their commitment to reform, as well as their
ability to handle a flagging economy hobbled by unprecedented labor
unrest.
   ``We have to make fundamental economic reforms, and we have to
do it immediately,'' he said. ``The social and economic crisis is
now the most important thing, and it is the most important task to
come out of the crisis.'' He said he would detail his recovery plan
in a speech to the National Assembly on Thursday, when lawmakers
will swear in the new government.
   It was not clear if Lukanov, Lilov or Mladenov would have the
most substantive power in the new government. Mladenov on Nov. 10
replaced hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov after 35 years in power,
and he promised free elections and oversaw the end to guaranteed
Communist supremacy in Bulgaria.
   Lukanov has been the main negotiator for the party at broad
talks with the opposition and is perceived by many Bulgarians as
the most trustworthy Communist leader.
   Lukanov said the government must be rejuvenated and said he
would move beyond career technocrats to choose a Cabinet with
``clever professionals and well-trained people.''
   He said he was hopeful that opposition groups would support an
interim coalition government.
   Petar Beron, a leader of the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces, said earlier Saturday that his group would not take part,
but later indicated that some coalition members might do so on
their own.
   He said Lukanov was ``a good choice.''
   He said the Communists have not said how much power they will
share, and he predicted little chance of a real opposition role as
long as the National Assembly is controlled by the Communists. The
opposition's participation would be ``like a Muppet show,'' Beron
said.
   Whatever its composition, the new government ``could not be
worse than it has been up to now,'' Beron said.
   Blagovest Sendov, president of the Academy of Sciences, said
only private initiative could pull Bulgaria out of its economic
crisis.
   Lukanov did not reject private ownership outright but said this
was one of various approaches to be considered in reforming the
economy.

<HEAD>Lab Loses Certification to Test Federal Workers For Drugs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 14th graf, `Ms. Pizzo ..., with 3 grafs to UPDATE with
comment from company president.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company hired by the city of New Orleans
to screen its employees for drugs has lost its certification to
test federal workers.
   Laboratory Specialists Inc. is the first such lab in the nation
to lose federal approval, according to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md.
   Since Jan. 24, the Belle Chasse company has been forbidden to
test federal workers or those on federal contracts.
   The company is still allowed to test city employees and pursue
other drug-testing contracts.
   Officials at the federal National Institute on Drug Abuse won't
say why they rescinded LSI's certification other than that the lab
failed to maintain standards to conduct urine drug testing for
federal agencies.
   City personnel director Michael Doyle said it's not clear what
effect the decertification would have on the city's new drug
testing program.
   New Orleans police, firefighters and other employees have been
subject to random drug testing since Jan. 1, but the results of
testing _ or any resulting disciplinary or rehabilitation measures
_ have not been announced.
   Twenty police officers per day have been selected randomly by
computer for the past week and given about an hour's notice, police
union members said.
   ``When you are dealing with someone's livelihood, I think you
should go with the ultimate accreditation, and that's the federal
government,'' said Michael Conn, treasurer of the Police
Association of New Orleans.
   He did not say whether the union would challenge the testing
program because of the decertification.
   LSI was chosen in December, partly because it was the only lab
in the state with federal approval, Doyle said. A spokeswoman at
NIDA said LSI was the first of 42 laboratories nationwide to lose
federal certification.
   ``We are working with them to have it reinstated,'' NIDA
spokeswoman Mona Brown said. The federal agency, which charges
$17,000 a year for certification, inspects the labs twice a year
and tests quality control every other month.
   LSI has been in the drug testing business for 11 years. The
company has 500 to 600 customers nationwide, lab director Pat Pizzo
said in November.
   ``I want to make it clear this is a suspension, not a
revocation,'' said LSI President Arthur R. Peterson.
   He said he did not know what caused the suspension of the lab's
federal certification, but that his company has been continuing
talks with the federal agency to obtain reinstatement.
   Peterson said he had heard from some LSI clients, but had not
discussed the matter with the city of New Orleans.

<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole on Saturday
lamented Lebanon's ``long night of death and destruction,'' saying
all foreign forces should leave the war-torn country.
   ``For too many in Washington, Lebanon has fallen off the screen.
The only `issues list' that it tops is the list of those issues to
avoid in the future,'' the Kansas senator said.
   Dole said that factional strife among Christians in East Beirut,
together with the continued presence of Syrian forces in the Middle
Eastern country, does not point toward a peaceful resolution.
   ``Lebanon's long night of death and destruction continues,'' he
said.
   In a speech prepared for a dinner sponsored by the American Task
Force on Lebanon, an organization of some 100 prominent Americans
of Lebanese descent, he called on Christians ``to end their bloody
test of might and will.''
   A copy of Dole's Los Angeles speech was released by his
Washington office.
   As violence escalated last year, the United States withdrew
Ambassador John McCarthy and other Americans on the U.S. Embassy
staff. Only Lebanese remain at the embassy.
   Dole urged appointment of a special American envoy _ ``someone
who will devote full time and attention to Lebanon, someone who
will make it clear that the United States is serious about
Lebanon.''
   President Bush has deplored the increasing incidences of
violence in Lebanon, and the administration went into federal court
to win the ouster of Lebanese Gen. Michael Aoun's ambassador in
Washington, Abdallah Bouhabib.
   The State Department argued that his continued occupation of the
building was ``causing increasingly serious adverse consequences
for the nation's foreign relations.''
   The State Department sought Bouhabib's ouster at the request of
Lebanon's new government led by President Elias Hrawi, who was
elected in November with the backing of the 22-nation Arab League.
   The United States recognized the Hrawi government last November
and had been conducting its business with a Hrawi-appointed
ambassador rather than with Bouhabib even before before the embassy
was turned over to Hrawi representatives Friday under a federal
court order.
   Aoun, who controls Lebanon's Christian sector with about 1
million residents, refuses to recognize the Hrawi government and
continues to hold out with 20,000 troops at the presidential palace
in Beirut. The State Department has called for Aoun to step down.
   Dole said the United States should put pressure on Syrian
President Hafez Assad to remove forces from Lebanon and said the
Arab League should press Assad for a troop withdrawal timetable.
   He also said that Secretary of State James A. Baker, in talks
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow this
week, should say that ``as long as Moscow gives Assad the green
light for aggression in Lebanon, the United States will keep out
the yellow caution light on the path of U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   ``I do believe it is my responsibility, as someone who cares
deeply about Lebanon, to plead with every faction and every
Lebanese leader (to) ... end the senseless killing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A wide band of stormy weather socked the nation's midsection
Saturday, bringing heavy rain to sections of the South and a
mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain to the north and east.
   Snow fell in the lower Great Lakes region and was spreading
toward the Northeast, prompting winter storm watches or advisories
for snow, rain and everything in between across most of the Middle
Atlantic States and southern New England through the weekend.
   In the south-central United States, showers and thunderstorms
extended from eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley to the
Ohio Valley. Strong thunderstorms developed along the central Gulf
Coast.
   Parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Louisiana got 2 to 3
inches of rain or more from Friday night to midday Saturday, and
flash flood watches were posted in much of the area.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 1.79 inches at Jackson, Ky.; 1.46 inches at Muscle
Shoals, Ala.; 1.36 inches at Jackson, Tenn., 1.07 inch at Memphis,
Tenn.; and 0.99 inch at Pine Bluff, Ark.
   On the Plains, a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and snow fell
in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas early in the
afternoon. Wichita, Kan., got 2 inches of snow Saturday morning.
Farther north, light snow extended from eastern Iowa to Upper
Michigan.
   High winds in Maine dropped wind chills to 30 below. In the
South, record high temperatures for the date were set.
   Birmingham, Ala., had a reading of 79 degrees by early
afternoon, one degree higher than the 1932 record; Jacksonville,
Fla., 86, two degrees higher than the 1989 record; and Merdian,
Miss., 83, three degrees higher than the 1957 record. Baton Rouge,
La., and Wilmington, N.C., both hit 82 degrees, tying records for
the date.
   In the Pacific Northwest, a cold front spread rain and snow into
Washington, Oregon and California, and winter storm warnings and
advisories were posted in mountain regions. Winds gusting to 56 mph
downed trees around Walla Walla, Wash.
   The low for the nation Saturday morning in the Lower 48 was 13
degrees below zero at Caribou, Maine, and Craig, Colo.
   Saturday's rain came a day after thunderstorms produced hail,
strong winds and a couple of reported tornadoes across the lower
Mississippi Valley. Tornadoes near Brewton Mill, La., and in
Grenada County, Miss., damaged some homes but caused no injuries.

   Opponents of U.S. military aid to El
Salvador staged a protest Saturday afternoon as President Alfredo
Cristiani, in Boston for a ``private visit,'' left his hotel.
   About 25 protestors from the Boston-based Central American
Solidarity Association shouted at Cristiani as he left the hotel
garage at 1:15 p.m. in a limousine followed by a small caravan of
security personnel.
   David Voisin, a spokesman for CASA, said the demonstrators were
also protesting the slaying of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador
last November.
   Voisin said Cristiani planned to meet with Cardinal Bernard Law
in an effort to ease tensions between his government and the Roman
Catholic Church, but spokesmen for the cardinal said no meeting was
planned,
   A State Department spokesman would only say that Cristiani was
in Boston for a ``private visit,'' The Boston Herald reported
Saturday.
   Cristiani was in Washington earlier this week lobbying Capitol
Hill to continue the $1.4 million-a-day El Salvador receives in
U.S. aid.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people
exercised their new freedom Saturday by forming a 100-mile human
chain to protest a hydroelectric dam project on the Danube River,
the government news agency said.
   The CTK news agency said 100,000 people from Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Austria formed the chain across territory in all three
nations.
   Meanwhile, thousands of West Germans and Czechoslovak citizens
formed a 2.5-mile human chain across their common border in a
gesture of triumph over the waning divisions between East and West,
CTK said.
   Tens of thousands of them passed through the border crossing
where the chain was formed, drawing attention to the ``absurdity of
the Iron Curtain,'' CTK said.
   Hard-line Communist regimes have been replaced by reformist
governments in Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the past two years
that have opened their borders with the West. While much of Eastern
Europe's ``Iron Curtain'' has been torn down, the continent remains
divided by the NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances.
   Among those taking part was Czechoslovakia's foreign minister,
former dissident Jiri Dienstbier. He was quoted as saying that a
joint commmission to discuss the opening of new border crossings
between the two countries would meet next week.
   In the hydroelectric dam protest, CTK said that up to 100,000
people helped form a human chain along the Danube over a span of
about 100 miles from the town of Hainburg in Austria, across to
Bratislava in Czechoslovakia and to Komarom in Hungary.
   Hungary's Parliament already voted to scrap its part of the
joint dam project with Czechoslovakia, and the new Prague
leadership has said it will review the environmental consequences
of its part of the power plant at Gabcikovo.
   Activists read aloud a letter addressed to Czechoslovak
President Vaclav Havel, requesting his support for the demands that
the project be stopped, MTI reported. Participants also called for
Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to create a nature reserve
along the Danube, MTI said.
   In the Hungarian town of Visegrad, Andras Szekfue of the
Hungarian Green Party told about 100 people that since the
Hungarian part of the project at Nagymaros had been scrapped, they
must help the Czechoslovaks stop the dam at Gabcikovo, a
participant told The Associated Press.
   
   Referring to the democratic revolutions that have swept the East
bloc, Szekfue added: ``The good thing is that we no longer need to
work in secret but can pursue our aims with democratic means.''
   In the Hungarian city of Esztergom, activist Csaba Paska noted,
``the Danube links the people (of the three countries), and this
dam which divides us was the work of politicians.''
   Among placards and banners carried by protesters was one
reading, ``Build bridges, not dams.''
   Austrian and Hungarian environmentalists had long opposed the
mammoth project, maintaining it would destroy unique wildlife and
have other irreparable consequences for the Danube.
   The project was agreed on by the Communist governments in Prague
and Budapest in the 1970s. Austria had agreed to finance part of
the Hungarian project in exchange for electricity.
   The chain across the West German-Czechoslovak border was formed
between the Czechoslovak town of Zlezna Ruda and the West German
border town of Bayrisch Eisenstein, about 100 miles northeast of
Munich.

<HEAD>Report: Bradley's Political Mentor Got Thousands Through City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley's political mentor received
$336,000 in federal funds through the city to renovate a building
he owned through a non-existent corporation, The Los Angeles Times
reported Saturday.
   The City Council granted loans to Bishop H. Hartford Brookins
between 1982 and 1985, apparently in violation of city bidding
procedure and despite Brookins' refusal to provide financial
information on some occasions, the Times reported, citing city
officials and government records.
   In addition, an aide to Bradley repeatedly asked two city
administrators to grant special help to the bishop, the officials
said.
   A spokesman for Brookins referred questions about the matter to
attorney J. Stanley Sanders, who said he did not know enough about
it to comment.
   Bradley declined to be interviewed about Brookins, but the
mayor's spokesman, Bill Chandler, said Bradley never spoke about
the Brookins loan and said it ``never came to his attention'' until
after it was repaid in 1988.
   The money came in the form of federally funded contracts,
administered by the city's Community Development Department, to
renovate a three-story building Brookins owns in southwest Los
Angeles.
   Loan records indicate the building today is worth about $1
million.
   Brookins used some of the money to pay off $30,000 in ``personal
obligations,'' according to district attorney investigative reports
cited by the Times.
   In July, the district attorney's office dropped a two-year
investigation into the loans because the statute of limitations for
fraud and embezzlement had elapsed.
   Last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
referred the Brookins case to its regional Office of Inspector
General for possible investigation of misuse of government funds,
HUD spokesman Scott Reed said.
   Brookins was the regional bishop of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church from 1976 to 1984. He engineered Bradley's first
campaign for City Council in 1963 and has been chairman or
co-chairman of every campaign since.
   ``I mean literally, if I may, I almost hand-carried Bradley up
his whole political career,'' Brookins said in a 1985 interview.
Brookins currently is AME Church bishop for Maryland, Virginia and
Washington, D.C.
   The building was owned by the Southern California African
Methodist Episcopal Church Inc., of which Brookins is listed as
sole corporate director. But the secretary of state's office said
the firm was never incorporated in California.
   In 1982, the City Council instructed the Community Development
Department to loan $238,000 to the company to renovate the
building. No competing projects were considered, said Douglas S.
Ford, the CDD's former general manager.
   ``The reality was that (Brookins) was politically connected and
the contract came down through those channels, and we were in a
position where we had to implement it,'' CDD analyst Arnold C.
Garcia said.
   Brookins received more money from the City Council when the
project ran out of funds in 1985, bringing the total to $336,000,
records show.
   CDD analyst Richard Gallegos said supervisors ordered him to
release the additional funds, even though Brookins had failed to
provide property deeds, loan papers and other required documents
for the contract.
   ``I was told pressure was coming from the mayor's office and we
got to get this contract out,'' he said.

   A violent windstorm gusting up to 104 mph battered
northern France on Saturday, tearing off roofs, cutting rail
service in several areas and leaving more than 2 million people
without electricity. At least 18 were killed.
   Among the buildings damaged was the 12th century cathedral at
Chartres, one of the world's most magnificent Gothic structures.
The wind peeled copper plates from the roof, leaving a
540-square-foot hole over the nave between the two bell towers of
the church, 50 miles southwest of the capital.
   In western England, the rain-swollen Severn river rose 14 feet
above normal and flooded towns and farmland along its banks. The
riverside city of Worcester, 100 miles northwest of London, had its
worst flooding in 25 years.
   Winds tore across Brittany, Normandy and the Paris regions,
damaging roofs, blowing trees and electric lines across railways
and roads, and disrupting air traffic.
   The St. Lazare railroad station in Paris, France's busiest, was
closed about 2 p.m. and all rail service to Normandy cut off
because of downed trees on tracks.
   Service also was cut between Paris and Rennes, capital of
Brittany. As many as 5,000 passengers had to be transported in
buses.
   Service was severely disrupted both at Charles de Gaulle and
Orly airports in Paris, with only occasional takeoffs during the
afternoon.
   The national Civil Defense office said at least 18 people died
as a result of the storm, although the circumstances of all the
deaths were not immediately known.
   A 75-year-old woman died in Rosny-sous-Bois when a bar from a
shutter blew across a room and hit her in the head, fire department
headquarters said. In Alfortville, a young man was killed by a
fence post that hit him on the head.
   A motorcyclist was killed in the city of Moulins when he was hit
in the head by a flying tree branch, and a truck driver died when a
gust turned over his vehicle in the Ille-et-Vilaine region.
   The windstorm even delayed races at Vincennes Racetrack and
forced closure of the Vincennes Zoo, where keepers put the animals
indoors.
   The Paris Fire Department also said the wind caused the glass
covering of a swimming pool at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges to explode,
injuring about 15 children with flying glass.

<HEAD>March Commemorating Stroessner Coup Anniversary Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police blocked a march by the largest
opposition party Saturday, the first anniversary of the military
coup that toppled dictator Alfredo Stroessner.
   ``On the day that commemorates the end of an oppressive
dictatorship ... they prohibit us from freely walking in the
streets,'' said Domingo Laino, who was jailed and exiled by Gen.
Stroessner but won a seat in Congress in national elections last
May.
   The government did not say why they banned the peaceful
demonstration by several hundred members of the Authentic Radical
Liberal Party.
   ``The march is prohibited by the Ministry of the Interior, and I
have precise orders to act to bar it,'' said police Gen. Francisco
Sanchez.
   No clashes or injuries were reported.
   The police action was at odds with the generally improved
climate of civil liberties since Stroessner was overthrown by his
top general, Andres Rodriguez, on Feb. 3, 1989. Three months later,
Rodriguez overwhelmingly was elected president.
   In interviews last week, political, labor and human rights
leaders said the Rodriguez government was upholding civil rights
and democratic liberties although it was clear Stroessner's
Colorado Party and the armed forces still dominate government and
commerce.
   ``We enjoy freedom of thought and expression,'' said Eduardo
Escobar, a leader of the Pro Demos human rights group. ``That is an
important achievement and an essential element in the process
toward democracy.''
   ``People are exercising their liberties _ calling radio stations
about abuses, complaining about increased bus fares. This didn't
happen before,'' said Benjamin Arditti, a political analyst. ``My
concern is that political leaders aren't moving as fast as the
desire for change.''
   Rodriguez, 66, began the coup the night of Feb. 2, 1989.
Stroessner surrendered before dawn the next day, after he was
pinned down by tanks at the presidential escort battalion and
several hundred soldiers defending him had been killed.
   On Friday, Rodriguez urged Paraguayans to bury any bitterness
they may have for the past.
   In brief comments to reporters, Rodriguez said the anniversary
``is a day for reflection. ... I would like people to raise a
prayer for the fallen.''
   ``I hope we may forget rancors, hatreds, jealousy, selfishness
and passions in order to live in peace and harmony,'' he said.
``May our prayers serve as a just remembrance for those who offered
their lives for the liberty and democracy'' Paraguayans now enjoy.

<HEAD>Vultures' Attraction For Vinyl Seats Vexes Boat Owners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unexplained attraction vultures have
for vinyl seat covers has led a group of wealthy homeowners to seek
expert help to chase away the bothersome buzzards.
   Len and Sandy Wilkerson moved to Kissimmee's exclusive Regal Bay
neighborhood because they love wildlife: Osprey, white ibis and
great blue herons stop on a small island in the neighborhood's
manmade lake.
   Flocks of ugly vultures also are drawn to the area, spoiling the
natural serenity of the $500,000 homes, said Sandy Wilkerson,
   ``They're always on my back porch,'' she said. ``The other day
they were sitting up on the railing, staring at the cats. It was
like the movie `The Birds.'''
   Besides their unsightliness, the flying freeloaders cause
between $50 and $500 in property damage each month.
   For reasons unexplainable even to bird experts, vultures seem to
be attracted to the smell of vinyl that cover most of the boat
seats.
   ``They're vicious,'' said resident Judy Foster. ``They pick at
the screens, the shingles, and the boat seats. ... They rip apart
the boat seats.''
   The Regal Bay Homeowners Association, determined to avoid Walt
Disney World's environmental blunder with vultures last year, went
straight to the experts.
   In January Disney paid $95,000 to settle 16 animal cruelty
charges against five of its employees after the company was charged
last summer with shooting, starving, dehydrating, harassing and
beating vultures to death.
   In Regal Bay's case, a federal nuisance control officer _ sort
of a vulture vigilante _ arrived Tuesday and bombed the tiny island
with fireworks for two nights to scare the vultures away.
   Soon after the noise died down, the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission showed up.
   It seems two neighbors, members of the same homeowners group,
called the state agency to complain that the action against the
vultures was scaring off the other birds sharing the island.
   Bob Sauls, a state wildlife officer, said after a quick survey
of the situation Thursday, ``I can see right off the bat, there are
going to be problems.''

<HEAD>Financial Deals Cost AMA Thousands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief executive of the American Medical
Association was one of four top staff members of the organization
who benefited from a decade of money-losing financial deals,
according to a published report.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported in early Sunday editions that the
AMA lost $45,000 when it purchased the suburban Inverness home of
Dr. James H. Sammons. The association paid $280,000 for the home in
1984 and sold it the next year for $235,000.
   Sammons, the association's chief executive officer, later moved
into a Chicago high-rise condominium owned by the AMA, where he
paid below-market rent, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified
sources.
   The AMA lost $23,000 after purchasing the Wheaton home of Joe D.
Miller for $170,000 in 1980 and selling it later for $147,000.
Miller retired at the end of 1982.
   Relocation experts said corporations expect to lose 5 percent to
6 percent buying and reselling a house, but the AMA lost 16 percent
on Sammons' home and 13.5 percent on Miller's home, the newspaper
said.
   The AMA's board of trustees released a statement Friday that
said the purchases of Miller's and Sammons' residences ``were
authorized by the board of trustees, at prices arrived at by
independent outside appraisals, and they were for the convenience
and benefit of the association.''
   The newspaper quoted unidentified AMA trustees who served in
1980 and 1984 saying they did not recall being told the group was
buying the homes of Sammons and Miller.
   Sammons has been under fire in recent months following the
disclosures of various financial decisions. In December, the AMA
board of directors curtailed Sammons' broad financial discretion
and announced that he would retire in 1991.
   In a 1987 deal, the AMA reimbursed its chief operating officer,
Whalen M. Strobhar, $353,000 to cover stock market loses to his
pension-fund investments. Strobhar resigned and later repaid the
amount with interest.
   The doctors' group lost $65,000 in 1989 when it foreclosed on a
loan to Assistant Vice President Richard Noffke. He was loaned
about $267,000 to buy a Chicago condo.
   Sammons did not inform the board of the stock-loss bailout and
foreclosure settlement he had authorized.
   The Chicago-based AMA's 280,000 members account for about half
the doctors in the United States.

   Police and federal agents Saturday
displayed more than two tons of cocaine seized in a raid on an
Orange County warehouse, but there were no arrests made,
authorities said.
   The estimated wholesale value of the 4,719 pounds of cocaine was
nearly $36.5 million, said FBI spokesman Jim Neilson.
   The drug, neatly wrapped in banded boxes on pallets in a truck
and secured with shrink-wrap plastic, was seized late Friday from
an unoccupied warehouse that was apparently a distribution center,
Neilson said.
   Orange County sheriff's investigators and police from Gardena
and Santa Ana took part in the raid, the latest in a series of
ton-load cocaine seizures in Southern California.
   In December, 2{ tons of the drug were seized in raids in Los
Angeles and San Bernardino counties. In September, a world-record
20 tons was seized at a warehouse in the Sylmar section of Los
Angeles.

   AIDS is spreading nearly twice as fast among

   More than 11,500 new cases of the deadly disease were reported

   The United States had the biggest share of new cases, 4,500.
Brazil and Tanzania recorded about 1,500 each, and Italy reported
644 new cases.
   In Europe, total reported cases rose to 29,727 by the end of
January.
   A special World Health Organization survey of the continent
found a sharp rise in acquired immune deficiency syndrome among
intravenous drug users in the year ending last September. Reported
cases in that group grew by 103 percent, compared to a 55 percent
rise among homosexual and bisexual men.
   The report did not specify the countries where the increases
occurred.
   But it noted that AIDS spread especially rapidly over the
one-year period in Spain and Italy, where about two-thirds of all
reported victims are intravenous drug users.
   According to the survey, the biggest number of cases per week
were recorded in France, followed by Spain and Italy.
   AIDS destroys the body's immune system, leaving it vulnerable to
other disease. There is no known cure.
   Despite the shifting trends, homosexuals and bisexuals still
account for 49 percent of all European cases reported over the
years until Sept. 30, the World Health Organization said. Drug
users were 30 percent of the total.
   Switzerland continued to report the continent's highest number
of cases per capita, 158.5 per million inhabitants. France, Spain
and Denmark were next hardest-hit.
   European women who contracted AIDS were younger than men, the
survey said. The percentage of European heterosexuals, both men and
women, with the disease has grown from 6.6 percent in 1986 to 8.8
percent last year, the health agency said.

   More than 40,000 high school and university students
marched through Rome on Saturday to demand reform in the Italian
educational system.
   ``We want to study, we want jobs, so the schools must change,''
the students shouted.
   The peaceful demonstration was organized by a group of Naples
high school students angered by the decision of the national
Education Ministry not to include many students in a convention on
the Italian school system.
   Many of the Naples students belonged to the youth group of the
Communist Party, Italy's biggest opposition party, newspapers
reported.
   The students demanded that studies be updated to reflect changes
in society and that the government not reduce its commitment to
schools under a new plan granting them more autonomy.
   The plan would allow businesses to become more involved in
higher education, and the protesters say private industry
utlimately would have too much influence at state-run universities.

<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army's political
wing on Saturday discussed how to broaden its voter appeal, while
demonstrators outside brought a coffin and signs saying ``The IRA
Kills Democracy.''
   The annual convention of the Sinn Fein party came a week after
an IRA bomb accidentally killed a 16-year-old boy in Londonderry,
Northern Ireland.
   Although Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said a year ago that
such ``mistakes'' were retarding the cause of a united Ireland,
there was no repeat this year of his call for the IRA to be
``careful and careful again.''
   Instead, Adams asserted that the mainly Catholic IRA was winning
in its 21-year-old battle to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Republic of Ireland. He called on the British government to open
unconditional negotiations.
   Peter Brooke, Britain's top official in Northern Ireland, a
British province, said recently that talks could be considered only
after the IRA campaign ended.
   Outside the Mansion House, where Ireland's first legislature met
in 1919, the armed campaign was denounced by members of the Irish
Peace Council and New Consensus, a group that was formed to protest
IRA bombings of the Dublin-Belfast railway line.
   ``One percent is no consent,'' said one placard, referring to
Sinn Fein's share _ actually 1.2 percent _ in last summer's
elections in the Republic of Ireland.
   Within Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's share of the vote has
slipped from 13.4 percent in 1983 to 11.3 percent in 1989. It
consisently runs behind the Social Democratic and Labor Party in
competition for votes from the province's Roman Catholic minority.
   ``We need to consider why we are not as strong as we could be,''
Adams told the convention. ``We have not done and are not doing
sufficient political work.''
   The party was midway through a three-day debate on a political
report that proposed a more active publicity effort ``to defeat
black propaganda about republicanism'' and to emphasize to
Protestants that they would not be excluded from a united Ireland.
   It proposed to support divorce, which is outlawed in the
Republic and is a sore point between Protestants and Catholics.
   The report said the underlying cause of poverty, unemployment
and emigration is ``British imperialism and partition of our
country.''
   Party officials say they have been hurt by being banned from
appearing on British TV and radio _ they are also banned in Ireland
_ but they admit that IRA killings of innocent civilians have hurt.
   Since Adams' appeal last year, the IRA's victims have included a
20-year-old woman killed when a bomb exploded prematurely, a
52-year-old Belfast man mistaken for someone else, a 26-year-old
German wife of a British soldier and a 6-month-old baby shot to
death in the arms of her soldier father in West Germany.
   A week ago, 16-year-old Charles Love was fatally injured by a
piece of stone dislodged by a bomb 500 yards away on the city wall
of Londonderry. He was attending a march commemorating 13 people
shot to death by the British Army in 1972 during a civil rights
march.

<TEXT>
   A radical Palestinian group said Israeli
troops killed two of its guerrillas during a clash Saturday in
Israel's self-proclaimed buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
   The Palestinian Liberation Front claimed killing ``several''
Israeli soldiers in the fight, but an Israeli army spokesman denied
any army casualties.
   The group, led by terrorist mastermind Mohammed Abbas, better
known as Abul Abbas, said in a communique that one of its guerrilla
squads clashed with an Israeli patrol in Ein Ebl on the northern
edge of the zone.
   It said the three-man squad was heading out on an anti-Israeli
``combat mission'' inside the Israeli-occupied Palestinian
territories when they were confronted by the patrol.
   ``Our heroes engaged the enemy in a pitched battle that left
several enemy soldiers killed or wounded and destroyed a half-track
armor vehicle,'' the communique said.
   The communique, issued in Beirut, said two of the guerrillas
were killed and that the third was wounded but managed to return to
base.
   Israel maintains about 1,000 troops, with armor and artillery,
in the six- to 10-mile buffer zone carved out when the Israelis
withdrew the bulk of their army in 1985, three years after it
invaded.

<TEXT>
   The nation's 2,800 dockworkers went on
strike Saturday, paralyzing Greece's ports.
   The dockworkers are demanding an extra $50 a day for handling
hazardous loads, as well as improved pension and health insurance
plans.
   The Union of Port Employees of Greece says it expects the strike
to last at least a week.
   The dockworkers have staged repeated strikes and slowdowns in
recent weeks. Some freighters have been redirected to other
European ports while others languish at Greek docks.
   In an interview with the Greek daily newspaper Ethnos, Spiros
Marinakis, president of the International Shipping Union _ a group
representing firms in Athens _ said the strikes are causing serious
long-term damage to Greek shipping.
   Greece has been plagued by labor unrest since last month, when
the government announced austerity measures to battle an annual
inflation rate of nearly 15 percent and a $1.6 billion budget
deficit.
   Bus drivers, electricians and television and bank employees have
called slowdowns for this week, and the national confederation of
labor unions has threatened to hold its second general strike of
the year in mid-February.

   Masked gunmen bound and gagged unarmed
guards early Saturday at Herculaneum, a Roman city destroyed when
Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., and stole hundreds of treasures,
news reports said.
   Baldassare Conticello, the superintendent of the archaeological
areas of Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii, said the inventory of the
stolen goods was still incomplete, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.
   The missing items included about 200 gold bracelets and
earrings, a first century bronze vase in the form of a woman's head
and a 32-inch silver-and-copper inlaid bronze statue of Bacchus, he
said.
   At least four bandits wearing ski masks surprised four night
watchmen at their station, AGI quoted investigators as saying. The
custodians were forced at gunpoint to turn over the keys to a
building that houses hundreds of artifacts, the news agency said.
   It said the custodians were tied up and their mouths taped with
bandages. After a few hours, one of the guards was able to free
himself and sounded an alarm.
   Conticello said sale of the stolen goods would be difficult
since they were cataloged. But he said it was possible someone had
commissioned the holdup to enrich a personal collection.
   Walter Mazzitti, the head of Archeoclub of Italy, an
organization of people interested in archaeology, decried what he
called a lack of adequate security at major ruins in the Naples
area and syggested that guards there should be armed.
   Herculaneum, along the Bay of Naples and with the volcano at its
back, included the villas of wealthy ancient Romans. Its ruins,
discovered in 1709, are considered better preserved than those at
the more extensive complex at Pompeii, which was also destroyed by
Mount Vesuvius' eruption.

<HEAD>Topeka School Board to Appeal Desegregation Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court will be asked to
review this city's progress in desegregating its schools after the
landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision declaring
segregated schools unconstitutional, it was announced Saturday.
   Board of Education members told a news conference they will
appeal a lower court ruling that held Topeka schools were not
sufficiently integrated.
   The board decided to appeal because it felt the district was
integrated and wanted to maintain local control of the school
system, said Superintendent Gary Livingston.
   ``Children want the right to go to school where they live,''
Livingston said.
   Plaintiffs' attorney Richard Jones said he was disappointed by
the decision.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that segregated schools deprived
black children of equal educational opportunities and reinforced
the concept that blacks were inferior.
   A black railroad worker, Oliver Brown, had sued the school
district because his daughter was not allowed to attend an
all-white school near their home.
   The case was reopened in 1979 by the parents of 17 black
schoolchildren, who alleged the district had not desegregated
schools.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers ruled against the plaintiffs
in 1987, but was overruled by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The school board said it feared a court would order busing in
the district if the appeals court ruling was not appealed.
   ``I think that's a possibility,'' said Joe Zima, attorney for
the board. ``We're not there yet, but if we don't appeal it, we'll
be there.''

   A teen-age girl was in critical condition
Saturday after becoming the world's first recipient of an implant
consisting of a slender bundle of fibers that works like a lung in
supplying oxygen to the body.
   The 20-inch device _ designed to give damaged lungs a chance to
rest and recover before it is removed _ was implanted in a two-hour
operation Friday at LDS Hospital, one of four U.S. centers approved
for testing of the IntraVascular Oxygenator.
   ``This patient could live and the device could be useless,'' Dr.
Alan Morris, the hospital's director of pulmonary research, said at
an afternoon news conference. ``She could pass away and it could be
a perfectly useful device.''
   Morris emphasized that it was far too early to evaluate the
devices's performance. ``There is a grave risk of
misrepresentation,'' he said, if the mechanism is seen as anything
more than an experiment.
   The IVOX is not an artificial lung but could lead to development
of such a device, said its developer, Dr. J.D. Mortensen.
   The family insisted that no details about the patient be made
public, but sources confirmed the recipient was a teen-age girl
with acute respiratory failure. The Salt Lake Tribune reported she
is 16.
   Morris described the patient as ``a suffering individual whose
privacy must be protected at all costs'' for research protocol and
ethical reasons.
   Hospital spokesman Richard Nash said only that the patient was
in critical condition. The device was implanted by Dr. Roger C.
Millar.
   Although he assisted in the surgery, Mortensen would not discuss
particulars of the implant, which involved insertion of the device
via the neck or groin into the inferior vena cava, the large vein
that brings blood to the heart.
   Two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the
bundle and leave the body; one delivers oyxgen to the body from a
hospital oxygen system or tank, the other removes carbon dioxide, a
waste product of breathing.
   Mortensen said the initial experiments will involve only
patients with acute lung disease, such as pneumonia or smoke
inhalation, not long-term, chronic disorders such as cystic
fibrosis or emphysema.
   The only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an
extracorporeal oxygenator, a large machine that requires pumping
the blood outside the body.
   Guidelines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
September limit the implants to seven days in people with acute
respiratory failure who have little other chance of survival.
   ``In patients with acute lung failure, the natural lungs can
recover in four to five days if given a chance to rest,'' Mortensen
said. If they do not recover by then, ``they probably aren't going
to. ... You have dead lungs.''
   The developer of the IVOX, CardioPulmonics Inc. of Salt Lake
City, announced Jan. 11 the device would be tested in 10 patients
at LDS Hospital, Penn State's Hershey Medical Center, the
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, and the Los
Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center.
Several centers in Europe and Japan have applied to test the device.
   Mortensen said about eight of the 10 initial human recipients
were expected to die from their illnesses.
   Mortensen said the IVOX acts much like the natural membranes in
the air sacs of the lungs. The device is an inch-wide bundle of 900
to 1,200 hollow fibers each about the thickness of a human hair.
The polypropylene fibers have porous walls. The bundle is covered
with a super-thin plastic membrane.
   As the IVOX floats in the blood flowing through the vena cava,
oxygen passes through the fiber walls into the oxygen-poor blood.
Meanwhile, carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the fiber
wall into the hollow fiber.
   Mortensen said the initial human experiments are to determine
IVOX's safety, not effectiveness.
   ``These are extremely sick patients that have advanced lung
disease, whose lungs are unable to support life, and are in the
process of dying from their lung disease,'' he said. ``We're trying
to see if the device will cause further complications for the
patient.
   ``If it does not, then the FDA will release it for testing on
healthier patients.''
   The IVOX was made possible by membrane technology that allows
much higher concentrations of oxygen through the tiny polypropylene
tubes. In animal tests lasting up to 19 days, the IVOX did not
damage the blood or organs of 150 sheep and dogs.
   LDS Hospital, once named Latter-day Saints Hospital when it was
owned by the Mormon Church, is a few miles from the University of
Utah Health Sciences Center, where doctors in 1982 implanted the
world's first permanent artificial heart in a human.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection went faster than
expected for the trial of Joseph Hazelwood, the ex-captain of the
Exxon Valdez blamed for the nation's worst oil spill, clearing the
way for opening arguments Monday.
   The 12 jurors and three alternates are to be sworn in Monday for
the criminal trial of Hazelwood, who was in command of the tanker
when it struck a Prince William Sound reef last March and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   Attorneys for Hazelwood and the state had expected jury
selection would take two weeks because of publicity about the
accident that polluted pristine waters, tarred shorelines, killed
wildlife and disrupted fishing.
   But by lunchtime Friday, the fourth day of jury screening, the
court had a panel of 12 members from among 52 candidates questioned
in Hazelwood's criminal trial.
   He faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor
charges of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and
operating a vessel while intoxicated. Conviction on all charges
could produce a maximum penalty of seven years, three months in
prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Some prospective jurors were excused immediately after they said
they held opinions about Hazelwood. Others were eliminated after
questioning which determined they could not set aside their
conclusions about the case.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone said toward the end of the
selection process that the number of candidates whose acceptability
went unchallenged by attorneys was high. Of 44 people questioned,
27 were in that category, he said.
   Although everyone questioned knew of the oil spill, most said
they had little or no opinion about it. Johnstone said he found
that hard to believe, but added that such statements made under
oath had to be accepted as the truth.
   The judge granted attorneys for both sides extra peremptory
challenges that allowed them to rule out candidates without saying
why.
   Hazelwood attorney Dick Madson said he needed additional
challenges in part because two of the potential jurors were so
familiar with the case they practically qualified as witnesses.
   In granting the state an extra challenge, Johnstone said he
detected ``an undercurrent of feeling by jurors that perhaps there
are others who are responsible for this (Exxon Valdez) incident,
including the state.''
   District Attorney Brent Cole had not used his extra challenge by
the time the jury was chosen.
   Madson said the jury represents a good cross-section of the
Anchorage-area population. Occupations of jurors include mail
carrier, cook, homemaker, business executive, engineer, grocer,
real estate agent and child-care worker. The trial that began with
preliminary matters last Monday and then moved into jury selection
could last six weeks or more.
   It originally was scheduled for October in Valdez, the port from
which the tanker sailed just hours before the crash. The trial was
moved to Anchorage in the interest of obtaining a fair proceeding,
although Madson proposed Fairbanks or Palmer as better locations.
   In deciding the venue, Johnstone said that if Oliver North could
get a fair trial despite the vast publicity his case received, then
Hazelwood could get a fair proceeding in Anchorage.
   Lawyers for Hazelwood, who was absent from the tanker's bridge
when the vessel ran aground, are expected to argue that he left
adequate instructions for crew members and cannot be held
criminally responsible for their actions. The state's attorneys
refused to discuss the case and Cole has not revealed his plans.

   A boy who authorities said tried to rob a
grocery store customer with an unloaded gun became the third
teen-ager in a week shot to death by police.
   In Brooklyn, where police fatally shot two unarmed teen-agers on
Jan. 27 and Wednesday, residents held a largely peaceful march
Saturday that ended with a demonstration at a stationhouse.
   The latest shooting came Friday night in Harlem when 13-year-old
Robert Cole was shot after he refused to drop a .32-caliber handgun
after trying to rob a man in a grocery, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a
police spokesman.
   Cole, who was carrying 35 vials of what appeared to be crack,
was struck in the chest by a bullet fired by Officer Larry Walton,
31, Vreeland said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.
   Cole was the eighth person fatally shot by police in the first
five weeks of this year. In 1989, 30 people were killed by police;
in 1988, 25 died and in 1987, 14.
   Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, who took office just last
month, said Friday he wants officers to spend more time in the
communities they protect to gain a better understanding of
residents.
   Saturday's march concluded with a rally outside a Brooklyn
stationhouse, where about 300 demonstrators called for the
suspension without pay of Officer Frank Albergo, who fatally shot
14-year-old Jose Lebron on Wednesday.
   Lebron, suspected in a $10 robbery, was killed when Albergo
thought he saw the unarmed teen-ager reaching into his coat and
feared he was going for a gun, police said.
   Four days earlier and five blocks away, 17-year-old Louis
Liranso was shot in the back and killed by an officer after the
unarmed Liranso allegedly lowered his hands and turned toward the
officer.
   In Friday's slaying, police said Cole and an accomplice tried to
rob a 42-year-old grocery store customer, but the man got Cole's
gun away from him. Cole fled, got another gun and began chasing the
man. The customer escaped by flagging down an ambulance, but the
boy continued after it, police said.
   When the ambulance arrived at its destination, an accident scene
about three blocks from the grocery store, the customer told
officers there what had happened. The boy arrived, officers ordered
him at least twice to drop his gun, but the boy kept advancing and
raised the gun, Vreeland said.
   It turned out that the gun used in the attempted robbery and the
gun Cole had later were unloaded, he said.

   For the 31,517th and final time, Bill
Shoemaker failed to win a horse race, but the 58-year-old jockey
still entered his retirement Saturday as the world's winningest
rider.
   Shoemaker rode a horse named Patchy Groundfog to a fourth-place
finish in a one-time-only stakes race at Santa Anita called the
Legend's Last Ride.
   The $7,500 pot for fourth place in the 11-horse field boosted
Shoemaker's career earnings to $123,375,524 on a record of 8,833
victories, 6,136 seconds and 4,987 thirds in 40,350 starts.
   It looked briefly as if Shoemaker would post win No. 8,834 when
he put Patchy Groundfog into the lead at the top of the stretch of
the one-mile stakes on the grass. The crowd roared, but just as
quickly as Patchy Groundfog got the lead, he lost it.
   In the stretch run, Shoemaker got Patchy Groundfog into the lead
as the race caller shouted, ``Come on, Shoe.'' But it was not to be.
   Exemplary Leader surged past on the inside and won over Happy
Toss. Oraibi edged Patchy Groundfog by a head for third.
   Shoemaker was honored at a ceremony before the race, and then to
warm applause and chants of ``Shoe, Shoe, Shoe.'' Patchy Groundfog
carried the Shoe onto the racetrack for the final time at 2:32 p.m.
   At the pre-race ceremony, Shoemaker said, ``One more race to go.
I want to thank all you fans who supported me all these years.''
   Shoemaker will turn to training horses. He passed his trainer's
license test Wednesday.

   A bishop claiming to be the new Armenian
patriarch of Jerusalem barricaded himself in a monastery with
submachine gun-toting bodyguards and officials protested to police
Saturday, a church spokesman said.
   Bishop Shahe Ajemian entered the St. James convent and monastery
Friday, a day after the death of Patriarch Yeghishe Derderian and
reportedly declared himself successor.
   The Armenian patriarch is the spiritual leader of 8,000 Armenian
Christians in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan. He is also
one of the custodians of Jerusalem's holy places, along with the
Greek Orthodox and Latin patriarchs.
   A church spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Ajemian
was surrounded by eight Israeli bodyguards carrying Uzi submachine
guns. He said the Israelis worked for a private security company
and had no connection to the government.
   The spokesman said the church issued a formal complaint to
Police Minister Chaim Bar Lev concerning the violation of church
grounds.
   Ajemian was expelled from the brotherhood of the monastery in
1982 after a series of scandals and is ineligible for the role of
patriarch.
   ``This man was dismissed from the brotherhood, but he keeps
trying to enter by wicked means,'' said Albert Alghazarian, a
prominent member of the Armenian community. ``He can do or say
whatever he wants, but he can not even legitimately enter the room
where the voting will take place.''
   The 60 members of the worldwide Brotherhood of St. James are
expected to elect a new patriarch within 40 days of the death of
Derderian. The 80-year-old patriarch died of a heart attack after
being ill with influenza for two days, officials said.
   Bishop Guregh Kapikian has been named acting patriarch.
   The Armenian Church is an eastern rite church organized along
ethnic lines and does not accept the authority of the pope.
   There are about 7.5 million Armenians worldwide, including 1
million in the United States.

<HEAD>Costa Ricans Ready For Quadrennial Civic Fiesta</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Flag-waving crowds vied
good-naturedly in the streets of this capital as Costa Ricans got
worked up for Sunday's presidential election _ a civic fiesta.
   ``It is very satisfying to return to Costa Rica, especially as
an election observer,'' said Joao Baena Soares, secretary general
of the Organization of American States.
   Baena Soares arrived Friday from neighboring Nicaragua, where
the bitter and controversial election campaign sharply contrasts
with Costa Rica's friendly democratic tradition.
   Rafael Angel Calderon of the Social Christian party was
considered a slight favorite over Carlos Manuel Castillo of the
incumbent National Liberation party. The winner will take office on
May 8.
   Five minor candidates together are expected to garner less than
5 percent of the vote.
   Voters will also elect 57 National Assembly delegates and 525
mayors. More than 80 percent of the nation's 1.6 million registered
voters are expected to cast ballots.
   Luis Fishman, a top Calderon aide, said Saturday that the latest
party poll indicated a substantial victory for his candidate, while
Castillo said he would win by a slim 25,000 votes.
   By another of the many gentlemen's agreements that rule Costa
Rican politics, no independent poll has been conducted since Dec.
10, when Calderon had a 5 percent lead with 20 percent undecided.
   The candidates were clearly reluctant to speak ill of each other
during the campaign, although Calderon brought up embarrassing ties
to drug traffickers and Castillo mentioned that Calderon was born
in Nicaragua.
   In the narcotics case, a former National Liberation president
admitted accepting more than $100,000 from an indicted drug
trafficker. The case was thought to have hurt Castillo, but Fishman
said Calderon's main advantage is simply that National Liberation
has won the last two elections.
   ``No party has won three presidential elections in a row since
1948,'' noted Fishman. ``Costa Ricans don't like to leave one party
in power too long.''
   Castillo partisans counter that the country has experienced
eight years of good government under presidents Luis Alberto Monge
and Oscar Arias, including a recovery from economic doldrums in the
early 1980.
   Both major candidates support Arias' efforts to promote peace in
Central America, efforts that won him the Nobel Peace Prize. He
cannot run again, however.
   The Social Christian party appeared to be better organized and
funded for get-out-the-vote efforts. A national computer center was
prepared to tell uncertain voters where their precincts were
located.
   Also planned was a national youth poll, in which children vote
at local schools and go through exactly the same process as their
elders in an exercise to reinforce their understanding of and
commitment to democracy.
   On Saturday, cars swept through the city bearing partisans of
the major parties, with the green-and-white flags of National
Liberation or the red-and-blue of the Social Christians waving from
windows.
   Every evening for the last week crowds have gathered on the
streets to wave flags, chant, cheer and jeer, with the weekend
festivities lasting into the early morning hours.
   The 1990 vote will mark the 10th consecutive peaceful national
election for Costa Rica, a mark unmatched in Central America.

   Police arrested and carried away 143
abortion protesters Saturday after they locked the entrances to two
downtown abortion clinics with bicycle locks in an ``all-women's
rescue.''
   In an unrelated abortion protest, 35 men and one woman were
arrested Saturday morning outside a clinic in northeast
Philadelphia.
   Police Sgt. David Brown said the protesters were taken to the
Police Academy, where they were issued citations for trespassing.
   Abortion-rights supporters held counterdemonstrations at all
three sites, but Brown said there were no reports of violence.
   Jean Hunt, executive director of the Elizabeth Blackwell Health
Center For Women, one of the downtown clinics, said the protesters
harassed patients and closed the clinic's back doors with bicycle
locks that had to be cut off by the Fire Department.
   The protesters caused a ``massive disruption'' but did not deter
any of the 25 or so women with appointments Saturday from entering
the clinic, Hunt said.
   ``They can do this until the cows come home, we're still going
to be open for business,'' she said.
   Brown said about 120 women protested at the Planned Parenthood
clinic and 30 or 40 blocked the entrance to the Elizabeth Blackwell
clinic.
   Police arrested 143 protesters at the Elizabeth Blackwell clinic.
   The day's protests began at the Northeast Women's Center, where
mostly male protesters began arriving at 6:45 a.m., Brown said.
None of the counterdemonstrators was arrested, he said.

<HEAD>Report: Government Claims Mavinga Recaptured from UNITA Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Angolan army Saturday claimed its
forces recaptured a strategic airstrip from U.S.-backed rebels
after bitter fighting in southeastern Angola, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
   Lusa quoted an Angolan army statement and said it was the first
official admission of any military action near the Mavinga
airstrip. The communique said the Marxist government's troops were
``continuing punitive actions'' to the south of the town, Lusa
reported.
   In a dispatch from the Angolan capital, Luanda, Lusa quoted the
statement as saying government forces ``dislodged the bands of
UNITA from Mavinga'' Friday evening.
   The acronym stands for National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, the rebel group.
   Mavinga's airstrip is considered vital for control of the
southeastern region and the key for any government attack on rebel
headquarters at Jamba, more than 120 miles farther south toward the
Namibian border.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi denied in a statement released in
Lisbon Saturday that Mavinga had fallen.
   ``The situation is difficult, but Mavinga has not fallen into
the hands of the MPLA (government forces), and UNITA cannot, at any
price, allow (them) to occupy Mavinga,'' Savimbi said in the
statement.
   MPLA, or the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, is
the party of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   Norberto de Castro, the rebels' spokesman in Lisbon, said
Savimbi was directing operations in Mavinga under heavy air
bombardment. Savimbi cut short a five-nation European tour on
Tuesday to lead the fighting.
   An estimated 10,000 government soldiers began the drive on
Mavinga late in December.
   Washington has urged dos Santos' government to halt the attack,
and some U.S. congressmen have proposed an increase in military aid
to the rebels, who reportedly already receive $50 million a year.
   Diplomats in Luanda and Lisbon say the government would likely
use Mavinga to pressure the rebels in a new round of direct peace
talks, rather than push the military offensive toward Jamba.
   A first round of negotiations, that began after dos Santos and
Savimbi agreed to a truce in June, collapsed within weeks amid
renewed fighting.
   The rebels have been fighting for a power-sharing agreement
since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   They are demanding free elections, but Dos Santos' government is
offering amnesty and integration of the rebels into a single-party
state.

<HEAD>Greek Consul Ordered Expelled In Retaliation For Greek Expulsion
Of Turk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Saturday declared the Greek
consul general in Istanbul ``persona non grata'' and asked him to
leave the country within a week in retaliation for Athens'
expulsion of a Turkish consul.
   The Turkish consul ordered to leave was in Komotini, a town in
the Greek region of Western Thrace troubled by ethnic unrest by the
120,000-strong Moslem minority there.
   Both sides gave a week for the departure of the Turkish consul,
Kemal Gur, and the Greek diplomat, Elias Klis.
   ``The reprisal for Komotini is Istanbul,'' Turkish Foreign
Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted as saying Saturday.
   Greece said Friday that the Turkish consul was ``persona non
grata'' for referring to the Moslem minority as ``fellow
countrymen.'' Turkey had said earlier that Gur's phrase was
misunderstood because of a translation difficulty.
   A Foreign Ministry announcement on the issue said Greece's
decision to expel Gur was ``unjust and without any sound basis and
impossible to find reasonable.''
   ``The entire responsibility rests with Greece for our decision,
which we took reluctantly and with regret,'' it said.
   ``Racist attacks against the Turkish minority in Komotini will
not be forgotten,'' it added.
   Turkey insists the minority in Western Thrace is Moslem and of
Turkish origin. Greece recognizes them only as a religious minority
under the 1923 Lausanne treaty ending a four-year Turkish-Greek war.
   The recent troubles began when a Komotini court sentenced two
local Moslem politicians, Ahmet Sadik and Ibrahim Sherif, to 18
months in prison each for using the forbidden Turkish reference in
their latest election campaign.
   Moslems protesting the sentences clashed with Christians in
Komotini Monday and scores of shops belonging to Moslems were
damaged.
   Two years ago Greece and Turkey, long-feuding neighbors, started
a period of rapprochement when former premiers Turgut Ozal and
Andreas Papandreou agreed to try to negotiate their disputes, which
center on deciding the future of the Mediterranean island Cyprus.
The island is divided into Greek and Turkish sectors.
   Turkish papers claimed Saturday that the reconciliation had died
after the recent developments.

<HEAD>Nation of Islam Leader Tells Crowd: ``Stop the Killing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan
exhorted a crowd of more than 16,000 to ``stop the killing'' as he
spoke in the wake of a clash between local Black Muslims and
authorities that left a man dead.
   Farrakhan called for creation of a civilian review board to
investigate incidents like the Jan. 23 one between sheriff's
deputies and Muslims in which Oliver Beasley was shot to death.
   Sheriff's officials said Beasley, 27, was killed during a
struggle for a deputy's gun, but Farrakhan said Beasley was
executed.
   ``I have talked to eyewitnesses. They've told me that Oliver
Beasley was lying on the ground, he was bleeding, and the sheriff's
deputy looked down on him and blew his brains out,'' Farrakhan said
Friday night at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
   ``Our subject is stop the killing. Stop the killing,'' said the
national Muslim leader from Chicago. ``There's so much disrespect
for the single gift of life that it is sad in 1990 that someone has
to come along and ask us to stop those who have delighted in
killing us.''
   Farrakhan, who entered the arena to a standing ovation, called
on blacks to stop killing one another in violent street-gang
battles.
   ``Why can we take the trigger and pull it at each other?'' he
asked. ``We are killing ourselves. In the name of life, we are
worshipers of death.''
   Earlier Friday, the Los Angeles County coroner's office released
an autopsy report on Beasley saying he died of a gunshot would to
the head fired at point-blank range.
   Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman said that supported investigators'
contentions that Beasley was killed as he tried to take a deputy's
gun away.
   The incident following a routine traffic stop was the latest in
a series of confrontations that has strained relations between the
South Side's black communities and law enforcement officials.
   A 15-foot-high picture of Beasley hung behind the dias during
Farrakhan's speech, and Beasley's family sat on stage.
   In suggesting a police review board, he recommended it include
black, white, Hispanic and American Indian representatives.
   ``If you do this, you'll save the city from eruption,''
Farrakhan said. ``If you do not, people will say enough is enough
... If we reach a point where we can tolerate this abuse no longer,
we will rise up against your authority _ and we would rather die
than live like dogs under your roof.''
   Security was tight. More than 50 police officers were on hand,
and those entering the arena had to pass through metal detectors
and submit to pat-down searches by Nation of Islam members.

   A Coast Guard cutter that chased and fired on
a Cuban-operated freighter returned to port Saturday, and the
skipper said he was too cautious in failing to stop the ship for a
drug inspection.
   The Chincoteague tailed the 250-foot Hermann for 335 miles
beginning early Tuesday, when the cutter spotted the ship about 120
miles north of Merida on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   The chase ended 26 hours later with the Hermann escaping into
Mexican waters near Tampico after being hit about 50 times with a
volley of machine-gun fire from the U.S. ship.
   Cuban dictator Fidel Castro last week called the incident a
``grave provocation,'' but the Chincoteague's captain said he
should have done more to stop the freighter.
   ``I was probably too cautious. I took too long,'' said Lt. Todd
Gentile, commander of the 110-foot cutter. Gentile said Coast Guard
intelligence had told him the Hermann was carrying more than six
tons of cocaine.
   Cuban officials have said the Hermann, operated by the Guamar
Shipping Co. of Cuba but registered in Panama, carried 10 tons of
chromium. Mexican officials who searched the freighter at the
request of U.S. officials said they found no drugs.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the U.S. ship's
actions a ``legal law enforcement activity.''
   Gentile said the intent was not to hurt any of the 12 crew
members aboard the Hermann, but to stop the ship for a drug search.
No one aboard the Hermann was injured.
   At the news conference, the Coast Guard released a videotape of
the chase.
   ``I will be firing across the bow of your vessel,'' Gentile is
heard saying over a bullhorn. ``It is not my intention to harm you.
You must stop your vessel immediately.''
   The videotape shows the Chincoteague opening fire on the
Hermann, with shots pelting the ship's rudder and propeller area.
The videotape also shows crew members using large hoses to shoot
water at the Hermann in an attempt to flood its engine.
   Capt. Larry Hyde, commander of the Chincoteague's Mobile-based
group, said an initial review showed the cutter's 16-man crew acted
properly.
   Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington, previously
said officials from the State Department, Defense Department and
National Security Council held three meetings before giving
permission to open fire.
   Gentile said he was told he could fire on the freighter until it
was 15 miles off the coast of Mexico.
   ``We could have stopped the vessel if we'd wanted to, if we
didn't have to worry about the saving of lives,'' Hyde said.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Has $30 Billion In Unneeded Equipment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has stockpiled at least $30 billion
worth of excess, unneeded equipment, spare parts and uniforms _
including a 13,000-year supply of a machine tool, The New York
Times reported.
   The Pentagon has orders for another $1.8 billion in supplies it
doesn't need, the Times reported in Sunday editions.
   The information is contained in a Senate Budget Committee report
delivered to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Friday, the newspaper
said. The report was prepared by staff members of the
Democrat-controlled panel, and committee Democrats plan to question
Cheney about the stockpile on Monday, the Times said.
   ``This report has confirmed some of my worst fears,'' said Sen.
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn, and chairman of the committee. ``It appears to
me that we haven't made much progress from the days of the $400
hammers.''
   Pentagon officials disputed some of the report's specifics, the
Times said. The officials acknowledged a chronic, serious problem
with excess inventory, but said it is already being worked on.
   The report attributed the problem to inefficient management,
including a Pentagon unwillingness to throw away anything,
inadequate inventory control and a reluctance to cancel unneeded
orders, the Times said.
   Some examples cited in the study:
   _ In the past year, the Army was forced to buy 80,000 camouflage
helmet covers because officials couldn't locate ones they had
already bought _ until after the new order was delivered.
   _ The Navy has a 13,000-year supply of a machine tool used to
make circuits for the F-14 fighter jet.
   _ The Army has more than $3 million worth of women's long-sleeve
dress shirts sitting in a warehouse, while a new one of a heavier
material is being designed.
   _ Defense Logistics Agency warehouses store 150,000 pairs of
Korean War-vintage cold-weather pants.

   Armenian and Azerbaijani negotiators emerging from
their first talks Saturday expressed hope for a peaceful settlement
of their ethnic dispute but remained far apart on thorny
territorial claims.
   The representatives agreed to seek the release of all hostages
by March 1 and to establish permanent relations between the
Azerbaijani Popular Front and the Armenian National Movement.
   ``We have made the right first step,'' Sabit Bagirov, one of the
two Azerbaijani negotiators, said after the talks in the Latvian
capital of Riga.
   ``There is a certain success. We know each other better,'' said
Ashot Manucharian, one of the three Armenian negotiators.
   The negotiators met for more than nine hours on Friday and early
Saturday with mediators from the Baltic Council, which groups
leaders of the three people's front movements in the western
republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.
   The Azerbaijani and Armenian teams later convened for their
first face-to-face talks without the Baltic mediators in the
Writer's Union building in Riga.
   The talks continued into Saturday evening, Rihard Stankovs of
the Information Center of the Latvian People's Front said by
telephone from Riga. He said he did not know what the two sides had
discussed.
   The talks, held without the participation of the Soviet
government, were called after about 17,000 Soviet troops were sent
to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to quell ethnic violence that
erupted on Jan. 13.
   At least 214 people have been killed in clashes in the past
month and thousands of ethnic Armenians were chased from their
homes in Azerbaijan. Ethnic violence over the past two years has
created nearly 500,000 refugees in both southern republics.
   Both sides agreed late last month to truces along the border
between Armenia and Nakhichevan _ an Azerbaijani territory bounded
by Armenia, Iran and Turkey _ and along a tense battlefront on the
Armenia-Azerbaijan border, Soviet media reported. Warring
nationalists began pulling back from the borders last week, the
reports said.
   Both parties agreed before the peace talks not to raise the
issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, the mostly Armenian district located
inside Azerbaijan. Armenia wants to control the enclave; Azerbaijan
refuses to surrender it.
   But the issue dominated the first session of the talks, which
had been expected to focus on the presence of Soviet troops in the
two republics, refugees and humanitarian issues.
   Despite efforts of the Baltic mediators to bring the
Azerbaijanis and Armenians closer together on territorial issues,
the two sides failed to reach any agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The Armenians said that they wanted representatives of the
Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in Nagorno-Karabakh to join
the talks. The Azerbaijanis have refused to negotiate with
Armenians from the region.
   ``It was not easy,'' Latvian Popular Front leader Dainis Ivans,
one of the mediators, told a news conference after the first
session of talks. ``Sometimes we felt we were in the mountains.''
   Baltic mediators are concerned about the precedent set by
military intervention in the southern republics and fear more
violence in the Caucuses could threaten their own peaceful march
toward independence and democracy.
   In a joint communique issued after the first round of talks, the
Azerbaijanis and the Armenians agreed to exert all possible effort
to settle the conflict in the Caucuses in a peaceful manner.
   The Azerbaijanis and the Armenians agreed to use their authority
and influence to secure the release of hostages held by each side
by March 1 and agreed to establish permanent relations between the
Azerbaijani Popular Front and the Armenian National Movement.
   By Feb. 15, they agreed to try to determine the number of
hostages held by each side.
   Both sides also agreed that the communique would be submitted
for consideration to the leadership of their respective movements
and would take effect only if approved by those bodies.
   Life remains difficult in both republics as a result of the
conflict.
   Azerbaijani Communist Party Chief Ayaz Mutalibov appealed to the
population to put the tragedy behind and return to work in a speech
to collective workers in Baku on Saturday, the Tass news agency
reported.
   ``No matter how deeply we grieve over what has happened, we
should work increasingly actively to return life into its normal
channel and get involved in work,'' Mutalibov said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said that 152 of 255
factories in Baku were working on Friday.
   Police and army authorities continued confiscating weapons from
the population, especially since six children were seriously
wounded when a bottle with a flammable mixture they had found
exploded, Tass said.
   Two men were sentenced to nine and 10 years in a labor camp for
resisting arrest when police found them in possession of firearms
and explosives.
   Strikes continued in other major cities in Azerbaijan, the
agency reported.

<HEAD>Rushdie's Year in Hiding Damaging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Salman Rushdie said nearly a year in
hiding has been lonely, with his only company ``people with guns''
_ his protectors.
   Rushdie went into hiding last Feb. 14 after the late Ayatolluh
Khomeini of Iran condemned him to death for his book, ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslems believe blasphemes Islam.
   In a telephone interview with Newsweek magazine, he said he
originally didn't expect his seclusion to last more than a couple
of weeks.
   ``It was only gradually that I began to feel that the damage
that had been done was so huge that it was going to take an awful
lot of undoing,'' Rushdie said. ``I think one of the problems of
unleashing this quantity of hatred is that it's very difficult to
put it back in the box.''
   The interview is to appear in Newsweek's Feb. 12 issue,
available on newsstands Monday.
   Rushdie, living under the protection of Scotland Yard, said he
fled with just the clothes on his back, though he has since
received books and personal belongings.
   After initial weeks glued to a television set, Rushdie returned
to writing book reviews but says that for three months he wrote
little else except for some poems and a journal. He then began
writing a previously planned fable for children.
   Rushdie said he's lucky to be accustomed to spending long
periods alone. His days are spent mostly working. He said he misses
things like grocery shopping and going to movies.
   ``I find myself watching a lot of bad television and videos,''
he said. ``And that's about it, except that instead of being
entirely by myself, I've got a number of guests around. People with
guns.''
   He's learned to ``become chatty on the telephone,'' noting that
he can choose whom he calls _ though the chosen often need to be
convinced it's really him.
   Rushdie said his wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, who
left their hiding place to return to public life in July, ``has
actually taken more of the weight of this than any other human
being, and in many ways still is.''
   Rushdie said he feels a paperback edition of ``The Satanic
Verses'' should be issued. ``I see this as an innocent book,
wrongly accused and much persecuted,'' he said.
   He also said he has no intention of trying to change his
identity.
   ``I simply will not accept that this is going to be the rest of
my life _ I have to remain an optimist in the sense of believing
that solutions are possible.''

<TEXT>
   Jazz drummer and orchestra leader Mel Lewis has
died of cancer at age 60.
   Lewis, who died of melanoma Friday at a hospice, in 1965 with
trumpeter Thad Jones formed the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Big Band,
which played for 23 years.
   Lewis, whose real name was Melvin Sokoloff, started his career
working with dance bands in his hometown of Buffalo when he was 14.
   By 1948, he had played with some well-known jazz bands including
the Boyd Raeburn Orchestra and the bands of Alvino Ray, Tex Beneke
and Ray Anthony.
   Lewis joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra in 1954. In 1957 he moved
to Los Angeles and worked with big band leaders Terry Gibbs and
Gerald Wilson, along with pianist Hampton Hawes.
   Lewis, who played until three weeks before his death, said he
loved any kind of music.
   ``When I play, I'm ecstatic. There isn't a better feeling in the
world than swinging or playing a good arrangement,'' he told an
interviewer last year.
   Lewis is survived by his wife, Doris Sokoloff; two daughters,
three sisters, a brother and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A bouncer shot an off-duty police officer
outside a bar early Saturday when a graduation party for eight
rookie officers ended in a street fight, a police official said.
   Officer John Hanley, 21, was in serious but stable condition
after surgery at Bellevue Hospital, said Chief of Detectives Joseph
Borrelli.
   Hanley was shot in the stomach and the arm; another man involved
in the fight was shot once in the hand.
   The cause of the fight was apparently a woman who left the bar
in a limousine, Borrelli said.
   The brawl began outside the Manhattan bar around 4:20 a.m., with
as many as 10 people involved, Borrelli said.
   Two officers were punched in the face, including one who was
knocked unconscious, before Hanley moved in and arrested Mark
Tarazhi, 21.
   Hanley, his gun on Tarazhi, tried to take the man into the bar.
But bouncer Eugene DiSilvio, an ex-police officer, pulled a handgun
and ordered Hanley to drop his weapon. When Hanley refused and kept
walking, DiSilvio fired two shots at the officer, Borrelli said.
   DiSilvio, who was not charged in the shooting, told police that
Hanley never identified himself as an officer, and Borrelli said
Hanley's police ID was still in his pocket.
   Tarazhi fled after the shooting, but was arrested when he
arrived at New York University Medical Center for treatment of a
gunshot wound to his hand, Borrelli said. Tarazhi was charged with
assault.
   Three of the eight officers at the bar were not involved in the
fight, the chief of detectives said.

   Hurricane Ofa, packing winds up
to 104 mph, knocked out electrical power and caused minor flooding
and damage Saturday as it passed 230 miles to the west of this U.S.
territory, authorities said.
   There were no reports of injuries, according to Territorial
Emergency Management Committee coordinator Maiava Hunkin.
   Disrupted communications Friday and Saturday caused a blackout
of information from Western Samoa, which is about 40 miles west of
here.
   At 7 p.m. EST, Ofa was at 14.6 degrees south latitude and 173.5
degrees west longitude and moving to the south-southeast at 8 mph,
the National Weather Service office in Honolulu said, quoting
weather officials in Fiji.
   If the hurricane kept on course, its center would pass to the
west of Western Samoa, a country of about 160,000 people.
   High winds knocked out electrical power to about 90 percent of
Tutuila, American Samoa's main island, where most of the
territory's 38,000 resident live.

<TEXT>
   Teen-agers who claimed they were ``driven
to kill something'' after listening to hours of heavy metal rock
music have been charged in a dog killing, police said.
   Four male teens were arrested Friday night, said police Sgt. Ric
Storbeck.
   He said the oldest, Timothy Todd Bloemers, 18, of Caledonia, was
being held at the Racine County Jail Saturday for lack of $5,000
bail on charges of taking the dog and causing its death.
   Three 17-year-olds who were released to their parents will have
their cases reviewed by juvenile court officials, Storbeck said.
   He said the incident occurred Jan. 5 after three of the youths
listened to various heavy metal groups, then went to a neighborhood
yard and stole the dog, a 1{-year-old German shepherd-and-husky mix.
   ``They said that they were driven to kill something after
listening to the heavy metal music,'' Storbeck said.
   The teens took the animal to a wooded area in this community
about 10 miles south of Milwaukee, beat it and one youth knelt on
the animal's neck, he said.
   The three left the animal for dead, later told a friend about
the killing, then returned to find the dog still alive, Storbeck
said. The officer said they then beat it until it died.
   Police Investigator Tom Simons said the dog's owner reported the
dog missing. Police received information from informers and
questioned those believed to have been involved, he said.

<HEAD>Signs of Corrosion in Trans-Alaska Pipeline Worries Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massive corrosion has weakened the 800-mile
Trans-Alaska pipeline, prompting federal officials to investigate
possible safety violations by the pipeline's operators, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry consortium that
operates the pipeline, has begun making repairs to the crude-oil
pipeline, the Times reported in Sunday's editions.
   If left unchecked, corrosion could eventually weaken the
half-inch-thick steel wall of the pipe, which is pressurized and
could rupture, conceivably spawning an oil spill requiring a costly
pipeline shutdown.
   But Alyeska officials maintain that the corrosion poses no
immediate danger to its operations or to the environment. The
pipeline carries crude oil from Alaska's North Slope to Valdez,
where the crude is transferred to tankers for shipment to
refineries.
   ``We have sufficient early warning in this case,'' said Bill
Howitt, Alyeska's manager for engineering. ``We don't have pipeline
integrity problems.''
   Officials at the federal Office of Pipeline Safety aren't so
sure.
   ``The extent of it we don't know, but it's big enough that it
could affect the integrity of the pipeline,'' said Jack Overly, the
agency's Western regional division chief.
   Alyeska may have violated federal safety regulations by failing
to adequately maintain portions of its systems designed to retard
corrosion, according to agency staff reports.
   The Office of Pipeline Safety, part of the Department of
Transportation, could decide by spring whether to cite Alyeska for
violating federal guidelines, the newspaper said.
   Pipeline inspection reports show that safeguards against
corrosion often were incomplete or faulty to begin with, the Times
reported.
   Most of the corrosion was caused by the failure of a protective
coating and tape wraps, which many critics earlier had warned were
flawed, the newspaper said.
   Before pipeline operations began in 1977, preparations for
laboratory tests of corrosion were set up at the National Bureau of
Standards. But those tests were never conducted, the Times said.
   Alyeska has said that repairs on weakened portions of the line
can be completed without disrupting oil flow for more than 2{ days
over the next 18 months. Until repairs can be completed, pressure
in the line has been reduced by 20 percent in key locations.
   The pipeline rehabilitation plan could cost operators $1.5
billion over the next five years, and under a complex formula used
to determine royalties paid to Alaska, the state could lose $22
million this year alone, said Alaska Attorney General Douglas B.
Baily.

   Two small planes collided Saturday while
trying to land at the municipal airport Saturday, killing one pilot
and critically injuring the other, authorities said.
   Both pilots were alone when their planes collided about 300 to
400 feet in the air just before 11 a.m.
   No injuries were reported on the ground, but one plane nearly
missed a house, said Lou Rosskamp, a spokeswoman for the Indian
River County sheriff's office.
   Authorities said the dead man was a licensed pilot and a student
at the Florida Institute of Technology's School of Aeronautics, but
declined to release his name before notifying his family.
   Roger Cooper, 62, of Sebastian, a coastal town about 70 miles
north of West Palm Beach, was in critical condition in the
intensive care unit at Humana Hospital with multiple injuries to
his face, arms and legs, said a nursing supervisor.
   Witnesses told investigator Carrol Smith that Cooper's Grumman
Cheetah struck the student's Piper Warrior II from behind as the
Piper made its final approach to the airstrip about a mile away,
according to National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jorge
Prellezo in Miami.
   ``We're not faulting anybody at this time,'' Prellezo said.
``It's possible the one that struck the Piper never saw the
traffic. ... We're looking at the angles and everything else.''
   The student's plane crashed nose-first into the backyard of a
house, about 20 feet from a swimming pool, said Annabelle Stevens,
the home's owner.
   ``Thank the Lord it didn't hit the house,'' Mrs. Stevens said as
rescue workers foamed down the area to prevent a fire. ``Five more
minutes and I would have been outside hanging clothes.''
   Cooper, a retired Air Force colonel and a former member of the
airport's advisory board, was thrown from his plane when it crashed
across the street.
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration in Miami
also headed to the scene Saturday, said FAA spokesman Roger Myers
in Atlanta.
   Myers said the planes were not being guided by air traffic
controllers at the time of the crash. The airport has no control
tower.
   ``Apparently both of these aircraft were operating under visual
flight rules, which means see and be seen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radical Faction: Soviets Won't Direct Flights Of Jewish Emigrants
To Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a PLO faction on Saturday said
a ranking Soviet official has assured the Palestine Liberation
Organization that Jews leaving the Soviet Union will no longer be
flown directly to Israel.
   ``The Soviets assured us they would stop all direct flights
between Moscow and Tel Aviv,'' said Nayef Hawatmeh,
secretary-general of the Marxist-oriented Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, after PLO discussions with Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Gennady Tarassov.
   Hawatmeh, who spoke to reporters after a three-day meeting of
the PLO's Executive Committee at its headquarters in Tunis, said
direct flights are ``a method that leaves no other choice of
destination for Soviet Jewish emigration candidates.''
   A stop in Vienna, Austria, he said by way of example, would
allow immigrants a freedom of choice to pick other countries in
which to settle.
   There was no immediate confirmation from Tarassov, who met in
recent days with PLO officials in the Tunisian capital.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indicated last month that
Israel needed to keep the occupied lands to settle an expected wave
of immigrants, which Israel says may total 300,000 in the next
three years. Moscow broke diplomatic ties with Israel over its
occupation of Arab territory in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In late January the head of a Soviet diplomatic delegation
visiting Israel, Georgi Martirosov, blamed Shamir for the delay in
approving an agreement between Aeroflot and Israel's El Al airlines
for regularly scheduled direct flights between the nations,
including transport of immigrants.
   Israel in October announced a preliminary agreement; some such
flights have occurred since then but were not regularly scheduled
and only one carried immigrants.
   Last Thursday, Azzam al-Ahmed, the Palestinian ambassador to
Iraq, said the PLO will send a delegation to Moscow soon to ask
that Jewish emigration to Israeli-occupied territories be
restricted.
   The 22-nation Arab League expressed concern at a meeting Friday
that Soviet-Jewish immigration to Israel will spill over to augment
the ``illegal'' settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Hawatmeh also said the PLO will not use guns in its strategy in
the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli authority in the occupied
lands. He said protesters will continue to use rocks and firebombs.
   The organization ``remains committed to its engagement not to
use firearms in the occupied Gaza Strip or the West Bank,''
Hawatmeh said.
   ``Our arm is the intefadeh (uprising) of the Palestinian people
who are following it in a peaceful way, throwing stones and Molotov
cocktails,'' he said.
   Hawatmeh said the Executive Committee had decided to call a
meeting of the Central Council soon to examine the development of
the Mideast situation since the last Central Council meeting in
October in Baghdad, Iraq. He did not disclose a date or a site for
the meeting.
   The 150-member Central Council is the representative body
between the Executive Committee and the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile.

<TEXT>
   East coast radio and television newswriters will
get two 5 percent pay increases under a three-year contract
tentatively agreed to Friday by the Writers Guild of America, East
and Capital Cities-ABC.
   ``We are very pleased with this contract,'' said Jeffrey
Ruthizer, Cap Cities vice president for labor relations. ``The
union was sensitive to the company's need for increased flexibility
and we were able to respond to its concerns with wage increases and
protections important to them.''
   The union's 160 writers, editors, desk assistants, researchers,
production assistants, promotion writers and graphic artists are
employed at ABC's local and network stations in Washington and New
York.
   The old three-year contract expired at midnight. Negotiators
worked through the night and the union accepted Capital Cities'
final proposal about 7 a.m..
   ``We believe that the agreement provides for a fair and
equitable contract for our members,'' said Mona Mangan, chief
negotiator for the guild.
   In 1987, the guild was involved in a bitter seven-week strike.
   The first 5 percent increase is immediate and the second comes
in 18 months. Union spokesman Martin Waldman said the increases
would hike the average newswriters' salary from $863 to $949.
   Waldman said the guild also kept intact some union-covered
duties ABC tried to eliminate at ``Good Morning America'' and
``News One,'' Capital Cities' television news service for
affiliates.
   The proposal also includes new fees for radio newswriters at the
network level who take on additional technical jobs and more
vacation time for employees with more than 15 years experience.
   Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for Cap Cities-ABC, said the
flexibility Ruthizer spoke of in the new contract ``allows
management and others outside the bargaining unit to perform duties
previously performed by people in the bargaining unit.''
   Those jobs include writing, said Hoover.
   Union members vote on the proposed pact on Monday.
   On Tuesday, the guild is to begin negotiations for its members
at CBS television and radio. Their contract, which covers employees
at the network and local levels, expires March 1.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American funds bought made-in-India ``general
purpose utility vehicles'' for the opposition political party in
Nicaragua, according to statements Friday by angry lawmakers from
auto industry districts.
   ``The workers of our country whose taxes finance this assistance
surely deserve more consideration,'' said Reps. Marcy Kaptur,
D-Ohio, and Jim Jontz, D-Ind., in a letter of protest to the
organizations that handled part of the money appropriated for
helping Nicaragua hold fair elections.
   Kaptur represents Toledo, where Chrysler Corp. makes Jeeps, and
Jontz represents Kokomo, Ind., where Chrysler makes transmissions.
   The entire aid package was $9 million. Of that, $1.8 million
went to the United Nicaraguan Opposition opposing Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega. About $743,000 was spent on cars, trucks
and four-wheel-drive vehicles, said Ken Wollack, executive vice
president of the National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs.
   A total of 93 vehicles was purchased, including 50 Indian-made
utility vehicles.
   Wollack said his organization, which is affiliated with the
Democratic Party, would have preferred to buy American-made Jeeps
for Nicaragua's opposition, but with the election scheduled for
Feb. 25 and grant agreements uncertain until last December, there
was no time to move U.S.-exported vehicles through all the required
clearances.
   The vehicles purchased were already in Nicaragua, waiting to
clear customs, Wollack said.
   ``Because of the (U.S. trade) embargo there were no American
vehicles to be bought in Nicaragua,'' he said. ``The only way to
purchase the equipment and get it to Nicaragua in time ... was to
buy equipment already in Nicaragua.''
   Further complicating the politics of the utility vehicle
purchase, the U.S. trade representative has cited India for unfair
trading practices.
   Jontz said India requires 98 percent local content for autos to
qualify as Indian-made. Imported cars bear a 140 percent tariff and
imported trucks are taxed at 190 percent.
   ``It is ironic under these circumstances that American tax
dollars are being used to purchase vehicles from India,'' said the
protest letter.
   The lawmakers, both of whom voted against the $9 million
Nicaraguan aid package, wrote, ``Regardless of how one feels about
the aid to begin with, certainly this particular use of funds ...
is most objectionable.''

   More than 1,000 Southeast Asians marched in a
downtown park Friday to protest government attacks on villages
opposed to communist domination in Laos and pressure the United
States to intervene.
   Bundled in heavy coats and scarves, Hmong originally from the
northern foothills of Laos walked through 3 inches of fresh snow at
Ziedler Park chanting ``U.S., we need your help. Laos needs
democracy.''
   They said many Hmong in Laos have been killed by bombs and
chemical weapons in assaults launched recently by communist forces
in Vietnam and Laos.
   ``Their animals have been killed. Their food has been destroyed.
They are without shelter. They have no shovels to bury those that
are killed and no medicine to treat those that are wounded,''
demonstrator Nao Shoua Xiong said.
   He said Hmong are the target of a brutal offensive which began
after Free Lao, a resistance movement, declared a provisional
government Dec. 5. Free Lao is dedicated to freeing Laos from
Vietnamese domination and establishing a democracy in the country,
Xiong said.
   Xiong, 42, like many Hmong, was recruited to help the U.S.
military during the Vietnam war. He served as an interpreter, then
fled the country 15 years ago, first on foot through Thailand.
   ``The Vietnamese don't like us. They want to exterminate all the
people who fought against them in Vietnam. The Lao government does
what the Vietnamese government tells them. The Vietnamese should
withdraw from Laos completely and let the Laotians determine their
future,'' he said.
   More than 16,000 Hmong who fled Laos to escape communist
persecution now reside in Wisconsin, officials said. An additional
14,000 live in neighboring Minnesota and 50,000 in California.
   Less than a quarter of Laos' 3.8 million people are Hmong.
   Xiong said hundreds of Hmong villagers have been killed and many
hundreds more poisoned and maimed in the northern and central
provinces of Laos.
   The protesters called for international condemnation of the
attacks and urged the United States to withhold funds from the
Laotian government designated for anti-drug work and searches for
U.S. soldiers missing in action.
   ``If the U.S. government doesn't support us, we have no where
else to turn,'' said 18-year-old Chee Vang Moua, from Milwaukee.
   ``We have heard that a lot of people have died. I don't think
they should send the drug money until this is resolved,'' said Mai
Yong Vang, 22, a Milwaukee nurse.
   The demonstration was one of several planned for Friday and
Saturday in many U.S. cities, including one outside the Laotian
Embassy in Washington.
   According to a report issued Wednesday by the Republican Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, fighting in Laos
during January was aimed at destroying the civilian population in
the mountainous northern region.
   The report said the bombings by the Vietnamese were endorsed by
the Laotian government and that the results of some attacks pointed
to the use of chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed budget could gut
efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico
border, contrary to adminstration promises to step up law
enforcement on the front lines, area Democrats contended Friday.
   The Southwest border's four Democratic senators said Bush's
budget seeks personnel reductions in three federal law enforcement
agencies that could seriously affect their operations along the
border.
   Bush released his budget Monday, four days after declaring the
Southwest border, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City
were ``high intensity drug trafficking areas'' eligible for
hundreds of additional law enforcement agents and millions of
dollars in additional federal aid.
   But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the benefit of being
targeted for more help has been undercut by the president's budget,
which seeks reductions for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
   According to Bentsen and fellow Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a total of
636 positions would be cut from Customs, 423 from the INS, and 185
from the ATF, the lead agency on the border for gang enforcement
and firearms investigations.
   The senators, in a letter Friday to William J. Bennett, director
of the office of national drug control policy, ask his help in
restoring these law enforcement positions to federal agencies
``which are this nation's front line forces in the war on drugs.
   ``We believe cuts of this magnitude will have a serious adverse
impact on each of these agencies' operations in the Southwest,''
the senators said.
   The president's new drug control strategy, however, recommends
an additional 174 Border Patrol agents and 175 Customs inspectors
for the Southwest border, which the adminstration described as the
principal corridor for moving drugs, especially marijuana, cocaine
and heroin, into the country.

   The Jan. 1 inventory of cattle and calves on
the nation's farms and ranches edged up from a year ago to 99.3
million, but was still below the 99.6 million of 1988, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   ``This reversed the recent downward trend in cattle inventories
and shows the first Jan. 1 yearly increase since 1982,'' said the
National Agricultural Statistics Service.
   The 1989 inventory was 99.2 million head, a 28-year low.
   Officials said the 1990 calf crop is expected to be 43.9 million
head, up fractionally from 43.7 million last year and up 1 percent
from 1988.
   ``This was the second consecutive increase in all cows and
heifers that have calved following six consecutive years of
decline,'' the statistics service said.
   The breakdown:
   _Beef cows, 33.7 million, up 1 percent from Jan. 1, 1989 and 2
percent above Jan. 1, 1988.
   _Milk cows, 10.1 million, down 1 percent from last year and 2
percent below two years ago.
   _All heifers, 500 pounds and over, 17.9 million, up 3 percent
from last year and up 4 percent from two years ago.
   _Beef replacement heifers, 5.47 million, down slightly from last
year but up 4 percent from two years ago.
   _Milk replacement heifers, 4.29 million, up 2 percent from last
year and up 4 percent from two years ago.
   _Other heifers, 8.09 million, up 5 percent from a year ago and
up 3 percent from two years ago.
   _Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 16.1 million, up 2 percent
from both of the last two years.
   _Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.21 million, down
fractionally from last year but up 2 percent from two years ago.
   _Calves under 500 pounds, 19.3 million, down fractionally 4
percent from last year and down 8 percent from two years ago.
   _ All cattle and calves on feed for slaughter, 11.6 million, up
2 percent from last year, but down 2 percent from two years ago.

Panelists Say</HEAD>

   A new device designed to detect plastic
explosives in airplane luggage is deficient and probably could not
have discovered the bomb which destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, members of a presidential terrorism commission
said Friday.
   Panelists at a hearing of the Presidential Commission on
Terrorism Aviation Security and Terrorism sharply questioned plans
by the Federal Aviation Administration to require the airline
industry to buy hundreds of the bomb detecting devices, complaining
that they have not been adequately tested.
   But Monte Belger, the FAA's associate administrator for aviation
standards, said he believes the sophisticated detection device is
the best of its kind in the world, has been adequately tested and
should be deployed.
   In a three-hour hearing, the commission also was told that the
device _ which employs a technique called thermal neutron analysis,
or TNA _ will cost far more than original estimates of between
$700,000 to $1 million each.
   Belger said the first five TNA machines actually will cost a
total $15 million or about $2.5 million each because of the rush
nature of the order.
   A TNA system _ an 18-foot high, 20,000-ton machine _ is at work
inspecting baggage at Kennedy International Airport in New York. A
second system was installed at Miami International Airport last
week and is being calibrated. A third TNA machine is to be
installed at Gatwick Airport near London next month, and site
planning is under way to place one at Washington Dulles
International Airport.
   ``I think there is a lot of flim flam going on,'' said Sen.
Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a commission member. ``The TNA looks good
but it does not do what it is supposed to do. Congress has been
sold a bill of goods. ...
   ``There is a reduced ability to detect plastic explosives at the
levels believed to have been used at Lockerbie,'' the senator said.
   Investigators believe the Lockerbie crash on Dec. 21, 1988, was
caused by less than a pound of plastic explosives secreted inside a
portable tape player. The crash killed 259 people aboard the Boeing
747 aircraft and 11 people on the ground.
   Science magazine, which first reported in August that the TNA
machines would not be able to detect a Lockerbie-sized bomb, said
the devices are being set at a sensitivity that will detect about
2.5 pounds of explosives.
   The TNA machines use neutrons _ a type of subatomic particle _
to probe luggage for the presence of nitrogen, a major component of
explosives. A problem with the TNA system is that some types of
fabric, leather and such things as plastic ski boots can have
nitrogen densities as high as explosives.
   Hadi Bozorgmanesh, vice president of Science Applications
International Corp., also defended the device his company developed
and said it has established a high success rate of detecting all
sizes and designs of bombs. He said an accusation that the TNA
machine cannot detect a bomb as small as two pounds is ``absolutely
false.''
   ``We would like to get closer to 100 percent and to detect
smaller amounts of explosives with better accuracy,'' he said and
added: ``I totally agree that the system is not perfect, but it's
far better than anything else that can be demonstrated.''
   He said the company is working to make the device ``smaller,
faster, cheaper and more accurate.''
   D'Amato said calibrating the TNA device to detect a
Lockerbie-sized bomb would set off so many false alarms ``that you
would have a system which is inoperative.''
   Belger said: ``I am convinced the TNA machine has been tested
sufficiently for the U.S. government to want to deploy it. It is
not perfect and we know it.''
   A vigorous drive is under way to identify and develop other
technologies which will more efficiently detect bombs in luggage,
and breakthroughs are expected soon, Belger said.
   In the meantime, he said the safety of the traveling public
demands that the TNA machines be widely deployed.
   Commission member Thomas C. Richards, a retired Air Force
general, told Belger: ``It is your responsibility to prove the
technology before you go to industry and tell them to buy a pig in
a poke.''
   Belger replied: ``It would be a mistake not to continue to
deploy it. It is wrong to wait for the perfect machine.''
   Representatives of airport operators also expressed objections
to the TNA device.
   Siegbert B. Poritsky, vice president of the Airport Operators
Council International said the FAA's requirement that explosive
detection systems be installed at major airports is causing `'more
confusion than security.''
   ``As a result the only approved equipment to date, TNA, is too
slow and large to accommodate in a manner which will do the most
good, too heavy for most airport terminal floors, and has a
substantial false alarm rate which causes long delays in baggage
screening and causes personnel to be complacent in responding to
alarms,'' he said.

   Flames shooting from an engine forced a
Northwest Airlines DC-10 to return to Los Angeles Airport early
Friday, but the 99 passengers and nine-member crew were uninjured.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said the flames in the left
engine were caused by a compressor stall, a problem that can occur
when the even flow of air to the engine turbine blades is
interrupted, causing too much jet fuel to accumulate.
   A DC-10 has three engines, but can safely land on two, said Rich
Tornquist, Federal Aviation Administration regional duty officer.
   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said Flight 84 arrived in Los
Angeles from Honolulu. Mechanics examined the engine and repaired
the problem, he said.
   The Minneapolis-bound passengers went to a nearby hotel to rest
after the landing at 2:20 a.m. and then boarded a later flight,
Gibbons said.

   An American Airlines 727-200 jet with 63 people
aboard landed safely Friday at O'Hare International Airport after
reporting hydraulic problems, officials said. No injuries were
reported.
   The pilot of Flight 1125, en route to Chicago from Omaha, Neb.,
reported the plane had problems with its main hydraulic system,
which controls steering, said Tom Stack, a spokesman for American
Airlines. The pilot switched to a back-up system, he said.
   The plane was carrying 56 passengers and seven crew members.
   The pilot considered landing in Minneapolis because of the
threat of bad weather at O'Hare, but decided to to try the Chicago
landing, Stack said.
   The plane landed safely at O'Hare at 5:10 p.m. CST as emergency
crews stood by, said Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Chicago.
   The plane was then towed to the terminal where the passengers
disembarked without incident, Edelstein said.

<HEAD>Hungarians Report Progress After First Round Of Withdrawal Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary said the Soviet Union agreed to
continue work on a timetable for removing all 50,000 Soviet troops
from the country during an initial two-day session that ended
Friday.
   ``In the course of the talks, the sides set forth their position
and agreed that the withdrawal of Soviet troops will be carried out
on the basis of an inter-governmental agreement to be concluded
within the shortest possible time,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
communique.
   The communique, carried by the official MTI news agency, said no
date was set for a second round of talks, but that two sides had
agreed to continue efforts ``at working out the timetable for the
pullout.''
   There was no immediate Soviet comment.
   The talks were the second of their kind in Eastern Europe since
a wave of democratization last year started loosening the Soviet
grip over its Warsaw Pact allies.
   The first, held in Prague on withdrawing troops from
Czechoslovakia, ended inconclusively early this month. A second
round is set for next week.
   The head of the Hungarian delegation and secretary of state in
the Foreign Ministry, Ferenc Somogyi, said Thursday night that his
country is seeking a withdrawal by the end of the year or early
1991.
   The Hungarian communique said the talks with the Soviet
delegation, led by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Aboimov,
were held in an ``objective, constructive atmosphere.''
   The estimated 50,000 Soviet troops in Hungary and 70,000 in
Czechoslovakia are stationed on the basis of ``temporary''
agreements the Kremlin reached with the two countries after
quashing a revolt against Stalinism in 1956 in Hungary and reforms
in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   The new leaderships of the East bloc have echoed calls for troop
withdrawals. In Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa made the
appeal to the Soviet ambassador, although the non-communist-led
government has not started negotiations.
   Moscow began reducing its troop presence in Hungary last April
as part of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
cutting 50,000 soldiers from the Red Army in Eastern Europe.

   The spiritual leader of Anglicans
worldwide arrived Friday on his first visit to this predominantly
Moslem country to promote understanding and goodwill.
   The Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie bowed low to receive
almost a dozen traditional heart-shaped garlands during a
red-carpet welcoming ceremony at Islamabad International Airport.
   ``It's the first time I've nearly been strangled by kindness,''
Runcie said during a brief arrival address to representatives of
Pakistan's minority Christian community.
   Runcie's host, the Church of Pakistan headed by Bishop Alexander
Malik, is an interdenominational church representing 700,000
Anglicans, Lutherans, Presbyterians and Methodists.
   There are about 3 million Christians among Pakistan 107 million
people.
   Runcie said he wanted his visit to emphasize the need for
dialogue between varying religions.
   ``We should be talking to each other, building bonds of
friendship together, working together for human betterment,'' he
said.
   Runcie is to meet Saturday with Pakistan President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan.
   The archbishop will also spend a day in Pakistan's rugged
Northwest Frontier Province bordering war-weary Afghanistan. He
will later tour the ancient Punjab capital of Lahore and the
ethnically troubled port of Karachi.
   Runcie visits Bangladesh after Pakistan.

   Hundreds of banana farmers marched on
this Caribbean capital Friday to protest declining banana prices
and the government's recent takeover of their association.
   There were no arrests in the demonstration led by banana farmer
Rupert Gajadhar and opposition Labor Party leader Julian Hunte, but
there were several scuffles with armed police when protesters broke
through a police cordon.
   Prime Minister John Compton fired the board of directors of the
Banana Growers Association in October and accused Gajadhar, the
ex-chairman, of engaging in ``confrontation politics.'' A
government-appointed interim board assumed control.
   ``We are protesting against the withdrawal of our democratic
right to elect our own people to represent us and run our
business,'' Gajadhar told reporters. ``We are protesting against
the low prices that we have got (for bananas) for years.''
   Banana exports, mostly to Britain, are the main earner of hard
currency for this island-nation of 140,000 people.

   Authorities on Friday began checking
whether the state's suspended revenue director altered or destroyed
any documents related to an investigation against her.
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement inspectors interviewed
Department of Revenue employees Friday about a scrap of paper found
on the desk of director Katie Tucker and visits she made to her
office, two at night.
   The night visits prompted Brian Ballard, director of operations
for Gov. Bob Martinez, to have the locks changed on department
doors Thursday.
   ``From now on, whenever she goes over there she's going to have
an escort,'' Ballard said. Either officials from a Cabinet agency
or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will accompany her.
   Inspectors confiscated 10 to 20 documents and a typewriter from
Tucker's office, said Jere Moore, spokesman for the Department of
Revenue.
   ``They took the files they thought were appropriate for their
inquiry,'' Moore said.
   The latest investigation came after Sam Alexander, the assistant
director of the department, was shown a scrap of paper bearing his
initials that had apparently been cut up. Alexander said Friday
that another employee found the scrap on Ms. Tucker's desk and
brought it to him.
   Ms. Tucker is serving a 10-day suspension with pay ordered by
Martinez and the Cabinet because of a 1988 tax investigation of
Tallahassee businesman Donald G. Resha, a political rival of Ms.
Tucker's husband.
   Martinez has called for her resignation from the appointed
position.
   There was no answer at Ms. Tucker's home on Friday, but when
contacted by the St. Petersburg Times on Thursday, she said, ``This
is crazy.''
   It is a third-degree felony to alter public documents under
Florida law.
   Ms. Tucker has visited the office several times to look through
documents to back up her contention that the tax probe was part of
a sweep of video stores like those owned by Resha, said Moore, the
Revenue Department spokesman.
   Resha unsuccessully ran against her husband, Daniel Miller, for
state AFL-CIO presidency in 1985.
   Alexander took the paper to Cabinet officials Thursday. He said
he was concerned the paper could be used to superimpose his name on
possibly forged documents using a copy machine.
   ``That's one of the things the FDLE is looking into, whether
there were documents destroyed or altered,'' said Alexander, who
was interviewed by investigators Thursday.
   He said Ms. Tucker told aides Thursday she had found a document
expressing her concern that the probe was centered on Resha. Such a
document would back her claims that she never intended Resha to be
the sole target.
   Previous FDLE reports have found nothing to indicate such a
sweep was conducted, saying Resha alone was targeted for the tax
investigation on Ms. Tucker's orders.
   She has said she will decide by Monday whether to step down or
face the governor and Cabinet at its meeting Tuesday.
   She also faces a $4 million defamation lawsuit filed Thursday by
Resha in Leon Circuit Court.

<HEAD>Shamir Demands Vote of Confidence from Likud Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he
will demand a vote of confidence from his right-wing Likud bloc
because of a barrage of criticism by hawkish party rivals who
oppose his peace moves.
   The Likud power struggle, which has halted Middle East peace
efforts, has increased in intensity daily, with Shamir and his
allies trading barbs and trying to outmaneuver each other before
next week's Central Committee party meeting.
   ``For too long I have been insulted by slanderous and attacking
voices from within my own movement,'' Shamir said on Israel
television. ``This is not a normal phenomenon.''
   ``Because of this, I believe that the central committee must
adopt a decision on confidence in the prime minister and the head
of the movement.''
   The showdown will take place next week when Shamir hopes to get
a single vote of confidence from the 3,200 committee members for
his leadership and for his plan calling for elections in the
occupied territories as a first step toward peace.
   The party rebels, led by Central Committee Chairman and Trade
Minister Ariel Sharon, demand that Likud members instead vote on
separate motions on the plan's details, such as barring
Palestinians from Arab east Jerusalem from voting in the elections.
   Shamir aides said they fear Sharon's voting procedure would
place unnecessary constraints on Shamir in his peace negotiations
with the United States and Egypt that are expected to lead to the
elections.
   ``Shamir wants a vote of confidence. He wants to prove that the
majority stands behind him and wants to be able to maneuver freely
in the diplomatic arena,'' said the Likud official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Shamir has threatened to resign if he does not win the support
of the Central Committee.
   ``If the central committee does not accept my ways and does not
accept my recommendations and does not give me its full faith, I
will have to draw conclusions,'' Shamir said.
   Sharon aides could not be reached for comment Friday, but the
trade minister and his allies have daily heaped insults on the
prime minister. He has been called ``a rotten apple,'' ``a complete
failure'' and ``a con-man.''
   In one instance, Sharon accused Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a
Shamir ally, of avoiding battle during Israel's 1948 War of
Independence. Arens denied the allegations.
   When asked to respond to Sharon's insults in Friday's television
interview Shamir said: ``He talks too much.''
   The inner-party battle has been waged for two weeks, halting any
movement in the peace process because Washington has become
convinced there is no point in pushing ahead until Shamir has
re-established his leadership.
   The confrontation further escalated Thursday when Shamir sent
out invitations for the Feb. 7 Central Committee meeting that
contradict the agenda previously set by Sharon.
   Shamir's agenda calls for a speech outlining the peace plan and
a yes-or-no vote, while Sharon wants votes on separate motions.
   Shamir and his aides accused Sharon of using the platform of the
Central Committee meeting to wage a struggle for succession to the
party leadership.
   ``There are people who because of personal problems are driving
the whole country crazy, and are blocking all achievements. We have
to stop this,'' Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying.
   In fact, there are few ideological difference between the
hard-line Shamir and his rivals, who include Housing Minister David
Levy and Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai.
   For example, all are opposed to the participation of east
Jerusalem Arabs and Palestinian deportees in a Palestinian
delegation that would hold preliminary peace talks with Israel in
Cairo.
   The two proposals are part of a compromise package that has been
accepted by the PLO, Egypt, the United States and Israel's
left-of-center Labor Party that governs in coalition with Likud.

<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker's doctor and lawyer both
contended Friday that criminal interrogation of the ousted East
German Communist leader was endangering his life.
   The once-powerful 77-year-old Honecker was judged this week to
be too ill to withstand imprisonment and was freed from an East
Berlin jail after about 36 hours detention.
   Honecker is to be tried next month on a charge of high treason,
national prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph has announced.
   In a statement carried by the official ADN news agency, attorney
Wolfgang Vogel and Dr. Friedrich Wolff protested the interrogation
of their client.
   Vogel said criminal investigators questioned Honecker Friday
morning in preparation for the trial against him.
   ``This unannounced investigation session and the previous
imprisonment contrary to doctors' advice has led to a worsening of
his health condition, in the view of Dr. Peter Althaus,'' ADN
quoted Vogel and Wolff as saying in their written statement.
   Althaus was the surgeon who operated on Honecker Jan. 8 to
remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   Vogel and Wolff said investigators were aware of the influence
their questioning was having on Honecker.
   ``Dr. Peter Althaus believes that police interrogation at this
time could endanger the patient's life,'' they stated.
   Lutheran Church officials have taken in Honecker and his wife
Margot, as the Honeckers were stripped of their former residences
and are in effect homeless.
   Honecker was released from East Berlin's Charite hospital on
Monday and was immediately arrested.
   He was released Tuesday night after Joseph failed to obtain a
detention warrant. The East Berlin court heeded doctors' advice
that Honecker was in no condition to be imprisoned.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet delegation is seeking to determine if
joining the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization could benefit
the Soviet Union's economic reforms, especially in farming.
   Eight Soviets arrived in Rome on Thursday for meetings with FAO
officials through next week.
   The Rome-based FAO is attractive because it deals ``not just
(with) resolutions ... but with concrete economic activity,''
delegation leader Konstantin P. Ovchinnikov told reporters Friday.
   ``Our goal is to raise the economic sufficiency of our country.''
   Ovchinnikov, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's
department of international economic organizations, said membership
in FAO would mean access to the agency's technical assistance as
well as scientific know-how..
   Ovchinnikov, an economist, said the FAO could profit from Soviet
expertise and the Soviets could benefit from membership in the
agency.
   He said FAO's statistical and other scientific methods could
prove valuable in reforming the Soviet economy. Other benefits
could come in biotechnology, lifestock and botany, he said.
   Ovchinnikov said any actual FAO aid projects in the Soviet Union
would be ``very modest.''
   Moscow is ``not seeking to divert financial resources from
FAO,'' he said.
   As a founder of FAO in 1945, the Soviet Union does not have to
seek formal approval of member status. FAO Director-General Edouard
Saouma has welcomed the prospect of Soviet membership. The Soviet
Union currently has observer status.
   Ovchinnikov said checking into possible FAO membership comes in
the context of Soviet interest in other international bodies, such
as the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and
GATT, the tariffs organization.

   A Swiss company agreed Friday
to buy 60 percent of Genentech Inc., one of this country's leading
biotechnology companies.
   Roche Holding Ltd., a large Swiss pharmaceutical company, said
it had agreed to invest $492 million in Genentech and buy half its
outstanding stock for $36 a share, 65 percent higher than
Thursday's closing stock price.
   Other features of the transaction, which has a total value of
$2.1 billion, would give Roche 60 percent of Genentech's stock. The
Swiss company would have the option to buy the rest of Genentech's
stock, for higher prices, over the next five years.
   The deal was approved by the Genentech board Friday and will be
submitted to the shareholders for approval in April, the companies
said.
   Genentech, founded in the mid-1970s as one of the first
commercial ventures to make use new biological technology, gets
most of its revenue from two products: A genetically engineered
heart drug called Activase and a human growth hormon sold as
Protrofin.
   Analysts suggested Roche was seeking a bigger foothold in the
U.S. market, and that the infusion of cash would enable Genentech
to expand its efforts.
   Jacqueline Siegel, an analyst with the high-technology
consulting company Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco, said Roche
``clearly bought the most aggressive product development company in
the industry.''
   Denise Gilbert, an analyst who follows the company for
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said Genentech likely would
get the money and market influence to begin trying to buy the
rights to develop or market drugs developed by other biotechnology
companies.
   ``Genentech now is in a very good market position and many of
the other biotech companies _ including Roche itself _ which found
they had niches to themselves may find Genentech as a competitor,''
Gilbert said.
   Fritz Gerber, chairman and chief executive officer of Roche,
released a statement saying, ``Roche's $2.1 billion total
investment will be best served if Genentech continues to operate in
the manner that led to its impressive success in such a short
time.''
   The deal would require all the company's common shareholders to
sell half their stock for $36 a share. The remaining shares would
be converted to a new class of redeemable common stock, and Roche
would have the option to buy all that stock until June 1995.
   Two weeks ago, Genentech reported a turnaround in fourth-quarter
earnings, posting a $15 million profit after losing the same amount
in the fourth quarter of 1988. For all of 1989, Genentech posted a
profit of $44 million.
   The company, based in South San Francisco, said fourth-quarter
sales of Activase jumped 63 percent.
   Roche, based in Basle, Switzerland, has worldwide sales of $6.5
billion, and facilities in 52 countries.

<HEAD>Cult Members Describe Shootings in Videotapes</HEAD>

   A family found buried under a barn ate with the
man charged with their murders on the night of the slayings and had
no idea they were to be shot, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Citing videotaped statements two members of a religious splinter
group gave federal authorities, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer said
Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their three daughters were
brought one by one to a nearby barn after dinner April 17 at the
farmhouse of Jeffrey Lundgren, the group's leader.
   According to the statements, each of the Averys was gagged, tied
and fatally shot. Their bodies were covered with lime, stone, and
trash, and buried in a mass grave, the newspaper said.
   Lundgren, a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is charged with five counts of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. Twelve other cult
members also face charges, including conspiracy and aggravated
murder.
   The bodies of Avery, 49; his 42-year-old wife; and their
daughters Trina, 15; Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7, were found on Jan.
3 and 4.
   Shortly after the discovery, Lake County Prosecutor Steven C.
LaTourette said the slayings may have been designed to spiritually
cleanse the group's members before a trip to the wilderness.
   County Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks has issued a gag order in
the case.
   The newspaper said the videotaped statements were shown to
defense lawyers Wednesday.
   Lawyers for the various defendants either declined to comment or
could not be reached for comment. There was no answer Friday at the
office of Lundgren's attorney, R. Paul LaPlante.
   In the taped statements, Lundgren's wife, Alice; Susan Luff;
Tonya J. Patrick and her husband, Dennis S. Patrick, said they
feared for their lives and dared not defy Lundgren, the newspaper
reported.
   They said they lied to family and friends about their lives with
Lundgren, whom they called ``prophet'' and ``father.''
   The four denied participating in the slayings and said learned
about them later.
   The Plain Dealer said group members Ronald B. Luff and Richard
E. Brand described the killings in statements to officers of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in Kansas City, Mo.
   The day after the shootings occurred, FBI agents and local
authorities who had been monitoring the cult went to the Kirtland
farm, 30 miles east of Cleveland, to question the members, who said
they were not being held against their will.
   The cult members left the area on April 18 and lived at a camp
in West Virginia before heading to Missouri and scattering.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and two employees were
convicted Friday on several charges of bilking the government of
$10 million for a battlefield computer system.
   A U.S. District Court jury returned the verdict against GE,
James Badolato and Gerald A. Leo, both former employees of
Management and Technical Services Co., a GE subsidiary.
   GE faces a fine of about $50 million, plus court costs,
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Howard told reporters after the
verdict. If GE had been convicted on all charges, it would have
faced up to $71.9 million in fines.
   The defendants were found innocent on several charges in the
321-count indictment, which was announced in November 1988. The
trial began last Nov. 14.
   GE and Leo were found guilty of four counts of mail fraud while
Badolato was convicted on one count of obstructing justice and one
count of trying to cover up the fraud scheme. Leo also was
convicted of the cover-up.
   GE was convicted of 282 counts of making false claims and
acquitted of 30 others.
   The company and Leo were acquitted on one fraud count and
Badolato was acquitted of all five counts of mail fraud. Leo and
Badolato were acquitted of one count each of racketeering.
   Leo could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison and fined $1
million, while Badolato could be imprisoned 10 years and fined
$500,000.
   The government also has filed a civil lawsuit seeking $23
million in overcharges and damages in the $234 million project from
1983 to 1986.
   GE could be suspended from Pentagon contracts because of the
verdict, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist. That
decision rests with the Secretary of the Army, he said.
   The subsidiary, Management and Technical Services, was suspended
from government contracts after the indictment, Harbist said.
Action on GE was withheld, pending resolution of the case, he said.
   GE receives approximately $6 billion annually for defense
contracts ranging from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment
to highly classified strategic work.
   This was GE's second defense-related fraud case in four years.
   In May 1985, the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming
$800,000 in cost overruns on Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missiles and paid a $1.04 million fine.
   Under the $250 million no-bid contract in the current case, the
King of Prussia-based Management and Technical Services subsidiary
was to provide 233 mobile computer units in five production years
beginning in 1984. The government alleged that GE padded its costs
and failed to notify the Pentagon of savings negotiated with
subcontractors.
   Badolato, 43, of Springfield, and Leo, 52, of King of Prussia,
are now working in other GE departments.
   The company pleaded innocent, although GE acknowledged an
internal investigation uncovered discrepancies totaling $3.69
million, which the company refunded in 1985.

   Walt Disney World has raised the
admission price almost 5 percent for its three theme parks to help
pay for several new attractions, the company announced Friday.
   The new prices take effect Feb. 11. Disney World last raised its
prices at May 1, 1989. Customers will have to pay $100 ($80 per
child) for a four-day pass to all parks and $117 ($95 per child)
for five days. A single-day admission will cost $31 ($25 per child).
   The current price is $29 ($23 per child) for a single day, $97
($77 per child) for a four-day pass and $112 ($90 per child) for
five days.
   Disney, in announcing the price increases, noted recent
additions to their theme parks.
   The company recently opened ``Star Tours'' and the ``Indiana
Jones Stunt Spectacular'' at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park;
``Wonders of Life'' at Epcot Center and ``Dreamflight'' in the
Magic Kingdom.

   Three students were wounded Friday in a
gang shooting outside a high school during lunch break, police said.
   Police arrested one 17-year-old about a half-mile from Austin
High School and a 16-year-old student originally brought for
questioning as a witness, said Lt. Paul Saucedo.
   ``They literally got out of the car walked up the stairs and
found their targets and shot'' with a handgun, Saucedo said.
   He said the gunmen seeking revenge for the non-fatal drive-by
shooting of a youth two weeks ago.
   The dispute involved two rival gangs that have been troublesome
in the past, Saucedo said.
   Alex Martinez, 16, was in critical but stable condition at
William Beaumont Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
and hip. Less seriously injured were David Munoz, 16, and Ramon
Rodarte, 17.
   Austin High School principal John Doran expressed shock and
asked students who witnessed the shooting to come forward.
   ``I'm very upset about it. It frightens me when I think about
what could have happened to other students, besides the ones who
were wounded today,'' he said.

<HEAD>Washington State Asks Whether It Can Kill Troublesome Sea Lions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state is seeking clarification from
the federal government on whether the state can kill some sea lions
that annually devastate a run of seagoing trout, officials said
Friday.
   While the state waits for an answer, it plans to truck the worst
offenders to their California breeding grounds and harass the
remainder with firecrackers and rubber-tipped arrows, among other
devices.
   As many as 40 sea lions have gathered annually near the Ballard
Locks for the last eight years to dine on the wild steelhead that
must negotiate a fish ladder there on their spawning migration from
Puget Sound to inland streams.
   The sea lions weren't considered a problem until 1985, when they
caught 30 percent of the wild fish run. Last year they ate an
estimated 65 percent of the run, allowing just 687 fish out of a
run of 1,973 to pass the fish ladder.
   At that rate, the run would be extinct within a decade, Curt
Smitch, director of the state Department of Wildlife, said Friday.
   This year, officials hope 816 of 2,093 fish will survive to
spawn.
   The sea lions are protected under the federal Marine Mammal
Protection Act. The steelhead are protected under state _ not
federal _ law.
   Within a month, federal authorities will begin gathering public
comment on whether the Marine Mammal Act allows killing protected
animals in cases where they are destroying other wildlife, Rolland
Schmitten, Northwest regional director of the National Marine
Fisheries Service, said Friday.
   Washington state had asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which enforces the act, for the ruling last fall.
   The public comment period should last between 60 and 90 days and
a federal ruling on the question should be made by year's end, in
time for next year's steelhead run, Schmitten said.

<HEAD>FBI Probing Crash Survivor's Connection to Medellin Cartel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI said Friday it is investigating
a report that a survivor of the Avianca jet crash who was found to
have swallowed packets of cocaine may be a hit man for the Medellin
drug cartel.
   FBI spokeswoman Lorraine Johnson said the Colombian government
had informed the bureau that Antonio Zuluage, a 46-year-old
Colombian national, may be a hired killer for the notorious
drug-trafficking organization.
   She said federal agents are working with Colombian authorities
to determine if Zuluage is the same man known as a killer in
Colombia. The investigation should take several days, she said.
   Zuluage is being held on drug possession charges in the Nassau
County Medical Center's prison ward, where he is listed in
satisfactory condition with back and arm injuries sustained in the
plane crash. Seventy-three people died in that accident.
   Assistant District Attorney Pamela Kelly-Pincus said Zuluage was
arraigned at his bedside on Tuesday on charges of criminal
possession of a controlled substance, a charge punishable by up to
25 years to life in prison.
   Mrs. Kelly-Pincus said that Zuluage has passed through his
system 29 bags containing what is believed to be cocaine.
   An attorney representing Zuluage had protested the recovery of
the material from Zuluage on the grounds it constituted an illegal
search. But the district attorney's office obtained a court order
authorizing the removal of the cocaine.

   North Korea said Friday that the United
States encouraged South Korea politically and financially to build
a concrete wall to bar free travel between the two Koreas and
perpetuate national division.
   At the 454th Military Armistice Commission meeting, North Korean
Army Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung showed a videotape and photographs he
said proved the wall existed. He demanded it be ``pulled down
without delay to ensure free travel and open doors full-scale.''
   South Korea says the wall is actually a series of cement tank
traps and bunkers.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt, chief United Nations Command
delegate to the armistice commission, refused to discuss the issue,
saying the structure was built outside the demilitarized zone and
not within the scope of the commission.
   At the two-hour meeting in this truce village, Vogt said the
North was trying to ``mislead the world public into thinking that
the South is solely responsible for a lack of free travel'' across
the border. He said the North should take its grievances up
directly with South Korea.
   Choe said the barrier was erected south of the 150-mile-long
military demarcation line at U.S. instigation. He said Washington
gave ``massive funds'' to Seoul in 1978 and 1979 to finance its
construction to prolong Korean division and block unification of
the two Koreas, split since 1945.
   The demarcation line divides the 2{-mile-wide DMZ into the
communist-controlled northern side and U.N. commission-controlled
southern side.
   Vogt showed a videotape of alleged North Korean barriers, some
of which he said were built inside the DMZ in violation of the
Korean Armistice Agreement which ended the Korean War in 1953. Choe
did not comment.
   Vogt proposed that a joint observer team should visit both sides
to settle the dispute.

<HEAD>FBI Interviews Conducted In Utah, Oregon, As Child-Porn Case Goes
Forward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents conducted interviews Friday in
a child pornography investigation involving a former official
official in the Utah and Oregon state governments.
   FBI Special Agent Tim Screen said people were questioned in both
states. He said no arrests were expected ``in the near future.''
   Agents were following up on the seizure earlier in the week of
45 videotapes and films from the residence of Scott McAlister, the
former inspector general of the Utah Department of Corrections who
resigned in December. McAlister resigned as assistant attorney
general in Oregon last year.
   McAlister has refused to comment on the investigation.
   On Wednesday, FBI agents confiscated 30 commercial adult films,
seven self-titled ``non-commercial productions,'' and eight
untitled tapes, according to an inventory of the raid filed
Thursday with a U.S. Magistrate.
   ``All we can say is we do have an investigation relative to
child pornography and the distribution of pornography,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lambert.
   When he resigned the Utah post, McAlister said he was weary of
``unfounded complaints and rumors'' about his performance,
management of the inspector general's office and sexual harassment.
   An affidavit filed by the FBI stated that last June a woman
informant received a box from McAlister containing 8mm movies,
including two which pictured children who appeared to be seven to
13 years old.
   Federal law prohibits transportation and distribution of
pornography involving children.
   The informant told Screen that ``McAlister told her he had
obtained these items while working for the Oregon attorney
general's office prior to moving to Utah.''
   A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against McAlister
with the state Industrial Commission.

   The Soviet foreign minister has proposed that the
issue of German reunification be put to an international referendum
because the world suffered so much at the hands of the Nazis.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in an interview published Friday, said
Europe must be assured that another militaristic regime will not
arise.
   ``It is not the idea of German unity itself but the revival of
sinister shadows of the past associated with it, as well as a
possible growth of militarism, that are met with apprehension in
the world,'' Shevardnadze told a group of Soviet reporters,
according to Tass, the official news agency.
   ``It's necessary to find a method of sounding out public opinion
in the most democratic and open way possible, say through an
all-European referendum with the participation of the U.S.A. and
Canada, or at least through wide parliamentary discussions,'' the
foreign minister said.

probably could not have found the terrorist bomb which destroyed
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Members of the Presidential Commission on Aviation Security and
Terrorism complained Friday that the giant and heavy bomb detectors

   Several members said at a hearing the devices should not be

the best of its kind, has gone through enough tests and should be
set up soon to make airports more secure.

leading biotechnology company, in a $2.1 billion deal some say will
boost long-term research.
   Robert Swanson, founder of Genentech, said Friday the merger

   Swanson, named chairman of the board on Friday, said at a news

``the resources and the independence to fully deliver the dream of
biotechnology.''
   Swanson referred to the 14-year-old company's need to be free

been needed to invest in products still in development and two or
three years from term.

   They swallow deadly drugs, plunge out of
windows, smash their cars and hang or shoot themselves at an
alarming rate. And they do it because suicide seems better than the
alternative: dying of AIDS.
   ``You have no control over this illness at all, so it gives me
some kind of control when I can say I can end my life any time I
want to,'' said Chuck Sporeman, a 43-year-old nurse who has AIDS.
   Sporeman tried to kill himself twice in December 1988, two
months after his male companion of 13 years died of AIDS. He said
he might try again when the disease leaves him unable to care for
himself, but participation in a support group helps, at least for
now.
   ``There are days where I wish I had done it, but there are other
days when it's a beautiful day, the wind is blowing through the
trees, I can go watch the waves crashing on the beach, and I'm glad
I didn't do it,'' he said.
   The author of a 1988 Cornell University study estimates about
1,000 AIDS patients in the United States will kill themselves by
1991. The study found people with AIDS are 66 times more likely to
commit suicide than the general population.
   ``It definitely happens all the time,'' said Andrew Weisser,
spokesman for AIDS Project Los Angeles, a service agency where five
of 2,100 AIDS-infected clients killed themselves in December.
   The relatively small number of AIDS-related suicides reported
publicly ``is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Weisser said.
   ``There's no way for us to keep track,'' said Los Angeles County
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher. ``If someone comes off a
building, we don't know if they have AIDS. If they shoot
themselves, we don't know.''
   Such suicides graphically illustrate that mental health budget
cuts and discrimination leave many AIDS patients without adequate
counseling, Weisser asserts. Many AIDS patients who discuss suicide
are ``calling out for help,'' he said. But hopelessness makes
others kill themselves:
   _A 28-year-old AIDS patient in San Diego drank all day, stole a
car, swerved down the highway without headlights, then triggered a
six-car accident that killed him and injured three others in April
1988. Paul James Curry ``was dying slow. I think he chose to die
fast,'' a friend said.
   _Two men who authorities said had AIDS tied themselves together,
then jumped 35 floors off their New York apartment building in 1985.
   _Philip Saylor, 40, took a revolver into Los Angeles'
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Jan. 2, shot and killed his longtime
companion, 35-year-old AIDS patient Steven Jenkins, then killed
himself. Police said Saylor also was infected by the AIDS virus.
   After that tragedy, several experts said suicide can be a
reasonable alternative if AIDS patients are thinking clearly and
fully informed of all options.
   ``People have a right to kill themselves _ not early on when
people first find they're infected, but when they have become
sufficiently sick that the quality of their life is not
satisfactory to them,'' said Dr. Neal Schram, a member of the
California Medical Association's AIDS task force.
   Rabbi Allen Freehling, a member of the Los Angeles County
Commission on AIDS, advises AIDS patients against killing
themselves, saying suicide is a selfish act that can compound the
grief of family and friends.
   ``In Ecclesiastes, it says there is a time to live and a time to
die, and I don't think the author of that statement meant we should
decide when that time is,'' Freehling said.
   A Cornell University study published this month found that
people who have just learned they are infected by the AIDS virus
but don't yet have symptoms are no more likely than other people to
have suicidal thoughts _ if they receive proper counseling.
   Dr. Peter Marzuk, author of the earlier Cornell study, found
patients face the greatest risks just after they are diagnosed, and
again when AIDS' effects on the brain cause depression, delirium or
other treatable psychiatric disorders.
   ``If you treat the depression, frequently these people will feel
better and not feel driven to suicide,'' said Dr. Geoffrey
Newstadt, a Cedars-Sinai psychiatrist.
   Marzuk's study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1988, found 12 suicides among 3,828 AIDS patients in
New York City in 1985. He called it striking that three of them
jumped from hospital windows _ an act repeated in 1986 by AIDS
patients at hospitals in Eureka, Calif., and Dallas. A Cedars-Sinai
AIDS patient jumped to his death a year ago, Newstadt said.
   Two other suicides in Marzuk's study had lovers who earlier died
from AIDS, which Newstadt said can spur the depression that leads
to suicide.
   Sporeman said he took care of his companion ``for the last year
and a half of his life, and when he died I, being ill, saw no
reason to go on. ... After the funeral, everybody goes back to
their lives and you're left all alone.''
   A study similar to Marzuk's found California men with AIDS are
up to 21 times more likely than other men to kill themselves. The
study, conducted by California's Department of Health Services,
counted 13 AIDS-related suicides in 1986.
   Marzuk wrote that many AIDS-related suicides go uncounted
because some people kill themselves without revealing they have the
disease, while others might be cloaked as overdoses of prescribed
medications or illicit drugs.
   Sporeman tried to inject a fatal air bubble and overdose of
medicine in his first failed suicide attempt. Days later, he
swallowed Valium and Percodan pills and downed alcohol as he walked
around his house writing a will. A friend walked in and stopped him
before he could swallow a fatal amount.
   Schram said it still is more common for AIDS patients to refuse
heroic medical treatment, to let themselves die, than to commit
suicide.
   There is ``a very thin line ... between maintaining a life and
taking a life,'' Freehling said. That line can be hard to define,
especially when AIDS patients often recover from repeated
infections before they die.
   Some AIDS patients ask friends or lovers to help them commit
suicide.
   In August, John Cleaves, 43, of San Diego was sentenced to 15
years to life in prison after being convicted of second-degree
murder for strangling Dennis Eaton, 40. Cleaves contended he helped
Eaton commit suicide.
   The development of AZT and other life-extending drugs may change
the way AIDS is viewed from a fatal disease to a ``manageable
chronic disease'' like some cancers. That could lower suicide
rates, Schram said.
   AIDS patients have a right to decide to commit suicide, Newstadt
said, but ``the problem is whether they have all of the information
available to them about treatment possibilities.''
   Of suicide, Sporeman said, ``Before the virus hits my brain or
I'm unable to do things for myself, I want to be able to do it. I
still have a plan to do it. ... Even if I don't do it, I feel I got
control over the disease, because I can say, `Stop.'''

<HEAD>World's Last Wilderness To Be Set Aside as Nature Reserve</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic to move Feb. 5</HEAD>

   A cold, windswept plain in Tibet populated with
scores of birds, plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth has
been proposed as the world's largest nature reserve.
   The Chang Tang Reserve, named from the Tibetan words for
``northern plain,'' would encompass an area the size of California.
The proposed territory covers one-sixth of the Tibet Autonomous
Region and adjoining parts of the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and
Xinjiang, said George Schaller, an American biologist who has
explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just
days ago.
   ``It's one of the last, almost unexplored places on the face of
the Earth,'' said Schaller, of Wildlife Conservation International
in New York. ``It survives intact almost as it was 100 years ago.''
   Schaller, one of the world's leading wildlife biologists, has
done pioneering studies on gorillas, pandas, snow leopards and
other endangered animals.
   He is one of the very few Westerners to have entered the Chang
Tang region. Few local people have been there, either. Despite its
size, it has a human population of no more than several hundred
wandering herdsmen who live there for only a few months each year.
   When he returned from Chang Tang in late January, he brought
with him an agreement with the Tibetan Environmental Protection
Agency that outlines the steps to be taken to establish the reserve.
   An area of 100,000 square miles, about the size of Colorado,
will be set aside in Tibet. The Tibetan EPA will coordinate the
effort, with funds from Wildlife Conservation International and
Tibetan and national agencies. Proposed additions in adjoining
provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 150,000
square miles, an area the size of California.
   ``We want to, in the next few years, find out what's there and
the areas of particular importance,'' Schaller said. He plans to
return in July. The research will be conducted with the Tibet
Institute of Plateau Biology.
   The agreement calls the area ``a unique animal and plant
community which includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak,
Tibetan wild ass, Tibetan wild sheep, Tibetan gazelle, Tibetan
antelope and Tibetan brown bear, all of which occur only on the
Tibetan plateau.''
   When asked to describe the region, he paused, searching for
comparisons to convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area
unlike any other.
   It has ``the aura of the Serengeti'' in East Africa, he said.
``You travel and travel toward a distant horizon, and the world
seems to expand in front of you.''
   The reserve is a high-altitude steppe at an elevation of about 3
miles. It is covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high,
lakes too salty to drink from, and jagged, inhospitable mountains.
   Winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero.
Snow can fall any day of the year. ``And the winds,'' Schaller
said. ``Oh, how the winds can howl across there.''
   Four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau,
along with 60 species of birds. Wild yak gather in herds of 100 or
150. ``It's a real desert area, but it has oases around which
animals congregate'' by the thousands, he said.
   Access to the reserve is normally by way of Lhasa, the Tibetan
capital, a week's drive south of the proposed reserve. ``I've gone
in from the north by camel caravan, but you cross such desolate
country, it's difficult,'' Schaller said.
   The trip from Lhasa isn't a simple excursion either. ``You need
two cars and a truck to carry gas,'' he said. Because of the need
to carry gas, expeditions normally last no more than three months,
he said.
   ``My preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and
live in there for a few years,'' he said. ``But politically that's
not feasible.'' Schaller is willing, but ``most of the local people
have families and they don't want to be out,'' he said.
   In an area so remote, is the establishment of a nature reserve
really necessary?
   ``There is no such thing as a remote area any more,'' Schaller
said. ``It's known there are minerals there. Near there oil has
been discovered.''
   Recalling the bison that once roamed the American plains in
uncounted numbers, he said, ``They destroyed the bison in 15
years.''

<HEAD>Credit Rating Agencies Wield Immense Power Over Companies,
Governments</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for the weekly fixture BC-Credit Markets.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

   Corporate titans and government officials cringe
before them.
   These two Wall Street companies are far from household names,
but when they flex their muscles they can influence businesses to
sell divisions, lay off employees or slash spending.
   The companies are the two major credit-rating agencies, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Several recent
events again have demonstrated their power over corporate America.
   Because a credit rating affects the rate of interest a company
must pay to borrow money, it is a powerful weapon. By threatening
to lower a company's rating, Moody's and S&amp;P can influence it to
take steps to strengthen its finances.
   Moody's and S&amp;P have a similar influence over state and local
governments that issue bonds. And when a government has to pay more
interest, it may be forced to increase taxes or cut services.
   Recently, Moody's showed its strength by persuading Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. to restructure its operations.
   Shearson, threatened with a rating downgrade, announced it would
raise about $850 million through private stock placements to
bolster its finances. The brokerage also sold a financial
counseling subsidiary to American Express Co., Shearson's largest
stockholder, netting $56 million.
   The power of the credit-rating agencies was shown more
graphically late last month when Moody's downgraded its rating of
debt issues of RJR Nabisco, the food and cigarette giant taken
private in a record $24.53 billion buyout last year. In addition,
Moody's assigned a lower-than-expected rating to an upcoming $1.25
billion RJR Nabisco bond issue.
   Moody's action sent RJR Nabisco's junk bonds into a tailspin,
reducing the market price of some issues by 10 percent. It also
rattled the entire high-yield bond market and briefly depressed
stock prices.
   Harold Goldberg, chairman of Moody's corporate rating committee,
said the company does not consider the potential market impact of a
ratings change. But, he said, it is not oblivious to that factor.
   ``Our role in the marketplace is that of an independent provider
of credit opinions,'' he said. ``If we were to withhold information
that we think is relative we would be abusing our role.''
   The market reaction to ratings changes usually is predictable,
Goldberg said. However, with RJR Nabisco, ``We did not expect the
impact on the markets we saw.''
   Marshall Blume, a professor of finance at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said the impact of a ratings change
depends on whether it is anticipated by the markets.
   Many changes are expected based on information a company has
disclosed publicly, so the price of its bonds already reflect the
expected upgrade or downgrade, he said. But changes that come out
of the blue pack the wallop of the RJR Nabisco move.
   Companies pay the ratings agencies to judge their securities.
They also provide the agencies confidential information on their
finances and business projections.
   When Moody's has concerns about a company it rates, it notifies
it and asks what its plans to do about it, Goldberg said. Once the
company responds, ``we would give them feedback.''
   ``I don't call that a negotiating process myself but rather an
interchange of information,'' he said. ``It's based on mutual
trust.''
   Once a ratings decision is made, it is released to the company
and public simultaneously, he said. Goldberg said there is no
appeal process, but that all ratings are continuously re-evaluated.
   Goldberg said Moody's is aware of its influence in the
marketplace.
   ``We wouldn't be providing these opinions if we had no
influence,'' he said. He said the ratings process has ``been
tested, it's been relied upon and it's quite material to the total
capital formation process. We take this role quite seriously.''
   Goldberg said the two major ratings agencies are not a monopoly.
Major buyers of securities and brokerages have their own in-house
ratings systems, he said. In addition, several smaller rating
agencies provide competition.
   Also, he said, ratings are just one factor that determines the
price and market for securities.
   The treasurer of a major corporation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said his company often disagrees with ratings agencies
over facts and interpretations of his company's finances. He said
the agencies are not always open to such discussions and that some
appear arrogant about their role.
   ``The function that they perform, performed right, is a useful
one,'' he said. ``I get a little concerned about the fact ... that
somebody who doesn't know your business very well can have that
much power over it.''
   Blume said the ratings agencies are kept in line by the need to
maintain their reputations.
   ``If they were to abuse their power they would no longer be
credible,'' he said. ``They're not capricious.''
   Still, they are not spared criticism. The Wall Street Journal
editorialized last year that the agencies were asleep while the
finances of Massachusetts crumbled.
   The Journal said the credit agencies failed to give investors in
Massachusetts bonds advance warning of the state's impending
financial crisis, which eventually resulted in a drastic lowering
of its bond rating. The Journal cited similar delays in foretelling
the doom at the Washington Public Power Supply System, whose
default on $2.25 billion in bonds in 1983 was the largest in
municipal bond history.
   The Journal said the credit agencies suffer from ``a fundamental
conceit: that they are smarter than the marketplace.''

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Friday its dealers will
begin offering quick oil changes nationwide, following a similar
program begun nearly a year ago by Ford Motor Co.
   The GM program will be phased in among its 7,400 Mr. Goodwrench
dealerships, which meet higher service standards that other GM
dealers. The nation's largest automaker has about 9,700 franchised
U.S. dealerships, including Goodwrench dealers.
   Like other oil-change operations, GM's and Ford's, which began
in April 1989, offers new oil filters, fresh oil, some lubrication
and inspections.
   The service generally costs around $20 and appointments usually
are not necessary.

<HEAD>January Defies Expectations, History?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After welcoming the decade in high style with
the Dow Jones industrials hitting a record, the stock market
sputtered and ended the month with hardly a benefit from the
so-called January effect.
   Except for the first and last trading days and a few sessions in
between, cash-rich institutional investors who sold stocks last
year for tax purposes did not put their money back to work on Wall
Street as in many Januarys past.
   Disappointing corporate profits, rising interest rates and
uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's credit policy were some of
the reasons investors apparently decided to sit it out.
   ``We ended the year thinking a soft landing was a guaranteed
phenomenon followed by the Fed easing and lower interest rates,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis.
   Instead, data suggested the economy was weakening further and
the Fed's ability to loosen credit was slowed by concern about the
dollar and keeping it competitive against other currencies, said
Goldman.
   ``The January effect, we had two days of it _ in December,''
Goldman said. ``January basically turned into a disaster, one of
the worst on record.''
   In fact, some Wall Streeters said the January effect wasoffset
by the Japanese effect _ the ability of the Japanese market to
influence, if not decide, the outcome of the U.S. market.
   ``... U.S. stocks virtually duplicated a downturn on the Tokyo
exchange, the first clear indication that Tokyo may now be calling
the tune in New York,'' Standard &amp; Poor's economists wrote in their
Jan. 31 edition of The Outlook.
   The Bank of Japan raised its discount rate, the interest it
charges for loans to commercial banks, four times in late 1989 to
cool the local economy and curtail inflation. That shook the
Japanese stock and bond markets, and sent tremors all the way to
Wall Street.
   Economist Edward Yardeni with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said the Japanese interest rate hike undoubtedly contributed to the
slump in the U.S. stock market.
   ``Our market was vulnerable because in the last year bullish
props had fallen apart,'' Yardeni said.
   Those props ranged from a slump in the takeover speculation
buoying stocks to a realization that corporate profits are weak,
Yardeni said.
   Although investor concerns about the business outlook were felt
in the stock market's last sessions in January, the market ended
the month and started February on a slightly more upbeat note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials showed a net gain for
the week of 43.47 points, closing at 2,602.70. Still, that's more
than 200 points lower than where it began in January.
   Among broader averages, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index was 2.54 higher than the previous week, ending at 182.75; the
NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged up
0.88 to 422.21; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
gained 2.69 to 353.56.
   However, the gains came on lighter volume as many big
institutional investors remained cautious and noncommital.
   Big Board volume averaged 169.09 million shares a day, down from
an average 181.19 million the week before.
   The Japan market's impact on U.S. trading reflects an integrated
global marketplace and does not necessarily suggest that U.S.
markets are now taking their cue from Japan, some analysts say.
   ``Sometime ago the Tokyo market seemed to follow the U.S.
market. Now everybody is watching everybody else,'' said Theodore
Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp. in Cleveland.
``It's very much a mutual effect. It's hard to say that one is
determining the other.''
   Despite the external influences, January effect is viewed by
some as an indicator of how the rest of the year will stack up.
Historically, if the market in general and small stocks in
particular do well in the early stages of the year, as the effect
suggests, the rest of the year will go well.
   Yale Hirsch, an Old Tappan, N.J., investment adviser and
publisher of the annual Stock Trader's Almanac, says the direction
stock prices take in January has foreshadowed the full year's
outcome correctly all but three times since 1950.
   While many Wall Streeters might not place much faith in the
January effect, its record over the years gives some people pause
to consider. On the other hand, in the 23 years that the Super Bowl
has been played, a victory by a team from the original NFL has
always been followed by an up year for stock prices.
   ``If the rest of the year rest of year is going to go the way
January went, I feel very bad,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice
president for First Albany Corp. ``On the other hand, if it follows
the Super Bowl effect then it should go very well.''

<HEAD>Double Whammy on Wall Street: NYSE Chief Retiring, Shearson Boss
Quits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The announced departures of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. Chairman Peter Cohen and New York Stock Exchange
Chairman John Phelan seemed to parallel their extracurricular
pastimes.
   Skiing enthusiast Cohen raced downhill and crashed. Phelan is
sailing into the sunset.
   Both men had in many ways come to symbolize the most turbulent
times in Wall Street history. Their prominence was partly due to
the great rise and then crash of the bull market and the securities
industry's struggle to readjust.
   Their decisions to leave, both announced this past week, brought
two very different stories to a coincidental close.
   Cohen, 43, piloted Shearson through an enormous expansion that
made it the second-largest U.S. investment bank behind Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. Much of the growth stemmed from its $1 billion
acquisition of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., the sickly brokerage that
practically collapsed after the 1987 crash.
   The Hutton purchase gave Cohen his first prolonged public
exposure. Once considered a shy workaholic with a penchant for
skiing, he came to be regarded as a shrewd strategist in what was
then a world turned upside down by the crash-related uncertainties
of investing.
   Later Cohen embellished his reputation as a gutsy financial
brawler by launching Shearson into the risky but lucrative business
of corporate takeovers. For a while, Shearson was bankrolling more
leveraged buyouts and other debt-financed deals than most rivals.
Cohen's hubris seemed to grow in proportion.
   In hindsight, that may have been part of his demise. When
Shearson emerged as the financier for a group seeking to buy RJR
Nabisco Inc. in the biggest LBO of all time, Cohen angered skiing
buddy Henry Kravis, head of the leading firm specializing in LBOs.
Kravis outmaneuvered him and bought RJR for $25 billion.
   The RJR humiliation, Hutton indigestion, a slumping stock market
and severe decline in the takeover business combined to wallop
Shearson's earnings and stock price. The company's swollen size,
once considered a strategy of strength, now seemed part of its
weakness.
   Brash, arrogant and increasingly isolated, Cohen alienated
subordinates and parent company American Express Co. He quit under
pressure and a conservative American Express appointee replaced him.
   For Phelan, 58, the finale looks almost as serene as a gentle
breeze on the Long Island Sound where he goes sailing.
   After announcing that he will retire at the end of the year,
capping nearly seven years at the helm of the nation's largest
stock market, Phelan was widely complimented for his management
skills, quiet tenacity and even-tempered handling of the Black
Monday panic in 1987.
   Perhaps more important, Phelan was credited with modernizing the
Big Board's communications and technology, promoting the idea of
global securities markets and helping guide the exchange through an
era of dramatic expansion.
   Still, Phelan will leave his post with some important issues
unresolved. One of the most contentious is how to control
computerized program trading, a strategy that can instantly flood
the market with sell or buy orders.
   Critics say it has injected scary volatility into the market and
is keeping many investors from buying stocks. Defenders say its
influence is negligible.
   Phelan preferred to take the middle ground on this and other
controversial issues, striking a delicate balance between competing
interests.
   ``Markets and the exchange are the kinds of institutions where
you cannot press a button and resolve them overnight,'' he said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress the risk
of recession has declined. His remarks were interpreted by the
financial markets as a signal that the central bank won't ease
credit, despite other evidence of economic weakness.
   _Some prominent American industrial corporations such as
Coca-Cola and USX reported sharply higher earnings, but much of the
corporate outlook elsewhere looked bleak _ especially in the
automobile business, where bad news bearers ranged from corporate
headquarters to federal court. Chrysler said it was closing a plant
that would sharply reduce its capacity. Ford lost a windshield
wiper patent infringement suit that could prove costly to all
automakers.
   _America discovered the descendants of Bolsheviks go for burgers
and beard-busters. McDonald's opened its celebrated joint-venture
in Moscow, and Gillette Co. said it would establish a $50 million
Soviet razor blade factory.
