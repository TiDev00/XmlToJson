   A former stockbroker who bilked his golf buddies
and other associates of more than $2 million was sentenced Monday
to five years in prison after pleading guilty to federal mail fraud
and other charges.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward Harrington sentenced Walter F.
Curran, a former stockbroker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., to two
concurrent five-year terms followed by five years probation for
mail and bank fraud.
   A condition of his probation is that Curran reimburse his
victims.
   Harrington called the crime ``deliberate and calculated fraud.''
   ``It was fraud of enormous proportions,'' he said. ``One of the
predominant motivations was excess greed.''
   Curran, 47, who pleaded guilty to 13 counts of mail fraud and
bank fraud, told the court he understood the serious nature of his
crime.
   ``It's been a very trying period for everyone concerned with
this,'' he said.
   Curran also pleaded guilty to one count of violating currency
transaction reporting laws, for which he received a 13-month
sentence to be served concurrently with the other sentences. That
charge was filed in New York after Curran was found to be carrying
$132,000 in cash when he was arrested at the Canadian border last
February.
   As part of his sentence, Curran was ordered to pay more than
$260,000 to the Bank of Boston Corp. for overdrawing money in a
series of checking transactions.
   Curran was suspended from Dean Witter Reynolds in February 1989,
when he was arrested in connection with the disappearance of $2.39
million he had convinced friends and associates to invest in his
personal account instead of with Dean Witter.
   Defense attorney Robert Cordy described the broker from
Wellesley as a decent and engaging man, ``probably the most
generous person I have ever met,'' who became desperate when he
could not fulfill promises he had made to his investors.
   Starting in April 1981, Curran solicited money from eight
people, including two golfing companions, as well as his accountant
and his lawyer at the time, Cordy said.
   Cordy said Curran promised them interest payments of 20 percent
if they invested in a deferred compensation account in his name.
Instead, however, over the eight years Curran invested $3.6 million
in the stock market and other ventures.
   During that time, the funds suffered ups and downs, but when the
market collapsed on Black Monday in October 1987, Curran lost his
investors' money, as well as much of his own, Cordy said.
   ``He had tried everything, from gambling to long shots,'' Cordy
said. ``Eventually when everything came crashing down, there was no
way he could continue to juggle the balls and get the money back.''
   Faced with huge losses, Curran fled to Canada and when he
disappeared, his scheme came to light. He surrendered to
authorities in Massena, N.Y.

<TEXT>
   The reinstatement of the African
National Congress has brought little joy or hope to South Africa's
black townships and activists say it won't change the harsh lives
of millions of poor blacks.
   President F.W. de Klerk's announcement Friday that the ANC and
other anti-government groups no longer will be banned, along with
other reforms, prompted few celebrations in the sprawling townships.
   While many foreign leaders hailed de Klerk's pronouncements,
just a few thousand of the country's 28 million blacks marched or
celebrated in most cities.
   While applauding de Klerk's call for talks to resolve South
Africa's racial problems, anti-apartheid leaders said the
concessions would change little in the short term.
   They said black, Asian and mixed-race South Africans want total
equality and full democracy immediately, with no special privileges
for whites. De Klerk hopes to preserve at least some white power
and little will change for most blacks, the activists say.
   ``Most of us realized that the speech did not change a single
bit of the political realities and the living realities of our
people,'' the Rev. Allan Boesak said in an interview.
   Boesak, a mixed-race clergyman and prominent anti-apartheid
leader, said the changes would not ease the plight of millions of
blacks who live in shantytowns, struggling to feed and clothe their
families.
   There is no reason to celebrate while most non-whites still face
chronic unemployment, malnutrition and poor education and health
facilities, he said.
   ``The realities of apartheid will take away what joy or
gratitude the people may have,'' he said.
   De Klerk's speech prompted no major celebrations in Soweto, the
main black township outside Johannesburg, with a population of 2.5
million.
   In Cape Town, a few hundred people, many of them children,
attended a township ``victory'' celebration.
   Boesak said non-whites do not trust the government after years
of repression and would have little faith in its statements until
they see real change in their lives.
   Many apartheid laws, enforcing the separation of the races,
remain in effect and power and privilege are still vested in the
hands of the white minority.
   ``It's going to take 10 to 15 years to make South Africa nice,''
said a young ANC activist taking part in a protest in Cape Town. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Activists said the modest black turnout to celebrate de Klerk's
speech also reflected a lack of political organization and
widespread apathy among many blacks that must be changed.
   Celebrations last year to mark the release from prison of Walter
Sisulu and other senior ANC leaders failed to fill a 70,000-seat
stadium in Soweto.
   ``Too many of the people are afraid or do not care,'' said a
labor union official, who also insisted on not being identified.
   While de Klerk promised to end apartheid legislation allowing
segregation of public facilities, government ministers ruled out
scrapping other apartheid laws at this time.
   Laws segregating residential areas and requiring South Africans
to register by race will be retained for now, the ministers say.
They say the government still strongly supports the right of ethnic
groups to live separately.
   De Klerk has spoken out against the concept of black majority
rule and said repeal of apartheid laws would have to be negotiated
as part of an overall settlement.
   ``When you see through this maze of excitement (over the
speech), apartheid is still very much intact,'' said Eugene Nyati,
a political analyst at the Center of African Studies.
   Anti-apartheid leaders say de Klerk and his National Party
remain committed to preserving a special status for whites that
would give them an indefinite hold on power.
   ``It is unlikely that the promised land of a non-racial
democracy will be reached before, at best, the second half of this
decade,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, an opposition Democratic Party
analyst.
   Black labor leaders are playing down de Klerk's reforms, noting
that the government has not ended the 3{-year-old state of
emergency, which gives police wide powers to curb dissent.
   ``The people are not satisfied,'' said one union leader, who
refused to be identified.
   De Klerk said he wanted to end the state of emergency as soon as
possible, but gave no date.
   The government must prove its sincerity with rapid and massive
change to end white-minority rule and ease the plight of millions
of poor blacks, Boesak said.
   Said the clergyman: ``If Mr. de Klerk really wants to give
meaning to what he has said ... to give some meaning and direction
to the grand vision he has painted ... he has to move very, very
quickly.''

<HEAD>Study Indicates Domestic Homicide Unpredictable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of domestic violence in Milwaukee
concluded that police cannot rely on past abuse incidents to
predict and prevent homicides in which a husband or wife kills a
spouse.
   The study conducted by the Washington-based Crime Control
Institute found that previous domestic violence was reported in
only one of 33 adult domestic homicides in Milwaukee during a
22-month period from 1987 to 1989.
   The study challenges previous research suggesting that most
domestic homicides are foretold by domestic violence calls, said
Lawrence W. Sherman, director of the study for the Crime Control
Institute.
   Police Chief Phillip Areola said the findings were ``unexpected
and disappointing,'' and would set back police efforts to improve
the prevention of spouse killings.
   ``Police have long hoped for a reliable basis for predicting and
preventing domestic homicide,'' Areola said. ``Unfortunately, the
Crime Control Institute research suggests we have not developed the
tools to do that particular job.''
   The study released Sunday found a group of 1,112 couples had an
average of more than three incidents of violence per couple during
the 22-month study period but none resulted in homicide.
   In contrast, only one of the 33 domestic homicide cases involved
a couple with a previous report of violence.
   ``Millions of dollars have been paid out by taxpayers and
insurers in lawsuits, all based on the theory that police can
predict and prevent domestic homicide,'' Sherman said. ``According
to the Milwaukee evidence, that theory is wrong.
   ``It's almost a suggestion that homicide and assault are two
different phenomenons,'' Sherman added.
   Joseph Weis, a sociology professor and director of the Center
for Law and Justice at the University of Washington, said he isn't
surprised by the study's findings.
   ``We aren't really very good at predicting any kind of crime on
a regular basis,'' Weis said. ``We can't tell you whether John or
Joe or Jane will kill their spouse ... even if there is a history
of violence.''
   But Carey Tradewell, executive director of the Milwaukee Women's
Center, said people who work with domestic violence cases do see a
pattern.
   ``What we see is that the longer women and men stay in a
relationship where there's violence without any intervention, there
is repeated violence and the violence is more severe.''
   Sherman said his data shows no evidence to support Tradewell's
observation.
   The findings contradict an earlier study conducted by the Kansas
City Police Department, which found that 90 percent of domestic
homicides had been preceded by a disturbance call at the address of
either the victim or the offender in a two-year period before the
homicide.
   The study will be published later this year by the Academy of
Criminal Justice Sciences and the Anderson Publishing Co. of
Cincinnati in a book titled ``Redefining Crime: Responses to Woman
Battering.''

<HEAD>Third-Grader Suspended for Bringing `Billy Beer' to Show-and-Tell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman is fuming because school officials
suspended her 8-year-old daughter for three days for bringing an
unopened can of beer to show-and-tell.
   ``I am furious,'' Melissa Woodfin said Monday. ``I have no
problem with them having a policy, but you can't treat a
third-grader the way you would a teen-ager.''
   Mrs. Woodfin's daughter Haley also must undergo counseling for
bringing the can of Billy Beer to school last week.
   The beer, named for President Carter's late brother, is no
longer made, and unopened cans are considered collector's items.
   Officials at Skipwith Elementary School in suburban Henrico
County said the suspension is consistent with their strict drug and
substance abuse policy.
   Superintendent William C. Bosher Jr. acknowledged that the
suspension of an elementary school pupil is highly unusual, but he
said the issue is serious.
   ``Suspending young people is not what we are about,'' Bosher
said. ``But we want to help young people understand that alcohol
and drugs are not appropriate.''
   But Mrs. Woodfin said the punishment did not fit the crime.
   ``My daughter has been treated unfairly,'' she said. ``She has
lost three days of school with no right to make up the work,
according to the policy.''
   Mrs. Woodfin said her daughter removed the can of beer from a
display case at home and took it to school.
   ``She took it for show-and-tell,'' Mrs. Woodfin said. ``She
didn't run into a closet and pop it open.''
   In addition to the suspension, police were notified that the
girl was in illegal possession of an alcoholic beverage.
   Sgt. James Price said the girl would be referred to juvenile
proceedings, ``which is nothing more than a counseling session.''
   Mrs. Woodfin said the can of Billy Beer was returned to her by
police and is back in the display case, where it will remain.
   Haley was back in school Monday after serving her suspension.

   After an hour of slaving over a hot grill, John
Sullivan's fourth-grade class was ready to dig into the sumptuous
meal of steak frites, emince de volaille friture and floating
island they had just prepared.
   Impressed? Well, don't be. Translated that's a simple fare of
steak and fries, fried chicken strips and caramel-topped meringue.
   And, OK, they didn't exactly slave over anything. But they did
giggle.
   ``Oh, yuck. I think I squeezed it too hard,'' said Eric Mattes,
9, who had a goopy glob of egg dripping down his hand.
   The youngster admitted he's never separated eggs before, but
then, that's what this trip was all about.
   ``It's a real world lesson, I think,'' said Sullivan, who
brought 18 pupils from the Dalton School, a private school on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, to the la Cite restaurant in
Rockefeller Center for Monday morning's outing.
   ``They get to find out how things work in a restaurant in a
major city,'' said Sullivan, adding, ``It's the most exciting field
trip I've ever been on.''
   The trip was courtesy of la Cite's owner, Alan Stillman, who is
known to the Dalton school kids simply as Michael's dad.
   Michael appeared delighted to share his kitchen expertise with
his schoolmates. He joined them in taking turns learning how to
bread, fry and grill foods, and, more important to this crowd, whip
up a little dessert.
   The egg separating proved a tad tricky for the kids, most of
whom ended up crushing the egg entirely or dumping the yolk in with
what was supposed to be pristine egg whites.
   ``Now you've got to go fish,'' pastry chef Julie Marx, told one
after another, showing them how to dip a demolished egg shell into
the blender to scoop up the unwanted yellow yolk.
   ``Is this high in cholesterol?'' ``How come it's OK to eat this
when it's cooked and not now,'' the kids fired at Marx as she
whipped the egg white and sugar mixture into a fluffy white mound.
   No one asked about calories.
   Actually, Jonathan Block, 9, considers himself a
fair-to-middling dessert maker. ``I make stuff a lot,'' he said
licking meringue from his fingers. ``My favorite dessert is ice
cream, bananas, chocolate sauce, cake, cookies and brownies'' _
together.
   Meanwhile, at the other end of the kitchen, others were busy
dipping, dredging and grilling. The meal the kids prepared costs
$28.50, including a salad and soft drink.
   The best part of the trip?
   Eating, of course.
   ``We never get anything like this at school,'' said Betsy
Mallow, 9.
   She rated the chicken better than the fast food kind and ``a lot
better'' than her mom's.
   ``My mother's chicken is just awful.''

<HEAD>Indian Timber Case Begins Before Federal Judge</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of attorney's name to `Siegler,' sted

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chippewa Indians seeking unlimited access
to about 1.8 million acres of forest should be free to harvest
timber without government regulation under 19th-century treaties, a
Chippewa lawyer told a federal judge Monday.
   Lawyers for several northern Wisconsin counties asked U.S.
District Judge Barbara Crabb to allow government regulation of the
Indians' activities to preserve timber resources.
   David Siegler, who represents the Chippewa's Bad River band,
said on the opening day of a trial to decide the matter that the
Chippewa do not believe all timber regulations issued by counties
are necessary to avoid deterioration of the forest land at stake in
the case.
   Siegler also told the judge the Chippewa believe the land
belongs to them.
   The forests involved in the case are managed by counties, which
make about $3 million annually from timber sales.
   ``It doesn't make sense to make the Indians pay for something
that is theirs,'' Siegler said.
   Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands retain the right to hunt, fish,
gather food and cut timber under court-affirmed treaties that ceded
northern Wisconsin to the federal government.
   Federal courts have upheld the treaties in rulings dating to
1983 in the case initiated by the Chippewa. The previous court
rulings left it up to Ms. Crabb to decide how the land should be
managed.
   Several other issues relating to the treaties, including deer
and bear hunting, are still pending. Others, such as tribal fishing
and wild rice gathering, have been settled.
   ``We will prove that our regulations are necessary'' for
preserving the timber resources of northern Wisconsin counties,
attorney Thomas McNulty, who represents the counties, told the
judge.
   The trial is expected to last several weeks.
   About eight counties are involved in the timber case, though 28
counties will be affected by the outcome.
   Assistant Attorney General Lisa Levin said the state does not
plan to charge the Indians a user fee, but seeks a ruling on
whether the Indians could hire non-Indians to work for their timber
harvest operations.
   She said the Indians ``want to expand the scope of the treaty
rights to non-Indians.''
   Crabb must decide to what degree county, state and federal
governments can regulate the Chippewa's timber cutting in forests
also used by the paper industry in Wisconsin.
   Tribal lawyers have argued the treaties allow the Chippewa
unlimited access to cut timber without the regulations or user fees
imposed on non-Indian loggers, and that they should have first
access to all the timber they can cut in county- and state-managed
forests.
   County officials claim the forests might be destroyed if user
fees are waived for the Indians since the money is used to replant
trees and care for the land.
   ``We're just saying that the Indians should abide by the same
regulations as everyone else,'' said Loren Sloan of the Wisconsin
Counties Forest Association.
   ``If they don't pay to protect our forests, the taxpayers are
going to have to pay for the Indians to come in and harvest timber
for free,'' Sloan said.
   Forest products manufacturers employ about 77,000 people and
produce about $8 billion worth of products annually in Wisconsin
overall, the state Department of Development reported.
   Unemployment rates on most of the six Chippewa reservations in
Wisconsin exceed 50 percent and Indians are looking to logging as a
way to boost their economies, Siegler said.

<HEAD>New Prosecutor Named in McMartin Preschool Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new prosecutor was named Monday to retry
Raymond Buckey on molestation and conspiracy charges in the
McMartin preschool case, and District Attorney Ira Reiner said many
of the charges could be dropped.
   Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez replaced Lael Rubin and
Roger Gunson, according to a statement issued by Reiner's office.
   Rubin and Gunson prosecuted Buckey, 31, and his 63-year-old
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on molestation and conspiracy
charges. A Superior Court jury acquitted the pair last month of 52
counts but deadlocked on 13 additional counts against Raymond
Buckey.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders scheduled a new trial for
March 9.
   Reiner said Monday the number of charges against Buckey probably
would be reduced because at least two potential witnesses, both
children, have balked at the prospect of taking the stand.
   The prosecution may ask that up to eight of the 13 counts be
dismissed, he said.
   His office listed 17 potential witnesses for the trial,
including all five children named in the charges, relatives and
doctors.
   Reiner said the list could change.
   Of the five children named in the remaining counts, two did not
testify at the original trial. The youngsters now range in age from
11 to 14.
   If convicted on all 13 counts, the maximum sentence Buckey could
receive would be 36 years in prison, Reiner said.
   If convicted of fewer charges, Buckey could go free because he
already spent five years behind bars, the equivalent of a 10-year
sentence, while awaiting trial.
   Buckey was released on his own recognizance pending the new
trial.
   Pounders has said the facts involved in the remaining 13 counts
``mitigate in favor of a long second trial.'' But Reiner said
Monday his office hoped to try the case in three months.
   Defense attorneys and parents of children who attended the
Manhattan Beach preschool criticized Rubin and Gunson's handling of
the original case, the longest, costliest criminal proceeding in
U.S. history.
   Both Rubin and Gunson requested reassignment before verdicts
were announced last month. They will assist Martinez in the
transition, Reiner said.

<HEAD>Susan Dunn Makes Debut at Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Search for the Next Great Verdi Soprano
resumed at the Metropolitan Opera as Susan Dunn, a rising young
American star, made her debut in ``Il Trovatore.''
   She may not yet be the answer to an opera lover's prayers. But
on the strength of her performance Monday night, the Arkansas
native is a force to be reckoned with for some time to come.
   In the grueling role of Leonora, Dunn displayed a voice of
considerable power, beauty and agility. And yet, she made a
curiously muted impression, never quite throwing herself into the
frenzy of the occasion when Verdi demanded it. Perhaps it was the
difficulty she was having in her upper register, where some high
notes seemed forced and one or two were omitted entirely.
   Even with that qualification, for sheer vocal luster she has the
edge over Aprile Millo, another young American who has been laying
claim to the heavy Verdi roles once owned by the likes of Leontyne
Price and Zinka Milanov. Another aspirant, Alessandra Marc, made a
debut earlier this season in ``Aida,'' showing phenomenal potential
and a lot of unresolved vocal problems.
   Dunn's was not the only debut of note Monday night. As the
villainous Count di Luna, Paolo Gavanelli, a young Italian
baritone, made an unscheduled debut, replacing the Hungarian Lajos
Miller, who had fallen ill. Gavanelli made a strong impression, his
medium-size voice brimming with vigor.
   The conductor also was new to the Met. Rico Saccani _ from
Arizona, not Italy as the name might suggest _ led a peppy and
idiomatic performance.
   It may sound like a bonus, but it wasn't, that the Met presented
not one but two tenors in the part of Manrico. Ermanno Mauro begged
off halfway through, complaining of tracheitis. Franco Bonanome,
who took over, sounded as if he might be headed for his sick bed as
well by the time the night was out.
   The finest singer on stage was mezzo Dolora Zajick, a powerhouse
who did full justice to the juicy role of the mad gypsy Azucena.
Whether singing softly or soaring above the orchestra, she was
thrilling.
   ``Trovatore'' is famous for having one of the silliest plots in
all opera, and the Met's production, new a few years back, is
almost as silly. The sets, by Ezio Frigerio, consist mainly of an
interminable set of steps, decorated by now-notorious shiny black
movable pillars that rearrange themselves during scene changes.

<HEAD>New Allegations in Covenant House Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Covenant House shelter for runaways conceded
Monday that it provided a dead boy's identity to a former male
prostitute, but refused to say how it obtained copies of the boy's
vital records.
   In another development, The New York Times reported that Roman
Catholic church officials were investigating allegations by a
second man who says he had a sexual relationship with the Rev.
Bruce Ritter, who founded Covenant House.
   Darryl J. Bassile, 31, of Ithaca, N.Y., told the Times in a
report published Tuesday that he met Ritter in April 1973, when he
entered a Covenant House intake center at age 14. Bassile said that
during his third visit with Ritter, the priest began fondling him
and they had sex.
   Bassile's accusations are being reviewed this week by a panel
convened by the Franciscans, the order to which Ritter belongs, the
Times said.
   Ritter said he remembered meeting Bassile only in passing, and
called the allegations ``garbage.''
   Only a minor's parents, their lawyer or someone with a proven
legal interest can legally obtain birth certificate copies, state
officials said, but an attorney for Ritter maintained no law was
broken.
   The disclosure put a new twist in the allegations against Ritter
by the former prostitute, Kevin Kite, who has alleged that Ritter
gave him money, housing and gifts in exchange for sex.
   Ritter has denied the accusations, and Kite's father has
described him as an emotionally troubled liar. Manhattan
prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating the use of
Covenant House finances.
   Covenant House, founded in New York in 1968, manages 17 shelters
with more than 2,000 beds in the United States, Toronto and Latin
America, directly serving about 25,000 young people annually. Its
$85 million annual budget comes mainly from private donations.
   Ritter has said he tried to help Kite get off the streets, even
giving him a new name to protect him from his former prostitution
ring.
   Kite was told by a Covenant House official that Warner was a
child from upstate Jamestown who died at age 10 from cancer, the
New York Post reported Monday. Kite said he was also given Warner's
baptismal certificate and blank Social Security and passport
application forms, the Post reported.
   Betty Anne Warner expressed shock in a telephone interview at
the use of her son's name, saying she and her husband had never
been asked.
   ``When I first heard it, I thought it was a joke,'' she said.
``I thought, oh golly, what's happening in this cruel world?''
   Mrs. Warner said she and her husband knew nothing of the matter
until they learned of it from a reporter last week. She said they
contacted the FBI and have been interviewed by a Manhattan
prosecutor.
   Timothy Warner died of leukemia in 1980. It was unclear how
Covenant House may have obtained copies of his birth record and his
baptismal certificate; Mrs. Warner said she has the originals.
   Covenant House said in a brief statement that it was ``deeply
sorry that the Warners have been hurt in this way. ... We never
imagined the Warners would be hurt.''
   The statement did not say how the identity was obtained. Bill
McAndrew, a Covenant House spokesman, said it had no further
comment.
   Stanley Arkin, Ritter's lawyer, said earlier Monday that he did
not know if Timothy Warner's name and records were used, but
maintained that it is legal to use such records so long as it is
not for illegal purposes.

<TEXT>
   A woman filed a $20 million negligence
lawsuit Monday against a Japanese manufacturer of L-tryptophan, a
dietary supplement linked to a rare and potentially fatal blood
disorder.
   Helen Jones, 52, of Portland claimed in the lawsuit filed in
Multnomah County Circuit Court that the Showa Denko company was
negligent in manufacturing L-tryptophan, leading her to suffer
eosinophilia myalgia syndrome.
   The rare disease is characterized by abnormal levels of
eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Victims complain of severe
muscle pain, weakness and fatigue, swelling in the arms, legs and
face, fevers, rashes and, in some cases, breathing disorders.
   L-tryptophan is an amino acid that has been sold over the
counter as a nutritional supplement and a sleep aid for decades
without harmful effects.
   Imports of L-tryptophan were halted in December after the number
of eosinophilia myalgia syndrome cases began mounting.
   By the end of January, nearly 1,200 cases of the disease had
been reported nationally, with at least a dozen deaths attributed
to it, according to officials with the National Centers for Disease
Control.
   Jones said in her lawsuit that Showa Denko has refused to
cooperate with U.S. health authorities, displaying ``callous
disregard for the rights and health of plaintiff and all the other
victims of L-tryptophan in Oregon and elsewhere in the United
States.''
   Jones, a forklift driver, claimed in her lawsuit that her health
is worsening and that other victims of the syndrome also suffer
deteriorating health.
   Dr. David Fleming, deputy state epidemiologist, said in December
that the condition of many eosinophilia myalgia syndrome victims
did not improve quickly after they stopped taking the dietary
supplement containing L-tryptophan.
   CDC doctors in Atlanta say there is no effective treatment for
eosinophilia myalgia syndrome, and they have nearly ruled out the
possibility that some unknown ingredient contaminated capsules or
pills containing L-tryptophan.
   Dr. Edwin M. Kilbourne, who is leading the CDC investigation,
has said L-tryptophan itself might be causing the disease, although
L-tryptophan manufactured by other companies apparently has not
triggered it.
   Jones' attorney, Gayle Troutwine, said Showa Denko is the
sixth-largest petrochemical manufacturer in Japan, with profits of
nearly $1.2 billion last year.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Guess Ownership Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday in a trial
pitting two families in a dispute over profits and ownership of
Guess, the country's top-selling jeans maker.
   The 12-member Superior Court panel will decide whether to award
damages to the Marciano family, which founded Guess in 1981 and
sold a half interest of the company in 1983 to the Nakash family,
which also own Jordache jeans.
   In the first part of the two-stage trial, a jury last year found
the Nakashes intended to steal for Jordache trendy Guess clothing
designs.
   The Marcianos now are seeking more than $500 million in damages
plus a return of the Nakashes' half ownership of Guess. Judge
Norman Epstein will decide whether the Nakashes must relinquish
their interest.
   Also at issue is disposition of a frozen account containing the
Nakashes' accrued share of Guess profits that contains more than
$93 million.
   Opening statements were expected Feb. 13.
   The four French-born Marciano brothers _ Maurice, Armand, Paul
and Georges _ also contend that the Israeli-born Nakashes _ Joe,
Ralph and Avi _ were responsible for destroying a Guess fashion
subsidiary, Gasoline.
   The Marcianos also named as defendants a Hong Kong couple, Lee
Sec Mon and his wife, who manufactured Jordache products in the
British crown colony. They allege the Lees were to have
manufactured Gasoline designs but diverted materials to Jordache.
   The Lees are unlikely to appear at trial because of an
outstanding warrant for their arrest on customs violations
involving garment imports, according to a source close to the case
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Founded on an investment of $170,000, Guess last year sold $500
million worth of blue jeans, men's and women's casual wear,
swimsuits, shoes, watches, eyeglasses and children's clothing with
the distinctive inverted triangle logo. Over the last four years,
Guess profits have averaged $45 million a year.

<HEAD>Youths In Largely Black District Attack Police, Firefighters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT typo in `blazes.'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attack that appeared
premeditated, about 200 youths in a troubled, largely black
district of Liverpool rammed a police patrol car with a stolen car
then hurled stones at police, authorities said.
   The youths also set fire to private cars in Monday night's
rioting and threw stones at firefighters who arrived to battle the
blazes, the police said.
   The district, Toxteth, was the scene of widespread rioting in
1981 and was among three largely black inner-city districts,
including Handsworth in Birmingham in central England and Tottenham
in London, hit by riots in the fall of 1985.
   Police refused to speculate on the cause of Monday night's
violence in the northwestern port city.
   They said in a statement that trouble flared when white officers
went to investigate reports of black youths in Toxteth arming
themselves with bricks.
   Two officers who arrived in a patrol car had the car repeatedly
rammed by a stolen car and faced a barrage of rocks, the statement
said. It said police believed the attack was premeditated.
   The statement said two police vans were also damaged in the
violence and three privately owned autos set on fire. It said the
youths threw stones at firemen who arrived to put out the flames.
   Police reinforcements arrived and drove the attackers off while
a police helicopter with a powerful spotlight flew overhead.
   One police officer was reported to have received a minor eye
injury when hit by a stone.
   Police said nobody was arrested.
   Superintendent Bernard Keegan, sub-divisional police commander
for Toxteth, said: ``I appeal to all parents, teachers and local
community leaders to help me in preventing this outrageous behavior
by misguided youths.''
   In the violence in 1981 and 1985, black youths said the cause
was police harassment. Drug dealing and other street crime is
widespread in the area and there is often violence when police
arrest suspects.
   Social workers say the underlying causes of the rioting in 1981
and 1985 were high unemployment among young blacks, poor housing
and other social ills.

<HEAD>Felled Trees From Hurricane Hugo Results in Too Much Mulch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since October, workers have been grinding
140 tons of mulch a day from limbs and trees felled by Hurricane
Hugo.
   There's so much mulch, Mecklenburg County is giving it away.
   So much, one huge pile caught fire from spontaneous combustion
13 days ago and is still burning, officials said.
   ``Come and get it,'' said Bill Warren, county operations
supervisor for recycling. ``We're grinding more than we can give
away.''
   For gardeners, the woody pulp is ideal for landscaping. It keeps
moisture in and weeds out. As the mulch decays, it enriches the
soil.
   The county once charged $15 a pickup load. But until all Hugo
debris is ground up, the stuff is free for the taking.
   After four months, the county has ground up only one-fifth of
Hugo's debris. The task probably will continue through autumn, said
Fred Remington, division manager of recycling. Mulch will then go
back on sale as part of the county's recycling program.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some might have thought the Army had gone hip
when U.S. troops started blasting rock 'n' roll music toward the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City to encourage Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's eviction in December.
   But the Army brass in Washington apparently wasn't too sure what
the guys were doing down there _ at least according to a list the
Pentagon provided later of the songs that deafened the Panama City
neighborhood.
   In citing just a few of the songs played on loudspeakers outside
the Vatican Embassy, Army Lt. Col. Fred L. Serene Jr. got either
the name of the song or the musicians wrong.
   Serene, a congressional coordinator, provided the list in a
letter to Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., who sought the information on
behalf of a constituent. A copy of the letter was obtained by The
Associated Press.
   In the letter, Serene wrote, ``Some of the numbers played
included `The Smugglers' Blues' sung by Glen Fry, `Take the Money
and Run' by Stevie Miller, `I Shot the Sheriff' by Eric Clampton,
`Free Bird' sung by the Lynrd Skynyrd Band, and `Nowhere to Run
To.' Twisted Sister was not one of the numbers played.''
   It's really Glenn Frey, Steve Miller, Eric Clapton, Lynyrd
Skynyrd, and the name of the Martha and the Vandellas song is
``Nowhere to Run.'' Twisted Sister is a rock group, not a song.
   Among the songs played but not mentioned by Serene were ``I
Fought the Law'' by the Bobby Fuller Four, ``Voodoo Chile'' by Jimi
Hendrix and ``You're No Good'' by Linda Ronstadt.
   Serene wrote that the 82nd Airborne Division Band based at Fort
Bragg, N.C., was responsible for the music, and he directed further
inquiries to the bandmaster there. But a sergeant with the 82nd
Airborne said he didn't think the band had anything to do with the
music played over the loudspeakers, and there was no immediate
response from the bandmaster.
   There also was no answer at Serene's office Monday afternoon.
   Noriega fled to the Vatican Embassy Dec. 24, five days after
President Bush ordered a U.S. invasion that toppled Noriega's
government and sent him into hiding. Noriega gave himself up to
U.S. troops on Jan. 3, and he awaits trial in Miami on drug
trafficking charges.
   The Vatican Embassy officials complained at the time about the
loud music.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said then that the music
was not a pressure tactic on the Vatican but simply ``fairly
standard practice'' to disrupt any attempt to eavesdrop on U.S.
officials' conversations. He said the same thing was done during
the 1988 Moscow summit.
   Of the choice of music, Fitzwater said, ``I'm certainly glad to
see the American sense of whimsy comes forward in this situation.''
   On Dec. 29, the troops turned the volume down so the music was
no longer ear-splitting but still loud. The next day, the music was
turned off.
   ``I am sympathetic to the papal nuncio's plea that the music was
keeping him awake while Noriega slept,'' a senior U.S. embassy
official in Panama City said on Dec. 30.
   Bush said the same day, ``I think it aggravated the people
inside. It has stopped. It would have aggravated me, I'll tell you.
I'm not into rock. Country music, maybe. That's different.''

   Individuals and corporations involved in
mergers or takeovers should consider the effect on their employees,
communities and society before signing on the dotted line, a report
recommended today.
   The report, ``Ethical Considerations in Corporate Takeovers,''
released by the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown
University, suggested executives consider ethical questions while
making deals.
   The questions range from: ``Are the terms of the transaction
consistent with the reasonable interests, obligations and
expectations of participants?'' to ``will the transaction reward
productive effort, innovation and leadership?''
   The report, summing up two years of conferences with prominent
members of the financial industry, government and academia, seeks
to offer ``an evaluation and recommendations for ethical conduct in
the financial industry,'' the Rev. James L. Connor, director of the
Woodstock center, said in the foreword.
   The report notes ``corporations do not exist in isolation.''
   ``They must be a constructive part of the larger society in
which they operate, and even shareholders who seek solely to
maximize their own profits will, as a practical matter, have to
take into account the interests of workers, customers and
communities, without whom the corporation would not exist,'' it
says.
   The participants included Michael Blumenthal, chairman of Unisys
Corp.; former Securities and Exchange Commission member Joseph A.
Grundfest; former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volker; Rep.
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.; and former Secretary of Defense Robert S.
McNamara.
   The 19-page report will be distributed to business schools,
financial institutions and other corporations, research centers,
government organizations and other interest groups.

   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., says he told a
group of Marines to stop taunting homosexuals in a restaurant, but
did not report them to their superiors as reported by male
prostitute Stephen Gobie in a magazine article.
   Frank also denies Penthouse magazine's report that he offered
Gobie $10,000 to $12,000 to help him get a new start in Florida
after they quarreled about the man's activities in Frank's rented
townhouse.
   Meanwhile, a campaign finance report released by Frank's office
shows that he drew hefty contributions from individuals outside his
district and political action committees while coping with a House
ethics committee investigation of his relationship with Gobie.
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, said Monday, ``Yeah, I was in
Mr. Henry's on Capitol Hill when some Marines were hassling some
guys and I went over and identified myself and told them to stop.
   ``But I never gave their names to the Marine Corps, because it
was right after the Lebanon bombing and I figured they were upset
and I'd give them a pass on it,'' he said.
   A Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon was bombed on Oct. 23, 1983,
and 241 servicemen were killed.
   Gobie is quoted in the latest issue of Penthouse as saying,
``One day, at a restaurant, Barney stood up to a bunch of Marines
razzing a table of gays. They were sashaying around with limp
wrists and laughing. So Barney says, `My name's Congressman Barney
Frank. Do you guys have a problem? Were you harassing these men
because they are gay?' He got their commanding officer's name and
reported them.''
   Outside of the account of his encounter at the restaurant, which
he said was partially correct, Frank said virtually everything else
about him that was attributed to Gobie in the article was untrue.
   Gobie is quoted as saying that he and Frank argued after the
congressman's landlord learned Gobie was operating a sex-for-hire
business in Frank's Capitol Hill townhouse.
   ``I told him I needed $2,000 or $3,000 to move to Florida,'' the
authors quote Gobie as telling them. ``I thought Washington had
tapped out for me. Barney offered me $10,000 to $12,000, but I
said, `I don't need that much.'''
   The article does not say whether Gobie said he received any
money. He has remained in Washington.
   Frank said the report was ``totally bizarre ... as is virtually
all of the new information'' in the article. Of the planned Florida
venture, he said, ``It's the first time I ever heard of it.''
   The ethics committee is investigating an allegation that Frank
knew Gobie was operating a prostitution business from his home.
Frank has denied the allegation.
   The congressman, 49, has acknowledged paying $80 to Gobie, 33,
for an initial sexual encounter. He says that after that they
became friends and he gave Gobie a job as a personal aide,
housekeeper and driver, firing him after learning Gobie was using
his home as a business base.
   Frank's financial report showed he raised $103,476 in 1989,
including $45,800 from PACs and about half of that coming after
Gobie's allegations surfaced in August. Of 46 individual
contributors, only nine live in Frank's district.

   Taxi drivers short on cleanliness or courtesy
will face long fines, thanks to a new ordinance.
   Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday signed the law calling for $500
fines to punish cabbies and the city's six taxi companies for
behavior deemed uncouth. The ordinance takes effect March 28.
   ``I think we now will see a new day in Los Angeles in terms of
cab service,'' Bradley said. He urged disgruntled riders to
telephone the Department of Transportation with complaints.
   ``We'll get action for you,'' the mayor promised.
   Department general manager Ed Rowe said individual driver fines
will be imposed based on customer complaints and observations of
city taxi inspectors posing as riders.
   The L.A. law establishes standards for cab cleanliness and
driver courtesy, and sets a dress code that prohibits drivers from
wearing tank tops, shorts and dirty clothing.

   Anguilla is not a real eel, insists state Sen.
Richard Matsuura, who says it is simply the victim of bad publicity.
   ``It looks like an eel, but it is a true fish with scales,
gills, fins, et cetera,'' he said.
   Matsuura is the current legislative champion of the nearly
annual bill to allow the importation of anguilla rostrada and
anguila japonica for research on raising them commercially as an
aquaculture product.
   There is a huge market for anguilla, which sells for as much as
$16 a pound in Europe and Asia, Matsuura told the Senate on Monday.
   The House Agriculture Committee last week killed the House
version of the bill after siding with biologists and
environmentalists who said there was too much risk that the
slippery critters would escape into the wilds and munch away on
Hawaii's native stream life.
   Live anguilla were allowed into Hawaii before 1974, primarily
for the restaurant business, Matsuura said.
   ``No one seems to know why the ban was placed on the anguilla
except that it looked like an eel, which it is not,'' he said.

   New York should tax Penthouse instead of
Plato and Playboy instead of Plutarch, according to a state
legislator.
   State Sen. Anthony Masiello says it's unfair that college
students pay tax on textbooks but that magazines bring no extra
state levy.
   ``How can we collect sales tax on the works of the great masters
while adult magazines and borderline pornography are trafficked
openly and freely?'' the Democratic lawmaker asked Monday.
   Under Masiello's proposal, the state would stop charging sales
tax on college textbooks. To compensate for the lost revenue,
Masiello would charge sales tax on ``adult'' magazines, which he
defined as any magazine that must appear in a brown wrapper at a
newsstand.
   All magazines are exempt from New York state sales tax. Other
states exempt textbooks from sales tax, Masiello said.
   Masiello said New York receives about $13 million a year from
sales tax on textbooks. He says taxing the magazines would bring in
about $9 million.

   ``It Counts for More Than You Think,'' is a
slogan about to begin bombarding Americans as the 1990 Census
approaches.
   A massive publicity campaign, designed to encourage
participation in the national head count, was unveiled Monday.
There will be both a national effort and specialized promotions for
special groups.
   ``This is Our Chance,'' Hispanic-Americans will be told in
Spanish-language advertising, while ``Stand Up For Who You Are'' is
the theme targeted at blacks.
   Print advertising aimed at American Indians carries the slogan
``Listen to the Drums, Raise Your Voice.'' For Asians, advertising
will feature an abacus and carry the theme ``Any Way We Add It _ It
Makes Good Sense to Answer the Census.''
   Five different advertising agencies have donated their work, the
50 state titleholders from the Miss America Pageant are serving as
census ambassadors and businesses across the nation are helping
out, officials said Monday in launching the publicity campaign for
the 1990 Census.
   Census Day is April 1, that's the day the government wants to
use as a snapshot of the American public.
   ``Participation is one of the most important activities each one
of us can do as citizens,'' said Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher.
   More than 100 million census forms will be mailed out on March
23, with a request that people fill out the answers and send them
back following April 1.
   Since getting an accurate count depends on public cooperation,
the Ad Council, a public service arm of the advertising industry,
was asked to help out. The result was the series of promotion
campaigns unveiled Monday.
   People who don't mail back the forms have to be contacted in
person, and every 1 percent increase in the mail response rate
saves the government $10 million, explained Mosbacher.
   Reaching some Americans is no easy task, however, and special
efforts are being made.
   Brenda August, Los Angeles census field coordinator, said a
former gang member has been hired to work with enumerators in her
community, seeking the cooperation of the gangs and easing their
distrust of government officials.
   Census workers will wear special vests so they can be identified
and receive safety training and travel in groups, she explained.
But they will not be accompanied by police.
   With red and blue colors used to differentiate the Los Angeles
gangs, Ms. August pointed out that both colors are being used on
Census products.
   Well-known athletes are being used to help reach people in
Chicago, said regional Census director Stan Moore. He said gangs
also are being worked with, and enumerators are being hired from
among the residents of public housing projects.
   Miss America Debbye Turner and Mosbacher filled out sample forms
at Monday's news conference, handing them over to Census Director
Barbara E. Bryant.
   Turner called for Americans to join together in answering the
census, and said the 50 state Miss America titleholders will become
encourage participation in their states.
   Census assistant director Peter Bounpane said many businesses
are also assisting. Included are ads being shown on the Goodyear
blimp, mailed ads being sent out by J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck
and Co., and donated space for census workers to answer questions
in many 7-Eleven stores.
   The national campaign, stressing the Census ``Counts For More
Than You Think,'' stresses the importance of census numbers in
locating public facilities, apportioning legislatures and
distributing federal funds to localities.
   That census answers are kept secret is also a major theme in the
Hispanic community, where distrust of government officials often
runs deep.
   Mrs. Bryant pointed out census records are kept private for 72
years and information about individuals is not given to any other
group, either government of private.
   Faced with FBI agents carrying a subpoena for census files in
1980, an agency official in Denver barricaded the office and called
Washington. The FBI agents were called off, she said.

<HEAD>No Stampede Among Tax Writers to Support Moynihan Tax Cut</HEAD>

   A widely publicized proposal for cutting
Social Security taxes apparently is not grabbing the attention of
voters and has little support among Senate tax-writers.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King said the agency's
toll-free number had received only about 60 calls on the tax cut
since it was proposed in late December by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``I don't find a lot of support in my state for cutting payroll
taxes,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Monday as
the Senate Finance Committee opened the first congressional hearing
on the bill. He said the subject has not come up at his public
meetings in Kansas and that his office has received only two
letters on the subject.
   Members of the committee praised Moynihan for turning the
spotlight on the way surplus Social Security taxes are being used
``for general government needs _ from aircraft carriers to paper
clips.'' But no one offered a solid endorsement of the bill.
   ``Not a good idea,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said of the
bill. ``A tax cut would be disastrous'' for future retirees, added
Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., agreed with Moynihan that Social
Security surpluses should not mask the true size of the deficit but
said the tax cut ``would almost certainly bankrupt Social Security
in short order.''
   Democrats treated the proposal more gently. ``This may be the
best answer we can find'' to stop the use of Social Security taxes
to cut the budget deficit, said Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., who added
he has not made a decision.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said use
of Social Security surpluses for deficit reduction can no longer be
ignored, but did not recommend how the problem can be corrected.
   Robert J. Myers, who helped create the system in 1934 and was
its chief actuary for 23 years, endorsed the reduction.
   ``The time has arrived when the financing of the Old Age,
Survivors and Disability Insurance program should be rationalized,
stabilized and made crystal clear by going to a pay-as-you-go
basis, as proposed by Senator Moynihan,'' Myers told the committee.
   Moynihan wants to eliminate the surpluses by rolling back the
rate tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and by cutting the rate
again next year, to 6.55 percent. The rate now is 7.65 percent of
the first $51,300 earned; employers match contributions from the
132 million employees.
   Congress and the Reagan administration planned for the Social
Security surpluses to grow by $1 billion a week when they
overhauled the system in 1983 to ensure benefits will be financed
when the large generation born soon after World War II begins
retiring in about 2012.
   Under the law, the surpluses must be invested in government
securities, which will have to be redeemed in the future to finance
benefits. But the surplus taxes are actually being used to finance
general government spending and to hide the true size of the budget
deficit.
   Robert M. Ball, Social Security commissioner from 1962 to 1973,
said if Congress eliminates the surpluses, the money should be
transferred into the Medicare hospitalization fund _ not used for
tax cuts.
   The Bush administration vigorously opposes the cut as a threat
to benefits and an opening for increases in other taxes.
Nevertheless, Social Security Commissioner King told the hearing,
``the administration is open to every reasonable alternative'' so
long as any change does not upset ``the sound financial footing ...
of the last seven years.''
   Bush said last month that Moynihan's bill is ``a disguise for
increased taxes around the corner.''
   The president wants to do nothing about the surpluses until the
federal budget is balanced _ 1993 at the earliest _ and then to use
surplus Social Security taxes only for debt reduction.

<HEAD>Environmental, Safety Flaws Called Endemic to Nuclear Arms Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says virtually all its
nuclear weapons plants appear to be violating safety, health and
environmental rules and the department itself is to blame for
failing to correct the problems.
   A report released by the department Monday said some of the
health and safety violations posed ``relatively high risks of
injury or death to small numbers of workers'' at the plants. Among
the problems cited was improper use of toxic substances and
electrical dangers.
   The report compiled previously disclosed problems at six weapons
plants: the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado; the
Fernald uranium processing plant and the Mound weapons laboratory
in Ohio; the Y-12 uranium plant in Tennessee; the Pantex weapons
assembly plant in Texas and the West Valley radioactive waste site
in New York.
   The report was prepared by the department to analyze the
findings of special investigations of the six plants by private
contractors and consultants. The rest of the weapons plants are to
be investigated during 1990.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins expressed dismay at the
conclusions, including a finding that five of six weapons plants
evaluated last fall were storing wastes in violation of federal
environmental laws and three were inadequately controlling
radiation.
   The report said other common problems include poor emergency
planning, a failure by plant managers to take environmental
regulations seriously and a shortage of skilled workers.
   The report blamed the problems partly on the Energy Department's
failure to impose tougher management practices at the plants, which
are owned by the government but run by private contractors.
   ``We must demonstrate that we are able to discipline ourselves
and our contractors,'' Watkins wrote in an internal memorandum
released with the report. ``Our inability to conform to our own
requirements is particularly disturbing.''
   One of the plants cited as illegally storing wastes was Rocky
Flats, which is under FBI investigation for possible criminal
violations of environmental laws. Watkins has acknowledged before
that Rocky Flats and other atomic bomb plants are not complying
with waste laws and has pledged to correct the problems as quickly
as possible.
   In his memorandum to department employees, Watkins said that
although he saw indications of improvements at the plants, he was
not satisfied that all managers take the need for further
improvements seriously.
   ``Steps to eliminate the `business as usual' approach to
compliance are still required,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Accident Study Shows Tired, Drug-Impaired Truck Drivers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials say they are
``surprised and disturbed'' by new evidence of fatigue and drug
abuse as major causes of fatal truck accidents.
   The evidence came in a report adopted Monday by the National
Transportation Safety Board, which found one-third of truck drivers
killed in the crashes studied tested positive for alcohol,
marijuana, cocaine, over-the-counter stimulants or other drugs.
   The study covered 182 fatal truck accidents in eight states _
about one-fourth of the national total _ between October 1987 and
September 1988.
   ``We are surprised and disturbed by the findings,'' said board
Chairman James Kolstad after the four-member board unanimously
adopted the report.
   The study said impairment of the driver because of fatigue was a
cause in 31.5 percent of the crashes, with just slightly fewer
attributed to alcohol or drug abuse.
   The safety board drew up several recommendations but postponed a
vote on their adoption. Kolstad said they include increased testing
for alcohol and other drugs, with a proposed demonstration project
to screen all drivers who pass a given weigh station rather than
current random testing.
   The board also will recommend tamper-proof, on-board recording
devices to identify drivers who exceed the maximum of 10 hours of
driving with eight hours rest.
   The board has no rule-making power, but makes recommendations to
federal and state agencies.
   Other proposals include state laws that would discourage any use
of alcohol or other drugs that might impair driving, including a
reduction of the tolerable blood alcohol concentration for
commercial drivers to 0.01 percent. The current level is 0.04, with
the legal limit for the general public at 0.1.
   ``The cab of a truck should be a drug-free zone,'' said Kolstad,
citing evidence than any amount of alcohol can impair driving.
   Drivers who are at the wheel for long hours often use drugs in
an effort to stay awake, said Kevin Quinlan, board staff member who
led the study. He said investigators traced the activities of each
driver in the study to determine how many hours were driven and,
when possible, how much rest the driver had prior to the accident.
   ``It's clear fatigue was a constant companion of the drivers in
this study,'' Quinlan said.
   Board member Jim Burnett said there also are indications of
inadequate medical screening of drivers, with 19 of the accidents
blamed on heart attacks or other driver medical problems.
   ``This study indicates to us we've got a lot of holes in the
medical qualification process _ holes that you could run a truck
through,'' said Burnett during board discussion of the report.
   Burnett said although drug use decreases as drivers get older,
they are more susceptible to health risks.
   The report showed marijuana and alcohol were the most common
substances found in tests of drivers who were killed, with 13
percent of the fatalities showing evidence of one or the other.
Cocaine was found in 9 percent of the fatalities, over-the-counter
stimulants in 8 percent, amphetamines in 7 percent and opiates or
PCP in less than 1 percent.
   More than 80 percent of the drivers who tested positive for
drugs had a record of prior abuse, and abusers were more likely to
have a suspended or revoked license and to have violated federal
regulations against long driving times, the report said.
   The study covered all fatal accidents involving trucks of over
10,000 pounds gross weight, ranging from straight trucks to
tractors with two trailers. It included cases in California,
Colorado, Georgia, Missouri, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Wisconsin.

   Savings and loan bailout officials are trying
to strike a balance between preventing fraud and efficiently
selling the mountain of sour loans and repossessed real estate
inherited from failed thrift institutions.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created last August to conduct
President Bush's S&amp;L cleanup, adopted ethics rules Monday governing
its employees and the thousands of private consultants and managers
it expects to hire.
   The rules for contractors were also approved by an
administration oversight board headed by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady.
   They are designed to screen out contractors with conflicts of
interest, a past record of fraud, a pattern of defaults or previous
involvement with a savings and loan collapse. They apply to anyone
receiving contracts worth $25,000 a year or more.
   The RTC is expected to take over about 600 failed S&amp;Ls with
assets of more than $300 billion. Its contracts will be a huge
opportunity for lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, real
estate brokers, appraisers, property managers and other
professionals.
   But, the cleanup also will present massive opportunity for
fraud. In a report last week, the General Accounting Office,
Congress' watchdog agency, put the disposal of thrift assets at the
head of a list of 14 areas in government most vulnerable to abuse.
   ``A sale of this magnitude is unparalleled in history ... (and)
highly susceptible to fraud, waste and abuse,'' it said.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House task force
overseeing the RTC, said tough rules are necessary even though ``in
some communities ... there is no one left to do the business except
those that have been involved in the losses.''
   ``The American public has a very low tolerance for this entire
S&amp;L issue,'' Vento said. ``To maintain any kind of public support,
you will have to demonstrate there is an effort to try to limit
those involved in creating the problem from profiting from it.''
   However, Paul Horvitz, a business professor at the University of
Houston, said regulators may be overreacting and causing delays
that will cost taxpayers money.
   ``The RTC doesn't want to deal with crooks or people who've
caused problems in the past. But ... in an attempt to be squeaky
clean, they may just run into time delays,'' he said.
   In perhaps its most controversial provision, the contractor
rules screen out anyone who caused a loss of $50,000 or more to
government deposit insurance funds.
   Some contractors complain that such a low limit bars practically
anyone who did business in Texas during the oil bust, when
thousands of people defaulted on home mortgages and business loans
from banks and S&amp;Ls that failed.
   Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the agency, said there is a
``strong likelihood'' many firms in Texas and other Oil Patch
states will be disqualified, creating a business opportunity for
out-of-state firms.
   Katherine Corigliano, the RTC's ethics officer, said the agency
will apply a ``rule of reason'' to interpreting the regulations.
Any contractor excluded from doing business under the rules can
offer an explanation and ask for an exception.
   That, however, places a burden on the agency's staff to make
thousands of case-by-case reviews. Officials plan at first to
conduct most of the reviews in Washington, but after precedents are
established, farm most of the work out to the RTC's regional
offices, which should be able to make decisions faster.
   ``It strikes me that it's going to be a terribly
people-intensive process,'' said RTC board member Robert Clarke.
   Lamar C. Kelly Jr., director of RTC asset and real estate
management, said the agency has already received about 10,000
inquiries from would-be contractors and expects that to increase
dramatically.
   The RTC hopes to begin awarding contracts on a routine basis in
April and May and could award up to $1.5 billion worth by the end
of the year, he said.

<HEAD>Foreign Tourists Post First U.S. Travel Surplus in History</HEAD>

   For the first time, foreign visitors are
spending more in the United States than Americans are spending
overseas, the Commerce Department reports.
   The United States gained a $450 million travel surplus last
year, Commerce Undersecretary Rockwell Schnabel said Monday.
   And Don Wynegar, research director for the department's U.S.
Travel and Tourism Administration, said the surplus is projected to
reach $1.5 billion this year.
   Foreign visitors spent $34.3 billion in the United States in
1989 while Americans spent $33.9 billion abroad. American and
foreign travelers spent an identical $8.7 billion getting to their
destinations.
   The USTTA said the nation's record travel deficit was posted in
1985, when it climbed to $9.4 billion. It attributed the turnaround
to foreign travel to the United States growing twice as fast as
Americans' overseas travel.
   The USTTA is forecasting a 6 percent increase to 40.7 million
foreign visitors this year and a 7 percent gain to 43.4 million in
1991. By the year 2000, Schnabel said, there are expected to be 67
million foreign tourists spending a projecting $89 billion in the
United States.
   Neighboring Canada and Mexico, as might be expected, had the
largest share of visitors to the United States in 1989, a combined
64 percent _ 15.2 million from Canada and 9.3 million from Mexico,
Wynegar said.
   They were followed by 3 million Japanese tourists and 2.2
million British visitors.
   Schnabel said the greatest growth in 1990 is expected from
Mexico, with an 11 percent increase to 10.4 million visitors.
Overseas arrivals, he said, are projected to grow by about 8
percent and Canadian arrivals by 2 percent.
   Overseas markets with the largest potential for continued growth
include Japan, Britain, Australia and Sweden.
   ``While arrivals from Japan and the United Kingdom seem to be
slowing slightly, averaging 9 percent growth per year, growth from
Australia and Sweden is expected to average 14 percent annually in
1990 and 1991,'' he said.
   Schnabel described the tourism industry as ``many different
parts making up the largest service industry in the world.''
   ``In fact, we are a $2 trillion industry worldwide, employing
over 100 million people or one out of every 16 people in the
world's workforce,'' he continued.
   In the United States, Schnabel said, the travel industry is the
second largest employer after health services, employing nearly 6
million people.
   And, he said, ``Domestic and foreign travelers together spent
$350 billion in the United States last year, making travel and
tourism the third largest retail business in the country (after
automobile and health services).''

   Although the Soviet Communist Party appears poised
to give up its constitutionally guaranteed grip on power, it is
unlikely to soon follow fraternal parties in Eastern Europe and
actually surrender the reins of power.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed to the party Central
Committee on Monday that the Communists take the historic step of
surrendering the guarantee they have in the constitution of being
the country's ``leading and guiding force.''
   Communists, he said, must earn the right to run the country.
   In taking that step, Gorbachev acknowledged the power of the
pro-democracy movement he unleashed when he began his reform
program upon rising to power five years ago.
   But he also understands that conditions are far different in his
country than they are in other Eastern European nations where
communist power crumbled, in some cases within a matter of weeks.
   Gorbachev repeatedly has said that no other political forces
exist in the Soviet Union that are capable of the wide-ranging
activities in which the party engages. For years, the party
ruthlessly repressed any effort to oppose it.
   In addition, the Soviet Communist Party has been in power much
longer than its fraternal former ruling parties in Eastern Europe _
which were forced on former satellites by Josef Stalin and thus
resented for nationalist reasons by the people of those countries.
   Through the years of Stalin's absolute rule, the Soviet ruling
party had no written guarantee of political power, and it was only
in the last constitution, adopted in 1977, that its monopoly was
assured.
   Encouraged by Gorbachev's reforms, opposition to authoritarian
Communist rule has grown in recent months. But the forces of
dissent still are widely scattered across this vast country of more
than 100 nationalities.
   The most widespread phenomenon is the birth of People's Front
political movements that have sprung up to press local demands for
more autonomy.
   The movements are strongest in the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. They began there less than two years
ago and are now leading to the formation of some small political
parties that will contest local elections this spring.
   Despite growing contacts between the People's Front movements of
various republics and regions, local issues still are paramount to
the groups and no cohesive national organization or program has
been established.
   In the Baltics, the People's Front organizations increasingly
are setting their sights on complete independence from the
Russian-ruled Soviet Union.
   Another organization, the Democratic Platform, has united
disgruntled Communists who are close to declaring the party
incapable of reform and forming a social democratic party.
   Democratic Platform joined with other groups to organize a huge
rally in Moscow on Sunday, the eve of the Central Committee
meeting, and demanded that the party give up its claim to exclusive
power.
   Its founding conference in Moscow in mid-January drew
representatives from many Soviet cities, but the organization lacks
money and access to official media _ advantages enjoyed by the
Communist Party.
   Many Communist leaders are likely to take a drubbing in the
local elections this spring, repeating the embarrassing experience
of balloting last March that were the country's first contested
national elections in seven decades.
   However, because of what opposition members called the unfair
rules of the game, about 80 percent of those elected to the
Congress of People's Deputies were party members.
   Communist officials are faced not so much with the prospect of
losing power to an organized opposition as they are with losing
their cohesiveness and the trust of the people.
   They are blamed for the dismal state of the economy, which has
wrought widespread consumer shortages, and resented for enjoying a
higher standard of living than most Soviets by virtue of their
power.
   Under Gorbachev's reform program, local and regional Communist
officials are going to have to give up the perks and privilege if
they wish to earn the public trust.
   But, as Gorbachev envisions it, centralized decision-making
would be scrapped and local officials would be permitted the leeway
to solve problems efficiently.
   That, the Soviet president feels, would boost the prestige of a
party which otherwise would continue its steep decline.

   A ruling that former President Reagan must
testify at an Iran-Contra trial could lead to a major
constitutional battle over the right of presidents to refuse to
testify or reveal confidential documents in court.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Monday ordered Reagan
to provide videotaped testimony at the trial of former national
security adviser John Poindexter.
   But the judge gave Reagan and President Bush until Friday to
invoke executive privilege to avoid testimony by the former
president.
   Greene also renewed his order that Reagan immediately turn over
33 diary entries to Poindexter. Reagan promptly invoked executive
privilege to avoid turning portions of his diaries over to
Poindexter.
   However, there was no immediate decision on whether Reagan would
agree to provide a videotaped deposition before the start of
Poindexter's trial.
   ``It would be inconceivable ... to exempt Mr. Reagan from the
duty of every citizen to give evidence that will permit the
reaching of a just outcome of this criminal prosecution,'' Greene
said Monday.
   Legal scholars said the judge's order could lead to a new
Supreme Court test of executive privilege, the doctrine invoked to
shield presidents from court appearances or divulging confidential
information.
   ``It remains to be seen what Reagan will do,'' said Georgetown
University law professor Samuel Dash, who was chief counsel to the
Senate Watergate committee in the mid-1970s.
   When Reagan was president, Dash noted, ``he told the American
people he believed he should be open completely in the Iran-Contra
case. I don't know whether he has changed his mind.''
   If Reagan refuses to testify on the basis of executive
privilege, Greene could postpone the Poindexter trial _ now
scheduled to begin Feb. 20 _ while the matter is appealed directly
to the Supreme Court.
   Given the importance of the issue, the high court could expedite
consideration of the case and hear arguments in the spring.
   The court's last word on executive privilege was provided in
1974 when it ordered President Richard M. Nixon to provide White
House tape recordings to a prosecutor in the Watergate bugging case.
   The justices in 1974 unanimously said, ``The general assertion
of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for
evidence in a pending criminal trial.''
   But New York University law professor Bernard Schwartz said the
ruling's impact is not clear-cut.
   ``What would have happened if Nixon raised a claim of national
security?'' Schwartz asked, suggesting the outcome might have been
different.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, obstructing Congress and
making false statements.
   Invoking executive privilege regarding the diary entries will
allow Reagan to gain access to a secret filing in which Poindexter
told why he needs the diaries.
   If Reagan determines the excerpts contain admissible evidence
not available from other sources, ``the former president may decide
to waive his claim of privilege,'' said Reagan attorney Theodore
Olson.
   Greene said he will allow Poindexter to question Reagan on a
wide range of subjects in the Iran-Contra affair, including whether
Reagan approved Poindexter's denials to Congress that former White
House national security aide Oliver L. North was raising money and
providing military advice to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Poindexter also will be allowed to ask Reagan about ``the
president's knowledge regarding the relationship of Oliver North
with specific individuals involved in Iran-Contra activities.''
   The president told the investigative Tower Board on Jan. 26,
1987, that he did not know the National Security Council staff was
helping the Contras.
   Poindexter has said Reagan took notes at meetings focusing on
congressional inquiries into North's activities to help the Contras.
   North tried to subpoena Bush and Reagan to testify at his own
trial. But U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell last year refused to
order either man to testify, saying North failed to show their
testimony would be relevant to his defense.
   North is appealing his convictions of obstructing Congress,
destroying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal
trial, although some have provided testimony or the rough
equivalent.
   In 1975, then-President Gerald R. Ford gave a videotaped
deposition in the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, convicted of
trying to assassinate Ford. The videotape was played for jurors at
Fromme's trial.

<HEAD>Sometimes Passengers Should be Told of Threats, FAA Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline passengers should be told if their
flight is the target of a terrorist bomb threat only if they notice
and ask about increased security precautions, the head of the
Federal Aviation Administration says.
   But FAA Administrator James Busey also maintains that because
most bomb threats are hoaxes _ up to 600 a year proving false _ no
public warning should be made in the vast majority of cases.
   Busey noted the FAA continues to insist airlines not disclose
the contents of the agency's security notices and bulletins
containing intelligence information on terrorist threats.
   ``I think passengers should operate on the assumption that if
the plane is going, there is no threat,'' Busey told reporters
Monday. ``If we cannot guarantee the security and the safety of
that flight, the bird does not fly.''
   But Busey said a distinction can be made when a passenger
arrives at an airport departure lounge and observes bomb-sniffing
dogs, the searching of carry-on luggage and other signs of
heightened security.
   ``The experienced traveler will know that something is going
on,'' he said. ``And they have every right to know'' what it is.
   Air travelers who ask should be told the reason for the
precautions ``to have the flexibility to make his own personal
decision independently,'' Busey said.
   But overall, he said, ``Our policy remains that we not go
public.''
   The issue of whether passengers should be told of terrorist
threats arose after reports that some U.S. diplomats were told of a
1988 bomb threat against Pan Am Flight 103.
   The aircraft exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   In separate incidents last year, Northwest and Delta airlines
broke from standard industry practice when they issued public
announcements that some of their flights had been threatened.
   Busey called in representatives of all major U.S. airlines for a
``listening session'' over the issue, apparently concluding there
are rare occasions when it is prudent to tell passengers their
flight has been threatened.
   On Monday, Busey spelled out for the first time an example of
such a rare occasion.
   Spokesmen for aviation watchdog groups and representatives of
the family associations formed after the destruction of Pan Am 103
have harshly criticized the FAA and the airline industry for
failing to give passengers adequate warning of threats.
   A presidential commission, formed to make security
recommendations in the aftermath of the Pan Am flight, is
addressing the issue of whether passengers should be informed of
threats. The commission's report is due in mid-May.

   The battle to restore the death penalty in
New York again may rest on a conservative Republican senator whose
bout with cancer has given him second thoughts about bringing back
the electric chair.
   Sen. James Donovan missed Monday's vote in the state Senate on
legislation to restore capital punishment, a measure Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo has promised to veto for the eighth straight year.
   A consistent death penalty supporter, Donovan was unable to vote
because he was suffering the side effects of chemotherapy, said
Edward Byrne, an aide to the 25-year Senate veteran. The
legislation was approved 40-20.
   The measure now goes to the 150-member Assembly where a vote
isn't expected until late February, at the earliest.
   Without Donovan's vote or a switch by one of the ``No'' votes,
death penalty advocates lack the 41 Senate votes needed to override
a veto.
   Thirty-seven states have death penalty laws. New York is the
largest state without one.
   The state's last execution was in 1963.
   Last year, Donovan said his battle with cancer had caused him to
have second thoughts about the death penalty. That was enough to
prompt the Senate's Republican leadership to scrap any attempt at
an override in 1989.
   On Friday, Byrne had confidently predicted Donovan would be on
hand for Monday's vote, saying ``he hasn't missed a day yet this
year.''
   On Monday, Byrne said he was not sure how the senator would
vote, but he insisted Donovan was not ``ducking'' the vote.
   The Senate's chief sponsor of the legislation, Republican Dale
Volker, said he was confident Donovan would eventually vote for
capital punishment.
   ``I've said from the beginning that Jim Donovan has always voted
for the death penalty and I think he will again,'' said Volker,
adding that he might even pick up some more votes when it came time
for the override attempt.
   The Senate action began what's become an annual event at the
Capitol. Every year, both houses pass the death penalty bill, Cuomo
vetoes it, and legislators then count noses to see if they've got
the votes for an override. Thus far, they have come up short.
   This year's battle has taken on additional meaning because the
governor's job and all 211 seats in the Legislature go before the
voters in November.
   Republicans, as in the past, are expected to make Cuomo's
opposition to the death penalty a major campaign issue.
   The legislation would permit the death penalty for the most
heinous murders, such as contract killings and the slaying of
witnesses. Cuomo, arguing the death penalty is debasing and not a
deterrent, has called instead for life-without-parole sentences for
some murderers. The GOP-controlled Senate has refused to go along
with that argument.
   New York state's electric chair hasn't been used since Aug. 15,
1963, when Eddie Lee Mays, convicted of murder in a Harlem bar
shooting, became the 695th person put to death in New York.

<HEAD>Government Says Tests Show No Antibiotic Residues in Milk</HEAD>

   The Food and Drug Administration says tests
for antibiotics in milk samples from 14 metropolitan areas show the
nation's milk supply is safe.
   The FDA said its findings contradict the results of screenings
by The Wall Street Journal and the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, which recently found residues of potentially harmful
drugs used to treat sick cattle.
   ``Our study indicates that the American dairy farmer is using
animal drugs carefully and conscientiously, and that the milk
supply does not contain unsafe drug residues,'' Gerald Guest,
director of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a
statement Monday.
   The Journal's tests, conducted by Rutgers University scientists,
on 50 retail samples collected in 10 major cities, found 38 percent
were contaminated with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat
sick cattle. This class of drugs includes sulfamethazine, a
suspected carcinogen.
   The survey by the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
conducted in conjunction with the Journal, tested 20 milk samples
from store shelves in metropolitan Washington and found 20 percent
were tainted.
   The FDA noted at the time the tests used in the screenings,
known as Charm II, can detect only classes of drugs, not specific
drugs within a class. It also said the levels of residues found in
the Journal's testing did not pose a public health threat.
   The FDA also used the Charm II method in its tests and got
``positive'' readings for 51 percent of its 70 samples.
   However, the FDA said it also used new testing methods that are
more sensitive and specific than Charm II. None of the Charm II
positives was confirmed by the new methods, the FDA said. Also,
testing for specific drugs found no contamination with
sulfamethazine, which is not approved for use in any food-producing
animal.
   The FDA samples were taken from Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami,
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco and
Seattle.
   Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, said the Charm II test is ``well documented
and reliable.''
   ``It's puzzling that the FDA would not be able to confirm any
samples that Charm II found contaminants in,'' he said. ``I think
the reason for the discrepancy has to be determined before one can
say anything definite.''
   The FDA said it plans to regularly monitor pasteurized milk for
the presence of drug residues to supplement testing by the states.
   The agency also said it will work toward adoption by the states
of new testing procedures. States currently rely on a method
originally designed to detect penicillin and which also detects
other antibiotics but not with the same sensitivity.

<TEXT>
   A monument commemorating the 25th
anniversary of the free speech movement at the University of
California at Berkeley has revived the bitterness over its legacy.
   Veterans of the protest _ which helped launch a decade of
dissent by the nation's youth _ endorse the idea of a monument to
their accomplishment, but the university's chancellor and some
faculty deride the proposal as a ``gesture of remarkable
arrogance.''
   ``We want something that is meant as a tribute and inspiration
to all freedom fighters,'' said Charles Schwartz, a physics
professor who last year dreamed up the idea of commissioning
artwork for the project.
   Since then, the proposal has garnered support from 100
professors, local politicians, students and most of the now
middle-age leaders of the free speech movement.
   But Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman, who must accept the monument
before it can be placed on campus, said he was troubled by the
proposal.
   ``It is not clear why the free speech movement of 1964 deserves
such special commemoration,'' he wrote in a public letter to
Schwartz and Peter Selz, a retired art history professor and the
former chief curator of the New York Museum of Modern Art.
   He added that those involved in the movement were ``not very
good at designing public art to commemorate their own actions.''
   In a subsequent statement, Heyman criticized public art on the
campus, saying statues ``do not wear well and they are vulnerable
to being defaced.''
   More than 270 people, including internationally known artists,
have submitted proposals for the artwork, and a seven-member
committee was scheduled to name five finalists today.
   Their work will be displayed and a final selection announced
March 3. Organizers, who have already raised $30,000, plan to give
the winner $70,000 to build the monument, which will be donated to
the university.
   The movement began in the fall of 1964 when philosophy student
Mario Savio and friend Jack Weinberg set up a card table to
distribute political material on the university's Sproul Plaza.
   The school had enacted a ban on campus political activities
because it feared civil disobedience actions were disrupting
classes.
   Weinberg was arrested and placed in the back of a patrol car,
but hundreds of students surrounded the automobile and for 32 hours
refused to let 600 police officers take him into custody.
   Photographs of Savio and others addressing the crowd from atop
the police car were published around the world, leading to sympathy
strikes by students until the university dropped its ban several
months later.
   The often iconoclastic proposals to commemorate the
confrontation include a huge screw; two chairs facing each other on
two pedestals; a giant megaphone; three monkeys in a cage; a
suspended exclamation mark, and a bronze fist breaking through the
pavement with the middle finger extended.
   Supporters of the monument are casting the dispute as another
free speech issue, accusing the university of trying to stifle a
permanent reminder of its attempt to keep students and others from
engaging in political activities on campus 25 years agao.
   ``The free speech movement had effects all over the world, and
continues to inspire students everywhere,'' Selz said.
   Mayor Loni Hancock, who participated in the protests and
endorses the monument proposal, said the event brought together
students of all political persuasion, from leftists to Young
Republicans.
   ``We're a country that too often forgets our past,'' said the
mayor. ``The free speech movement was a milestone of the 1960s, the
recognition by young people of all types that they would be
participants in the governing forces around them.
   ``With what's happening today in Eastern Europe, how can we not
pause to honor that?''
   But others say the movement did not live up to the principles it
espoused.
   David Littlejohn, a journalism professor, said the movement
heralded an era of dogmatic liberalism, in which conservatives are
routinely shouted down during public speeches on campus.
   In a letter to a local newspaper, he called the monument
proposal a ``gesture of remarkable arrogance and unjustified
self-assurance. ... To welcome it to this campus would be to reject
and insult the opinions of any members of the campus who did not
regard (the movement) as Berkeley's finest hour.''

   The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inched up.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 35.42 points, or 0.09
percent, ending trading at 37,666.83. It had lost 18.74 points
Monday.
   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening Tuesday at 144.90
yen, down 0.70 yen from Monday's 145.60-yen finish. It ranged
between 144.80-145.03 yen during trading.
   Traders attributed the dollar's overnight decline mainly to the
strength of the West German mark. Confidence in the prospects for
political reform in the Soviet Union bolstered the mark, which in
turn aided the yen, they said.
   In his address Monday to the Communist Party Central Committee,
Gorbachev proposed that the party give up its monopoly on power.
   Gorbachev's grip on power is believed to be key to stability and
growth in Eastern Europe, which is expected to benefit the mark,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``Dollar-selling against mark resulted in dollar-selling against
the yen,'' Kanai said.
   Traders said the dollar's fall against the yen also reflected
concern among investors in New York that Japanese institutionsl
might keep a lower profile in the U.S. Treasury Department's
quarterly bond auction this week. Reduced Japanese purchases would
mean less demand for dollars to buy the bonds.
   But brokers in Tokyo said they expected Japanese investors to
pick up 30 percent to 35 percent the U.S. government bonds during
the three-day bidding that starts later Tuesday. That would be in
line with Japanese demand at previous auctions.
   ``Stability in overseas stock markets and expectations that
Japanese investors may bid more than previously believed in the
auction boosted the Nikkei's gains,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a
trader with Daiwa Securities Co.

   The state attorney general's
squeaky-clean image is taking a beating because of disclosures that
the gubernatorial hopeful charged the state for meals with people
who say they didn't dine with him.
   A judge, a congressman, and others listed in Steve Clark's
records of how he used his state-issued Visa card have said the
records are in error. Some others who agree they were with him say
the meals were dates, not state business.
   Clark, 42, has found his bid for governor suddenly sullied, with
some reports suggesting he ought to get out of the race, perhaps
resign.
   ``I am redoubling my efforts to win this race,'' he said last
week, but then he scrubbed two political events during the weekend
and went into seclusion to consult advisers.
   State Police and legislative auditors began combing his expense
vouchers Monday at the request of the prosecutor in Little Rock,
who helped write the state's year-old ethics law.
   Clark, a Democrat in his 12th year as attorney general, said he
is guilty of nothing more than memory lapses and keeping poor
records. He has repaid the state almost $4,000.
   Although Clark has acknowledged nearly $4,000 in mistakes,
reports by two Little Rock newspapers _ the Arkansas Gazette and
the Arkansas Democrat _ say the errors exceed $4,000 and may amount
to more than $6,000.
   In a state where the average monthly blue-collar salary is
$1,525, Clark has had to explain why he needed $562 to entertain
four political supporters at an August dinner, one of many
instances of Clark billing the state for meals at posh Little Rock
restaurants.
   He also has had to explain why many of the people listed as his
guests in records dating from 1986 say they were not with him at
the time.
   Among the phantom guests are U.S. District Judge Richard S.
Arnold of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, Rep. Tommy Robinson,
R-Ark., and state Supreme Court Justice Steele Hays.
   ``You must have the wrong Richard Arnold,'' Arnold replied when
asked about the $243.76 meal Clark said he had shared with the
judge and another man. ``I have never actually eaten dinner with
Steve Clark.''
   Rex Nelson, a spokesman for Robinson _ himself a gubernatorial
hopeful for the Republican Party, said the congressman ``has never
been to LaScala's before, with Clark or anyone else. I had to tell
him where it was.'' Clark reported spending $29 on his meal with
Robinson at the Little Rock restaurant.
   Clark, who is divorced, was on dates at two of his state-issued
Visa-financed dinners, the women told the newspapers.
   The disclosures about Clark's records have set off a wave of
jokes about the attorney on bumper stickers:
   _ ``Honk if you ate with Steve Clark.''
   _ ``Honk if you didn't eat with Steve Clark.''
   _ ``The businessman's diet _ lunch with Steve Clark. Zero
calories guaranteed.''
   A radio station offered prizes to anyone who could photograph
Clark eating last weekend. A high school student caught him at
LaScala's, and the Gazette published the picture.
   ``There is no doubt about it,'' Clark said of his records. ``It
was an honest mistake, but I made a mistake. I'm sorry and I
apologize.''
   Clark said he would sit down every 60 to 90 days with his Visa
bill and divide the personal and business expenses, using sketchy
notes in his personal calendar as a guide. For example, he said, he
may have seen Arnold at the restaurant, jotted that down, and 90
days later assumed he ate with the man.
   Clark did not have to keep the records that are getting him in
trouble. The state's seven constitutional officers, including the
governor, are not required to itemize their expenses. Clark said he
tried to keep more complete records ``as a positive thing.''
   The same two state police investigators who are looking into his
books interviewed Clark in December in connection with an alleged
bribe Clark said he was offered. The attorney general helped kill a
multimillion-dollar bond issue when he said a lobbyist offered him
$100,000 in campaign contributions to not oppose the deal.
   The lobbyist, Earl Jones, told police it was Clark who asked for
the contributions. Jones' misdemeanor trial will be held next month.

<HEAD>Texas Governor Says U.S. In No Position To Seek Foreign Collider</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Help
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements says it's premature
to be talking about getting foreign investors to build the huge
super collider in his state.
   Clements said Monday after meeting with Energy Secretary James
Watkins the Energy Department is not prepared to request foreign
help until Congress has ``completely endorsed'' the collider and
foreign countries have been assured of its total costs and design.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the collider, was adamant last
year that the department come up with a plan to share the cost of
the collider with foreign countries.
   ``We're not in a position to ask for (foreign help). Certainly
no one overseas is in a position to make a commitment for `X'
dollars until they know what `Y' cost is, and until Congress has
completely endorsed the program,'' said Clements. ``And so foreign
participation, which everybody likes to talk about, is premature to
talk about at this point,'' Clements said.
   Only India has said it is willing to contribute to the collider,
up to $50 million. President Bush is seeking a $318 million
appropriation for the collider in next year's budget. Last year he
asked for $250 million and Congress voted $225 million.
   The collider, when completed late in the decade, will allow
scientists to test theories about the fundamental nature of matter
by smashing together beams of protons at 20 times the energy now
possible.
   The original cost, estimate at $5.9 billion, will rise by $1
billion to $2 billion if the original design is maintained, a
course Watkins has indicated he favors.

   The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of

commercial relations.
   ``It's not that big, and it was something that was in the

   The New York Times reported that the $9.75 million loan, which
was signed on Friday, is to help the company pay for engineering

<TEXT>
   Actor Kevin Costner and Universal Pictures
Inc. are suing a video company, saying it is trying to profit from
the hit movie ``Field of Dreams'' by marketing a film in which
Costner played a minor role.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit says Prism Entertainment Corp.
has distributed a 1985 film, ``Chasing Dreams,'' in which Costner
played an ``extremely minor role.''
   The videocassette cover prominently displays Costner's picture
and name, according to the lawsuit filed Monday.
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring ``misrepresentations''
in the marketing of ``Chasing Dreams,'' Prism's profits from the
videocassette, and unspecified punitive damages.
   ```Chasing Dreams' was neither critically acclaimed nor
financially successful,'' wrote plaintiffs' attorney Frank Rothman.
``It was shown only in approximately 40 movie theaters in the
midwestern United States.''
   Prism President Barry Collier declined comment, saying he had
not seen the lawsuit.
   In the hit ``Field of Dreams,'' Costner plays a farmer who
builds a baseball diamond in his corn field where ghost players,
including ``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson and other members of the 1919
Chicago ``Black Sox'' come to play.
   Costner is shown on the cover of ``Chasing Dreams'' wearing a
baseball uniform but does not play a baseball player in the film,
according to the lawsuit.
   ``Field of Dreams'' has grossed $63 million since its release
last year but has yet to be released on videocassette, the lawsuit
says. Universal owns U.S. distribution rights to the film.

<HEAD>Trial Starts for Washington Men Accused of Illegal Log Exports</HEAD>

   Logs cut on federal land were sold to a
Japanese company by one of two men accused of conspiracy to
illegally export the unprocessed timber, a Forest Service
investigator testified.
   Michael Nitsch said Monday he traced several dozen logs at an
Aberdeen, Wash., shipping terminal to Joh J. Tortorelli. Tortorelli
had sold the raw logs to Nichimen American Inc., a Japanese
exporting firm, Nitsch said.
   His testimony came in the first day of the trial of Tortorelli
and Winston D. Bentley. The two are charged with orchestrating a
scheme for exporting unprocessed logs cut on national forests in
violation of a federal law designed to protect American jobs.
   Defense attorney Michael Moses said the logs purchased by
Tortorelli with Bentley's help were all thought to have been cut on
private land where the export ban does not apply.
   If convicted, the defendants each could be sentenced to 10 years
in prison and fined $20,000.
   The concern over exports has been heightened by timber shortages
blamed for layoffs and sawmill closures.
   ``There are only so many logs for our mills,'' U.S. Attorney
Pete Dunbar has said. ``If they are exporting logs illegally,
doesn't that take away from the capability of Montana mills?''
   A grand jury indictment last fall said Tortorelli arranged to
buy timber from logging companies and resell the unprocessed logs
on the lucrative export market.
   Bentley allegedly helped Tortorelli by managing a log-sorting
yard in Mead, Wash., and acted as Tortorelli's agent by
advertising, soliciting and inspecting logs.
   The indictment said both men falsely told sellers the logs would
be processed in this country.
   Also charged were truck drivers Duane Farmer and Roger Britz,
who worked for Northern Transport Inc. of Enumclaw, Wash. They were
hired by Tortorelli to haul logs from forests in Washington, Idaho
and Montana to ports in Washington, the indictment said.
   Farmer and Britz have been given immunity in exchange for their
testimony against Tortorelli and Bentley.
   Forest Service officials have said 558,515 board-feet of timber
were involved, with about two-thirds from forests in northwest
Montana.
   Northwest timber exports in 1988 were at least 4.3 billion
board-feet, up 20 percent from 1987.
   Nitsch said he received a tip in February 1988 that logs bearing
Forest Service marks were being trucked to the Aberdeen port. He
said he found about 70 such logs there, each bearing a tag
indicating they had been sold to Nichimen.
   Nitsch said he tracked about 60 of the logs to forests in
Washington and Montana and determined they had been sold by
Tortorelli to the Japanese company.
   David Faulkner, a timber sales specialist for the Forest Service
in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, testified an unprocessed log sold to
another country can bring five times as much as one sold to a U.S.
mill.
   In his opening argument, Moses said the national forest logs
bought by Tortorelli were sold and processed in this country. His
clients were not aware of any logs with Forest Service markings
being exported, he said.
   The trial before U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell is expected
to last at least a week.

   Hurricane Ofa battered several South
Pacific island groups with winds up to 115 mph before blowing out
to open water today. Relief officials said three people were killed
and hundreds left homeless.
   In a three-day run across the islands, the storm whipped up huge
seas that washed away homes and its fierce winds uprooted palm
trees and blew off roofs.
   The worst damage was reported in Western Samoa and Niue, about
450 miles to the south. The Australian Associated Press said three
people were killed in Western Samoa, which was declared a disaster
area by its government.
   ``People in Western Samoa, like other places of the South
Pacific, live a traditional lifestyle under thatched roofs. So when
they get a big blow, they get a lot of damage,'' said an Australian
official involved in the emergency operation.
   ``We have reports of severe damage, but our information so far
is that ... there is little loss of life,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official in Canberra, the Australian capital.
   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Foreign Ministry official reported major damage in Western
Samoa, where 170,000 people live on the islands about 1,700 miles
northeast of New Zealand.
   There were sketchy reports of damage and injuries in the island
nations of Niue, Tuvalu, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna, and Tokelau.
   Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Tonga as well as
Wallis and Futuna had been hit badly.
   In American Samoa, at least two thirds of the U.S. territory's
38,000 residents were without water because a power outage caused
the storm.
   Niue, a coral atoll nation of about 4,000 people about 450 miles
south of Western Samoa, began cleaning up today.
   The storm wrecked the island's hospital and forced the
evacuation of 50 patients. Homes were damaged and palm trees
uprooted while the storm whipped up huge seas, the New Zealand
Press Association reported.
   No deaths were reported there, but a fisherman was injured when
his boat smashed onto rocks in heavy seas.
   Niue's communications with the outside world were ruptured for
18 hours.
   A few homes in Alofi, the capital, were ``annihilated'' by
savage seas, acting New Zealand representive in Niue, Peter
Hassell, told the New Zealand Press Association. He said a hotel
was damaged beyond repair.
   Hassell said the capital was still without water and had only
limited electricity.
   Australia dispatched a military C-130 Hercules transport plane
with emergency supplies to Western Samoa. The New Zealand
Government also promised relief supplies.

<HEAD>Feinstein, Young, Launch Gubernatorial Bids; Rizzo Seeks Mayoralty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERB LASH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former mayors Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco and Andrew Young
of Atlanta launched bids for governor of their states, and Frank L.
Rizzo said he would try a third time to become a three-term mayor
of Philadelphia.
   Also Monday, Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., said he was seeking a third
term and four-term Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut said he was
accepting the pleas of Republican leaders to run for secretary of
state.
   Feinstein and Young will seek the governorships on the
Democratic tickets in races that would be a first in their states
for women and blacks if they are elected.
   The two pro-business politicians said they oppose raising taxes
and both will campaign as pro-choice candidates, but from there
their styles differ.
   Feinstein, 56, called her bid a historic step for women. She is
an underdog in polls and fund-raising to Democratic state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in
California's June 5 primary. The incumbent, Republican George
Deukmejian, is not seeking re-election this fall.
   Young, 57, has avoided appeals based on race, and continued that
strategy in his first official campaign speech. He spoke of a
coalition campaign with ``young and old, rural and suburban folks.''
   The former ambassador to the United Nations who stepped down as
Atlanta's mayor last month after eight years in office leads a pack
of five Democrats in a poll conducted by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution last fall.
   Georgia's primary is July 17 and if no candidate receives 50
percent of the vote there will be a runoff Aug. 7 for the November
election.
   Young sounded campaign themes of progress and education and
strove to reassure people outside Atlanta about his ideas and his
qualifications. He was a key player in the civil-rights movement
and represented Atlanta in Congress from 1973-77.
   ``I want you to get to know me,'' he said before embarking on a
four-day road tour of 17 Georgia cities. ``I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.''
   Feinstein launched her candidacy in San Francisco, Los Angeles
and Sacramento.
   At a rally in San Francisco, Feinstein drew the loudest applause
when she talked of abortion and the fact she is the first woman to
mount a major campaign for governor in California.
   ``This is a big moment for me, and an historic one for women,''
she said. ``Much thought and deliberation preceded this decision. I
am a non-incumbent in a race against two entrenched statewide
figures _ a woman in a field of men.''
   And on the abortion issue, Feinstein said:
   ``It's true men can protect women's rights, but it's also true
the experiences of men and women are different experiences. I very
strongly believe ... with a woman who is governor, I know if she
believes in choice, she's not going to have anything to do with any
erosion of that basic optional right.''
   Young also addressed abortion and said he would push for a state
lottery, prmosing ``leadership that will protect a woman's right to
choose, and protect your right to vote for a lottery if you so
choose.''
   Rizzo, who served as Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 as a
Democrat, lost his latest effort to regain City Hall on the
Republican ballot in 1987 when Mayor W. Wilson Goode was re-elected
by 18,000 votes.
   But Rizzo, a former beat cop and police commissioner, said:
``This time they can't beat me. After Wilson Goode in this town, I
even get the liberals now.''
   When Rizzo squared off against Goode for the second time in
1987, voter turnout was more than 70 percent. Politicians viewed
the high turnout, especially in predominantly black wards, as
voting against Rizzo, rather than for Goode, whose popularity
suffered after the city's violent confrontation with the radical
group MOVE in 1985.
   The election is in 1991.
   In Indiana, Hudnut, 57, will likely face Democratic incumbent
Joseph H. Hogsett. Hogsett, 33, was appointed after Evan Bayh left
that office to become governor.

   The state's first female attorney general
went on the offensive and sued the federal government over its
order that Virginia Military Institute accept women.
   State Attorney General Mary Sue Terry filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Roanoke on Monday less than an hour after the
institute voted to uphold its men-only admission policy.
   The lawsuit asks the court to declare the policy constitutional
at the 150-year-old tax-supported school in Lexington.
   Terry named U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the
Justice Department as defendants in the lawsuit, which came a week
after the department threatened to sue the state over the
admissions policy.
   ``This action is filed in order to prevent federal encroachment
seeking to enforce unnecessary conformity in the state-supported
system of higher education in Virginia,'' the lawsuit said.
   The Justice Department's finding ``was made without any inquiry
into the state interest served by VMI and without any visit to VMI
to review first-hand its program of instruction,'' the lawsuit
said. ``Women are not denied equal educational opportunity by VMI's
admission's policy.''
   Terry said women who want a military-school education can enroll
in the ROTC program at Virginia Tech, another state-supported
university.
   ``The state-supported system of higher education in Virginia is
richly diverse, consisting of both public and private
institutions,'' the lawsuit said.
   After a nearly two-hour closed meeting, VMI's board unanimously
approved a resolution affirming the men-only admissions policy at
the 1,250-student school.
   ``We do not believe that VMI's admissions policy violates any
provision of law, including the constitutions of Virginia and the
United States,'' the resolution said. ``We believe that VMI's
academic mission contributes to the diversity and balance of the
Virginia system of higher education.''
   The Justice Department said VMI's admissions policy violates the
14th Amendment to the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of
1964. It set a Feb. 20 deadline for the state to respond with a
plan for ending the single-sex policy or face a lawsuit.
   The department will stand by its original plan to sue if the
state does not change its mind, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, a
Justice spokeswoman.
   ``We're sticking by our case because we do feel very
confident,'' she said.
   The department investigation was prompted by a complaint from a
northern Virginia teen-age girl who had been told she could not
apply to the school.
   Former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles told the VMI board last May that
the admissions policy was illegal. He included $160,000 in his
proposed 1990-92 state budget to provide barracks for women at
institute.
   His successor, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, has declined to take a
position.
   A bill to force VMI to admit women will come before the Senate
Committee on Education and Health on Thursday. But the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Emilie F. Miller said she has little indication of
much support for the measure.
   ``Most people are tiptoeing around it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Council Votes Against Sale of Crime Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Council rejected a proposal to sell
hundreds of guns confiscated in crimes since 1977 and to use the
proceeds to buy new weapons for the police department.
   ``They tried all kinds of public tricks to get it passed, but it
didn't work out, '' said City Council President Ray Denczak.
   Monday's 7-5 vote came despite an amendment that would have
ordered about 350 small, easily concealable ``Saturday Night
specials'' destroyed because of questions about the legality of
selling them.
   Some council members worried that the guns might be used again
to commit crimes.
   An affirmative vote would have authorized the guns' sale to the
highest-bidding licensed gun dealer.
   The city tried to sell the guns last year but decided against it
when the highest bidder offered only $31,000 for the lot _ about
half its estimated worth.
   The police department has 1,048 confiscated guns in its storage
room.

<HEAD>Feds Move to Halt U.S. Chemicals Destined for South American Drug
Labs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug officials are trying to block
exports of certain chemicals to 52 Latin American companies because
the solvents are being used to process cocaine, a newspaper
reported today.
   The solvents include methyl ethyl ketone, manufactured primarily
by Exxon Corp. and Shell Oil Co., the Los Angeles Times reported,
citing unidentified sources.
   The move was authorized under new legislation and targets about
one in five of the companies that were regular importers of U.S.
industrial solvents, the newspaper said.
   Disclosures indicating the extensive role of U.S.-originated
chemicals in South American cocaine production were scheduled to be
revealed today in a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing looking into
such chemical exports, the Times said.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration's action could force South
American companies to turn to European suppliers.
   U.S. manufacturers argue they double check to make certain their
international customers have legitimate uses for the solvents, but
a senior official with the Chemical Manufacturers Association said
U.S. exports often are diverted to cocaine producers.
   ``It can happen that products are sold to a customer who seems
legitimate and that the product then is diverted into illegal drug
marketing,'' R. Garrity Baker, the association's director of
international activities, said Monday.
   The 52 companies were among 288 described as ``regular
customers'' for U.S. exports. U.S. officials in Bogota, Colombia,
said many of the businesses were fronts for Colombian drug cartels.
   Regular customer status allows Latin American companies to
receive U.S. shipments with less documentation. Removing the status
effectively bars them from receiving exported solvents, DEA
officials told congressional investigators.
   The DEA refused to identify the companies. The date of the
customer status reclassification was not reported. None of the U.S.
exporters affected have challenged the ban.
   The Times reported earlier that 90 percent of the 13 million
gallons of methyl ethyl ketone exported to Colombia last year was
believed to have been used in cocaine laboratories.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week introduced legislation to
outlaw export of the chemical. Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev.,
responsible for the subcommittee hearing probing the exports, said
he will urge the President Bush to bring up the chemical export
issue during his drug summit in Colombia.
   ``This is a serious problem, and there is more that (the United
States) can do,'' Bryan said.

<HEAD>Death Warrant Signed Ordering April 3rd Execution of Harris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge signed a death warrant against double
murderer Robert Alton Harris for what could be California's first
execution in 23 years.
   Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez on Monday ordered the
execution for April 3 for the 1978 abduction and murders of two
teen-age boys.
   ``We're really up against the gun now,'' said Michael McCabe, an
attorney for Harris, 37. ``There's no question that we've been up
and down both the state and federal habeas corpus (appeal) system
more than anyone else.''
   Harris, one of 273 inmates on San Quentin's death row, was
convicted in the 1978 shootings of Michael Baker and John Mayeski,
both 16. According to testimony, Harris abducted the boys as they
sat in their car at a drive-in restaurant, drove them to a remote
area, shot them and then laughed about it as he munched on their
unfinished lunch.
   Last week, Rodriguez denied a defense request to delay setting
an execution date.
   Three previous dates, the last set for 1982, were dissolved
during appeals. Charles Sevilla, another defense attorney, said a
request for a stay of the latest date would be filed soon with the
California Supreme Court.
   In its fourth consideration of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court
last month cleared the way for Harris' execution when it refused to
hear his appeal.
   Sevilla said Harris is aware time may be running out.
   ``He's understandably frightened of this process,'' Sevilla
said. ``But if he has to go, as he's said, he will go to the best
of his ability with dignity. It's very difficult when you're about
to be killed to go out with dignity, but he's going to try to do
that.''
   The last person executed in California was convicted police
killer Aaron Mitchell, who died in San Quentin's gas chamber in
1967.
   Sevilla said the most appropriate sentence for Harris would be
life in prison without parole.
   ``An emotional barrier will be broken if there is an execution
which, I think, will psychologically open the floodgates to many
more to come, and there are about 250 people on death row, so a lot
rides on this case,'' Sevilla said.
   ``I say killing an individual is a very cruel event. It was a
cruel event for which Mr. Harris was convicted, and the state is
now going to repeat that event.''
   Deputy Attorney General Louis Hanoian, who has opposed Harris'
appeals for the state, disputed Sevilla's comparison.
   ``The cruel act was the murder of two young boys,'' Hanoian
said. ``They received no trial, no appeal, no mercy. Mr. Harris has
had 11 years of due process since he committed these brutal murders
and the state can take away his life having given him due process.''
   In a telephone interview from prison, Harris told radio station
KFMB last week that the killings are ``not something I have
relished over.
   ``I'm very tore up about this. Not only did they die on that
day. I did, too.''
   The father of victim Michael Baker, police Detective Steve
Baker, said he doesn't believe Harris' expressions of remorse.
   ``He's lying through his teeth,'' said Baker, who added he plans
to witness Harris' execution. ``I'm sure he regrets being caught,
but that's about as far as it goes.''
   Harris' latest appeal to the state Supreme Court includes claims
that the death penalty is no longer appropriate because he has
reformed while in prison and because he has been under the threat
of execution for so many years that to carry it out now would be
cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``We are not attempting to simply delay the inevitable. We feel
that there are strong constitutional issues that have to be
resolved,'' McCabe said.
   The state has until Feb. 16 to file its response, and the
defense then has 30 days from then to file its rebuttal.

   Contributions of clothes and money
streamed in for a woman whose five children were among six victims
of a fiery car crash.
   When the accident occurred Sunday, Marcella England and her
boyfriend, Howard Bouchard, both 38, were moving with the children
from New York state to Texas, where Ms. England has another
daughter.
   ``I just felt like it was a need for someone passing through the
area who didn't have any family and didn't know anyone,'' said Joe
Wright, a Southwestern Bell employee who helped raise more than
$400 for the couple among active and retired phone company workers.
   The single-vehicle accident occurred on an icy bridge on
Interstate 44 near Mount Vernon in southwestern Missouri.
   Bouchard pulled Ms. England from the wreckage. They turned back
to try to save the children, but saw only the flames engulfing the
station wagon.
   The dead included Ms. Englund's daughters Edna, 16, Clara, 14,
Ella, 12, and Virginia, and their 10-year-old brother, Virgil. Also
killed was Edna's fiance, Arthur Brown, 20.
   Ms. England has one child left _ 19-year-old Tammy, who lives in
Denton, Texas.
   ``I wanted to scream and holler,'' Ms. England said Monday
night. ``I admit, I cussed at God. But I guess he wanted them for
some reason.''
   She and Bouchard are staying this week at the Ronald McDonald
House of the Ozarks. The house, normally a home for parents of sick
children, was pressed into service because the couple had nowhere
to go, and no money for bus tickets to northern Texas.
   Others helping include Melody Esterline, who was working in the
St. John's pharmacy Sunday when she heard about the accident. Soon
after, she was collecting clothes for the two survivors.
   ``She decided she needed to do something for this family because
they were from out of town and had no local ties,'' said Barbara
Wright, a co-worker and Joe Wright's wife.
   The couple's most pressing need is money, said Bonnie
Kellen-Engle, executive director of the Ronald McDonald House.
   Ms. England said she is grateful. The generosity of strangers
won't bring back her children, but they live in her memories.
   She says Edna was stubborn. She called Clara her veterinarian.
Ella was a joker and Virginia had dreams of being a doctor. Virgil,
the only boy, was spoiled, but tough.
   She spoke calmly of her dead children.
   ``I have to make sure the children are finally taken care of,''
she said. ``There's a job that has to be done _ funeral
arrangements in Texas.''
   She said she and Bouchard plan to live in Texas.
   ``I'm going to stay with my children,'' she said. ``I want to be
close to them. They're home.''

   The Bush administration today
embraced as a ``pretty good'' idea a proposal by West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher for reunification with East
Germany.
   A senior U.S. official traveling with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said the French government also seemed taken with
Genscher's plan to keep Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, but without moving western troops into what is now
East Germany.
   Genscher's proposal also would permit the Soviet Union to keep
forces in what is now East Germany, where some 390,000 are now
based. How long they might remain is not clear.
   Baker discussed the fast-moving German situation with French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas at a refueling stop in Shannon,
Ireland, and then flew to Prague for talks with leaders of
Czechoslovakia's ``velvet revolution'' from hard-line communism
toward democracy.
   The U.S. official, who spoke with reporters on condition that
his name not be used, said, ``We think that proposal _ in terms of
not having NATO forces move farther east _ is a pretty good one.''
   The official said one of the virtues of Genscher's plan is that
it would maintain Germany in NATO _ a condition set down by Baker
on reunification. ``We think that is a very positive
contribution,'' the official said.
   Asked about Dumas' appraisal of the plan, the official said:
``He didn't specifically address that issue, but I'd say from the
tone of it, it was positive. He continues to believe NATO has a
very positive role'' in Germany.
   The support given Genscher's approach was noteworthy because,
until now, the Bush administration had been noncommittal about the
future of the two Germanies. Baker has stressed only the importance
of a NATO role and a peaceful evolution.
   The official acknowledged that developments were moving so
rapidly that after East Germany holds national elections next month
``there is an extraordinarily high probability'' that the Soviet
ally will be pressing for reunification with West Germany.
   ``You can expect a very quick process dealing with economic,
political and legal aspects between the two German states,'' he
said.
   In Prague, Baker arranged meetings with President Vaclav Havel,
the dissident playwright chosen leader of the Central European
country in the collapse last December of the Communist Party, and
with Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek and leaders of the Civic Forum.
   He also scheduled a speech Wednesday morning at Charles
University before flying on to Moscow to begin four days of talks.
   Although the Bush administration was withholding an appraisal of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call in Moscow for the
Communist Party to release its iron grip on the Soviet Union, U.S.
officials subtly voiced support for support for ``political
pluralism,'' the likely result if the Communist Party's Central
Committee follows through on Gorbachev's initiative.
   Gorbachev appeared to soften his opposition to German
reunification last week and Baker is certain to probe the issue
with him and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   France, vanquished twice this century by German military might,
is observing with keen interest the quickening course taken toward
unification by West German and East German leaders.
   Baker's 27-hour visit to Prague, meanwhile, is designed to show
U.S. support for the smooth transition from a hard-line Communist
state to an emerging democracy.
   Havel is demanding the withdrawal of the estimated 75,000 Soviet
troops in Czechoslovakia as part of a complex disarmament scheme
that also might require even deeper cuts in American forces in
Central Europe than President Bush proposed last week.
   Bush would set a ceiling of 195,000 on U.S. and Soviet forces in
the area.
   His national security assistant, Brent Scowcroft, said over the
weekend that was the bottom line figure. But Havel's plan could put
pressure on both the United States and the Soviet Union to go
further.
   Baker, meanwhile, is ready of offer Czechoslovakia economic
support, beginning with a lowering of U.S. trade barriers. Last
month, Prague asked for readmittance to the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund after a 35-year absence. But according
to government officials, it is more in need of expert advice than
credits.
   In his speech Wednesday, Baker is expected to register U.S.
support for Gorbachev's proposal for a 35-nation summit meeting
later this year.
   The idea is to reduce East-West tensions even further. Baker is
likely to stress a need also for more action on human rights by the
Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Former Slovak Politburo Member Hangs Himself</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former high-ranking Communist
official ousted during the November revolution for his part in
crushing Czechoslovakia's 1968 reforms has committed suicide, the
state news agency said today.
   The body of Viliam Salgovic, 70, was found by his wife hanging
in the laundry room of his home in the Slovak capital Bratislava
late Monday, CTK said. A preliminary investigation suggested
Salgovic acted alone, it added.
   Salgovic, a former member of Slovakia's Communist party
Politburo, was the first senior member of the leadership that
crushed reform after 1968 known to have committed suicide following
last fall's peaceful revolution.
   At least two police officers have killed themselves since
November, while former Prague Communist party boss Antonin Kapek
was hospitalized with severe injuries after trying to shoot himself
last month.
   Salgovic, a longtime member of senior Communist ranks, served as
deputy interior minister during the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms
of Alexander Dubcek. In this post, he is thought to have controlled
the State Security forces and served as Czechoslovakia's link to
the Soviet KGB secret police.
   Zdenek Mlynar, a member of Dubcek's leadership who now lives in
Austria, charged in his memoirs of the 1968 invasion that Salgovic
served as a virtual Soviet agent.
   After the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed Dubcek's
policies, Salgovic assumed a series of high offices in Slovakia,
becoming a member of the Politburo in that republic and chairman of
its parliament.
   Like all the other senior figures associated with the post-1968
crackdown, Salgovic lost those posts in the November revolt, which
ended the Communists' 41-year monopoly on power and installed a
coalition government that pledged to organize free elections.

   After months of combing want ads and
finding he was too old or too qualified for academic positions,
Romanian defector Paul Petrescu says he was glad to find work as
groundskeeper at a country inn.
   The job, which sometimes means shoveling snow and sweeping
halls, might seem like a comedown for a man with two doctorates,
five languages and an authoritative knowledge of Romanian folk art.
   But the 69-year-old defector is happy to have the work.
   ``It is very healthy exercise,'' said Petrescu, who has
doctorates in sociology and political science from the University
of Bucharest but now calls himself dean of the eight-man grounds
crew. ``I was a soccer player in my time. I feel like I'm on a
sports team. We are friends.''
   And despite the revolution in his homeland, he plans to stay.
   Petrescu and his wife, Juliana, decided to try to leave Romania
three years ago. The plan was for Petrescu to leave first,
establish himself in the West and then send for his wife and son.
   When he was allowed to join a lecture tour in Switzerland,
Petrescu took the opportunity to slip into the West German embassy
and was granted a visa through his contacts in that country. But
the West German government was reluctant to issue visas for
Petrescu's family, so 11 months ago he applied for political asylum
in the United States.
   He came to Stockbridge in the Berkshire hills by way of his
friendship with local resident John C. ffrench, who met Petrescu 32
years ago at a traveling Romanian folk art exhibit in India.
   Petrescu got his job at the Red Lion Inn by answering a
newspaper ad last summer, said Betsy Holtzinger, inn general
manager.
   ``He's so intelligent and gifted and yet he is willing to do
this work,'' she said. Petrescu does odd jobs, such as shoveling
snow and raking leaves in season, and works as a gardener for
owners John and Jane Fitzpatrick, Holtzinger said.
   Petrescu's wife and 20-year-old son have been granted permission
to enter the United States and he took a month off at the beginning
of this year to arrange for their travel. They are expected to join
him soon.
   Petrescu said he was shocked at the speed with which revolution
swept Eastern Europe. In Romania, people took to the streets in
December in a fight that led to the execution of dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu and his wife.
   ``That was the hope only,'' he said. ``We hoped this for so long
time.''
   He said that although he has always opposed the death penalty,
he did not think the deaths of the Ceausescus were too hasty.
   ``For 25 years they destroyed Romania, economically and also
biologically. The genocide they accuse him of is real. It is not a
political metaphor.''
   Petrescu doesn't have any immediate plans to return to Romania,
saying he would rather stay here and find a way to use his
education and knowledge.
   At the Romanian Folk Art Museum in Evanston, Ill., museum
president Rodica Perciali was delighted to hear of Petrescu's
whereabouts, although she said it could be difficult for him to
find an outlet for his specialized knowledge.
   ``His books are some of the most important to Romanian
culture,'' she said.
   Petrescu said he recently received good news about his writings,
which had been banished after he left the country.
   ``My son called me. He said, `I was just in the bookstore and
your books are back on the shelves,''' Petrescu said.

   A lawmaker intends to show Philip Morris
Inc. just what a long way consumers have come by sending the
cigarette maker's datebooks to classrooms for a lesson in the
politics of persuasion.
   The calendars _ built around the Virginia Slims theme: ``You've
come a long way, baby'' _ feature pictures of fashionably and
scantily clothed women with cigarettes.
   Two years ago, state Rep. Anne Seibert collected the calendars
and returned them to the company on the grounds they were sexist
and promoted a deadly habit.
   A letter sent by Seibert and 65 other lawmakers calls the books
``demeaning to women, their history and their accomplishments,''
and inappropriate mementos for lawmakers grappling with issues like
health care and medical costs.
   However, Seibert said recently, the materials could inform
students about sexism in advertising and about cancer risks with
big profit motives behind them.
   Teacher Carol Barbagallo said she plans to use the datebook to
teach Rutland Town Elementary School fifth-graders about drug and
alcohol abuse.
   ``We're looking for healthy children, and a healthy future for
children,'' she said.
   Part of the goal in Barbagallo's 20-lesson program is to look at
how advertisers sell the public on a product. The children will
clip and discuss ads from popular magazines and look at materials
such as the Virginia Slims datebook.
   ``I call it tobacco humor,'' said Seibert, a Democrat. ``Their
theme is `You've come a long way baby,' but they only picture women
smoking in various fashion outfits.''
   The calendars list what Virginia Slims considers important dates
in women's history _ including Aug. 26, 1920, the day women won the
right to vote, and the day in 1968 when Virginia Slims were
introduced.
   Seibert said that approach belittles the accomplishment of the
women's suffrage movement.
   A telephone call to Enud Houminer, president of Philip Morris'
tobacco division in New York, was not returned.
   Philip Morris also has sent lawmakers copies of the Bill of
Rights, complete with the company name at the bottom.
   Seibert said these, too, would be sent to Vermont schools, after
removal of the ``commercial endorsement (that) defaces the replica
of this historic document.''

   The government has ordered two
British journalists covering the ban-shattering tour of an English
cricket team to leave the country because it disapproves of their
reports.
   Paul Weaver of the newspaper Today and Gareth Furby of
Independent Radio News were admitted to South Africa on temporary
permits.
   Home Affairs Minister Gene Louw said both journalists had sent
reports ``intended to damage South Africa's image.'' He said
Weaver's reports were ``emotionally laden and exaggerated,'' and
called Furby's dispatches ``distorted.''
   Weaver was given a work permit to cover the visit of the English
cricket team touring the country in defiance of an international
sports boycott.
   Louw said that Furby had entered to country under false
pretenses, saying he had come to visit friends when he was actually
sending out reports on the cricket tour and other events.
   He said Weaver had filed a report which appeared to be a first
person account of police action against anti-cricket tour
demonstrators at the Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg when the
reporter had ``arrived at the scene two hours after the incidents
on which he had reported so recklessly.''

<HEAD>New Sex Allegations Against Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second man alleges he had sex with the Roman
Catholic priest who founded Covenant House, the nation's largest
runaway shelter.
   Darryl J. Bassile, 31, of Ithaca, claimed the encounters
occurred after he had sought refuge as a teen-ager at Covenant
House, The New York Times reported today.
   Roman Catholic church officials are investigating the new
charges, the Times said.
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter denied Bassile's allegations, calling him
a ``sick kid.''
   On Monday, the shelter conceded that it provided a dead boy's
indentity to a former male prostitute who was the first runaway to
allege he had sex with the Franciscan priest.
   Bassile said that in April 1973, when he was 14, he met Ritter
after entering a Covenant House branch in Greenwich Village.
   He said he visited Ritter's apartment to discuss his anguished
past and that on his second visit Ritter made sexual overtures. On
the third visit, Ritter fondled him and they engaged in a sexual
act, Bassile said. He said they had sex several times after that.
   Ritter said he remembered meeting Bassile briefly, and recalled
only one conversation with him in which the teen-ager asked the
priest to marry him to a man in a wheelchair.
   The priest also has denied allegations brought by former
prostitute Kevin Kite, who has said Ritter gave him money, housing
and gifts in exchange for sex. Kite's father has described his son
as an emotionally troubled liar.
   Prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating whether
Covenant House funds were used for Ritter's personal benefit.
   The organization, founded by Ritter in 1968, manages 17 shelters
with more than 2,000 beds in the United States, Canada and Latin
America, serving about 25,000 young people annually, making it the
nation's largest runaway shelter. Its $85 million annual budget
comes mainly from private donations.
   More questions have arisen with the disclosure shelter officials
provided Kite with papers for a new identity.
   On Monday, the shelter confirmed that the identity was that of a
dead 10-year-old boy. Officials refused to say how they got copies
of the child's birth records.
   Covenant House said it had meant no harm to the parents of the
dead child, Timothy Warner of Jamestown, who said they learned from
a reporter about the use of their child's identity.
   ``The poor kid's dead. He suffered so. I wish he was still here.
And here's somebody going around using his name,'' said the boy's
mother, Betty Anne Warner. ``I don't think it's fair.''
   Ritter has said he tried to help Kite get off the streets. In
December, Ritter said: ``I ... even gave him the name of Timothy
Warner on a new birth certificate so that he could get his life
started again.''
   Mrs. Warner said she and her husband learned of the matter only
last week. She said they contacted the FBI and have been
interviewed by a New York City prosecutor.
   Timothy Warner died of leukemia in 1980. It was unclear how
Covenant House may have obtained copies of his birth record and
baptismal certificate.
   Only a minor's parents, their lawyer or someone with a proven
legal interest can legally obtain birth certificate copies, state
Health Department officials said. Mrs. Warner said she has the
originals.
   Stanley Arkin, Ritter's lawyer, said it would be legal to use
such records as long as it was not for illegal purposes.

   Mild weather continued in the upper Midwest today, while rain
and snow fell on the Northwest.
   A cold front reached across northwestern Montana and California
north of San Francisco with clouds, gusty winds and precipitation.
Rain turned to snow in the higher altitudes.
   A low pressure system near the New Mexico-Texas border was
expected to move northeast across the southern Plains by tonight,
bringing rain or snow to Kansas, Missouri and southeastern Nebraska
and Iowa.
   The western Gulf states looked for scattered showers today. Rain
was due in the Ohio Valley and central Appalachinas tonight, with
snow possible in West Virginia's mountains by Wednesday morning.
   On Monday, as much as 10 inches of snow fell in Washington's
Cascade Mountains. Up to another foot may fall by today in the
Cascades and Olympics.
   Forecasts call for skies in the Pacific Northwest to clear by
Wednesday and for temperatures to sink about 20 degrees below
normal.
   Snow advisories were in effect today for Oregon's mountains and
interior southwest.
   Northern New England also braced for more snow.
   The lowest temperature in Alaska _ now in its 10th consecutive
day of bitter cold, laced with ice and fog _ was 55 below at Fort
Yukon.
   The northern Plains states of Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa,
Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska basked in their warmest January since
regional record-keeping began in 1931.
   Three Minnesota cities enjoyed record highs for the date Monday:
Duluth hit 43 degrees; St. Cloud 45 and Minneapolis-St. Paul 47.

<HEAD>Former Wyoming Governor Dead at 71</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Ed Herschler, a Democrat who
won a record three terms in the staunchly Republican state, has
died at the age of 71.
   Herschler died Monday at Laramie County Memorial Hospital after
an extended bout with cancer, according to hospital spokesman Dave
Hall.
   Herschler was Wyoming's only three-term governor. A poll in
1986, his last year in office, showed he was the state's most
popular politician.
   In 1986, the Democrats had hoped to capitalize on his popularity
by having him seek a fourth term or challenge Republican U.S. Sen.
Malcolm Wallop in 1988. But Herschler declined the offers, saying
the party needed new blood.
   Herschler entered state politics in 1961 when he won a term in
the House of Representatives after eight years as a county
prosecutor. In 1970, Herschler lost his House seat, but returned to
claim a surprising victory for governor four years later.
   Herschler's first term as governor coincided with the mineral
industry's rapid growth, which was spurred by world oil prices.
   He was credited with pushing through the Republican-controlled
Legislature the creation of the Wyoming Community Development
Authority.
   During his second term, Herschler supported legislation
establishing the framework for the state's water development
program and expressed growing concern over federal intervention in
state affairs.
   Herschler garnered nearly half the Republican votes cast in the
1982 gubernatorial election to defeat former Wyoming House Speaker
Warren Morton and win his unprecedented third term.
   But he battled financial troubles during his last term, as the
18,500-acre Yellowstone Ranch, which he co-owned, failed and forced
him to file for bankruptcy in September 1985.
   In his bankruptcy petition, the former governor listed debts
totaling $5.9 million.

<HEAD>Icahn Seeks $80 Million in Concessions from TWA Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. chairman Carl Icahn
says he will buy new jetliners and expand the carrier's operations
if TWA pilots agree to $80 million in wage concessions, according
to a published report.
   Icahn said he needed the concessions because TWA lost more than
$200 million in 1989, the St. Louis Sun reported in today's
editions. With the lower pilot pay and other savings, he said the
airline could break even in 1990.
   Icahn said in an interview that if the pilots reject the
concessions, he will step up plans to sell more of the airline's
assets, including marginally profitable routes and some aircraft.
   Icahn has asked the airline's 3,500 pilots to take a 10 percent
wage cut, give up vacation days and make concessions in their
retirement benefits _ all worth about $80 million.
   The request comes three years after the pilots gave up
concessions that totaled $500 million. Union officials said Monday
they weren't interested in more pay cuts.
   ``We've given up concessions twice, and both times, he's
promised to grow the airline,'' said William Compton, chairman of
the negotiating committee for TWA's chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``He didn't live up to his promise in 1986, so we have
a hard time believing he's going to live up to his promise'' this
time.
   With more concessions, Icahn said, his long-range plans for the
airline would include adding another major hub operation in
addition to St. Louis, as well as acquiring another major airline.
   ``The fate of the airline, whether it grows or shrinks, is in
the pilots' hands,'' Icahn said. ``We can shrink the airline or
shrink the costs.''
   Shrinking the costs will allow TWA to follow through on a plan
to acquire up to 100 narrow-body jetliners, Icahn said.
   Airline analysts have said that one of the keys to TWA's
long-term survival is new aircraft. The airline flies the nation's
oldest fleet of jets _ the average age is 14.7 years _ and needs to
re-invest in new equipment to attract passengers and decrease
operating costs, analysts said.

   A U.S. Air Force A-10 ground attack plane crashed
in Wales today, one day after a USAF bomber crashed into the sea
off the east coast, police said.
   West Mercia Police said wreckage was found at Capel-y-ffin in
the Black Mountains, about 8 miles south of Hay-on-Wye on the
English border.
   Donald Dick of the 3rd Air Force Headquarters said a search
involving helicopters and a mountain rescue team continued for the
pilot, the lone crew member.
   USAF Capt. Raymond Martell said the A-10 was stationed at Royal
Air Force base Alconbury, 20 miles northwest of the university town
of Cambridge. He said it was reported missing after it lost radio
contact.
   The plane is designed to support troops by attacking enemy tanks
and other ground targets. It is highly maneuverable at low speeds
and low altitude and can carry a large amount of bombs and
ammunition.
   On Monday, an F-111 bomber with two USAF members crashed over a
sea firing range known as Wainfleet during a routine training
mission, the Defense Ministry said.
   The air force said the pilot, Capt. Clifford W. Massengill, 30,
Edenton, N.C. was killed, and his body had been recovered. Missing
and presumed dead is 1st Lt. Thomas G. Dorsett, 26, of Pensacola,
Fla., the air force said.
   The coast guard at Great Yarmouth today that an air-sea search
resumed this morning.
   ``The aircraft crashed on sand banks in The Wash and a lot of
debris has been found,'' a coast guard spokesman said Monday night.
The Wash is a shallow bay of the North Sea.
   The bomber was based at Upper Heyford, near Oxford, 50 miles
northwest of London.
   Upper Heyford is one of two British bases for 84 American
bombers, which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
   The F-111s flew from their British bases to mount a 1986
American bombing raid on Libya.

<HEAD>Free Enterprise Legalized in Romania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The interim government is permitting
more free enterprise than ever allowed in 45 years of Communist
rule under a new decree, but it is for now keeping large
enterprises in the hands of the state.
   ``The development of free initiative ... is meant to improve and
develop and vary products and services under free-market
circumstances,'' said the National Salvation Front.
   The front's 11-member executive bureau has been ruling Romania
since the bloody December revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The decree signed Monday by interim President Ion Iliescu, read
on state-run television, will allow privately-owned businesses with
up to 20 employees. The law, which takes effect immediately, is
aimed at improving the living standards of Romania's population of
23 million by offering a wider assortment of goods and services.
   In another move to improve living standards, the front announced
that the lowest level of pensions for peasants would be increased.
The monthly pension of $28 will be doubled, but is still far below
the average national monthly salary of $336.
   During the 24-year Ceausescu dictatorship, basic foods and other
commodities became a scarcity, especially in the last eight years
when Ceausescu became determined to pay off Romania's $11 billion
foreign debt.
   Ceausescu allowed a very small number of individual businesses
to operate, with a maximum of two or three employees. In recent
years, however, many shoemakers and tailors had to close because of
high state taxes and chronic shortages of material.
   The interim leadership made clear that it plans to keep
Romania's large enterprises _ including steelworks, shipyards and
food processing plants _ state-owned at least until the May 20
elections decide who will govern the country.

   The Archdiocese of Washington says it will
excommunicate any Catholics who join Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.'s
breakaway African-American Catholic Congregation.
   The archdiocese announced Monday that Stallings and his
followers had been excommunicated over Stallings' public break from
the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``By his public declaration that he has separated himself from
the church and by his renunciation of church teaching, Father
Stallings has excommunicated himself,'' the archdiocese said in a
statement by Vicar General William Kane.
   ``Any Catholic who would knowingly and willingly renounce his or
her Catholic faith to become a full and active member of Father
Stallings's congregation would also incur automatic
excommunication,'' the statement said.
   Excommunication, which excludes a person from the sacraments and
rights of the church, is the Roman Catholic Church's most powerful
weapon against defiant members. The statement said members of
Stallings' congregation could resume participation in the Catholic
Church only if they go to confession and do penance.
   Stallings, a dissident black priest, publicly criticized the
church's treatment of blacks last summer when he formed his Imani
Temple, an independent congregation. He announced his decision to
break all ties with the Vatican last week.
   On Sunday, Stallings said his congregation of several hundred
followers would observe new church laws. Women would be allowed to
be ordained as priests, he said, and his congregation will allow
the practice of birth control and abortion.
   In addition, he said he would permit ``optional celibacy, which
means our priests will be able to decide whether or not they want
to marry.''
   Stallings will respond to the archdiocese's action in a
television interview Tuesday night, said William Marshall, his
spokesman. Stallings told The Washington Post last week,
``Suspension and excommunication ... are all political tactics used
by the powerful ... to further enslave and oppress the oppressed.
Those terms have no meaning or significance to me whatsoever. ... I
cannot be cut off from Jesus Christ.''
   The last prelate to incur public excommunication was Swiss
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, according to Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a
historian. Lefebvre was excommunicated in 1988 after he consecrated
four bishops for a new religious community that rejected the
teachings of the Second Vatican Council.

   Debra Murphree, the former prostitute whose
liaison with preacher Jimmy Swaggart rocked an evangelical empire,
has signed away three-quarters of the $210,000 that Penthouse paid
for her story.
   Murphree will receive about $54,000 for the article published in
July 1988, said Louis H. Schultz, her attorney. Agents, attorneys
and the Internal Revenue Service will get the rest.
   ``She's happy. I talked with her on the telephone,'' Schultz
said Monday.
   Agents and the IRS had claimed they were owed $428,000 by
Murphree, who claimed that the Baton Rouge-based TV evangelist was
a regular customer in 1987.
   However, Schultz said their figures were based on inflated
estimates of the amount Penthouse owed for the article and a
promotional tour and _ in the IRS' $217,000 claim _ for income from
prostitution.
   Murphree told Penthouse that Swaggart paid her $20 a visit to
strike prurient poses and perform sexual acts.
   Swaggart tearfully confessed to an unspecified ``moral failure''
and was subsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God. Layoffs
and cutbacks followed at his multimillion-dollar Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries.

   The Communist Party leader in the Siberian city of
Sverdlovsk has resigned in a growing wave of discontent over
regional and local party practices, the newspaper Trud reported on
today.
   The resignation of Leonid Bobykin was announced Monday at a
meeting of party activists from the Sverdlovsk region following a
six-month campaign to oust him, the newspaper said. He was accused
of not acting in the spirit of glasnost, or openness, the report
said.
   Last week, regular party members had charged the Sverdlovsk
leadership with anti-democratic policies and passed a vote of no
confidence in Bobykin, the Izvestia newspaper reported on Friday.
   Soviet newspapers and television recently have reported a series
of resignations of party officials, including the party leader in
the central Siberian region of Tyumen and the leader in Volgograd
on charges of corruption.
   Increasing calls for greater democracy and shortages throughout
the Soviet Union of everything from soap to shoes have made the
people sensitive to the performance and attitude of party officials.

<TEXT>
   This country is in the throes of the
first known epidemic of childhood AIDS caused by contaminated blood
and the constant reuse of needles, a French humanitarian
organization says.
   Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the Paris-based Doctors of the
World, on Monday urged the international health community to
provide Romania with disposable needles and blood-screening
equipment.
   ``We know AIDS from people who take drugs, homosexuals, and
heterosexuals in Africa, but for the first time in the history of
AIDS, we are confronted with childhood AIDS,'' he said.
   ``It's an epidemic,'' he said. ``It's on the level of famine.
It's an international emergency.''
   Doctors said they do not know how many children have AIDS, but
that at one hospital alone 33 of the 45 people who have died of the
disease since 1985 were young children.
   In Geneva, a World Health Organization spokeswoman said the U.N.
agency has sent two experts to Bucharest to investigate the extent
of AIDS among Romanian children. Spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said
the visit, which began Monday and is expected to last about a week,
was requested by the Romanian Health Ministry.
   The Romanian outbreak is unusual because it does not involve the
transmission of the virus from mother to fetus _ the manner in
which most children around the world are infected _ but from
contaminated blood transfusions and needles, he said.
   ``In the adult population, the incidence of AIDS is very low,''
Lebas said, adding that more than 98 percent of mothers of infected
children do not carry the virus.
   Blood transfusions are routinely used in Romania as a treatment
for premature babies, sick children and the thousands of youngsters
suffering from malnutrition, he said. But needles are in short
supply and are routinely used hundreds of times, encouraging the
spread of the virus.
   Like other East bloc nations, Romania is short of disposable
syringes and other medical supplies.
   Lebas said Romania's AIDS outbreak was considered a ``state
secret'' under Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was
toppled in a bloody revolution in December and executed on
Christmas Day.
   Last month, Dr. Ludovic Paun of the infectious diseases
department at Bucharest's Victor Babes Hospital said 69 people
treated there had developed AIDS since 1985, among them 53 young
children. He said 33 of the 45 AIDS fatalities so far were children
3 or younger.
   Lebas did not have updated statistics on AIDS deaths. But he
said an initial screening of 1,025 children up to 3 years old at
several hospitals and orphanages found 367 with the virus that
causes AIDS _ human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   Dr. Ion Patrascu, a researcher at the Institute of Virology,
said 60 percent of the 283 children with HIV who are hospitalized
have full-blown AIDS. The children in orphanages who tested
positive for the virus will be checked this week to see whether
they have developed the disease, he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims vulnerable to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. A person can carry the HIV virus for years without
developing AIDS, but almost all cases lead to the disease.
   Children have been tested in Bucharest, Arad in western Romania,
Focsani in the northeast and the southern Black Sea port city of
Constanta, where the incidence was very high. Patrascu said tests
would be carried out at hospitals and orphanages in Timisoara and
other cities this week.
   ``This outbreak is unusual in the world,'' he said. ``We need
specialists to come here from the United States, France, Britain
and other countries to decide what to do.''
   Doctors of the World signed a contract with the Romanian
government on Monday to set up a laboratory in Bucharest to test
for pediatric AIDS, he said.
   But Romania has no money to carry out a proper epidemiological
study to determine the real number of AIDS cases in the general
population, Patrascu said.
   ``We hope when the general population is tested, we won't have
this result,'' Lebas said.
   He said he secretly took blood samples in July to test for the
AIDS virus in children and was not able to confirm his results
until after the revolution, when the French organization took 29
samples to Paris.
   Patrascu said the contaminated blood came from Romanians,
although at first it was thought it came from foreign students.
   Lebas said one pint of blood from an adult could be used in
transfusions for up to 15 children.

   President Bush, facing demands from
Democrats for steep defense cuts in the wake of the receding Soviet
threat in Europe, headed West today on a three-day trip aimed at
boosting support for his go-slow approach to streamlining the
Pentagon.
   ``This should be a very good trip emphasizing some of our
defense requirements needs and a little politics mixed in,'' Bush
told reporters shortly after Air Force One departed Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington.
   Bush plans appearances at fund-raisers for Republican candidates
in California, Nebraska and Ohio.
   ``We'll be doing more of that this year,'' Bush told reporters.
   He was putting the emphasis on national defense during the
official portions of the trip, including his first stop today to
address troops and view war games at the Army's National Training
Center at Fort Irwin in Barstow, Calif.
   On Wednesday Bush will visit Livermore Laboratory, the nerve
center of Strategic Defense Initiative research where scientists
will brief him on the latest development in space-based antimissile
technology.
   His itinerary includes a million-dollar fund-raising dinner
tonight in Los Angeles for Sen. Pete Wilson, hoping to succeed
fellow Republican George Deukmejian as governor of the most
populous state; a speech on defense policy Wednesday before the
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and a visit to Strategic Air
Command headquarters in Omaha on Thursday.
   The San Francisco Bay area is home to five of the bases and
military facilities on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's list of 72
possible base closures or cutbacks _ a list disclosed the same day
Bush sent Congress a proposed $292 billion defense budget for
fiscal 1991.
   While Bush said his spending blueprint offers a chance to
``restructure America's defenses'' in the wake of the revolutionary
shift toward democracy in Eastern Europe, it envisions troop
reductions of only 38,000 in the year ahead and cutbacks in 20
minor conventional weapon programs while seeking $1 billion in new
funds for Star Wars research and moving ahead on major weapons
systems. After inflation, it amounts to a 2 percent defense cut.
   Bush also proposed last week to bring 50,000 more U.S. troops
home from Europe but did not set a timetable. In any event, those
savings would not show up in the 1991 budget.
   Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Thomas Foley, have
said they will press for larger defense savings.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``The Soviet
challenge remains very much real. Their strategic buildup is
continuing. ... This is not a time to lay down our arms.''
   ``The president thinks it's important to talk to the American
people about the changes that we're seeing'' in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, Fitzwater said. ``That's the whole reason for
this trip _ that our posture is changing and he wants a chance to
explain it.''
   Fitzwater said, ``The president will stress his continued
support for strategic modernization.'' That includes spending
billions to put the MX missiles on rails and building the new
multi-warhead Midgetman missile.
   ``Despite the lessening of tensions in many areas of the world,
the United States must continue to maintain a robust and credible
nuclear deterrent,'' Fitzwater said.
   Democrats have complained that most of the bases on Cheney's hit
list are in districts represented by Democrats in the House.
   But Fitzwater said, ``For those who are interested in a peace
dividend, they're seeing that that's where part of it will come
from.''
   Bush also will attend a breakfast fund-raiser for Nebraska Gov.
Kay Orr in Omaha on Thursday and tour a Head Start facility in
Columbus, Ohio, and attend an Ohio GOP dinner that night before
returning to the White House.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today the United States is
in ``excellent economic health'' and will experience ``strong,
sustained economic growth'' for the foreseeable future.
   Bush offered the rosy assessment in the first annual economic
report he has submitted. A summary of the message was released at
the White House after Bush signed the document at an Oval Office
ceremony.
   The report broadly spells out the economic principles that Bush
said will guide his administration.
   After dispatching the report to Congress, Bush left on a
three-day trip to the West in an effort to boost public support for
his $292 billion defense budget amid demands from Democrats for
steep spending cuts.
   In his report, Bush said, ``Our excellent economic health will
allow us to build on the successes of the 1980s as we prepare for
the next century.
   ``I am confident that the United States can enjoy strong,
sustained economic growth and use the fruits of that growth to
raise living standards, solve longstanding problems, deal with new
challenges and make the most of new opportunities,'' Bush said.
   The president said that since the end of the 1981-82 recession,
the United States has experienced the longest peacetime economic
expansion in history, with the creation of 20 million new jobs.
   ``The containment of inflation during this long economic
expansion is a milestone in postwar U.S. history,'' the summary
said.
   ``Despite our successes,'' Bush said, ``we cannot be satisfied
with simply sustaining the strong record of the 1980s. We must
improve on that record, deal with inherited problems and meet the
new challenges and seize the new opportunities before us.''
   He said his primary goal was ``to achieve the highest possible
rate of sustainable economic growth.''
   Bush pledged to try to reduce government borrowing by slowing
the growth of federal spending. He said economic growth would raise
revenue to balance the budget and then reduce the national debt.
   He also said he would support ``a credible, systematic monetary
policy program that sustains maximum economic growth while
controlling and reducing inflation.''
   In addition, Bush promised to remove federal barriers to
investment, saving and innovation and work to ``avoid unnecessary
regulation.''
   The president said the United States would ``continue to lead
the world to freer trade and more open markets, and to support
market-oriented reforms around the world.''

   A former stockbroker who bilked his golf buddies,
his lawyer, his accountant and others out of more than $2 million
has been sentenced to five years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Edward F. Harrington on Monday also placed
Walter F. Curran on five years' probation and ordered the
47-year-old former broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. to
reimburse his victims.
   Curran, 47, had pleaded guilty to fraud and violating currency
transaction reporting laws. He was arrested in 1989 in the
disappearance of $2.39 million he had persuaded friends and
associates to invest.
   Defense attorney Robert Cordy said Curran promised eight people,
including two golfing companions, interest of 20 percent if they
invested in a deferred compensation account in his name.
   Instead, over the next eight years, Curran invested in the stock
market, with some of the money going toward his living expenses.
When the market crashed October 1987, he lost his investors' money,
as well as much of his own, Cordy said.
   Curran fled to Canada. He was found to be carrying over $132,000
in cash when he was arrested at the border upon his return.
   ``He had tried everything, from gambling to long shots,'' Cordy
said. ``Eventually when everything came crashing down, there was no
way he could continue to juggle the balls and get the money back.''

   Rival Christian factions blasted each
other with howitzers and rockets today as France tried to halt the
ferocious struggle for control of Lebanon's Christian heartland.
   Police said at least 22 people were killed and more than 50
wounded in the fighting today between troops loyal to Gen. Michel
Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea, bringing the
overall toll to at least 299 killed and 1,087 wounded.
   Most of the casualties have been civilians caught in the
cross-fire.
   Aoun's command said its troops had ``crushed the last pockets of
resistance'' among the Lebanese Forces in the northern suburb of
Dbaye.
   The Lebanese Forces conceded the loss in a communique, saying
its fighters were ordered to redeploy north of Dbaye. It said
Aoun's ``hysteric shelling'' transformed Dbaye into ``ruins.''
   The Hotel Dieu Hospital, the largest in Christian east Beirut,
issued a statement saying its morgue was packed with decomposing
bodies, and the situation was worsened by a power failure.
   ``We find ourselves obliged to bury the victims in a mass grave
in Ashrafiyeh Wednesday if no one shows up to collect them,'' the
hospital said in a statement broadcast by the Christian Voice of
Lebanon radio.
   The international committee of the Red Cross, French
humanitarian minister Bernard Kouchner and Maronite Catholic
patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir issued separate calls for an immediate
cease-fire.
   Today's barrages targeted the militia-controlled residential
districts of Ashrafiyeh, Jemmayzeh, Karantina and Ein Rummaneh,
according to the police spokesman.
   He said Geagea's gunners were responding by shelling the
Aoun-held districts of Sin el-Fil, Furn el-Shubbak, Hazmiyeh and
Fayadiyeh as well as the eastern suburb of Baabda, which houses the
general' headquarters.
   Heavy rains helped put out small fires in east Beirut, but palls
of thick, black smoke billowed out over the Mediterranean from
blazing fuel and cooking gas depots in the Aoun-held Dora district
on the northern edge of east Beirut.
   Aoun's tanks stormed through Lebanese Forces' defenses in Dbaye
Monday, achieving the first significant gain in the showdown for
control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, which encompasses
east Beirut and communities to the north.
   The thud of shell explosions echoed across Beirut.
   ``The devil is behind these violations,'' said Archbishop Ronald
Abi Nader, a representative of Maronite patriarch Sfeir, who has
worked on a series of ill-fated cease-fire attempts. He said
representatives of Aoun and Geagea would meet at the Vatican
Embassy today.
   Abi Nader's statement was broadcast by the Moslem Voice of the
Nation radio, based in west Beirut. His Catholic sect is the
dominant Christian group that has controlled Lebanon's police,
military and judiciary since independence from France in 1943.
   Both Geagea and Aoun are Maronites like President Elias Hrawi.
However, Aoun rejects Hrawi's Syrian-backed Christian-Moslem
government, while Geagea recognizes it.
   Hrawi, was elected by Parliament Nov. 24 with a mandate to
oversee a peace plan brokered by the Arab League. He fired Aoun as
interim prime minister and army commander, but Aoun refused to quit.
   Aoun rejected the peace accord, an attempt to end 15 years of
sectarian civil war, because it fails to guarantee the withdrawal
of 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon. Aoun considers the Syrians,
who entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, to be an army of occupation.

   Drought and a vegetation-drying Christmas
freeze have combined to cause central Florida's worst spell of
wildfires in five years, officals say.
   Polk, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, which include Tampa
and St. Petersburg, have been hardest hit, with 122 brush fires
reported since Jan. 1, almost triple last year's rate. Statewide,
817 fires have scorched more than 20,000 acres.
   The region south of Gainesville, from Tampa Bay on Florida's
western coast to Daytona Beach on the Atlantic coast, is considered
a high-risk fire zone, according to a state index that ranks fire
danger as low, moderate, high, very high or extreme.
   And it doesn't look like any relief is on the way. January's
rainfall did not reach the 2.4-inch average.
   ``Unless we get a lot of moisture very soon, we'll be in a very
high fire system and then we'll become extreme,'' said Jim Brenner
of the state Division of Forestry in Tallahassee.
   The Christmas freeze provided much of the fuel for the fires by
killing large amounts of vegetation.
   The drought could bring a repeat of last year's springtime fires
that blackened large sections of the Everglades.
   ``It may be even worse this year,'' Brenner said.

   Liberal Communist Party leaders today attacked
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's daring plan for ending the party's monopoly
on power as not radical enough to solve the country's pressing
problems, participants said.
   But Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a hard-liner, called for
a careful review of the Soviet president's proposals to
fundamentally alter this nation's system of government.
   Gorbachev on Monday opened a pivotal session of the Central
Committee by proposing the party abandon its monopoly on power and
be forced to compete with other parties for the right to lead the
country.
   Some speakers at today's Central Committee session criticized
the platform, saying it was ``based on old dogmas,'' said Alexander
Fomin, a coal miner invited as a guest to the meeting.
   ``There were not enough radical proposals to solve the party's
problems,'' Fomin said, summarizing today's debate he offered
during a break in the closed-door session.
   He did not detail the objections, and the Soviet media carried
no details of today's session.
   Another participant, Gen. Igor I. Kurenoi, said Ligachev, who
last week came under attack in a newspaper for his conservative
views, called in a speech for reviewing Gorbachev's proposals
carefully.
   Libachev also pointed out shortcomings of the leadership's
policies but did not propose solutions, Fomin said. The official
news agency Tass said 16 people spoke today, including Ligachev and
several other Politburo members.
   Gorbachev, as expected, is in the middle of an intense struggle
between progressives and conservatives over whether to completely
abandon the centralized system of government in favor of a
multiparty political system with a more capitalist economy.
   The session has taken on crisis proportions because of the
worsening Soviet economy and a rise in ethnic unrest throughout the
country. It comes on the heels of a breathtaking series of revolts
against old orthodox socialist governments in six East bloc nations.
   Meanwhile, the Communist party leader in the Siberian city of
Sverdlovsk resigned because he refused to embrace reform, the
newspaper Trud reported today. Last week, party members had charged
the Sverdlovsk leadership with anti-democratic policies and passed
a vote of no confidence.
   Soviet media have reported several resignations of party
officials. Increasing calls for greater democracy and shortages
throughout the Soviet Union have made citizens more sensitive to
the performance party officials.
   On Monday, Gorbachev told the party's policy-making Central
Committee that by letting outmoded ideas govern their policy,
socialist countries had during the 20th century isolated themselves
from ``the general flow of civilization.''
   But his proposal met with stiff resistance in the largely
conservative 249-member body. One participant said committee
members did not applaud Gorbachev or anyone else on the first day
of the two-day closed session.
   Speaking confidently just days after rumors swept the world that
he might step down as party chief, Gorbachev on Monday presented a
new political program for the Communist Party based on a bill of
rights.
   ``Man and his well-being are put in the center of the party's
policy from now on and forever,'' he said. The speech, released
later by Tass, did not detail the rights he wants to enshrine in
the party's platform.
   Gorbachev did not suggest that the party give up efforts to lead
the country. Instead, he said it ``intends to struggle for the role
of ruling party, but strictly in the framework of the democratic
process, rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage.''
   At some point, he said, growing pluralism ``can lead to the
creation of parties.''
   Gorbachev called for an end to a tenet of Leninism called
``democratic centralism,'' which demands strict allegiance by the
party's 20 million members to decisions made at the top.
   He said the party's views on managing the economy and the
government should no longer be pressed on Soviet society.
   The Communists have been widely assailed for the dismal state of
the economy and for widespread abuses of power.
   Gorbachev acknowledged that the country, which suffers severe
shortages of consumer goods, has not seen any fundamental
improvement from the economic reform program he has championed
since coming to power in 1985.
   He said key obstacles to those changes were old attitudes and
the failure to reform prices.
   Transcripts released by Tass indicated Gorbachev underwent
immediate, stinging criticism. One committee source said Leningrad
party chief Boris Gidaspov, who has become a lightning rod for
conservatives, demanded the establishment of strict law and order.
   The Soviet ambassador to Poland, Vladimir I. Brovikov, told the
committee that democracy without discipline is unthinkable because
it leads to chaos, Tass reported today.
   In his speech, Gorbachev advocated a stronger presidency for the
Soviet state, according to Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a participant in
the meeting.
   Many people think he hopes eventually to step down as head of a
no longer supreme Communist Party and find a new power base as
president with the support of elected legislative bodies.
   Participants said they expected easy approval of Gorbachev's
proposal to drop Article 6 of the constitution, which guarantees
the Communist Party the leading role in society.
   Final approval for the plaform would come at the next party
congress, which Gorbachev suggested moving up to June or July from
the fall. A new Central Committee is expected to be seated at the
congress, giving Gorbachev the opportunty to remove aging
hard-liners and replace them with supporters.
   He also said the Central Committee would meet again in about a
month and consider creating a smaller, nearly full-time Central
Committee.
   Voters are expected to soundly reject Communist candidates in
local elections this spring and Gorbachev clearly wants to move
quickly to reform the party before it loses more credibility.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov acknowledged Monday that the country
already has moved toward a multiparty system, with alternative
parties cropping up in many places.
   Such parties have been active in the Baltic republics and in the
southern Caucasus, where Gorbachev sent troops last month to put
down a nationalist uprising in Azerbaijan and quell ethnic rioting.
   More than 1,000 people, including 100 non-voting members of the
Central Committee, military district commanders and local party and
government officials attended the meeting, a participant said.

   All Los Angeles students will have to go to
school year-round by 1991 to ease overcrowding in the nation's
second-largest district.
   In a four-hour session marked by name-calling and shouting, the
Board of Education voted 4-3 Monday to put all schools now on
traditional schedules _ nine months of class and three months'
summer vacation _ on a full-year calendar.
   Nearly 100 schools already follow year-round schedules, under
which students go to school for three months, take the following
month off, and so on, for the rest of the year. About 500 schools
are on regular schedules.
   The vote was met by opposition from hundreds of parents who
feared children in the same family would be placed on varying
schedules, making coordination of baby-sitting and vacations
troublesome.
   ``I think this is going to drive us more toward a two-tiered
education, where you have folks in private school and the people in
public school are there because they don't have the money to go to
private school,'' said Pam Bruns, a leader of a parents group in
the affluent Pacific Palisades area.
   The Los Angeles district, which ranks behind New York City's
with 610,000 students, becomes the biggest in the nation to move to
year-round classes. The plan, endorsed by Superintendent Leonard
Britton, would increase the district's student capacity by 62,000
in the next two years.
   ``It's very difficult because each of our areas has different
problems, different points of view,'' board member Julie Korenstein
said. ``At the same time, we have a district that's incredibly
overcrowded and we have to come up with some way out.''
   Board members Rita Walters and Leticia Quezada argued that the
plan unfairly targets minority students attending overcrowded
campuses.
   About 95 percent of those students already attending year-round
schools are minorities, Quezada said. But only 16 percent of the
first batch of students slated to convert to a year-round schedule
are white, she said.
   ``Sometimes we try to ignore reality, and the reality is it is a
racial issue,'' she said. ``Whether or not you want to accept it,
it is a racial issue.''
   The plan requires all public schools on traditional schedules to
submit plans for year-round classes in time for the 1991-92 school
year.
   Each school will be free to stagger its schedule, with some
grades in class and others on vacation, so that the building is in
continuous use.
   The superintendent had called for 109 schools with severe
overcrowding to adopt a year-round schedule by July. But the board
voted to give those schools until July 1991 to make the conversion.
   Members acknowledged that adopting a continuous calendar
district-wide could set a precedent for other urban school systems.
   ``The time had to come when the issue has escalated to what it
is today,'' said board member Roberta Weintraub. ``As Los Angeles
goes as a school district, so goes the nation.''

<TEXT>
   The FBI is poring over lists of auction
bidders in a search for the manual typewriter linked to two mail
bombings.
   ``We are no longer conducting large-scale searches, but we're
still there in pretty substantial numbers,'' FBI agent Tom Moore of
Birmingham said Monday of the investigation of the mail-bomb
slayings of a judge and a lawyer.
   Federal agents believe the typewriter was used to write
threatening letters sent by the bomber. Following a list of
registered bidders, agents Monday began tracing typewriters sold at
auctions at the nearby Fort Rucker Army base and looked over three
typewriters at a piano store.
   Store manager Dean Powers said FBI agents were interested in
typewriters bought at auction at Fort Rucker. He said the agents
examined one electric typewriter and two manual typewriters but did
not remove them from the store.
   The mail bombs exploded in December, killing 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance near Birmingham and lawyer
Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga.
   During the past two weeks, scores of agents searched homes,
businesses, a lake, schools, a trash dump and even septic tanks in
a hunt for the typewriter.
   The FBI probe in Enterprise has focused on a junk dealer, Robert
Wayne O'Ferrell, and print shop operator Brian Joseph Fleming, who
has been indicted in a separate case on charges of trying to
illegally export firearms.
   Ken Holder, a Fort Rucker spokesman, said typewriters are sold
at periodic auctions on the base. He said that O'Ferrell was a
registered bidder at the auctions but that anyone who has a junk
business probably would show up at the bidding.
   ``I can't locate whether he purchased anything,'' the spokesman
said.
   O'Ferrell said he had been to at least three sales at Fort
Rucker and had purchased typewriters.
   He has denied any knowledge of the bombings.
   He came under scrutiny because he had an employment compensation
case that he lost on appeal before a three-judge panel of the 11th
Circuit, including Vance, and because of alleged similarities in
O'Ferrell's typed correspondence and letters apparently sent by the
mail bomber.
   O'Ferrell last week acknowledged that he used at least four
typewriters in filing his own legal documents with the 11th
Circuit, but he said the one agents looked for at his business
could have been sold.
   In Atlanta on Monday, about 200 judges, lawyers, friends and
relatives of Vance passed through tight security to attend a
memorial service in a federal courtroom a few feet from Vance's
chambers.

   Israeli soldiers sealed rooms in two
Palestinian homes today in a new army policy that lets authorities
close all or part of houses where residents are suspected of
hurling rocks at troops.
   Another Palestinian was reported killed today when a civilian
opened fire on rock throwers who attacked his truck in the West
Bank.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, leader of a hard-line faction in
the right-wing Likud bloc, called for Egypt to be excluded from
Middle East peace efforts, saying it backs the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   His spoke as bereaved families buried victims of a weekend bus
attack outside Cairo. Egyptian authorities said they were searching
for two Palestinian suspects in the attack, in which nine Israelis
died when their tour bus was raked with gunfire and grenades.
   The new policy on sealing homes, which could affect hundreds of
families in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, drew immediate criticism
from civil rights groups and liberal politicians, who said the
measure amounted to collective punishment.
   In the nearly 26-month-old uprising, the army has razed or
sealed hundreds of homes to punish Arabs suspected of fire bombings
or serious attacks. But the penalty was not used for stone
throwing, the most common tactic of teen-agers at the forefront of
the uprising against Israeli occupation.
   In Nablus, Mustafa Abed Kulab, 45, was fatally shot in the neck,
Arab reports said. The reports initially said Kulab was shot by
Israeli soldiers, but later reports indicated he was shot by an
Israeli driver after his fuel truck was stoned.
   The army confirmed the death but said its troops were not
involved.
   Kulab's death raised to 652 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation began in December 1987.
   In addition, 181 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.
   The new house-sealing policy was announced by Col. Ahaz Ben-Ari,
the army's legal adviser for the West Bank. He said it was
necessary because of ``the danger of stone throwing.''
   ``Because this phenomenon is still deeply rooted and, lately to
our great regret is on an increase, it was decided to widen this
sanction for this phenomenon in an attempt to quell it,'' Ben-Ari
told Israel radio.
   According to army figures, at least 395 houses have been
demolished or sealed since the uprising began. Al Haq-Law in the
Service of Man, a Palestinian group that monitors human rights
abuses in the territories, puts the total at 550 or more.
   As Ben-Ari was announcing the new rules, the army said that
troops had sealed rooms in two homes of suspected stone throwers.
   They included a house in Nablus, where a family member is
accused of shattering the windshield of a car and injuring the
Israeli driver, and another in Qalqilya, where a stone thrower
injured a border policeman, army reports said.
   In each case, one room was left open for the families.
   The new rule was immediately challenged by Parliament member
Dedi Zucker of the left-of-center Citizens Rights Movement. Zucker
described the policy as ``another escalation of the circle of
hate'' and said it constituted ``punishment without trial.''
   Khaled Batrawi, Al Haq's specialist on house demolitions, said
the demolitions and house sealings are illegal. They constitute
collective punishment that is prohibited by international law, and
they violate the 4th Geneva Convention.''
   The 4th Geneva Convention, which Israel signed, protects the
rights of civilians during war and under occupation.
   The United States and international human rights groups also
have repeatedly criticized demolitions and sealings, noting the
action almost always takes place before the suspect is tried.

<HEAD>Author of 1980 Malathion Safety Report Disavows Findings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An author of a 1980 state study used to
defend the spraying of a Medfly pesticide now says his findings
were edited to understate the danger to humans.
   Marc A. Lappe, professor of health policy and ethics at the
University of Illinois, said Monday that he found that malathion
could cause six extra cases of cancer for every million people _ a
figure later reduced to one additional case.
   Lappe said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that his
findings indicated the health risk from malathion spraying is six
times greater than what the report officially concluded. He said he
resigned in 1981 because of the changes.
   ``The public has been ramrodded into accepting this without
their basic right to have a full airing,'' Lappe said. ``It could
be quite dangerous to infants, the elderly and the infirm.''
   However, Ephraim Kahn, Lappe's supervisor at the state Health
Department in 1980, said that the original findings had been based
on false assumptions that the chemical could cause cancer and on
overly negative presumptions that children would be drenched with
it during night spraying.
   ``The implication that his numbers were changed to hide some
serious effect is just ridiculous,'' Kahn said.
   State health researchers used worst-case probabilities in the
1980 report to be on the conservative side, Lappe said.
   Lappe's public reversal bolstered claims by malathion opponents
that repeated aerial pesticide sprayings aimed at Medflies could
cause illness among residents in affected areas.
   Lappe has filed an affidavit in support of a lawsuit brought by
the Orange County cities of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and
Westminster to stop the aerial pesticide missions against the
crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly.
   He did not say why he did not come forward sooner.
   State officials on Monday announced plans to create a Southern
California panel that would study the air and water in spray areas
and advise the state on any dangers. The panel will include local
health experts.
   Five helicopters took to the sky overnight on a spraying mission
in Glendale, Sun Valley and Burbank. The spraying is going on
throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   Agricultural officials warn that the Medfly in Los Angeles and
Orange counties threatens California's $16 billion farm economy.
The Medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 kinds of produce.
   Dr. James Stratton, an epidemiologist with the state Department
of Health Services, said the National Toxicology Program determined
in a 1985 study that a cancer risk from malathion virtually could
not be detected.
   Researchers at the National Cancer Institute discovered a
slightly higher risk of cancer from malathion exposure in rats and
mice but reported no significant link between the pesticide and
cancer in humans.

   A small leak of the chemical that killed
3,500 people in India in 1984 has revived fears by residents of
``Chemical Valley'' that they are sitting on a time bomb.
   ``This is another Bhopal waiting to happen,'' said Mildred Holt,
co-president of People Concerned About MIC. ``We're living in
terror.''
   Seven workers were injured when methyl isocyanate leaked Friday
morning at the former Union Carbide plant along the Kanawha River
about 10 miles west of Charleston. The leak was not announced until
Monday.
   The workers suffered burns to their eyes, said plant manager Ron
Bearer. Two required hospital treatment and were released.
   The ounce-size leak occurred as workers were performing
maintenance on the methyl isocynate unit at Rhone-Poulenc, which
purchased Union Carbide's agricultural products division in 1986.
   Bearer said the plant did not have to file a report with
emergency officials because the leak involved less than a pound of
material. He said the incident was considered to be of such little
importance that he wasn't notified until hours afterward.
   ``It was such a minor thing ... the alarm didn't even go outside
of the unit. My office is in the middle of the plant, and I wasn't
aware of it until today,'' Rhone-Poulenc spokeswoman Bonnie
Blashford said Monday.
   Paul Pribyl, manager for Brown &amp; Root construction of Houston,
whose workers were injured, said it is plant policy to notify
personnel when potentially hazardous work is being done nearby.
   ``For some reason it wasn't followed in this instance. There was
some sort of breakdown in communications,'' he said. The Brown &amp;
Root workers were building a new unit elsewhere in the plant
complex.
   Bob Weser of the state Air Pollution Control Commission said
there was no cause for alarm because the material stayed within the
plant complex.
   Others expressed concern about the reporting delay.
   ``I think we have a problem,'' said Mark Wolford, Kanawha County
public safety director.
   ``Plant officials said the leak was so small they felt it was
not in the reportable quantity,'' Wolford said. ``We are still in
the process of investigating this and are asking the plant to meet
with us.''
   The chemical is an ingredient in agricultural pesticides. A
December 1984 leak at a nearly identical Union Carbide plant in
Bhopal, India, killed 3,500 people.
   An August 1985 leak of a different chemical in Union Carbide's
pesticide plant in Institute injured 135. In that incident,
officials were angered that it took the plant nearly 20 minutes to
notify emergency services.
   Chemical Valley gets its name from the more than two dozen
chemical plants along a 15-mile stretch of the Kanawha River.

<HEAD>Government Proposes New Constitution to Allow Multi-Party System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government leaders have proposed a
new constitution that abolishes the Communist Party's 45-year
monopoly on power in favor of a multiparty system, an official said
today.
   Stipe Suvar, a member of Yugoslavia's ruling collective state
presidency, told a press conference that the new constitution would
also regulate ``a procedure'' under which a Yugoslav republic might
se| forward by the eight-member presidency will start in the
federal Parliament on Feb. 14, Suvar said.
   He added, however, that ``no one knows'' when the new
constitution would be adopted since it needs the approval of all
six often factious Yugoslav republics and two provinces to be
passed.
   The proposals come at a time of seemingly irreconcilable
differences between the republics. The Communist Party in Slovenia
on Sunday broke away from the national party and declared itself
independent.
   The current constitution, adopted in 1974 during the rule of
Yugoslavia's Communist founder Josip Broz Tito, granted wide
autonomy to the republics and is generally blamed for the country's
worst political and economic crisis in history.
   Parliament earlier this month started began liberal amendments
on political activity and free speech to the current constitution
proposed by the reformist government of Premier Ante Markovic.
   The amendments, which also call for Western-style democracy,
``will only facilitate the adoption of the new constitution,''
Suvar said.
   He said he expected the amendments to be passed in spring, just
ahead of the country's first free multi-party elections after World
War II, scheduled for April.
   Yugoslavia's Communists were the first to break with the
Soviet-led East bloc in 1948. But the country has been slower in
adopting democratic reforms than other East European countries
because of deep ethnic and economic divisions.
   Liberal-minded Slovenia has expressed increasing frustration at
resistance to reform by the largest republic, Serbia, and there are
increasing indications Slovenians might want to secede from the
rest of the federation.
   ``The new Yugoslav constitution will precisely define the
complicated procedure of secession,'` Suvar said, adding that a
regional referendum within a republic might become a legal way for
it to break off from the rest of Yugoslavia.
   In Yugoslavia, the federal government is generally responsible
for economic policy while the collective presidency, which appoints
the premier, dictates defense and foreign policy.
   But the bulk of political influence in the country is
concentrated in the Communist Pparty, with power dispersed in eight
often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative
division of the country.
   The government essentially follows guidelines set by the party
bodies that must themselves hammer out a consensus before any
policies can be implemented.

   The $550 million Gamma Ray
Observatory arrived aboard a giant cargo plane today for liftoff
next year on a mission to help scientists unlock the secrets of the
universe from high above the Earth.
   The 17-ton observatory was trucked from TRW Inc. in Redondo
Beach, Calif., which built the satellite, to Los Angeles
International Airport on Monday. It was flown aboard an Air Force
C-5A to the Kennedy Space Center.
   It is scheduled to be placed in Earth orbit in November by space
shuttle Atlantis, and will be the heaviest spacecraft ever deployed
by a shuttle, said TRW spokeswoman Montye Male.
   The Gamma Ray Observatory is the second of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Great Observatories, which
the agency says will help scientists understand the birth and
structure of the universe, and the origin and evolution of stars,
planets and life.
   The first Great Observatory is the Hubble Space Telescope, which
is scheduled to be launched from space shuttle Discovery in April.
The others are the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, which is
to be launched from a shuttle in 1997, and the Space Infrared
Telescope Facility, scheduled for launch from a rocket in 1999.
   Each of the observatories will detect a different form of
electromagnetic radiation: visible light, gamma rays, X-rays and
infrared light, which is heat.
   The Hubble is an incredibly powerful optical telescope that will
look back almost to the beginning of time to study light from stars
and galaxies.
   The Gamma Ray Observatory will be equipped with four detectors
to spend two to eight or more years studying gamma rays emitted by
various processes in space, including the ``big bang,'' which is
the gargantuan explosion scientists believe created the universe
about 15 billion years ago.
   Gamma rays ``are called the messengers of creation because when
the big bang started everything off, gamma rays were emitted,''
Male said. She said the observatory will conduct ``a comprehensive
scientific effort to learn more about the origin and fate of the
universe.''
   ``Through the GRO's instruments, humankind may be able to
witness the birth of elements, the death of stars, and discover
clues about quasars, pulsars and black holes,'' she said.
   Most of the elements that make up Earth and all living things
were created by the death of stars in fiery supernova explosions.
Pulsars and black holes are the incredibly dense remnants of
supernovas. Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are mysterious
sources of vast amounts of light and other energy.
   The observatory is now 15-by-30-by-15 feet, but once its solar
panels are deployed when it is in its 279-mile-high orbit, the
observatory's width will grow from 30 to 70 feet, Male said.
   TRW built the observatory under a $250 million NASA contract.
The total cost will be $550 million once its gamma ray detectors
are installed in Florida, she added.

   Florida's chief tax collector resigned
today amid allegations she singled out a political opponent of her
husband's for an audit.
   In stepping down, revenue director Katie Tucker told Gov. Bob
Martinez and the Cabinet, ``I emphatically and unequivocally deny
that I have ever abused the powers of my office for any purpose.''
   Ms. Tucker, 46, has headed the Department of Revenue since June
1988.
   Martinez and the Cabinet had suspended Ms. Tucker with pay two
weeks ago to allow her time to respond to a Florida Department of
Law Enforcement report on a 1988 tax investigation of businesses
owned by Donald G. Resha.
   The FDLE found that Ms. Tucker committed no crime but that she
personally ordered the probe of Resha, who lost a 1985 election for
the state AFL-CIO presidency to her husband, Daniel Miller.
   Ms. Tucker has maintained she ordered a larger investigation
aimed at finding whether video stores like those owned by Resha
were failing to pay taxes and whether they were involved in other
criminal wrongdoing.
   Ms. Tucker and her attorney, Barry Richard, told Martinez and
the Cabinet that the director could not defend herself against a
perception of abusing her office.
   Ms. Tucker also said she is battling breast cancer and that her
doctors said the stress of trying save her $85,292-a-year job could
be harmful.
   ``It's not worth even a moment more of wasted energy on fights
that can only hurt me,'' she said. ``The truth will prevail.
Regardless of the outcome, you stand up for what's right.''
   Last week, the FDLE began a new investigation into possible
document tampering. On Friday, FDLE agents confiscated documents
and a memory typewriter from Ms. Tucker's office. Ms. Tucker denied
tampering with any documents.

   President Bush's top environmental adviser
said today the president is ``responding very well'' to the
challenges of global warming despite complaints from
environmentalists of inadequate leadership from the White House on
the issue.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
defended Bush's speech to a global warming conference Monday, in
which the president called for more research before specific
commitments are made to reduce so-called ``greenhouse'' pollution.
   ``The speech that was delivered was first rate,'' Reilly told a
congressional hearing. He said that while he was not directly
involved in writing the speech, ``two-thirds to three-fourths'' of
the suggestions he submitted to the White House were incorporated
in the final draft.
   The remarks reportedly were toned down by White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, who has expressed concern that efforts to reduce
global warming might cause severe economic disruptions.
   ``I think the president is responding very well to the major
problem we have'' on the global warming issue, Reilly told the
Senate Government Affairs Committee.
   Reilly appeared before the committee to endorse bipartisan
legislation that would elevate his agency to a Cabinet-level
Department of the Environment.
   The Bush speech before the 60-nation Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change on Monday was the president's most broad-ranging to
date on his views of what should be done about the expected warming
of the Earth as a result of increasing pollution, especially carbon
dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
   Environmentalists immediately denounced the remarks.
   ``The was more talk in the speech about economics than the
environment,' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, calling the
president's remarks ``a gross disappointment.''

<HEAD>Kohl Demands Talks on Monetary Union With East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called
today for immediate talks with East Germany on combining their
currencies in an effort to stop people from fleeing the
economically crippled Communist nation.
   Kohl made the announcement during a meeting with leading
politicians of his Christian Democratic Union and the allied
Christian Social Union. He said details will be worked out when
East German Premier Hans Modrow visits Bonn next week.
   Discussions on using West Germany's robust currency to revive,
replace or reinforce the comparatively puny East German mark have
grown more intense as the Communist country's economy nears
collapse.
   Earlier today, the influential president of West Germany's
central bank said it was too early for a monetary union that would
make the West German mark East Germany's currency.
   Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also said he is
opposed to the idea of introducing the West German mark as a
parallel official currency in East Germany. He spoke to reporters
after talks in East Berlin with Horst Kaminski, president of the
East German central bank.
   The East German economy has been crippled by a continuing exodus
of skilled workers to West Germany, strikes and abstenteeism. More
than 50,000 East Germans moved West in January alone, joining more
than 340,000 others who resettled in West Germany last year.
   East German economic output is expected to drop by between 4
percent and 5 percent this year, the government says. East Germany
has asked West Germany for immediate aid of up to $8.8 billion, but
a West German spokesman has called the request ``unrealistic.''
   East Germans are impatient with the pace of reform and have been
drawn to the West by the prospect of earning valuable West German
marks instead of the inconvertible East German marks.
   Poehl said the East German mark would have to be made gradually
convertible before monetary reform is achieved.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was quoted as
saying today that the West German mark could become a ``parallel
currency'' in East Germany as early as this year, if the East
German government is willing to take such a step.
   Haussmann said the step was needed to stem the exodus to the
West, according to the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper.
   But central bank officials have taken a far more cautious
approach on monetary union, stressing that major economic reforms
must be undertaken first by the East German government.
   In Davos, Switzerland, Wolfgang Berghofer, mayor of the East
German city of Dresden, today proposed making the East German mark
convertible as ``the only way to avoid a complete collapse'' of the
East German economy.
   Berghofer said the quickest route to make the East German
currency convertible would be to link it to the West German mark at
a fixed rate of four East German marks to one West German one.
   Speaking to reporters, Berghofer said ``hopelessness and
desperation'' prevailed in East Germany and warned that the country
only has ``a matter of days'' to give its citizens a measure of
reassurance to avert an even larger exodus in the spring.
   Berghofer was in Davos attending an international economic forum.
   Late Monday, about 100,000 people rallied in Leipzig, with many
speakers and demonstrators calling for quick reunification, the
official news agency ADN reported.
   ADN said a group of ultra-rightist Republicans from West Germany
joined the rally, marching with their arms raised in the Nazi
salute.

   Reilly appeared before the committee to endorse bipartisan

   Bush's speech before the 60-nation Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change was the most broad-ranging to date on his views of
what should be done about the expected warming of the Earth as a
result of increasing pollution, especially carbon dioxide from the
burning of fossil fuels.
   Environmentalists immediately denounced the remarks.
   ``The was more talk in the speech about economics than the
environment,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, calling the
president's remarks ``a gross disappointment.''
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., a frequent critic of the
administration's environmental record, accused the president of
``moving as slow as molasses'' on concerns by many scientists that
manmade pollution accumulating in the atmosphere threatens to
significantly warm the Earth by the middle of the next century.
   ``What we're hearing is talk of another year of waiting. I
expected a lot more concern about the (global warming) problem,''
said Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources Institute.
   Bush, speaking to the 60-nation Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, said, ``Our policies must be consistent with
economic growth.'' He complained that in some areas of the debate
over the greenhouse effect, ``politics and opinion have outpaced
the science.''
   ``Our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to
emerging scientific knowledge _ and a reconciling of environmental
protection to the continued benefits of economic development,'' the
president said, promising to convene a White House conference on
global warming in the spring.
   James Tripp, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
Bush failed to demonstrate ``the political will necessary to make
the United States a leader in the effort to prevent global
warming.''
   But Tom Lambrix, head of the Global Climate Coalition, an
industry group, called Bush's view of global warming ``an
appropriate balance.''
   ``We need a better understanding of the economic and social
implications'' of dealing with global warming, said Lambrix,
director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Co.
   The United Nations-sponsored conference of technical experts is
meeting to work on a proposed treaty to deal with global warming.
   Reilly issued a statement saying the president's remarks ``made
clear his determination to lead the world in addressing global
climate change.''
   Bush does not believe it is ``time for a call to arms'' on
global warming, but instead favors continued research, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after the president's
remarks.
   But many environmentalists argue there is enough scientific
evidence to warrant a commitment from the United States and other
industrial nations to reduce global warming gases, especially
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
   Scientists fear such an accumulation of manmade pollutants will
act like a greenhouse, trapping heat and reflecting it back to
earth, causing a warming of the globe. Scientists disagree on how
severe the warming will become or its effect, although some
scientists predict droughts in some interior regions and coastal
flooding because of higher ocean levels.
   Reducing greenhouse gases would require less reliance on coal,
oil and natural gas and would require industry to develop more
energy-efficient automobiles and industrial plants _ which industry
fears could result in widespread economic disruption.

   A lawyer forced by the former
Communist leadership to work as a gardener after signing a key
human rights manifesto was appointed premier today of the Czech
republic.
   Petr Pithart, was named to the job during session of the Czech
National Council, parliament of one of Czechoslovakia's two
constituent republics. The other is Slovakia.
   Pithart has been the leader of the Civic Forum, an opposition
group considered to be the most influential political force during
Czechoslovakia's whirlwind revolution in November that ended 42
years of Communist dominance.
   Pithart, 49, led the Civic Forum's delegation to all the talks
of Czechoslovakia's political parties during the last two months,
hammering out the shape of the current political structure in the
country.
   Pithart is a signatory of Charter 77 _ the manifesto criticizing
Czechoslovakia's human rights record that because the foundation
for the opposition movement. A lawyer, Pithart was a veteran member
of the dissident community in Prague under the old leadership.
   He replaced as Czech premier Frantisek Pitra, who resigned last
week as the last of the old-guard Communist leaders.
   Pitra, 57, was linked to the orthodox Communist leadership that
took over after a Warsaw Pact invasion crushed 1968 reforms and was
swept from power late last year.
   However, he survived as Czech premier after revamping his
regional government to become the first in Czechoslovakia since
1948 that was not dominated by Communists. The Slovak and federal
governments followed suit shortly afterward.
   Pitra's resignation came Jan. 31, a day after the Communists
also lost their majority in the Federal Assembly, or Czechoslovak
parliament.

   A top Department of Housing and Urban
Development official acknowledged today that the federal government
was probably defrauded when a New Jersey housing authority gave its
director four salaries for four job titles.
   ``I think that's a reasonable assumption,'' Inspector General
Paul Adams told Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., as Congress resumed its
investigation of the troubled federal housing system.
   Lantos, chairman of the House Government Operations employment
and housing subcommittee, said the report on the Passaic, N.J.,
Housing Authority would be a ``starting point for hearings on
abuses and mismanagement'' in the use of federal funds by local
authorities.
   ``We happen to be dealing with New Jersey, but we are not
singling out New Jersey,'' Lantos said.
   He questioned how the executive director of the Passaic Housing
Authority, Paul Marguglio, could ``find enough hours in the day to
perform two full-time jobs and two part-time jobs ... and still
have enough time left over to earn $47,115 for time-and-a-half
compensatory pay.''
   A January audit of the Passaic authority said Marguglio had been
paid salaries totaling $245,000 in 1988.
   A. Paul Kane, the regional inspector general who wrote the
report, said Passaic officials defended Marguglio's multiple job
titles, saying ``the work has been completed.''
   The subcommittee last year heard revelations on the
multi-billion-dollar scandal of influence-peddling, fraud and
mismanagement at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   The subcommittee's findings prompted Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to ask a federal court last week to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate fraud allegations against Pierce
and other HUD officials.
   On Monday, at the panel's first hearing since October, the
former director of HUD's office of insured multi-family housing
development refused to testify, becoming the fifth former official
to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination
before the subcommittee.
   James Hamernick had been questioned about his dealings with
another former HUD official, Lance Wilson, once an aide to then-HUD
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Wilson quit his HUD job to become a housing consultant for an
investment firm. In that position, he wined and dined Hamernick.
   The audit of the Passaic housing authority also outlined nearly
$1 million in unacceptable agency expenses.
   Passaic housing officials maintain the HUD office in Newark,
N.J., approved their budgets and was aware Marguglio held multiple
job titles.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Jan. 22 suspended Marguglio and
four other Passaic officials after the audit was released. Kemp
also authorized a strike force to examine housing authorities
across New Jersey.
   Marguglio and his wife declined an invitation to testify at
today's hearing. If they do not agree to appear voluntarily at a
second session, the subcommittee will consider subpoenaing them,
said congressional aides.
   Three of Passaic's suspended housing officials _ August C.
Michaelis, chief counsel to the agency; Peter Marrocco, the
authority's chairman, and William P. Scruggs, the board's vice
chairman _ declined to testify today but may be willing to appear
later, Lantos said.
   A federal judge in Newark last week gave HUD control of the
authority, allowing the federal government to temporarily oversee
its operations and protect its records. At the same time, three of
the suspended officials filed papers seeking reinstatement.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee charged today that the Bush administration's $292.1
billion defense budget fails ``to match the new political realities
at home or abroad.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the administration's argument that
it needs a modernized force to get a U.S.-Soviet agreement on
reducing strategic weapons no longer holds true.
   ``You can get an arms control agreement without a robust''
strategic budget, Aspin said, noting economic pressures in the
Soviet Union to reduce defense spending and congressional
opposition to the administration's proposed increase in strategic
programs.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that without a strong
strategic budget, the United States might get a poor agreement that
would not serve its best interests.
   ``This administration's approach reflects old thinking rather
than these new realities,'' Aspin said. ``The problem is the budget
doesn't match the political realities at home or abroad.''
   In their third appearance before a congressional panel in less
than a week, Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, defended the administration's budget against
charges that it is a poor response to the tumultuous changes in
Eastern Europe and the diminishing Soviet threat.
   ``The notion that it is not responsive to the changes does not
hold up,'' Cheney said.
   ``There is new thinking in the Pentagon,'' Powell said.
   The defense secretary said Monday the Bush administration's plan
to modernize its strategic forces, reduce troop levels in Europe
and cancel some 20 conventional programs ``preserves the elements
of what we think is essential in terms of protecting the nation's
security.''
   The budget proposal for fiscal 1991 would allow the United
States to look back in a decade and say, ``we did in fact undertake
a build-down, a careful, orderly restructuring of our forces,''
Cheney told the Senate Budget Committee.
   Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee targeted the
administration's call for an increase in funds for several
big-ticket, strategic weapons, including the B-2 stealth bomber,
the Strategic Defense Initiative and the two land-based, nuclear
missiles.
   ``I think you're behind the power curve with regard to world
events,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Budget
Committee, told Cheney.
   The Democratic chairman questioned why the administration wants
to raise spending on SDI by nearly $1 billion to $4.5 billion, and
spend $5.5 billion for five B-2 bombers and $2.8 billion for the
multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile.
   The president's budget also includes $202 million for the
single-warhead, Midgetman missile.
   ``Why don't we wait and see what kind of world we're going to be
living in in a very short period of time rather than going ahead
and committing ourselves to these programs?'' Sasser asked.
   Cheney said the Pentagon is reviewing the strategic programs and
will decide later whether to scale them back.
   ``I inherited all these systems,'' Cheney said. ``That's what
Congress approved at the recommendation of the administration. You
have to look at each one on its merits in terms of deciding.''
   Sasser suggested that perhaps the administration should ``push
these programs off until your review is completed.''
   But a Republican on the panel, Sen. Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire, took a different approach, suggesting that an additional
increase in strategic modernization might be in order.
   ``When you have that kind of instability, you don't drop your
guard,'' he said.
   The administration also came under attack from some Democrats
for the president's plan to reduce forces in Europe to 225,000, a
cut of 80,000 from present levels.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said further reductions in troops
could result in considerable savings for the United States.
   ``I don't think we can continue to afford maintaining, nor
should we, nor do I think the threat as it's now radically changed
requires us to maintain anything like 200,000 troops in Europe,''
Riegle said.
   Cheney backed the president's total and said the only way to
realize significant savings would be to remove divisions and
demobilize forces. ``Simply bringing home a unit from Europe and
base it in the United States, you don't save very much money,'' he
said.
   Riegle interrupted: ``You do save some money. You keep the money
in the country. You fellas don't seem to understand it.''

   The government will require rural laborers
seeking work in the cities to obtain licenses, in an effort to stem
rural migration and counter rising urban unemployment, a Labor
Ministry official said.
   Vice Minister Li Peiyao said people from rural areas must have a
license from a labor department and a temporary residence permit
from police before being allowed to take city jobs, the official
China Daily said Tuesday.
   Li said the measures were aimed at preventing a mass exodus of
rural laborers from further burdening overcrowded urban labor
markets.
   China officially put urban unemployment at about 3 percent at
the end of 1989, up from 2 percent a year earlier as a government
austerity plan halted construction projects and slowed down the
economy.
   A year ago, millions of rural unemployed flocked to cities
looking for scarce jobs in construction and factories, contributing
to rising health, crime and housing problems. More than 2.5 million
converged on Canton alone.
   China has always required people seeking work in the cities to
have residence permits, but the regulation was often ignored in the
past when the fast-growing economy created a need for millions of
peasants to fill manual labor jobs in urban industries.
   The nation's ``floating population'' of rural people moving in
and out of cities has been estimated at 100 million.
   The official Guangming Daily reported Monday that 10 million
peasants had returned home recently as the austerity program and a
sharp economic downturn left them without jobs. It said many had
gone to work on water conservancy and other rural public works
projects, although millions more probably returned to farms, which
are plagued by a surplus of workers.

   A Negrito tribesman scavanging an
artillery range for spent shells was killed during a live-fire
exercise by U.S. Marines, officials said Tuesday.
   The body of Ben Fapauan, 23, was discovered Monday about 4,500
yards inside the boundary of the Wild Horse Creek training range in
Zambales province, about 70 miles west of Manila, according to a
Philippine military report and the U.S. Navy at Subic Bay naval
base.
   Preliminary reports from a joint Philippine-U.S. military panel
found that Fapauan was an ``unauthorized scavenger who
intentionally evaded range safety personnel and hid from range
safety observers during a scheduled live-fire exercise.''
   Fapauan was last seen Sunday when he entered the range to
collect spent shells and unexploded projectiles, the Philippine
military said. The shells are sold as scrap and the projectiles are
sold to fishermen.
   A search was conducted when he failed to return Monday, and his
body was found with multiple wounds inflicted by a 105mm howitzer
cannon, it added. It added that residents had been warned about the
practice two weeks ago.
   An investigation is continuing.

   A 1988 poem by Emperor Hirohito was read Tuesday at
an imperial poetry reading party, the first since his death in
January 1989.
   Such parties are an annual New Year fixture, but the 1989 party
was canceled because of Hirohito's illness, and the 1990 party was
postponed because of a one-year mourning period following his death.
   The 31-syllable traditional tanka poems were on the theme ``fine
weather.'' Hirohito's described the scenery around an imperial
villa in Nasu, northeast of Tokyo, where he stayed in the summer of
1988. The 87-year-old emperor fell ill in September 1988 with
cancer.
   A poem by his son, Emperor Akihito, told of maple leaves turning
red in the changing season as he visited his ailing father.
   Prince Aya, second son of Akihito, wrote of early morning winter
fog at Oxford University in Britain, where he is attending school.

<HEAD>Kennel Fined in Beagles Suffocation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A magistrate Tuesday fined a British kennel
$22,100 for the deaths of 79 beagles it was shipping to a Swedish
pharmaceutical firm.
   The dogs suffocated in a truck trailer aboard the ferry Tor
Britannia in the North Sea on Sept. 5.
   Perrycroft Farm Kennels, which breeds animals for scientific
research, had pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary
suffering to 100 beagles during the 24-hour ferry trip from
Harwich, England to Goteborg, Sweden.
   The 8-month-old beagles were being shipped to the Astra
pharmaceutical company in Sodertalje, south of Stockholm, for use
in testing drugs, said Astra spokesman Staffan Ternby.
   Five hours after the vessel left Harwich the truck driver, Henry
Stevens, found that only 21 beagles were alive, and 10 of them
unconscious.
   The temperature in the container was 95 degrees Fahrenheit,
Swedish police said.
   The British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which
prosecuted the kennel, said the trailer was nearly airtight and
unsuited for animals.
   The company denied a charge of loading the beagles in a vehicle
inadequate for transporting them. A further charge is pending
against Monock Freight, which provided the truck.
   The 21 surviving beagles were placed as pets in Swedish homes,
Ternby said.
   The dogs were spared after the West German newspaper
Bild-Zeitung appealed to readers to call the company in protest.
   The animals usually are given lethal injections after 18 months
of observation on the side-effects of experimental drugs, Ternby
said. Astra specializes in drugs for the heart, stomach and the
central nervous system.

<HEAD>Inefficiency Threatens China's Economic Retrenchment Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inefficiency, waste and poor returns are
threatening China's policy of making large state-run industries the
vanguard of the nation's economic development, an official report
said Tuesday.
   The government report, quoted in the official media, sounded one
of the first notes of pessimism about a three-year retrenchment
program aimed at reviving central controls, giving priority to
state-run industries and slowing down market-oriented reforms.
   Per capita productivity rose only 1.6 percent in 1989, compared
with 9.3 percent in 1988, while wages increased 14 percent and
bonuses 23 percent, according to the report.
   Production costs of state-run industrial firms covered by the
central government budget jumped 22.4 percent, a result of rising
wage and material bills, and 19 percent of state-backed enterprises
were operating in the red, compared with 13 percent in 1988.
   The State Statistics Bureau said taxes and profit turnover from
state-owned industry rose only 0.2 percent in 1989.
   The Communist Party's official People's Daily quoted Finance
Minister Wang Bingqian as saying the retrenchment program started
in 1988 must increase economic benefits.
   ``If in the course of rectification economic benefits still do
not rise, then you cannot say the aim of rectification has been
completed,'' he said.
   The official China Daily, in a commentary, noted that if
efficiency in large state-owned firms continues to erode, ``no
matter how the government adjusts, the economic retrenchment
program would fail to achieve its purpose.''
   The government, led by conservative Premier Li Peng, has
insisted China won't veer from its socialist system relying on
state-run enterprises and giving only a supplemental role to
collective and private businesses.
   But the figures showed that state firms, long-troubled by
inefficiency, surplus labor forces and poor management, are costing
the state a huge amount of money.
   Finance Vice Minister Chi Haibin told the weekly Beijing Review
the government must budget $19 billion a year to cover business
losses and subsidies, about one-third of annual financial
expenditures.
   The China Daily quoted a Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
economist as saying industrial efficiency has been declining since
1985, and that in 1988 enterprises' contributions to state revenue
was only 20.63 percent of state funding for industry, compared with
24.2 percent in 1984.
   The economist said aggregate financial losses incurred by
money-losing enterprises grew from $723 million in 1984 to $2.5
billion in 1988.
   The daily said inefficiency and low productivity were due to
slowness in adapting to new market situations, low levels of
technology, and blind expansion during years of rapid economic
growth.
   It quoted former State Economic Commission Minister Lu Dong as
saying that more than 30 percent of the nation's processing
industry is idle, a result of overcapacity and the 18-month-old
austerity program that has meant weakened demand and a cutoff of
government credit.
   The government report said newly granted state loans to industry
totaled $39.4 billion last year, exceeding the planned quota of $34
billion.
   Two-thirds of the new loans were issued in the last quarter of
the year. The last quarter is traditionally the main lending
season, but this trend was more pronounced last year as the
government, concerned by the first negative growth rates in
industrial output in a decade, eased up on its tight credit policy.

<TEXT>
   Despite lifting martial law, Chinese
authorities persist in arresting peaceful dissenters and are
carrying out new death sentences, the human rights group Asia Watch
alleged in a report obtained Tuesday.
   The Washington-based group also criticized the Bush
administration for ``kowtowing'' to the Chinese and it attempts to
``patch things up with those responsible for the slaughter and
arrests following the June 4 crackdown.''
   Asia Watch said tens of thousands of dissenters are languishing
in cramped jail cells where guards regularly torture them. It said
all political detainees are denied access to a lawyer as they await
trial and are interrogated.
   ``China's criminal justice system is among the most deeply
flawed in the word,'' the report said. ``Indeed, it is essentially
pre-modern.''
   Asia Watch also accused Chinese authorities of harassing many of
the 40,000 Chinese students studying in the United States. It
printed one letter from a Chinese student who claimed security
forces went to his parents' house in Henan province and demanded a
recent letter he had sent them regarding the June 4 crackdown.
   After an all-night interrogation, his brother gave police the
letter and police later investigated his family and previous
letters, Asia Watch said.
   The 89-page report lists many political trials and executions
occurring after the crackdown in June, although it does not supply
any new information as all of its findings are based on Western
press reports.
   It says most of the estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people still in
jail for taking part in the pro-democracy movement are workers who,
unlike many intellectuals and students, ``have no contact whatever
with the outside world.''
   The report, titled ``Punishment Season,'' said that despite the
lifting of martial law in January, the political climate throughout
the country remains repressive. It charges that many People's
Liberation Army soldiers have simply traded uniforms to the
paramilitary People's Armed Police. It also charges that the
People's Armed Police has increased in strength.
   The human rights group said it had documented several dozen
arrests and trials between October and January, including one man
who was convicted of ``counterrevolution'' for painting
pro-democracy slogans. It said it had received reports but not
confirmation of hundreds more.
   It charges that several executions had occurred of men the
Chinese called ``hooligans,'' who were killed for participating in
the movement for freedom.
   ``To sum up,'' it said, ``the continuing arrests and executions
in China form the cutting edge of a protracted, government-led
campaign of punitive repression, and they serve a purely political
purpose.''
   The report devotes one section to criticizing the response of
the Bush administration to China.
   A month after the crackdown began, President Bush sent National
Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft on a secret mission to Beijing.
Scowcroft returned to China in December.
   Bush responded to criticism of his policy by saying he did not
want to isolate China.
   Asia Watch accused the U.S. government of ``cleaving to a flawed
and outmoded strategic analysis which holds the maintenance of
close ties with China to be the key to any successful containment
of Soviet expansionism.''
   It said such a policy has ``reverted to a shabby double standard
insofar as the question of human rights in China.''
   The Asia Watch report follows the completion of a study by the
U.S. State Department on human rights abuses in China. According to
press reports, the study says the ``massacre'' in Beijing and
subsequent crackdown violated almost every internationally
recognized human right.
   The State Department report will be released later this month.

<HEAD>After 20 Months, Odor Report Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This won't come as any surprise to
people who live here, but Jacksonville stinks.
   So says a grand jury report that has been under wraps for 20
months because of objections by four corporations to its findings.
It was unsealed Monday by order of an appeals court after a
challenge by The Florida Times-Union.
   The report found that odors from Jacksonville's paper mills and
other plants are an embarrassment and that industry has failed to
police itself.
   The 23-member grand jury also found that the odors have hurt
property values and interfere with residents' health and enjoyment.
   At the same time, the panel indicted four industries on
air-pollution charges. But the charges since have either been
dropped or struck down.
   The four industries were SCM Glidco Organics Corp., Jefferson
Smurfit Corp., Seminole Kraft Corp. and Union Camp Corp.
   The report was released after an eight-month investigation
requested by Mayor Tommy Hazouri.
   George Robbins, president of SCM Glidco, said his company fought
release of the report because it is ``grossly biased, factually
deficient and very misleading to the general public.''
   State Attorney Ed Austin said he was not surprised that the
industries fought release of the report so vigorously.
   ``It's been a mentality that they could wear us out and beat us
down and not comply. We're showing the world we're going to stay at
it until we accomplish our objectives, and that is to breathe fresh
air,'' he said.
   The grand jury concluded that if industries fail to get rid of
the stink, city, state and federal officials should pursue civil
and criminal remedies.

   Riots broke out between two rival
political parties Tuesday, and 22 people were injured, police and
hospital sources said.
   The army was called in to patrol affected areas and police said
tension remained in some neighborhoods.
   The unrest began as supporters of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement,
representing Moslem immigrants to Pakistan, carried the bodies of
two students killed Monday. The movement has blamed the killings on
supporters of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party.
   Members of the movement converged on a police station Tuesday
demanding the arrest of several party officials for the murder of
two students. When police declined to act against senior party
officials in the case, the movement's supporters erected roadblocks
and pelted police with rocks.
   Police opened fire to disperse the crowd, and some protesters
shot back. Eight people, including three police officers, were
injured.
   Trouble rapidly spread to other parts of the city and another 14
people, all belonging to the movement, were injured, police said.
   The Pakistan Peoples Party is supported by Sindh nationalists,
while the Mohajir Qaumi Movement represents immigrants from India
after Pakistan's independence in 1947.
   Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands injured in
ethnic clashes between the Sindh nationalists, who want greater
autonomy, and Mohajirs, who want to be recognized as a fifth ethnic
group.

   Nelson Mandela called
President F.W. de Klerk's concessions to the anti-apartheid
movement ``courageous'' but does not believe they will lead to
talks between guerrillas and the government, a Mandela associate
said today.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, met with Mandela today.
   Later, Boesak said the jailed African National Congress leader
described de Klerk's speech on Friday _ during which he legalized
the ANC and lifted many emergency restrictiosn _ as ``bold,
couragous and hopeful.''
   But Mandela does not believe the speech cleared the way for
negotiations, Boesak said. He ``has not given up on any of his
principles,'' Boesak added.
   He also said that although Mandela has presented demands to the
government, he will accept freedom whether or not they are met.
   ``His release is not in his own hands,'' Boesak said. ``It is
the responsibility of the South African government to release him.''
   Earlier, his wife, Winnie Mandela, had indicated that Mandela
had demanded a complete lifting of the state of emergency as a
condition of his release.
   Boesak said Mandela wants the government to end the 3{-year-old
state of emergency and release all political prisoners, including
guerrillas convicted of acts of violence.
   If these conditions are not met, Mandela would still agree to
leave prison, ``but he will state his unhappiness with the
government,'' Boesak said.
   Cabinet ministers said today Mandela will be released ``very
soon'' but that the date hasn't been decided yet.
   Earlier today Walter Sisulu, an ANC leader who was freed in
October after 26 years in prison, said the ANC has no intention of
starting negotiations with the government and called on de Klerk to
make further reforms.
   He said the ANC would pursue its guerrilla campaign despite de
Klerk's decision to legalize the group, which had been banned since
1960.
   In his speech Friday, de Klerk lifted bans or restrictions on
more than 60 anti-apartheid groups, promised to free Mandela and
many other political prisoners, ended restrictions on 374
anti-government activists, and declared a moratorium on hangings.
   The actions met most, but not all of the ANC's conditions for
opening talks with the white-led government. De Klerk did not say
he would accept the principle of one-man, one-vote.
   De Klerk said ANC members can return from exile and will not be
arrested unless they have been accused of committing ordinary
crimes. However, the government has not said who among the ANC's
estimated 15,000 members in exile will be liable for prosecution.
   Sisulu said no ANC exiles will return until the government
clarifies its position. He also said the group would formally
establish offices in South Africa, but declined to specify a date.
   Meanwhile, opposition among right-wing whites to de Klerk's
concessions continued to grow. On Monday, Andries Treurnicht, the
Conservative Party leader, said South Africa's whites faced ``the
hour of truth.''
   His party, which won 31 percent of the white vote in September,
applied for a permit for a mass march in Pretoria on Feb. 15 to
launch a ``freedom struggle'' aimed at protecting whites from
domination by the black majority.
   Several far-right groups have vowed to resist de Klerk's
reforms. Fears of an extremist blacklash increased after an attack
Sunday on the British Embassy in Pretoria.
   Five whites were arrested recently on suspicion of planning
attacks against de Klerk and other government leaders as well as
anti-apartheid activists.
   Most right-wing whites are Afrikaners. Primarily of Dutch
descent, they began settling in South Africa more than 300 years
ago and now account for 60 percent of the 5 million whites. There
are about 28 million blacks.

   A 69-year-old man was robbed of his money,

   State Police investigator Bob Buckley spotted Emmette McGough in

   McGough gave Buckley descriptions of the two robbers, and within

   McGough, who lives in Monroe, said he had parked his truck in
the driveway so he could hunt in nearby woods. When he returned,
two men carrying sawed-off shotguns jumped out of the house, struck
him in the head and tied him up, stealing his truck, Buckley said.
   McGough was treated for a cut on the head and tested for a

   A judge dismissed charges Tuesday against
two Ugandan journalists accused of defaming President Kenneth
Kaunda of Zambia, but both remained in custody.
   A Kampala magistrate threw out the charges against Festo Ebongu
of the government-owned newspaper New Vision and Alfred Okware of
the independent monthly magazine Newsdesk.
   The government's defamation charges against the two stemmed from
questions they asked Kaunda at a Jan. 29 news conference as he was
ending a state visit to Uganda.
   Okware asked Kaunda why he didn't consider stepping down as
president after 25 years in office. Ebongu asked Kaunda to explain
why Zambia's national airline flies from Johannesburg to New York
when the president is in the forefront of those calling for
sanctions against South Africa.
   Magistrate Hensley Ephrahim Okalebo dismissed the counts after
defense attorneys pointed out that the statute under which they
were brought requires the publication of a defamation.
   Okaware, however, was ordered held on another charge of being in
possession of a seditious article and Ebongu was arrested again
without charge by security police as he was leaving the court.

trying to have her killed last Mother's Day.
   Kevin Wilson, clutching a Bible and tissue, wept as he told U.S.
District Judge Odell Horton on Monday that he and his wife wanted
to reconcile.
   ``Our decision is to restore our family,'' said Wilson, a former

   Investigators said Wilson, 30, tried to hire a killer and
planned to collect $220,000 on his wife's life insurance policy.
The plan unraveled when a woman whom Wilson asked to help find a
hit man went to the police instead.
   Wilson was upset about his wife's weight after she gave birth
two years ago, said his attorney, Mark McDaniel.
   Prosecutor Dan Newsom told the judge that Mrs. Wilson ``doesn't
believe he wanted to have her murdered, but the government is 100
percent sure that he wanted her dead.''
   Wilson pleaded guilty in September to using the telephone and
the mail to try to solicit a murder.

<DATELINE>SHAW, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A municipal judge has fined the fire chief
$100 after he refused to apologize for allegedly making noises and
faces during a Board of Aldermen meeting.
   ``If I was wrong, I'd apologize. But I'm not wrong. I was right.
I won't apologize,'' Chief Kenneth Pirtle said Monday night after
Municipal Judge Kenneth Thomas found him guilty of disturbing the
peace.
   Pirtle said he intended to appeal the decision to Bolivar County
Court. The fire chief remains free on $150 bond pending appeal.
   Thomas told Pirtle that he would waive the fine ``for the sake
of the citizens of Shaw'' if Pirtle would apologize in court or at
the regularly scheduled board meeting Tuesday night.
   Mayor Gregory Flippins and two of the town's five aldermen,
Diana Drake and Herman Love, testified that the fire chief made
noises and faces as he left the board meeting on Jan. 2. They also
accused Pirtle of calling the mayor names.
   ``He made a sound ... like a blubbering sound, like a person is
making when they're sticking their tongue out of their mouth. A
gagging type,'' Flippins testified. ``He turned around at the door,
stuck his tongue out, making a blabbering sound and wagging his
tongue.''
   Drake also testified the Pirtle ``stuck his hands in his ears
and said, `Oooh-ooh,'' a remark that drew giggles from those in the
courtroom.
   Pirtle and three volunteer firefighters in this town of 2,500
residents, disputed that testimony. Public Works Director Evereth
Stanton, also a volunteer firefighter, testified he didn't see who
made the noise.
   Pirtle also denied calling the mayor names.

<HEAD>New York State Moves to Protect Tasty Turtles</HEAD>

   The terrapin is a gourmet delicacy and key
soup ingredient to some, a noble creature and wonderful pet to
others, but to state environmental officials it's a threatened
species that needs protection.
   The turtle's salt water habitat is imperiled by development and
its ranks are declining because of its regained popularity on some
dinner tables.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation recently
issued regulations setting up a ``terrapin harvest,'' or hunting
season, for diamondback terrapin.
   Under the regulations, would-be terrapin hunters must buy state
licenses, and terrapin capturing is forbidden during the turtles'
nesting period in May, June and July. The regulations also set
minimum and maximum size limits on captured terrapin.
   ``We think that because of loss of habitat and loss of nesting
areas, in addition to a continued desire to eat them, primarily
with the ethnic groups and gourmet restaurants, its survival could
become a problem again,'' said Alvin Breisch, a state wildlife
biologist.
   This isn't the first time the turtles have been threatened by
their own good taste, said Breisch.
   ``They were completely wiped out in many locations in the early
1900s,'' said Breisch. ``The food fad kind of died off about the
same time the turtles died off. But they've been slowly coming
back.''
   In New York state, the terrapins are found only in the brackish,
salty water off Long Island and at the mouth of the Hudson River.
   The DEC doesn't keep a terrapin tally, Breisch said.
   ``We don't know how many there are, but they're certainly not as
numerous as they were 100 years ago,'' he said.
   Jim VanAbbema can see evidence of a decline just by going to a
fish market. He's a member of the New York State Turtle and
Tortoise Society, which petitioned the DEC to regulate terrapin
capture.
   ``Many of our members had been alarmed by the quantity of
diamondback terrapin that were sold in Chinatown and other fish
markets across the city,'' said VanAbbema, editor of the
20-year-old society's newsletter, Plastron Papers. The plastron is
a turtle's bottom shell.
   They're not very big turtles, seldom growing to more than 9
inches long. Their scutes _ the individual pieces that make up
their shells _ have very elaborate, concentric patterns. A
distinctive mark on a terrapin's face makes it look like it has
white lips, Breisch said.
   ``If you see the turtle, it basks in the open water rather than
crawling up on logs or sitting on the beach, it basks just by
floating on the surface and it sticks its head up and you'll see
the w hite lips. If you see that, you'll know it's a terrapin,'' he
said.
   Terrapins are not aggressive, make good pets and can live 30 or
40 years, said VanAbbema.
   Some of the turtle society's 1,000 members are also concerned
about the conditions in which the turtles are kept after capture,
said VanAbbema, who owns 18 turtles and a parrot.
   ``They are kept at best in a dry tank, maybe two or three layers
deep, sometimes even worse,'' he said. ``They are often in a
diseased state ... they are in very poor health because of the
extreme stress of being without food or water for weeks or longer.''
   The fact that turtles must be butchered shortly before cooking
should contribute to their continued existence, said Breisch.
   ``Whoever buys them has to take them home and kill them and
clean them,'' said Breisch. ``Turtle meat doesn't last very long
after it's been killed, just like lobster meat.
   ``I think that discourages a lot of people. They actually
wouldn't want to kill it themselves.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to end the
Communist Party's monopoly of power was an effort to keep ahead of
a political avalanche that was threatening to bury him, say U.S.
analysts.
   Changing Article Six of the Soviet constitution to deprive the
Communist Party of its guaranteed ``leading role,'' as proposed
Monday by Gorbachev, would ratify rather than unite opposition
groups scattered among the 15 Soviet republics, the analysts
predicted.
   But there was no clear consensus on the question of Gorbachev's
survival
   In the West, where Gorbachev's popularity is high, his proposal
``will be interpreted as a show of great skill, to enable him to
prevail,'' said Adam Ulam of Harvard University. ``But he is really
trying to keep up with a bolting horse.''
   ``Of course he has to survive, in the lack of any alternative.
The right does not want to take a chance at cataclysm, by removing
him,'' said Ulam. ``If they announced tomorrow that Gorbachev was
out, you would have demonstrations in every Russian city,'' and
that would force an unwanted test for the Red Army and KGB security
forces.
   A crowd estimated at 200,000 marched through Red Square last
weekend demanding more democracy, an indication of the growing
pressure on Kremlin leaders to hand over more power to the people.
   Gorbachev's chances of success are mixed, said Jerry Hough, a
Duke University analyst who has described the Soviet leader's
political position as strong, but he said the latest development is
forcing him to reconsider.
   If the Communist Party's constitutional grip on power is
removed, said Hough, ``there is no reason it should not have the
result it did in Eastern Europe,'' where Communists are being
forced from power.
   Gorbachev may be planning to surrender his job as general
secretary of the Communist Party, traditionally the top Kremlin
post, and concentrate on his role as president, an office which he
has strengthened since taking over the party in March 1985.
   But Gorbachev may be miscalculating popular pressure toward more
democracy and underestimating the backlash among Russians who are
angered by three things, the collapse of the economy, the weakening
of the East European alliance, and separatist movements in the
non-Russian republics, said Hough.
   ``If Gorbachev in five years has done nothing but give up
Eastern Europe and create economic chaos, why shouldn't one decide
that he is not worthy of running a great country?'' said Hough.
   The Communist Party faces a test at the ballot box in local
elections in the Soviet republics in February and March. The
results promise to be just as embarrassing as those from national
balloting last year, when many Communist functionaries were
defeated in Russia, and popular fronts won majorities in the three
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   The Communists are expected to lose again in the Baltics, as
well as Moldavia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, said Leon Aron,
a Soviet-born scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation in
Washington.
   Aron predicted that depriving the Communist Party of its
guaranteed leading role will cause it to ``collapse. I give it half
a year. It could take longer.''
   The Communists will be convulsed for months by the elections and
by preparations for a party congress, which had been scheduled for
October but which Gorbachev now wants in late June, apparently
immediately after his planned summit in Washington with President
Bush.
   The likely embarrassment of the elections and the expected
foreign policy success of the summit may strengthen Gorbachev's
hand at the Communist Party congress, where he will have his first
chance in more than four years to clear his conservative opponents
off the policy-making Central Committee. It was at a meeting of the
249-member Central Committee that Gorbachev proposed amending
Article Six, and thus sparked a conservative firestorm.

<HEAD>Pardon Sought for Man Serving Life Prison Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The district attorney is seeking a pardon for a
49-year-old man who has spent five years in prison for an armored
car robbery that police now say he did not commit.
   The man, Martin Kimsey, wrote a letter that set in motion a
chain of events that led investigators to another man.
   ``I used to think everybody in prison was guilty and just saying
they were innocent, until it happened to me,'' said Kimsey, who
goes to court Wednesday for a hearing that could lead to his
freedom.
   If District Judge Larry Baraka sets bail, Kimsey will be free
for the first time since 1985, when he was arrested for the robbery
of a Wells Fargo armored-car driver in the Dallas suburb of Garland.
   Kimsey read a newspaper account of similar robberies and wrote a
letter in 1987 to one of the men convicted of them, asking the team
to admit to the Garland robbery. Kimsey got no response, but
prosecutors got a call late last year from the wife of one of the
men saying he wanted to confess to a crime someone else was jailed
for.
   ``I guess he sat on the letter or didn't do anything about it
until he decided to talk to the FBI about it,'' First District
Attorney Norman Kinne said Tuesday.
   Investigators talked to James Clayton Garrett and said he
provided details of the robbery only the robber would know. He and
Kimsey passed a lie detector test before the pardon was recommended
for Kimsey.
   Kimsey said he wrote a thank-you note to Garrett.
   Kimsey says he doesn't blame anyone for the wrongful conviction
that has cost him five years.
   ``I tell you what, when I first got arrested I was bitter at
everything,'' Kimsey told the Dallas Morning News. ``But after five
years you've got to go through everything in your mind. You can't
really change things.
   ``I don't hold a grudge. All I want to do is get out of here and
get out of Dallas,'' Kimsey said. ``I want to get my life back
together.''
   Kimsey testified that he and his brother Maurice were in Fort
Worth when the robbery occurred and that his brother's car, whose
make and color matched a car seen at the robbery, was in a body
shop.
   A Dallas jury convicted Kimsey in 1985. Kimsey, who had a record
stemming from forgery and robbery charges, was sentenced to life in
prison.
   A grand jury refused to indict Maurice Kimsey.

<HEAD>Talks Resume, Superpowers Urged to Help Speed Global Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks on a global ban on chemical weapons resumed
Tuesday with European appeals for the United States and Soviet
Union to increase efforts toward an agreement.
   Swedish envoy Maj Britt Theorin told the 40-nation Conference on
Disarmament that long-running negotiations on a convention could be
completed within a year.
   But in thinly veiled criticism of U.S. policy, Theorin said a
``glaring loophole'' would result from proposals to allow states to
keep some chemical weapons until all countries with a production
capability sign the planned treaty.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Den Broek said it is ``necessary
to make it crystal clear that destruction of all chemical weapons
is the principal objective'' of a convention.
   ``We do not want `haves' and `have-nots,''' he said.
   The conference, resuming full sessions after a five-month break,
also received offers from The Hague and Vienna to be the site of an
international agency for monitoring adherence to a future chemical
weapons ban.
   The conference's spring session is set to run 10 weeks.
   Difficulties over verifying the proposed ban have been one of
the main sticking points in completion of the treaty, which would
forbid the production, stockpiling and use of poison gas.
Negotiations in Geneva date back to 1968.
   Improved superpower relations have boosted progress in
5-year-old bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet
Union and spawned hopes that an international treaty might be ready
by the end of the year.
   Chief Soviet negotiator Sergei Batsanov last month described
talks as ``at a very advanced stage.'' But he added that the
superpower still disagree on an offer made by President Bush to
destroy 80 percent of stockpiles prior to the signing of an
international treaty provided Moscow follows suit.
   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly last year, Bush also
proposed to keep two percent of U.S. stockpiles of weapons until
all countries deemed capable of producing chemical weapons have
signed an international treaty.
   Without mentioning the United States, Ms. Theorin described this
plan as ``potentially crippling'' a global accord.
   She said it would leave ``a glaring loophole in the regime,
thereby providing an excuse for other countries to retain _ or to
acquire _ chemical weapons,'' the Swedish delegate said.
   About a dozen countries, including Libya and Iran, are thought
to possess chemical weapons, although only the United States and
Soviet Union admit having the deadly substances.
   Van Den Broek offered to base the treaty's monitoring agency in
The Hague, seat of the Dutch government and the World Court.
   Foreign Minister Alois Mock proposed Vienna, the headquarters of
several U.N. agencies and the venue for East-West talks on
conventional weapons.
   Theorin warned against optimism on an early signing of the
convention.
   ``We have become very familiar with the claim that the
comprehensive chemical weapons convention will be concluded soon,''
she said. ``Such statements cannot credibly be repeated forever by
diplomats, politicians and governments.''

   A GI who fled to East Germany 30 years
ago for fear a truck accident would land him in the stockade was
set free today after the Army decided against court-martialing him
as a deserter.
   ``I'm going to live it up,'' said 53-year-old Pvt. Arnold
Kephart after his release from confinement at Fort Sill. ``And then
I'm going to sit down and try to work my way in life as I did
before.''
   Kephart was arrested last week upon arriving in Omaha, Neb., to
see his family for the first time since he fled to the Communist
bloc in 1960. About 30 family members were waiting at the airport,
but only two got to speak to him.
   Instead of a court-martial, the Army today granted Kephart's
request for an other-than-honorable discharge. He had been held at
the Army base since Thursday and was to fly to Nebraska later today
for a family reunion.
   ``I don't know how I'm going to say it, but I'll say I'm proud
to be back in the United States,'' Kephart told reporters outside
Fort Sill.
   Kephart took refuge behind the Iron Curtain after an Army truck
he had been driving on an assignment to France crashed while he was
returning to his base in Heidelberg, West Germany. The truck also
contained three corked bottles of French wine, he said.
   ``In the crash, the wine got broke up on our uniforms. The
police, they thought that we had been drunk. ... We didn't have one
single drink from the wine,'' Kephart told the Omaha World-Herald
on Monday. Kephart said French police locked them up, and the
soldier's superiors took them into custody.
   ``They told me that I would get prison, I would so many years
locked up and then I would have to pay for that rig. They told me a
lot of things,'' Kephart said.
   ``After they told me things, I waited till I got my chance and I
went over the barbed wire.''
   Kephart tried several times to escape to the West but was caught
each time at the border, said his attorney, James Martin Davis. He
decided to return to the United States after East Germany opened
its borders late last year, Davis said.
   The other-than-honorable discharge means Kephart will be
eligible for virtually no veterans benefits, said base spokeswoman
Sheila Samples.
   Kephart said today he would probably spend five or six weeks
with family in Council Bluffs, Iowa, across the Missouri River from
Omaha. After that, he said, he will probably go to Texas with his
sister.
   Kephart brought his 12-year-old son, Frank, with him. His
ex-wife, Brigitte, and his twin 8-year-old daughters, Kathleen and
Katharina, remain in Schmalkalden, East Germany.

   The Maritime Safety Agency said Tuesday it has
arrested the captain of a 7,027-ton Liberian freighter that struck
a rock off western Japan last week and spilled much of its cargo of
fuel oil.
   Capt. Cheung Wai Kay, 39, of Hong Kong, was accused of
professional negligence, for which the maximum penalty is three
years in prison, said an offical of the agency, which is Japan's
coast guard.
   Cheung allegedly failed to take proper measures in rough seas,
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said
Cheung would appear Wednesday before prosecutors, who would decide
whether to indict him.
   The Maritime Gardenia struck the rock Jan. 25, one mile off the
coast of Kyoto prefecture, and about 650 tons of fuel oil leaked
before divers sealed pipes.
   All 23 Filipinos and Chinese crewmen were rescued.
   An official of the fishermen's cooperative in Ine village said
seaweed farming in the area, which produced $24,000 worth of
seaweed last year, was completely ruined.
   The Liberian freighter, owned by International Maritime Carriers
Co. of Hong Kong, had been heading for southwestern Yamaguchi
prefecture, about 500 miles southwest of Tokyo, after unloading
lumber in Uchiura, near Ine.

   A federal appeals judge asked government
lawyers today why Oliver North was not permitted to call former
President Reagan as a witness at North's Iran-Contra trial or
allowed to see written answers Reagan supplied to investigators.
   ``You never turned over answers from Reagan to the defendant,''
Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told
a government attorney during a hearing on North's appeal of his
conviction.
   ``Why, as a matter of basic fairness,'' wasn't North permitted
to examine written answers that Reagan supplied to a federal grand
jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair, the appeals judge asked.
   A government attorney, Gerard Lynch, told the appeals court that
the former president's written answers would not have been helpful
to North.
   But the U.S. system of justice is based on providing a defendant
with a wide range of material for possible use in his defense, said
the judge.
   ``What troubles me is we don't have a very good idea'' of what
the president's testimony would have been, said Silberman.
   North's attorney, Barry Simon, argued that Reagan should have
been called to testify to show that he authorized keeping secret
the U.S. connection to a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles
from Israel to Iran.
   Reagan's appearance had been called for at the time of North's
trial last year but the trial judge, Gerhard Gesell of U.S.
District Court, quashed a subpoena. He ruled there was no evidence
in the record to suggest that the former president authorized any
illegal activities by North.
   On Monday U.S. District Judge Harold Greene ordered Reagan to
provide videotaped testimony at the trial of former national
security adviser John Poindexter. The judge gave Reagan and
President Bush until Friday to invoke executive privilege to avoid
testimony by the former president.
   Greene also renewed his order that Reagan immediately turn over
33 diary entries to Poindexter. Reagan promptly invoked executive
privilege to avoid turning portions of his diaries over to
Poindexter.
   North was convicted on May 4, 1989, of obstructing Congress,
altering and destroying National Security Council documents and
accepting an illegal gratuity.
   Silberman said that if North had been working for the secretary
of state instead of the president, there would have been no
question that the cabinet member would have been called to testify.
   Lynch responded that North had no direct contact with Reagan and
that the former National Security Council aide formed
``impressions'' of what he was to do from his immediate boss,
Poindexter.
   ``The question is, did the jury get sufficient information to
make a judgment'' on North's guilt or innocence, Silberman said at
one point in the appeals court argument.
   North's attorneys contend Reagan's testimony would have been
critically important in North's defense aginst the obstruction
charge. The defense contends Reagan would have corroborated North's
assertion that the president and his top advisers decided that in
order to protect the lives of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon, they
wouldn't disclose U.S. involvement with the November 1985 Hawk
shipment.
   But Iran-Contra prosecutors say North was unable to identify a
single instance where Reagan directly told him to obstruct Congress.
   On another point, North's attorney asked the appeals court to
overturn the former presidential aide's conviction because of the
``pervasive dissemination'' of his congressional testimony.
   Witnesses, jurors, prosecutors and grand jurors could not avoid
exposure to testimony North gave a congressional committee
investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Simon said.
   North was granted immunity from prosecution for his
congressional testimony. Prosecutors said they had not read or seen
any of that testimony and had gathered their own evidence. The
congressional testimony was carried on live television and reported
widely throughout the media.
   ``In light of the pervasive dissemination ... there are no
procedures that could ensure a fair trial,'' Simon argued.
   He said grand jurors hearing testimony that resulted in
indictments against North were not instructed to avoid reading
newspapers or watching television. Instead, he said, the
government's special prosecutor told the grand jurors to avoid
``tainted material,'' or news that related to North.
   ``They were told they could watch, but if it came to tainted
material, then skip over it,'' said Simon. ``You could read, but
when you get to an article that is tainted, skip over.''
   He said the special prosecutor ``chose convenience'' instead of
absolutely forbidding the grand jurors from reading newspapers or
watching television.
   ``The publicity was absolutely pervasive,'' he said. ``This
grand jury was not shielded.''
   Lynch, the government's attorney, responded that North's lawyers
``are equating...exposure with taint.'' He called it ``overreaching
of what the law requires.''
   The obstruction charge involved a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles
to Iran, while the documents that were destroyed showed North's
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras. The gratuity was a $13,800
home security system which North accepted from Richard Secord, who
North enlisted to run supplies to the rebels fighting the
Nicaraguan government.
   Gesell on July 5 placed North on probation for two years, fined
him $150,000 and sentenced him to 1,200 hours of community service.
North is performing the community service while appealing the
convictions and fine.
   The three-member panel hearing his appeal includes Judges
Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle, both Reagan administration
appointees, and Carter administration appointee Patricia Wald,
chief judge of the appeals court.

   A newspaper has reported that Iran wants France to
free an imprisoned Lebanese before it will seek the release of
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Anis Naccache is serving a life term for the attempted
assissination of a former Iranian prime minister. The conservative
daily Le Figaro reported Monday that President Francois Mitterrand
may trim the sentence to 20 years, making Naccache eligible for
parole in 1991, when he will have served 10 years.
   Le Figaro, citing sources close to the Foreign Ministry, said
President Bush told Mitterrand that Iran asked for Naccache's
release as a condition for intervening with Iranian-backed
extremist groups believed holding the captives.
   ``President Bush personally telephoned Francois Mitterrand to
inform him of an unexpected change during talks that the Americans
held with Tehran to obtain the liberation of their countrymen,''
the newspaper said.
   ``The name of Naccache suddenly appeared from the Iranian
negotiators, who made the release of their protege one of the
conditions for a favorable outcome of the discussions,'' the
newspaper said.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the story was ``nonsense, total nonsense. We don't make deals
for hostages.''
   Bush asked Mitterrand whether the Naccache affair might soon be
settled, Le Figaro maintained.
   The French leader answered that ``nothing remains in the way any
longer and that the release of the American hostages could be an
extra reason to move things along,'' the newspaper said.
   Le Figaro did not specify when the conversation took place but
said Mitterrand's response had reached Beirut at the end of last
week via the United States and Tehran.
   The story was the latest report in the French press that
Naccache will be freed after he recently ended a 19-week hunger
strike protesting his imprisonment.
   Naccache and senior Iranian officials claim his release was part
of the 1988 deal that won release for all French hostages then held
in Lebanon. French officials deny that Naccache's release was part
of the package.
   The weekly newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported last week that
Mitterrand would free Naccache this year. The French leader's
promise was transmitted to Naccache by way of ``the highest Iranian
leaders,'' the newspaper said.
   Naccache's lawyer Jacques Verges, has said Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and spiritual leader Ali Khameini ordered an end
to the hunger strike, in which Naccache was kept alive by
occasional intravenous feedings.
   Mitterrand had said during the long fast that he might consider
releasing Naccache, but not under the pressure of a hunger strike.
   Naccache, born in Beirut in 1951, led an assassination squad in
a failed 1980 attack against Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's last prime
minister before the Islamic revolution of 1979. Bakhtiar was
uninjured but two other people were killed.
   At Naccache's trial two years later, both prosecution and
defense lawyers said Naccache acted under orders of senior Iranian
officials.
   Eighteen Westerners are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem groups in Lebanon, including eight Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman. Longest
held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The government is delaying the
release of Nelson Mandela to deal with his political demands and
that could jeopardize its peace initiative, an activist said
Tuesday after conferring with Mandela.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak said Mandela wants the government to lift
the state of emergency and free all political prisoners, including
those convicted of violent acts, but would accept freedom whether
or not these demands are met.
   ``His release is not in his own hands,'' Boesak said. ``It is
the responsibility of the South African government to release him.''
   If his demands aren't met, Mandela would still agree to leave
prison, ``but he will state his unhappiness with the government,''
said Boesak, who is president of the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches.
   ``If they come in here and they tell him, `We are releasing
you,' he will not hold onto the chairs and tables and kick and say
`I won't come out.' But he will warn them: `If you do release me
and the conditions that we have put have not been met, then I will
be obliged to make a statement on those conditions,''' Boesak said.
   The government has made clear it wants Mandela, the most popular
leader among South Africa's blacks, to play a conciliatory role
when he emerges after more than 27 years in prison. President F.W.
de Klerk's hopes of initiating negotiations on black-white
power-sharing could be dashed if a freed Mandela were to take a
tough stance against the government.
   Boesak said Mandela did not know when he might go free, but was
engaged in ``intense contacts'' with the government.
   ``He must be released soon or de Klerk will lose momentum,''
Boesak said after he and his wife, Dorothy, met with Mandela for
more than three hours at Victor Verster prison farm north of Cape
Town.
   De Klerk, in a speech Friday, lifted a 30-year ban on Mandela's
African National Congress movement, eased restrictions on other
opposition groups, and said Mandela, 71, would be freed soon.
   Mandela considered the speech ``bold, courageous and hopeful,''
but did not believe it had cleared the way for talks between the
government and the ANC, Boesak said.
   Mandela ``has not given up on any of his principles,'' Boesak
added. ``He is a statesman whose place is not in prison.''
   Gerrit Viljoen, the Cabinet minister assigned to open
negotiations with leaders of the voteless black majority, said
Mandela's release ``is something that is to take place very soon.''
   ``The date of his release is to be determined as a matter of
urgency,'' Viljoen said at a briefing Tuesday.
   In a later speech to Parliament, Viljoen said he envisioned
South Africa being led by a coalition of parties in 10 years, with
the long-ruling National Party no longer in charge.
   Viljoen and Foreign Minister Pik Botha challenged claims that
the government was obstructing Mandela's release by not repealing
the state of emergency or freeing all political prisoners.
   ``Don't believe people who say the government is the only
obstacle,'' said Botha. He repeated de Klerk's assertion that
Mandela's safety and personal considerations were factors behind
the delay.
   On another topic, Botha said it did not matter whether a future
president of South Africa was black or white as long as the new
political system had the support of a majority of the people.
   Walter Sisulu, an old friend of Mandela who was freed in October
after 26 years in prison, said Tuesday after returning from abroad
that the ANC leadership was not aware of Mandela setting
pre-conditions for his release.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life term
for launching the ANC's guerrilla campaign against the white
government. Government officials agree with opposition leaders that
his freedom is a key to creating a climate for negotiations on a
new constitution, ending apartheid, and giving blacks a voice in
the national government.
   However, Sisulu said, ``There is no question yet of direct
discussions with the government.'' He described de Klerk's reforms
as a ``progressive'' step, ``but unfortunately it was only a
half-measure.''
   He said the organization was still studying de Klerk's speech
and would need up to two weeks to issue a formal response.
   He said the ANC's armed struggle remained ``part and parcel'' of
its campaign for black rights because ``nothing fundamentally has
changed.''
   At the same news conference, Popo Molefe, a leader of the United
Democratic Front, said 20 leaders of the anti-apartheid coalition
would meet Mandela on Friday.

   Its members' names kept secret to guard against
tampering, a jury today began deliberating whether reputed mob boss
John Gotti ordered a union leader shot.
   The jurors got down to work after the judge in the assault trial
of the so-called Dapper Don told them, ``You have only yourselves
to answer to.''
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin also granted a defense request
and reminded jurors that the Mafia was not on trial. The judge told
the jurors that to reach a guilty verdict, they must find the
prosecution proved the crime and not simply that Gotti and his
co-defendant might be members of organized crime.
   Gotti, known as the Dapper Don for his expensive suits, is
reputed to be the boss of the Gambino crime family, the nation's
most powerful mob organization.
   McLaughlin told the jurors that that if they can face themselves
the day after the verdict and feel good about what they've done,
then they will have done their duty.
   Gotti said earlier that he wasn't worried about being convicted.
   ``There's no problem,'' Gotti said after closing arguments
Monday. ``There's never been a problem.'' When the case began, he
said odds were 3-to-1 in his favor.
   If convicted, Gotti faces 25 years to life in prison because of
his prior record.
   The jurors have been sequestered since being sworn in about
three weeks ago to shield them from publicity and possible
jury-tampering, and their names have not been disclosed. Court
officials estimate the cost of their hotel, food and transportation
at $1,200 a day.
   In closing arguments, defense lawyers Bruce Cutler and Gerald
Shargel portrayed Gotti as a noteworthy person who is being
persecuted by prosecutors because of his reputation.
   ``In their lust to convict Mr. Gotti, they created a case and
they forgot integrity,'' Cutler told jurors. ``In the Mafia
hysteria that they create and perpetuate, they forgot what was
right.''
   But the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Michael
Cherkasky, insisted Gotti had ``the motivation'' to arrange the
shooting.
   He said Gotti, 49, and co-defendant Anthony Guerrieri, 61, had
the Westies gang shoot John F. O'Connor, former vice president of
Carpenters Union Local 608, on May 7, 1986.
   According to Cherkasky, O'Connor was shot because he arranged
the trashing of a mob-run restaurant, Bankers and Brokers, which
used non-union labor.
   The defense ridiculed the quality of the prosecution's key
evidence _ hard-to-hear tapes secretly recorded in 1986 at Gotti's
hangout and in the visiting room at the Rikers Island jail.
   The defense says a key sentence, in which Gotti allegedly says,
``We're gonna, gonna bust him up,'' is inaudibe. Shargel and Cutler
contend prosecutors are making it up to suit their theory.
   The defense attorneys also asked why prosecutors didn't warn
O'Connor that his life was in danger or why Gotti wasn't indicted
in 1986 when the tapes were made.
   ``When the smoke clears, you will realize one thing _ that there
is no proof, let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that John
Gotti and Anthony Guerrieri had John O'Connor shot,'' Shargel told
the jurors.
   Cherkasky explained the discrepancies by telling the jury: ``Law
enforcement waited to have a case that came together.''
   Gotti's lawyers disparaged the truthfulness of the criminals who
were called to testify, saying they were lying to save themselves.
   ``We are in America,'' Cutler said. ``That's not how it's
supposed to be. People are not supposed to be convicted because of
who they are, who their friends are, what their background is.''
   The principal witness linking Gotti to the O'Connor shooting was
James ``Studs'' McElroy, 45, a former Westies gang member who is
serving a 60-year federal sentence.
   McElroy testified that he was introduced to Gotti as the Westie
who was going to ``whack'' O'Connor.
   Cherkasky said of McElroy: ``The simple fact is, this man is not
smart enough, not subtle enough to lie.''
   But Cutler said McElroy testified to help his girlfriend get
favorable treatment in a drug case and increase his own chances of
getting out of jail.
   O'Connor recovered from at least four shots in the buttocks and
testified for the defense, invoking his right against
self-incrimination several times when cross-examined.
   He has been charged with extortion, perjury, larceny and labor
racketeering.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate For Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people filled
Prague's Old Town Square on Tuesday and demanded the estimated
75,000 Soviet troops be unconditionally withdrawn from
Czechoslovakia by May 31.
   The Soviet troops were denounced as occupiers who came to crush
the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968.
   The crowd, estimated at about 8,000 by a Western reporter and at
30,000 by the state news agency CTK, applauded a speaker who
demanded that Vasil Bilak and other former leading Communists
thought to have been responsible for inviting the troops to
Czechoslovakia be put on trial.
   The new coalition government, headed by President Vaclav Havel,
has demanded the withdrawal of the Soviet forces by the end of
1990, declaring void two 1968 agreements with Moscow that legalized
their deployment after they headed the Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Talks on the troop withdrawal resume in Moscow on Wednesday,
before Havel makes his first visit to the Kremlin at the end of
this month to present plans for European change to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The crowd chanted ``That's the end, Ivan!'' and ``Nobody wants
you!'' and showed overwhelming support for a declaration demanding
the withdrawal of the troops by May 31, supervised by a
Czechoslovak-Soviet commission.
   They also urged the restoration of all facilities used by the
Soviets to their original state. All damage caused by the troops
should be assessed and compensated, said the declaration, read to
the crowd by Social Democrat Slavomir Klaban.
   Banners waving in the crowd read, ``At home you will be people,
here you are just occupiers.'' Others in Russian urged the troops
to go home.
   The demonstration, which ended with a minute of silence for the
72 Czechoslovaks killed and 266 wounded in the 1968 invasion, was
organized by the Social Democratic party, one of about 40 parties
that have emerged since Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution in
November overturned one-party Communist rule.
   The demands of the crowd went further than those of the
coalition government, which is pushing for a 50 percent withdrawal
of Soviet forces by mid-May, with the remainder leaving by year's
end.
   The first round of talks on the withdrawal, the most sensitive
issue in Czechoslovak-Soviet relations, took place in Prague Jan.
15-16 but failed to produce tangible results.
   Unlike Hungary, where initial talks on a Soviet troop withdrawal
took place last week, Czechoslovakia considers the matter of Soviet
troop withdrawal separate from Vienna talks on arms reduction in
Europe.
   The Soviet forces in both countries are viewed as occupiers who
crushed movements for democracy, in Hungary in 1956 and in
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   The demands from Prague and Budapest for a Soviet troop pullout
have increased pressure on Moscow for a radical cutback in central
Europe, under discussion at the Vienna talks.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who met Havel on
Tuesday, travels to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with Gorbachev on
the U.S. proposal to cut U.S. and Soviet troops in all Europe to
225,000 on each side, with a limit of 195,000 in central Europe.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Challenge to Ban on Polystyrene Foam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today dismissed a legal challenge
by McDonald's restaurants and others to Portland's new ban on food
containers made of polystyrene foam.
   The law, which took effect Jan. 1, prohibits the use of the
packaging by restaurants and food vendors. It was not being
enforced pending resolution of the legal challenge.
   Circuit Judge Douglas R. Spencer heard arguments Monday on
whether to dismiss the lawsuit and granted the request this
morning. He ruled that the city was within its authority in
enacting the ban.
   The lawsuit, filed by three recycling companies and several
restaurants, including McDonald's franchises, claimed the ban
violates state solid-waste law and policies. McDonald's uses foam
in packaging Big Macs and other items.
   But City Attorney Jeffrey L. Rogers argued that state policies
on solid-waste management don't prohibit the city from banning
foam. The city contends foam food containers fill up landfills,
take generations to break down and are not recyclable.
   Mark L. Cushing, representing the plaintiffs, contended that the
ban conflicts with state priorities for waste management. He said a
trial would prove that polystyrene foam is recyclable, and his
clients are recycling it.
   McDonald's and other foam users have argued that the alternative
to foam is paper products, which would end up at a landfill, the
last alternative on the state priority list.

<TEXT>
   When Mayor David Dinkins gave House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt a lesson on how to ride the subway while
drinking a cup of coffee, it was more than the java jive _ it was
illegal.
   The mayor, the Missouri Democrat and other members of Congress
took a four-stop ride on a subway train Monday as part of an effort
to stop Bush administration plans to cut federal highway and mass
transit aid.
   Dinkins sipped his coffee while straphanging.
   ``You note, I have the ability to ride holding on (with) one
hand and drinking coffee without spilling it all over,'' Dinkins
said, a bit didactically. ``I learned to do this by riding the
subways.''
   Mr. Dinkins, meet section 1050.6 , paragraph F of the New York
City Transit Authority's rules and regulations: ``No person shall
bring or carry on a conveyance liquid in an open container.''
   The violation is punishable by a $25 fine. Nine people were
ticketed last year for drinking coffee or soda on a train, along
with 948 passengers who drank more potent spirits. Others were just
ordered to dump their drinks.
   Not surprisingly, Dinkins was not ticketed.
   Said Termaine Garden, a TA spokesman: ``It's a discretionary
call. It's up to the police officer.''

   The cameras are rolling on actor Kevin
Spacey as fallen PTL evangelist Jim Bakker and Bernadette Peters as
his wife, Tammy Faye.
   ``Fall From Grace,'' which ends with the couple's ouster from
the television ministry in 1987, is in its first full week of
production in Los Angeles, The Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday.
   The NBC movie, suggested by the Bakkers, should be broadcast
sometime in May. NBC bought rights from the couple, but won't say
how much was paid.
   NBC publicist Catherine Boxberger would say only that the
agreement stipulated the couple would not have script approval.
   Actress Annie Rubanoff will play former church secretary Jessica
Hahn, whose revelations of a sexual encounter with Bakker started
an investigation into his ministry.
   Bakker is serving 45 years in a federal prison in Minnesota
after being convicted last fall in federal court in Charlotte of
fraud and conspirary charges.

   Steve Garvey, the former baseball star whose
sexual exploits made him grist for the tabloid mill, is set to pick
up another broadcasting job not long after he was fired by a San
Diego radio station.
   ``Somebody said to me that I was like President Reagan, that no
matter what happens to me, it bounces off and I end up on my
feet,'' Garvey said Monday.
   Garvey is going to Prime Ticket, a local cable network focusing
on sports, to provide commentary on college baseball games and
produce a series on charity sporting events.
   Garvey was fired less than two weeks ago as a sports talk show
host at XTRA, where Garvey debuted last June with a four-hour
morning show. Within about two months Garvey's air time dwindled to
about 15 minutes each hour.
   Last year, it was revealed Garvey had relationships with three
women at the same time. Two of the women became pregnant by him; he
married the third.
   Don Corsini, Prime Ticket's program director, said the publicity
surrounding the former Los Angeles Dodger and San Diego Padre had
no bearing on his hiring.
   ``It's all in the past. It wasn't a factor,'' Corsini said.

   Actor Kevin Costner has filed a lawsuit
claiming a movie in which he played a minor role is being marketed
to profit from his hit film ``Field of Dreams.''
   Costner is shown on the video cover of ``Chasing Dreams''
wearing a baseball uniform but does not play a baseball player in
the 1985 film, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S.
District Court against Prism Entertainment Corp.
   In ``Field of Dreams,'' Costner plays a farmer who builds a
baseball diamond in his corn field where ghost players, including
``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson and other members of the 1919 Chicago
``Black Sox'' come to play. It has grossed $63 million since its
release last year.
   ```Chasing Dreams' was neither critically acclaimed nor
financially successful,'' wrote Costner's attorney Frank Rothman.
``It was shown only in approximately 40 movie theaters in the
Midwestern United States.''
   Universal Pictures Inc., which owns U.S. distribution rights to
``Field of Dreams,'' is Costner's co-plantiff in the lawsuit.
   Prism President Barry Collier declined comment, saying he had
not seen the lawsuit.

   Success can have its drawbacks, says
singer and Grammy award winner Bobby McFerrin.
   ``It can be a burden,'' the soft-spoken McFerrin said. ``People
want you to repeat what you've already done. You have to watch that
you keep growing, stretching.
   ``I found myself getting bored,'' the San Francisco-based singer
said. ``I'd begun to pander to the audience _ they wanted `Don't
Worry, Be Happy' and `The Wizard of Oz.' It was all getting too
easy.''
   McFerrin and his 11-person all-vocal ensemble ``Voicestra'' are
here preparing for a sold-out concert Saturday.
   ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' was McFerrin's 1989 Grammy hit.

<HEAD>Schools Closed As Demonstrations Continue Over Superintendent's
Dismissal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Student protests over the dismissal of
Selma's first black school superintendent forced the closing of two
schools today.
   The action came a day after four protesters were arrested at a
City Hall demonstration, and after officials canceled a board
meeting when hundreds of protesters took over the stage at an
auditorium the board planned to use.
   A spokeswoman in Mayor Joe Smitherman's office said students
were sent home this morning as demonstrators gathered at the
predominantly black, 1,500-student Selma High School, the city's
only public high school.
   Eastside Middle School's 400 students also were dismissed,
assistant superintendent James Carter said.
   Officials were considering whether to close Westside Junior
High, which has some 900 students, said the mayor's office.
   An unidentified worker who answered the telephone at the high
school said protesters had left school grounds by late morning.
There were conflicting accounts as to whether demonstrators had
entered the building.
   No arrests were immediately reported.
   Students later gathered at a Baptist church, where a protest
leader, Ronald Peoples, said parents had gone to the high school to
remove their children because of ``allegations it was unsafe and
not a learning environment.''
   The dispute began in December, when the six white members of the
Selma Board of Education voted not to renew Norward Roussell's
contract when it expires in June. That prompted the five black
members _ who voted to retain Roussell _ to walk out.
   Protesters have charged Roussell was dismissed because he is
black, an allegation denied by white school board members. They
cited an unfavorable job evaluation and an authoritarian management
style in his firing.
   Critics have organized school boycotts and other demonstrations.
One day last month, more than a third of the system's 6,000
students stayed home. The school system is 70 percent black.
   Last week, the remaining members of the board decided to remove
Roussell from the $80,000-a-year job this week, a move they said
was necessary to restore ``peace and tranquility.''

   Cherokees are the largest American Indian
tribe, Tlingits the richest and Navahos the poorest, the Census
Bureau reported Tuesday.
   Chickasaws registered the highest median age, 27.6 years, while
the best high-school graduation rate, 68.4 percent, was attained by
the Comanches, according to the bureau.
   The report on American Indians essentially completed the
agency's publications of 1980 census data _ just two months before
the 1990 census gets underway. Though data about Indians as a whole
was published previously, the tribal breakdown had to wait because
of budgetary constraints, the bureau said.
   The report said that members of the Blackfoot tribe have the
highest rate of labor force participation, while the top family
income was reported by the Tlingit tribe, many of whose members
live and work in Alaska, where salaries are routinely higher. The
greatest poverty rate was among the Navajo.
   Overall, the 1980 census counted 1,478,523 American Indians,
with Cherokees by far the largest tribe at 232,080.
   In second place were Navajos at 158,633, followed by Sioux,
78,608; Chippewa, 73,602 and, Choctaw, 50,220.
   Rounding out the top 10 were the Pueblo, 42,552; Iroquois,
38,218; Apache, 35,861; Lumbee, 28,631 and Creek, 28,278.

   West Germany's labor chief on
Tuesday urged East Germans to think twice before emigrating to the
West because of the already overcrowded job market.
   The continuing flood of East Germans resettling in West Germany
has raised enormous concerns in both countries, leading to warnings
of serious economic and social problems.
   Federal officials say that so far this year, 66,000 East Germans
have emigrated to West Germany _ an alarming average of nearly
1,800 per day arriving in one of Europe's most densely populated
countries.
   Heinrich Franke, the head of West Germany's federal labor
office, said 132,100 East Germans were registered as unemployed
last month.
   ``I appeal to all potential resettlers to consider their future
job and housing possibilities before leaving the German Democratic
Republic,'' Franke said in Nuremberg.
   ``Whoever plans to resettle should not simply give up their old
job and apartment and head off to the West by car,'' he added.
   As an added service to East Germans, Franke said, government
employment offices near the border and in West Berlin were
counseling potential immigrants on their chances.
   Job opportunities vary widely for the newcomers.
   East German craftsmen and bakers, for example, often take jobs
that many young West Germans snub.
   But newly arrived physicians are finding a market so overcrowded
that many have proposed sending doctors to East Germany as a
humanitarian gesture and as a way to keep the medical personnel
busy.
   Franke added that East German factory workers and engineers were
also having a difficult time finding work in West Germany.
   The overall West German unemployment rate climbed to 8.5 percent
in January from 8 percent in December, Franke announced. That meant
that nearly 2.2 million workers were jobless in West Germany.
   West Germany also has been coping with an influx of tens of
thousands of ethnic Germans from other parts of Eastern Europe,
including Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union.
   They accounted for 137,500 jobless workers in addition to those
from East Germany, Franke said.
   The influx straining the job market and the housing market has
led to growing calls for curbs, including appeals from Saarland
state Governor Oskar Lafontaine.
   Lafontaine, virtually certain to be the opposition Social
Democrats' chancellor candidate this year, has said the country
cannot maintain its open-door policy indefinitely.
   The Social Democrats' economics expert, Wolfgang Roth, predicts
the influx of East Germans could jump even further in the coming
weeks.
   ``We have the impression that about 3 million GDR citizens (East
Germans) are sitting on packed suitcases,'' Roth said in an
interview on Saarland state radio.
   Roth, a member of Parliament, added: ``When spring comes and it
gets warmer, they'll get into their cars, stick a tent in the back
and drive into the Federal Republic (West Germany) whether there
are emergency shelters here or not.''
   Reports from East Germany have said that tens of thousands more
people are ready to leave if conditions do not rapidly improve in
their troubled homeland.
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been seeking a halt to the
exodus, which comes on top of more than 340,000 East Germans who
arrived in West Germany last year.
   Kohl previously insisted that any fundamental changes would have
to wait until a democratically elected government takes over in
East Berlin, even though free elections won't take place nearly six
weeks.
   On Tuesday, however, Kohl called for immediate talks with East
Germany on a monetary union between the two states, to try to
rescue East Germany's crumbling economy and stop the growing exodus.
   Several state governments have proposed curbing the massive
financial assistance paid to the East German resettlers and the
ethnic German newcomers.

   A maintenance crew working in a commuter
railroad tunnel below midtown Manhattan apparently sliced through a
live cable today, causing an explosion and fire that injured 10
workers, authorities said.
   The 12:38 p.m. blast under the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel shut down
all service to and from Grand Central Terminal, the starting and
ending point for trains serving 95,000 commuters between New York
City and its northern suburbs.
   There was no word on whether service would resume for the
evening rush hour, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for the
Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
   The blast occurred after a machine used by Metro-North workers
to tamp down railroad ties apparently cut through a power cable, he
said.
   Ten Metro-North workers were taken from the scene suffering from
smoke inhalation, including one who suffered a smoke-induced asthma
attack, authorities said. Two firefighters were reported slightly
injured.
   Three of the railroad workers were taken to a hospital; the rest
of the injured were treated at the scene or at a firehouse,
authorities said.
   There were no trains in the tunnel at the time of the explosion,
Brucker said.
   Smoke wafted into the Waldorf lobby but caused no major
problems, hotel spokeswoman Marilyn Marks.
   The smoky fire was extinguished within about an hour, said Fire
Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla.

   Florida's revenue director resigned
Tuesday over allegations she abused her powers, denying wrongdoing
but saying her battle with breast cancer and the prospect of a long
fight left her little choice.
   Katie Tucker, 46, who served almost 20 months as chief of the
Department of Revenue, was under fire for ordering a 1988 tax
investigation that singled out a former political opponent of her
husband's.
   ``I emphatically and unequivocally deny that I have ever abused
the power of my office for any purpose,'' Ms. Tucker said. ``I just
feel like I was blocked at every turn.''
   The resignation does not necessarily end her troubles. The
Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating whether she
tampered with documents in an effort to clear her name, a
third-degree felony.
   Ms. Tucker and her attorney, Barry Richard, told Gov. Bob
Martinez and the Cabinet that the director could not defend herself
against a perception of abusing her office and that she did not
want to put her family through ``a protracted defense where right
or wrong has little to do with the outcome.''
   She also brought up her ongoing battle with breast cancer,
noting her doctors said the additional stress of the battle to save
her job could contribute to her health problems.
   ``It's not worth even a moment more of wasted energy on fights
that can only hurt me,'' she said. ``God knows the truth, has a
purpose to all of this, and God knows what you have lost.''
   Despite previous statements that indicated Ms. Tucker hoped to
persuade the governor and Cabinet to retain her, Richard said a
Monday night meeting convinced her there was no chance of that.
   Martinez, who previously called for her resignation, said Ms.
Tucker did not manage to convince him of her innocence and made
contradictory statements about what happened.
   ``If anything, I'm more convinced now than I was at the time we
suspended her that she no longer needs to stay at the state
Department of Revenue,'' the governor said. ``I think it was not
only the incident itself but how she went about trying to explain
the incident that gives you great cause for concern.''
   Deputy Comptroller Larry Fuchs was named interim director.
Fuchs, 47, said he would not seek the job on a permanent basis. A
search committee is to find candidates for a replacement.
   Ms. Tucker was suspended by Martinez and the Cabinet two weeks
ago to allow her time to respond to a Department of Law Enforcement
report on the tax investigation of businesses owned by Donald G.
Resha.
   The FDLE found that Ms. Tucker committed no crime but ordered
the tax probe against Resha, who lost a 1985 AFL-CIO election to
her husband, Daniel Miller.
   Ms. Tucker has maintained she ordered a larger probe aimed at
finding whether video stores such as those owned by Resha were
failing to pay taxes and whether they were involved in other
criminal wrongdoing. She denied the probe was a vendetta.
   After reports that Ms. Tucker had visited her office at night
and was seen typing documents, the FDLE last week confiscated some
files and her typewriter to find out whether any documents had been
tampered with. Ms. Tucker denied the allegations.
   As for her future, Ms. Tucker said she intended to take some
time off ``to ski and to fish'' before deciding what to do next.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Legalization of ANC a Sign of Hope</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Tuesday that South
African President F.W. de Klerk's lifting of a ban on the African
National Congress is a sign of hope for the nation's black majority.
   The lifting of bans on the ANC and some 60 opposition groups,
announced by de Klerk on Friday, will help pave the way toward ``a
new South Africa,'' Jackson said in Lusaka.
   Jackson is scheduled to travel to South Africa on Wednesday, his
first visit since 1979. His visa requests repeatedly were turned
down until his most recent application.
   In Cape Town, Foreign Minister Pik Botha indicated it was not
the most opportune time for Jackson to visit because of rapid
political changes in the country.
   ``Right now we are in the midst of important decisions, and it's
not easy to deal with all of the fanfare of some of our American
friends,'' Botha said at a briefing. But he said Jackson was
welcome.
   Jackson arrived in Zambia on Tuesday after visiting Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in Britain and was to hold talks with
President Kenneth Kaunda, who is also chairman of the six-nation
African Frontline bloc neighboring South Africa.
   The civil rights leader has said he hopes to meet de Klerk and
jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela on his current trip. He was
invited to South Africa by freed ANC leader Walter Sisulu and the
South African Council of Churches.
   Botha complained that Jackson, a former candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination, alternates his statements on
sanctions depending on his audience.
   He said Jackson has told South African officials he favors an
end to punitive sanctions against the country to pressure for an
end to apartheid, but then makes public speeches appealing for new
sanctions.
   ``The time has come when Jesse and I must talk straight to each
other,'' Botha said.
   He added that Jackson's visit will have nothing to do with
Mandela's release, because the decision already has been made.
   ``He can enjoy the aftermath, but not claim any credit,'' Botha
said.

<TEXT>
   An international bank sentenced to forfeit
$15 million for laundering drug money has begun turning records
over to prosecutors, including documents of financial dealings with
Manuel Noriega.
   The deposed Panamanian dictator was a longtime customer of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International branch in Panama. Court
records show he maintained accounts totaling at least $23 million
at various BCCI branches before he was indicted in drug cases in
Tampa and Miami in February 1988.
   The government is trying to trace his money.
   Although prosecutors didn't mention Noriega, they said the bank
had pledged full cooperation.
   Sentencing Monday resolved charges against the bank. Five bank
officers remain on trial, including Amjad Awan, longtime personal
banker to Noriega.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges listened to bank attorneys
and government prosecutors defend the plea agreement before
deciding to stick to terms of the agreement despite calls from
Congress for harsher penalties.
   The Luxembourg-based bank, with branches in 73 countries, could
have faced up to $28 million in fines. Subsidiaries BCCI, S.A. and
BCCI Overseas Ltd. admitted to conspiracy and 30 acts of money
laundering.
   The two divisions pleaded guilty Jan. 16 to cocaine-related
money-laundering charges, agreed to forfeit a record $14 million
plus $1 million in interest frozen earlier, and promised to open
their books.
   The plea agreement called for the bank to receive a suspended
fine and five years probation, with banking practices supervised by
the Federal Reserve System. Prosecutors also said they wouldn't
bring any other charges against the bank arising from the $32
million international money-laundering case.
   ``Those who have criticized the agreement are misinformed and
did not understand the facts of the case,'' said bank attorney
Lawrence Wechsler.
   ``This is no slap on the wrist,'' said Greg Kehoe, first
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Maori protesters
plunged into the water and jeered Tuesday as Queen Elizabeth II
came ashore to mark the 150th anniversary of the treaty that ceded
New Zealand to Britain.
   About 400 protesters were among the 5,000 people who gathered to
greet the queen at the site where the treaty of Waitanga was signed
by 500 Maori chiefs and Navy Capt. William Hobson, who represented
the queen's great-great grandmother, Victoria.
   The protesters, some shouting ``Go home, Queenie,'' plunged into
chest-deep water as the queen's spectacular flotilla neared the
shore. The queen arrived by navy launch, escorted by 22 giant war
canoes, some with up to 200 crewmen.
   After she got into an open car for a short drive to the
ceremonial treaty site, a woman threw a black T-shirt at her as she
drove by. Police spokesman Tony Bouchier said there were five
arrests for minor offenses, including an unidentified Maori woman
who threw the shirt.
   The queen looked startled as the T-shirt landed in her car.
Bouchier said onlookers held the woman and called police.
   The queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, wore a
feather cloak in the hot sun. Several Maori dancers in the
procession fainted in front her her car and were carried off.
   Fire department trucks sprayed torrents of cold water on the
sweltering crowds.
   In a traditional welcome, Maori warriors with tatooed faces
challenged the queen as she arrived at the treaty site, dancing
forward, jabbing the air with spears, rolling their eyes, and
sticking out their tongues in a symbolic test to determine if a
newcomer is friend or foe.
   In the open stands, Maori activists unfurled banners and kept up
a chant of of ``Honor the treaty! Honor the treaty!''
   They booed Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, but stayed silent for
the queen's address in which she said, ``I am a descendant of one
party of the treaty of Waitangi and many here today are the
descendants of the original Maori signatories.''
   In an unusually frank admission, she admitted the treaty had its
weaknesses and that it had not always been followed.
   Many Maori were disappointed, but ``it is encouraging to know
... progress has been made in putting things right,'' she said.
   ``Today we are strong enough and honest enough to learn the
lessons of the last 150 years and to admit that the treaty has been
imperfectly observed,'' she said.
   Later, she met with the descendants of the original chiefs, many
of whom are demanding land, forests and fishing grounds be returned
to Maori people under terms of the 1840 treaty.
   The treaty is regarded by European and Maori New Zealanders as
the foundation of modern New Zealand, a nation of 3.4 million
people of whom 12.5 percent are Maori.
   The queen flew to Waitangi on the Bay of Islands from Auckland
as part of a 16-day visit.

<TEXT>
   A mild earthquake off
California's coast triggered a routine alert at the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant Tuesday, but few people felt it and there were
no reports of damage or injuries.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park said the quake at 10:14
a.m. PST measured 4.1 on the Richter scale, but the California
Institute of Technology seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the
magnitude was 3.6.
   The agencies gave about the same location for the epicenter,
with the Geological Survey placing it 33 miles southwest of San
Luis Obispo and Caltech putting it 40 miles west of Santa Maria.
   ``We didn't feel it and we didn't get one call from anybody
outside Diablo Canyon,'' said San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Sgt.
Leon Cole.
   As is routine for earthquakes detected at the twin-reactor
nuclear plant, the quake triggered an ``unusual event,'' the
lowest-grade emergency declaration, but both reactors kept
operating at full power, said Brad Thomas, spokesman for Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co., which runs the plant.
   ``One person reported here at the plant they felt it,'' Thomas
said. ``That requires us to declare an unusual event. We do a plant
walkdown and make sure there was no damage of any kind.''
   Diablo Canyon's accelerometer, which measures the force exerted
by earthquakes, detected quake-caused motion equal to only one
five-hundredth the force of gravity, Thomas said.
   The Richter scale is an indirect gauge of the energy released by
an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, while 4 can cause moderate damage.

   Caviar isn't kosher, but the Technion institute
in Haifa says it has developed a substitute that is.
   The delicacy is off limits to observant Jews because it is made
from the eggs of sturgeon, which do not have scales. Kosher dietary
rules ban the eating of fish without scales.
   The new product, which took three years to develop, is made from
a kosher fish, Technion said in a statement.
   It also will sell at a bargain price, Technion said. Russian
caviar sells for about $48 an ounce on world markets, but the
kosher substitute will go for about $2, it said.
   The new product is reported to look and taste like the real
thing. Martin McDonald, a chef at the Dan Panorama Hotel in Tel

   An advertising campaign promoting an Italian
restaurant landed an advertising executive in the hot seat when a
television station misinterpreted notes about a coming ``hit.''
   It started when a black bag containing a water pistol and a note
scrawled on a burned piece of paper reading ``Be Prepared for the
Hit'' was delivered to television station KCNC last week. No other
explanation was included. Station employees called police.
   Then came a bottle of Chianti with a second note that said:
``Save this _ the hit is coming next Wednesday.''
   KCNC photographers videotaped a car leaving the station.
   Police traced the car's plate and staked out the Sales 1 On 1
advertising office operated by Scot Rogers and Terri Radcliffe.
   Rogers, who was driving the car, was apprehended Friday when he
arrived at work. Police took him to their station and gave him a
four-hour grilling.
   ``We lost days of work and our neighbors think we're
criminals,'' Radcliffe said. ``It was just a different way of
marketing _ and no one else took it seriously.''
   They had sent the same packets to most entertainment-food
writers in Denver.
   The final piece of the promotion will come Wednesday _ a lunch
from Berardi's restaurant with the message ``Mike Berardi's _ The
Hit of Denver,'' Radcliffe said.
   Radcliffe said she even plans to send one to the officer who
arrested Rogers _ to show there are no hard feelings.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Accused of Subsidizing Pornographic Stage Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican congressman is beginning a new
attack on the National Endowment for the Arts, promising weekly
examples showing the federal agency uses tax dollars to subsidize
pornography.
   In his first ``Dear Colleague'' letter to fellow House members,
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., accused the arts endowment of
underwriting a series of sexually explicit performances by porn
video star Annie Sprinkle at the Kitchen, a private performing arts
center in lower Manhattan.
   At one point in her act, he wrote, she commented that ``Usually
I get paid a lot of money for this, but tonight it's government
funded.''
   Endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer denied that was the case.
   Frohnmayer said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the
endowment gave a $60,000 grant to the Kitchen last year solely for
operating expenses, but did not award any grant for Miss Sprinkle's
12-performance show.
   ``I want to make it very clear that we do not fund anything that
is obscene and, in fact, my view is that art and obscenity are
mutually exclusive terms,'' he said. ``I think those who oppose
obscenity _ and I count myself among them _ might more fruitfully
look elsewhere.''
   He added, ``I don't intend to rise to the bait any time someone
comes up with a new horror story.''
   Barbara Tsumagari, executive director of the Kitchen, said in
New York that Miss Sprinkle's show was not financed with federal
funds.
   Ms. Tsumagari said the New York State Council on the Arts gave a
$25,000 grant to the Kitchen to underwrite part of its season of 54
performances, but specifically excluded Miss Sprinkle's show. That
was confirmed by council spokesman Tim Mulligan.
   Frohnmayer said the NEA gave the New York arts council a
$500,000 grant last year for staff salaries and other
administrative expenses.
   Under a headline that read, ``The National Endowment for the
Arts Is At It Again,'' Rohrabacher charged that ``Annie Sprinkle's
titillating masterpiece received your constituents' tax dollars.''
   He urged his colleagues to remind Frohnmayer that ``he is
dealing with taxpayer funds and is accountable for how they are
spent, just like every other head of every other federal agency.''
   Rohrabacher added: ``If the NEA can't hold itself responsible to
the U.S. taxpayer, it's our job to make them responsible.''
   The congressman's press secretary, David Eisner, said his boss
plans to publicize similar examples every week or so, highlighting
what he called the endowment's ``use of tax dollars for triple-X,
hard-core pornographic stuff.''
   Eisner said the NEA's supporters dismiss such cases as
``isolated incidents,'' but ``we are starting a campaign to really
work hard to show that's not the case. This is a systemic problem.''
   Frohnmayer, a former Portland, Ore., lawyer, took command of the
NEA last September amid a political controversy over a touring
exhibition, including sexually explicit pictures by photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe, that was partially financed by the endowment.
   That controversy prompted Congress, in approving a $171 million
budget for the NEA last October, to ban federal financial support
for obscene art _ deemed to be lacking in ``literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.''
   The House defeated a Rohrabacher proposal to abolish the
endowment, an independent federal agency that underwrites a wide
variety of artists and arts institutions with tax-paid matching
grants.
   Rohrabacher's new campaign could prove politically embarrassing
for the NEA at a time when the House and Senate are planning
hearings on legislation that would authorize extending the life of
the endowment.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the endowment's most vocal Senate
critic, peppered NEA officials last November and December with
demands for details of the endowment's history of support for eight
arts groups and nine artists.
   Helms' letters indicated he was concerned about the sexual
content of their work. Arts supporters say Helms is conducting a
campaign of intimidation against NEA grant recipients who
specialize in experimental and controversial arts projects.
   Frohnmayer, asked about the Helms letters, said, ``I deem all
congressional inquiries to be legitimate and I respond to them, and
that's what I intend to do in this case.''

<HEAD>National Press Club Won't Rename Mencken Library</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The library at the National Press Club will
continue to bear the name of journalist H.L. Mencken despite what
the club's secretary described as ``despicable'' remarks about Jews
and blacks in Mencken's recently published diaries.
   The club's board of governors voted 7-4 Monday to retain
Mencken's name after receiving appeals from notables including
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who urged the club not to
rename its library ``in an excess of self-righteousness.''
   Mick Rood, a reporter for the States News Service and the club's
secretary, argued for removing Mencken's name, saying his ``remarks
about Jews and blacks were ... despicable.''
   ``In all his years of running down, say, the Methodists, the
context was ideological _ a hard-edged social commentary,'' Rood
said. ``Whenever he excoriated the Philistines, he presented a body
of convincing evidence. The only evidence behind his anti-Semitic
remarks was venom.''
   ``This club needn't honor this man in this way,'' Rood said.
``We can admire, but we needn't revere.''
   Schlesinger, in a letter to the club, said, ``Mencken had his
faults, like all the rest of us, and he made his mistakes, some of
them awful, but he was a great newspaperman and basically a
liberating influence on American society . I hope the National
Press Club will not turn its back on him in an excess of
self-righteousness.''
   Economist John Kenneth Galbraith and journalist Lawrence E.
Spivak also wrote to the board urging that the Mencken name be
retained.
   ``His comments on Jews and blacks are no worse than those one
could have heard around Harvard or any other major university in
those days and without evident shock,'' Galbraith said. ``You are
not, I trust, expelling Ivy League graduates of that period to the
extent that they survive.''
   Spivak, who succeeded Mencken as editor of The American Mercury
magazine and later moderated ``Meet the Press'' on NBC radio and
television, wrote, ``Mencken was a great journalist, but like many
of us, was stupid about a lot of things. Actually, his attitude
toward Jews was like that of many self-satisfied Jews that he knew.
Because they were Jewish, they felt they could say whatever they
wanted about other Jews without being considered anti-Semitic.''
   Morton C. Paulson, associate editor of Changing Times magazine,
told his fellow board members:
   ``I am convinced that he was far from being a racist, a bigot or
sympathetic to the Third Reich.
   ``The last column he wrote for the Baltimore Evening Sun before
he suffered a disabling stroke was a withering attack on the city
for segregating a public park.''
   ``In any event,'' he added, ``nothing will change the fact that
his contributions to journalism were extraordinary and he was one
of the greatest literary scholars of all times.''
   The library was named the H.L. Mencken Library and Reference
Center when it opened in 1984. In naming it, the board noted that
Mencken once said he could be the the second best expert on any
subject if he had a first-class library behind him.
   Mencken, who died in 1956, was a long-time columnist for The
Evening Sun in Baltimore, as well as the author of a highly praised
work on the American language and a classic memoir.
   His recently published diaries contain such phrases as ``a brisk
clever Jew'' and ``a highly dubious Jew'' and he says of
``colored'' women that ``they are all essentially child-like, and
even hard experience does not teach them anything.''
   The motion defeated by the board would have removed Mencken's
name and left the renaming of the library to future action.
   Those voting against the motion, and thus to keep the Mencken
name, were Kathryn Kahler of Newhouse News Service, board
chairwoman; John Peterson, The Detroit News, vice president of the
club; Gil Klein, Media General, vice chairman of the board; Tom
Squitieri, USA Today, club treasurer; Ed Prina, retired Washington
bureau chief for Copley Newspapers, financial secretary; Greg
Spears, Knight-Ridder Newspapers; and Rick Thomas, Roll Call Report
Syndicate.
   Board members voting for the motion, and thus to remove the
name, were Frances Hardin, Cable News Network; Dennis Melamed,
free-lance journalist; Clayton Boyce of Knight Ridder; and Rood.

<HEAD>Upscale Restaurateurs Scale Back for Price Conscious Consumers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of nation's restaurateurs are scaling back
their prices to lure the cautious customers of the '90s, who have
become as concerned about their wallets as they are about their
waistlines.
   ``Instead of breast of duck, we're serving cheddar-stuffed
meatloaf,'' said Brad Grill, manager of the upscale Harvest
restaurant in nearby Cambridge.
   ``The days of the $27 free-range chicken are over,'' Richard
Krause, chef and restaurant owner in New York City. ``No one wants
to pay that. It's too much money, no matter how good it is.''
   At Krause's new restaurant, The Rose Cafe, entrees range from
$12.95 to $17.95. He charged $17 to $24 for entrees at his recently
closed Melrose.
   ``With the shrinking discretionary dollar, people are choosing
places more intelligently, where there's a better value,'' Krause
said in a phone interview Tuesday. The changes also reflect a
better-informed customer, he said.
   ``Who wants to eat baby purple whatever beans at $35 a pound in
the middle of winter, when there are great string beans locally?''
he said.
   Peter Romeo, special projects editor at Nation's Restaurant
News, a trade publication, said the restaurant industry is
definitely seeing a slowdown.
   ``It's certainly slower than the heyday of the early '80s,''
Romeo said.
   People have leaner budgets and baby boomers who are starting
their own families are eating out less, he said from New York City.
Coupled with new restaurants entering the scene every day, these
developments mean ``everyone has to settle for a smaller piece of
the pie.''
   ``People are battening down the hatches a little bit. They want
to go out two or three times a week, rather than blow the whole wad
on a fancy meal,'' Romeo said.
   Changes in tastes were also responsible for the downturn, he
said.
   ``The infatuation with cutting edge cuisine has kind of ended.
There's not so many flower blossoms on the plate, just familiar
foods,'' Romeo said.
   Statistics confirm a slowing of growth in the restaurant
business nationwide, according to Anne Papa of the National
Restaurant Association in Washington, D.C., which tracks the
industry.
   The number of orders placed in upscale restaurants nationwide
increased 5.4 percent from 1982 to 1983. By 1988, there was an
annual decrease of 1.4 percent, and then it went back up slightly
in 1989, by 0.5 percent, Papa said.
   Cambridge's Harvest, which brings in about $3 million a year, is
taking steps to relieve the financial pinch, including cooking with
locally grown spices and fruits rather than those flown in from
Hawaii and Australia.
   Prices for entrees have dropped from an average of $20 to
$16-$17, and they are offering more $18-$25 wines than $25-$35.
   ``We're trying to be more accessible to the person who wants to
eat here more frequently rather than once a month,'' said Grill.
   Renato Burkhardt, the general manager at Locke-Ober, a famous
Boston restaurant, said cutting prices is risky.
   ``Shaving prices can have a couple of reactions _ either people
say the establishment is panicking, or they say it shouldn't have
had those prices anyway,'' Burkhardt said.
   Locke-Ober, which grosses about $6 million a year, instead
broadened its menu to include cheaper alternatives, called ``winter
fare,'' Burkhardt said.
   The winter fare includes venison and duck from the restaurant's
farm, and prices for entrees range from $18 to $20, as compared to
the regular menu offerings of seafood and continental cuisine
priced at $22 to $24.
   ``Until the storm is weathered, you have to do that to stay
alive, or, let me put it this way, to get the least rained-on,''
Burkhardt said.

<TEXT>
   A man charged with killing five people in
four states last July waived a preliminary hearing Tuesday and was
bound over for trial for allegedly having a homemade knife in jail.
   Gregg Francis Braun was ordered to stand trial on a charge of
possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner. Magistrate Archie
Valdez continued Braun's bond at $100,000. No trial date was set.
   Braun, 28, also is being held on $1 million bond in the July 23
shooting death of Springer convenience store clerk Geraldine
Valdez, no relation to the magistrate.
   The weapon possession charge was filed after Braun allegedly
threatened jail administrator Chuck Talley with a homemade knife
when Talley entered the day room on Christmas Day to give Braun
coffee. Talley was not injured.
   Assistant District Attorney Leslie Skinner said Tuesday that the
weapon was never found.
   Braun's trial on a first-degree murder charge in the death of
Ms. Valdez is scheduled May 7.
   Braun also is charged with two counts of murder in the July 19
shooting deaths of two convenience store clerks in his hometown of
Garden City, Kan., and with first-degree murder in the July 21
shooting death of a woman in an Ardmore, Okla., flower shop. He
also is charged with murdering the owner of a photo processing shop
in Pampa, Texas, on July 20.
   Braun said at an August preliminary hearing that he killed Ms.
Valdez but has denied involvement in other slayings. Ms. Valdez,
48, was shot twice in the head.
   Finney County Attorney Rick Pierce in Garden City has said Braun
will be sent to Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, in that order, after
his murder trial in New Mexico.

   Death threats have forced the family of
one Hmong teen-ager who was slain by a police officer to flee St.
Paul and the family of another boy is changing apartments,
relatives say.
   ``We got lots of phone calls, and they were telling us they were
... so happy about the shooting,'' said one of the boy's relatives,
who was afraid to be identified. ``And he was telling us he was
going to kill our cousin and he was going to kill our family, and
after that he was going to kill the Hmong people.''
   Two men made telephone death threats against a cousin of one of
the dead boys, against the boy's family and against Hmong people,
the families said.
   ``I think it would be prudent to take action to protect the
family,'' Christopher Thao, an attorney representing the families,
said Monday.
   Thai Yang and Ba See Lor, both 13, were killed in suburban Inver
Grove Heights on Nov. 15 by a single shotgun blast to their backs
after they ran from a stolen car.
   Officer Kenneth Murphy said he fired after he saw one of the
boys raise what he thought was a gun. No weapon was found, but
police discovered a screwdriver on the ground near the bodies. A
Dakota County grand jury declined to indict Murphy.
   Mayor Jim Scheibel said he was notified last week of the
harassment against the boys' families and was asked to ensure the
cooperation of the St. Paul Public Housing Agency. Both families
lived in public housing.
   Jon Gutzman, housing agency executive director, said he became
aware of the trouble Thursday. He said his agency will process and
approve a housing transfer for the family that has not left the
city.
   The families, who fled Laos after the Vietnam War, said they
have received numerous phone calls from people saying they should
leave the country and quit trying to pursue prosecution or a civil
lawsuit against the officer.
   Members of the Hmong community and their supporters reacted with
outrage to the killings and the grand jury decision and sought a
renewed investigation.
   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III refused that
request in December. But Humphrey agreed to set up a task force to
look into the issues of racism, police-community relations, the use
of deadly force by police and sensitivity training by law
enforcement officers. Those who sought the renewed investigation
said the task force proposal addressed their concerns and that they
would stop pushing for another probe.

<HEAD>Yeutter Sends Farm Bill Proposals to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter sent
Congress new farm proposals on Tuesday that he said maintain the
federal-benefit principles of the expiring 1985 law but give
farmers more flexibility.
   He did not, however, offer any advice for financing the
proposals, saying, ``We'll have to legislate in cooperation with
Congress.''
   ``We don't intend to make specific recommendations on how to
meet budget requirements,'' he said.
   The budget proposals President Bush released last week call for
a cut in fiscal 1991 commodity spending of $1.5 billion.
   When asked specifically about those cuts, Yeutter said, ``This
document doesn't deal with budget, it deals with policy.''
   He said the proposals generally are modifications to the 1985
Farm Act designed to ``provide the flexibility to adjust to changes
in the international marketplace; maintain the successful course
set in the 1985 legislation, ... and balance the need for an
abundant, safe and affordable food supply with conservation and
improvement of our environment.''
   To give farmers the planting flexibility Yeutter said they
consider the most important part of any new legislation, he has
proposed a ``normal crop acreage concept.''
   This would allow farmers to plant crops based on market demand
without loss of farm program benefits.
   It would define crops that could be substituted for program
crops, authorize crop-specific acreage reduction programs and
provide authority to plant on idled acres in exchange for giving up
specified deficiency payments.
   The administration proposals follow the introduction Monday by
the House Agriculture Committee of its 1990 farm bill.
   After a glance at Yeutter's recommendations, the House
Agriculture Committee chairman, Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
said he thought Congress would come up with legislation acceptable
to the White House without much trouble.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy,
responded negatively to Yeutter's proposal.
   ``Unfortunately, the heart of the farm bill is not there,'' said
Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. ``The administration fails to tell
farmers what it thinks target prices should be.
   ``American farmers don't know what their income will be and
Congress does not know how much the administration will be willing
to spend on farm programs.''
   A spokeswoman for the National Farmers Union, Cheryl Cook, said
her biggest criticism of the proposal was ``the lack of any
information whatsover on price'' levels relating to commodity
supports and targets.
   ``For our money, the whole purpose of the price-support program
is income protection for farmers, and that seems to be the one area
... that the administration has chosen not to look at at all.''
   Questioned about farm income at a news conference, Yeutter said,
``I see no reason why we should not be able to provide net farm
income that would give a very satisfactory standard of living to
farmers even though the federal contribution will decline.''
   He also said that the effect of his proposals on consumer prices
would be ``nominal.''
   The administration's recommendation that crop insurance be
replaced with a new crop disaster resistance program has already
been floated in Congress and is likely to produce lively debate
during discussion of the farm bill.
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides subsidized
all-risk coverage to farmers, has been losing money for many years,
with many farmers spurning the insurance and relying on Congress to
bail them out when an emergency arises.
   ``We have not found a way to make crop insurance work within
realistic budget targets,'' said the secretary.
   He said his proposal would provide payments for individual
losses whenever county-wide harvested yields fall below 65 percent
of normal on a crop-by-crop basis.
   He envisions a standing law designed along the lines of the ad
hoc disaster legislation passed in 1988 and 1989 to provide farmers
drought relief. His proposal would eliminate the need for such ad
hoc bills, he said.
   Other highlights in Yeutter's recommendations include:
   _A grain reserve and stocks policy based on annual contracts
that give the farmer more say in deciding when stocks should be
released into the marketplace.
   _Changing the trigger for acreage-reduction programs to be more
consistent with market and farmer needs.
   _Extending the loan rate formula for wheat and feedgrains to
upland cotton, extra longstaple cotton and rice. The 1985 loan rate
formula for soybeans also would be extended.
   _Incentives to use perennial cover crops on set-aside acreage as
a means to naturally improve soil fertility.
   _Methods for cutting down fraud in the use of food stamps and
grants to organizations that test innovative ways to get food
stamps to the homeless.
   _Tightening of the Farmers Home Administration programs so
borrowers can't so easily abuse its loan policy.
   _Requiring all exported corn to be tested for aflatoxin.

<HEAD>First Private TV Station in Poland Launches Broadcasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Poland's first privately owned television
station began regular broadcasts Tuesday, offering viewers in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw an alternative to state-run TV, the
state news agency reported.
   Called ``The Echo,'' the channel relays excerpts of programs
from the European Astra satellite, mixed with locally produced news
geared to Wroclaw and the Lower Silesia region, the PAP agency said.
   Broadcasts are to be limited to four hours a day for the next
few months, PAP said. The station is located on the 10th floor of a
student hostel in Wroclaw.
   A law passed last year by the new Solidarity-led government
permitted private companies to set up broadcast stations for the
first time in Poland's postwar history.
   Wroclaw residents previously could receive only Polish
Television's Channels One and Two and the two Czechoslovak channels
from Prague.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An important part of the Bush administration's
farm bill proposals announced Tuesday involves a ``flexibility''
plan to ease some of the government's restraints on crop plantings.
   One of the complaints of farmers is that Agriculture Department
rules to control production are too severe and often penalize them
for not following program regulations straight down the line.
   Wheat farmers must abide by rules in the wheat program; feed
grain producers must following feed grain regulations, and so on.
If there is deviation, the acreage base or history of a crop may be
reduced, thereby meaning reduced USDA payments and other benefits.
   Current law passed in 1985 expires at the end of the 1990 crop
season. It generally denies program benefits if farmers harvest
crops other than the ``program'' crop for which they have a base
acreage.
   A change in the strict rules is being sought by the
administration as well as by many farm groups and members of
Congress.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation favors acreage flexibility,
with a couple of stipulations of its own. And the National Farmers
Union, which is often at odds with the administration on farm
policy, also likes the idea but wants to study the fine print on
the administration's plan.
   Meanwhile, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter explained the
administration's version of flexibility at a news conference. And
it's not exactly a new idea, he said. Here's how it might work:
   Each farm is assigned a normal crop acreage, or NCA, which is
the total acreage bases of program crops such as wheat, feed
grains, upland and extra-long staple cotton. Plus a farm's
historical plantings of oilseeds: soybeans, sunflowers and
rapeseed, including canola.
   As it does now, the USDA each year determines whether to apply
individual crop ``acreage-reduction programs'' called ARPs, if
necessary, to each crop's base acreage. If so, a percentage of the
farm's base _ with the exception of oilseed acres _ must be idled
as an ``acreage conservation reserve,'' or ACR.
   To qualify for price supports and other program benefits, the
farmer must comply with the ARP requirement for that crop. In
addition, the sum of all NCA-crop plantings, plus land idled under
the acreage reduction programs, cannot exceed the NCA for the
individual farm.
   In return, the farmer is allowed some flexibility without losing
benefits or suffering penalties on the farm's acreage base.
   ``We're proposing that we would establish ARPs, acreage
reduction programs, on a crop-by-crop basis, just as we do now,''
Yeutter said. ``In other words, there'll be a wheat ARP and a corn,
or a feed grains ARP, and a rice ARP, whatever it may be.''
   Basically, on the rest of the acreage, the farmer will be able
to grow any of the so-called program crops, plus any of the oilseed
crops, he said.
   ``It's really what I would call a modified NCA program ... as
the NCA existed back in the '70s or thereabouts,'' Yeutter said.
   In an example, a 300-acre farm included a 100-acre wheat base, a
100-acre corn base, and 100 acres of soybeans. The mythical wheat
program included a 5 percent ARP and the corn program, a 10 percent
ARP.
   ``That means the farmer has to pull out 5 acres of land for his
wheat ARP, 10 acres for his corn ARP, and then under present law,
that means he'll plant 95 acres of wheat and he'll plant 90 acres
of corn,'' Yeutter said. ``And then on the other 100 acres he'll
grow soybeans or whatever.''
   Shifting to ``the simplest example'' of flexibility as proposed
in the administration plan, Yeutter said the ARPs would be the same
as they are now _ five acres of wheat and 10 acres of corn.
   But on the remaining 285 acres, Yeutter said, the farmer would
be allowed to grow wheat, corn, any of the oilseeds, rice, cotton
or whatever.
   ``And he can plant that in any proportions he wishes,'' Yeutter
said. ``If he wants to plant it all to wheat, he can plant it all
to wheat. If he wants to plant it all to corn, he can plant it all
to corn.''
   Yeutter described several variations of the plan in which the
300-acre farmer could plant certain crops on his set-aside acres,
provided his acres eligible for payments are reduced accordingly.
   Oilseeds and experimental crops such as kenaf used for newsprint
are among the options under the flexibility plan, he said.

<HEAD>California Couple Gets Warm Surprise in `Cold' North Dakota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired couple from California borrowed
jackets and parkas and set out to experience first-hand a real
blowing, snowing, below-zero North Dakota winter.
   They got a warm surprise.
   When Al and Felicia Phillips, of Escalon, Calif., east of San
Francisco, arrived about three weeks ago, they discovered
unseasonably warm temperatures with highs around 40 degrees.
   Tuesday's temperature in Bismarck had climbed to 40 by 1 p.m. In
the eastern part of the state, Devils Lake reached a record 44,
within 10 degrees of that day's temperatures in parts of northern
California.
   The Phillips, who travel on a modest retirement budget and
didn't want to rent a car all the time they were here, also found
Bismarck has no city bus system. ``As a result, we've done a lot of
walking,'' said Phillips.
   They're making the best of things while hoping for a blizzard.
The Phillips, who have been married 48 years, have kicked up their
heels at a square dance, sampled German food and joined the
cheering at a high school hockey game since they arrived Jan. 18.
   ``The nice people have more than made up for the lack of cold
weather,'' Phillips said.
   They said they had been hankering for cold weather and decided
to spend a winter month in some city that fit the bill.
   ``We thought North Dakota had to be a sure thing,'' Mrs.
Phillips said. They considered other North Dakota cities but
decided Bismarck sounded colder.
   ``We just came for the weather. That was the main thing,'' Mrs.
Phillips said. But her husband added:, ``Now that we're here, the
people are the main thing.''
   They plan to return home on Feb. 20, after renting a car long
enough to check out other North Dakota cities. And they promise to
come back to see what the state is like in the summer.
   They aren't bothered by the fact that their California friends
think they're crazy, Phillips said.
   ``If I had had a nickel for every time I heard that word, we
could have paid for our plane fare,'' he said.

<HEAD>Founding Priest of Covenant House Ordered to Take Leave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founding priest of Covenant House was
directed by his order to take leave of his duties Tuesday while it
investigates the allegations of sexual misconduct against him.
   Earlier in the day, the Rev. Bruce Ritter issued a statement
saying he had elected to take several weeks off from running the
shelter program for runaways so he could rest and recuperate from
stress.
   But Ritter's order of Roman Catholic priests, the Franciscans,
said it had instructed him to relinquish his duties until its
investigation was done. A spokesman, the Rev. Juniper Connelly,
said he had no idea how long that may be.
   The New York Times on Tuesday reported the Franciscan
authorities' investigation of charges by a former Covenant House
client that the 62-year-old Ritter had a sexual relationship with
him in 1973, when he was 14.
   Ritter, a prominent campaigner against the sexual exploitation
of youth, characterized such charges, now made by three men, as
``garbage,'' telling the Times he ``never, never'' had sexual
relations with any youth in Covenant House.
   In his statement, he said: ``I am profoundly saddened by the
allegations against me and the need to deny them constantly. I have
no way of proving my innocence. My accusers cannot establish my
guilt.
   ``I devoutly hope the inquiries currently under way will bring
an end to this incredibly painful chapter in my life.''
   Besides the Franciscan investigation, the Manhattan district
attorney's office is investigating Covenant House's use of funds
and its provision of false identification to at least one youth.
   Moreover, Covenant House said Monday that it had provided a
former male prostitute with the identity of a 10-year-old boy who
died of leukemia in 1980. It acted without the knowledge of the
boy's parents, saying it sought to protect the ex-prostitute from
enemies.
   The former prostitute, Kevin Kite, 26, is one of those making
charges against Ritter. In December, the New York Post reported
Kite's allegations that he had an eight-month sexual relationship
with Ritter beginning a year ago. He said Ritter gave him money,
housing and gifts in exchange for sex.
   Ritter has denied Kite's charges, and Kite's father stepped
forward to describe his son as a chronic liar.
   The accusation struck at a time of great success for Covenant
House, which has grown to become the nation's largest shelter
program for runaway youths since he founded it in 1968.
   It runs 17 shelters with more than 2,000 beds in the United
States, Canada and Latin America, and planned a broad expansion
this year.
   But donations, after tripling in four years, have declined since
Kite's charges were made public _ Covenant House took in $3 million
less than its expected $15 million in December _ and expansion
plans are on hold.
   At a Dec. 14 news conference, Ritter warned that ``copycats''
might make charges similar to Kite's. But the newly public
accusations from two more former Covenant House clients appear to
predate the December disclosure.
   On Jan. 24, the Village Voice reported that John Melican, now of
Seattle, charged in an unpublished interview in 1986 that he had a
13-year sexual relationship with Ritter. Melican repeated the
charges to the Times, saying the relationship began when he was 13.
   The Times reported that the third man, Darryl Bassile, 31, now
of Ithaca, charged that he had sexual relations with Ritter in 1973.
   After learning of Kite's charges, Bassile said, he made his own
complaint to the Franciscan Friary in Union City, N.J., and
contacted the Times when he had not heard back from the friary.
   The Franciscan minister provincial, the Rev. Conall McHugh, sits
on the board of Covenant House.
   McHugh said the order tried unsuccessfully to reach Bassile
before succeeding on Jan. 24. Now, he said, Franciscan leaders
``have directed Father Bruce to begin a period of rest and
recuperation without responsibility for Covenant House until this
inquiry is completed.''

   President Bush, proclaiming the United States
in ``excellent economic health,'' sent his first economic report to
Congress on Tuesday. He promised to restrain government spending
and push for tax cuts to foster even more prosperity.
   Bush said he would continue his fight to get Congress to reduce
the capital gains tax and pledged anew to fight protectionist trade
barriers.
   His message did not dwell on what many see as the biggest
failures of the Reagan years, the record federal budget deficits
and the huge trade imbalances that transformed America from the
largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country.
   Bush did pledge to deal with ``inherited problems,'' but his
formula for dealing with the budget deficit tracked Reagan's
approach, promising to oppose new taxes while relying on economic
growth and restraints in government spending to erase the deficit
by 1993.
   Many private economists say the administration's economic
outlook for the next five years is too optimistic.
   The administration foresees no recession with the gross national
product expanding at annual rates of 3 percent or higher from 1991
through 1995. ``Economic expansions ... do not die of old age. A
recession is not likely in the near term,'' the economic report
states.
   While stressing traditional Republican free-market themes, the
419-page, annual ``Economic Report of the President'' avoided some
of the more doctrinaire positions on monetary policy and
supply-side economics sounded during the Reagan years.
   Instead, Bush used the message, the first presented by his
administration, to lay out generally mainstream economic goals such
as the need for growth-oriented policies and renewed efforts to
bring the federal deficit under control.
   On taxes, Bush said, ``One of my highest legislative priorities
this year is to reduce the captial gains tax rate. This tax reform
would promote risk-taking and entrepreneurship by lowering the cost
of capital. ... A capital gains tax cut would stimulate saving and
investment throughout the economy.''
   He also said that ``the primary economic goal of my
administration is to achieve the highest possible rate of
sustainable economic growth,'' Bush said in the report. ``Growth is
the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of
prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need and to
maintaining America's leadership in the world.''
   Addressing the differences between Bush and Reagan on economic
issues, Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, suggested that the administration was more
willing to use government to address problems in such fields as
boosting spending for research, fighting illegal drugs and
expanding Head Start.
   ``I think that President Reagan believed that not only was
government the problem, but that it was rare indeed that government
could be a positive force in solving the problem,'' Boskin said at
a briefing for reporters. ``(Bush) does believe in some areas the
federal government has an important role to play.''
   In the economic report, Bush reviewed the period since the end
of the 1981-82 recession, a peacetime record of seven years of
expansion. In that time, more than 20 million jobs have been
created, driving the unemployment rate down to a level not seen
since the early 1970s.
   ``Our excellent economic health will allow us to build on the
successes of the 1980s as we prepare for the next century,'' Bush
said.
   Bush declared his top trade priority was successful completion
of the current 96-nation round of trade talks. The president is
seeking to eliminate farm subsidies and expand trading
opportunities in banking, insurance and other service industries in
which American firms excel.
   ``We cannot remain competitive by avoiding competition. My
administration will therefore continue to resist calls for
protection and managed trade,'' he said.
   Bush also rejected proposals for the federal government to
promote an ``industrial policy'' of picking winners and losers
among emerging technologies, declaring that ``second-guessing the
market is the way to raise government spending and taxes, not
living standards.''
   While sometimes critical of the Federal Reserve Board's interest
rate policies in his first year in office, the president praised
the central bank for a ``high degree of policy credibility.''
   In a departure from the monetarist leanings of the Reagan
administration, Bush's economic outlook warned against a reliance
on ``rigid monetary targeting,'' the process promoted by certain
economists in which the central bank focuses solely on controlling
the growth of the nation's money supply as the way to keep
inflation at bay.
   On other topics, the economic report:
   _Devoted an entire chapter to environmental regulation,
including the president's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act,
which environmental critics contend do not go far enough to
safeguard the environment. ``A healthy environment and a sound
economy can be compatible if _ and only if _ environmental
regulation is well-designed,'' the report states.
   _Deplored Americans' low savings rates, offering as remedies a
cut in the tax on capital gains, profits earned on the sale of
assets, and proposals to expand the use of Individual Retirement
Accounts to first-time home buyers and to create a new Family
Savings Account that would allow married couples to invest up to
$5,000 tax-free as long as the money was held for seven years.
   The administration's tax-cut proposals came under heavy fire at
a congressional hearing.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. and chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said that such tax breaks have done little to
boost saving.
   ``Tinkering with the tax code is the worst thing we could do,,''
he said. ``This is just gimmickry that we are going to suffer for
in the long run.''
   Other Democrats on the committee assailed Bush's proposed cut in
taxes on capital gains as a giveaway to the rich, but Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady responded by saying it ``may be viewed as
unfortunate'' that most of the benefit of cutting taxes on capital
gains would go to those with incomes over $200,000 a year. It is
those people who have the most to invest, Brady noted.

<HEAD>Rightist Movement Figure Dead at 91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bin Akao, an activist in Japan's rightist movement,
died of heart failure Tuesday at the age of 91.
   For 35 years, Akao was a fixture in central Tokyo's Ginza
district, where he preached to passing shoppers and office workers
through a loudspeaker from a truck painted with such slogans as
``Japanese unite under the emperor.''
   Akao, a native of Nagoya in western Japan, started as a
socialist activist when he organized a farmers' union after
graduating from junior high school, but he became a rightist after
he was jailed in 1925 for his union activism.
   Akao was elected to the House of Representatives, the lower
house of Parliament, from a Tokyo district in 1942, but said he was
expelled in 1943 because he opposed Japan's attack on the United
States. He said he called instead for Japan to join with the
Western powers in a move to crush the Soviet Union.
   After the war, the Allied occupation forces banned him from
holding public office. When the ban ended in 1951, he established
the anti-Communist Great Japan Patriots' Party, of which he was
president. The rightist political organization has a membership of
150 in Japan, according to National Police Agency figures.
   Akao also was a leader in the nationwide rightist movement,
comprising 840 groups with 120,000 members.
   After the war, he ran unsuccessfully more than 20 times for
Parliament and other offices.
   Akao was believed associated with a series of right-wing
terrorist acts in postwar Japan, including the 1960 assassination
of then Japan Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma by one of
Akao's followers. Akao had a record of 25 arrests for violent
political activities.
   On his sound truck, flanked by several flags of Japan, the
United States and anti-Communist Taiwan, Akao would call in his
gravelly voice for a strengthening of the U.S.-Japan military
alliance and Japan's emperor system, and the toppling of the
Communist government of the Soviet Union.
   In some of his speeches, he referred to leaders of Japan's
conservative governing party, the Liberal Democrats, as ``idiots''
and ``money-grubbers'' after a series of money scandals.
   His party headquarters was decorated with portraits of emperors,
Buddha, Jesus Christ, the Chinese philospher Confucius and Otoya
Yamaguchi, the 17-year-old who stabbed Asanuma.
   He spoke of hoping to unite Confucianism, Buddhism, Communism
and Christianity into a culture of unity and peace. Japan's emperor
would be a suitable leader, he said.

<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday closed all
schools in the capital for an indefinite period as a preventative
measure to help stop the spread of cholera, the health ministry
said.
   Twelve people have died and 57 remain hospitalized since the
cholera outbreak began affecting central and suburban Lusaka, an
area encompassing 1 million people.
   The government announced Monday night that it had allocated $1.3
million toward fighting the intestinal disease, which is spread
mainly by poor sanitation and hygiene.
   Zambia is one of Africa's most indebted nations. Its capital,
long plagued by bureaucratic mismanagement, is surrounded by
mud-built shanties without plumbing.
   In heavy seasonal rains open-air pit toilets have overflowed,
adding to the city's health hazards, city officials said.
   Health minister Mavus Muyundu said the money would pay for
drugs, transport, fuel and the manning of eight 24-hour clinics in
affected areas of the city.
   She also appealed to city dwellers to bury piles of garbage that
accumulated in the streets because only six city garbage trucks
were in running order.

<HEAD>November Outflow the Lowest in 4 Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Savings and loan depositors withdrew $4.9
billion in November as the thrift industry continued to shrink in
response to tougher financial standards enacted last summer, the
government said Tuesday.
   It was the lowest level of withdrawals in four months, but was
still the 17th outflow in 18 months and brought total deposits at
the nation's 2,889 S&amp;Ls down to $947 billion, the Office of Thrift
Supervision said.
   Withdrawals in the first 11 months of 1989 totaled $64.9
billion. Outflows, which hit a record of $10.8 billion in January
1989, were $6.4 billion in October.
   The withdrawals early in the year were attributed to eroding
depositor confidence and rising interest rates offered by
investment alternatives such as money market mutual funds.
   Economists say outflows in the last half of the year are part of
a deliberate strategy by S&amp;Ls to comply with bailout legislation
enacted Aug. 9.
   ``Most of the shrinkage was likely due to thrifts' continuing
strategy to reduce assets to comply with new capital
requirements,'' said economist James Freund of the thrift office.
   The new standard, effective Dec. 7, requires S&amp;L owners to put
more of their own money behind their institutions.
   Weak thrift associations that have trouble raising capital are
finding they must reduce their portfolios of loans and other
investments. As they sell assets, they need fewer deposits.
   The industry's assets declined by $8.8 billion in November after
a $6.3 billion drop in October. They totaled $1.28 trillion,
compared with $1.33 trillion a year earlier.
   The 275 failed thrifts under government control at the end of
November, like the rest of the industry, experienced shrinkage.
Government-controlled thrifts lost $2.2 billion in deposits and
$2.3 billion in assets. Privately controlled thrifts shed $2.7
billion in deposits and $6.5 billion in assets.
   Weakness in housing and construction was reflected in a decline
in mortgages originated by thrifts to $14.5 billion, compared with
$15.8 billion a month earlier and $18.3 billion a year ago.

   A woodburning stove installed just a day
earlier was believed to have caused a fire Tuesday that killed six
people, four of them children, officials said.
   ``Apparently the flue pipe was a couple of inches too short
where it ran through the ceiling,'' said Washington County Sheriff
Ronnie L. Skiles. ``The stove had also been mounted on wooden
blocks. We're not sure yet whether it fell off or just what
happened.''
   Washington County Coroner Mal Gum said all of the victims died
of smoke inhalation and were badly burned. He said their bodies
were found in or near their beds.
   Killed were Michelle Miller, 22; James Miller, 3; Alicia Miller,
1; Davie Light, 18; 3-week-old Jessica Light, and Rachel Hafley, 3.
   Skiles said the fire, in the Jarvis trailer court about a mile
north of Potosi, was first reported at 5:26 a.m. and a deputy was
at the scene minutes later.
   Skiles said all of the children except Rachel Hafley, a neighbor
he believed, belonged to Michelle Miller or Davie Light.
   Skiles said officials believed the fire was caused by a
woodburning stove that was removed and reinstalled in a new place
in the trailer Monday. Skiles said there were no smoke detectors in
the trailer.

<HEAD>US Official Says Other Nations Lag in Controlling Drug Chemicals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Governments in West Germany, the Netherlands
and Japan are unwilling to control the export of chemicals used to
manufacture drugs, a Bush administration drug official said Tuesday.
   ``It does not seem likely that European chemical legislation, as
contemplated, will have a significant impact on the diversion and
trafficking of chemicals, particularly those destined for the
illicit production of cocaine,'' said Gene R. Haislip, deputy
assistant administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Haislip, testifying before the Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce
of the Senate Commerce Committee, said great quantities of
chemicals are shipped through the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
   ``Whereas in the past most of these shipments have come from the
United States, I think the shift is on and in the future we're
going to see that Europe, and to some lesser extent Brazil and
other countries, will become the predominant suppliers, with the
Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany... being the two
principal exporting countries,'' he said.
   He cited a case to show that several countries can be involved.
   ``A broker in London ordered the materials from a supplier in
the Netherlands and the materials were shipped from Rotterdam to
Colombia,'' he said.
   ``The customer was a fiction. The material _ acetone _ was
falsified on the manifest and shipping papers and the labels on the
containers themselves were spray-painted over so that the
merchandise could not be identified. ... The Europeans would like
to pretend that voluntary efforts will solve their problems and
it's quite clear that that is the thinnest kind of pretense.''
   In an interview after his testimony, Haislip said the West
German and Dutch governments are reluctant to interfere with what
they see as legitimate business.
   He said there is also a problem in trying to halt shipments of
chemicals for the manufacture of heroin in Burma and Thailand,
especially acetic anhydride from India and Japan. He reported that
he had some discussions with Indian authorities but that it was
harder to interest the Japanese.
   ``They're not accustomed to interfering with commerce,'' he said.
   At the hearing, Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both Nevada
Democrats, accused U.S. chemical companies of selling chemicals
that help make drugs in Colombia.
   ``The evidence is inescapable that some American chemical
manufacturers and distributors have contributed to America's $100
billion cocaine habit,'' said Bryan. ``The record shows that 52 out
of 288 requests for `regular customer status,' almost one in five,
were rejected by the Drug Enforcement Administration.''
   Reid focused on a chemical called methyl ethyl ketone or MEK,
which can be used to refine cocaine.
   ``Why is Exxon permitted to sell MEK to companies associated
with the drug cartel in Colombia?'' he asked.
   John Rutledge, Latin American manager for Exxon Chemical
Company, testified that he was confident that its shipments of MEK
were not being diverted from their legitimate use to remove wax
from lubricating oil.
   ``All of our sales of chemicals covered by the (law) are cleared
with the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to each individual
shipment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   NATO allies have given unanimous
support to President Bush's proposal for further deep cuts in
American and Soviet troops in Europe, an alliance official said
Tuesday.
   He said the offer probably would go to the bargaining table
Thursday at East-West negotiations in Vienna on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   The official, speaking privately, said the allies might offer
additional proposals, possibly concerning combat aircraft and
helicopters, at the Vienna talks. He did not give details.
   Negotiators for the 16 NATO members and the seven nations of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact are trying to complete an agreement this
year for dramatic reductions in personnel, tanks, artillery,
armored troop carriers, combat aircraft and helicopters from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains.
   They still must agree on definitions of equipment to be covered
by an accord and a verification system for ensuring compliance.
   In his State of the Union message last week, Bush proposed a
ceiling of 195,000 each from the United States and the Soviet Union
in Central Europe. The United States would have 30,000 more in
Britain and southern Europe.
   Last May, Bush recommended a limit of 275,000 for each side.
   An estimated 565,000 soldiers Soviet soldiers are in Europe
outside their national territory, about 400,000 of those in the
central region. The United States has 305,000 in Western Europe,
including 250,000 in the central zone.
   According to the NATO source, the alliance's High Level Task
Force of officials from member nations, which works on Western
positions for the arms talks, approved the Bush proposal
unanimously on Monday.
   The Vienna negotiations began in March 1989, supplanting talks
that had spanned 15 years without result.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer men, but more women, will die this year
from lung cancer _ and cigarette advertising is partly to blame,
the American Cancer Society said Tuesday.
   In its annual Cancer Facts and Figures, the society predicts
92,000 men will die this year of lung cancer, down from 93,000 last
year and the first decline since the projections began in 1953.
   That's because men have been quitting smoking over the last two
decades _ first, younger men, and now, all age groups, said Cancer
Society spokeswoman Joann Schellenbach. That is translating into
fewer cases of lung cancer.
   About 50,000 women will die of lung cancer, up from 49,000 last
year, the organization said.
   Schellenbach said women also are starting to give up smoking.
But their health trend hasn't caught up to men's yet _ because men
started smoking at the turn of the century and women started
smoking in the 1930s.
   In addition, she said, while many older women are trying to
quit, many younger ones don't _ because they're afraid of gaining
weight.
   ``There's a tremendous campaign, not only directed at women but
playing on the concern about weight,'' said Schellenbach, noting a
variety of cigarettes with ``slim'' in their brand name and new
cigarettes touted as having a pleasant, socially acceptable aroma.
   The Cancer Society is planning its own campaign to counter the
advertising.
   Lung cancer will account for 142,0000 of the 510,000 predicted
cancer deaths this year. In addition to smoking, risk factors
include exposure to radon, radiation, asbestos, arsenic and some
chemicals.
   The other 1990 predictions included:
   _600,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, the majority of
them curable, and another 27,600 of melanoma, the most serious skin
cancer. There will be 6,300 deaths from melanoma and 2,500 from
other skin cancers.
   _150,000 new breast cancer cases, up from 142,000 last year _
partly due to the aging population. The five-year survival rate for
localized breast cancer has risen from 78 percent in the 1940s to
90 percent today.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of city officials, doctors,
lawyers, educators and religious groups joined gun control activist
Sarah Brady Tuesday in urging prompt congressional action on a bill
to ban 14 specific semi-automatic assault weapons.
   ``This is the first time these fine groups have gathered
together to speak out for sensible gun laws,'' Mrs. Brady, wife of
former Presidential Press Secretary James Brady, said at a news
conference. ``But I'm angry that we have to be here at all.''
   Mrs. Brady's husband was severely wounded during an
assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981.
   The bill supported by Mrs. Brady would ban the import,
manufacture, sale and possession of the 14 weapons. It was approved
last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting action
by the full Senate. She called on Senate leaders to call it up to
the floor this week and ``let the American public know where their
senators stand.''
   Gun owner support groups have opposed the legislation on the
grounds that semi-automatic weapons _ one pull of the trigger fires
one round _ are essentially the same as many hunting rifles, and
would force many sportsmen to give up their weapons.
   Rabbi Lynne Landsberg, assistant director of the Religious
Action Center of Reform Judaism, said at the news conference, ``We
cannot begin to curb crime and the epidemic of random violence
which plagues our cities while we continue to legitimize the
wholesale arming of ordinary citizens, including the mentally
defective and the street gangs.''
   Warren Eisenberg, director of the International Council of B'nai
B'rith, said his organization does not believe the bill would
``interfere with the legitimate activities of sportsmen.''
   ``In an age when hate criminals and narcoterrorists use assault
weapons to commit their crimes, it is ridiculous to try to defend
certain categories of domestic and imported weapons as sporting
equipment,'' Eisenberg said.
   The American Federation of Teachers distributed a statement
supporting the bill as ``a positive first step'' and saying,
``Because of the access people have to semi-automatic assault
weapons, we have to add violent crime to the list of problems
facing our children. We should be doing everything in our power to
insure that American students are protected from violence.''
   Dr. John Seward, member and past chairman of the American
Medical Association Council on Legislation, urged approval of the
legislation, saying, ``As a physician and a county coroner in
Northwestern Illinois, I have seen first-hand the devastating
wounds inflicted by assault weapons fired during violent crimes.''
   Robert Z. Alpern, director of the Washington office of the
Unitarian Universalist Association, said passage of the bill
``would be a small step toward limiting the supply of
semi-automatic weapons that have taken an unconscionable toll of
human lives and terrorized our nation.''
   Stanley Chauvin, president of the American Bar Association,
urged action on the bill ``to prevent a permanent military-like
escalation of drug crime in our nation.''
   Jim Moran, mayor Alexandria, Va., and chairman of the Human
Development Policy Committee of the National League of Cities, said
he spoke for the bill ``on the basis of NLC policy, which I also
happen to fervently and wholeheartedly endorse as a mayor, as a
citizen of my community and as a worried parent, as well.''
   The 14 weapons are the MAC-10 and MAC-11, Steyr Aug, Colt AR-15
and Colt CAR-15, Uzi carbine and Uzi pistol, Beretta AR-70, Galil,
Avtomat Kalashnikovs, FN-FNC, FN-FAL-LAR, Striker 12 Streetsweeper
and TEC-9.

   Attorneys for a man charged in the
disappearance of a multimillionaire's wife rested their case
Tuesday, without putting their client on the stand, after saying a
potential witness wouldn't tell them his location.
   U.S. District Judge Tom Lee told jurors they would hear closing
arguments Wednesday in the kidnapping conspiracy trial of
65-year-old Newton Alfred Winn.
   Winn, prosecutors and defense attorneys spent much of Tuesday
morning in a closed session in chambers with the judge after Winn
and his attorneys disagreed about whether Winn should testify.
   Winn, a St. Petersburg, Fla., attorney, is charged with plotting
the July 26, 1988, kidnapping of Annie Laurie Hearin in Jackson,
and with extortion and perjury. Mrs. Hearin, the wife of Jackson
multimillionaire Robert Hearin, is still missing.
   The defense presented few witnesses.
   Sheriff's Deputy Granville Ratcliff of Cheatham County, Tenn.,
testified he had talked to Marilyn Taylor, then Marilyn Phillips, a
key prosecution witness and Winn's former lover.
   Ratcliff said he talked to her about where to get an
unregistered or stolen license tag. He said he was reasonably
certain the discussion took place in late spring 1988.
   Taylor's testimony, given this past week, implicated Winn in the
kidnapping of Mrs. Hearin.
   Don Ward, a former employee of Winn's, testified as a
prosecution rebuttal witness that he didn't write a postcard Taylor
testified she received from Winn in 1986. The card was signed
``Alice Johnson,'' a name Taylor said she later learned Winn
sometimes used.
   Ward said that while working as a private investigator he
sometimes used the name ``Al Johnson.''
   During the trial Monday, defense attorneys asked the government
to help them locate and subpoena Taylor's ex-husband, Mark
Phillips, who Taylor testified was a mob hit man.
   ``The government informs me it has found Mark Phillips and is
trying to get him to agree to come in,'' defense attorney Ed Marger
said Tuesday before resting the case.
   ``We've talked to him, but he won't tell us where he is,'' sxaid
defense attorney John Colette.
   FBI Agent Patrick McGlenon testified Monday that the FBI found
nothing indicating Phillips was a hit man, was linked to the Mafia
or had any involvement in the kidnapping.
   During cross-examination of Taylor, Marger accused her, Phillips
and Ward of being the masterminds behind the kidnapping.
   On Monday, prosecutor James Tucker named Ward, who was granted
immunity from prosecution, as the person the government thinks
conspired with Winn to kidnap Mrs. Hearin.
   Tucker was arguing against a defense request that the conspiracy
to kidnap charge against Winn be dismissed. The defense had argued
that the government could not pursue a conspiracy case with only
one conspirator. The judge denied the request. No one besides Winn
has been charged.
   Ward testified last week that Winn sent him to Mississippi four
times between 1986 and 1988 to investigate Hearin and his
businesses and photograph the couple's home.
   Hearin is former chief executive officer of School Pictures,
Inc., in which Winn once held a franchise in Florida. Legal
disputes with the company caused Winn to lose real and personal
property in 1988, when he went into bankruptcy.
   ``While it is true Mr. Ward is not willing to admit at this
particular time that Mrs. Hearin was to be kidnapped, he knew Mr.
Winn's situation,'' Tucker said.
   Ward has testified that, at Winn's request, he lied to a federal
grand jury investigating the kidnapping, corroborating Winn's story
that he was with a prostitute in St. Petersburg the day of the
kidnapping.

   The president of the Arab League will lead
a delegation to the Soviet Union to protest the flow of Soviet
Jewish emigration to Israel, league sources said Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, Jordan's King Hussein called for an urgent Arab
summit to forge a unified stand against the influx.
   Israel expects between 300,000 and 500,000 Soviet Jews to arrive
in the next three years, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has
indicated Israel might need the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip
to settle all the arrivals.
   The Palestinians aim to establish an independent state in those
territories, which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War.
   The delegation of Arab diplomats also will visit the United
States, France, Britain and China in their roles as permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, the league sources said.
   Arab League President Chedli Klibi and PLO chief Yasser Arafat
chaired a three-hour closed-door meeting of ministers from Algeria,
Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Tunisia. The ministers form
the standing committee on the Palestinian uprising.
   The gathering marked the first time the committee, formed to
coordinate Arab strategy toward the uprising or ``intefadeh'' in
the occupied terrories, has met in more than a year.
   Hussein, meanwhile, called on Arab leaders to open a dialogue
with the Soviet Union and new governments in East Europe because he
said Israel was attempting to exploit the downfall of Communist
regimes there in its favor.
   He told the daily Al-Watan that the Soviet Jewish influx ``will
add to the Israeli strength already realized as a result of support
it receives from the Jewish and world Zionist movement, the
influence of the extremist Israeli right on the American decision
makers _ at least in the legislative branch _ and the pro-Israel
attitudes of the United States.
   ``Where will these thousands settle? At the expense of whom?''
he asked.
   Hussein said that in talking to Moscow, ``we (Arabs) cannot say
to it that it should not allow its people to exercise their rights,
but at the same time we should warn against the dangers besetting
the rights of Palestinians and the Arabs on their soil.''
   Also Tuesday, 85 members of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinian parliament-in-exile, signed a petition to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, urging him to halt the emigration
of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   ``In the name of human rights, we call on you to quickly
intervene ... to stop Soviet Jewish exodus, which is considered
another Jewish invasion of our homeland,'' the petition said.

   Rock singer Billy Idol was seriously injured
in a motorcycle accident Tuesday and underwent several hours of
surgery to repair a badly broken leg, his publicist and a hospital
spokesman said.
   Idol suffered a serious fracture of his right leg between the
knee and the ankle and a fracture of his left wrist, said Ron Wise,
spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   The singer was brought to Cedars at 9:10 a.m. and was listed in
serious condition while undergoing surgery, Wise said.
   Neither Wise nor Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden, knew details of
the accident except that it involved a car.
   ``He had completed an album and was on his way home. It involved
another car but it wasn't Billy's fault, and he wasn't

   Pap smear screening to detect cervical cancer,
combined with appropriate treatment, could save the lives of many
elderly women, according to a study Tuesday by the Office of
Technology Assessment.
   Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly, will
begin paying for Pap tests in July 1990, and OTA said the screening
will be most cost-effective it is combined with efforts to
encourage high-risk women to be tested.
   According to the study:
   _Women at high risk of cervical cancer are smokers, poor,
non-white, were young at first intercourse and have had multiple
sexual partners.
   _Studies have found that women who have been screened are
one-half to one-tenth as likely to develop cervical cancer as other
women.
   _Elderly women appear to have lower rates of localized,
noninvasive cervical tumors than younger women, but the elderly
have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer and higher death
rates from cervical cancer.
   _Since elderly women are less likely to be screened for cervical
cancer than younger women, older women are more likely to be in
advanced stages of the disease when it is diagnosed.
   Citing National Cancer Institute figures for 1985, the report
said 1.1 white women per 100,000 under 50 _ but 2.4 black women _
died of cervical cancer. Among women over 50, the rate was 7.5 for
whites and 21.1 for blacks.
   The average Medicare payment for a Pap smear will be $11.37,
though actual physician and laboratory charges may be higher, the
report said. The program will cover Pap tests once every three
years.

   Fifteen years after the death of a law
enforcement officer's wife was ruled an accident, her daughter's
long-dormant memories have led authorities to call it a homicide.
   Wilma Anderson Graham died on her kitchen floor in April 1975
with two knife wounds in her heart and other wounds on her hands
and arms _ all suffered during a struggle with her husband, Kenneth
Graham.
   Graham claimed that his wife plunged the knife into her own
chest, then later slipped and fell on the blade as he tried to keep
her from stabbing herself a second time.
   While Alachua County authorities concluded it was an accident,
someone else reached a different conclusion.
   Paula Hearndon, 29, who witnessed at least part of the struggle
between her mother and stepfather said it was murder.
   For 14 years, she said, she suppressed the traumatic memory.
   But a year ago, after repeated flashbacks allowed her to recall
more and more of what happened, she told authorities she remembers
seeing Graham pull the knife out of her mother and stab her again.
   At the request of Gov. Bob Martinez, the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement reopened the investigation.
   In a report released Monday, the department concluded that Mrs.
Graham was the victim of a homicide and that there is ``probable
cause to believe that Kenneth Graham committed'' the crime.
   The report also criticized the chief investigator for the state
attorney's office _ a friend of Graham's _ for overlooking and
discounting key facts during the original investigation.
   When the department took the case to a grand jury last month,
jurors had two choices _ to indict for first-degree murder or not
indict at all. The statute of limitations has expired on any lesser
charge.
   The grand jury declined to issue an indictment. Instead, they
issued a report that is sealed by the court. Ms. Hearndon's
attorneys are seeking to make that report public in hopes of
re-opening the case.
   Graham is a former FBI agent, former Alachua County sheriff's
deputy, police academy instructor, community college security
director and associated with many law enforcement officials in
Gainesville.
   He declined to discuss the case this week, but his attorney,
Larry Turner of Gainesville, said he is convinced that Mrs.
Graham's death was accidental.
   ``The grand jury didn't indict him 14 years ago or this time and
this is what matters,'' Turner said. ``I'm surprised and skeptical
of a sudden restoration of memory after 14 years.
   But Ms. Hearndon and her attorney, Norm LaCoe, suggest that
Graham's close ties to law enforcement caused a miscarriage of
justice 15 years ago, and they are not confident the renewed
investigation will do much more.
   ``I don't have any confidence in anything any more,'' Ms.
Hearndon said last week. ``I want the world to know this guy is a
... murderer.''

<HEAD>Six Senators Call for Aid Cutoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six senators called Tuesday for a complete
cutoff of U.S. aid to El Salvador, saying the millions now sent by
the United States make it ``an accomplice in repression'' and death
squad murders.
   The legislation, which has little chance of passage, was an
apparent effort by Senate liberals to increase pressure on the
government of Alfredo Cristiani to undertake negotiations with
leftist rebels, to pursue further prosecutions in the murders last
year of six Jesuit priests and to reform the military.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said while there has been
progress in the murder investigation _ trials are scheduled to
begin in May for eight military men _ it is ``too little and too
late.''
   ``Serious questions remain about whether justice is being done
in these particularly brutal murders, including whether all those
involved in the massacre have been identified,'' Kennedy said at a
news conference.
   Asked about the case during a visit to Washington last week,
Cristiani said, ``We are not here to do justice by using scapegoats
... or by speculation. We will only go by the results of a
professional investigation.''
   ``The judicial process, at least at the beginning, is working
well and moving forward,'' Cristiani added.
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday
that ``the U.S. government, President Cristiani, (and) the high
command of the Salvadoran military all share the view that heinous
crimes such as these should be investigated and that the
perpetrators should be brought to justice.''
   In addition to Kennedy, sponsors of the bill are Sens. John
Kerry, D-Mass., Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., Paul Simon, D-Ill., Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   Congress, after the murders last year of the priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter, declined to attach strings to U.S.
aid to El Salvador. That aid will total about $315 million this
year, including military, economic, food, and development aid.
   Since then, Cristiani has surprised many by pursuing the case
and bringing indictments against the soldiers.

   An underground electrical accident shut down all
train service to Grand Central Terminal for three hours Tuesday,
authorities said. Ten workers were injured.
   The 12:38 p.m. accident, in a tunnel beneath the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, set off a smoky fire, said Metro-North railroad spokesman
Dan Brucker.
   Limited service into and out of Grand Central resumed at 3:30
p.m., the railroad said, but some tracks were without power.
Widespread track and time changes were expected throughout the
evening rush hour for the railroad's 85,000 daily commuters, a
spokeswoman said.
   By 4 p.m., hundreds of commuters stood in Grand Central Terminal
staring at the indicator board and trying to determine when and
from where their trains might leave. Several trains listed as
delayed had been assigned track numbers and taken on passengers.
   Metro-North employees walked around the station offering
assistance.
   ``Up in Westchester we're a little more civil,'' said Lucille
Declet of Bronxville, north of New York City. ``The farther north
you go, the more that holds true.''
   The lobby crowd was thick but not overflowing, and by 4:45 p.m.
announcements of train departures were coming more frequently.
   Bob Reilly, of Brewster, stood on a staircase and had just
finished complaining: ``It's a mess. Nothing's moving. I knew I
should have taken the bus,'' when the announcer called his train,
the 4:15 p.m.
   After the accident, smoke from the blaze floated up into the
hotel and into the train station a half-dozen blocks away, said
Fire Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla. The fire was
extinguished within about an hour, he said.
   Waldorf spokeswoman Marilyn Marks said smoke got into the lobby,
but ducts were closed immediately and the problem was minor.
   Railroad spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said a 28-ton tamping
machine, used to pack down ballast around the tracks,
``accidentally cut into a third-rail power feeder cable. That cable
shorted out, created that big popping, sizzling explosive sound and
it shorted out along the cable into a splicing chamber where there
are a lot of other cables. ... That's where all the smoke came
from.''
   Ten Metro-North workers suffered smoke inhalation, said Capt.
Ellen Scibelli of the Emergency Medical Service. Three of them were
taken to a hospital, and the others were treated at the scene.

   A Labor Department plan to scale back an
employment program for older Americans came under fire Tuesday from
a Senate chairman who complained it would hurt 10,000 impoverished
senior citizens.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, appearing before a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee to push the agency's $26.3 billion
budget, said the Bush administration chose to cut $14 million from
the program because of overall budget constraints.
   Under the program, older citizens are placed in community
service jobs such as in hospitals, schools and libraries. The jobs
usually pay the minimum wage.
   ``It's a great employment opportunity that keeps elderly
Americans off welfare and gives them some respect, some dignity,''
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa and committee chairman. ``This is one
cut that just does not make sense.''
   President Bush's budget proposes that $343 million be spent on
the program in budget year 1991; $357 million went for it in the
current fiscal year.
   ``It's a result of the budget constraints. I wish that it did
not have to be so,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Harkin, noting that the hourly minimum wage is set to increase
from $3.35 to $4.25 next year, said the job program would require
more funding just to employ the same number of older Americans in
1991 as in the 1990 budget year.
   He suggested funding be restored through the supplemental
appropriations process to account for the minimum wage difference,
but Mrs. Dole said that process should be reserved for ``dire
emergencies.''
   ``Dire emergency is in the eye of the beholder,'' Harkin said.
   On another budget issue, Mrs. Dole said the department's
proposed $252.6 million increase for new youth job training
programs would provide help to an estimated 683,000 of the nation's
``most at-risk youth.''
   ``If we're going to remain competitive in a global market, we
must address ourselves to this skills gap and a motivational gap
that exists in many areas as well,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   She said the department was working on ways to help high school
students make the transition to the workforce, since many now
``kick around for a couple of years trying to find the right spot.''
   Many senators praised the labor secretary for her role in
bringing about a tentative settlement in the Pittston-United Mine
Workers strike, but she again found herself explaining the
government's hands-off approach at Eastern Air Lines, where
machinists remain on strike.
   ``I think you always have to go case by case,'' Mrs. Dole said,
citing different federal labor laws that govern the transportation
industry. She also said the strike was not causing an emergency in
the airline industry.
   ``This was not the kind of situation that would tie up
transportation in a section of the country,'' she said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Party Reform Would Squeeze Out Committee Hard-Liners</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for
reforming the Communist Party would be the climax of a five-year
squeeze play against elderly hard-liners of the Central Committee.
   Gorbachev took the helm of the Communist Party in March 1985 and
since then has almost completely changed the 12-man Politburo,
which handles everyday business. But he still cannot count on a
majority on the 249-member Central Committee, the one body with the
power to fire him.
   To push through radical changes, such as Monday's call for the
party to give up its monopoly on power, Gorbachev needs Central
Committee members who ``pulse with fresh young blood,'' as the
newspaper Argumenti i Fakti put it this week.
   The newspaper, in a scathing indictment of the age and tenure of
the party leadership, noted that 61 percent of the Central
Commmittee members were past retirement age, and some have been in
positions of power almost since Josef Stalin's time. Many were
appointed only to qualify for ``personal pensions'' _lavish
retirement benefits reserved for the nation's elite, the article
found.
   ``The party hardly has the right, having chosen such a Central
Committee, to expect dynamism, revolutionary energy, flexibility
and extraordinary thinking,'' the article concluded.
   Gorbachev's proposal for secret, multicandidate elections of
delegates to the party congress, which elects the Central
Committee, would result in replacing all but perhaps 10 percent of
the current members, estimated Justis Paletskis, ideology secretary
for the breakaway Lithuanian Communist Party.
   Paletskis is one of hundreds of progressive party leaders
invited to attend and speak at this week's crucial Central
Committee meeting. Guests cannot vote on the final document, but
Paletskis said he is certain the election proposal will be approved.
   While Gorbachev is changing the rules of the game at the top,
pressure from rank-and-file communists and non-party members alike
is providing the bottom jaw of the vise.
   High-ranking local party officials were embarrassed in national
elections last year, when voters were given a choice for the first
time in decades. A repeat performance is likely this spring when
elections for local and republic governing councils are held.
   In recent weeks local communist leaders also have been facing a
new phenomenon: large-scale protests that have forced them to quit
their posts. Party leaders in the Siberian petroleum center of
Tyumen, the southern Russian river city of Volgograd, and the
industrial cities of Chernigov in the Ukraine and Sverdlovsk in the
Ural Mountains all were forced out by popular discontent.
   These actions likely will serve as a example for other
disgruntled Soviets.
   Party rules still hobble Gorbachev's maneuvering. They have
prevented him from adding anyone to the Central Committee since the
last party congress in March 1986.
   At that time he managed to change one-third of the group that
had been elected under Leonid I. Brezhnev. But he had been in power
for only a year and his own grip still was tenuous.
   He dropped 10 of his original 108 appointees last April. Another
has died. He promoted 24 in April, but had only the ranks of
candidate members, also chosen in March 1986, from which to choose.
Candidate members do not vote.
   That means only 121 of Central Committee's 249 members, just
less than 50 percent, were appointed under Gorbachev. Many were far
from being strong supporters of reform, and only a handful are
clearly identifiable Gorbachev allies.
   Among rank-and-file Communists, ``many express doubt about the
possibility of the Central Committee as it is currently constituted
to adopt radical decisions about reform,'' Y. A. Gankovsky, a
Siberian party leader, told Tuesday's meeting.
   Gorbachev twice has sought and failed to win a mandatory
retirement age or a limit of two five-year terms for party
officials, in hopes of weeding out more deadwood.
   Most of the 74 people retired last April were so-called ``Dead
Souls.'' Named after a famous Russian novel by Nikolai Gogol, these
are people who have lost the jobs that entitled them to a Central
Committee slot.
   Now, less than a year later, Western diplomats estimate there
are 50 to 60 more dead souls. They include Dzhumber Patiashvili,
the former party chief in Georgia who was ousted after being blamed
for ordering troops to clear a crowd of peaceful independence
protesters, resulting in 19 deaths.
   With the prospect of real political competition coming up on the
horizon, Gorbachev needs to remove such unpopular figures from the
leadership as the party competees for power.

   Eighty percent of the secret police have
been fired, the telephones of opposition activists are no longer
tapped and other reforms are being made in the security services,
the interior minister said Tuesday.
   Gen. Atanas Semerdjiev said a prison camp on the Danube River
island of Belene, ``one of the most typical symbols of the old
regime ... many of whose inmates have been wrongfully convicted,''
would be closed.
   Semerdjiev spent five hours at a meeting of the Communist Party
and opposition leaders condemning past abuses and promising to make
his ministry ``a guardian of society,'' the official news agency
BTA reported.
   He rejected opposition demands for access to secret police files
and a public investigation of state security, citing constitutional
prohibitions he did not specify, the agency said.
   Semerdjiev made his presentation four days after a Communist
Party congress that sought to bridge differences between reformers
and party conservatives seeking to preserve Communist domination of
Bulgarian society.
   Bulgaria has followed its East European neighbors in promising
to remodel the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the
police agencies that have repressed the people with survellience
and force.
   The Communist Party remains in firm control in Bulgaria,
however, and the public s skeptical of the legitimacy of change
even after the election last week of moderate reformers as prime
minister and party leader.
   Although they participate in the weekly negotiations with the
party, opposition leaders have refused to join a provisional
government to run the country until free elections scheduled for
May.
   The Union of Democratic Forces opposition alliance describes the
Communist proposal of a government of ``national concord'' as too
vague and says that, because the party controls Parliament, there
is little chance of a real opposition role.
   In the BTA report of Tuesday's negotiations, the Interior
Ministry was described as becoming ``new and modern ... independent
of any political party and guided solely by the interests of the
people and the state.''
   BTA said the ``traditional'' structures of state security had
been disbanded.
   It quoted Semerdjiev as saying the Security and Protection
Department had been replaced by a security service one-fifth its
size, and that the security service and a new national intelligence
service would report directly to the head of state.
   A new national service for protection of the constitution was
being formed and its composition would be announced to Parliament
soon, the report said.
   Semerdjiev said the criminal investigation unit was being taken
out of the Interior Ministry and would be reorganized as a national
investigation service reporting to Parliament.
   ``We don't want to be regarded as a shield and a sword any
longer,'' he said. ``We want to be seen as a guardian of society
and the people in the noblest sense of the word.''
   He said the Interior Minister employs no more than 50,000 people
and is being reduced ``dramatically, especially in senior
positions.'' BTA quoted him as saying ``those who have committeed
abuses in the past can no longer serve.'' The BTA report said
Semerdjiev told participants in the talks neither their telephones
nor those of ``intellectuals'' were being tapped, and signed a
pledge that no listening devices were installed in Union of
Democratic Forces offices.
   When the minister acknowledged past abuses and apologized,
Premier Andrei Lukanov said without elaborating that he qualified
for an apology because his telephone also had been tapped, BTA
reported.
   Semerdjiev said monitoring would not stop, but would be carried
out in compliance with the constitution, with orders from a court
or prosecutor.

   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is declining
but higher U.S. import prices may be needed to bring the results
wanted by Congress, officials of the Japanese government and
industry said Tuesday.
   ``Congress wants a quick fix, so ... your demand for imports has
to go down,'' said Kazuo Nukazawa, managing director of the
powerful Japan Federation of Economic Organizations.
   He and Masaru Yoshitomi, director of the government's economic
planning agency, gave reporters an array of figures showing strong
growth of American exports to Japan, but accompanied by continued
growth of U.S. imports.
   A better trade balance will mean lowering U.S. demand for
imports by cheapening the value of the U.S. dollar and driving up
the value of the Japanese yen to make Japanese goods cost Americans
more, said Nukazawa.
   The officials suggested an exchange rate of 90-100 yen per
dollar. One dollar currently buys about 145 yen, compared to as few
as 120 yen last year, 240 yen in 1985 and 360 yen for several years
after World War II.
   Some economists said those proposals could translate into
lowered consumption by Americans, triggering a recession.
   But ``our confidence in the American economy is much higher than
your confidence,'' Nukazawa said, predicting there would be no
recession if the United States maintains a modest 1 percent to 1.5
percent annual economic growth.
   ``The best thing,'' he said, would be to induce the American
people to spend less and save more to provide more investment
capital. The slowly rising U.S. savings rate is 4 percent to 5
percent, compared to 12 percent in Western Europe, he said.
   Japanese real estate investors are becoming hesitant about
buying up U.S. ``landmark properties,'' such as skyscrapers and New
York's Rockefeller Center, because theose investors are becoming
aware of the negative public reaction aroused in the United States
by high-profile purchases, Nukazawa said.
   Predicting the criticism of foreigners ``buying up America''
would blow over, he said the United States ``has a very strong
stomach; it can digest almost everything. Now you love Gorby, two
years ago you hated him,'' Nukazawa said, referring to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Nukazawa and Yoshitomi have been holding informal talks with
officials of the Bush administration, members of Congress and
business leaders in Washington and New York.

<HEAD>Local Official's $245,000 Quadruple Dipping Believed Unique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Housing and Urban Development officials said
Tuesday they have found no evidence that quadruple dipping salary
abuses uncovered in a local New Jersey housing authority exist
elsewhere but added they are expanding an investigation to find out.
   ``We are informed this is a unique situation,'' HUD General
Counsel Frank Keating told a House subcommittee. ``We're in the
process of expanding this nationally.''
   HUD officials said they will first put together strike forces to
examine 20 more local housing agencies in New Jersey.
   ``It may well be there are no other Passaics,'' Keating said.
   Paul Adams, the department's inspector general, said the federal
government was likely defrauded when the Passaic, N.J., Housing
Authority's commissioners approved more than $245,000 in 1988 to
pay Executive Director Paul Marguglio four salaries for four job
titles.
   ``I think that's a reasonable assumption,'' Adams told Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., adding that his office is conducting a criminal
investigation of the Passaic agency.
   Lantos, chairman of the House Government Operations employment
and housing subcommittee, questioned how Marguglio could ``find
enough hours in the day to perform two full-time jobs and two
part-time jobs ... and still have enough time left over to earn
$47,115 for time-and-a-half compensatory pay.''
   Local housing authority executives are prohibited from earning
overtime compensation, Adams said.
   Lantos also questioned the $95,000 paid between January 1986 and
April 1988 to Marguglio's wife, Louise, including $50,000 in
disability pay that an audit called improper. The audit said Mrs.
Marguglio worked ``only one day'' in that period.
   ``It seems to me this was a system designed to fail,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``This was a ripoff and it was a ripoff
in which the commissioners participated.''
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Jan. 22 suspended Marguglio and
four other Passaic officials and authorized a strike force to
examine housing authorities across New Jersey, including Perth
Amboy.
   Under extensive questioning, Paul Kane, HUD's regional inspector
general for the Northeast, acknowledged problems in Passaic were
first hinted at in a 1985 report.
   Rep. Donald Payne, a Newark, N.J., Democrat, called it
unconscionable that HUD failed to pursue tenant complaints as far
back as 1982 to then-Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   Marguglio and his wife declined to testify Tuesday and face
subpoenas if they do not volunteer to appear at the next session on
the Passaic agency, Lantos said.
   Three of Passaic's suspended housing officials _ August C.
Michaelis, chief counsel to the agency; Peter Marrocco, the
authority's chairman, and William P. Scruggs, the board's vice
chairman _ have indicated willingness to testify, Lantos said.
   A federal judge in Newark on Thursday will review last week's
decision to grant HUD temporary control of the authority. Three of
the suspended officials have filed papers seeking reinstatement.
   Lantos' decision to call the hearing marks a resumption of last
year's subcommittee focus on the multi-billion-dollar scandal of
influence-peddling, fraud and mismanagement at HUD during the
Reagan administration.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last week asked a federal court
to appoint an independent counsel to investigate fraud allegations
against former Pierce and others.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afternoons at the beach, jobs and summer
loves will have to be squeezed into the schedule of Los Angeles
public school students as the traditional three-month vacation
becomes a thing of the past.
   Beginning in July 1991, all 646 schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District will go on a year-round schedule; 102 Los
Angeles schools already operate year-round.
   The plan will about double the number of U.S. schools on
year-round schedules and provide an impetus for other districts to
adopt such plans, proponents said.
   ``It will put increasing pressure on other city districts to
re-evaluate the wisdom of remaining on an agriculturally based
calender,'' said Charles Ballinger, executive director of the
National Council on Year-Round Education in San Diego.
   Approved by a 4-3 school board vote Monday, it is intended to
ease severe school overcrowding in the 594,802-student Los Angeles
district, second in size only to New York City's district.
   For 10th-grader Michelle Smith, the new schedule will cut into
her traditional summer plans and social life.
   ``I don't like it because all my friends go to private school
and they don't have year-round school. So I can't be with them,''
she said. ``I also won't be able to go to summer camp, which is all
summer long.''
   But Sarah Ponce, another 10th-grader, said she's keeping an open
mind.
   ``I'd be willing to try it. It's a new experience. Maybe I'd be
able to do different things, like over the winter,'' she said.
``Maybe it would conflict with a lot of things. But I could
probably work around it.''
   What most concerns many parents and students is the year-round
schedule's overlapping ``track'' system of enrollment, in which
different blocks of students begin the year at different times and
have different vacations.
   All students will have shorter summer vacations and longer
winter vacations. Most students will have the same number of days
off as before, but some will have to go a week or two extra.
   The system will give schools as many as four student body
presidents _ one for each track _ and disrupt interscholastic
sports.
   ``My feeling is that you're going to lose some kids from teams
when they're off track and on vacation or something. You could lose
a key kid and cost you a full season,'' said Duane LaRue, athletic
director at University High School.
   Parents expressed mixed emotions about year-round schools.
   Some were happy that the schools should be less crowded and
their children will be home fewer summer days, but others
complained the schedule will disrupt vacation plans and leave them
with children around the house during the winter.
   ``We have parents who think it's wonderful and we have parents
who think it's the worse thing that ever happened. It depends on
their lifestyle,'' said Barbara Topkis, president of one of the two
Parent-Teacher Association districts in Los Angeles.
   Students and teachers at the schools now on year-round schedules
said the plan works well, with only a few minor glitches.
   Yanira Perez, a 10th-grader, said the year-round schedule still
leaves time to work at a clothing store after work and gives her
more hours to work over the winter when many students are still in
school.
   ``A lot of students like it this way. We're all used to it,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   India on Tuesday accused Pakistan of
causing border tensions and said it was prepared militarily for any
threat from Islamabad.
   ``We urge upon Pakistan authorities to heed to our request and
scale down the propaganda level,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab
Seth said.
   Indian border guards fired Monday on a mob of 4,000 Pakistani
protesters, some of whom crossed into Indian territory in the
northern state of Jammu-Kashmir, where Moslem separatists are
demanding independence.
   Officials said no Pakistanis were killed but Indian newspapers
and Pakistani officials reported deaths.
   The Indian government began a crackdown on Moslem separatists in
the Kashmir region of Jammu-Kashmir state on Jan. 20, and at least
77 Indians have been killed in clashes between protesters and
security forces.
   Police sources said Moslem militants Tuesday bombed an empty bus
on the outskirts of Srinagar, Kashmir's largest town, and threw a
grenade at a paramilitary patrol, wounding three people.
   Amnesty International said Monday that Indian security forces
searched for survivors at the height of the protests last month in
order to kill them. The Lonon-based human rights group, quoting
witnesses, also said some protesters were shot from behind.
   It acknowledged that security forces faced a difficult situation
in maintaining order and also that police were killed in the
clashes.
   But it called for an investigation into the killings and urged
the governor of Jammu-Kashmir to order troops not to use lethal
force on demonstrators unless their own lives were at risk.
   Indian officials said about 10 people were wounded Monday during
the Pakistani border demonstration.
   Pakistani officials said one person was killed and 13 were shot
in the legs. Two Indian newspapers also reported fatalities. The
pro-government Times of India said 10 people were killed, while The
Statesman, an independent paper, said three died.
   ``We do not want to sound alarmist (but) we regard all such
unprovoked incidents as serious,'' Seth said.
   ``We are fully prepared on (the) military level,'' Seth said. He
did not elaborate.
   Seth said three more anti-Indian demonstrations were held on the
Pakistan side of the frontier Tuesday but that the protesters did
not try to cross into India.
   Both days the demonstrators shouted slogans in protest of
India's crackdown on the Moslem separatists.
   The Pakistan-based leader of Moslem militants who support the
separatist movement in India promised Tuesday to rein in his
emotionally charged followers.
   ``I have issued a sort of martial law order to our people today
to not storm across'' the border, said Amanullah Khan, chairman of
the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
   His decree generated threats of mutiny, particularly among
student in his organization, Khan said in Islamabad, Pakistan's
capital. But greater tension between India and Pakistan would hurt
their cause, he said: ``If there is a war we'll be sandwiched in
between and made a scapegoat.''
   India accuses Pakistan of aiding the militants in Kashmir, a
predominantly Moslem region claimed both by India and Pakistan.
Pakistan routinely denies the charge but says it supports the
separatists' quest for self-determination.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are Moslem,
making it the only Moslem-majority state among predominantly Hindu
India's 25 states.
   India and Moslem Pakistan were formed largely along religious
lines when the Indian subcontinent gained independence from Britain
in 1947.
   Jammu-Kashmir is part of a larger Kashmir that was divided into
Indian and Pakistani segments after the nations went to war in
1948. A U.N. monitored cease-fire line separates the regions.
   The two countries went to war again over Kashmir in 1965, but
the border question is still unresolved.

<HEAD>Excommunicated Black Priest Will Keep Title</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dissident black Roman Catholic priest George
A. Stallings said Tuesday he will remain a priest despite his
formal separation from the church and the creation of his
independent African-American Catholic congregation.
   ``The church teaches you that once a priest, always a priest,''
Stallings said. ``I have also stated...that the Roman Catholic
Church cannot excommunicate me or anyone else.''
   The Archdiocese of Washington on Monday issued a statement
saying Stallings effectively excommunicated himself following his
public renunciation of church teaching.
   Stallings also declared that there was nothing in Catholic
doctrine that prohibited the use of birth control or prohibited
women from being priests.
   The priest announced recently that his African-American
congregation would an autonomous and independent congregation that
would no longer answer to Rome.
   Eileen Marx, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said Tuesday
that Stallings would remain a priest, but one no longer associated
with the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``It is true that in the Catholic Church once a priest always a
priest, but the church can also regulate who is to speak in her
name,'' Ms. Marx said. ``He is no longer authorized to speak as a
Roman Catholic priest in the church's name.''
   Stallings said his formal separation from the Catholic Church
would allow his own congregation to solidify its discipline and
laws.
   ``We have no desire to in any way denounce our Catholicism,'' he
told reporters. ``And we will remain true to revealed doctrine of
the Catholic faith and continue to give full expression of
Catholicism out of an African-American perspective.''
   Stallings said that ``revealed'' doctrine will include the
ordination of women, the marriage of priests, the use of birth
control and allowing divorced or remarried Catholics to be in full
communion without the annulment process.
   ``The African-American Catholic congregation holds to the
sanctity of life from the moment of conception to birth,''
Stallings said. ``But ultimately it is the responsibility of the
woman who must stand before God to render an account for her action
and her conduct to make that decision for which only she alone can
be held responsible.''

   A U.S. Air Force A-10 ground attack plane crashed
Tuesday in Wales, killing the pilot, less than 18 hours after two
airmen died when an Air Force F-111 bomber crashed off east
England, the Air Force said.
   Gen. Marcus Anderson, commander of the 3rd Air Force division,
grounded all British-based U.S. tactical fighters for a one-day
safety review, although press spokesman Capt. Raymond Martell said
the crashes were unrelated.
   He called it ``a terrible coincidence'' they occurred in so
short a span.
   The air force said no suggestions emerged of mechanical faults
in the jets.
   Martell said the A-10 crashed in the Black Mountains of Wales,
about eight miles south of Hay-on-Wye on the English border. The
name of the pilot, the lone occupant, was not released.
   The plane was stationed at the British air force base at
Alconbury, 20 miles northwest of Cambridge.
   On Monday, an F-111 carrying two men crashed in a North Sea bay
during a routine training mission.
   The air force identified the two men aboard as Capt. Clifford W.
Massengill, 30, of Edenton, N.C., the pilot, and 1st Lt. Thomas G.
Dorsett, 26, of Pensacola, Fla. One body, so far unidentified, was
recovered. A search for the second airman continued.
   The F-111 was based at Upper Heyford, 50 miles northwest of
London, one of two bases here for 84 U.S. bombers, which are
capable of carrying nuclear arms.

   Authorities captured a man reputed to be
a leading cocaine trafficker and said he was carrying a list that
included the name of former Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   Jesus Humberto Vega Escobar, arrested Monday in Bogota, is
wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of shipping 6 tons of cocaine
into the country, according to the daily El Tiempo.
   The Bogota newspaper said the government had begun extradition
proceedings.
   Vega Escobar allegedly controlled an important cocaine
transportation network in Panama, Central America and Mexico for
shipments to the United States, the newspaper said.
   A national police spokesman reached by telephone confirmed Vega
Escobar's capture but said he could not comment on El Tiempo's
report that a list containing Noriega's name was found in the
suspect's possession.
   Colombia has sent 14 trafficking suspects to the United States
since August, when the administration of President Virgilio Barco
intensified a crackdown on the country's cocaine cartels.
   Vega Escobar, a resident of Medellin, was reportedly working for
Pablo Escobar, the most important figure in the powerful cocaine
cartel based in that city.
   El Tiempo said Noriega's was the first of 28 names on the list
and apparently was a guide to Vega Escobar's organization. The list
also contained the names of businessmen in Panama and Mexico, the
newspaper said.
   Noriega was ousted from power in Panama during the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion. The former chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces, who
controlled the country, is awaiting trial on drug trafficking
charges in Miami.
   El Tiempo quoted a police spokesman as saying authorities
captured Vega Escobar in a raid on his luxury apartment in the
capital after being tipped off by area residents.

   Civil rights forces split Tuesday as the NAACP
promised not to fight confirmation of conservative Clarence Thomas
as an appeals judge, while other groups assailed his record as
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   ``While we cannot give him our unqualified endorsement, we will,
however, not oppose the nomination,'' NAACP executive director
Benjamin L. Hooks said in a statement as the Senate Judiciary
Committee conducted its confirmation hearing.
   Thomas, 41, one of the more prominent blacks in the Reagan and
Bush administrations, came in for criticism from representatives of
working women and senior citizens groups.
   The nomination of Thomas to succeed Robert Bork on the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington once appeared likely to trigger
concerted resistance from the cvil rights community.
   In recent days, however, the NAACP balked. Hooks did say that
``we do have questions about his management of EEOC.''
   Thomas told the senators that as an appeals judge he would not
``have the option of roaming unfettered through judicial terrain''
and injecting his personal views into decisions.
   He vowed ``to faithfully adhere to the Supreme Court decisions''
and not ``torture a case to reach a preconceived notion of what a
result should be.''
   Thomas acknowledged that the statute of limitations on 900 cases
of alleged bias against the elderly lapsed before the commission
acted on them. He accepted responsibility. ``It happened on my
watch,'' he said.
   But he said the reason was that he intiated more extensive
investigative procedures and the new program may have been ``too
ambitious.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., told Thomas there as ``a lot of
debate'' over whether the correct number was 13,000 cases rather
than 900.
   Thomas said: ``With regard to the number 13,000, I don't have
the slightest idea where that number comes from.''
   Thomas said in response to a question that as a conservative he
holds a number of positions at odds with ``an expected orthodoxy
from black Americans.'' He said criticism from civil rights groups
over his views ``is something that is uncomfortable, but it is
something that I'll have to live with.''
   ``I think the choice between principle and popularity is
something that each individual will have to make and I've made mine
and I'll live with the consequences,'' Thomas said.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., who twice hired Thomas as an aide,
praised him as ``a person who calls them as he sees them.''
   ``Frankly, I have questions about the nominee's commitment to
the law,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. He said,
however: ``We haven't always agreed, but I respect your views.''
   Nancy Kreiter of Chicago, research director of the Women
Employed Institute, told the committee that under Thomas the
commission ``failed to fulfill its mandate to protect the rights of
victims of discrimination.''
   ``Mr. Thomas' actions in the areas of policy and enforcement
performance demonstrate a lack of respect for law and a disregard
for individuals,'' she said. `` ... A careful look at his record
raises serious questions about his qualifications for a lifetime
appointment to administer justice on the federal bench.''
   She said enforcement by the commission has been lax while there
has been slippage in staff competence.
   Rutgers law professor Alfred W. Blumrose, an advocate of rights
for senior citizens, told the committee that the commission had
apparently violated its own regulations by eliminating a policy of
persuing hiring goals and timetables in 1985 without taking any
formal action under the federal government's ``sunshine'' law.
   He said there was a ``sort of quiet suggestion by innuendo
leading the lawyers in the agency to alter the process.'' He said
he believed the action to be illegal. ``The agency can suspend the
policy ... what they cannot do is simply slide away from the
policy,'' he said.

   A commission has been established to
investigate complaints against security forces that put down the
violent ethnic unrest in Kosovo Province, the police chief said
Tuesday.
   Chief Jusuf Karakusi told Kosovo's parliament that 26 ethnic
Albanians had been killed in clashes with police since the latest
round of protests started Jan. 24. He said 94 demonstrators had
been wounded by gunfire and 83 police officers had suffered various
injuries.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
people and thousands have taken to the streets to demand more
autonomy for the province, which is part of the republic of Serbia.
   Serbia tightened its control of Kosovo's police, judiciary and
schools last year, saying the measures were necessary to protect
the Serbian minority in the province. The actions sparked violent
demonstrations and Kosovo has been under virtual martial law for a
year.
   Ethnic Albanian leaders have been critical of what they call
indiscriminate use of force by security forces seeking to quell the
recent unrest.
   One ethnic Albanian delegate, Cemail Bairam, told parliament he
had witnessed uncontrolled shooting by police in the village of
Malisevo.
   He said the killings ``cannot be justified by anything.''
   Until an investigation identifies those responsible, tension
will remain high in Kosovo, Bairam said.
   The security forces, backed by columns of tanks and low-flying
air force jets and helicopters, have kept an uneasy calm, and no
additional deaths have been reported since Feb. 2.
   Karakusi told the legislature about 1,000 protesters had been
arrested, and that 200 of them had been sentenced by magistrate
courts to up to 60 days in jail.
   Tensions rose Tuesday night in Janjevo, a town 16 miles
southwest of Pristina, when a Serbian police officer, apparently
drunk, shot two ethnic Albanian teen-age boys in the legs and
harassed residents, the mayor and other witnesses said.
   The officer opened fire after he was seen drinking at a bar,
Mayor Josip Dodid said. He said the boys were hospitalized for
treatment and that the unidentified officer was arrested.
   About 20,000 people massed on the downtown street in front of
the parliament Tuesday to pay homage to those killed in the
protests.
   As car horns sounded, people in the crowd raised their hands in
the V for victory salute and shouted ``Glory to the dead!'' They
then dispersed peacefully as police watched.
   Ethnic Albanians also observed a minute of silence at 2 p.m. for
a second day in honor of the dead.
   About 20,000 people gathered in the provincial capital of
Pristina Tuesday night, lighting thousands of candles they then
left on sidewalks.
   Protest leaders have called for the release of jailed ethnic
Albanian activists and free elections to replace provincial
officials they say are loyal to Serbia.
   The leadership of Yugoslavia's liberal northern republic of
Slovenia called for the lifting of the yearlong state of emergency
in Kosovo.
   The presidency of the Slovenian Socialist Alliance, a
Communist-dominated mass organization, said the problems of the
region ``should be resolved by democratic means'' and appealed for
an end to ``demonstrations of force ... by the Serbian leadership.''
   Slobodan Milosevic, the president of the Serbian republic, has
accused Slovenia and neighboring Croatia of supporting Albanian
``terrorists'' in Kosovo.

   The army said Tuesday it has begun punishing
Palestinians who hurl rocks at Israelis by sealing off their houses
or blocking off individual rooms.
   The policy, which could affect hundreds of families in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, drew immediate criticism from
civil rights groups and liberal politicians, who said the measure
amounts to collective punishment.
   Also Tuesday, two Israeli civilians shot and killed a
Palestinian who stoned their truck and 33 other Palestinians were
wounded in clashes with Israeli troops, the army and Arab reports
said.
   Col. Ahaz Ben-Ari, the army's legal adviser for the West Bank,
said the new penalty was necessary because of ``the danger of
stone-throwing,'' the main tactic of the nearly 26-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   ``Because this phenomenon is still deeply rooted and, lately to
our great regret, is on an increase, it was decided to widen this
sanction for this phenomenon in an attempt to quell it,'' Ben-Ari
said.
   Since the Arab uprising broke out in December 1987, the army has
destroyed or sealed at least 395 homes to punish Arabs suspected of
firebomb or other serious attacks. But the penalty was not usually
used for rock-throwing.
   The army generally seals rooms, or whole houses, by blocking the
doors and windows with concrete blocks or bricks and cement.
Sometimes the family is told to do the labor. At times, the army
has welded metal doors or shutters shut.
   The first sealings under the new policy occurred overnight in
the West Bank. The army said several rooms of a house in Nablus
were blocked off because one family member threw a rock through a
car's windshield, injuring the Israeli driver.
   In the town of Qalqilya, several rooms were sealed off in the
home of a Palestinian charged with wounding a border policeman with
a stone.
   The families were allowed to remain in one room of each house,
the army said. It did not say how many members there were in each
family.
   Also Tuesday, Mustafa Abed Kulab, 45, a Palestinian bus driver,
was fatally shot when Israeli civilians opened fire after their
fuel truck was stoned in Nablus, Arab reports said.
   The army said police were questioning the driver and his
security guard, who said they fired in the air after the stoning.
   Kulab's death raised to 652 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the Palestinian uprising began.
   In addition, 181 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 22 Palestinians were shot and
wounded by Israeli troops in stone-throwing clashes in the Rafah
refugee camp, Arab reports said.
   They said the clashes broke out as students were leaving their
schools and that the injured ranged in age from 13 to 17.
   Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes
elsewhere in the coastal strip, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed four injuries and said it was checking
further.
   The new house sealing policy was immediately challenged by
Parliament member Dedi Zucker of the left-leaning Citizens Rights
Movement as ``another escalation of the circle of hate.'' He said
it constituted ``punishment without trial.''
   Khaled Batrawi of Law in the Service of Man, a Palestinian-run
human rights group, said the policy was illegal.
   Demolitions and house sealings ``constitute collective
punishment that is prohibited by international law, and they
violate the 4th Geneva Convention,'' he said.
   The 4th Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory,
protects the rights of civilians during war and under occupation.
   The United States and international human rights organizations
also have repeatedly criticized demolitions and sealings, noting
that the action almost always takes place before the suspect is
tried.
   Liberal Parliament members have proposed legislation that would
make the 4th Geneva Convention part of Israeli law.
   Amnon Rubinstein, a member of the left-wing Shinui Party, said
the legislation would oblige Israel to honor the humanitarian
regulations.

   Senate negotiators have reached tentative
compromises on several key portions of clean-air legislation,
including tighter controls on toxic industrial releases, Senate
sources said Tuesday.
   Progress also was made toward an agreement over tighter emission
controls from automobiles with discussion of a proposal aimed at
easing auto industry opposition, the sources said.
   But the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
cautioned that major parts of the pollution-control package,
including the one dealing with acid rain, have yet to be considered
and even the compromises already worked out are tenuous.
   ``Right now you're in the middle of some very delicate
bargaining,'' said one Senate staff member.
   As negotiators broke after a day-long session, Senate sources
said a tentative compromise had been reached on auto questions
between Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., who has been a strong opponent of tougher auto
exhauswt controls.
   While the Mitchell-Levin compromise would retain tough
second-stage tailpipe standards scheduled to go into effect in the
year 2003, it leaves a way for the Environmental Protection Agency
to return to Congress in six years to scrap those requirements.
   The compromise also eliminates a provision that automakers
develop cars with greater fuel efficiency by meeting new carbon
dioxide emission requirements, a portion of the Senate bill that
environmentalists have argued is key to dealing with global warming.
   One source close to the discussions said the Bush administration
had not yet agreed to the compromise, however.
   Additionally, Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and John Chafee,
R-R.I., the two floor leaders of the bill, were said to be unhappy
about the revised auto tailpipe agreement.
   While not commenting directly on the compromises, Baucus said
Tuesday he wants to ``make sure that all that has been written
(into the legislation) in public is not unwritten in these closed
sessions.''
   The private meetings, which have been going on for more than a
week, include the Democratic and Republican leadership as well as
senior officials from both the Enviornmental Protection Agency and
the White House.
   ``Good progress is being made,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has been orchestrating the private
talks.
   The Senate clean-air bill, which is tougher on polluters than
either a House version or legislation sought by President Bush, has
been the target of intense attack by industry, especially utilities
and automakers, who charge it is far too costly and restrictive.
   Mitchell said he hoped to reach overall agreement on the
legislation this week, but acknowledged that he has yet to gather
enough support to head off a possible filibuster when the bill is
taken up on the Senate floor in the coming days.
   ``I think that is a probability,'' Mitchell said when asked
about a potential filibuster, which would stall progress on the
legislation.
   In addition to the pollution controls on automobiles, according
to the sources, the private talks also have produced tentative
agreements on:
   _A provision requiring industry to install the best available
technology to curb toxic chemical releases and eventually meet
specific health standards based on cancer risk.
   The compromise, however, would make it easier for industrial
plants to avoid the health-standard requirement because it requires
the EPA to adopt a ``real world'' procedure taking into account
circumstances at specific plant sites to determine cancer risks
instead of the mathematical models now used.
   _Tougher pollution controls on a broad range of businesses and
industrial plants in urban areas that are failing to meet federal
air quality standards. The compromise, however, exempts smaller
polluters by raising the cutoff for emission levels.
   In addition, there is agreement that the bill would contain no
requirement for automakers to produce or sell alternative-fuel
automobiles. Chafee and other senators had hoped to insert such a
requirement on the Senate floor.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>

   Power supplies were disrupted, public
transport was halted and ports remained closed Tuesday as the
country's unions pressed their challenge of government austerity
policies.
   Public Power Corp. employees began a 48-hour nationwide strike
and demanded a 4.3 percent wage increase over inflation, which was
14.1 percent last year.
   Power failures occurred in the capital periodically, and the
fire department reported 750 people had been trapped in elevators.
Traffic lights worked only intermittently, creating chaos at
intersections.
   The country's 2,800 longshoremen entered their fourth day of an
indefinite strike for higher pay, and bus drivers staged a walkout,
also demanding raises.
   The port workers' strike has created a backlog of cargo ships
waiting to enter Piraeus, the country's main port.
   Several unions have staged crippling strikes in key industries
since the beginning of the year, demanding the government back down
on its austerity policy and continue to hire public employees.
   The nation's largest labor organization, the General
Confederation of Greek Labor, warned that it will call on its 1.3
million members to stage a 24-hour general strike this month, the
second this year.
   The organization is demanding a ``national general labor
agreement'' that would include assurances of wage increases over
inflation. The Federation of Greek Industrialists so far has
refused to consider this.
   Premier Xenophon Zolotas has said repeatedly that his government
cannot raise wages in the face of inflation expected to run at 17
percent this year and a $1.8 billion budget deficit.
   Zolotas said Monday the government could do no more than repeat
a promise to protect present wages from inflation.
   He chastized trade unions for staging daily protests in central
Athens, blocking streets and occupying public buildings. He said
the demonstrations presented a climate of anarchy and discouraged
foreign investment.
   The 85-year-old Zolotas was appointed to head a government
coalition after inconclusive elections in November.
   The government is supported by the conservative, socialist and
Communist parties and has a mandate to work on economic problems
before holding elections on April 8.

<HEAD>Protest Movement at Berkeley to be Honored with Monument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artists, professors and veterans of the
free speech movement on Tuesday unveiled finalists in a contest to
commemorate the protest that was the forerunner of a decade of
dissent.
   The proposals for the monument, to be built with private
donations and given to the University of California at Berkeley,
include a metal soap box; a suspended electronic billboard
broadcasting computer messages from around the world; giant cracks
in a plaza; bricks inscribed with speeches; and an ``autonomous
nation'' within a 6-inch circle.
   ``The idea of freedom of speech and action should be
memorialized and done so in the place where it all started,'' said
Peter Selz, former chief curator of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York and a project organizer.
   The sculpture, to be commissioned with $70,000, has revived a
bitter debate over the movement's legacy at Berkeley, which sparked
four months of demonstrations in 1964 after the school banned
political activities on campus.
   Student tactics, including sit-ins, humorous music fetes and an
alternative press, became the model for the 10 years of civil
rights and anti-war demonstrations that followed.
   Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman suggested that he may refuse the
artwork, saying he's unsure the movement deserves an honor.
   In his only public comment on the proposal, he wrote in a letter
to project organizers that those involved in the movement were
``not very good at designing public art to commemorate their own
actions.''
   Journalism Professor David Littlejohn derided it as a tribute to
the ``unjustified self-assurance'' of the campus liberal elite,
which he characterizes as ironically intolerant of divergent views.
   The free speech movement began Oct. 1, 1964, when student Mario
Savio and friend Jack Weinberg began distributing political
material on the university's Sproul Plaza.
   Weinberg was arrested and placed in the back of a patrol car,
but hundreds of students surrounded the automobile and for 32 hours
refused to let 600 police officers take him into custody.
   Photographs of Savio and others addressing the crowd from atop
the car were published around the world, leading to sympathetic
student strikes until the university dropped its ban several months
later.
   The protests culminated in a December sit-in at Sproul Hall
where 773 people were taken into custody, then the largest mass
arrest in California history.
   ``I feel there's a lot of pride among students today in the
students who were here before us,'' said Matthew Miller, an
architecture student and a member of the committee that selected
the finalists from 277 applications.
   The proposals will be displayed at the University Art Museum
through March 3, after which the committee and project organizers
will announce the winner. The public can register their favorite
with ballots.
   At a Tuesday news conference, committee members, including
internationally known artists, said the proposals would be refined
and possibly modified. They reserved the right to combine several
of the ideas.
   Charles Schwartz, a physics professor since 1960, devised the
idea of the monument last year after finding a recently installed
campus statue of two black bears, which he labeled ``big, fat,
powerful, complacent _ representative of the worst of California.''
   Since then, the proposal has receieved support from 100
professors, politicians, students and most of the leaders of the
free speech movement.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Investment Ban Should Go When Mandela Is Free</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Thursday a
ban on new investment in South Africa should be lifted when
President F.W. de Klerk's government frees imprisoned black leader
Nelson Mandela.
   She said reforms de Klerk announced Friday had been welcomed
internationally and, ``as we agreed both at the last meeting of the
European Community and in the Commonwealth, it is necessary to have
encouragement for such steps as well as chastisement for what has
not yet been done.''
   ``We do believe that, when Mr. Mandela is released, it would be
advisable to release some of the very minor sanctions ... in
particular the voluntary ban on new investment,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said in the House of Commons.
   At Britain's insistence, foreign ministers of the 12-nation
European Community will review sanctions against South Africa at a
Feb. 20 meeting in Dublin, Ireland.
   Diplomatic sources said the Netherlands and Portugal also want
to ease restrictions, but Ireland, which holds the rotating
six-month presidency of the community, feels no action should be
taken.
   Mrs. Thatcher, an opponent of sanctions, lifted academic and
cultural restrictions within minutes of de Klerk's announcement
Friday. Among other things, he legalized the African National
Congress guerrilla movement and promised Mandela would be freed
soon.
   British opposition parties and the Anti-Apartheid Movement
criticized her. They feel sanctions should be maintained until
apartheid is abolished.
   Some sanctions imposed by Britain are mandatory under
international agreements, including a ban on arms exports and the
import of South African iron, steel and Krugerrand gold coins.
   Voluntary measures could be lifted by Britain unilaterally or
after persuading some others to follow suit in the European
Community or the 49-nation Commonwealth, the association of Britain
and its former colonies.
   Non-binding measures include bans on investment and tourism
promotion.
   Mrs. Thatcher reacted mildly to the expulsions from South Africa
earlier Tuesday of two British journalists who were covering the
tour of an unofficial English cricket team.
   ``We have told the South African authorities that we regret
these expulsions,'' she said, then noted that South Africa said one
was working illegally on a tourist visa and the other filed a vivid
account of police breaking up a demonstration he had not witnessed.
   Before leaving Johannesburg, Paul Weaver, a sports writer with
the London newspaper Today acknowledged he had not seen the
demonstration, the British news agency Press Association reported,
but it quoted him as saying:
   ``I saw the bloodstains which remained after the police had used
dogs and tear gas on demonstrators and I spoke to many people who
were there at the time.''
   The other expelled journalist was Gareth Furby of Independent
Radio News, whose reports, the government in Pretoria said, were
``intended to damage South Africa's image.''

   King Fahd has met with 25 members of
the Council on Foreign Relations led by banker David Rockefeller,
the official Saudi Press Agency reported Tuesday.
   It said the meeting with the U.S. government, academic, and
business leaders was held Monday. The Foreign Relations Council is
based in New York.
   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister and acting minister of planning,
sat in on the meeting on ``bilateral relations and ... regional and
international issues of mutual concern.''
   Also present at the two-hour meeting were Mohammed Ibrahim
Massoud, acting acting information minister, and Abdul-Rahman
al-Mansouri, foreign affairs undersecretary.
   Included in the Council delegation were Richard Murphy, former
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian
Affairs; political fundraiser Pamela Harriman; and publisher Mort
Zuckerman.
   The Americans held separate meetings with Minister of Finance
and Economy Mohammed Abal-Khail; Prince Salman, governor of Riyadh;
Prince Sultan, the defense minister, and Ibrahim Tawfiq, the deputy
trade minister.
   Saudi Arabia has close military and economic ties with the

<HEAD>Experts Say Community Action Key to Ending Gang Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Escalating gang violence despite increased
arrests and prosecutions is forging an alliance between community
groups and law enforcement, participants in a state summit on gangs
said Tuesday.
   Educators, law enforcement authorities and leaders of community
programs were taking part in a two-day conference to fight gang
influence in neighborhoods.
   State and local law enforcement authorities, who have seen death
tolls rise from gang violence, said enlisting people in
gang-plagued neighborhoods may be the only hope in fighting the
problem.
   ``I don't think that we can any longer assume that by putting
more and more gang members and drug dealers into jail we are going
to force them somehow into submission,'' said Los Angeles police
Cmdr. Lorne Kramer.
   ``Communities need to be mobilized. We definitely need to
develop more comprehensive preventative programs.''
   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department figures show 554
gang-related homicides in the county in 1989, exceeding the record
452 homicides in 1988.
   There are an estimated 80,000 gang members today in the Los
Angeles area, up from 30,000 in 1980, said Steve Valdivia,
executive director of the city's anti-gang agency, Community Youth
Gang Services.
   The conference, which ends Wednesday, focused on training small
community organizations to work together and with law enforcement
in developing and expanding programs to help neighborhoods rid
themselves of gangs.
   ``You've got to look for some quick-fix successes that you can
take into neighborhoods,'' said Natalie Salazar, executive director
of Los Angeles' Community Reclamation Project. ``You've got to get
rid of the graffiti, knock down some of the crack houses in the
area, make sure the street lights are fixed, make sure the streets
are swept.''
   CRP is a federally funded pilot program based in the harbor area
of Los Angeles, an area inhabited for generations by Hispanic and
Filipino gangs.
   Salazar said the year-old program works with schools in
anti-gang and anti-drug education and sponsors recreational
activities and citizens meetings with law enforcement agencies.
   Federal officials hope to expand the program, scheduled to end
in July, to other cities and states.
   Working on a small scale, sometimes just a two-block area, the
program teaches how to cope with such problems as graffiti and
loitering, Salazar said.
   To combat the factionalism inherent in gang culture, the program
sponsored a basketball tournament that involved 500 junior high
school-age youths.
   ``Kids from particular neighborhoods often feel they can't go
into other neighborhoods, or learn to hate people from other
neighborhoods,'' she said. ``The basketball tournament helps form
bonds with kids from other neighborhoods.''
   In the Los Angeles Police Department's Newton Division, which
has one of the highest homicide rates of any police precinct in the
nation, a citizens' group called 100 Men Plus has started a private
initiative against gangs, patrolling schools and parks, removing
graffiti and befriending neighborhood youth. The group recently
formed its fourth Los Angeles chapter.
   ``There's no way we can claim any kind of success because the
homicides are still there,'' said Valdivia, whose agency works with
100 Men Plus. ``But the signs are there.''

<HEAD>Two Schools Close Amid Racial Tension; Interim Superintendent
Resigns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city's first black school superintendent
was reinstated and five black school board members were urged to
return to their posts Tuesday after racial turmoil forced the
closing of two public schools.
   The all-white Selma Board of Education announced Norward
Roussell's reinstatement as superintendent and the closing of all
11 schools in the system Wednesday in a compromise aimed at ending
weeks of protests.
   The Rev. F.D. Reese, Selma High's black principal who was named
interim superintendent Sunday, announced he was resigning so
Roussell could resume his duties.
   Moments after Reese's announcement, black protest leaders met
with Mayor Joe Smitherman to discuss ways of ending weeks of racial
conflict over the operation of the predominantly black school
system. The 6,000-student city school system is about 70 percent
black.
   Smitherman and black leaders gave no details of the proposed
compromise, but both sides made clear that Roussell's return would
be a crucial element in any resolution of the conflict.
   The board announced later Tuesday that Roussell would resume his
duties and all 11 schools in the system would be closed Wednesday
``due to recent disturbances and turmoil which have prevented
normal operation of our school system.''
   ``Selma city schools will reopen upon adequate assurances to Dr.
Roussell and the board that the safety and physical welfare of our
students and all school employees can be ensured,'' the school
board said in a statement.
   The board has been made up of six whites since the five black
members announced they were resigning following a vote _ along
racial lines _ in December against extending Roussell's contract
beyond its June expiration date.
   The five later said they had not signed any official resignation
papers, leaving open their return.
   Mostly black Selma High School, with 1,508 students, and almost
all-black Eastside Middle School, with 407 students, closed Tuesday
as racial tensions rose following the arrest of four black leaders
in a melee at Smitherman's City Hall office the day before.
   Reese said there were instances of racial fighting at Selma High
School, and called for the orderly dismissal of students from the
city's only public high school because ``we could certainly see and
feel the level of tensions among the students.''
   Police were called to the school, but Smitherman said no arrests
were made.
   Dozens of the black students joined in a series of
demonstrations outside City Hall on Tuesday. With adults, they
carried signs saying ``Smitherman Must Go,'' sang songs of the
civil rights movement and called for Roussell's reinstatement.
   Roussell was at Selma High School as throngs of parents and
students left the building. He joined in helping disperse crowds of
students ``so we would not have any trouble.''
   Protesters have charged Roussell was dismissed because he is
black, an allegation denied by white school board members. They
cited an unfavorable job evaluation and Roussell's management style
as the reason for his firing.
   Last week, the remaining white board members decided to remove
Roussell from his $80,000-a-year job immediately, and on Sunday
installed Reese as interim superintendent.

<HEAD>Firefighters Race to Save Near-Extinct Marmoset from Blaze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters Tuesday raced to save
about 250 near-extinct golden lion marmosets from a forest fire
that has ravaged a wildlife reserve for rare animals in
southeastern Brazil, officials said.
   More than 200 firefighters, police and biologists were unable to
halt the fire, which started Saturday in the Poco das Antas
Wildlife Reserve 80 miles northeast of Rio, said reserve director
Dionizio Pessamilio.
   Pessamilio said the fire had burned about half the 12,300-acre
reserve, the last remaining natural habitat for the marmoset and a
sanctuary for rare sloths, alligators and jaguars.
   ``The situation is bad,'' he said in a televised interview.
``The dense forest where the tamarins live is now burning,
worsening their chances of survival.''
   Tamarin is another name for the marmoset, a monkey the size of a
cat with a lion-like mane and a bushy tail.
   Pessamilio said biologists had already lost contact with several
of the creatures, which are monitored by means of tiny radio
transmitters tied around their necks.
   Environmentalists are concerned the fire may kill all of the shy
animals because they hide in tree holes for warmth and shelter.
   High wind, difficult access to the mountainous area and a lack
of water caused by a long dry spell hampered firefighters' efforts,
Pessamilio said.
   Only several days of heavy rain would put out the fire, he said.
Rain was not forecast for the region until Friday.
   Globo TV, the nation's largest network, showed helicopters
airlifting firefighters to burning areas and crews battling flames
with portable water tanks and rubber mats.
   Fernando Mesquita, president of the Brazilian Institute of the
Environment and Renewable Resources, said more firefighters would
join the effort and work around-the-clock.
   The cause of the fire was not known. But officials said
unusually dry weather and 100-degree summer temperatures could have
caused the fire to begin spontaneously.
   Poco das Antas has become the center of an international crusade
to protect the environment.
   The reserve was founded in 1974 and funded by the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, the World Wildlife Fund and the
Brazilian and Canadian environmental groups.
   The marmoset first faced extinction in 1972 when just 70
remained on Earth after poachers, hunters and ranchers trapped them
and cut down their forest habitats.
   But the animal slowly had been reproducing after naturalists
released them in groups from foreign zoos into the Brazilian forest.

<HEAD>Northwest Gets Winter Weather; Rain Along the Gulf Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow and rain fell on sections of the Northwest on Tuesday, and
rain dampened the the Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi.
   The winter weather extended west of a cold front that reached
from central Idaho to the central coast of California. Winter storm
warnings were posted across the Washington Cascades and Olympic
Mountains and the northern coastal mountains of Oregon.
   In western Oregon, lightning strikes around Coos Bay knocked out
two radio transmitters, left a television station on reduced power
and caused local power outages, said Drew Walker, station manager
for KBBR radio in North Bend.
   More than a foot of snow had fallen by Tuesday in Stevens Pass
and Snoqualmie Pass in Washington state.
   More snow was expected in parts of Oregon, including the
Cascades. Snow was also expected over the western slopes of the
Sierra Nevada in California, south of Lake Tahoe.
   Rain extended from the northern coast of California to central
California, with rain changing to snow in the mountains and
extending across northern Utah, Idaho, northwest Wyoming and
western Montana.
   A winter storm watch was posted through Wednesday over western
Wyoming.
   A cold snap continued across inland Alaska, with low
temperatures ranging from minus 30 to minus 50. The cold spell
began Jan. 26, and temperatures have been 15 to 20 degrees lower
than normal for early February, although no records have been
broken.
   Scattered snow fell from northeast New York state to west
central New England.
   Rain showers streched from southern Mississippi to southern
Louisiana and the upper Texas Gulf Coast. Light rain extended from
eastern Kansas and southeast Nebraska, to northern and west central
Missouri.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 1 inch
at Astoria, Ore., and Quillayute, Wa. Heavier rainfall during the
same period included one third of an inch at New Orleans.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in Devils Lake,
N.D., where it was 44 degrees; Roanoke, Va., 64; and Williamsport,
Pa., 53.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was minus 8 degrees at Hibbing
and International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 78 degrees at Miami,
Key West and Fort Myers, Fla.

   Interim President Ion Iliescu
registered the former ruling National Salvation Front on Tuesday to
run in the May 20 elections, and a top aide said Iliescu will be
its presidential candidate.
   The Front, unelected and ruling by decree since longtime
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled and executed in
December, is considered the front-runner in the race against 29
political parties.
   ``Our candidate for president will be Mr. Iliescu, that's for
sure. That's what everyone wants,'' said Dan Radulescu, chief of
the Front's commission for press and public relations.
   Interim Prime Minister Petre Roman said in an interview for U.S.
television that he too wanted Iliescu, a former Communist official
who fell out with Ceausescu, to run for president.
   ``I hope it will be Iliescu,'' he said in the interview for John
McLaughlin's syndicated ``One on One'' program, which will be
broadcast in the United States next weekend. A transcript was made
available here.
   Roman said he would not campaign to be prime minister but would
probably accept the post if the Front wins the election and he is
asked by a majority of the movement.
   The Front on Jan. 23 reversed its pledge to stay out of the
election. It has refused to become a political party, choosing
instead to remain a political movement.
   Iliescu went to the central tribunal to officially register the
Front, which has split from the government and the eight-member
ruling council.
   The Front agreed to form a Council of National Unity with
opposition parties to run the country until Romania's first
multiparty elections since World War II are held in May. The new
National Unity Council will meet for the first time Friday.
   In its platform released Tuesday, the Front said its aim is
``realization in Romania of a democratic society based on political
pluralism, the separation of powers in the state, the assurance of
liberty and human dignity.''
   The Front said it also sought to guarantee ``the inviolability
of human rights, the respecting of the rights and liberties of all
national minorities, the guarantee of freedom of religion.''
   Another platform goal is ``creation of a modern national
economy'' based on efficiency and individual as well as collective
initiative.
   Roman said Romania was moving slowly toward a market economy and
faced two major economic problems: that it produced only basic
products and that its largest industries had far greater capacity
than the country needs.
   The platform included membership guidelines and an outline of
the party's structure from villages on up. It bars from membership
anyone convicted of crimes against the revolution.
   The platform made no mention of the Communist Party. Last month
the Front announced it would outlaw the party. Then it decided to
submit the question to a referendum, only to cancel the vote a
short time later.
   Asked in the interview whether the Communist Party was dead for
all practical purposes, Roman replied: ``The Communist Party
doesn't exist any more. Practically, it was a self-dissolution.''
   He said the Front and every political party had former
Communists as members.
   Sources in the Front, speaking on condition of anonymity,
meanwhile said Tourism Minister Mihai Lupoi had resigned. Radulescu
said he could not confirm the resignation.
   On Tuesday night, Roman acceded to cadet demands that Romania's
only merchant marine academy, the Mircea Cel Batrin Institute, be
demilitarized.
   He signed an agreement transferring authority over the institute
from the Defense Ministry to the Ministry of Education.
   Representatives of the 1,265 cadets expressed skepticism that
the Defense Ministry would cooperate. More than 200 cadets who
began a hunger strike Tuesday morning said they would continue
through the night.

   The three major Republican fund-raising
committees reaped more than $80 million in 1989 and entered this
election year with more than $14 million on hand, nearly triple the
combined war chest of their Democratic counterparts, the Federal
Election Commission said Tuesday.
   The Democratic National Committee and the party's separate House
and Senate campaign arms raised and spent more than $19 million in
1989 and carried over $5.4 million to this year.
   Last year was an unusually costly off year because of eight
special congressional elections. But while they spent considerable
amounts on those races, the national parties focused much of their
resources on building stronger fund-raising machinery for this year.
   The performance of the Democratic groups, while an improvement
over past non-federal election years, was again dwarfed by that of
the GOP's money machines. But tempering the Republican edge is the
fact that more Democrats, who hold a majority in both chambers of
Congress, enjoy the lopsided donor preference for giving to the
individual campaign coffers of incumbents. Thus Republicans, with
more challengers than incumbents, are more reliant on national
party support.
   The FEC data showed that the three Republican committees spent
$72.2 million of the $80.4 million they took in last year.
   But because of cash left over from 1988, the GOP groups entered
this year already armed with $14.4 million. The overwhelming bulk
of that money _ $10.6 million _ was in the coffers of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, which is hoping to erode the
Democratic majority in that chamber this year as part of a strategy
aimed at recapturing the Senate in the 1992 presidential elections.
   The GOP Senate committee, which raised $35.4 million and spent
$27 million, reported $589,734 in debts as of Jan. 31, about half
its $1.1 million debt at the end of 1987, the last comparable
non-election year.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP's main
fund-raising arm for House candidates, raised $14.2 million and
spent $13.1 million, according to its year-end filing with the FEC.
The NRCC had $2.3 million heading into this year and debts of
$794,654, up dramatically from the $34,922 in red ink it reported
two years ago.
   The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, reported receiving
$30.6 million in 1989 and spending $31 million. Because of its 1988
reserves, it carried over $1.5 million into this year while
reporting no debt, according to the FEC.
   On the Democratic side, the Democratic National Committee and
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee reported significant
strides last year in reducing debts. But the party's cash-poor
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee nearly doubled its debt
from two years ago and entered this year with just $22,179 on hand.
   The DCCC said it raised $4.1 million last year and spent $4.2
million. Its reported debts grew from $828,889 at the end of 1987
to $1.6 million as of Jan. 31. The $22,179 it had on hand entering
the year was less than one-tenth of the nearly $233,000 it held at
the beginning of 1988.
   Far more impressive was the fund-raising of the Democratic
Senate committee, which said it collected $8 million in
contributions and other receipts and spent $6 million. The
Democrats' Senate campaign operation had nearly $1.6 million in the
bank as the year began and had sliced the $1 million debt it
reported two years ago down to $319,201.
   The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, reported receipts
of $6.8 million and said it drew on 1988 reserves in spending $8.4
million last year. Those reserves, comparatively deep for the
Democratic Party, allowed it to enter the year with $3.8 million on
hand _ up dramatically from the $722,288 the party coffers held at
the end of 1987.
   The DNC also reported debts of $111,837 at the end of last year,
down from more than $1.6 million in red ink reported in its
year-end filing two years ago.
   ``We feel very good about it and look forward to a very good
1990,'' DNC Treasurer Robert Farmer said, adding the DNC hoped to
raise at least $10 million. He said national party groups will face
competition for money because of 36 gubernatorial elections and
other state races vital to the outcome of congressional
redistricting.
   For all of the committees, the totals raised include
contributions and other receipts such as interest on bank accounts
and certificates of deposit.
   Separate FEC data on the special elections last year show that
nearly $11 million was spent on the eight races. There were 41
initial candidates in the eight elections, with the 16 who survived
to participate in the final, head-to-head contests accounting for
$8.9 million of the spending total.
   The national parties and their state affiliates invested heavily
in those races, with total expenditures by the major parties
reaching neatly $1.2 million.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun's soldiers drove rival
militiamen from a northern suburb Tuesday and turned their guns on
a surrounded garrison in an intra-Christian war that has cost
hundreds of lives in eight days.
   Beirut's largest Christian hospital said its morgue had
overflowed and the bodies would have to be buried in a mass grave.
   Voice of Lebanon, a Christian radio station, said said thousands
of people were going hungry in bomb shelters made cold and dank
because of heavy rain and a power failure caused when shellfire
knocked out the main power station.
   Police said 38 people were killed and 111 wounded Tuesday. That
raised casualties to 315 killed and 1,148 wounded since the battle
for Christian supremacy began Jan. 30 between Aoun's men and the
Lebanese Forces militia led by Samir Geagea.
   President Elias Hrawi appealed to the superpowers, Vatican,
European governments, the United Nations and Arab leaders for help
in ending the fighting.
   ``I appeal for your support in any effort or endeavor I might
find myself compelled to take ... to end the plight of the Lebanese
people and salvage Lebanon,'' he said in telegrams to President
Bush, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Pope John Paul II and other leaders.
   Arab leaders receiving the telegram included President Hafez
Assad of Syria, who keeps 40,000 soldiers and 300 tanks in Lebanon
and supports Hrawi, whom Parliament elected in November as part of
a peace plan designed to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun's television station reported that Papal Nuncio Pablo
Puentes delivered a message from the pope to Aoun but gave no
details except to say that it concerned the fighting in the
Christian enclave.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as military chief, but the general, who
rejects the peace plan and does not recognize the president, has
refused to relinquish his command.
   On Tuesday, Hrawi called Aoun ``a mutineer against legitimacy''
and blamed him for the latest carnage.
   His statement was seen as a threat to intervene militarily. He
would have to call on the Syrians for that because the 22,000
Moslem troops loyal to him are poorly trained and equipped.
   Syrian troops fought a six-month war last year with Aoun, who
calls them an ``army of occupation.'' It ended when the Arab League
arranged a cease-fire in September.
   During a visit to Syria by Hrawi last month, Assad publicly
pledged to help him crush the general.
   After the Lebanese Forces abandoned the strategic suburb of
Dbaye on Tuesday, Aoun's gunners trained their artillery on a
surrounded militia garrison in Christian east Beirut. The militia,
which said Dbaye was destroyed by ``hysterical shelling,''
responded by shelling areas controlled by Aoun.
   The Hotel Dieu hospital in the Ashrafiyeh district of east
Beirut said its morgue was full and the bodies were decomposing
because of the power failure.
   ``We find ourselves obliged to bury the victims in a mass grave
in Ashrafiyeh Wednesday if no one shows up to collect them,'' it
said in a statement broadcast by Voice of Lebanon.
   A Moslem station, Voice of the Nation, said: ``Those who would
emerge from shelters to collect the bodies would end up dead.''
   French official Bernard Kouchner met with Hrawi and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss about helping residents of the 310-mile enclave
north and east of Beirut where 1 million Christians live.
   Kouchner organized an evacuation of wounded Lebanese civilians
to a French hospital ship in April 1989. He said a French plane
with ``about 150 seats for sitting wounded'' landed early in the
day at Beirut Airport, in the Moslem western sector.
   A spokesman for the Health Ministry, which is helping coordinate
Kouchner's mission, said word had been sent ``to the warring
factions, but no practical responses have been received to help get
the mercy mission going.''
   Lebanon became a French mandate after World War I and gained
independence in 1943.
   Aoun's command said it had ``crushed the last pockets of
resistance'' in Dbaye and cut off militiamen north of the suburb
from besieged Lebanese Forces strongholds in east Beirut. Aoun
commands nearly 20,000 men and Geagea has 6,000 militia regulars,
with an estimated 30,000 reservists.
   The Lebanese Forces said its men redeployed along the northern
entrance of the 300-yard Dog River tunnel north of Dbaye. Police
reported that Aoun's tanks chased the militiamen to the edge of the
Dog River valley.
   Other tank units hammered the militia's besieged Kassardjian
garrison in the east Beirut district of Ein Rummaneh all day
Tuesday in apparent preparation to storm it, police reported.
   According to Aoun's command, ``all escape routes'' from
Kassardjian were sealed. The garrison backs up on the hostile
Shiite Moslem district of Shiyah across the capital's sectarian
dividing line.
   Gunners loyal to the general pounded the militia-controlled
residential districts of Ashrafiyeh, Jemmayezeh and Karantina with
U.S.-made 155mm howitzers.
   Police said militia gunners replied with Soviet-designed 122mm
rockets fired at the Sin el-Fil, Furn el-Shubbak, Hazmiyeh and
Fayadiyeh districts held by Aoun, and at the Baabda suburb, where
he has a headquarters bunker beneath Lebanon's shattered
presidential palace.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that
Mississippi's public universities are insufficiently desegregated,
overruling a lower court judge.
   In its 2-1 decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
that, with few exceptions, the state's five historically white and
three historically black universities remain virtually as
segregated as they were when black citizens sued the state in
January 1975.
   In their majority opinion, Judges Irving Goldberg and Sam D.
Johnson said ``there were many steps, but no discernible degrees of
progress ... Unfortunately, this case lingered, loitered and lulled
for more than a decade.''
   The court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Neal B.
Biggers Jr., who had dismissed the lawsuit after declaring
Mississippi's university system sufficiently desegregated.
   Most state and university officials could not be reached
immediately for comment, and those who could were guarded in their
comments.
   ``I have learned about this decision secondhand. I have not seen
any legal documents. I'm quite sure our attorneys will be briefing
us soon,'' said Aubrey Lucas, president of the University of
Southern Mississippi.
   The appellate court ordered further proceedings involving a
broader cast of characters.
   ``Psychologists, sociologists, economists, engineers, doctors
and professionals from all relevant areas of learning play a
role,'' said the majority opinion.
   ``Windows must open to ventilate the courtroom with ideas from
the winds of truth,'' it said. ``To this end, testimony,
depositions, cross-examinations and opinions can assist. Only then
should the parties come forth with a definite plan for'' achieving
desegregation.
   In a dissent, Judge John Duhe said Mississippi had fulfilled its
legal obligation to open its universities to all students,
regardless of race.
   ``The majority, relying on district and other circuit court
decisions, has ... imposed upon the state the same constitutional
duty required for primary and secondary education, where freedom of
choice is unavailable and services are free of charge.
   ``In doing so,'' wrote Duhe, ``it takes a liberty that is simply
not available to courts of appeals.''
   In its review, the 5th Circuit said racial imbalances of
students, faculty, undergraduate and graduate programs,
appropriations, and admissions policies, among other things, have
continued since the court ordered the University of Mississippi to
enroll James Meredith, its first black student, in 1962.
   To this day, the majority said, historically white Delta State
University, Mississippi State University, Mississippi University
for Women, the University of Mississippi and the University of
Southern Mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over historically
black Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State
universities.
   Standardized college admissions examinations, as administered by
Mississippi, also discriminate, the court said, and the Board of
Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning spent more money
on educating students at mostly white institutions than they did on
students at black schools.
   For instance, the court said, the state spent an average $1,351
in 1960 and $8,516 in 1986 on each student enrolled at historically
white institutions. The average at historically black schools was
$718 in 1960 and $6,038 in 1986, the court said.
   ``The badge of inferiority that marks black institutions has not
been removed,'' Goldberg and Johnson wrote. ``As such, there
remains in Mississippi's higher educational system vestiges of
discrimination which distort the perceptions of black students.
   ``Vestiges of de jure segregation permeate the public university
system of Mississippi. Admissions policies, the racial composition
of the faculty and administration, funding practices, academic
offerings and mission designations all perpetuate a stigma of
inferiority.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with jury ending deliberations
for the day, rehearing tapes; picks up 7th graf, `Assistant

   Jurors in the assault and conspiracy trial of
reputed mob boss John Gotti concluded their first day of
deliberations Tuesday after listening again to 11 tapes that are
the prosecution's key evidence.
   The jury retired at about 7:15 p.m., and was to resume
deliberations Wednesday morning.
   Law enforcement officers secretly recorded a dozen tapes of
conversations at Gotti's hangout in the borough of Queens and in
the visiting room of a jail.
   Among the conversations jurors heard again were one in which
Gotti allegedly says, ``We're gonna, gonna bust him up,'' which the
prosecution says is a reference to a former union leader, and
another in which members of the Westies gang allegedly say they
shot the man as a favor to Gotti.
   The defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible, and claims
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory that Gotti had
John F. O'Connor shot.
   As the jury began deliberations earlier in the day, Acting
Justice Edward McLaughlin told the four alternate jurors they would
be held in court custody and he could not tell them why.
   A court source said the alternates were being held ``at least
until tomorrow, and maybe longer'' to minimize chances of their
being found and bothered for information about the 12 main jurors.
   Since their swearing-in about three weeks ago, all the jurors
have been sequestered to shield them from publicity and possible
jury-tampering. Court officials estimate it costs $1,200 a day to
feed, house and transport them.
   About two hours after getting the case, the jurors sent a note
requesting a rereading of the definition of first-degree
intentional assault, the first count on their verdict sheet. They
then began rehearing the tapes.
   Gotti, 49, and his co-defendant, Anthony ``Tony Lee'' Guerrieri,
61, are accused of commissioning the Westies, a gang from
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen district, to shoot O'Connor, former vice
president of Carpenters Union Local 608, on May 7, 1986. O'Connor
was shot in the buttocks and survived.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky said Gotti,
alleged boss of the Gambino crime family, arranged the shooting
because O'Connor ordered goons to trash Bankers and Brokers, a
mob-run restaurant in Lower Manhattan that was being built with
non-union labor.
   The judge told the jurors that, to convict, they must find the
prosecution proved the specific elements of the crime charged in
the trial and not simply that Gotti and his co-defendant might be
members of organized crime.
   He also reminded them that the prosecution's key witness, former
Westies member and confessed killer James McElroy, 45, testified he
had previously lied under oath. The judge told the jurors it was up
to them to decide whether they believe McElroy was testifying
truthfully against Gotti.
   Just before the jurors left to deliberate, McLaughlin admonished
them:
   ``The person that you were when you left your apartment those
weeks ago is the person you're supposed to be in the jury room,''
he said. ``Do not become somebody else. Don't turn the jury room
into the Twilight Zone. Don't expect divine intervention.''
   ``You do not have to answer to anybody but yourselves regarding
the verdict,'' McLaughlin said. ``If you can look at yourself in
the mirror every day for the rest of your life and say, `I
conscientiously followed the law and called it as I saw it,' then
whatever your verdict turns out to be, it will have been the
correct one.''
   In closing arguments Monday, defense lawyers Bruce Cutler and
Gerald Shargel said Gotti was being persecuted because of his
reputation.
   ``When the smoke clears, you will realize one thing _ that there
is no proof, let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that John
Gotti and Anthony Guerrieri had John O'Connor shot,'' Shargel said.
   The judge told the jurors the charges they are to consider _
intentional first- and second-degree assault; reckless first- and
second-degree assault; fourth-degree conspiracy, a felony, and
fifth-degree conspiracy, a misdemeanor.
   If convicted, Gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974.

   A Food and Drug Administration survey that
found the nation's milk supply to be free of veterinary drug
residues was attacked Tuesday in a congressional hearing.
   The challenges to the FDA survey of milk in 14 cities came from
Rep. Ted Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on government and human resources, and FDA scientist
Joseph Settepani.
   ``Too many government officials seem to think their overriding
responsibility is to reassure the public that the milk supply is
safe, even when it may not be,'' said Weiss, D-N.Y., alleging that
FDA is more concerned with public relations than science.
   The FDA released a study Monday that contradicted findings of
two surveys by The Wall Street Journal and an advocacy group, the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, as well as findings of
its own.
   Both private tests were done using a relatively new test known
as the Charm 2. The test is highly sensitive, able to test drug
residues in amounts as low as five parts per billion, its advocates
say.
   But the FDA said the test yields too many false positives and
none of its positive findings could be validated in what it
considered to be better, even newer tests. The Charm 2 test is
limited also because it detects only classes of drugs, not
individual drugs within a class, FDA says.
   The FDA said that using Charm 2, it found a variety of drugs in
36 out of 70 samples. Of those, 14 contained sulfa drugs.
   Those 14 were tested by high pressure liquid chromatography,
which found sulfa drugs in 11 samples. That test was sensitive to
at least 10 parts per billion.
   The test has been accepted by federal regulators for detecting
only a single drug, sulfamethazine, and not for the purpose it was
used in the newest test, according to FDA testimony.
   The 11 samples were further tested by mass spectrometry, and
none was found to be positive for individual sulfa drugs. The test
is capable of isolating specific drugs, but it is less sensitive
than Charm 2, able only to detect amounts of 20 parts per billion.
Six of 11 samples were below 20 parts per billion by the other
tests.
   ``There is just no way to believe that mass spectrometry, which
is sensitive to only about 20 parts per billion, could have picked
those up even by your expectations,'' Weiss said.
   Settepani, who testified with the FDA panel and earlier with a
member of the consumer group, complained that FDA had earlier tried
to discredit tests that find potentially dangerous residues in milk.
   ``The initial reaction to each new report of residues in milk
has been attempts to discredit the assay used to obtain the
reported results,'' he said.
   He said a 1988 internal memorandum listed 30 drugs believed to
be used by milk producers, 16 of them extensively. But current
standard tests used by state inspectors can only detect two, he
said.

<HEAD>Appeals Judge Questions Why Reagan Didn't Testify for North</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS grafs 7-10: ``Silberman also,'' on argument over
North's immunized testimony</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals judge hearing Oliver North's
Iran-Contra case Tuesday questioned why North wasn't allowed to
call former President Reagan as a defense witness at his trial.
   During nearly 2{ hours of arguments, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge
Laurence Silberman noted that Reagan's written answers to questions
in the Iran-Contra affair were submitted to a grand jury, but were
never provided to North's lawyers.
   Silberman, one of three judges who will rule on North's appeal
of his conviction on three felony counts, asked why, ``as a matter
of basic fairness'' Reagan's written answers weren't turned over to
the defendant.
   Government attorney Gerard Lynch said the judgment was made that
Reagan's written answers would not have been ``helpful'' to North
and so weren't turned over.
   ``But our system ... is based on'' giving someone accused of a
crime wide latitude in obtaining information for his defense,
responded Silberman.
   The appeals court panel consists of Silberman and David
Sentelle, both Reagan administration appointees, and Carter
administration appointee Patricia Wald, chief judge of the appeals
court.
   Silberman also questioned whether the case against North was
tainted by his own immunized testimony to Congress in 1987, another
basis on which North is urging that his convictions be reversed.
   Senior Reagan administration officials testified at North's
trial ``after being drenched in the immunized testimony'' he gave
on national television, said Silberman. ''You have a prima facie
violation'' of the requirement that no part of a case be derived
from a defendant's immunized testimony.
   But Lynch said North's lawyers are incorrectly equating
``exposure with taint and use'' and that the prosecution was based
on independent recollection of all witnesses.
   Indicating that Reagan's written answers in the Iran-Contra
inquiry may have been more general than specific, Silberman said
that ``what troubles me is we don't have a very good idea'' of what
Reagan might have said as a defense witness for North.
   If North had worked in the State Department and Reagan had been
secretary of state, there would have been no question that he would
have been called to testify, said Silberman.
   North, who was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity, argued that all his
activities were approved by his superiors, national security
adviser John Poindexter and Reagan.
   Silberman also questioned whether Poindexter's videotaped
testimony on Capitol Hill should have been admitted as evidence at
the North trial.
   ``Only two people were north of North ... the president and
Admiral Poindexter,'' said Silberman.
   Lynch emphasized that ``North's own testimony'' was that he
never met alone with Reagan, and that North ``never said the
president told him to do anything.''
   Silberman said that even if Reagan didn't specifically authorize
the actions for which North was convicted of crimes, the
ex-president's testimony might have been helpful to North.
   ``Suppose the ex-president says that `I never gave specific
authorization' (but) `I did indicate that I didn't wish this
information to be revealed,'' said Silberman.
   Defense attorney Barry Simon said Reagan should have been called
to confirm that he authorized keeping secret from Congress the U.S.
connection to a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel
to Iran.
   Lynch conceded that North may have gotten the ``impression''
from Poindexter that the U.S. role was to be kept secret. But Lynch
argued that North knew he was committing a wrongful act when he
obstructed Congress from learning of the issue.
   ``We're not talking about keeping secrets from enemies of the
United States'' or ``even the public,'' said Lynch.
   At North's trial, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell
quashed a subpoena for Reagan's appearance. The judge ruled there
was no evidence in the record to suggest that the former president
authorized any illegal activities by North.
   Gesell also rejected a request to admit as evidence portions of
Poindexter's congressional testimony on videotaped segments which
were prepared by North's trial team.
   Gesell on July 5 placed North on probation for two years, fined
him $150,000 and sentenced him to 1,200 hours of community service.
North is performing the community service while appealing the
convictions and fine.

<HEAD>Senate Thwarts Attempt To Scrap Teacher Certification Board</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4th graf: ``The National,'' and edits throughout to

<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Tuesday defeated an attempt to
strip federal funds from a national school teacher certification
board, setting the stage for passage of a nearly $1.5 billion
educational improvement bill.
   By a 64-35 vote, lawmakers turned back an attempt by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and others to strike from the Excellence in
Education Act a provision giving federal money to the panel.
Critics argued that it would give the federal government too great
a say in setting teacher standards.
   Supporters of the provision, tacked onto sweeping education
legislation President Bush sent to Capitol Hill in April 1989, said
a well-financed board would give badly needed prestige to the
teaching profession. It would bestow the kind of credential review
that doctors, lawyers and others now get, they said.
   The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was
created in 1987 at the urging of the National Governors'
Association. It is an independent, nonpartisan organization
governed by a 64-member board of directors, including
representatives of teachers' unions. Activities so far have been
low-key.
   The Senate is considering a wide-ranging education bill which,
among other things, seeks to combat drugs in public schools,
establish a presidential merit schools program and increase aid to
schools seeking to lower dropout rates. The Senate planned a vote
Wednesday on the overall bill.
   According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the bill
cost nearly $1.5 billion over the next five years.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate passed 99-0 legislation that would
provide $50 million in the next fiscal year to attack illiteracy _
said to affect at least 23 million Americans _ with a goal of
eliminating illiteracy by the year 2000.
   Helms argued that activities of the teaching standards board
would be dominated by these unions _ the National Education
Association and the American Federation of Teachers.
   ``What this board wants is for it to be the sole voice of
setting the standards by which teachers operate _ that only
teachers and their unions should decide who can and who cannot
teach,'' Helms argued. ``Now, I think that's an outrage.''
   ``The control of these unions over the board will enable them to
use taxpayers' money not so much to professionalize teachers as to
finalize who does and does not teach in America'' he said.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a vote against the bill was ``a
vote for parents.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., charged that ``misinformation''
was being spread about the board. He and other supporters noted
that none of the $25 million could be used to pay the board's
operating expenses _ that the panel would have to raise those funds
through private means.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said, ``This board represents a unique
opportunity to improve education.
   ``I think one thing everyone can agree on is that our
educational system has serious deficiencies,'' he said, ``and it is
adversely affecting our competitive position in the world.''
   Bush had proposed a $25 million authorization for federal grants
to states to improve teacher certification. That was changed in the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The money would be used
instead by the national board for research and development of a
national certification program, under which teachers could
voluntarily seek review of their qualifications.

   The driver of the tour bus that was attacked
by masked gunmen, leaving nine Israeli tourists dead, has been
detained on suspicion he collaborated in the assault, newspapers
reported Wednesday.
   Al-Ahram newspaper said police evidence indicated the attack
Sunday was planned abroad and carried out by three gunmen in
addition to the bus driver. Earlier reports spoke of two gunmen.
   Al-Ahram quoted police sources as saying the guns, grenades and
ammunition used in the attack were smuggled into Egypt from another
country.
   The nine were killed when the assailants opened fire with
machine guns and tossed hand grenades on a desert road between
Cairo and the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya. Twenty people were
injured, including an Egyptian tour guide.
   The incident has shocked Israelis and provoked right-wing calls
to exclude Egypt from the peace process. It remains unclear who
carried out the attack. Three Arab groups have claimed
responsibility.
   Al-Ahram reported that bus driver Saeed Abdel-Raouf, a
Palestinian, was detained after witnesses said he stopped the bus
immediately after the attackers signaled him to do so.
   Abdel-Raouf, who was said to have gained Egyptian nationality
some time ago, said in an interview televised Monday night that he
was taken by surprise and that he stopped the bus after he heard a
``bang'' that he thought came from a tire explosion.
   Reports by other government newspapers said the man who rented
the attack car is a 34-year-old Palestinian with a Jordanian
passport named Akram Deeb Ihab.
   Ihab came to Egypt Jan. 21 and left the country a week later,
the daily Al-Akhbar reported.
   Al-Ahram said about 60 suspects, mostly Palestinians, and an
unspecified number of Egyptian non-commissioned police officers on
board the tour bus were detained for questioning.
   Police sources who demanded anonymity said those detained
included a Palestinian believed connected with the ambush but not
as a gunman.
   The non-commissioned officers boarded the bus from Rafeh, a
divided city on the border with Israel in the Sinai Peninsula and
left the bus when ordered to do so by the attackers, Al-Ahram said.
   A senior police official, Maj. Gen. Bahaa el-Din Ibrahim, denied
a report Monday by the state-run Middle East News Agency Tuesday
that one gunman had been arrested.
   A spokesman at the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for
internal security, refused to discuss the newspaper reports.
   Newspapers reported Tuesday that police had found the passport
of a Palestinian they believe was involved in an attack, and that
authorities were searching for two Palestinians with Jordanian
passports. Al-Ahram said police suspect the passports are forged.
   Newspapers identified the Palestinian whose passport was found
as Akram Shihab, 25. They said he and another man arrived in Egypt
on Jan. 21 and rented a furnished apartment at Shibin el-Kanatir, a
Nile River delta town just north of Cairo.
   A senior Jordanian official in Amman said Shihab, the user of
the seized passport, ``is not a Jordanian'' but was from Rafah
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip since the 1967 Middle East
war. Many Gaza Palestinians carry Jordanian passports but Jordan
does not consider them citizens.
   Al-Akhbar carried a statement attributed to Ahmed Jebril's
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian-General Command
claiming responsibility for the attack.
   It said the claim was broadcast Tuesday over Libya's Tripoli
radio but monitors in London said they heard no such statement. The
official Libyan news agency did not carry the claim.
   Two Arab groups have claimed responsibility for the bus attack.
One, in Cairo Sunday night, was made by an anonymous caller to a
Western news agency who said he spoke for the previously unknown
Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed in Egyptian Prisons.
   In Jordan, a handwritten message sent Monday to the French news
agency Agence France-Presse claimed the assault for an obscure
group calling itself Islamic Jihad-Beit Al-Maqdis, Arabic for holy
war-Jerusalem.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Scraps English-Only Law in Arizona</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday threw out Arizona's
voter-approved measure making English the state's official
language, saying it violated the U.S. Constitution's First
Amendment.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt said in a 20-page decision
that the measure was ``substantially overbroad.''
   Rosenblatt ruled on a lawsuit by Maria-Kelly Yniguez, a state
Department of Administration worker, and state Sen. Jaime Gutierrez.
   Ms. Yniguez, who evaluates and arbitrates medical malpractice
claims, said the law inhibited her constitutional right to free
speech and threatened her job if she used Spanish while speaking
with a co-worker.
   Gutierrez, a Tucson Democrat who represents a partially Hispanic
district, said the law could block him from communicating
effectively with constituents.
   Rosenblatt dismissed Gutierrez from the case but said Yniguez
was justified in her concerns.
   The Arizona initiative, approved by a 580,830-to-569,993 vote in
the state's 1988 general election, changed Arizona's constitution
to designate English as the state's official language and impose
sharp limits on use of other languages in state or local government
affairs.
   ``I thought it was a longshot,'' Gutierrez said of the ruling.
``It took a lot of courage on the part of the judge. I hope the
decision can be used nationwide, but we'll just fight the battles
one at a time.''
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, the only person with legal
standing to appeal the decision, said she was happy the courts
ruled it unconstitutional and considered the law flawed.
   Mofford's press secretary, Vada Manager, said the governor would
not appeal the ruling.
   But the measure's backers said Mrs. Mofford should appeal the
decision, especially because a state court had upheld the measure's
constitutionality last year and since similar laws in 16 other
states had been allowed to stand.
   ``It's a surprise and a disappointment,'' said Bob Park, head of
Arizonans for Official English. ``Federal courts have upheld
(English language amendments) wherever they have been challenged. I
am quite confident we would win an appeal.''

   Pvt. Arnold Kephart returned to Omaha and was
welcomed by his family Tuesday after the Army said it wouldn't
court-martial him for desertion for fleeing to East Germany after
crashing a truck 30 years ago.
   Kephart's request for a less-than-honorable discharge was
granted Tuesday, allowing him to fly to Omaha for the second time
in a week to be given a tumultuous welcome from about 40 relatives,
friends and well-wishers.
   He was arrested at Omaha's Eppley Airfield when he arrived from
Europe last week to see his family for the first time since 1960.
   When he stepped off the plane from Dallas on Tuesday, Kephart
spotted his 12-year-old son. ``Frankie,'' he exclaimed, and
embraced the boy born in East Germany and left with his father's
relatives for the past week.
   Others at the airport included Kephart's 86-year-old father,
Ernest Kephart of Council Bluffs, Iowa, two sisters and two
brothers.
   When he hugged his father and sister, Flossie Dunbar of Council
Bluffs, Kephart sobbed: ``This time nothing's going to stop us.''
   At the airport arrival gate, relatives had unfurled a 20-foot
red-and-white banner that read, ``Welcome Back, Arnold and
Frankie!''
   ``It's just wonderful,'' Ernest Kephart said through tears as he
hugged his son. ``I can't believe it.''
   About 30 family members were waiting Jan. 30 at Eppley Airfield,
but only his father and a sister were allowed to speak to Kephart
before he was taken away.
   ``I'm going to live it up,'' the 53-year-old Kephart told
reporters outside the Army's Fort Sill in Oklahoma earlier Tuesday
after he was given his discharge. ``I'm going to live it up first
... and then I'm going to sit down and try to work my way in life
as I did before.''
   ``I don't know how I'm going to say it, but I'll say I'm proud
to be back in the United States,'' Kephart said, who said he
deserted for fear a truck accident would land him in the stockade.
   His attorney, James Martin Davis, said Kephart tried to escape
the Communist bloc country on several occasions. When East Germany
opened its borders late last year, Kephart decided to return to the
United States with Frankie.
   ``This time, the Army did it right,'' Davis said, saying he
hopes to get a thorough medical exam for Kephart, whose poor diet
in East Germany may have harmed his health.
   Kephart, originally from Langdon, Mo., said he probably would
spend five or six weeks with relatives in Council Bluffs, Iowa,
across the Missouri River from Omaha.
   His ex-wife, Brigitte, and his twin 8-year-old daughters,
Kathleen and Katharina, remain in East Germany. He said he would
like to have them come to the United States.
   Kephart was declared absent without leave in November 1960 while
a private stationed in Heidelberg, West Germany. He was driving
back to his base from France when the truck crashed. There were
three corked bottles of French wine in the truck, he said.
   ``In the crash, the wine got broke up on our uniforms. The
police, they thought that we had been drunk. ... We didn't have one
single drink from the wine,'' Kephart told the Omaha World-Herald
on Monday.
   Kephart said French police locked them up, and the soldier's
superiors took them into custody. He said his superiors told him he
would be sent to prison and would have to pay for the truck.
   He said he waited for his chance, then scaled the barbed wire.
   ``I didn't decide on East Germany. I had a girlfriend back then
... she said I'd be safe over there,'' Kephart said.
   Kephart's discharge will be finalized when he receives the
discharge papers from the Army, which his lawyer said should be by
week's end.
   Fort Sill spokeswoman Sheila Samples said the
other-than-honorable discharge means Kephart is eligible for few
benefits.

in Prague</NOTE>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, trying to guide the drive to German reunification, registered
his support Tuesday for a plan that would keep the country in NATO
but bar Western troops from moving into what is now East Germany.
   The proposal, advanced by West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher last week, also would allow Soviet troops to
remain in the eastern region _ at least at the outset.
   A senior U.S. official familiar with Baker's thinking said the
move to reunification had accelerated to the point that the two
Germanies are likely to begin a process of economic, political and
legal integration after East Germany holds national elections March
18.
   ``The process of unification is taking place on the ground right
now, and will continue to take place at a quick pace,'' said the
senior official, traveling aboard Baker's plane and commenting only
on condition he not be named.
   Later, in a speech scheduled for delivery Wednesday at Charles
University, Baker proposed that the United States, Canada, the
Soviet Union and 32 European nations send observer delegations to
eastern and central Europe to ensure that the emerging democracies
hold elections that genuinely represent their people.
   In his text, Baker also voiced support for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for a summit of the 35 nations later in
the year, and proposed it establish free elections as a human right.
   He said the Soviet leadership apparently had agreed that
``legitimacy, not force, is the only way to ensure European
stability.''
   Baker has publicly lent support to the general idea of German
reunification without committing himself to any specific approach.
He has stressed only that the country be in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and that it evolve in a peaceful, step-by-step
way.
   His support for the Genscher plan, therefore, could be
significant. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, with
whom Baker will open four days of talks in Moscow on Wednesday
night, has called for an international referendum, while expressing
concern over ``the revival of sinister shadows of the past.''
   Baker's visit to Prague coincided with a visit by East German
premier Hans Modrow for talks with Czech premier Marian Calfa.
There has been speculation, but no confirmation, that Baker and
Modrow might meet.
   Modrow told reporters in a no-questions briefing that he ahd
Calfa agreed that German reunification ``should only be completed
in a process which respects and preserves the interests of
neighbors and European states.''
   Baker discussed the situation with French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas during a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, and then
flew here for talks with leaders of Czechoslovakia's ``Velvet
Revolution.''
   Baker met with Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who was
elevated to the presidency with the disintegration of the Communist
Party in December, and separately with Roman Catholic Cardinal
Frantisek Tomasek and leaders of the Civic Forum, the pro-democracy
group that toppled the hardliners.
   Baker told reporters that he had ``a very productive
discussion'' with Havel about troop and weapon reductions in Europe
and that it would be resumed when Havel visits Washington in two
weeks.
   He announced a series of moves by the Bush administration to
assist Czechoslovakia's economy, including the dismantling of U.S.
trade barriers _ provided laws are enacted permitting free
elections _ and support for Czechoslovakia's entry into the
International Monetary Fund the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
   But he cautioned the Prague government that ``it is up to you to
provide a conducive legal environment, to turn over or sell
factories to private owners, and to lift the heavy hand of
excessive government intervention.''
   He brought an offer of technical advice to assist the country's
adoption of a free market system and other capitalistic wrappings
that are enticing American businesses. But he brought no aid.
   ``They do not want a handout,'' said a U.S. official who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Here, as elsewhere in Europe, attention is riveted on Germany
and the future of American and Soviet troops.
   Havel has demanded the withdrawal of the estimated 75,000 Soviet
soldiers in Czechoslovakia. His plans for disarmament could be an
impetus for further U.S. cuts, beyond the 100,000 or so that would
be withdrawn under President Bush's latest proposal.
   But a U.S. official said, ``There are many statements by Havel
and others in Czechoslovakia who recognize an important U.S. role
in political, economic and security terms.''
   Baker and Dumas, in their 90-minute meeting in Ireland, ``both
recognized that unification is moving ahead very quickly,'' the
senior U.S. official said. ``They thought that all things
considered that it's actually moving along in a pretty effective
fashion.''
   While the French foreign minister did not specifically endorse
the Genscher plan, the official said, ``from the tone of it, it was
very positive.'' Moreover, the official said, the 16-member NATO
alliance is moving toward a consensus in support of the plan.
   Genscher discussed it with Baker at the State Department last
Friday night, and it is bound to be a major item in the agenda for
Baker's talks with Shevardnadze and with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   ``Genscher has come up with one proposal, and we think that the
proposal in terms of not having NATO forces move further east is a
pretty good one,'' the official said.
   Also, he stressed, it would keep the new and larger Germany in
NATO, a move that is designed to reassure other European countries
who have suffered in two devastating wars this century.

<HEAD>Actor John Merivale, Companion of Vivien Leigh, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Merivale, who played English gentlemen with
stiff upper lips in such movies as ``A Night to Remember,'' ``King
Rat'' and ``Arabesque'' in the 1950s and '60s, died Tuesday, his
family said. He was 72.
   Merivale, who appeared on stage, film and television, died in
his sleep in London's Charing Cross Hospital, his family said.
Cause of death was pneumonia following a long illness resulting
from renal failure, a hereditary illness that killed his actor
father.
   Although not a leading man, Merivale was a dependable support
player and an integral part of the entertainment world throughout
his working life.
   Handsome, tall, courteous and charming, he was born into a
theatrical family in Toronto. His father was actor Philip Merivale.
His mother was actress Viva Birkett. His father later married
actress Gladys Cooper.
   Merivale was educated at Rugby, a prestigious private school,
and Oxford University. But his Oxford stay was cut short, partly
because of his father's financial problems after an investment in a
disastrous Shakespearean production.
   Merivale entered movies in 1933; his first role was a newspaper
vendor.
   In 1938, he appeared on stage in London and met actress Vivien
Leigh, future wife of actor Laurence Olivier. In 1940, Merivale
appeared in a short-run New York production of Shakespeare's
``Romeo and Juliet'' produced and financed by her and Olivier.
   During World War II, Merivale served as a pilot in Britain's
Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force.
   Merivale made much of his early acting career in the United
States. He appeared in Cecil Beaton's New York production of Oscar
Wilde's ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' in 1946 and in Rex Harrison's New
York production of ``Anne of a Thousand Days'' in 1948.
   He married actress Jan Sterling in 1941. Following their divorce
in 1948, he returned to England, appearing in London stage comedies
like ``The Reluctant Debutante'' while making a name for himself in
movies.
   One of his best remembered movie roles was in ``A Night to
Remember'' (1958), about the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. He
played a husband who sees his family safely into the crowded
lifeboats, then goes down with the liner.
   During the 1950s, while continuing with his stage and movie
work, Merivale made a successful career in television, appearing in
``The Third Man'' series, ``The Gentle Goddess,'' ``The Verdict is
Yours'' and other shows.
   Merivale and Vivien Leigh began a discreet affair following her
separation from Olivier. She and Olivier were divorced in 1961 and
she and Merivale lived together until her death in 1967.
   Miss Leigh and Merivale acted together in London and on a world
tour in 1958 in the play ``Duel of Angels.'' They also appeared in
John Gielgud's Broadway staging of ``Ivanov'' in 1965.
   In 1986, Merivale married his second wife, actress Dinah
Sheridan, who survives him, together with stepchildren from his
marriages.

<HEAD>Brother Of New Haven Mayor Charged With Running Drug Factory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A brother of this city's new mayor on
Tuesday turned himself in to another brother who is a police
detective on charges of operating a drug factory and other
narcotics violations, officials said.
   Robert Daniels, 48, surrendered to his brother, Melvin, said
Khalid Lum, Mayor John Daniels' spokesman.
   Lum said the mayor knew his brother had a drug problem and has
tried to help him at various times, but said Robert Daniels
apparently had even more problems than the family realized.
   The mayor was very saddened by the arrest, Lum said. ``He loves
his brother very much.''
   The mayor had been aware a warrant had been issued for his
brother's arrest, the spokesman said.
   Daniels, who was being held on $50,000 bond at a city jail, was
charged with operating a drug factory, possession of cocaine,
possession with intent to sell cocaine, sale of narcotics and
conspiracy to sell narcotics, police said.
   John Daniels, a state legislator, took office Jan. 1 with a
pledge to step up the war on drugs in this coastal city best known
as the home of Yale University.
   The mayor came out strongly in favor of a plan by Gov. William
O'Neill to send state troopers into New Haven to help fight
drug-related crime. The program, which was opposed by the local
police union, got under way last month.
   Tuesday's arrest gives the mayor an added personal incentive
``to see this drug menace cleared from the streets,'' Lum said.
   The arrest resulted from a monthlong investigation of a house
suspected of being a center of drug activity, said police Lt. James
Sorrentino.
   Three people were arrested in a raid on the house last Thursday,
and a warrant was issued for Robert Daniels' arrest, Sorrentino
said.
   Two television stations reported the search turned up three
ounces of cocaine.
   Lum said Robert Daniels had not been involved with his brother's
political campaign but said he had no other biographical
information about him.

   Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the Paris-based Doctors of the

   The state's first female attorney general
went on the offensive and sued the federal government over its
order that Virginia Military Institute accept women.
   State Attorney General Mary Sue Terry filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Roanoke on Monday less than an hour after the
institute voted to uphold its men-only admission policy.
   The lawsuit asks the court to declare the policy constitutional
at the 150-year-old tax-supported school in Lexington.
   Terry named U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the
Justice Department as defendants in the lawsuit, which came a week
after the department threatened to sue the state over the

   The Archdiocese of Washington says it will
excommunicate any Catholics who join Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.'s
breakaway African-American Catholic Congregation.
   The archdiocese announced Monday that Stallings and his
followers had been excommunicated over Stallings' public break from
the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``By his public declaration that he has separated himself from
the church and by his renunciation of church teaching, Father
Stallings has excommunicated himself,'' the archdiocese said in a
statement by Vicar General William Kane.
   ``Any Catholic who would knowingly and willingly renounce his or
her Catholic faith to become a full and active member of Father
Stallings's congregation would also incur automatic
excommunication,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Passions Mount in Soviet Moldavia for Reunion with Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The republic of Moldavia secedes from
the Soviet Union and becomes part of neighboring Romania? For a
growing number of native Moldavians it would be going home _
Moldavia was Romanian until Stalin seized it 50 years ago.
   ``There's nothing unnatural in our people's desire to reunify,''
said Leonida Lari, a poet who represents Moldavia in the Soviet
Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow. ``We are as Romanian as
those living across the border.''
   Romania's revolution against Nicolae Ceausescu has awakened a
passion among native Moldavians for reunification and it has grown
so intense that even the republic's leaders may find it difficult
to control.
   Leaders on both sides of the Prut River border, mindful of the
dangers for Romania as it rebuilds and the Soviet Union as it
lurches from one ethnic crisis to another, say the future
relationship between Romania and the territory Josef Stalin
attached to his empire in 1940 need not be decided now.
   But the first calls of ``Unire'' (unity) echoed through this
Moldavian capital at the start of the Romanian revolt in December.
   Moldavians speak a nearly identical language as Romanians and
admire the same cultural heroes.
   But during their history, they often have been separated. Before
the breakup of czarist Russia in 1917, Moldavia was the Russian
province of Bessarabia. Many Russians, Ukrainians and Jews have
lived in Moldavia for generations.
   Inspired by the Romanian revolution, thousands of Moldavians
took to the streets in a show of support for the anti-Ceausescu
forces. Some young people offered to cross the border to join the
battle. The republic's government, as well as the Moldavian
People's Front movement, sent medicine and food.
   The People's Front already had been pressing demands on Moscow
for greater autonomy. It won a battle to establish Moldavian as the
official language of the republic and returned to the Latin
alphabet used by Romanians, dropping the Cyrillic letters imposed
under Stalin.
   The People's Front has drawn thousands into the streets of
Kishinev for rallies, and even its opponents acknowledge it is
likely to sweep local elections this spring.
   In the wake of the revolution, People's Front leaders still
treat the issue of reunification cautiously, mindful of dangers for
themselves as well as for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Today we are not putting the issue of reunification among the
urgent tasks,'' said Nicolae Kostin, the 53-year-old chairman of
the group's executive committee. ``We will not attempt any steps in
this direction without analyzing carefully how that may backfire
against Gorbachev and his policy of perestroika.''
   Ms. Lari said in an interview that she worries a determined push
for reunification with Romania could lead to military intervention
or even a coup against Gorbachev.
   For now, People's Front leaders say they would be satisfied with
what they call a ``Brandenburg variant,'' which envisions broader
contacts across the border without full reunification. Berlin's
Brandenburg Gate, after which the variant is named, became a symbol
of the division between East and West Germany and was recently
reopened to traffic and travelers.
   But that course may not satisfy Moldavians who are the most
intense about reunification and are disgruntled with the Soviet
system.
   A 19-year-old student who identified herself only as Tanya said
reunification with Romania now offers Moldavians a chance to escape
communism.
   ``We are sick and tired with the way we have to live only
because some half-literate leader `Can't let down the ideals of
socialism' _ and we all have to suffer for it. Secession is the
only chance for us to live properly and enjoy life while it is not
too late, while we are still young.''
   ``We have been lied to for 72 years,'' said Valentin Barda, a
40-year-old printer. ``Now it's time we went our separate ways. We
will go to any length to achieve reunification.''
   The People's Front president, Ion Hadirka, said that after the
Romanian revolution, some members of organization broke away and
formed the Stephan Chel Mare society. Named for Stephan the Great,
the 15th century Romanian king whose statue stands in a Kishinev
park, it calls for the question of reunification to be decided
immediately.
   And there are other indications the People's Front has little
control over more radical elements pressing for reunification.
   In November, demonstrators climbed on Soviet tanks to halt the
traditional Revolution Day military parade and attacked the
Interior Ministry headquarters with gasoline bombs, stones and iron
rods.
   Many of them refused to listen to People's Front leaders who
appealed for calm.
   Protesters calling for Russians to leave the republic of 4.2
million people and chanting ``Long live Greater Romania'' now share
the streets with reinforced police patrols.
   Vladimir Solonar, an ethnic Ukrainian leader of the Unity
movement formed to protect the rights of the 1 million Russians,
Ukrainians and other minorities in Moldavia, said he fears the
People's Front might be too disorganized to control the situation.
   The new Moldavian Communist Party chief, Pyotr Luchinsky, told
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that ethnic tension is his
biggest worry. Demands for reunification were primarily an
emotional reaction to the Romanian revolution, he said.
   He added that the ``absolute majority of residents of the
republic are not for union with Romania but for more intensive
contacts with our neighbor.''
   Mikhail S. Platon, a deputy premier of Moldavia, said, ``We
would like to raise the issue in such a way that people could
travel (to Romania) by car or by bus, to go to the theater, to meet
each other freely.''
   But if reunification comes, Nina Tsurcanu, an ethnic Russian
with a husband and 3-year-old son, says she won't be part of it,
even it means breaking up the family.
   ``My husband is Moldavian,'' she explained. ``I love him, but if
he decides to stay here after they secede, I will leave no matter
what. I will go away with my son and parents. ...
   ``They call us occupants and oppressors. My parents came here
after the war to help restore the ruined industry. Do we deserve
all this now?''
   As young people marched recently in Kishinev with Romanian flags
and shouts of ``Russians, go away! Long live Greater Romania,'' a
lanky Russian youth of 14 named Alex wondered about his future.
   He said that his Moldavian friends no longer have anything to do
with him and that his parents are thinking of moving to the
industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, where they
have relatives.
   ``I wonder if there are some native people there, too, who don't
want Russians,'' he said.

   ``Men Don't Leave''
   
   Beth Macauley wanders catatonically through the basement web of
a Maryland hospital, trying to find the morgue so she can check the
remains of her dead husband. She throws open a door and happens
upon a bevy of chefs chopping up raw chickens, and collapses into
uncontrollable sobs.
   It is this quirky blend of the ordinary, the extraordinary, the
absurd and the surreal that makes Paul Brickman's ``Men Don't
Leave'' more than just another soapy look at a family tragedy.
   Jessica Lange continues to fascinate with her range of emotions
and faces. As Beth, she reverts to an unexceptional housewife and
mother, whose entire existence is focused on her family. When left
with a bundle of bills after her husband dies in an explosion, an
enraged teen-age son and a younger, more introverted son, she copes
by leaving comfortable suburbia for the rough and crowded confines
of Baltimore's inner city.
   She finds work as an ``assistant manager'' (a gofer, really) for
a shrill neurotic who runs a gourmet food store, and meets the
understanding ``sensitive man.'' Her youngest son, Matt (Charlie
Korsmo), takes up with a middle-class juvenile delinquent, and her
oldest son, Chris (Chris O'Donnell), finds love in the arms of an
all-knowing, all-seeing, amazon of an older woman, Jody (Joan
Cusack).
   Brickman takes us, in fits and starts, through the inevitable
mother-son fights and confrontations, bouts of depression, lessons
in friendship, loyalty and trust. In the end, it all works out:
Beth learns acceptance and believes in herself.
   But the package is not as neat as it sounds. Beth's journey is
all too episodic, like a made-for-television movie. And there are
too many cute pieces of business, such as when she delivers a
basket of lunch to a rehearsing orchestra and drops oranges along
the way and finally the entire basket.
   Brickman seems to see middle-class America through barbed wire
glasses and he takes marvelous risks. In ``Risky Business,'' he
gave us an aspiring college student who earned money by turning his
parents' house into a brothel. It was funny and it worked.
   In ``Men Don't Leave,'' Mrs. Average Upstanding Housewife learns
to like her child's lover, a woman close to her own age.
   Cusack is a delight as the ``older woman.'' She steals the scene
the minute she appears, commanding presence that she is with her
measured tone and wide-eyed wonder.
   The yougsters are fine without being cloying. Corey Carrier, as
the juvenile thug Winston Buckley, is carved from the same mold
that coughed up the Little Rascals decades ago. He's bad, but he's
cute.
   Brickman directed from a screenplay written by himself and
Barbara Benedek. The story was by Benedek. The Brickman-Jon Avnet
Production is released by the Geffen Company and is rated PG-13.

   ``Mountains of the Moon''
   
   When ``Lawrence of Arabia'' was re-released last year in all its
big-screen, uncut glory, the cry went up: ``Why don't they make
movies like this anymore?'' Answer: They do.
   ``Mountains of the Moon'' has all the excitement, adventure and
human conflict of ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' While the Carolco
production may lack the polish that perfectionist David Lean gave
to his 1962 classic, ``Mountains'' is still first-rate movie
storytelling.
   The discovery of the source of the Nile in the mid-19th century
was as clouded in controversy as the journey to the North Pole a
half-century later. The contenders: Richard Burton, the
larger-than-life Irish adventurer-author-scientist; and John Speke,
an English army officer from an aristocratic family.
   Director Bob Rafelson and William Harrison based the script on
Harrison's biographical novel about the two explorers as well as
their original journals. What emerges is a complex tale of two men
of widely divergent backgrounds who become brothers on their
perilous journey.
   The African adventure is magnificently portrayed, and it is
bookended by episodes in England that are less engaging. The first
part delineates the characters of Burton (Patrick Bergin), a
dashing, adventurous figure who wins the heart of a strong-willed
English lady (Fiona Shaw); and Speke (Iain Glen), a blond,
blue-blooded young man who comes under the sinister influence of a
homosexual publisher (Richard E. Grant).
   The final part of the film concerns the aftermath of the
exploration, as the two comrades are torn apart by misunderstanding
and dispute over which one should be honored by the National
Geographic Society.
   Rafelson conveys the complicated story with admirable concision.
Despite the cost, some big scenes last only a few seconds, just
long enough to establish needed story points. Known mostly for
intimate films such as ``Five Easy Pieces'' and ``Stay Hungry,''
Rafelson displays a rare talent for the epic. His battle scenes are
extraordinary.
   Bergin captures all the brusque authority and zest for life of
Burton. In the less showy role as Speke, Glen is equally
impressive. Fiona Shaw is wise, knowing and sensual as Mrs. Burton.
   The Tri-Star release was produced by Daniel Melnick and bears an
R rating, presumably for brief nudity and considerable violence.
Running time: 135 minutes.

   Ave Verum Corpus: Motets and Anthems by William Byrd (Collegium)
_ The Cambridge Singers, directed by John Rutter.
   Peter Philips: Paradisus Sacris Cantionibus (Accent) _ Currende,
directed by Erik Van Nevel.
   
   It is a comfort to have a recording at last of William Byrd's
``Non vos relinquam orphanos'' (``I will not leave you
comfortless'').
   Not even two minutes long, the motet is a little masterpiece of
Elizabethan music. Byrd combines a powerful feeling of sadness at
parting with a quietly affirmative ``alleluia.''
   Though he enjoyed the patronage of the Protestant Queen
Elizabeth I, Byrd clung to his Roman Catholic faith _ a devotion
that cost others their lives. ``Non vos relinquam,'' like most of
his later work, was written for Catholic services held in homes and
probably sung by musical amateurs.
   The Cambridge Singers, all adults, never approach the grandeur
of a cathedral choir of men and boys. However, with 71 minutes of
music and excellent notes, it's an exemplary addition to the small
but growing number of Byrd recordings.
   Peter Philips was also an English Catholic and may have been
Byrd's pupil before fleeing to the Low Countries, but he belonged
to another world.
   ``Ecce vicit leo'' (``Behold the lion''), the first of the 22
motets presented by the Belgian choir Currende, sounds very like
Giovanni Gabrieli's double-choir compositions for St. Mark's
Cathedral in Venice.
   The feeling is confident, extravagant, in contrast to Byrd's
restraint.
   Philips has been sorely neglected in recordings, and this
generous, polished recording is a solid beginning.

   ``Evidence'' (Chrysalis) _ Boo Hewerdine and Darden Smith
   
   This is a serendipitous musical meeting that almost makes the
Traveling Wilburys seem calculated by comparison.
   Boo Hewerdine fronts an obscure British band called the Bible.
Darden Smith is a struggling Texas singer-songwriter. In New York
City for the 1988 New Music Seminar, they were introduced by a
mutual friend, hit it off and began writing songs together. It took
just eight days to write a terrific album's worth of songs.
   ``Evidence'' exudes good feeling. This is folk-rock with a
smile, music with the spark of inspiration close to the surface.
``Out of This World'' vividly evokes the walking-on-air feeling of
new love, and does it with such simplicity that nursery rhymes are
quoted for lyrics. On ``Reminds Me a Little of You,'' a listener
can practically feel the presence of the woman for whom the
narrator is pining.
   Like so many albums today, the acoustic guitar is the musical
centerpiece, with other instruments added for dashes of colors.
Call it the Tracy Chapman Effect. It allows the artists to sink or
swim solely on the strength of their songs. Of the 12 songs on this
record (a lucky 13 on CD), there's not a weak cut.
   ``I want my cake mixed in with my pie,'' Hewerdine and Smith
sing on the slightly absurd ``All I Want (Is Everything).'' Here's
hoping they get their wish.

   ``Human Soul'' (RCA) _ Graham Parker
   
   Graham Parker is one of those artists the critics love but most
of the public has never heard. He's too intelligent and quirky for
Top 40 and AOR stations, and not quite radical enough for many
college stations.
   That's where home stereos come in.
   ``Human Soul,'' Parker's 12th LP, will tickle your tape deck,
rev up your record player.
   He continues in the bright pop rock groove of his last album,
``The Mona Lisa's Sister,'' but here he quickens the pace on many
tracks and cranks up his colorful imagination.
   ``Little Miss Understanding'' kicks it off with danceable,
ska-inflected sounds and typical wordplay: ``You're a woman with a
crazy man, Like a wasp that's stuck in jam, But I won't sting you
if you don't sting me.''
   After a few ballads and pop songs, Parker closes out the ``Real
Side'' _ or Side 1 _ with ``Soultime.'' The ska sound comes back
bigger _ with horns reminiscent of The Specials _ and blends with a
reggae-ified beat (something he's dabbled in on other albums).
   But the real action is on the ``Surreal Side'' _ or Side 2.
   ``Everything Goes'' starts off a suite of five continuous songs
that are faster and darker than those on the flip side.
``Everything'' showcases Parker's unusual talent for combining
heavy lyrics with lighthearted, punchy melodies. To a sweet tune,
he sings about a serial killer and more mundane horrors.
   He jumps right into the hyped-up ``Sugar Gives You Energy,''
then a sardonic tale of suburbia, ``Daddy's a Postman'' and ``Green
Monkeys,'' a cryptic doodling about AIDS.
   The suite closes out with ``I Was Wrong,'' where the music stops
cold, sucked right out of existence.
   On the last cut, ``Slash and Burn,'' he bites hard, but he still
offers a head-bobbing beat.
   Parker gets more urgent with this LP than he did on his last
record or in his mellower ``Another Grey Area'' period around 1982.
The world could end dead in its tracks, just as this record does,
he suggests.
   But not if Parker can help it.

   John Marin is an artist who helped give credibility to
watercolor, and remove it as the stepchild of oil.
   Through his landscapes, treescapes, cityscapes and seascapes of
New York, Maine and New Mexico, he demonstrated a brilliant use of
color and form, running shapes and lines into ideas and form.
   For 40 years, Marin contributed to modern art. A retrospective
of his work is now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington
through April 15.
   There are close to 150 works in ``Selections and
Transformations: The Art of John Marin,'' including watercolors and
oil paintings.
   Marin was born in Rutherford, N.J., in 1870. He died in 1953.
Two of his finest watercolors are ``Wave on Rock'' (1937), and
``Related to Brooklyn Bridge'' (1928).
   In Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts has opened ``Monet in the
'90s: The Series Paintings.''
   Monet, the leading French Impressionist, is known to have done
218 ``series'' paintings, all but 12 during the 1890s when he was
in his 50s.
   He chose 16 subjects, some for their historical or cultural
significance. Among the works were 30 paintings each of grain
stacks and the Rouen Cathedral, 24 paintings of poplars, and 18 of
the Japanese bridge over his waterlily garden at Giverny.
   There are 86 in the exhibition, more than twice the number Monet
ever showed at one time. The works are on loan from all over the
world, including Leningrad, Paris, Tokyo and Boston. The show runs
through April 29 before going to the Art Institute of Chicago from
May 19 through Aug. 12, and at the Royal Academy in London from
Sept. 7 through Dec. 9.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If fate had taken a different turn, Ron
Silver would now be teaching school or working for the State
Department instead of starring in a leading contender for Academy
Awards.
   In the much-acclaimed ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' the New York
actor plays Herman Broder, a concentration camp refugee who finds
himself with three wives: Margaret Sophie Stein, the peasant who
saved him from the Nazis; Lena Olin, his tempestuous lover; and
Anjelica Huston, who had been presumed killed in the war.
   Paul Mazursky based his film on the Isaac Bashevis Singer novel,
and it's being treated gently by 20th Century Fox. The release
pattern has been slow, the studio hoping that critical raves and
favorable word-of-mouth will attract audiences to such a special
kind of movie.
   Whether ``Enemies'' wins Oscars and box-office returns, Silver
believes the film is a victory for all concerned, proving a quality
film with literary elements can get made in Hollywood.
   Silver's roots are as deeply Jewish as Herman Broder's. His
maternal grandparents came from Poland to New York's Lower East
Side, where Silver grew up. Fascinated with foreign cultures, he
gained a bachelor's degree in Chinese and Spanish at the State
University of New York at Buffalo, and a master's at St. John's
University in New York and at the Taiwan College of Culture.
   ``I dwindled into acting,'' he remarked.
   First came high school teaching: ``I thought I was a good
teacher. I cared about what I was teaching. I wanted to reach the
kids, and I wanted to make it entertaining. I wanted them to see
what they were learning had application to their lives. I'm
disappointed that when I left the school, they all didn't stand on
their desks and say, `O, Captain, my Captain' (as in `Dead Poets
Society').''
   Silver quit to continue his travels abroad for his advanced
degree. In 1968-69 he studied in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Taiwan,
India and Hong Kong. He was caught in the middle of the
China-Soviet border conflict, crossed the Soviet Union on the
trans-Siberian railroad, and was arrested in Leningrad.
   ``When I got back, I decided not to complete my Ph.D. and not to
go into the government, which I was supposed to do,'' he said. ``I
drifted for a while, took acting classes, was a social worker. I
enjoyed the acting classes, and I received a lot of encouragement
from my early teachers. I was involved in academia for the longest
time, and this was kind of fun _ to go home with a blonde and
rehearse a scene.
   ``I got lucky right away, found an agent and started getting
jobs. I don't know how tenacious I would have been if I had to
stick it through. (Acting) was not a life-long passion with me.''
   Silver has led a busy career in films (``Garbo Talks,''
``Silkwood''), theater (``Hurlyburly,'' ``Speed the Plow'') and
television ``The Billionaire Boys Club,'' ``Wise Guy''). He admits
he was not Mazursky's first choice for ``Enemies, a Love Story.''
   ``Nor was I the second choice,'' he said with a laugh. ``It
makes sense, artistically and businesswise to go with somebody who
has a name. I don't know who was approached, but I can guess:
Dustin Hoffman and Richard Dreyfuss. For one reason or another, it
didn't work out.''
   He responded immediately to Mazursky's proposal, not only
because he believed in the material.
   ``Also it was a challenge for me,'' he said, ``because it was
different from roles I had been doing, which were fairly exuberant,
aggressive, articulate, expressive people. This guy was just the
opposite.''
   Silver sees one element favoring the movie's Oscar chances: ``It
always seems to happen with pictures that take a long time to get
made, where there is little compromising with the integrity of the
picture. `Rain Man' had a tough time being made (also `Platoon' and
`Ghandi'). It was a real labor of love for the director, and a lot
of studios turned it down.''
   ``Enemies'' was first developed by Mazursky at Touchstone
Pictures, which had a winner with his ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills.'' The Disney people finally decided against proceeding, and
the film ended up with the independent Morgan Creek. Fox is the
releasing company.
   Silver admits he would love to see ``Enemies,'' and incidentally
himself, receive Academy honors. The reason for the allure of Oscar?
   ``This country likes winners. They treat winners very
specially,'' he said, laughing. ``The president refers to `the
winning team.' He doesn't talk about `the losing team.' He doesn't
say, `Hey, listen, you guys had a tremendous amount of character _
who cares who won?' This country is about winning.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Artists Struggle to Preserve Afghan Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashraf Anjoorgar leans closer to his
makeshift canvas to dab a more wishful shade of blue at the sky
above the Minaret of Jam.
   His painting shows the 900-year-old monument in central Ghor
province as it looked before the damage and neglect wrought by more
than a decade of Afghanistan's civil war.
   Ashraf works by light that filters through sand-bagged windows
at Kabul University's fine arts building. There is no heat or
electricity.
   ``A lot of our most talented artists have left because of the
war,'' he said with the help of an interpreter. ``There are many
young artists who want to learn but there is a shortage of
materials to teach them.''
   He made his canvas by stretching a piece of bed linen over a
wooden frame. There aren't enough brushes, paints or materials such
as gypsum and marble for sculpture.
   Ashraf is an instructor and has joined about 3,000 Afghan
painters, sculptors, musicians, dramatists, cinematographers and
architects in trying to preserve their embattled country's ancient
art and cultural traditions.
   Mohammad Haider Pardes, an architect and president of the Union
of Artists' Associations of Afghanistan, says many of his members
can earn a living only by lending their talents to the
Moscow-backed government.
   The art gallery at Kabul University, alma mater of Afghanistan
President Najib and his archrival, fundamentalist rebel leader
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, is a collage of pastoral landscapes,
depictions of archeological treasures, portraits, sculptures and
posters.
   Most have mundane motifs but the posters, especially, bear the
hard lines of a political exhortation to defend the homeland
against U.S.-backed Moslem rebels. They have fought for 11 years to
topple the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and
replace it with an all-Islamic government.
   ``Some of our artists work for the government some of the time,
but otherwise they're free to (create) whatever they want,'' Pardes
said.
   ``Very few of our artists have formal training. We've been
sending them to the Soviet Union, India and East European
countries,'' he said. ``We are interested in preserving our
cultural heritage, but we are also trying to introduce our culture
to others. This (training program) helps us do both.''
   Pardes admitted, however, that the fall of several communist
governments in Eastern Europe has disrupted the program. The army
has, too. All Afghan men must serve at least once. The fine arts
faculty at Kabul are required to put in two years. Their 300
students can look forward to four after graduation if the
stalemated war lasts.
   Faculty members also must join the ruling party, Pardes said,
but not the students, most of whom are the children of party
members.
   He said that other talented Afghans either have been killed,
pressed into government service or fled the country among more than
5 million refugees. One of the country's most renowned young
painters works as a construction engineer.
   Pardes' union office is carpeted and plush. But as an architect,
he designs public housing blocks, mosques and parks for which there
is no money to build.
   Like many of Kabul's 2 million people, he hopes this year will
bring some kind of peace to Afghanistan.
   ``We're trying to preserve our heritage. Many of our finest
monuments have been destroyed. I think people don't have more
patience with this bloody situation,'' he said.
   More than 1.5 million Afghans _ a tenth of the country's pre-war
population _ are believed to have died since the 1978 Marxist coup

   Phil Collins writes his album titles last, to
reflect the the mood of the music on the album.
   His new album is ``... But Seriously.'' The first single,
``Another Day in Paradise,'' is about the homeless. There also are
songs about famine and apartheid.
   In a recent interview, Collins recalled his last solo album,
``No Jacket Required'' in 1985.
   ``Apart from the little story of a Chicago hotel that wouldn't
let me into the bar because I wasn't wearing a jacket, I thought
the album was hotter, more danceable material than my previous
two,'' he said. ``I wanted to do something now that had a little
bit more depth to it, for a variety of reasons.''
   One is that it follows Collins' acting and songs in the movie
``Buster,'' a film about the Great Train Robbery.
   ``Not a light subject, but the way the film treated that subject
it was kind of a romantic comedy,'' he said. ``That was fine
because it was an acting role. When I got involved with the music,
I think the results to the casual person in the street were maybe a
little light.
   ``I was working with Lamont Dozier, a hero of mine, and it was a
film project. It didn't bother me `A Groovy Kind of Love' was a
'60s song. I think a lot of people thought it was a Phil Collins
solo project and felt I was getting very, very light. That wasn't
where I was coming from.
   ``I thought, `Let me put that right with my next album.' That
was one of the reasons the content of some songs was a little
different for me.''
   Most of the album reflects romantic and other individual
concerns. ``I think they're my best collection of songs since `Face
Value,''' he said. That was his first solo album, in 1981, followed
a year later by ``Hello I Must Be Going!''
   ``After all I've done, it is nice to know the best is still yet
to come, really,'' Collins said. ``The album was great fun to
write. Not having done it for five years, many of them came easily.
There was a lot to come out.''
   He'll tour until September. ``I'd like to do another film the
end of 1990. We've got to do a Genesis album the beginning of 1991.
I don't want to get involved with a big tour again so soon after
the solo tour.
   ``By that time I'll be almost 40. I'd like to do another album,
maybe; I'd like to concentrate on films. I think we'll tour with
Genesis, because it's part of what we do. It won't be, if I can
help it, anywhere near as long as Genesis' last tour, which was 10
months.
   ``The gigs become the most important part of the day; everything
else tends to be very boring, one hotel after another, one plane
after another. I never get bored with the gigs. They're always
different. I can hea people say, `He's bored with first-class
hotels?' It does get boring. I'd rather be at home doing the
shopping.''
   Speaking of boredom, Collins said, ``There is always a risk that
people get bored with Phil Collins. That reached a peak in 1985-86
when we had five Top 5 singles with `No Jacket Required,' and
Genesis' `Invisible Touch' had five Top 5. The voice was constantly
on the radio. There was a severe danger of overkill, which is why I
took a year away from music and did `Buster.'
   ``People still played the records on the radio,'' he said. ``The
thing that sticks in my mind is a guitar player said Milwaukee had
a guaranteed Phil Collins-free weekend. When radio stations
guarantee not to play you, you know you're in trouble.
   ``I don't want to not work because people play the records too
much.''
   Some of ``... But Seriously'' was recorded in Los Angeles. David
Crosby, who sings on ``Another Day in Paradise,'' and horn players
Collins wanted to use live there. Jill Collins is from Los Angeles.
Their daughter, Lily, 10 months, will go on the 1990 tour and his
older children, a daughter 17 and son 13, will join them in
Australia on their spring break.
   While recording, Collins said there are technical things that
can thicken the voice, such as echoes.
   ``They're security blankets some singers use to mask
inadequacies,'' he said. ``I was guilty of that. My voice became a
bit of a sound rather than just the voice. I think my singing has
gotten better over the last few years. I expose it more on this
album; I use less effects.''
   Since ``Buster,'' which came out in late 1988, Collins produced
three songs on Stephen Bishop's album and played on ``Woman in
Chains,'' Tears for Fears' current single.
   ``Eric Clapton, who is one of my best friends, was making his
album around the same time I did my album. He played on mine; I
played on his,'' Collins said.
   He didn't expect his success, and it has always surprised him.
``If you take things for granted, that's when the trouble starts.
   ``People say, `Why is it what you do appeals to other people?' I
have no idea. If I knew, then I'd probably screw it up,'' he said.
   ``Maybe I write lyrics that are very direct. People understand
them and relate to them. Maybe that's why what happens happens.
Apart from that, you do it to please yourself first. If other
people like it, that's great.''

   Under the living room carpet in the
converted barn author Ken Kesey calls home is a wrestling mat that
has cushioned roughhousing with his four children and is a
touchstone for the life he leads on his farm.
   ``I've always been very tight with my family,'' said Kesey, who
saw both his sons follow in his footsteps as wrestlers for the
University of Oregon. ``It's always been the most important thing
in my life.''
   Kesey has lived on this farm since 1965, after his novels, ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes a Great Notion,'' won
him literary fame. His father and brother both owned it before him.
   ``When I was working on `Sometimes a Great Notion,' one of the
reasons I could do it was because I was unknown,'' he said. ``I
could get all those balls in the air and keep them up there and
nothing would come along and distract me. Now there's a lot of
stuff happens that happens because I'm famous. And famous isn't
good for a writer. You don't observe well when you're being
observed.''
   Many of the outbuildings on the farm were built by the Merry
Pranksters he led in the psychedelic bus trip across America
chronicled by Tom Wolfe in ``The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test.'' The
bus, called Further, is parked out back.
   ``Everybody in my family knows what I've done. I've smoked dope
and would still be smoking dope if I could get some,'' Kesey said.
   ``I know enough about drugs ... to know that you can't really be
a good family person and take certain types of drugs. They turn you
into yourself. Cocaine and the opiates. Any of the barbiturates.
Booze. Those harm your family.
   ``But the real psychedelics, they increase your awareness of the
spiritual forces around you, which I think increases your love. I
don't know anybody who ever had family problems because of smoking
marijuana. They may have had financial problems because they're too
lazy to get up and go to work, but they always like to hang around
and play with the kids and the dogs, be in the kitchen.''
   Kesey got his first taste of LSD in the early 1960s in
government-run experiments in Menlo Park, Calif., where he also was
studying writing under Wallace Stegner at Stanford University. His
first novel, ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' was published in
1962.
   ``I felt like I was doing as American a thing as Neil Armstrong
when he volunteered to go to the moon,'' Kesey said of the drug
experiments. ``There was a new place to be explored and we were
astronauts.
   ``That exploration of new territory is a very American thing.
Say you're doing cocaine, that is not exploration of new territory.
That's just a titillation.''
   Most recently, Kesey has been giving performances of ``Tricker
the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear,'' a story told by his
grandmother and set to music by a neighbor, Art Maddox.
   He figures that videotapes of writers reading their works into
the camera's eye, interspersed with actors presenting scenes, will
take the place of books. His son, Zane, has done a ``Tricker''
piece that cuts between Kesey with the orchestra, and Kesey
lip-syncing in the swamp behind his home.
   ``It will take over for about 50 or 70 years and then all that
machinery will fall apart and we'll be back to the printed word,''
Kesey said.
   Kesey has taken a lot of heat for not producing another novel to
put beside the first two, but he is halfway through one now and
under contract to finish it this year.
   ``There's a saying from (William) Faulkner, who said every so
often the dog has to go against the bear just to keep calling
himself a dog. The novel is the real bear.''
   Called ``Sailor's Song,'' the book is set in a fishing village
on the coast of southeastern Alaska a little bit in the future,
when things are bleaker and more hedonistic than they are now.
   ``I think it's about love at the end of the world,'' Kesey says.
``Can you love when you know things are coming to an end?''
   The main characters are an Indian woman and a crop-duster who
moves to town from Fresno, Calif., after the death of his child.
Before leaving California, he loads his plane from a truck that
pumps out portable toilets and sprays the state fair.
   When not working on the novel, Kesey is involved with his wife,
Faye, who was his high school sweetheart, and their children,
Shannon, Zane, Jed and Sunshine, who all grew up on the farm. Jed
was buried here after his death in 1984, in the crash of a van
carrying the University of Oregon wrestling team to Pullman, Wash.
   ``I learned something from Jed's death, which is how badly it
hurts and that if I were to die, it would hurt other people, and I
don't want to hurt other people,'' Kesey said. ``I button my seat
belt and wear my life jacket. I used to think it's my life, I can
do with it what I want. But it's not just my life.''
   Recently, he and Zane planted some trees along the property
line. At 54, Kesey doesn't expect to see the trees reach maturity,
but feels they are part of the chain that is family.
   Kesey has a granddaughter, Katherine Grace, born to Shannon
shortly after New Year's Day, and he is angered that many Americans
doom their progeny by despoiling the environment.
   ``It used to be that old people, instead of spending their money
at the end of their life, would be passing that money on to their
children and grandchildren,'' Kesey said. ``But now, we've been
taught to go ahead and waste it, fill the sky with poison _ we're
not going to be here anyway.
   ``I have vowed not to do that. This piece of land won't move out
of this family. Once you bury a kid on your land, it would take a
bulldozer and a large government to move you.''
   Kesey recalled how several years ago, a busload of people
stopped by on their way from California to Kansas and asked Kesey
to come along.
   ``They all had a vision that the whole West Coast was going to
fall in the ocean and they were all moving to Kansas,'' Kesey said.
``They were the messiest bunch. When they finished with a can they
just threw it. People's clothes were dirty. Their hair was uncut.
They were angry with us for not joining them.
   ``They were sitting there and Faye got up and came back with a
big knife and saw. I said, `Where are you going?' She said, `I'm
going to go prune the fruit trees.'
   ``That's my feeling. Even if it is going to fall into the ocean,
you still have got to prune the fruit trees and wash the dishes and
take care of the daily chores of keeping the world running.''

   Ken Kesey took 12 writers from the
University of Oregon master of fine arts program into his house,
then showed them the tricks of writing a novel by having them
produce one.
   Like many first efforts, this one started awkwardly, with Kesey
knocking himself cold on a window frame trying to break into the
house he uses in Eugene because he forgot the key.
   But the ending was a happy one. Viking Penguin bought the
manuscript and in January released ``Caverns,'' by O.U. Levon,
taken from UO Novel spelled backwards.
   ``Caverns'' is set in 1934, chosen by Kesey because it is the
year before his own birth. The psychedelic pioneer of the 1960s is
the author of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes a
Great Notion.''
   The story for ``Caverns'' describes how carnival huckster
Charles Oswald Loach is released from San Quentin, where he is
serving 20 years for murder, to lead an expedition aboard an Army
surplus field ambulance to a mysterious cave purported to contain a
wild mix of prehistoric paintings that challenge the basic tenets
of anthropology.
   ``We didn't set a high standard,'' Kesey said of the book, which
was published in paperback on soft paper to give it a pulp fiction
feel. ``If we had decided to write (Thomas Pynchon's) `Gravity's
Rainbow,' we would be still writing, or we would have stopped
writing.''
   Kesey had everyone develop a character. They evolved into Loach,
his desert rat brother, a girl who grew up in Loach's carnival act,
a white supremacist brick maker, a sailor, an anthropologist, a
priest, an alcoholic newspaperman, a would-be movie producer and
two old-maid spiritualist sisters.
   Unlike the collaborative novels in which writers have taken a
chapter to themselves, this one was written with everyone pulling a
piece of each chapter out of a hat, then getting 30 minutes to
write it. Afterward the book went through two revisions.
   ``If you've got a good point guard and two power forwards and
keep moving the ball around, somebody's going to score,'' Kesey
said.
   The method also minimized individual style and the shark attacks
so common in writing workshops.
   ``You were in fine shape if you started out the chapter,'' said
H. Highwater Powers. ``You could lay it out. If you were the last
person you had to adjust. You had to think on your feet.''
   Kesey said that was one of the great lessons of the class.
   ``In the hard and sticky and dry parts that you come to in your
life or your work, all you have to do is put one foot in front of
the other and pretty soon you find yourself in places you didn't
expect to be,'' he said. ``There's no way you can teach that. You
can only learn that.''
   He recalled one discussion when someone complained that the plot
had taken an unbelievable turn.
   ``I said, `That's the job of the writer,''' Kesey said. ``We've
got to take the square peg and jam it into the round hole.
   ``The life of it comes from making people believe that these
people are drawing breath and standing up, casting shadows, and
living lives and feeling agonies.
   ``And that's a trick. It's a glorious trick. And it's a trick
that you can be taught. It's not ... just a thing that comes from
the muses.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: John Davidson Is Cooking Now</HEAD>

   TV entertainer John Davidson has given
up lizards for pecan pie.
   Davidson, who confronted the giant reptile as host of ``That's
Incredible,'' currently is whipping up tasty treats on cable TV's
``Holiday Gourmet,'' a cooking show on The Nashville Network.
   Davidson and his wife, Rhonda, make desserts on the 60-minute
program, which is broadcast at various times the week before each
Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas and
Valentine's Day.
   He's no stranger to cooking, and calls himself ``a good
assistant cook'' at home.
   ``There are three or four recipes I keep repeating. One is
Polynesian peanut butter chicken, which I found in New Zealand. And
I make a mean banana french toast. But really I do my best just as
a chopper and cutter for Rhonda.''
   TNN, which has broadened its scope and reached beyond Nashville
for celebrities such as Davidson, says ``Holiday Gourmet'' has
generated more than 13,000 letters a year from viewers seeking
recipes or commenting about the show.
   ``Holiday Gourmet'' featured country music stars making their
favorite recipes last year, but the Nashville performers were
dropped this season to focus more on Davidson. He joins Dinah Shore
and Florence Henderson as non-country music hosts of TNN programs,
which are available in 48 million households throughout the country.
   On ``Holiday Gourmet,'' three chefs prepare dishes such as roast
turkey, meat loaf and pasta. Davidson and his wife tackle less
complicated recipes such as alpine white pecan pie, chocolate
mincemeat squares and chocolate raspberry coconut squares.
   Cooking is the focus, though Davidson also sings.
   The 48-year-old Davidson, who's associated with such shows as
``Hollywood Squares'' and ``That's Incredible,'' says his wife may
have upstaged him on the cable show.
   ``They (show executives and crew) were more impressed with
Rhonda than me,'' he said cheerfully in a telephone interview from
his Los Angeles-area houseboat. ``Everyone said, `Your wife was
great.' No one said much about me.''
   Rhonda, a former background singer with little TV experience,
said she was surprised at the positive reception she received.
   ``I've always been more of a background person with no desire to
be out front,'' she said. ``I expected to be nervous, but people
put me at ease because they were so warm and kind. John was
supportive, too.
   ``I just went on the show and did my John Davidson impression.
I've watched him work and seen how he deals with the audience and
how he conducted himself.''
   For Davidson, who has sung some country songs during his career,
the series is yet another outlet for showcasing his TV talents.
   He just finished three years as host of ``Hollywood Squares,''
which has gone out of production but is still seen in reruns. He
was host of ``That's Incredible'' in 1981-86 and ``Incredible
Sunday'' in 1988 and 1989. He had a syndicated talk-variety show,
``The John Davidson Show,'' from 1980 to 1982. He also had ``The
John Davidson Show'' in 1966, 1969 and 1976 as part of ``The Kraft
Summer Music Hall.''
   He has been host on numerous TV specials such as ``The Golden
Globe Awards,'' ``Miss World Competition,'' ``Miss Junior America''
and ``Mother and Daughter Pageant.'' He currently is also seen on
ESPN's ``Boating World'' show.
   ``I always have three or four projects going at one time,''
Davidson said. ``I'm spread out.''
   He believes the future of cable TV, the home of his programs on
TNN and ESPN, is limitless.
   ``Producers have to find a place for their shows and they are
turning to cable,'' Davidson said. ``In the next five years, I
think the TV dial is going to be like a radio dial. You'll have
trouble knowing which is a network station or a cable station or an
independent. It'll be all one happy dial and you'll turn it just
like on the radio.''
   Davidson used to be a guest on ``Hollywood Squares'' when Peter
Marshall was host, then ended up in Marshall's chair posing
questions to the celebrities who would try to stump contestants.
   ``I liked to bluff and fool people and give an esoteric,
impressive answer and try to seem erudite,'' he said. ``In fact, I
didn't know the answer, but I got a lot of laughter that way.''
   Davidson said his most memorable segment on ``That's
Incredible'' was when he entered the cage of a giant lizard. ``They
locked the cage on me, or pretended to, and I've never been more
frightened in my life. It was scary.''

<HEAD>Retired Execs Teach Novices How to Succeed in Small Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an age of multibillion-dollar buyouts and
mergers, an unassuming army of 13,000 is teaching Americans to
think small.
   Members of the volunteer Senior Corps of Retired Executives draw
on decades of business experience as they offer free, one-on-one
counseling to people who are just getting started in small business
or who need help moving ahead.
   ``Since we have attained hard-won skills in our business lives,
this is the best way we can volunteer,'' said Ann Oxley, a SCORE
member from Fort Wayne, Ind., who volunteered for a year as the
group's marketing director here.
   ``It's refreshing to see that you can use what you learned from
all the bumps and slashes you got going through the business
jungle.''
   SCORE, sponsored by the Small Business Administration, has
13,000 active members, 80 percent retirees and 20 percent active
businesspeople. Those still in business generally help put on
workshops that SCORE offers its clients for a small fee. With more
than 750 chapters and satellite groups nationwide, SCORE has served
more than 3 million people over the past 25 years.
   Just recently, SCORE and the SBA sent out a notice seeking
information on retirees with language skills that might be useful
as Eastern European nations open to the West. Volunteers may be
asked to help translate publications or speak to foreign
delegations.
   John Daniels, executive director and one of only seven fulltime
paid employees, said SCORE's impact is hard to measure in dollars
and cents, but success stories abound.
   In Hostetter, Pa., SCORE counselor Lou Sabers helped the
struggling volunteer fire department cut its loan payments in half
by obtaining a special 2 percent emergency loan from the state.
``They told us they were on the brink of bankruptcy,'' Sabers said.
   In Independence, Mo., Norman Westheimer, a 78-year-old former
vice president of the former GEM Corp., helped Brenda Louderback
revamp her ad strategy for Diessl Jewelers and analyze her
profit-and-loss statements. ``I only wish I had studied harder and
followed more closely the advice and input that was so generously
offered,'' Louderback said.
   In San Diego, 76-year-old David Gilbert _ with 30 years in the
import-export business _ helped brothers Jim and Joseph Hadzicki
turn their prototype giant kite into Revolution Kites, which racked
up $500,000 in sales its first year. ``It was nice to have somebody
who had been through this kind of stuff before who could recommend
the proper steps,'' said Jim Hadzicki.
   Other less-evident successes are found in the ranks of people
who decide not to go into business or to postpone it after SCORE
members lay out the demands of running a small business and the
potential pitfalls.
   A survey of SCORE clients in the Midwest found that 27 percent
had canceled or delayed plans to go into business after contacting
the organization, in some cases preserving savings that otherwise
might have been lost to failure.
   ``We have people who think about taking their retirement money
and opening up a pizza parlor right across the street from a Pizza
Hut,'' Daniels said.
   ``We have prevented many, many casualties, which is good for the
American economy as well as for the individual ego. It's crushing
to fail,'' Oxley said.
   SCORE in many cases is able to match retired executives with
novices who need advice in the same area of expertise, Daniels
said. The organization keeps a special roster of those with
international trade experience in order to help small business
people expand their exports. ``There are many opportunities over
there, but you have to know your way around,'' he said.
   SCORE counselors, who have an average of 35 years of business
experience, say they benefit themselves even as they help others
get started in business.
   Westheimer has been a SCORE counselor for 15 years and still
puts in about 10 hours a week. ``It keeps an individual alert and
it's an area where you can be of assistance to people who may be
having problems,'' he said.
   Westheimer became Louderback's counselor in 1985 and she still
calls him from time to time with questions about the jewelry
store's operations. ``The thing I like about it is there's no `I
told you-so' or anything like that. He'll suggest books to read or
ways to find information.
   ``If we want to do it, it's up to us.''
   While Revolution Kites is well on it way, Jim Hadzicki still
calls Gilbert for occasional advice. For example, Hadzicki knew he
should take gifts when he visited potential customers in Japan, but
he didn't know what to take. He went with Gilbert's suggestions of
Black Label scotch for the men and Estee Lauder products for the
women. ``It was just nice to talk to somebody before going.''
   The oldest active SCORE counselor has been 93-year-old W.P.
Campbell of Searcy, Ark., who recently decided he'll move to
inactive status after handling cases for 22 years. ``Whenever you
do something for other people, you get a big kick out of it,
especially when you do it without pay.
   ``It gives you a wonderful feeling.''

<HEAD>Quilting Brings Together Pieces of Small-Town Life</HEAD>

   It is a quilt the women of St.
Mary's Church are sewing, calloused fingers punching tiny needles
through thick layers of cloth, but what they bind together is a
community.
   The talk in the basement of the clapboard church is about babies
and sewing patterns, husbands who spent the fall hunting and sons
moving back to town.
   ``... They bought a house ... ''
   ``They move away to make money and then they come back. That
keeps the town going...''
   The chat is as pieced as the pink-and-blue, hearts-and-diamonds
quilt top sewn together at home by Cheryl Rexroat Bunek, who's so
busy with six children and her husband's plumbing business to run
that she can't come to quiltings.
   No conversation goes deep at the biweekly winter meeting of the
St. Mary's quilters, a dozen women around two large quilts
stretched across lumber frames. The quilts, like the women who make
them, generation after generation, stitch together life in this
tiny northern Michigan town, population 368.
   ``We never gossip,'' insists Mildred Kirt, 81, a thin woman with
a cap of short, charcoal gray curls. Her son, Mike, moved back 10
years ago.
   The cold air off Lake Michigan chases two more women down the
stairwell. They add their coats to the pile on the table, their
fingers to the sewing and their voices to the conversation.
   Talk and sew, talk and sew. The ladies of St. Mary's have been
doing this to raise money for the church further back than anyone
can recall, an endless succession of patterns that mirror their
lives: courthouse steps, double wedding ring, Grandma's flower
garden, seven sisters.
   It's a rich tradition of small-town life centered on an aging
church and a country parish of 250 families. The farmers' co-op is
closed and the train depot is gone, but St. Mary's endures.
   ``There wouldn't be much of a town if there wasn't the church,''
says Lynn Edwards, adding a swirling border to frame the calico
heart Mildred is sewing.
   ``For these people, the church is still a center of life, their
social life,'' says the Rev. Walt Derylo. ``Here, you take a step
back in time.''
   He is talking from St. Michael's Church, four miles away in
Suttons Bay. St. Mary's has no resident pastor; there's a shortage
of priests in the church.
   The women talk about that, too.
   ``The Pope should let priests marry,'' one says.
   These women's mothers in 1904 made a signature quilt to raise
money for the church. A dime donation embroidered your place in
devotion, your name stitched in red around the silhouette of St.
Mary's.
   The spread was won at raffle by a priest, who gave it to a
family that needed it for warmth against the Michigan night. The
Leelanau peninsula was timbered bare by then. Poor potato farmers
were all that were left. The rolling peninsula wasn't yet planted
in the quaint cherry orchards that would attract tourists from
Chicago and Detroit, antique shops and condominium builders.
   In summer now, tourists crowd the lanes with 10-speed bicycles,
browse for antiques and take home smoked fish in paper bundles tied
with string.
   But in winter, Lake Leelanau remains shut into itself and the
old ways. The St. Mary's women meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. They
raise about $10,000 a year for the church and its pride, a
101-year-old, 13-grade school.
   The old signature quilt hangs in the Leelanau Historical Museum,
600-some faded names on rough, unbleached muslin.
   ``Gauthier, Belanger ...,'' Curator Laura Quackenbush starts to
read. ``You can see the French-Canadian influence. And the German:
the Schaubs ... Emelia Schaub. Emelia is 96 now, living at the
Omena House nursing home.
   ``She's the first woman prosecutor to practice in Michigan,
elected in 1936 and re-elected five times.'' Actually, another
woman was elected first, but was thrown out by the governor, who
said it was an illegal occupation for women.
   Quilting was part of women's work, a way to keep warm at night,
to tie a community together, to raise money for churches, schools,
the needy. Mennonite women in Oscoda County sell quilts to benefit
a world-wide hunger fund. A woman in eastern Michigan sells her
quilts to pay her son's college tuition.
   ``They used to laugh at us,'' says Barb Merica, at 59 one of the
youngest. ``They,'' are the men, but it's Barb who's laughing now,
eyes twinkling over glasses perched on the end of her nose. The
quilts go for hundreds of dollars each these days. Many never touch
a bed, instead hanging from walls like giant paintings.
   Mildred Kirt doesn't understand. ``These quilts don't seem so
fancy to me.
   ``When I was a girl, I thought my mother was so dumb to cut all
those pieces and sew them back together. But I see now, it's an
art.''
   In 70 years of sewing, Mildred has made quilts for the beds of
her four children and their 15 children and is starting on the
great-grandkids.
   Suzanne Plamondon, 75, did the same for eight kids and 16
grandchildren.
   Jen LaCross made hers for nine children and 28 grandchildren.
   There's a splash of red on the fabric. Claire Routzahn has
pricked herself, hard, and blood drips from her fingertip. She mops
it with a little water. No one pays attention. There's a lot of
blood spilt over a quilt, Barb says.
   And some pain.
   Mildred's mother, Josephine Hahnenberg, was a terror as a
quilter, exacting and demanding of the talents of young brides who
sought admission. Every careless stitch _ hundreds of them _ had to
be ripped out.
   ``I came home crying every night,'' Suzanne says. ``My husband
consoled me, told me not to give up, to stand up to this woman. He
said, `She'll respect you.''' In the end, they became good friends
and fishing buddies.
   Quilting is no longer the rite of womanhood in Lake Leelanau.
Daughters have jobs and other demands.
   It's already been a struggle to keep the group from unraveling.
Barb and Florence Scharnowski and Laura Couturier pitched in to
take over the organizing work when Flo Lamie died of cancer.
``Flo's biggest worry was would the quilting fall apart,'' Barb
says.
   Who is there to replace the replacements?
   Barb sighs. ``If we don't get young blood, like all things, it
will die.''
   The morning wears. The chatter slows. The women roll up the ends
of the finished spread as they work, scooting their chairs forward
and inward. It is godawful cold outside and getting worse as the
day develops but in the warm basement, the women of St. Mary's keep
sewing, knees to knees around an ever-shrinking quilt.

<HEAD>Divorced Over-40, Older Women Have More Financial Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By L.L. GRIMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many middle-aged and older Americans,
Carolyn Connor was raised to believe that nice people didn't get
divorced.
   But at 49, she's been married, divorced, remarried and widowed.
   ``Society raised me to think it was an embarrassment to get a
divorce. But he was an alcoholic... When I got a little money from
my grandfather's estate, it gave me the guts to leave,'' said
Connor, who was divorced at 33.
   ``It really makes me feel sorry for people who don't have the
money.''
   Sociologists say that while divorce rates have stabilized for
younger women, they are increasing for older women. And newly
divorced middle-aged and older women have a harder time financially
than widows or those divorced early.
   ``Almost everyone recognized there was a tremendous increase in
divorce rates since the 1960s,'' said Peter Uhlenberg, a University
of North Carolina sociologist. ``Divorce is concentrated in younger
women _ most occur before age 40. Women in later life, those who
are old now, have not been affected by these changes. We're trying
to anticipate what happens when women in their younger adult years
hit their 60s and 70s.''
   Uhlenberg and his associates, Teresa Cooney, now at the
University of Delaware, and Robert Boyd, presently a graduate
student at the University of South Carolina, used data from the
U.S. Census, Vital Statistics and Current Population Survey for
their study, published in the January edition of the Journal of
Gerontology: Social Sciences.
   They found that one woman in eight will have her first marriage
end in divorce after she reaches age 40. And the probability of
remarriage is slim, decreasing rapidly with age. In 1985, for
example, researchers found fewer than three out of 100 divorced
women aged 45 to 64 remarried.
   ``There are competing explanations for why more older women are
getting divorced and remaining unmarried. It's becoming more
feasible for women to support themselves outside of marriage. There
are more work opportunities. The age before marriage has gone up.
The whole idea of being married is becoming less likeable after
doing it once,'' Uhlenberg said.
   The economic status, family relationships, social support and
emotional stability of recently divorced middle-aged and older
women vary dramatically from those comparably married, widowed, or
long-termed divorced women.
   ``Much more often, a widowed woman will have a house, which is a
major asset going into old age,'' Uhlenberg said. Widowed women are
also more likely to have their husband's pension as a source of
income, but for divorced older women, the social implications are
very different.
   ``A widowed woman is much more likely to be living independently
and not working,'' he said. ``Divorced women are compensating
economically by sharing their living expenses and working.''
   ``It takes a while to recover financially from divorce,'' said
Ms. Connor, who has worked as a secretary for three years to
supplement her late husband's disabled veterans' benefits. ``And at
the time I divorced, they didn't really enforce child support. I
had my husband arrested twice for not paying and all they did was
put him in jail overnight and then let him go.''
   The picture becomes more bleak for older minority women,
Uhlenberg said.
   ``Divorce rates are significantly higher for blacks. We know
that. The economic implications are about what they are for white
women. It's just that more black women will experience economic
disadvantages.''
   Another factor affecting divorce rates is the increased
acceptability of single mothers and co-habitation before marriage,
he said. And the more these types of families exist, the less
likely children of such groups are to be socialized into the
pattern of stable family relationships.
   ``What we're doing now is looking at one of the implications of
divorce on older men,'' which will be published this month, he
said. ``Specifically, the impact of divorce on older men and their
relationship with their children.
   ``We've found that older divorced men are much less likely to
have contact with their adult children. They report the
relationship to be less satisfactory.
   ``For women, we find a greater impact on an economic level,
while for men, the implication would be in terms of social
support.''

<HEAD>Women Fare Better Than Men After Spouse's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET TRAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who are suddenly widowed survive the
trauma better than men whose spouses die unexpectedly, but when
death follows lengthy illness, men seem to handle things better, a
sociologist says.
   Studies have shown that women generally weather a spouse's death
better than men, but women's traditional role as caregiver works
against them when a death follows prolonged illness, said Ken Smith
of the University of Utah.
   ``The idea here is that women, because they are taking on more
caregiver burden, are likely to face a higher rate of mortality''
Smith said.
   Working with data from a multifaceted, nationwide study of 5,000
married couples that began in 1968, Smith studied data from 113
widowers and 383 widows over 14 years after a spouse died, and
compared each with a control couple.
   Men who suddenly became widowed were 52 percent more likely to
die within 14 years than men whose wives remained alive, while men
whose wives died after a long illness were only 13 percent more
likely to die than non-widowers.
   Women whose husbands died suddenly faced a marginal mortality
risk _ 1 percent _ but those enduring a husband's prolonged illness
and death were 49 percent more likely to die than non-widows, Smith
said.
   He speculates that a woman, more used to caregiving, is better
prepared for life after her husband's death. But she takes on a far
greater than normal burden when nursing a husband through chronic
illness.
   Men whose wives die suddenly run a higher risk of dying because
they're unable to prepare for unexpected life alone, he said. ``Men
tend not to possess the daily living skills that help to preserve
one's health. When she dies suddenly, there's a source of support
that's suddenly gone.''
   However, men adopt caregiver abilities when forced to take
responsibility for nursing a spouse through chronic illness, he
said.
   Regardless of how sudden a wife's death, said University of
Maryland psychologist Leon Levy, men have much greater difficulty
with bereavement. They ``don't have the support system women do.
Men are more isolated.''
   Jean Buchin, an adjunct professor at City University of New York
who conducts workshops for people whose spouses have died, said
Smith's study does not consider age. ``The age factor of the
widowed plays an important role. Older widows take the impact of
widowhood _ sudden or anticipated _ in general harder,
economically, emotionally and socially, than younger women.''
   Paul Costa, head of the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition
at the National Institute of Aging in Baltimore, said his own
findings show the acute bereavement of the first six months has
significant effects, while long-term grieving has virtually no
impact on mortality or long-term well-being.
   Smith agrees, but puts the maximum impact later. ``You can see
where the bereavement really kicks in. Things seem to peak at about
one year.''
   He presented his initial findings on widowhood last summer at a
conference of the Society for Epidemiologic Research, and is
revising the paper for publication by the American Journal of
Epidemiology.

   Historians say bowling dates back to ancient
Egypt, and while the members of the B'nai B'rith Sports Lodge have
witnessed more than a few decades, they deny being among the
original keglers.
   No sporadic bowlers, the 15 men _ averaging over 74 years old _
trek to the downtown Spencer Lanes every Tuesday night between
Labor Day and Passover.
   ``We come through rain and shine, even a blizzard once,'' said
Marvin Pechter, 67.
   And they have no plans to quit soon.
   ``I hope to keep at it for another 10 years,'' said Charlie
Shayne, 85, a printing company manager who prefers bowling to
almost anything else.
   ``I love it. I think you should do what you like. Summertime I
play golf, Wintertime I bowl.'' Overnight he plays cards.
   ``Give Charlie a poker game he'll stay up all night long,'' said
Pechter. ``He was late for a tournament once. And when he finally
showed up, he said he'd been up all night playing poker.''
   Setting up on the last four alleys at Spencer's, the Sports
Lodgers bowl quickly, chatting and encouraging each other on.
   ``Charlie, you're up next,'' says Pechter.
   Shayne grabs his bowling ball, studies the spots on the alley,
then spryly steps down the approach. The lefty's ball rolls less
than halfway down the alley, then veers with a little hook into the
pocket.
   Boom. Eight pins down. No. 6 and No. 10 left standing.
   Shayne gets his ball back from the machine, looks again at the
spots, then smoothly moves toward the foul line.
   Again, that little hook. Bingo. A spare.
   ``Way to go, Charlie,'' several other call out.
   Charlie grins like a kid.
   ``Bowling definitely keeps you young. You got to keep active,
not watch the boob tube. I see too many men vegetate. We have
fun,'' said Pechter, who runs a hardware store.
   The chief funny man in the Sports Lodge is Ed Kallish, 65. ``The
reason we bowl is to get away from our wives or girlfriends _ or
both.''
   The Sports Lodge is among nearly 4,000 senior leagues in the
United States, all with bowlers over 55, said Mark Miller of the
American Bowling Congress.
   Pechter, the league secretary, has all the stats: ``We got four
teams, the oldest bowler is 85, our baby is 62, the mean age is 74
or 75.''
   The league, formed a quarter century ago, has some pretty fair
bowlers.
   Benny Lavin, 79, a retired musician who once managed a bowling
alley, averages 174.
   ``I had a 716 series in 1968,'' said Kallish, a stationery
supply salesman.
   Shayne, who started bowling at 46 in 1950, averages 145.
   Often Lavin and some of the others can be seen coaching in
nearby alleys.
   ``You try to give them a helpful hint _ if they want it,''
Pechter said. ``We put a lot of years in. We're not pros _ far, far
from it. But if we can notice a bowler making a mistake, we like to
give tips.''
   At the end of the season, the Sports Lodgers party.
   ``We take out our wives out,'' Pechter said, ``to thank them for
letting us bowl.''

   ``Come on over for a bite of supper.''
   This is the kind of entertaining that is doable.
   Nothing fancy, mind you, but an easy, inexpensive casserole
dinner, with fresh seasonal greens, a crusty bread and dessert.
   It can be a pot luck, where the host and@or hostess prepare the
main dish and friends bring separate components that make up the
rest of the meal, or, if you do it all, it can take as little as
two hours. The casserole can go stove top to table top in 30
minutes and it's easy to wash fresh greens for salad, whisk
together a light vinaigrette, spread whole wheat baguettes with
herb butter and whip up a simple dessert.
   Yet, what I so often hear from friends in my travels around the
country these days is, ``Now that the kids have grown up we don't
entertain much any more,'' or, ``I seldom entertain now that I'm
alone.'' This is the very time when entertaining should be at the
top of our priority list.
   Whether we've moved to another area, from a house to an
apartment, or stayed put, entertaining is a conduit through which
we can share friendship and in opening ourselves up to each other
we gain perspective, encouragement and succor.
   People love to go to each other's houses. And informality is
often appreciated. There's no need to put on the ritz with a
three-course dinner and rich dessert. Light, simple food is
preferred, especially at this time of our lives when too many
calories and too much fat can ruin our efforts to keep fit.
   The number of people: four or six, five or seven, singles and
couples, mix and match in both ages and interests.
   The cost of this king of entertaining can be as little as $5 a
person and it enriches our lives beyond measure.
   ``I like to entertain once aa month,'' my friend, Mary Rommer,
says. ``But I don't want to go to that much bother, so I make it
really easy on myself.
   ``Use pots, platters and ovenware that can come to table. Plates
and glasses that can take the heat of the dishwasher. Runners and
placemats that don't need ironing. Foods that don't need looking
after. And casseroles that can sit around in the oven or on top of
the stove, or a big kettle.
   ``I serve just the first time around and then guests can help
themselves.''
   Here's one of my favorite casserole dinners.

   A farmer who hires teen-agers is quoted
in a village weekly as saying ``they come here thinking tomatoes
grow underground. Kids coming here to weed have plucked out my
pepper plants and have planted onions upside down.''
   Should kids know better, I wonder? I didn't start gardening
until I was 35, and was so ignorant the first time out I emptied a
whole packet of lettuce seed into a 6-foot row before my horrified
father-in-law could grab my arm.
   But my goof didn't dampen my eagerness.
   Now, nearing 74, I make a lettuce packet last four and five
years and I save wood ashes from the Franklin stove to fatten my
beets. I've agonized over frost and drought and the raccoon has
beaten me time and again to my best corn. But, learning all the
time, I look with pride at my 20-year-old asparagus bed, my
pencil-thin French beans and the gloriously red radicchio peeking
through the mulch and snow on a winter day.
   The Barefoot Boy, as John Greenleaf Whittier pictured him 135
years ago, walked hand in hand with Nature and talked to her face
to face. But was he a gardener? How many of our teen-age children
garden of their own free will?
   And how about vegetables?
   I dusted off an old Whittier and found that the lad with cheeks
of tan knew all about woodchucks, moles, turtles, robins, orioles,
wasps, groundnuts, lilies, berries and apples. But no beans or
onions in the 102 lines.
   Did Whittier forget the vegetables? Or, in America's pastoral
age, was it quietly understood that vegetables were not a leisure
activity for children? A farmer of our own day, reminiscing in The
New York Times about his childhood, regrets he never played much
baseball. ``I had to rush home from school to help my father with
the planting.''
   Aside from horticultural geniuses like Luther Burbank, many
gardeners seem to be late bloomers. In my own family, I've seen my
son, an artist, smitten in his mid-30s. He started because he
wanted to paint flowers, like Claude Monet, but quickly he was deep
into catalogs and manuals, potting soil, flats, tools, trips to
nurseries, cold frames, mulches, hoses, trellises. Even botanical
names.
   And it doesn't take forever to get pretty good. Unlike a
heartless golf ball, plants help you. They want to live and ``make
it'' as much as you do.
   A Gallup poll found gardening to be America's leading pastime,
more popular than golf, jogging, biking, tennis and swimming.
   But working the soil abounds in irony and paradox. On city
rooftops and backyards, amateurs multiply, while real farmers, once
a multitude, dwindle in the greatest agricultural nation. Some seek
loans and therapy even as a few giants achieve miracles of
production.
   Astonishing machines, with cash the ultimate target, spew out
spotless tomatoes as hard as baseballs, and as tasteless, while the
greenest amateur, barely knowing enough to water his plants, exults
over his first triumph, a juicy tomato with that old-time flavor.
   A thirtyish city friend came to see us at asparagus time.
Asparagus is one of man's oldest companions, very little different
in today's cultivated state from the wild spears harvested by our
forebears. My friend's eyes widened when he saw the purplish spears
poking up through the hay mulch, self-contained beauties all ready
for the cooking pot.
   ``Is that how they grow!?'' he exclaimed.
   I thought I read the pleasure of discovery in his eyes. Another
gardener down the road?

<HEAD>Demographer: Florida's Elderly Population Will Keep Booming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the state with the oldest population,
Florida offers lessons on dealing with the problems of a graying
America, a demographer says.
   ``The way Florida deals with this aging population could be very
instructive to the nation as a whole when it has to deal with it in
the year 2020 or 2030,'' said Stanley K. Smith, director of
population research with the University of Florida's Bureau of
Economic and Business Research.
   Those 65 and older will comprise an estimated 18 percent of
Florida's 13 million residents this year, and could hit 26 percent
by the year 2020.
   ``An older population has a major impact on such things as
health care, child care, education, the labor force and voter
participation,'' Smith said.
   However, the growing elderly population is not predicted to be a
drain on Florida's resources, as some officials fear. In fact, he
said, recent studies have shown that the economic benefit of the
elderly population far outweighs _ by four or five times _ its
demand on the social system.
   ``Florida has a unique retiree ... healthier and considerably
wealthier than the average for the United States,'' he said.
   ``And there also seems to be some evidence that when they start
to become really old, when they begin placing more demands on the
social system, they often move back to New York or Ohio or wherever
they migrated from.''

<HEAD>Researcher: Working Daughter Increase Hurts Aging Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the number working women
has hurt aging parents who have traditionally depended on their
daughters for care, says a University of Florida researcher and
author of a new book.
   Daughters, as the caregivers in many families, have less time to
cook and care for their elderly parents, said Jane Myers, professor
of counselor education and author of ``Adult Children and Aging
Parents.''
   ``Many women begin or renew careers when their children leave
home and look forward to a variety of new-found freedoms,'' Ms.
Myers said. ``The last thing they want is to suddenly have an aging
parent depending on them.''
   More elderly people, as a result, are relying on social service
programs and perhaps entering nursing homes sooner than they would
otherwise.
   ``The whole phenomenon of dealing with aging parents is very new
and it's a strain on family members that they aren't prepared
for,'' Ms. Myers said. ``As the parent's health becomes fragile and
they feel vulnerable, they want to know that the people they care
most about are there for them. So they may reach out to their
children more than they used to.''
   Retirement can be especially stressful because they may want to
get to know their grandchildren and be near their adult children,
who may be busy with their own lives and resent the intrusion, Ms.
Myers said.
   Another sore spot is the decision to place an aging parent in a
nursing home. Between 20 and 30 percent of the elderly population
can expect to spend some time in a nursing home, she said. ``The
problem with many people who enter nursing homes is that most of
the time they're OK and don't need to be there.''
   Another major problem between elderly parents and their adult
children is that both develop a lifetime of relationship patterns
that often no longer work as the parents grow old, she said.
``Don't wait until your parents get old and problems arise to try
to build a good relationship. It's much easier to deal with trouble
spots when everyone is healthy.''

   American workers' productivity rose just 0.9
percent last year _ the worst showing since the 1981-82 recession _
while hourly labor costs sped upward, the government said.
   The increase in non-farm productivity, defined as output per
hour of work, was less than half the 2 percent gain recorded in
1988, the Labor Department said Monday.
   The report showed that while productivity was slumping, hourly
labor costs _ a major inflation measure for businesses _ jumped by
5.5 percent, up from 4.7 percent in 1988 and the biggest increase
since 1982.

   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks dropped 1.5 percent in late January from a year earlier as a
strong rise in truck sales offset tumbling car sales, automakers
reported.
   Domestic truck sales rose 8.1 percent, spurred by strong sales
at Chrysler Corp., which offered incentives on its popular
minivans, while domestic car sales fell by 6.6 percent during the

   Results in the year-earlier period were inflated somewhat by
heavy fleet sales, a condition analysts said made this year's late

<HEAD>EDS Stock Dividend Raised 2-for-1 Stock Split Too</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dividend increase on General Motors Corp.'s
Class E common stock and a 2-for-1 split fulfills a promise the
automaker made when it bought Electronic Data Systems Corp. six
years ago.
   On Monday, the GM board of directors authorized the stock split
and a 17 percent increase in the dividend to 28 cents a share. GM
said the moves stemmed from growth in EDS's non-GM business.
   ``I think it is a good move on the part of GM's board,'' said
analyst Terrance Quinn of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
``Even though General Motors is having its difficulties, it's
living up to its word.''
   The board also said it was maintaining dividends on GM's regular
common stock, keyed to the company's vehicle-making and marketing
business, and on its Class H stock, which is related to the GM
Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary.
   GM's non-auto subsidiaries _ EDS, GM-Hughes and General Motors
Acceptance Corp., the group's financing arm _ are expected to
report fourth-quarter and year-end 1989 earnings next week. A day
later, GM will report profits from its vehicle operations, which
are expected to be down sharply from a year ago.
   ``The GM business has not gone anywhere,'' Quinn said. ``The
non-GM component has grown in excess of 25 percent annually within
the last two to three years.''
   The moves on the Class E stock, based on EDS performance,
indicate that while profits on GM's car and truck operations are
falling, other GM businesses are booming.
   When GM bought EDS from Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot in 1984,
it promised that the computer company's performance would not be
dependent on the automaker's overall results. It created the class
E stock to reflect EDS' performance.
   Quinn said the dividend increase and stock split are
``reflective of what EDS does outside of what GM does.''
   Class E stock has not performed up to its potential because of a
perception that it is ``another common class of GM stock,'' Quinn
said.
   ``Because it's a wholly owned subsidiary, there's a feeling that
there is no independence with it,'' he added.
   The increase in the Class E dividend, to 28 cents a share from
24 cents, also stemmed from an increased profit margin last year,
the company said. It will be payable March 10 to shareholders of
record as of Feb. 15.
   The board said the Class E stock split came as the company
completed a 10 million, pre-split share repurchase plan. GM now
will repurchase 5 million more shares of Class E stock.
   The board continued a 75 cent-a-share dividend on the company's
regular common stock, called $1 2-3 par value, and an 18
cent-a-share dividend on Class H stock. A year ago, the board
boosted the dividend and declared a 2-for-1 split on its regular
common stock.

   The government reportedly has offered Michael
Milken the chance to plead guilty to six felonies to avoid a
lengthy trial on new charges, but there was no indication the
former junk bond king would accept a deal.
   Individuals close to the case said Monday they still expect the
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive to defend his case at
a trial tentatively scheduled to begin later this year.
   The individuals, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
was no indication Milken was considering a plea deal and noted that
talks between opposing sides are common in complex federal cases.
   The case has been in a holding pattern, awaiting a new
indictment superseding the one handed up last March that charged
Milken with 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in connection with
a series of securities transactions.
   Prosecutors originally planned to bring the new charges by last
October. The government most recently said the indictment would be
ready by mid-January, but the reported talks between prosecutors
and Milken's lawyers purportedly caused the latest delay.
   Milken, through his lawyers, has proclaimed his innocence and
pledged to fight the case in court.
   The report of a plea offer was published in Monday's editions of
The Wall Street Journal.
   Prosecutors were said to have offered Milken the chance to plead
guilty to six felony counts, each of which would carry a maximum
five years in prison.
   The government would recommend to the judge that Milken serve
the counts concurrently, for a maximum of five years _ or the
equivalent of one felony charge. But a judge would not be bound by
the recommendation. None of the six counts would involve
racketeering, which carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll did not return a call
seeking comment on the report.
   A spokesman for Milken said: ``We've never commented and won't
start now on the prejudicial and unfair leaks that have been
printed about this case. Rather than printing the rumor of the day
everyone would be better served by waiting for the facts.''
   The newspaper report said the government offered the plea
bargain after two weeks of negotiations with Milken's lawyers.
   A settlement would erase the need for a long and costly trial on
wide-ranging securities charges, including insider trading, that
could shed new light on one of Wall Street's most powerful figures
of the 1980s. A trial is expected to include testimony by admitted
felon Ivan Boesky, the former stock speculator.
   Reports of a settlement have circulated since Milken first was
linked to the government's insider trading investigation about
three years ago, particularly just before announcements of new
developments.
   The Milken camp has maintained in the past that reports of
developments, including a potential settlement or the contents of a
new indictment, are designed to pressure Milken and others into
cooperating. They have accused the government of deliberately
leaking information and asked a judge to restrain such leaks.
   The latest report said a plea could be complicated because
attorneys for Milken have told the government he is unwilling to
cooperate with the continuing insider trading investigation. Such
cooperation is customary in complicated cases.
   A deal also likely would have to be reached with Milken's
brother, Lowell, who also was indicted, and there is no indication
that one has been proposed or is likely. Michael Armstrong, Lowell
Milken's attorney, did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.

<HEAD>Pan Am Board Meeting Amid Financial Doldrums, Merger Speculation</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp., desperately seeking a merger
partner for more than a year, has had its shares boosted by renewed
speculation of an impending deal to help bail the airline out of
its financial straits.
   Pan Am stock rose 75 cents to $3.75 a share _ a 25 percent surge
_ in heavy trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Market watchers attributed the jump to weekend comments by
William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division.
Genoese said Pan Am management had leaked word that a major
announcement _ probably a deal with Northwest Airlines _ would come
out of its board meeting today.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the airline's
board has a regularly scheduled meeting today, but she declined to
comment on the speculation. Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest
at its headquarters in Eagan, Minn., also declined to comment.
   A combination with a stronger carrier, or a sale of some routes,
could pull Pan Am out of its financial difficulties, analysts said
Monday.
   ``They need to do something,'' said Andrew Geller, an airline
analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   Geller and other analysts cited rumors circulating in financial
quarters that, short of merging with Northwest, Pan Am might strike
a deal to sell some of its prized trans-Atlantic routes or other
assets to the carrier.
   New York-based Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, has
lost nearly $2 billion since 1981 and is saddled with $841 million
in debt.
   Last February, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said the airline
needed to merge with another carrier in order to survive. Pan Am
offered about $3.3 billion last May for NWA Inc., Northwest's
parent, but was outbid by a $3.65 billion offer from a group led by
investor Alfred Checchi.
   Pan Am, with a small domestic route base, has an extensive
network linking New York with major European cities. Northwest, the
nation's fourth-largest carrier, serves more than 100 U.S. cities
but also is strong in the Far East.
   A combination of the two would create the most extensive
international route system of any U.S. carrier.
   ``Pan Am is unlikely to become profitable anytime soon given its
current strategic direction,'' analyst Robert McAdoo of the
investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said in a recent report. He noted
that in recent years Pan Am's New York-Europe routes have been
challenged by competitors offering direct flights to Europe from
newer hubs such as Dallas, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C.
   Despite its problems, McAdoo said, ``Pan Am still has salable
assets to enable it to survive this winter and probably again next
winter.''
   The airline's revenue was hit hard by the explosion of Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, which scared away
many potential trans-Atlantic passengers. But the situation has
improved in recent months, with passenger traffic up 15 percent
last December from a year earlier.
   Pan Am's passenger load factors improved to an average 57.8
percent in November and 62.8 percent in December.
   But fare cuts and increased costs have raised the break-even
level for each flight to around 73 percent of capacity, analysts
estimate.
   Pan Am's cash balance was about $200 million at the end of last
year, Ms. Hanlon said.
   The airline, which was founded in the 1920s by the legendary
Juan Trippe, had become the object of a number of suitors in 1987,
including investors Kirk Kerkorian, Sir James Goldsmith and real
estate developer Donald Trump.
   A proposed takeover by Braniff Inc. collapsed in February 1988
when Braniff failed to win agreements for cost-cutting labor
concessions from Pan Am's pilots union.

<HEAD>Examiner: Eastern Can Fly in Spirit of Compromise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest obstacle to Eastern Airline's
successful climb from bankruptcy is an atmosphere of confrontation
rather than compromise, a court-appointed overseer says.
   ``There's got to be some give and take on both sides,'' David
Shapiro, the carrier's bankruptcy examiner, said Monday.
   ``If the parties put the public interest first and their own
selfish interests second, then Eastern is a viable airline.''
   Shapiro said it is ``totally irresponsible'' to presume
liquidation or sale are the only alternatives for the Miami-based
airline, which he termed ``eminently reorganizable.''
   Shapiro's comments were contained in a statement announcing
court approval of a $105 million program to guarantee that any
passengers and travel agents seeking refunds will be paid.
   Recently, rumors have circulated that Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, Eastern's owner, would opt for a Chapter 7
liquidation.
   Eastern set up the refund program to allay any fears of
liquidation, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
Ticket sales have fallen since the liquidation talk surfaced, the
newspaper reported.
   The ticket refund program approved Monday would cover
ticketholders and travel agents who made purchases after Eastern
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last March 9. Those
who bought tickets issued before the filing remain under bankruptcy
court jurisdiction.
   Meanwhile, Eastern has agreed to hire back 215 union flight
attendants by April 1 as part of an accord in which the union
agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging the jobs of 215 recruits hired
during the strike.
   ``Both sides had to compromise, but this was something we could
live with,'' said Mary Jane Barry, president of Local 553 of the
Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants at
Eastern.
   The union walked out March 4 in sympathy with the Machinists
union, which remains on strike. The flight attendants called off
their strike on Nov. 23.
   Ms. Barry said terms of the agreement with Eastern were
described in a letter sent Friday to the carrier's flight
attendants.
   Also under the agreement:
   _Eastern agreed the union will continue to represent all Eastern
flight attendants and that all future hiring will come from a
seniority list.
   _Eastern will turn over to the union some $340,000 in dues
collected from flight attendants working since the strike began.
   _The union will drop around $215,000 in claims from a
longstanding dispute over pay to union representatives while on
union business.
   Of the 3,600 flight attendants now working for Eastern, about
half were hired after the strike began. The others are veterans who
crossed the picket lines.
   The union and Eastern still must agree on a new contract to
replace the previous one, which expired in 1988.
   Negotiations are continuing with the pilots union, which ended
its sympathy walkout just before the flight attendants.
   Because of Eastern's downsizing as it strives to emerge from
Chapter 11, the number of former strikers who will get their jobs
back is in doubt.
   ``The company blackmailed the flight attendants,'' said Frank
Ortis, president of the Machinists' local. ``There are still 3,000
of them out of work, and it looks like they are pretty well broke.''

<HEAD>SCI Television Avoids Bankruptcy, Restructures Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SCI Television Inc. has completed a debt
exchange offer that will enable the TV station operator to avoid
being forced into bankruptcy court proceedings.
   The Denver-based company, which had been unable to meet interest
payments on its buyout-related debt, has been trying for months to
negotiate an exchange under which its bank and bond lenders would
get an equity stake in the company.
   ``I think the bondholders got a fair deal,'' said Wilbur Ross, a
senior managing director at Rothschild Inc., which was financial
advisor to a group of major SCI bondholders. He spoke Monday as the
debt exchange was being completed.
   The deal reduces the stake held by controlling investor George
Gillett to 41 percent from 55 percent. It also cuts the SCI stake
held by a group led by buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., to 15 percent from 45 percent.
   A key reason why most bondholders accepted the plan was that
Gillett and Kohlberg ``contributed more value to the resolution of
the problem than anybody ever has in resuscitating a failed LBO,''
Ross said.
   In an effort to reduce its debt to manageable proportions, SCI
wanted to get at least 85 percent of $100 million in 16{ percent
senior subordinated debentures tendered under terms of an exchange
offer.
   Those tendering debt would get new debt securities and stock in
the company in return for their bonds.
   Although it failed to come up with the 85 percent goal by a
Monday afternoon deadline, the company said a federal bankruptcy
court judge in Delaware ruled that the difference between the
target and the 83.9 percent the company actually received was ``not
material.''
   As a result, the company said the judge dismissed an involuntary
bankruptcy petition against SCI that had been filed by a small
group of bondholders.
   SCI Television was created in 1987 and consists of the six
television stations once owned by Storer Communications. Kohlberg
Kravis led a leveraged buyout of Storer in 1985 and sold the TV
stations to the new company for $1.3 billion.
   But SCI has had trouble generating enough cash from station
operations to pay the interest on its debt.
   It failed to make a $153 million principal payment on its $650
million in bank debt in October, and subsequently missed an
interest payment on its $507 million in publicly-held bond debt.
   On Oct. 25, SCI announced a restructuring plan under which its
bondholders would exchange their securities for more debt and stock
in the company.
   In mid-November, a group of three SCI Television creditors
unhappy with the plan filed a petition in federal bankrupcty court
in Delaware to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy.
   The petition was filed on behalf of S.N. Phelps &amp; Co. and two
individuals who hold about $180,000 in SCI bonds and were owed
about $15,000 in interest.
   In December, SCI proposed a revised debt restructuring plan
under which Gillett's stake would fall to 41 percent and Kohlberg
Kravis' stake would drop to 15 percent. Bondholders would get a 39
percent stake in the company and bank lenders would get 5 percent.
   In addition to giving up much of its equity in the company, Ross
said Kohlberg Kravis cancelled a $160 million note it was owed.
Kohlberg Kravis and Gillett chipped in another $20 million each by
contributing their interest in a leasing company that owned the
antenna and other equipment used by the SCI stations, Ross said.
   SCI Television operates stations WSBK in Boston, WJBK in
Detroit, WJW in Cleveland, WAGA in Atlanta, KNSD in San Diego and
WITI in Milwaukee.

<HEAD>Simmons Says SEC Probes Timing of His Lockheed, Georgia Gulf
Filings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire investor Harold C. Simmons says
the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into his
acquisitions of Lockheed Corp. and Georgia Gulf Corp. stock, but he
said the probe was routine and wouldn't interfere with his plans.
   Simmons announcement came as Lockheed reported a fourth-quarter
loss of $109 million, and the board of the defense contractor
affirmed the company's rejection of a request by Simmons for a seat
on the board.
   In a filing with the SEC on Monday, Simmons-controlled companies
stated that the probe apparently centered on the timing of their
filing of public disclosure documents regarding acquisition of the
stock.
   But Simmons pooh-poohed it all as a routine investigation with
which he was cooperating.
   Simmons said he expected the government's questions to center on
whether he intended to mount a takeover of Lockheed from the time
he acquired a major interest in the company last April.
   On Monday, Simmons launched a $1.1 billion takeover bid for
Georgia Gulf and said he planned to dump the Atlanta chemical
concern's board.
   On Friday, he said he might seek control of Lockheed's board of
directors after the Calabasas, Calif.-based defense contractor
rebuffed his bid for representation on the board.
   In Monday's public filing, Simmons stated the SEC ``is
conducting a private investigation regarding trading in certain
securities'' of Lockheed and an undisclosed second company.
   Simmons' SEC filing said the agency had issued subpoenas
requesting documents and testimony.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined comment.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in Dallas, Simmons
confirmed that the second company was Georgia Gulf.
   ``I'm primarily the one being investigated,'' Simmons said.
   ``We've always filed those (disclosure documents) promptly and
told exactly what we knew at the time,'' he said. ``We think this
is routine and we think nothing will come of it.''
   According to the filing, the Simmons-controlled companies that
have acquired Lockheed stock _ 18.9 percent as of Friday _ said the
investigation focused primarily on ``the adequacy of disclosures in
statements'' to the SEC and ``the timeliness of such filings.''
   Those filings, SEC forms known as 13-Ds, require an individual
or entity to publicly disclose their stockholdings in a company
with 10 days after those holdings total 5 percent or more of the
company's outstanding shares.
   ``There'll be depositions taken later this week and I think
we'll be able to answer all those questions,'' said Simmons.
   Simmons said sworn statements are to be given by him, by Mike
Snitzer, president of Valhi Inc., Simmons' major holding company,
and by one of Simmons' stock traders.

   Lockheed Corp. reported a fourth-quarter loss
of $109 million as directors of the hard-pressed defense contractor
endorsed a decision rejecting billionaire Harold C. Simmons'
attempt to get a seat on the board.
   The results announced Monday came as little surprise to
analysts, who predicted a large loss back in November after
Lockheed announced it would take a $300 million write-off because
of unexpected design changes on a new Navy plane.
   Lockheed's common stock dropped 75 cents to $38.12{ a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, meaning
that Simmons' paper loss on his 18.9 percent stake in the company
continued to grow.
   The Simmons-controlled investor group NL Industries has bought
stock at prices ranging from about $39 to $48 a share.
   Analyst said they will be watching to see whether the drop in
the stock price increases Simmons' resolve to get more control over
the Calabasas-based military contractor.
   Simmons revealed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings
that he wants representation on the board.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep has opposed such a move, and
the company issued a statement saying its board had endorsed the
rebuff at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday.
   Simmons was not available for comment after business hours.
   ``On paper, this man has lost a great deal of money. I could
understand why he would want more of a say in the company,''
Patricia Trent, an analyst with Seidler Amdec, said of Simmons.
   Lockheed, maker of the radar-evading stealth fighter, reported
Monday that net income for 1989 fell to $2 million, or 3 cents a
share, compared with $624 million, or $10.37 a share, in 1988.
Sales fell to $9.89 billion from $10.43 billion.
   The 1988 results included a $202 million gain on the sale of
Lockheed's DIALOG Information Services unit.
   Earnings for 1989 were pulled down by the fourth-quarter loss of
$109 million, or $1.72 a share, compared with earnings of $104
million, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the latest
quarter rose to $3.03 billion from $2.94 billion a year earlier.
   ``Basically, this is pretty much as telegraphed,'' said Wolfgang
Demisch at UBS Securities in New York.
   Lockheed announced in November that it would take a $300 million
pre-tax write-off because of design changes on the P-7A, a
submarine-hunting airplane.
   Development costs on the plane rose because its design will be
less like that of its predecessor, the P-3C Orion, than expected,
Lockheed said. The company said it still expects to turn a profit
once P-7A production begins.

<HEAD>New Chief at Bank of America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Rosenberg, whose leadership in
California banking helped steer Bank of America from record losses
to record profits in three years, has been named successor to
departing chairman and chief executive A.W. Clausen.
   Clausen, who elevated Rosenberg in 1987 after returning to the
bank's helm to rescue it from financial crisis, announced Monday
that he would retire May 24 as head of the parent company,
BankAmerica Corp.
   ``The job I was called back to do, and which I came back to do,
is done,'' Clausen said in a statement. ``The recovery has been
accomplished. The turnaround has been completed.''
   Reinforcing its turnaround message, BankAmerica also increased
its dividend Monday to 25 cents a share from 15 cents on the
strength of record 1989 earnings.
   The departure by Clausen marks the end of his second tour as
bank boss. He ended a 32-year career at the bank by serving as
president from 1970 to 1981. After a stint as head of the World
Bank in Washington, D.C., he returned in 1986 when BankAmerica was
mired in deep losses and said he would retire as soon as the bank
was strong again.
   Rosenberg, 59, has served as vice chairman of the board of
BankAmerica. The bank said Rosenberg's current postion as head of
California banking would be eliminated.
   The statement described Rosenberg as the architect of the bank's
profit resurgence in retail banking, real estate and commercial
banking in California.
   BankAmerica Corp. last month reported 1989 net earnings of $1.1
billion, or $5.19 a share, the highest in its history. Fourth
quarter 1989 earnings of $270 million represented the 10th
consecutive quarter of higher operating income.
   In contrast, the bank posted losses totalling $1.8 billion from
1985 through 1987 as it struggled with bad loans to developing
countries and troubled domestic real estate loans.
   ``Dick Rosenberg's record as a banker, a manager, and a leader
speaks so strongly for itself that little else needs to be said,''
Clausen said. ``He gives BankAmerica the unique combination of
strength, experience, innovation and inspiration that is critical
to its success in the constantly changing and increasingly
competitive marketplaces of the nineties.''
   Clausen recruited Rosenberg in 1987 from a job as president of
Seafirst Corp., Washington state's largest bank and a wholly owned
subsidiary of BankAmerica.
   Clausen, 66, will remain a board member and serve as chairman of
the executive committee of a new international advisory board.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Oppose Bush on Global Warming Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Senate Governmental Affairs hearing begins 9:30 a.m. EST;

<TEXT>
   President Bush is moving too slowly on the
global warming problem, say environmentalists who contend he
worries too much about industry and not enough about possible
environmental disaster in the next century.
   Bush's speech to an international conference on global warming
Monday included ``more talk ... about economics than the
environment,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, calling the
president's remarks ``a gross disappointment.''
   The administration was likely to get a better reception today
when William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
appeared before a Senate committee to endorse the creation of a
Cabinet-level Department of the Environment.
   While that decision is gaining Bush plaudits among
environmentalists, his remarks on global warming prompted sharp
criticism.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., a frequent critic of the
administration's environmental record, accused the president of
``moving as slow as molasses'' on concerns by many scientists that
man-made pollution accumulating in the atmosphere threatens to
significantly warm the earth by the middle of the next century.
   ``What we're hearing is talk of another year of waiting. I
expected a lot more concern about the (global warming) problem,''
said Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources Institute.
   Bush, speaking to the 60-nation Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, said, ``Our policies must be consistent with
economic growth.'' He complained that in some areas of the debate
over the greenhouse effect, ``politics and opinion have outpaced
the science.''
   ``Our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to
emerging scientific knowledge _ and a reconciling of environmental
protection to the continued benefits of economic development,'' the
president said, promising to convene a White House conference on
global warming in the spring.
   James Tripp, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
Bush failed to demonstrate ``the political will necessary to make
the United States a leader in the effort to prevent global
warming.''
   But Tom Lambrix, head of the Global Climate Coalition, an
industry group, called Bush's view of global warming ``an
appropriate balance.''
   ``We need a better understanding of the economic and social
implications'' of dealing with global warming, said Lambrix,
director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Co.
   The United Nations-sponsored conference of technical experts is
meeting to work on a proposed treaty to deal with global warming.
   Reilly issued a statement saying the president's remarks ``made
clear his determination to lead the world in addressing global
climate change.''
   Bush does not believe it is ``time for a call to arms'' on
global warming, but instead favors continued research, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after the president's
remarks.
   But many environmentalists argue there is enough scientific
evidence to warrant a commitment from the United States and other
industrial nations to reduce global warming gases, especially
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
   Scientists fear such an accumulation of man-made pollutants will
act like a greenhouse, trapping heat and reflecting it back to
earth, causing a warming of the globe. Scientists disagree on how
severe the warming will become or its effect, although some
scientists predict droughts in some interior regions and coastal
flooding because of higher ocean levels.
   Reducing greenhouse gases would require less reliance on coal,
oil and natural gas and would require industry to develop more
energy-efficient automobiles and industrial plants _ which industry
fears could result in widespread economic disruption.

   The dollar fell against other major currencies in
nervous European trading today.
   Gold prices were also lower.
   Dealers said European markets were active following Monday's
dollar sell-off in New York.
   The market sold dollars and bought West Germany marks in
response to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to end
the Communists' monopoly on power in his country.
   The prospect of further democratization in the Soviet Union
fueled expectations that last year's political changes in Eastern
Europe are irreversible and will stimulate West German growth.
   Although the dollar remains highly sensitive to Soviet political
developments, a Milan trader said the currency was close to
bottoming out.
   ``U.S. interest rates are holding steady and I don't see great
possibilities for the dollar to drop much further,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.70 yen to a closing 144.90 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.52 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6591 West German marks, down from 1.6670;
1.4736 Swiss francs, down from 1.4780; 5.6380 French francs, down
from 5.6573; 1.8750 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8880; 1,231.50
Italian lire, down from 1,236.00; and 1.1865 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1891.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7040 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6980 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.20 a troy ounce,
down from $423.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $421.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421.25, down from $423.00 bid late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.61 to close at a bid $419.47.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.33 a troy ounce, down
from Monday's $5.37.

   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today
after a five-day climb, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
inched up.
   The dollar opened and closed at 144.90 yen, down 0.70 yen from
Monday's 145.60-yen finish. In between, it stayed in a narrow range
of 144.80 yen to 145.03 yen.
   The dollar had climbed 2.38 yen in the previous five trading
days.
   Today, ``the dollar-yen trading was very quiet as participants
just made position adjustments around 144.90 yen,'' said a
Mitsubishi Bank trader, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Most Japanese investors were awaiting developments in the Soviet
Communist Party meeting that began Monday, he said.
   Other traders said the dollar's weakness against the yen
reflected concern among investors in New York that the Japanese
might be less active in the U.S. Treasury Department's quarterly
bond auction this week. Reduced Japanese purchases would mean lower
demand for dollars to buy the bonds.
   Stock brokers in Tokyo, however, expected Japanese investors to
pick up 30 to 35 percent of the U.S. government bonds, as they
usually do.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co., said
expectations that Japanese investors might bid more than previously
believed in the bond auction contributed to a rise in the key
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average.
   The index rose 35.42 points, or 0.09 percent, closing at
37,666.83. It had lost 18.74 points the previous day.
   After early gains, the index fell in the afternoon as market
players sold issues for profit-taking, said Hitoshi Nagasawa, an
analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   The yen's strength and overnight gains in overseas stock markets
contributed to the index's early gains, dealers said. Buying also
was encouraged by investors' belief that Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has been handling the Central Committee meeting well.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 530
million shares, up from Monday's 400 million.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the food and liquor giant,
said Tuesday it agreed to sell part of its Wimpy hamburger chain to
a management team led by a former Wimpy managing director.
   The price was not announced, but a source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was about $34 million.
   The sale includes 216 table-service restaurants in Britain and
140 overseas eateries.
   Barry Gibbons, chief executive of Grand Met's Burger King Corp.
unit, said the Wimpy operations being sold don't ``fit our strategy
for the development of the Burger King brand.''
   Grand Met spokesman Bill Bullard described the deal as a
``tidy-up.'' He said the company had decided in September to sell
the table-service Wimpy restaurants and convert the counter-service
shops in Britain to the Burger King brand.
   Grand Met acquired 529 Wimpy restaurants last August from United
Biscuits PLC as part of a $306 million purchase that also included
several pizza restaurants.

<HEAD>3,850 U S West Managers Opt For Early Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An early retirement offer extended by U S West
Inc. has been accepted by some 3,850 managers and the final tally
is expected to hit 4,000, says Dick McCormick, company president.
   ``This action balances the company's need to reduce its costs
with our commitment to treat these valued employees fairly,''
McCormick said Monday.
   U S West gave the managers a Jan. 31 deadline to apprise the
company of their plans, but several hundred employees were given
extensions for varying reasons.
   By noon Monday, the company had received about 5,700 responses,
with slightly more than two-thirds opting for early retirement,
said spokesman Dick MacKnight.
   As of Sept. 30, U S West and its subsidiaries had 23,651
managers, 21,735 of them in companies participating in the early
retirement plan. Those who opted to stay face the possibility of a
layoff.
   ``We're going to size this organization appropriately for the
market demand,'' said Steve Lang, another U S West spokesman.
``That means we're constantly looking ... and making adjustments.''
   Trimming management positions could be part of that adjustment.
   An in-house announcement of the early retirement program said
there probably will be management layoffs in 1990 and that
``involuntary separations'' lay ahead.
   U S West Communications, U S West Inc.'s largest subsidiary, is
conducting the study that will determine where a surplus of
management exists.
   Since American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's court ordered divestiture
in 1984, U S West has increased its management staff by nearly
4,000, partly through the acquisition and creation of subsidiaries
as well as a loose classification of management jobs.
   The early retirements should fuel cost savings in the company's
telecommunications business, McCormick said in a news release.
   The company reported a 2.4 percent decline in earnings per share
from 1988 to 1989. The early retirements are expected to help U S
West achieve earning goals in 1990 and beyond, he said.
   ``We plan to invest a significant portion of the savings in long
term projects that will allow us to serve our customers even
better,'' he said.

   Automakers pared their new-car inventories
sharply last month by cutting production and offering incentives,
giving them room to boost manufacturing schedules somewhat to
prepare for spring.
   The eight major U.S. automakers on Monday reported a 1.5 percent
decline in car and truck sales during late January. A 6.6 percent
drop in car sales during Jan. 21-31 was offset largely by an 8.1
percent increase in light truck sales.
   Analysts said the figures were better than they appeared because
sales in the year-earlier period were inflated by a special factor.
   During all of January, when General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp. shut down assembly and supplier plants for at
least a week at a time, combined car and truck sales by the eight
domestic makers were up 6.2 percent from January 1989.
   Sales of imported cars and trucks fell 6.1 percent in January.
   ``It looks like we just went from 97 days worth of supply on
December 31 to about 65 at the end of January,'' said analyst
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York City. ``Sales have
run 80 percent ahead of production.
   ``That's something I've never seen before in a January period,''
he added.
   Automakers usually let inventories build a little in February as
they prepare for what usually is an increased buying pace in March
and April.
   ``The key now is how you manage it,'' Brady said. ``You nudge up
production and nudge back incentives and find a happy medium.''
   Many of the Big Three plants that were shut down in January are
returning to production this month.
   But in March, GM and Chrysler will make some permanent cuts by
slowing line speeds, eliminating shifts or, in the case of GM's
Atlanta assembly plant, shutting down an entire factory
indefinitely. All told, the two companies have announced indefinite
layoffs that will idle about 15,400 workers at 11 plants between
January and September.
   Incentives last month appeared to be most effective in boosting
truck sales, especially Chrysler minivans. The nation's No. 3
automaker on Dec. 15 offered cash rebates and low-interest
financing for the first time on its Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager
and Chrysler Town and Country minivans.
   The incentives on the minivans ended last Wednesday, but
Chrysler has continued the offers on other cars and trucks.
   Results in late January 1989 were inflated somewhat by heavy
fleet sales, a condition analysts said made this year's late
January figures look relatively encouraging.
   Typically, a large percentage of January and February car sales
go to fleets, including auto rental companies and large
corporations. But this year, because of severe cuts in production
last month, fleet deliveries were put off.
   ``January a year ago was an especially strong fleet sales month
for Ford,'' said Robert Rewey, vice president for Ford Motor Co.'s
North American Automotive Operations. ``Due to downtime at a number
of our plants in the early part of this January, assembly and
shipment of many fleet units was delayed.''
   Chrysler said its late-January truck sales rose 42.7 percent
from sales during the same time last year. For all of January,
Chrysler's truck sales were up 39.7 percent from January 1989.
   GM's truck sales rose 6.8 percent in late January and 11.8
percent for the whole month. Ford said its truck sales fell 8.2
percent during the period and 1 percent for the month.

   The stock market pulled back today, following
two consecutive advances.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose nearly 20
points on Monday, was down 9.23 at 2,613.29 after 30 minutes of
trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 5 to 3 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 322 up, 543 down
and 555 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.91 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 17.6 million shares at the same point
in Monday's session.
   Stock prices have risen in three of the past four sessions after
sinking for most of the month of January.
   But the prospect of rising interest rates has limited the price
gains, making yields on short-term Treasury securities more
competitive with those available in the stock market.
   The financial community has been focused in recent days on the
Treasury's impending auction of $30 billion in new securities. That
auction begins later today with the sale of $10 billion in
three-year notes.
   The three-year note sale will be followed by a $10 billion
auction of 10-year notes on Wednesday and the sale of $10 billion
in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   Rates have risen over the past few days as many dealers feel
that higher rates are needed to make sure that foreign investors,
particularly the Japanese, buy a sizeable portion of the new
issues. Rates have risen in Japan in recent weeks, making them more
competitive with those available in the U.S.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Pan Am was up &lsqb; at
3~, Bank of New England was up &lsqb; at 5~ and IBM was up { at 100&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.54 at 182.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 0.24 at 354.46.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.82 points to
2,622.52.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 838 up, 646 down and
490 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 130.95 million shares, against 164.40
million in the previous session. That was the lowest since 128.03
million shares changed hands on Dec. 28, 1989.

<TEXT>
   Georgia Gulf Corp., facing a $1.1 billion bid
from Texas investor Harold Simmons, said today its board is
considering the offer and will recommend by the end of the week
whether shareholders should accept or reject the proposal.
   NL Industries Inc., a chemical supply company controlled by
Simmons, began a $45 a share tender offer today for the 91 percent
of Georgia Gulf it does not already own.
   NL said Monday it was also planning a proxy fight aimed at
replacing the Atlanta chemical maker's board of directors with a
slate of candidates more sympathetic to NL's position.
   Georgia Gulf Chairman James R. Kuse said in a letter to
shareholders today the company's board and legal advisers were
considering Simmons' bid.
   ``The board of directors encourages you to defer your decision
whether to accept or reject NL Industries' offer until you have had
the benefit of and reflected on the company's recommendation,''
Kuse said.
   Simmons has been eyeing Georgia Gulf since last summer, but the
Atlanta company in January launched a recapitalization plan
apparently designed to fend off Simmons. The value of that plan has
been estimated by Georgia Gulf at about $55 a share.
   Houston-based NL, announcing its tender offer last week, said it
was pursuing the acquisition because company officials believed the
recapitalization, under current market conditions, would yield less
than $45 a share.

   The Bush administration today sent Congress a
package of recommendations for new farm legislation but did not
spell out how commodity programs should be reduced in order to meet
federal spending cutbacks next year.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told a news conference the
proposals dealt only with farm policy and did not address budget
problems.
   He said if all the proposals were approved, they would have
``nominal impact'' on consumer food prices.
   One of the most controversial items facing the administration is
how to cut fiscal 1991 commodity spending by $1.5 billion, a level
included in the budget proposals President Bush sent to Congress
last week.
   However the budget message said only that the White House ``is
prepared to work closely'' with lawmakers on the $1.5 billion
reduction in commodity programs.
   Yeutter said administration policy-makers ``do not intend to
make specific recommendations'' on how to cut programs by $1.5
billion but will work that out with Congress when the time comes.
He is scheduled to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee
on Wednesday.
   Between 60 and 70 specific recommendations were submitted to
Congress, about 90 percent of which will require legislation, he
said.
   Yeutter said the administration's plan calls for greater
production flexibility and decision-making by farmers, allowing
them greater choice on crops to grow under annual commodity
programs.
   The package also included a recommendation for eliminating the
department's Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides
subsidized all-risk coverage to farmers, and replacing it with
permanent disaster assistance.
   But Yeutter said the administration would listen to Congress in
case there an alternate solution is sought.
   Another major question is what to do with the department's
Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides subsidized all-risk
coverage to farmers.
   The agency has been losing money for many years, with many
farmers spurning the insurance and relying on Congress to bail them
out with emergency legislation in case of drought, floods and other
disasters.
   Yeutter says farmers can't have it both ways and that one or the
other of the programs _ insurance or emergency aid _ has to go. The
Bush budget recommended scrapping the insurance program in the 1991
fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1.
   The administration decided some time ago not to send a formally
drafted farm bill to Capitol Hill to succeed the 1985 law that will
expire at the end of the 1990 crop season. Instead, a series
``concept papers'' or guidelines has been prepared.
   Yeutter and others have lauded the Food Security Act of 1985,
the current farm law, for helping make U.S. commodities more
competitive in world trade, thus enhancing the nation's export
position.
   The 1985 law has helped with its authority for lowering federal
price supports and target-price benefits due farmers. The Bush
budget said there could be substantial savings if these declines
``were continued or even accelerated'' by the 1990 farm bill.
   ``We must make certain that our commodity programs have enough
flexibility to allow farmers to grow crops that consumers want,
instead of crops that the government dictates,'' Yeutter said
Monday.
   ``This, in concert with a stronger U.S. trading stance in world
markets for agricultural commodities and products, will go a long
way toward keeping the agrarian economy robust,'' he told the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. in Orlando, Fla.
   Most major farm organizations have already taken stands on some
of the major issues involved in 1990 farm legislation.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, for example, has been a
strong supporter of the 1985 law's emphasis on greater market
orientation by setting price supports in line with domestic and
global competition.
   A federation position paper distributed Monday called for
maintaining ``the general direction'' set by the 1985 farm law. It
also urged greater acreage flexibility under federal commodity
programs.
   The federation said price support loan rates, which act as a
market floor for major crops such as wheat and feed grains, should
continue to be tied to a percentage of the average price of the
commodity over the past several years.
   But the federation said target prices used to compute
``deficiency payments'' to farmers when markets falter should be
frozen at 1990 levels.
   ``Additional reductions would result in an unacceptable lowering
of farm income,'' the federation said.
   The National Farmers Union says the 1990 farm bill should
provide government muscle to ``sustain family-size farm operation;
promote environmentally safe stewardship of the land; provide
nutrition assistance for low-income citizens; and enhance the
viability of rural communities.''
   Generally, the NFU favors supply management concepts, not the
looser ``market-oriented'' themes sought by the administration and
the Farm Bureau.
   For example, the NFU's own farm bill would tie the target price
of wheat to ``the full cost of production, plus a reasonable rate
of return, on a commodity base which will sustain a family-sized
unit.''

   Lotus Development Corp. went to federal court
today to prove that two competitors copied its popular business
spreadsheet program in a suit that could clarify copywrite laws for
computer software.
   Lotus, which says its lawsuit aims to protect computer
innovations, began the case by demonstrating its Lotus 1-2-3
program to the court.
   Using video screens, the company showed the basic steps for
setting up financial statements, graphs and mortgage projections by
inserting numbers into various columns and rows.
   Lotus filed suit in 1987 against Paperback Software
International of Berkeley, Calif., and Mosaic Software of
Cambridge, claiming a copyright infringement of the ``look and
feel'' of Lotus' popular 1-2-3 program.
   The case centers on what protection should be given to images
that appear on a computer screen and the commands associated with
the program _ known as the ``user interface.''
   ``A lot of people are looking at the case to make a decision on
the issue,'' said Ned Saltzberg, a Boston lawyer and editor of the
Computer Law Newsletter.
   Legal experts say the inner workings of the program are
protected by copyright laws, but Lotus argues that the computer
screen display constitutes an expression of an idea and thus falls
under copyright protection.
   ``Lotus is alleging these companies copied keystroke for
keystroke the spreadsheet modules for 1-2-3,'' said Bryan Simmons,
a spokesman for the Cambridge-based company.
   The 1-2-3 menus provide users with options such as ``file,''
``print,'' ``copy,'' and ``combine,'' and keyboard buttons are
punched to activate those options.
   Paul Gupta, a lawyer representing Paperback Software, said
``what appears on a menu does not constitute expression. Where
you've got a simple list of words on a screen, it's not enough to
call it copyrightable.''
   Gupta said Paperback Software, to some extent, had its hands
tied in the development of its VP-Planner spreadsheet program. In
order to make a product that is compatible with Lotus 1-2-3, the
company had to use technologies that result in similar computer
images and commands, he said.
   ``Where we had the opportunity to make changes, we did,'' he
said.
   In fact, Paperback Software says by building on Lotus' system,
the company was following a pattern in the computer industry, in
which borrowed ideas have led to innovations.
   Adam Osborne, president of the company, noted that Lotus modeled
1-2-3 after a previous program, VisiCalc, and he said his firm has
made further improvements.
   ``They had to hobble us with legal processes,'' he said.
   Officials at Mosaic Software were not available for comment
Monday.
   But Simmons, at Lotus, said a ruling in his company's favor
would not stifle innovation, but would do the opposite.
   Without the copyright protection, an entrepreneur might not
experiment with new products for fear that a big company will
swallow up the idea, he said.
   ``Lotus believes this will encourage innovators to take risks,''
Simmons said.
   Also, he said, companies can use the idea of a business
spreadsheet, but do not need to copy each other's material in order
to compete. Other spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, are ``very
different from our product,'' he said.
   ``It comes down to, `Are you building on an idea or building on
an expression of an idea?''' he said.
   Lee Gesmer, a partner with the Boston law firm of Lucash, Gesmer
&amp; Updegrove, which publishes the Technology Law Bulletin, said he
expects Lotus to win the case, based on recent similar decisions.
   But perhaps more importantly, Saltzberg said the case should
give software designers a better idea of what is and isn't
permissible.
   ``As long as the rules are clear, people can abide by them,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with technical
weakness offset by signs of strengthening foreign demand.
   Wheat futures were slightly lower, corn was a little higher and
soybeans were narrowly mixed.
   The technical sell signals included Monday's lower close.
Analysts said the markets could test recent lows today.
   But several weeks of falling prices have caught the attention of
foreign buyers, and prospects for export business are improving,
said William Biedermann, director of research for the futures
brokerage Allendale Inc.
   The Agriculture Department on Monday approved a sale of 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices, and a
number of other countries _ including El Salvador, Pakistan,
Zambia, Iraq and Taiwan _ are in the market for U.S. grains and
soybean products, he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1\ cents to 1} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $3.81} a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.37 a
bushel; oat futures were uncanged to { cent lower with March at

   Cattle futures advanced while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .25 cent higher with February at
79.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher
with March at 83.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to
.02 cent higher with February at 48.85 cents a pound; frozen pork

   Kroger Co. on Tuesday said it lost $45.9
million in the fourth quarter due to an extraordinary loss of $51.3
million from writing off debt incurred in its 1988 restructuring.
   The fourth-quarter loss, which came to 56 cents a share,
compared to a loss of $119 million, or $1.57 a share, in the final
three months of 1988 when a $128.7 million after-tax restructuring
charge was taken.
   The supermarket and convenience store company said that
excluding the extraordinary loss it earned $5.3 million, or 7 cents
a share, in the three months ended Dec. 30.
   Sales edged about 0.1 percent higher to $4.653 billion in the
fourth quarter from $4.648 billion in 1988's fourth quarter. But
not counting sales at stores divested since the fourth quarter of
1988, total sales were up 8.3 percent.
   Kroger in 1988 carried out a $4.6 billion restructuring to fight
off takeover attempts.
   Joseph Pichler, Kroger's president and chief operating officer,
said ``The continuing units of Kroger are managing expenses and
cash flow with great dedication, and this is showing in our
results,''
   For all of last year, Kroger said it lost $72.7 million, or 92
cents a share, compared to $34.5 million, or 24 cents a share, in
1988.
   Before a$56.5 million extraordinary loss from early payment of
debt and the write-off of deferred costs associated with 1988's
restructuring, Kroger's 1989 loss was $16.25 million, or 23 cents a
share.
   Sales for the year were $19.1 billion, compared with $19 billion
in 1988. Kroger said its proceeds from divestitures and improved
operating results were better than anticipated and allowed the
company to reduce its outstanding debt and retire its preferred
stock for a total of $372 million, including $125 million of
scheduled payments.
   A new credit agreement negotiated during the last quarter gave
Kroger more favorable credit terms and replaced portions of its
debt with lower interest, longer term debt, the company said.
   ``Kroger maintained its strong market position and responded to
the needs of our customers, and in doing so we were able to set the
stage for continued growth in 1990 and beyond,'' said Lyle
Everingham, Kroger's chairman and chief executive.
   The company owns and operates supermarkets, convenience stores
and food processing plants in 32 states, mostly in the Midwest and
South.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virgin Atlantic Airways announced Tuesday it is
introducing completely non-smoking flights between New York and
London starting May 18.
   Virgin, owned by British entrepreneur Richard Branson, said it
is the first airline to offer such service between the two cities.
The airline said increasing passenger demand for smoke-free flights
prompted the move.
   Other trans-Atlantic carriers are also considering non-smoking
flights.
   Congress passed a bill last November banning smoking on
virtually all U.S. domestic flights effective Feb. 25.
International flights, however, usually offer smoking sections.
   ``This is the first clear alternative to non-smoking sections,
which are never completely satisfactory for today's
health-conscious traveler,'' Virgin said in a statement.
   The airline said it will introduce a second flight between
Newark, N.J., and Gatwick Airport outside London on Thursdays,
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays to accommodate the new non-smoking
service. Virgin will continue to offer smoking and non-smoking
sections on its other daily flights to London out of Newark and
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
   London-based Virgin said it hoped to extend the non-smoking
service later to its flights to and from Tokyo, Los Angeles, Miami
and Kennedy Airport if the idea is well received by passengers.

<HEAD>Yes, You Can Afford A House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes you have to watch what you say,
because people might take you too seriously.
   For several years the National Association of Realtors has
promoted the idea _ particularly through its so-called
affordability index _ that houses are unaffordable for a large
percentage of potential buyers.
   The index is a product of five financial elements involved in
owning a house, the most important of them being median household
income, the median price of the ``typical'' single-family home and
the level of interest rates.
   If prices and interest rates rise while income remains the same
or falls, or even if income rises but not sufficiently to offset
increases in other factors, affordability is said to fall.
   In December, for instance, the index measured 108.2, up from
105.5 in November, boosted to that level mainly by declines in
mortgage rates. Since then, rates have risen. January's index seems
destined to fall.
   It's the declines that create the problems, because they suggest
that good, sound American families are being denied the right to
live as good, average American families. The issue is almost a
sacred one.
   Never mind that at 108.2, the December index meant a family
earning the national median of $33,600 had 108.2 percent of income
needed to qualify for a conventional mortgage of 80 percent on a
home priced at $92,500.
   Many housing people find the measure useful as a trend
indicator. But many buyers and sellers, even realtors, and
sometimes the media make a different interpretation. They stress
the UNaffordability aspect of the index.
   The index does suggest, for example, that while your family
might be close to typical in income, you still might not be able to
afford a typical house if local prices are higher than the national
median.
   It also says that millions of other American households cannot
qualify for the typically priced house, because 50 percent of them
don't earn as much as the median income. When the index falls, that
aspect is heavily stressed.
   In the past, in fact, it was stressed very heavily by the
realtors, especially when issues affecting housing were discussed
in Washington, and particularly when the index dropped below 100,
as in 1983 and 1984.
   At times, the unaffordability of housing was promoted by various
housing and real estate groups as a national disgrace, as something
that demanded immediate correction, perhaps through the tax system.
   Other groups have since picked up the cry and the issue of
``affordable housing'' is a huge one now, and generally the stress
is on the lack of affordable housing. It is a widespread
perception, often accepted uncritically.
   Many Americans who otherwise feel typical now are convinced
housing is beyond their financial reach. Some have become market
dropouts, ignoring the fact that thousands of houses are available
for under the typical price.
   In response, a grass roots campaign has begun in the Northeast,
where prices are relatively high and the unaffordability attitude
is entrenched. It's called, `Yes You Can,'' meaning, yes, you can
buy a home.
   It seems destined to spread. It originated in Springfield, Mass.
in 1982, when high interest rates undermined the market. Big
inventories convinced The Greater Springfield Association of
Realtors to resurrect the campaign in 1989.
   Iy has now been adopted in New Jersey, where the state
association says it plans to spend $250,000 in the media and on
billboards to promote its own campaign, ``Yes, You Can Buy a House
in New Jersey.''
   In the realtors' national trade paper, ``Realtor News,'' which
carries the index, a member states that the industry has to change
consumer perceptions about unaffordability.
   The member explained that ``many are not hearing from the press
that affordable homes and financing are available.''

<HEAD>United Telecom Says US Sprint Continues To Grow, But Profit Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Telecommunications Inc. said
Tuesday its profit declined sharply during 1988's fourth quarter,
but that its revenue jumped 15 percent, thanks mostly to continued
growth at its US Sprint long-distance phone company.
   Profit was hurt by the comparison with a strong 1988 fourth
quarter, when United Telecom reported an after-tax gain of $369
million from the sale of its cellular phone and paging operations.
   But profit from continuing operations grew, the company said, to
$101.4 million from $10.7 million during the fourth quarter of 1988.
   United Telecom had net profit of $101.4 million, or 48 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $379.5 million, or
$1.85 a share, during the same period of 1988.
   Revenue for the quarter jumped to $2 billion, compared with $1.7
billion during the same period a year earlier.
   For all of 1989, profit fell to $363 million, down from $509
million in 1988, also because of the sale of the cellular and
paging units, the company said.
   For the year, overall revenue jumped to $7.5 billion, from $6.5
billion in 1988.
   U.S. Sprint Communications Co., the nation's third-largest
long-distance company with about 8 percent of the domestic market,
reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.2 billion, 28 percent more
than the $930 million reported in the fourth quarter of 1988. It
was the company's third straight quarter of billion-dollar sales.
   Sprint's fourth-quarter operating income jumped to $81 million,
compared with an operating loss of $176 million in 1988's fourth
quarter.
   For the year, Sprint had operating income of $227 million,
compared with a 1988 operating loss of $386 million. Operating
revenue for 1989 totaled $4.3 billion, up 27 percent from 1988's
$3.4 billion.
   ``We have every reason to believe the progress in our 1989
performance will continue into 1990,'' said William T. Esrey,
president and chief executive officer of United Telecom.
   He noted that Sprint's fourth-quarter revenue reflected only
minimal impact from a contract the company won last year to provide
40 percent of a new telephone system for the federal government.
Esrey has said that the federal government soon will be Sprint's
largest customer.
   In addition to its 80 percent ownership of Sprint, Kansas
City-based United Telecom owns companies that provide local phone
service in the South and Midwest. The rest of Sprint is owned by
GTE Corp.

<HEAD>Romania Devalues Currency For Foreign Transactions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interim government on Tuesday
announced a sharp devaluation of the lei and set a single exchange
rate aimed at better reflecting the currency's real value and
helping repair decades of chaotic monetary policies.
   The devaluation also was aimed at spurring exports by making
Romanian products relatively cheaper in foreign markets.
   The ruling Executive Bureau of the National Salvation Front set
new exchange rates against hard currencies, pegged to a dollar rate
of 21 lei.
   The previous rates were 8.74 lei to the dollar for
non-commercial transactions and 14.23 lei for commercial
transactions.
   However, the official rate remains below black market dollar
rates now averaging about 80 lei.
   The currency decree dated Feb. 1 was not published until
Tuesday, when the new list of exchange rates appeared in the
newspaper Romania Libera. The decree said it was aimed at
rectifying an ``abnormal situation,'' and making the lei's value
more realistic.
   The devaluation was announced less than 24 hours after the
Executive Bureau, which has been running the country since dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled Dec. 22, issued another decree
legalizing free enterprise on a much larger scale than existed
during 45 years of Communist rule.
   The decree, the most far-reaching consumer-oriented measure
since December's revolution, will allow the existence of
profit-making businesses with up to 20 employees. Under the old
system, tradesmen could employ only up to three people and taxes
were punitive.
   Under Ceausescu, the dollar-lei exchange rate was set
artificially high in favor of the lei, in an apparent attempt to
have it reflect what the dictator touted as Romania's economic
strength.
   The single exchange rate that will replace the previous multiple
lei rates will be set weekly by the National Bank of Romania to
reflect the dollar's value on international markets.
   The lei rate for other hard currencies will be determined by
their rate in relation to the dollar. For example, the West German
mark's rate has increased from 5.17 lei at the end of January to
12.50 lei starting Feb. 1, as that currency has strengthened
against the dollar.
   The new decree does not apply to Soviet rubles or other
non-freely convertible currencies from countries that have
established bilateral or multilateral agreements with fixed lei
rates.
   The new rates are expected to stimulate exports, but imports
will be more expensive in lei so the government has created a
special fund to meet the increased cost, the newspaper said.
   ``What is important is that internal prices for consumer goods
will not be changed. Tourism is thus stimulated,'' the paper said.

   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies in European trading Tuesday, depressed by broad interest
in the West German mark and worries about the U.S. Treasury's
quarterly financing operation this week.
   Gold was lower.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.6570 Deutsche marks Tuesday
afternoon, down from 1.6670 late Monday in London.
   Dealers said confidence in the dollar has been shaken by
uncertainty over Japanese interest in sales of 10-year and 30-year
Treasury securities on Wednesday and Thursday.
   However, they said the primary action in the market has been a
broad return to marks after a bout of short-dollar covering against
the West German currency.
   ``There was a bit of a short squeeze'' on the dollar, said John
Wastell, a corporate dealer at Bank of America in London. ``But we
expect the dollar to stay under pressure. The covering has cleared
room for fresh selling'' against the mark.
   Wastell said interest in buying marks against the yen is
underpinned to some degree by technical factors, including the
mark's move through 87.15 yen early in the day. In late London
dealings, the cross-rate was around 87.56 yen with some dealers
predicting a move toward 87.80 yen before some profit taking might
surface.
   While the dollar weakened against the yen, dealers anticipate
the U.S. currency will remain firm in the run-up to Japanese
national elections on Feb. 18.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.70 yen to close at 144.90 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 145.10 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels were: 1.4770 Swiss francs, down from 1.4780; 5.6405 French
francs, down from 5.6573; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8880;
1,235.00 Italian lire, down from 1,236.00; and 1.1874 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1891.
   The British pound rose to $1.7015 from $1.6980 late Monday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $420.85 a troy
ounce, down from $432.25 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold closed at $420.75, down from $423 bid late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.61 to close at a bid $419.47.
   Silver bullion traded at a late bid price of $5.31 a troy ounce
Tuesday, down from $5.37 bid late Monday.

   Stocks finished sharply lower in London Tuesday,
as an early drop on Wall Street sent British shares spiraling
downwards.
   Prices in New York fell broadly lower in the first hour of
trading, as the market took its cues from weakness in the bond
market ahead of Tuesday's first phase of the U.S. Treasury bond
auctions.
   By the close of the European business day, the Dow Jones
industrial average had slumped 26.57 points to 2,595.95. A round of
futures-related sell programs contributed to New York's retreat,
taking London equities with it, traders said.
   ``There have been too many downgradings, there's too much stock
around and nobody wants to buy this market,'' said a dealer at a
major U.S. brokerage firm in London.
   Dealers said selling spanned the entire spectrum of stocks.
   By the end of the session, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-stock index was 27.3 points, or 1.2 percent, lower at 2,321.1
after having reached 2,345.4 earlier in the day.
   Volume came to a light 406.9 million shares, compared with 378.9
million shares Monday.

   Stock prices drifted at broadly lower levels
this afternoon, weighed down by concerns about rising interest
rates.
   Trading activity was moderate, picking up the pace from Monday
which was the slowest trading day of the new year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 19.82 points
on Monday and 36.26 over the past two sessions, was down 25.00 at
2,597.52 with two hours left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 2 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 446 up, 960 down
and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 96.50 million shares at 2 p.m.
EST compared with 87.48 million shares at the same point Monday.
   Stock prices have risen in three of the past four sessions after
sinking for most of the month of January.
   But the prospect of rising interest rates has limited the price
gains, making yields on short-term Treasury securities more
competitive with those available on stocks and dimming chances for
corporate earnings growth.
   In the credit markets today, rates edged up on six-month
Treasury bills while yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the
8.56 percent level from 8.53 percent late Monday.
   The financial community has been focused in recent days on the
Treasury's impending auction of $30 billion in new securities.
   The results of the first part of the auction are expected to be
announced later today with the sale of $10 billion in three-year
notes. That will be followed by a $10 billion auction of 10-year
notes on Wednesday and the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds on
Thursday.

<HEAD>OPEC Production Lower in January; Still Above Output Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC slashed oil production last month
but not enough to meet its promised goal, according to estimates
released Tuesday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that the 13 OPEC nations produced about 23.3 million barrels
of crude oil a day in January. That was about 00,000 barrels below
December's peak levels but still well above the 22-million-barrel
limit OPEC pledged late last year.
   The bulk of the reduction occurred in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates, the report said.
   The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries pledged last November to cut daily production to 22
million barrels for the first half of 1990. Although the ceiling
was 20.5 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989, actual
production had reached 24 million barrels a day in December boosted
by excess flow from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Analysts had expected the producing nations to rein in
production even more in January to try to meet the new production
cap.
   Nonetheless, the continued brisk flow has not depressed prices
as some had predicted. World oil prices, in fact, soared early in
January although they have eased slightly since then.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was
$19.56 a barrel in the last week of January, down from $20.46 in
the first week of the month. OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel.
   On the futures market, West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, has been trading in the range of $22 to $23 a barrel,
higher than the $20 to $21 range in December.
   ``Although OPEC's crude oil output in January has been well
above the expectations based on the new production ceilings set by
OPEC, the oil market has not yet shown any significant indications
of oversupply,'' said the energy agency report.
   Analysts suggested OPEC production might even increase.
   Nick Antill, analyst at the London firm of County NatWest, said
he had a ``strong suspicion'' that this month's output would show
``little change'' from January. He said there has been ``no serious
effort to cut'' back on production.
   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based newsletter
Petrostrategies, predicted production would be higher in February.
``It is increasing ... That is undeniable,'' he said.
   Some analysts believe key producing countries want to keep
prices around the $18 mark partly to discourage non-OPEC countries
from muscling in on their share of the world oil market. Higher
prices could attract more producers. Lower production would likely
drive up prices, some argue, given the strong demand. Conversely,
strong production would tend to weaken them.
   The energy agency estimated demand for OPEC oil would shrink
from an estimated 22.7 million barrels a day in the first quarter
of this year to 19.8 million barrels in the second three months.
   Total world demand was estimated at 53.9 million barrels a day
in the January-March period and 51 million barrels in the
April-June period.
   The report estimated production by Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest crude oil exporter, at 5.3 million barrels a day last
month, in line with its individual output quota for the first half
of the year.
   Production by the United Arab Emirates was estimated at 2
million barrels a day in January, over its cap of 1.1 million
barrels. Kuwait's output was recorded at 1.7 million barrels, above
its limit of 1.5 million barrels. In December, output was put at
2.3 million barrels for the UAE and 2 million barrels for Kuwait.
   The agency set Iran's supply at 2.9 million barrels a day in
January and Iraq's at 3.1 million barrels a day. Each has a quota
of 3.1 million barrels.
   Other estimates for January production were: Qatar, 400,000
barrels a day; Nigeria, 1.8 million barrels; Libya, 1.2 million
barrels; Algeria, 800,000 barrels; Gabon, 200,000 barrels;
Venezuela, 1.9 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; and
Indonesia, 1.3 million barrels.
   The International Energy Agency is an arm of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of 24 Western
nations.

Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post Co. said Tuesday its
fourth-quarter profit climbed 38.4 percent from a year ago, while
its earnings for the year dropped 26.5 percent.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Washington Post said it
earned $51.1 million, or $4.06 a share, compared with $36.9
million, or $2.87 a share, a year ago.
   The increase in the latest quarter would have been only 3
percent if restructuring charges at Newsweek magazine were excluded
from the 1988 results.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 2.9 percent to $381.4 million from
$370.8 million in 1988.
   For the year, the company said it earned $197.9 million, or
$15.50 a share, compared with $269.1 million, or $20.91 a share, a
year ago.
   Included in the 1988 earnings was a non-recurring gain of $103.1
million after taxes from the sale of the company's interests in
cellular telephone operations, partially offset by restructuring
charges at Newsweek magazine. Excluding the non-recurring items,
net income increased by 19 percent and earnings per share jumped 20
per share in 1989.
   Revenue for 1989 totaled $1.44 billion, up 5.6 percent from
$1.37 billion in 1988.
   Operating income from the newspaper division increased 25.5
percent to $176.6 million from 1988 levels, while the broadcast
division was up 11.9 percent at $72.1 million and the cable
division rose 27.6 percent to $26.1 million from the previous year.
   Operating income at Newsweek rose 40 percent to $28.2 million
for the year from $20.1 million before restructuiring charges in
1988.
   Advertising volume at The Washington Post newspaper rose 1.1
percent for the year while ad revenue rose 7.4 percent.
   The Washington Post Co. also owns The Herald in Everett, Wash.,
four television stations and about 50 cable TV systems.

cream maker in 1982 as the company's first general manager after
owning and operating Hunt's, a Burlington nightclub.
   ``I've been contemplating this move for some time,'' he said.
``I'm looking forward to taking some time off and working for a
while at a more relaxed pace.''
   Lager said he may pursue writing or teaching. ``I wouldn't rule
out running another small business in the future, but I'm in no
rush to get involved in another totally engrossing project.'' He'll
also remain on the Ben &amp; Jerry's board and work as a consultant to
the company.
   Cohen praised Lager's ``managerial expertise and leadership that
allowed us to grow successfully at an incredible rate.'' Sales have
increased from less than $1 million in 1982, when Lager joined the
company, to more than $50 million now, Cohen said.
   Lacey, a 1980 Amherst College graduate with a master's degree
from the Cornell University business school, joined the company in
1989 after working for an upstate New York hospital chain.

<HEAD>BAT To Open Bidding For Field's and Saks Retail Chains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proud and vital chunk of Chicago history goes
on the auction block this week as BAT Industries PLC opens the
bidding for the Marshall Field and Co. department store chain.
   At least half a dozen parties, including Field's management, are
expected to join the bidding for the 135-year-old retailer, which
has 24 stores in four states.
   The process begins Thursday when the investment firm Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. hands out confidential prospectuses to potential
bidders for both Field's and the larger Saks Fifth Avenue chain,
according to a spokeswoman for Batus Inc., a subsidiary of BAT
based in Louisville, Ky.
   London-based BAT hopes to announce the winning bids sometime in
May, the spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Observers have estimated Marshall Field will fetch $600 million
to $1 billion, while some analysts have estimated that Saks could
fetch upwards of $1.2 billion.
   BAT shareholders in October approved a plan to sell the
company's U.S. retailing operations in a restructuring designed to
thwart a $21.7 billion hostile takeover bid led by Anglo-French
financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT has owned Field's since 1982.
   Ironically, one of Goldsmith's backers is Frederick W. Field, a
descendant of Field's founder.
   Field's Chairman Philip B. Miller and May Department Stores Co.
have said publicly they want to buy Field's. Others reportedly
interested in the chain include Dillard Department Stores Inc.,
Dayton Hudson Corp., JMB Realty Corp. and several U.S. investment
firms representing foreign interests.
   The winner will get a thriving, determinedly upscale chain that
commands 15 percent of the crowded Chicago retail market despite
stiff competition from Bloomingdale's, Nieman-Marcus, Saks and
others.
   Miller moved to Field's from the president's office of
Nieman-Marcus in 1983. He engineered a financial turnaround at
Field's, overseen an extensive remodeling of the company's flagship
store on State Street and expanded its reach into Ohio and Texas.
The company also has stores in Wisconsin.
   The prospective bid by Miller in conjunction with a yet-to-be
identified partner or partners has fueled hopes that Field's will
be returned to local ownership.
   Miller declined to comment on the bidding but in an October
interview with the Chicago Tribune, he pledged to fight for control
of Field's.
   ``The worst scenario would be to have someone come in here and
treat it like any old department store and have it become just
another store,'' Miller said. ``This is clearly not what Chicago
wants or deserves.''
   In the interview, Miller said that under his leadership, Field's
annual sales have gone from about $650 million to more than $1.1
billion and annual profit has doubled to an estimated $90 million
in 1989 from $45 million in 1983.
   He has concentrated on restoring class to the chain whose early
motto, ``Give the lady what she wants,'' promised customer
satisfaction.
   Miller's likeliest opponent, St. Louis-based May, could fill a
hole in its national coverage with Marshall Field. May owns 14
department-store chains, including Lord &amp; Taylor and Hecht's.

<HEAD>GTE Records 20 Percent Fourth-Quarter Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. said Tuesday its 1989
fourth-quarter earnings rose 20 percent because of strong
performances by its telephone and telecommunications units.
   The company said net income was $392 million, or $1.15 per
share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1989, compared with $326
million, or 96 cents a share, in the same 1988 period.
   Quarterly revenue increased 7 percent to $4.6 billion from $4.3
billion a year earlier.
   For the year, GTE posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $4.16 per
share, up from $1.2 billion, or $3.58 a share, in 1988. Revenue
totaled $17.4 billion, up 6 percent from $16.5 billion the year
before.
   GTE said revenue from telephone operations was up 7 percent
because of higher foreign revenue, more telephone use and more
access lines in service. It said the improvements were offset by
various rate reductions and other charges costing $300 million last
year.
   ``Telephone operations performed exceptionally well in 1989,''
James L. Johnson, GTE chairman and chief executive officer, said in
a statement. He said a reorganization and consolidation announced
in 1988 is proceeding on schedule.
   Revenue from telecommunications products and services increased
9 percent last year, with higher sales of cellular-mobile phone
services, satellite services, government communications systems and
directory advertising.
   GTE said its cellular-mobile phone unit grew to 263,000
customers in 1989 from 50,000 customers.
   Sales of electrical products fell 2 percent, which the company
attributed to lower prices, the sale of some marginal businesses
and weaker currencies overseas. It also said fourth-quarter
operating income was off due to a restructuring.

   Stock prices finished broadly lower today,
although a late-afternoon rally trimmed the losses for the session.
   Trading activity was moderate, picking up the pace from Monday
which was the slowest trading day of the new year.
   Stock prices had risen in three of the past four sessions after
sinking for most of the month of January.
   Some analysts said today's decline was an indication that the
market's broader trend is still lower.
   The prospect of rising interest rates has inhibited recent price
gains, making yields on short-term Treasury securities more
competitive with those available on stocks and dimming chances for
corporate earnings growth.
   Those worries grew more pronounced as the Treasury's auction of
$30 billion in new securities approached this week.
   In the credit markets today, rates edged up on six-month
Treasury bills while yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the
8.56 percent level from 8.53 percent late Monday.

<HEAD>Texas Air Posts $362.8 Million Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-TWA-Icahn, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company, said Tuesday it lost $362.8 million in the fourth quarter
of 1989 as subsidiaries Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines
both posted losses.
   Texas Air's deficit was widened from a net loss of $224.4
million in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The latest quarterly loss, amounting to $9.17 a share, pushed
Texas Air's loss for all of 1989 to $22.71 a share, or $885.6
million _ a record high for the U.S. airline industry. That
compares with its 1988 loss of $718.6 million, or $18.88 a share.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $1.7 billion from $2 billion. For
the full year, Texas Air's revenue was $6.7 billion, down from $8.6
billion in 1988.
   The October-December figures include a $56.1 million net loss
for Houston-based Continental, narrowed from a $99.2 million loss
in the fourth quarter of 1988. Continental's fourth-quarter revenue
was $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion.
   For the year, Continental turned a $3.1 million profit,
reversing a $315.5 million loss for 1988. Full-year revenue was
$5.1 billion, up from $4.7 billion in 1988.
   ``We are pleased with Continental's strong improvement in
profitability in 1989,'' Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said in a
statement. ``In addition, given the significantly negative factors
affecting all airlines in the fourth quarter, Continental stands
out as the only major carrier showing marked improvement in
year-over-year fourth-quarter results.''
   Continental's figures included one-time net gains of $81.2
million from asset sales and $10.6 million in retired debt.
   Miami-based Eastern, which is reorganizing under federal
bankruptcy court supervision, showed a fourth-quarter net loss of
$282.6 million on revenue of $482.2 million. In the fourth quarter
of 1988, Eastern lost $101.7 million on revenue of $844.4 million.
   For all of 1989, Eastern lost $852.3 million on revenue of $1.5
billion, compared with a 1988 loss of $335.4 million on revenue of
$3.8 billion.
   ``Eastern's unique situation in 1989 obviously had a major
impact on Texas Air's consolidated results,'' Lorenzo said. ``But
as Eastern finalizes its reorganization plans, we are confident
that a far more competitive airline will emerge.''
   Eastern was hit by a crippling strike last March, forcing it
into Chapter 11 reorganization. The unions representing pilots and
flight attendants called off their sympathy walkouts in November,
but the Machinists union remains on strike.
   The airline has hired mainly non-union workers to replace the
strikers and is restructuring as a smaller carrier.
   ``Eastern's unique situation in 1989 obviously had a major
impact on Texas Air's consolidated results,'' Lorenzo said. ``But
as Eastern finalizes its reorganization plans, we are confident
that a far more competitive airline will emerge.''
   Eastern management recently proposed to pay unsecured creditors
only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges
from bankruptcy protection, and another 70 percent over the
following 10 years, without interest. In return for accepting
partial repayment, Texas Air would give the unsecured creditors 40
percent of Eastern's equity.
   In addition, preferred shareholders would receive no more than
10 cents on the dollar in the form of new stock. A committee
representing preferred shareholders attacked the plan.
   Eastern's fourth-quarter losses included a special charge of
$153.7 million in back pay to some pilots, pension curtailment
costs and legal expenses for the bankruptcy case.

<HEAD>Bank Halts Distribution of Newsletter That Featured Ethnic Slurs</HEAD>

   First Union National Bank on Tuesday
stopped distributing copies of a newsletter that referred to
Germans as ``Huns'' and Japanese as ``Nips'' in an article
satirizing fears of foreign investment.
   The bank also issued apologies about the article appearing in
the Feb. 1 edition of the newsletter, which the bank said already
had been mailed to some 600 of its customers, after it received
media calls asking about the piece.
   William R. Hackney III, First Union's chief investment officer
and the author of the article, referred questions to the bank's
public relations staff.
   ``He was trying to satirize American economic weaknesses and he
deeply regrets his choice of words,'' said First Union spokesman
Jeep Bryant.
   In response to a request for a copy of the newsletter, Bryant
said the bank was ``embarrassed by its content ... so we've stopped
distributing it.''
   The article, titled ``Racial Overtones'' refers twice to Germans
as ``Huns'' and three times to the Japanese as ``Nips'' in what it
characterizes as a ``tongue-in-cheek'' assault on foreign
investment in the United States.
   The article begins: ``The Huns and the Nips are at it again!
Fouling up our capital markets. The folks from the lands of Teuton
and Nippon jacked up their interest rates sharply in recent months,
dragging our rates along with them.
   ``(They) yanked the rug out from under our stock and bond
markets. That's the thanks we get for protecting them from the
Russians all these years.''
   Hackney told The News and Observer of Raleigh on Monday that he
intended to poke fun at U.S. fears of foreign investment in an
obvious tongue-in-cheek style.
   ``Those terms, while they are slang, are like calling folks in
the United States `Yanks','' he said.
   Charlotte-based First Union _ one of the largest banks in the
Southeast _ issued an apology Monday in response to inquiries from
the newspaper, and Bryant reiterated the apology Tuesday.
   ``It was not our intention to speak in a derogatory way about
the German and Japanese people,'' he said.
   However, German and Japanese government representatives took
exception to the article.
   Hans-Jochen Schmidt of the Consultate General of the Federal
Republic of Germany said the term ``Hun'' suggested ``uncivilized
barbarians.''
   ``We wouldn't appreciate being called that,'' he said in a phone
interview from Atlanta.
   Schmidt also disagreed with Hackney's characterization of the
ethnic terms as slang.
   ``It's far more negative,'' he said. ``I can't imagine a bank
would condone such a characterization. Banks like First Union are
trying to reach out to the entire world.''
   The Japanese Consultate General, which oversees cultural and
business trade in the Southeast, issued a statement from its
Atlanta office saying: ``While we find the choice of words used in
the First Union newsletter very unfortunate, we trust and hope it
is not representative of the attitude of this region.
   Bryant said the bank had received only a handful of phone calls
about the newsletter _ mostly from the news media.

<HEAD>Kodak Reports Only Third Quarterly Loss in its History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. on Tuesday announced a
loss of $60 million for the final quarter of 1989, due mainly to
the costs of a restructuring the photographic company began earlier
in the year.
   The loss marked only the third time in Kodak's history that it
has reported red ink.
   Company officials and industry analysts cautiously predicted
improved earnings in 1990 as Kodak begins to realize savings from
the restructuring.
   The loss, which amounted to 19 cents per share, compared with
earnings of $312 million, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth
quarter of 1988.
   Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $4.89 billion, up 8 percent
from $4.54 billion in the 1988 period.
   Fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by restructuring charges of
$322 million, or $525 million before taxes, bringing total charges
for 1989 to $549 million, or $875 million before taxes.
   As part of the restructuring, Kodak sold or consolidated about
20 businesses and eliminated 7,500 jobs during 1989 in United
States and abroad, most through voluntary separation, attrition and
transfers to other businesses.
   Kodak's earnings for all of 1989 declined 62 percent to $529
million, or $1.63 per share, compared with $1.40 billion, or $4.31
per share, in 1988.
   Sales for the year totaled $18.4 billion, up 8 percent from
$17.93 billion in 1988.
   ``Clearly, 1989 was a difficult year for Kodak, with significant
expenses related to our restructuring efforts as the most visible
sign,'' Kodak Chairman Colby H. Chandler said in a statement.
   ``Earnings were further restrained by the impact of general
inflation on operating costs, higher interest expense and the
unfavorable impact of exchange-rate fluctuations,'' he said.
   All segments of the company reported increases in quarterly and
annual sales. But information systems earnings dropped for both the
quarter and the year even without the restructuring costs, and
quarterly earnings from chemical sales also sagged.
   Quarterly earnings in the health segment, which includes
Sterling Drug Inc., increased 15 percent without restructuring
costs, but dropped 9 percent for the year.
   Without the restructuring costs, total Kodak quarterly earnings
would have been $262 million, or 80 cents per share, down 16
percent from last year, while annual earnings for the year would
have declined 23 percent to $1.08 billion, or $3.32 per share.
   Mark Obenzinger, an industry analyst with Trinity Trading Co. of
New York, said Kodak expects to save $450 million to $500 million
from the restructuring last year. Those savings should start to
appear in mid-1990, he said, but the company will continue to face
competitive and financial pressures.
   ``They'll have to do even better than that in 1990 and set up a
momentum that continues into 1991,'' Obenzinger said.
   Analyst Brenda Landry of Morgan Stanley said she thought Kodak
would only manage to save about $350 million. Landry said she was
revising her estimate for Kodak's 1990 earnings downward from $4.20
per share to around $3.70 or $3.75.
   Health care profits will be lower than anticipated and ``the
chemical business we know will be falling apart,'' she said.
   Chandler said he expects things to improve for Kodak in 1990.
   ``We look forward to higher sales, better earnings from
operations, and improved cash flows, especially in later quarters
when the benefits of initiatives put into place are more fully
realized,'' he said.
   But Chandler warned that ``uncertainties in the U.S. economy,
the down cycle in the chemical industry, and a softening in the
domestic market for office equipment ... could restrain somewhat
the gains which might otherwise have been achieved.''
   The company has had a troubled decade, laying off thousands of
workers in 1983, 1986 and 1989 in efforts to turn around sagging
profits.
   The two previous losses recorded by Kodak also resulted from
special charges _ in 1985 when the company gave up its instant
photography business and in 1986 when more than 10,000 workers were
laid off in an earlier restructuring.

<HEAD>Hallmark to Buy Back Debt of Spanish TV Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. on Tuesday began an
offer to buy back at a discount some $270 million in debt
securities used to finance Univision Holdings Inc., under a plan to
ease the debt burden on the unprofitable Spanish-language
broadcaster.
   The action by Hallmark, which owns a 63.5 percent stake in
Univision, followed Univision's failure to make $10 million in
interest payments due last week on some of the debt.
   Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language communications
company, said it missed the payments because of insufficient cash
flow.
   Hallmark issued a statement saying it also was seeking
concessions on some $315 million in bank loans, including a revised
repayment schedule and increased availability of money.
   Hallmark, which is privately held, declined to comment further
about the offer and referred all questions to Thomas M. Daly Jr. of
Kekst and Co., a New York public relations firm. Daly would not say
why Hallmark was making the offer.
   Univision owns eight full-power Spanish-language television
stations and the Spanish-language network Univision, which has more
than 500 affiliates.
   The company reported a net loss of $31.6 million for the year
ended Dec. 31, 1988, the latest annual figures available. It had
1988 revenue of $132 million.
   Hallmark and a unit of the banking concern First Chicago Corp.
began their interest in the Spanish-language communications network
by acquiring five Spanish-language stations in 1987.
   First Chicago now owns 21.5 percent of Univision, while Hallmark
owns a 63.5 percent stake. The rest, 15 percent, is owned by trusts
of descendants of Univision's former owners.
   Hallmark said it planned to buy back two series of Univision
debt securities, offering 30 cents on the dollar for one issue with
a face value of $105 million and 45 cents on the dollar for a
second issue with a face value of $165 million.
   The original proceeds of those securities, issued in July 1988,
were used to repay two loans supplied by Hallmark for Univision
acquisitions.
   Hallmark also said that if the debt restructuring was completed,
it would defer for five years the interest payments due on both
debt securities.
   Hallmark also is seeking unspecified concessions from First
Chicago. The Wall Street Journal quoted people it said were close
to the debt negotiations as saying that First Chicago's stake in
Univision would be reduced in return for improved prospects that it
would recoup its investment.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
two New York rating services, lowered their credit ratings on both
Univision debt securities last Friday.

   The dollar ended mixed against other major
currencies Tuesday as buyers were preoccupied with the West German
mark.
   Gold prices fell in domestic and overseas trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $421.30 a troy ounce, $1.10 lower than Monday's
close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold
bullion at $420.70 as of 4 p.m. EST, down $2.05 from Monday's late
bid.
   Currency dealers described dollar trading as uneventful because
the mark has been the center of attention. The mark has been buoyed
by developments in Eastern Europe that are expected to benefit West
Germany economically.
   ``It's more of a mark-driven market right now rather than a
dollar-driven market,'' said Thomas Palladino, a dealer at the
Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's New York office. ``The sentiment still
seems to be in favor of selling the dollar but more so of buying
the mark.''
   Traders also were awaiting the outcome of the Communist Party
meeting in Moscow, which was unexpectedly lenghthened and will
enter a third day Wednesday.
   News that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had called on
the party to relinquish its monopoly on power spurred purchases of
marks because it was taken as a sign that the pace of reform in the
East bloc may quicken.
   The dollar ended the day in New York at 1.65605 West German
marks, down from 1.6590 marks Monday. That was below the closing
level in Europe of 1.6570 marks, which was down from 1.6670 in
Europe late Monday.
   Dealers said confidence in the dollar was shaken by uncertainty
ahead of the Treasury Department's quarterly financing operation
this week. There has been speculation that Japanese investors might
not be big buyers of the $30 billion of notes and bonds being sold
in three auctions.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell 0.70 yen
to close at 144.90 yen. Later, it was quoted at 145.10 yen in
London and at 145.245 yen in New York, up from 144.70 yen Monday.
Dealers expect the dollar to remain firm against the yen before
Japanese national elections Feb. 18.
   The British pound rose to $1.7015 from $1.6980 late Monday and
to $1.7030 from $1.7000 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.4763 Swiss francs, up from 1.47275; 5.64 French
francs, up from 5.6370; 1,233.50 Italian lire, up from 1,231.00;
and 1.18755 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18735.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late levels Monday
were: 1.4770 Swiss francs, down from 1.4780; 5.6405 French francs,
down from 5.6573; 1,235.00 Italian lire, down from 1,236.00; and
1.1874 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1891.
   Gold and silver prices posted modest declines on world markets.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $420.85 a troy
ounce, down from $432.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at
$420.75, down from $423 bid late Monday. Gold in Hong Kong rose
$2.61 to close at a bid $419.47.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.306 a troy ounce, down from Monday's settlement of $5.329.
Silver bullion traded at a late bid price of $5.31 a troy ounce
Tuesday, down from $5.37 bid late Monday.

   The stock market slumped in sluggish trading
Tuesday, weighed down by worries that this week's government
borrowing binge will drive interest rates higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 19.82
points on Monday, lost 16.21 points to close at 2,606.31. The
market's best-known indicator had been down 25 points with about
two hours left in the session.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
578 up, 909 down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 134.07 million
shares, only slightly ahead of the 130.95 million shares traded on
Monday in the slowest session to date in the new year.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 163.44 million shares.
   Stocks had made some gains in the four sessions leading up to
Tuesday's trading after sinking for most of the month of January.
   But even as prices rose, the prospect of rising interest rates
limited the advance, making yields on short-term Treasury
securities more competitive with those available on stocks and
dimming chances for corporate earnings growth.
   ``The market is back to its dominant short-term trend which is
down,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical market
analysis at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Jack Baker, head of block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said he sees no evidence that ``institutions feel any need to
commit new capital to equities. They are happy to be where they are
with equities.''
   The financial community has been especially alert to the impact
on interest rates of this week's $30 billion auction of new
Treasury securities.
   That three-part auction got underway on Tuesday with the sale of
$10 billion in three-year notes at an average yield of 8.43
percent, and some credit market analysts termed the sale a success.
   But two more auctions will follow in short order, with $10
billion in 10-year notes going on sale Wednesday and $10 billion in
30-year bonds on Thursday.
   In the credit markets Tuesday, 30-year Treasury bond prices lost
as much as $5 for every $1,000 in face value and their yields rose
to 8.58 percent from 8.53 percent late Monday.
   Pan Am led the list of most actively-traded stocks on the NYSE,
falling &lsqb; to 3|. The Pam Am board met Tuesday but made no
announcement. A union official said Sunday that Pan Am was
considering a deal with the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   Also on the active list, IBM rose 1&rsqb; to 101, Bank of New England
rose 1 to 6}, Philip Morris lost | to 38\ and General Electric rose
\ to 62.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell { to 39{. Several of the
former Bell System regional companies also fell. Southwestern Bell
fell 1{ to 53|, U S West lost 1\ to 70&lsqb;, Bell South fell | to 52}
and Nynex lost | to 80}.
   Eastman Kodak tumbled 1{ to 37~. It reported a fourth-quarter
loss of 19 cents a share compared with net income of 96 cents a
share a year ago. It cited costs of a restructuring program begun
earlier in the year.
   Precious metals stocks, which rose on Monday, reversed course.
ASA lost 1\ to 71&rsqb;, Homestake Mining fell { to 23 and Newmont Gold
fell &rsqb; to 56&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $15.18 billion, or 0.47
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.02 to 182.33.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.20 to 380.09, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 2.17 to 329.68.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.74 to 423.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 354.74, up 0.04.

<HEAD>Profit-Taking Ends 3-Day Gold Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices slipped Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange amid profit taking, ending a three-day rally that peaked
when the contract for April delivery failed to find support above
$430 an ounce.
   Silver futures also turned lower.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures were mostly lower;
orange juice futures rebounded; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower.
   Gold futures settled $1.10 to $1.50 lower with the contract for
delivery in February at $421.30 a troy ounce; silver finished 2.3
cents to 2.4 cents lower with March at $5.33 a troy ounce.
   Gold for February delivery had surged a total of $10 an ounce in
the three previous sessions, mainly on supportive chart signals
that defied the anti-inflationary rise in interest rates, a bearish
fundamental factor.
   Analysts also noted that gold's strength had not been confirmed
by similarly sharp increases in silver and platinum prices.
   The gold rally passed a milestone Monday when the heavily traded
contract for April delivery moved above $430 an ounce, but
confidence in the market then waned.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with the investment firm
PaineWebber Inc., said gold historically has performed poorly in
February, which might account for traders' reluctance to keep
betting on higher prices.
   ``If history serves as a guide, I would be on my guard here,''
he said.
   But another analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal &amp; Co., said
uncertainty surrounding stock prices and the political upheaval in
Eastern Europe could keep investors interested in gold.
   ``The market's looking at several things, so I don't think you
can just look at the traditional history'' such as the February
effect, he said.
   Petroleum futures turned in a mixed performance on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's
weekly inventory report, which showed higher-than-expected supplies
across the board.
   The API reported a 7.7-million-barrel increase in U.S. stocks of
crude oil, a 4.7-million-barrel rise in gasoline stocks and a
4.5-million-barrel increase in supplies of petroleum distillates,
which include home heating oil.
   Analysts said the report could prompt selling of futures across
the board on Wednesday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 12
cents higher with March at $22.51 a barrel; heating oil was .15
cent lower to .24 cent higher with March at 56.19 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.08 cents lower to 1.2 cents higher with
March at 61.88 cents a gallon.
   Orange juice futures rose sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange, reclaiming most of the ground lost Monday in a
technically inspired sell-off.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 2.05 cents to 5 cents
higher with May at $1.928 a pound.
   Soybean futures rose modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
bullish technical signals and signs of stronger foreign demand.
Corn futures also advanced while wheat futures retreated.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 3 cents lower with March at
$3.82} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with March at
$2.37} a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent higher with March at
$1.35{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 4{ cents higher with
March at $5.62} a bushel.
   Profit-taking kept most cattle futures under pressure on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures retreated in line
with weakening cash markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher
with February at 79.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with March at 82.67 cents a pound; live
hogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower with February at 48.82 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .45 cent lower with
February at 50.50 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished mixed in choppy
trading Tuesday as the market awaited the latest inventory
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 12 cents
to end at $22.51 a barrel. The contract traded in a 42-cent range
during the session after falling 63 cents on Monday. Crude
contracts for later delivery were fairly narrowly mixed.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March
contract for regular unleaded gasoline fell 0.52 cent to 61.88
cents a gallon, after a 1.82-cents loss on Monday. The contract had
traded as high as 62.80 cents during the session. The April
contract lost 1.08 cents to 62.62 cents a gallon and May was down
0.72 to 65.67 cents.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery, which tumbled 2.31 cents
in the previous session, edged up 0.24 cent to 56.19 cents a
gallon. Later contract months were down slightly.
   Analysts said prices fluctuated in a relatively wide range
throughout the session, with crude oil breaking through the $22.37
technical level on the downside. The market later turned higher but
stalled as investors turned cautious ahead of the weekly inventory
report by the API, a trade association representing mainly large
oil refiners.
   ``People are waiting for the statistics tonight to get a clearer
picture of things,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trading at
United Energy Inc.
   Analysts said the market generally anticipated an increase in
product supplies but was mixed with regard to crude oil inventories.
   The report, released after the close of trading Tuesday,
actually showed sharp increases in both crude oil and refined
products. For the week ended Feb. 2, crude oil inventories rose 7.7
million barrels to 351.1 million; heating oil stocks rose 4.5
million barrels to 121 million barrels; and gasoline stocks rose
4.7 million barrels to 231.4 million barrels.

<HEAD>Emerson First Qtr. Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerson Electric Co., the world's leading maker
of electric motors, said Tuesday first-quarter profits rose 3.8
percent while sales declined.
   It was the company's 129th straight quarter, dating back to
1957, in which profits have increased.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Emerson earned $141.9
million, or 64 cents a share, compared with $136.8 million, or 61
cents a share, a year ago. Revenue totaled $1.6 billion, down 4.3
percent from $1.7 billion.
   The company attributed the sales decline to the divestiture of
several companies in the last half of the year including Day-Brite,
an industrial lighting company, and five small electronics firms.
   The divestiture reduced sales in the quarter by $90 million.
   ``Our financial position remains strong,'' said Charles Knight,
Emerson's chairman and chief executive officer.
   He noted that the company remained one of the few U.S.-based
manufacturing firms with a triple-A credit rating. The rating was
reaffirmed recently after Emerson spent $460 million to acquire
Leroy Somer, a French electric motor maker, and $135 million for
McGill Manufacturing, a maker of bearings and industrial electrical
products.
   Knight said the company's capital goods divisions, which make
industrial monitoring equipment and machines and components for
assembly lines and other uses, had the best showing in the quarter.
   Sales were slow in computer support products, consumer tools and
appliance components, he said.
   Emerson is the leading maker of garbage disposals, refrigerator
compressors and uninterruptible power supplies for computers. It
also makes Craftsman tools for Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.
   ``Our capital goods related businesses have record level
backlogs and expect good sales performances in the second
quarter,'' Knight said in a news release.
   The results for the St. Louis-based company, which turns 100
years old this year, kick off what company officials hope will be
Emerson's 33rd straight year of record profits.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused
Security National Bancorp Inc. on Tuesday of filing false and
misleading statements in the Louisiana holding company's annual
report and other documents.
   A civil complaint filed at federal court in the District of
Columbia accused the Shreveport, La.-based concern and its
president and chairman, Wesley Godfrey Jr., of failing to disclose,
among other things, that the company's primary asset, Security
National Bank, had been declared insolvent.
   The SEC complaint alleged that an independent auditor's report
prepared for inclusion in the company's 1988 annual report to the
SEC was substantially altered and some parts were omitted entirely.
   ``Basically, it was a cut-and-paste job on the auditors' opinion
on the annual report,'' said Bruce Hiler, an SEC attorney in
Washington.
   There was no answer at Security National Bancorp on Tuesday
evening and it could not otherwise be reached for comment.
   The SEC complaint further alleged that the company's 1988 filing
failed to disclose that the independent auditors had resigned three
weeks before the annual report was filed; failed to disclose in a
timely manner that Godfrey obtained control of the company in
Decemeber 1988; and failed to disclose that the Comptroller of the
Currency declared the company's sole subsidiary and primary asset,
Security National Bank of Shreveport, insolvent and put it under
the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Hiler said the company's shares were not traded on any exchange
or the National Association of Security Dealers quotation system
for over-the-counter stocks.
   The lawsuit seeks a court order barring the company and Godfrey
from any further alleged violations of securities law and requiring
compliance with SEC disclosure rules.
   Hiler said that to his knowledge, no criminal charges have been
filed.

   Polaroid Corp. on Tuesday reported it
earned $46.5 million in the fourth quarter and $145 million for the
year in contrast to losses for both periods in 1988 when the
company fought off a takeover bid.
   For the fourth quarter, the photography company posted earnings
per share of 72 cents in contrast to a loss of $7.5 million, or 10
cents per share, in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose to $538.1 million from $533.2 million
in 1988.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Polaroid had earnings of $145
million, or $1.96 a share, in contrast to a loss of $22.6 million,
or 34 cents a share, in 1988.
   Annual sales rose to $1.9 billion from $1.86 billion the
previous year.
   The losses stemmed from a restructuring plan the company
undertook while thwarting a takeover attempt by Shamrock Holdings,
which cost the company $151.9 million in 1988.
   ``Our results attest to the significant progress and fundamental
changes made at Polaroid in 1989, all building and delivering value
to our shareholders,'' I. MacAllister Booth, the company president,
said.
   ``This past year, we increased productivity, controlled our
overhead and developed new marketing perspectives for growth in the
1990s,'' he said.
   The company, known for its instant photography, has
``established a foothold for conventional film worldwide,'' Booth
said.
   Also, he said, Polaroid this year will begin testing its
electronic imaging system for the medical field.
   Booth added, however, ``we recognize we have much more to do,
particularly in stimulating sales growth. To this end, we already
have in place new marketing programs and new advertising
approaches.''

   Media General Inc. said its financial services
division would shut its two main publications at the end of the
month and switch to providing data through electronic information
systems.
   Media General Financial Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Richmond-based Media General, plans to shut The Financial Weekly
and IndustriScope.
   The Financial Weekly contains statistical information and news
reports about company stocks, while IndustriScope is a monthly
tabloid containing investment analyses of various industries. The
combined circulation of the publications is about 3,000.
   The decision, announced Monday, could affect up to five jobs,
but Media General said it would try to place those employees
elsewhere.
   ``Although visonary and unique when they were introduced in the
early 1970s, such weekly or monthly publications have been rendered
essentially obsolete by the overwhelming use of computers in the
financial community,'' said Dennis H. Cartwright, president and
chief executive officer of Media General Financial Services.
   ``Users of our financial data bases increasingly demand services
that can only be provided electronically.''
   Cartwright said the division has expanded its ability to provide
financial data services electronically and is about to complete a
three-year program to convert all data base management systems to
new computers.
   Among Media General's other holdings are The Richmond News
Leader and the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

   The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese
yen early Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
edged lower.
   The dollar started trading at 145.18 yen, up 0.28 yen from
Tuesday's close of 144.90 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
35.42 points Tuesday, shed 13.73 points shortly after the market
opened to move to 37,653.10.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range
during early trading because the market was focused on
cross-trading between the yen and the West German mark.
   ``As for dollar-yen trading, many market players are taking a
wait-and-see position,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo who
spoke anonymously.
   The dealer said the less active trading for the dollar was
partly due to the one-day extension of the Soviet Communist Party
Central Committee meeting, originally set to end Tuesday.
   At the meeting, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced a
dramatic proposal to terminate the Communist Party's monopoly on
power. Some dealers said the mark was being bought on speculation
that Gorbachev had gained support for his reform plan.

<TEXT>
   When Coast Guard officers boarded the
oil-spewing Exxon Valdez and asked skipper Joseph Hazelwood to
explain the problem, he replied: ``You're looking at it,'' the
ship's radio officer testified Tuesday.
   James Roberson was asked by defense attorney Michael Chalos to
interpret Hazelwood's remark. Chalos suggested Hazelwood was
referring to the overall situation on the crippled tanker. But
Roberson disagreed.
   ``I took it to mean that he meant himself,'' said the witness in
Hazelwood's trial in the nation's worst oil spill.
   Minutes later, Roberson said, a U.S. Coast Guard commander came
to his radio office to use a phone.
   ``I overheard the commander saying, `I smelled alcohol on his
breath. I want a technician out here,''' Roberson recalled.
   Blood tests on Hazelwood taken 10{ hours after the tanker ran
aground showed a blood-alcohol ratio of .061, lower than Alaska's
limit for a driver to be considered legally intoxicated but above
the federal limit for operating a commercial vessel.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone suggested out of the jury's
presence that attorneys were failing to address a critical issue:
whether there was liquor aboard the Exxon Valdez that night. If no
liquor was found, he said, it would mean that Hazelwood's
blood-alcohol level might have been much higher earlier in the
evening.
   Roberson, however, was the third crewman to attest that
Hazelwood was sober and clearly in control of the ship, and showed
no signs of drunkeness.
   ``I would describe him as serious, calm,'' said Roberson who had
seen Hazelwood drinking at a Valdez bar earlier in the day.
   Roberson was preceded on the stand by a marine pilot who
testified that there was a telltale trace of liquor on Hazelwood's
breath, but said the captain's judgment seemed unimpaired an hour
before the tanker hit Bligh Reef and spilled nearly 11 million
gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound.
   The two crew members' testimony challenged the prosecution's
theory that Hazelwood had been drinking all day and was not in
control when the tanker foundered on Bligh Reef.
   Under cross-examination by Hazelwood's attorney, pilot William
E. Murphy told jurors he saw none of the usual signs of
intoxication in the captain when Murphy left the ship shortly
before it ran aground.
   ``Did you see anything that indicated the captain was impaired
in any way?'' asked defense attorney Michael Chelos.
   ``Not at all,'' Murphy replied firmly.
   Murphy said Hazelwood's speech was not slurred. He also answered
negatively when asked if Hazelwood's movements changed, if his eyes
were watery and if he had a mood change from that afternoon when
the men had a non-alcoholic lunch together.
   ``He seemed the same to me,'' Murphy said.
   He added that he observed Hazelwood giving orders to his crew
which seemed clear, and seemed in command of his ship.
   When questioned Monday, Murphy said he smelled alcohol on
Hazelwood's breath hours before the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   Earlier in the day, Johnstone refused to let jurors hear about a
grounding incident a couple months later involving Murphy.
   In a brief hearing outside the jury's presence, Murphy said the
boat, which carried 13 schoolchildren, ended its journey safely
because ``I drove it up on the beach.''
   Murphy acknowledged that even the best mariners occasionally run
aground. But Johnstone refused to let jurors hear that, saying:
``The fact that other mariners may have grounded vessels is not
probative in this case.''
   He also declined to let jurors consider the impact of the
accident on Murphy's testimony.
   On Monday, Murphy recalled joining Hazelwood and two other crew
members for lunch in Valdez, where their tanker had picked up its
cargo of oil last March.
   After lunch, he said, he dropped off the captain across the
street from a bar called the Pipeline Club, and when he next saw
Hazelwood aboard the Exxon Valdez about eight hours later, there
was the smell of alcohol about him.
   ``While on the bridge did you notice any signs that he had been
drinking?'' Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole asked.
   ``No,'' replied Murphy. ``Except I smelled something I
associated with alcohol on his breath.''
   Within 30 minutes, he said, Hazelwood had gone below and
remained there about an hour while Murphy checked the weather
facing the ship in its tricky passage through the Valdez Narrows.
   ``It's not unusual for masters to leave the bridge,'' said
Murphy, but added, ``It wasn't typical to be gone for that long in
the narrows.''
   Cole had maintained in his opening statement that Hazelwood was
drunk and absent from his post when the tanker crashed onto the
reef, and said Hazelwood spent the seven hours before the trip in a
bar ordering vodka.
   Hazelwood is on trial on a felony charge of second-degree
mischief, and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment,
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while
intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is
seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   To prove criminal mischief the state must show that Hazelwood
recklessly created a risk of damage to the property of another in
excess of $100,000.
   Under rules at the time of the Exxon Valdez accident, pilots
were required to guide outbound ships to a point just short of
Bligh Reef.
   The rules have been changed to require pilots, local boat
handlers familiar with coastal waters, to remain aboard past Bligh
Reef.
