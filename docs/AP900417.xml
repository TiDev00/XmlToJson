   President Bush warned Tuesday of ``appropriate
responses'' if Moscow imposes announced cuts in fuel supplies to
Lithuania, but also said he does not want to damage superpower
relations.
   A Soviet journalist, meanwhile, was quoted as saying Moscow
would cancel the cuts. The journalist denied having made the remark.
   ``I want to be sure anything we do is productive,'' Bush said.
``There's been dramatic change in the world and I don't want to
inadvertently take some action that would set it back.''
   The Soviet government said it had ordered drastic cuts in
natural gas supplies to Lithuania on Tuesday, followed by cuts in
oil and gasoline on Wednesday. U.S. officials said they could not
confirm any slowdown.
   But by Tuesday night, a Soviet journalist was reported as saying
Soviet President Mikhali S. Gorbachev would revoke the order.
Vladimir Matyash, the Washington bureau chief of the Soviet news
agency Tass, told CIA Director William Webster the order ``was a
mistake'' and that that ``President Gorbachev will have an
announcement tomorrow revoking that,'' according to National Public
Radio.
   The conversation took place at a reception held by the Public
Broadcasting System. The NPR account said Webster had raised the
issue with the Soviet journalist, eliciting his reply.
   When asked how he knew Gorbachev's intentions, Matyash replied,
``You can be sure it's true. I have a direct line to Moscow,''
according to NPR.
   The NPR reporter, Daniel Schorr, said he overhead the
Webster-Matyash conversation and both knew he was there.
   But Matyash said later Schorr's account was ``not accurate.''
   ``What I said and what I meant was, there was no confirmation
from Moscow that Moscow would exercise the sanctions'' that
Gorbachev announced, the interruption gas supplies.
   ``Schorr misunderstood me. Please kill the story,'' Matyash said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., conferred separately with Bush about
increased tensions in Lithuania.
   ``I think it's a very serious matter, a very serious, delicate
situation,'' Mitchell said afterward.
   Mitchell said that, based on what happens in Lithuania, Bush
should review whether the United States proceeds with closer
cooperation with Moscow on trade, tax matters and the environment.
``I regard the action taken by the Soviets as wrong,'' Mitchell
said.
   Lawmakers have warned that Congress might act on its own with
economic pressure against Moscow if the Soviets escalate efforts to
block Lithuania's drive for independence.
   Bush took a two-pronged approach of warning and conciliation as
the administration waited to see if Moscow carried out threats of
economic sanctions against the breakaway Baltic republic.
   Responding to the latest news, Bush said the United States was
monitoring developments ``very, very closely, and we are waiting to
see if the Soviet announcements are implemented.''
   ``Clearly those announcements are contrary to the approach that
we have urged and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union,''
Bush said. ``We are considering appropriate responses if these
threats are implemented.''
   He refused to elaborate, saying, ``I would simply repeat that
what we need is dialogue, discussion and a peaceful resolution of
this great difficulty there.''
   Bush made his comments during a picture-taking session in the
Oval Office with visiting President Rafael L. Callejas of Honduras.
Separately, the White House released the transcript of an interview
conducted Monday with foreign journalists.
   On Lithuania, Bush said in the interview that any U.S. reaction
to Soviet economic pressures against the Baltic republic should be
productive and should not risk a setback in reforms championed by
Gorbachev.
   ``And yet,'' Bush said, ``I don't want to be seen as one who is
not interested in the peaceful change and in the self-determination
for Lithuania.''
   In recent weeks, high-level U.S. officials have been meeting to
consider what steps the administration might take in response to
various Soviet actions against Lithuania. Most of the options
apparently involve economic measures, such as denying Moscow
improved trade status or blocking its entry into international
economic organizations.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked if the
administration had compiled a list of options, said, ``If there
were, I would not be prepared to answer that question.''
   She said Bush's five-day summit with Gorbachev beginning May 30
still was planned.
   She praised the Lithuanians for ``making an effort'' to resolve
the dispute through dialogue and again urged the Soviets to
peacefully engage the leaders of the independence-minded Baltic
republic.
   A U.S. official said privately that the United States probably
would not try to make up the fuel losses for Lithuania, since the
Soviets would have to give permission for U.S. deliveries and that
would defeat the purpose of Moscow's sanctions.

Died at 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James P. O'Donnell, a former European
correspondent and editor for Newsweek, the Saturday Evening Post
and Daily News who wrote a best-seller on Hitler's final days, died
of cancer. He was 72.
   O'Donnell, a professor at Boston University, died Monday at
Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   O'Donnell wrote hundreds of articles on Europe, North Africa and
the Middle East. He met Hitler on several occasions while a student
in Germany. He also met or interviewed Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Dwight Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle.
   O'Donnell covered the Nuremburg trial and the Berlin airlift as
Berlin bureau chief for Newsweek from 1945 until 1948.
   After his release from the Army in July 1945, Newsweek sent
O'Donnell to Berlin to write about Hitler's bunker, where he found
written materials ranging from looseleaf notebooks and files to
diaries and appointment books.
   ``At least five Red Army search teams had been in the bunker the
day it fell,'' he later wrote after gaining access to the bunker by
giving a Russian guard a pack of cigarettes. ``They had been
looking for only one thing, the body.''
   He was a Paris correspondent for New York's Daily News from 1949
to 1950. For the next decade, he was contributing editor and
associate editor for Europe for the Saturday Evening Post.
   He worked on John F. Kennedy's successful 1960 presidential
campaign, and later advised him on Berlin and Germany.
   His book about Hitler, `The Bunker,'' was a best-seller in 1978.
   O'Donnell was working on his second book about Hitler, to be
titled ``The Hitler Court,'' when he died.
   He was a 1939 graduate of Harvard University, and received a
master's degree in modern European history a year later.
   ``In Jim O'Donnell, it was impossible to distinguish between the
journalist and the contemporary historian,'' said university
President John R. Silber.
   He was a professor in residence at the university since 1985,
living in a student dormitory until his death.
   O'Donnell is survived by his wife and two sisters.

   A jailhouse journalist serving a life
sentence for cutting a bank teller's throat and shooting two others
after a holdup again is vying for freedom, but the governor said
Tuesday the inmate is wasting his time.
   Inmate Wilbert Rideau has gained fame as the editor of the
award-winning Angolite, the Louisiana State Penitentiary magazine,
but that hasn't helped his attempts at freedom.
   In December 1988, Gov. Buddy Roemer rejected the Louisiana
Pardon Board's recommendation of clemency for Rideau, who's been
locked up for 29 years.
   Asked if he had changed his mind, Roemer said: ``At this moment,
I have not.''
   On Wednesday, Rideau intends to make his seventh request for
clemency before the pardon board.
   Rideau, 48, was sentenced to die in the electric chair for the
murder of Gulf National Bank teller Julia Ferguson after an armed
robbery in the southwest Louisiana town of Lake Charles in 1961.
   Rideau, then 19, used a pistol to get away with $14,279 stuffed
into a suitcase. He forced two tellers and the branch manager, all
of whom he knew, into a car, drove them to a deserted road and shot
all three. When Mrs. Ferguson begged for her life, Rideau cut her
throat and stabbed her in the heart. She was the only one who died.
   In 1973, his term was commuted to life in prison without parole
after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death penalty.
   Rideau's prison prose earned the Angolite and its editor
national acclaim, including the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award,
the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the George
Polk Award for special interest reporting.
   It also has allowed him to travel, with guards. Two weeks ago,
Rideau went to the American Society of Newspaper Editors' meeting
in Washington, D.C., to speak about prison journalism.
   He says he has offers of journalism jobs if he can get out of
prison. But he worries that his case attracts so much attention it
puts extra pressure on the governor.
   In 1984, the pardon board voted to cut Rideau's sentence to time
served. But then Gov. Edwin Edwards rejected clemency. Two years
later, the board voted to cut Rideau's sentence to 60 years, but
Edwards refused to sign the release.
   In 1988, a newly appointed board affirmed the 60-year sentence,
but Roemer turned Rideau down. Each time, the governor cited strong
objections from survivors of the crime.
   When Rideau presents his appeal this time, he will back it up
with a study from Loyola University in New Orleans that raises the
issue that he is black and the victim was white.
   The ``Rideau Report,'' as it is called, says every black man
convicted of murdering a white person in Calcasieu Parish over an
88-year period was sentenced to death when capital punishment was
an option. Lake Charles is the Calcasieu Parish seat.
   Linda LaBranche, an assistant professor of English, said only 26
percent of 101 Calcasieu Parish murder convictions between 1889 and
1976 resulted in death sentences. However, all 13 black men
convicted of killing whites were condemned to death.
   ``The fact that a death sentence was given to every single black
man convicted of murdering a white in Calcasieu Parish from the
parish's earliest recorded history to a full 15 years after the
1961 conviction of Rideau points decidedly to a separate and
unequal system of justice which existed for offenders in this
category,'' LaBranche said.
   Rideau's appearance before the board comes two days after the
U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution of a retarded
man for the 1977 murder of a Louisiana state trooper. The court
listed a stay of execution it granted four months ago and voted 7-2
Monday to deny the appeals by Dalton Prejean, 30, who has been on
death row since 1978, longer than any other inmate in Louisiana.
   No new execution date was set for Prejean, who was less than
eight hours away from the electric chair in November when the high
court granted the stay and agreed to consider his case.

   Employees of the Department of
Education catnap in the darkened corners while their supervisor
moves her desk closer to the window to work in the sunlight.
Problem: no electricity.
   At the main ticketing office of Philippine Airlines, would-be
travelers lounge on the stairs waiting until the power returns so
airline employees can process their tickets.
   Such scenes are repeated daily in this tropical city of 8
million people, who are enduring a grave electricity crisis during
the hottest season of the year.
   The shortage has become so critical that the government has
announced a limited four-day work week starting next Monday for
state offices and buildings that use more than 100 kilowatts a day.
   Infrastructure problems are nothing new to Filipinos, who must
cope with a haphazard telephone system, chaotic traffic, potholed
streets and an unreliable water system.
   In November, the city went through a similar power crisis that
abated after a failed coup the following month. But with demand
increasing in the torrid summer months, the daily ``brownouts'' are
back in fury.
   Nothing illustrates the collapse of infrastructure during
President Corazon Aquino's 4-year-old administration more
graphically than the electricity crisis. It is a problem that
affects virtually every household.
   Power is cut in commercial and residential districts for up to
eight hours a day. Perishable food spoils in refrigerators and
traffic snarls when stoplights fail.
   Without air conditioning, offices and homes turn to ovens as
temperatures hover near 100 degrees.
   In the city's entertainment district, scantily clad dancers at
one club perform their bumps and grinds in the sweltering darkness.
The club's generator can power the stereo but not the lights and
air conditioner.
   To make matters worse, Manila is also facing a critical water
shortage, due to a drought on Luzon island and the antiquated state
of the city's waterworks.
   Luis Sison, administrator of the Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System, says 40 percent of the water is being lost because
of leaks in the mains, some of which date back to 1892.
   Sison says renovation work began in 1987 but will not be
complete until mid-1992, when Mrs. Aquino's term expires.
   Earlier this month, the state-run National Power Corp.,
acknowledged that 12 of the 22 generating plants on Luzon island
were not working due to maintenance requirements, storm damage or
low water levels at hydroelectric dams. Those 22 plants generate
2,982 megawatts, of which 80 percent is consumed in greater Manila.
   Deogracias Peralta, vice president of the power corporation,
said plans call for using coal-fired and geothermal plants to
provide the foundation of the city's electricity system.
   But he said the system will not be fully operational until 1993.
   Critics blame the Aquino government for the crisis, which the
National Power Corp., had been predicting for three years.
   Under the late President Ferdinand Marcos, the government
contracted with the Westinghouse Corp. to build a 630-megawatt
nuclear power plant on the Bataan peninsula.
   The plant's capability was about the same as the shortfall in
generating capability. But Marcos' opponents alleged the plant was
unsafe and that Westinghouse paid bribes to win the contract.
Westinghouse denies both allegations.
   During the 186 election campaign against Marcos, Mrs. Aquino
vowed that if she were elected the plant would never operate. It
was a vow she kept.
   The presidential staff also stalled on proposals by the National
Power Corp. to buy expensive gas turbines as a short-term solution.
   Columnist Gabby Manalac recommended in The Business Star
newspaper that instead of power cuts and shortened work weeks, the
government mandate a comprehensive conservation plan, including
limiting use of air conditioners and outoor neon lighting.
   But in a country where many laws are only loosely enforced,
prospects for an effective energy-saving program appear dim.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Splits Candidates for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Democrats who would be Iowa's
governor parried and argued for 90 minutes, never mentioning the
word ``abortion.''
   But within hours, two of them cited the overwhelming need for
pro-choice activists to unite and joined forces in a single ticket.
   It was just one example of how candidates have struggled with a
political and emotional issue some admit they aren't quite sure how
to handle. Strategists argue about how the volatile abortion issue
will play in the Iowa campaign, but none dispute its standing on
the political agenda.
   ``It's playing out there,'' said Iowa Democratic Party spokesman
Joe Shannahan. ``People are talking about it at county
conventions.''
   There now are three major Democratic candidates running for the
nomination in the party's June 5 primary. The winner will take on
two-term Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who is seeking another
four-year term.
   Running are Attorney General Tom Miller, House Speaker Don
Avenson and retired Des Moines banker and longtime party activist
John Chrystal. The field was narrowed when Lt. Gov. JoAnn Zimmerman
dropped from the race to take the No. 2 spot on Avenson's ticket.
   Some pro-choice activists worry that Chrystal and Avenson will
slice up the pro-choice vote, and that anti-abortion forces will
cross over to vote for Miller in the primary, assuring that two
abortion foes are running in the fall election.
   At this time last year, the issue was seemingly settled. Miller,
a statewide officeholder for a dozen years, held a commanding lead
in the polls, in money and in a superior campaign organization.
   He's also a Roman Catholic with staunch anti-abortion views.
When the Supreme Court handed the issue back to the states last
summer, his standing in the polls began to slide.
   The most recent polls published by the Des Moines Register
showed Miller's support below the 35 percent needed to win the
nomination. If no candidate garners 35 percent, the Democratic
nominee would be selected in June by delegates to the party's state
convention.
   With less than two months to go before the primary, polls
indicate that roughly one-third of the Democrats planning to vote
still are undecided.
   ``Our concern out there is confusion,'' said Avenson. ``It's
difficult for pro-choice voters to make a decision.''
   Shannahan said the undecided group may be even larger.
   ``I'd say a clear majority haven't made up their mind, or are
willing to change their mind,'' he said. ``They haven't really
focused on who they're going to support.''
   Activists tired from years of marathon campaigning because of
Iowa's first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses are only now beginning
to return after an extended leave from politics, he said.
   The tenor of the campaign has shifted as well. In the early days
after the Supreme Court decision, the pro-choice candidates were
fond of showing up at rallies, waving coat hangers and trying to
outdo each other. They've stuck with their positions but toned down
the rhetoric.
   Miller said that shows the issue is cooling. ``Iowans are moving
beyond that issue,'' he said. ``Iowans are not single-issue
voters.''
   Branstad takes an anti-abortion position, although he has been
far from active. During the last legislative session, he asked for
no new restrictions and was vague about what he would sign.
   Although polls pitting Branstad against potential rivals have
him ahead, the governor's camp points to figures showing the state
has 548,000 registered Democrats, 476,000 Republicans and 474,000
voters who registered without expressing a party preference.
   ``When you know the other side can potentially turn out that
many more folks, you've got to be nervous,'' said David Roederer,
who runs Branstad's re-election effort. ``On any given day, if all
their folks show up and all your folks show up and nobody else
shows up, you probably won't win.''
   As a result, Branstad has turned his attention to piling up
money. He has raised more than $1.6 million, three times the
combined total of all the Democrats, who are spending their money
in the primary fight.

<HEAD>Lincoln, Jefferson Memorials Crumbling From `Toxic Effects of
Nature'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX7</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of Washington's most famous landmarks, the
Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, are slowly crumbling under the
ravaging effects of water seepage, air pollution, littering
tourists and a pesky little bug called the midge, experts say.
   Private consultants hired by the National Park Service say the
most glaring problem was found at the 68-year-old Lincoln Memorial,
where dripping rainwater has caused deterioration of huge concrete
slabs that support a broad cobblestone walkway and the grassy
terrace surrounding the building.
   At the Jefferson Memorial, completed in 1943, cracks have been
detected in the concrete shell of the inner dome. Officials also
are worried that the main plaza and marble steps may be sliding
gradually into the waters of the Tidal Basin.
   The Park Service said none of the problems is serious enough to
require immediate attention or pose a safety hazard to visitors.
   ``Both memorials are in excellent shape overall, and we want to
assure they stay that way,'' said assistant Park Service
superintendent Vikki McGraw. ``There is absolutely no danger to the
public.''
   Said Rebecca Stevens, historical architect for the Park
Service's national capital region: ``At this point, I'm sure they'd
be standing for another 200 years even if we did nothing.''
   Nevertheless, the team of outside architects and structural
engineers commissioned to make an exhaustive, $2 million study of
both monuments concluded that repairs must begin in the next few
years.
   ``The increasingly toxic effects of nature have begun to erode
this totally exposed monument,'' the consultants said in a report
issued after a year-long inspection. They were referring to the
Lincoln Memorial, but used nearly identical terms to describe the
Jefferson Memorial.
   ``If steps are not taken immediately to ... determine a specific
course of action, nature will continue to destroy this memorial,''
they said. ``Very serious structural problems exist right now.''
   Park Service officials say they hope to award a major repair
contract in 1993 after further tests. The consultants estimated
total costs at $12 million.
   The Lincoln Memorial attracted nearly 1.5 million visitors last
year, making it the second most popular national monument in
downtown Washington after the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, which
drew nearly 2.6 million tourists. The Jefferson Memorial was
visited by 924,000 people.
   This week officials started an experimental one-hour delay in
nighttime lighting of the Lincoln Memorial in an attempt to
discourage a messy infestation of midges, small winged insects that
breed in the muddy flats of the nearby Potomac River.
   Swarming into the air at dusk for mating, the midges are
attracted by the memorial's lights and smash into its limestone and
marble walls, splattering them with egg masses. The protein remains
of the midges attract spiders, which in turn lure sparrows and
starlings to the scene.
   As a result, Park Service crews must give the great marble
statue of Abraham Lincoln and adjacent walls and floors a daily
scrubbing.
   ``If we can solve the midge problem, we probably will go a long
way to solving the bird problem,'' said Ms. Stevens.
   The Park Service also has installed four electronic sensors in
the dome of the Jefferson Memorial to make hourly measurements of
the cracks in its concrete shell. The signals are radioed to a
computer in Texas to help scientists determine whether the cracks
are a symptom of the dome's instability or a natural response to
structural stresses.
   Ms. Stevens said the problem of bird deposits is compounded by
tourist droppings of food, chewing gum and especially carbonated
soft drinks, which have the corrosive effect of liquid acid on a
marble facade.
   The monuments also have suffered steadily from acid rain, jet
fuel exhaust from planes using National Airport, and the fumes from
tourist buses idling their engines in nearby parking lots.
   By far the greatest threat to the marble and limestone
buildings, Ms. Stevens said, is water _ rainwater, groundwater
rising from the former swampland on which the two memorials were
built and the water used to hose them clean.
   The eroding effects of water seepage appear most dramatically in
the dank, cavernous undercroft of the Lincoln Memorial. Curtains of
stalactites hang from cracks and joints in the ceiling, where the
crumbling concrete has exposed rusting reinforcing rods.
   Ms. Stevens said the Park Service has drastically reduced the
volume of water used to wash the monuments in recent years.
   ``We will need to educate the public to understand that these
buildings may not appear as pristine white in the future as they
once did, because we'll be using less water to clean them,'' she
said.

   Actress Polly Bergen, perhaps best known to
television audiences for her Emmy-nominated role as Rhoda in ``War
and Remembrance'' and the sequel ``The Winds of War,'' will file
for divorce, her publicist said Monday.
   Miss Bergen, 60, plans to end her eight-year marriage to New
York entrepreneur Jeffrey Endervelt, 50. Irreconcilable differences
were given as the reason for the split, according to publicist
Marilyn Reiss.
   Miss Bergan had planned to file court papers Monday, but was
called to a job out of state on short notice, Reiss said.
   ``She was told to get on a plane,'' the publicist said, adding
that the actress will probably file the divorce papers later this
month.
   Miss Bergen and Endervelt maintained homes on both coasts and
had no children, said Reiss.
   The actress was nominated for two Emmy Awards, one for ``The
Winds of War'' and the other for ``War and Remembrance.'' Rhoda was
the wife of naval officer Pug Henry in the miniseries.
   Miss Bergen was working in Louisiana on Monday on the CBS-TV
pilot ``Steel Magnolias,'' based on the movie, Reiss said.

   Fear on the Bronx streets where five cabbies
have been slain in the last five weeks is running so high that even
a rumor of another shooting led hundreds of drivers to tie up
traffic in protest.
   Between 400 and 500 of them parked their cabs in the street and
turned on their lights Monday afternoon after someone broadcast a
false report over their radios that another driver had been shot,
said police Officer Fred Weiner.
   Scores of drivers have quit, stayed home or refused to drive at
night because of the slayings, three of which have been described
by police as the work of a serial killer.
   ``This guy, he's freaking us out. I went to church to pray for
all my companions that nothing would happen to them,'' said driver
Randy Martinez.
   At the Seaman Car Service, employer of the latest victim, black
flags flew Monday from the antennas of cabs, and drivers held a
memorial procession.
   The latest attack, on Saturday, and another three days earlier
were dismissed by police as unrelated to the first three, but they
heightened fears in an area where cab drivers have not felt safe
for decades.
   In 1989, about half of the 32 cab driver killings citywide
occurred in the Bronx, police said.
   A task force of about 30 police officers has been assigned to
investigate. Mayor David Dinkins has offered a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the killers.
   The terror spree began March 7. In each of the first three
shootings, a man phoned a car service requesting a cab and then
killed the driver with a shot to the head from a .22-caliber gun
and robbed him.
   ``The first three are connected and the last two are not,'' said
Officer Ralph St. Just, a police spokesman. Police won't explain
exactly why.
   Some car service companies have lost up to 80 percent of their
drivers at night because of fear caused by the deaths, said Tony
Carter, spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which
licenses cabs in the city.
   Angel Bello, a dispatcher for Seaman, said dispatchers were
serving only regular customers or patrons who clearly know where
they are going. One-third of the Monday night workforce showed up,
he said.
   At the Flash Car Service Co., only 15 of the 80 drivers who
normally work Sunday nights showed, said dispatcher Pablo Feliciano.
   ``Most of them are switching to the days,'' he said. ``They're
really disturbed about what's going on. Everybody's shaken up
really badly.''

   First-grade student Chong Son-ah was killed Sunday after she and
a friend were accidently locked on a fire escape while playing at

<HEAD>Pediatricians Say Too Much TV Can Cause Childhood Obesity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA HALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too much TV can make children fat and more
violent, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.
   In its first policy statement on children and TV since 1984, the
39,000-member academy Monday that parents should cut their
children's TV viewing _ which averages as much as 23 hours a week _
at least in half.
   Heavy TV watching contributes substantially to childhood obesity
and is one cause of violent or aggressive behavior, the academy
said.
   Dr. Victor Strasburger, a member of the committee that prepared
the policy statement, complained TV offers ``a steady diet of
violence,'' causing some youngsters to believe ``that if you're the
good guy, violence can be acceptable'' to solve problems.
   Explaining the link to obesity, Strasburger, of the University
of New Mexico School of Medicine, said TV watching is a sedentary
activity, kids usually eat in front of the set, and ``the
nutritional messages on television are so terrible.''
   The policy statement credits a 1985 study by Drs. W.H. Dietz and
S.L. Gortmaker that appeared in the journal Pediatrics. Dietz, also
a committee member, has done follow-up research.
   The pediatricians said A.C. Nielsen Co. data indicate children 2
to 5 watch TV about 25 hours weekly; 6- to 11-year-olds, more than
22 hours weekly; and 12-to 17-year-olds, 23 hours weekly.
   By the time a child reaches 70, the doctors concluded, he or she
will have spent about seven years watching TV.
   ``For some children, the world shown on television becomes the
real world,'' the academy said.
   Among the academy's recommendations:
   _Limiting children's viewing to one to two hours a day and
developing activities such as reading, sports and hobbies.
   _Supporting legislation making high-quality children's shows a
condition of license renewal and mandating at least one hour per
day of educational programming.
   William Johnson, deputy chief of the Federal Communications
Commission's Mass Media Bureau, said networks have reduced TV
violence, with more characters negotiating to solve problems.
   In New York, CBS spokeswoman Anne Morfogen said the network had
not seen the academy's statement and had no comment. ABC and NBC
representatives had gone for the day or were otherwise unavailable
late Monday.

<HEAD>Broadway Producer Pleads Guilty to Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Broadway producer who raised money for such
hits as ``Hair,'' ``Lenny,'' and ``The Ritz'' pleaded guilty Monday
to stealing more than $400,000 in a fraudulent investment scheme.
   Adela Holzer, who falsely referred to herself as David
Rockefeller's secret wife and told victims he approved of the deals
she was promoting, was charged last year with stealing $4 million
from investors for fake oil, mineral and land deals.
   Under a plea bargain, Ms. Holzer will be sentenced to 4 to 8
years in prison instead of the 5 to 15 years she would have faced
had she been tried and convicted.
   Sentencing was set for May 10. She could be eligible for parole
in two years and 10 months.
   Ms. Holzer, who was convicted 11 years ago of stealing $77,500
from investors, entered her plea before Acting Justice Richard D.
Carruthers.
   Carruthers told her that Monday was her last chance to work out
a plea bargain and that any future pleas would have to be to all 10
counts in the indictment. Her trial had been sent for May 7.
   Ms. Holzer said ``yes'' when asked if she was pleading guilty to
one charge: the theft of more than $400,000 from an investor, Kevin
Wirth.
   She refused to tell the judge her age, saying she would only
reveal it to the court clerk in private. She is believed to be in
her late 60s.
   Ms. Holzer successfully raised money for a number of Broadway
shows.
   Detectives said she had used at least two fictitious names and
had referred to herself as Rockefeller's secret wife at social
events.
   She persuaded a number of people to invest by leading them to
believe that Rockefeller thought she was offering a good deal. She
placed a photograph of Rockefeller beside her bed in her East Side
apartment.
   Rockefeller, retired chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said
he never met Ms. Holzer.

<HEAD>Inspector General Says No-Bid Contracts Legal But Loosely
Monitored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is ordering a new
housing board to adopt strict contracting procedures after an
internal investigation determined that three no-bid contracts were
awarded legally, but poorly.
   Kemp announced the action Monday after Paul A. Adams, inspector
general of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said
the Federal Housing Finance Board contracts provided necessary work
but were not well administered.
   In a memo to board director Mary K. Bush, Kemp asked that eight
recommendations Adams made in his report on the contract
investigation be implemented immediately. They include establishing
written, competitive contracting guidelines; hiring a chief
contracting officer and adopting policies for employee ethics and
hiring of outside consultants.
   Kemp, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the report
``puts to rest any suggestions that there was inappropriate
conduct.'' He said he was ``not particularly pleased'' with the
possible appearance of impropriety raised by the no-bid contracts
Ms. Bush gave friends but that he stood by her.
   At the same time, he said he was temporarily assigning a HUD
attorney to the board as ``my administrative assistant or executive
assistant for two or three months.''
   Kemp effectively controls the finance agency because he is the
only named member of its five-member board. He recruited Ms. Bush
with the promise she would be nominated board chairwoman, but two
weeks ago she agreed to be the agency's managing director after
being told she would not be nominated. She had been serving as
acting director.
   The agency, created as part of last year's savings and loan
bailout legislation, oversees the 12 regional Federal Home Loan
Banks and controls up to $100 million a year in housing funds.
   Aides said Kemp asked for the contracts review in mid-March
immediately after HUD officials became aware of the no-bid
contracts Ms. Bush awarded to friends with whom she served in the
Reagan administration. They included Wendell Gunn, who later served
for several months as Kemp's HUD chief of staff.
   But an internal HUD memo obtained later by the AP showed that
HUD Undersecretary Alfred A. DelliBovi was aware that Gunn was
being paid by the agency in early February. DelliBovi's memo
mentioning payments to Gunn was sent to six Kemp aides, including
his two top deputies.
   The memo was not addressed to Kemp and aides have said he did
not see it. But Kemp acknowledged Monday that he should have called
in Adams to investigate sooner.
   ``I admit that we should have jumped on this in February,'' Kemp
said. ``Was I late? Yes.''
   Kemp said he was aware months ago that Gunn had been helping Ms.
Bush get the finance agency up and running, but ``I thought it was
more informal than formal. ... I did not know about the process or
the contract, but I assumed that we were following the right
procedure.''
   Kemp was not specific but his comments indicated, contrary to
statements by aides, that he became aware of the Gunn contract
before the other two contracts.
   ``Whether I did it too late or too early is perhaps subject to
criticism, but I don't think that (the Gunn contract) alone
required me to call for an investigation. He is an honorable
person,'' the HUD secretary said.
   Kemp said he called for the review after learning that one of
the no-bid contracts went to attorney Margery Waxman, a former
Treasury Department official who represented Charles Keating in his
then-successful 1988 effort to convince regulators not to seize his
California savings and loan.
   In a letter to Keating released by a congressional committee,
Waxman said she had pressured regulators into accepting Keating's
positions. The subsequent failure of Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan is expected to cost taxpayers some $2.5 billion.
   ``The Waxman letter and her connection to Keating ran the flag
up,'' Kemp said. ``Whether it is late or early, the fact is that
the IG (inspector general) report says there was nothing wrong in
hiring these people.''
   Adams said in his report that Gunn, Waxman and the third
recipient of a no-bid contract, the consulting firm of McKinsey &amp;
Co., all provided necessary and beneficial work to the housing
board, which Adams said was short-staffed in late 1989 when Ms.
Bush awarded the contracts.
   But Adams said poor management by Housing Finance Board
officials allowed the consultants to work without signed agreements
and with little oversight from agency officials.
   The three contracts totaled nearly $200,000. Adams questioned
only $937 of that. He said Waxman's law firm, Sidley &amp; Austin,
could not support $426 in billed copying services and had
improperly charged the board $511 for work related to its contract
negotiations with the agency.

   Millions of taxed procrastinators on Monday rustled their
receipts, coaxed their calculators and battered aspirin bottles
before doing the annual tax deadline dash to the post office.
   But Tax Day 1990 was marred by violence. Outside a post office
in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Mich., a bomb inside an
envelope addressed to ``tax thieves'' exploded, injuring a postal
worker, officials said.
   The worker, who'd been collecting last-minute tax returns, was
treated at a hospital and released. Federal law enforcement
officers were investigating.
   From Olympia, Wash., where a piano player was set up at the main
post office to serenade the frantic; to long lines in Philadelphia,
taxpayers grappled with Tax Day _ April 16, a day later than usual
because the 15th fell on a Sunday.
   ``... It's a zoo and circus combined _ that's what it's like
tonight,'' said Decatur, Ga., Postmaster Crawford Lovett, who was
helping collect tax returns from motorists outside the post office.
``This is just fun.''
   A group of about 15 or 20 tax protesters, carrying signs
indicated they were against the use of tax revenues to finance
nuclear weapons, paraded outside the post office at one point,
Lovett said.
   ``Tonight's a gorgeous night. And the attitude of the people is
almost like it's the right thing to do,'' he said of last-minute
filers. ``It's as if they have a civil right to procrastinate and
they're just exercising their right.''
   The IRS did not estimate how many couples and individuals waited
until the last minute. But the agency predicted that about 34
million returns _ more than 30 percent of the 111 million expected
this year _ would be filed after April 6.
   The IRS Form 4868 was one of the most-sought pieces of paper in
the nation Monday as an estimated 6 million Americans abandoned
hopes of meeting the midnight deadline. Filing a Form 4868, along
with a check for estimated taxes owed, extends the return deadline
to Aug. 15.
   Michigan's top tax man, state Treasurer Robert Bowman, was among
the procrastinators Monday.
   ``Morning services, Easter egg hunts and taxes: that's how I
spent my weekend,'' Bowman said. ``It proves beyond a shadow of a
doubt that we are a nation of procrastinators.
   ``I always wait until the last minute to do my own taxes,
because I spend the first three months of the year worrying about
everyone else's,'' Bowman said. ``But I always get a refund.''
   In Olympia, Wash., a piano player was stationed at the main post
office Monday night. Coffee and cookies also were being offered.
   It's the second year they have had the festivities. ``We had so
much fun last year that we decided to do it again this year,'' said
Postmaster Michael Loe.
   In New York City, several hundred people milled around outside
the main post office in midtown Manhattan, and hundreds more were
outside.
   Dozens of people stood on lines, while others sat in chairs set
up for the occasion, filling out forms with calculators in hand.
Traffic was backed up for blocks as people double-parked to mail
their forms and rubber-necked at the commotion. Others sprinted up
the front steps, forms in hand.
   ``We're expecting a minimum of 15,000'' people, said Postal
Service spokeswoman Diane Todd. ``That's compared to an average
daily figure of 3,000 to 4,000.''
   Actress Meg Carpenter, 31, explained, ``I want to keep my money
as long as I can.''
   In Philadelphia, taxpayers lined up outside an IRS office for
last-minute help and the processing center braced for the arrival
of millions of returns from the Eastern seaboard.
   ``Today is crazy,'' said Jim Wondolowski, spokesman for the
Philadelphia office. ``We had people lined up and out the door
before we opened the door. They were here for last-minute questions
and actual preparation. The majority are coming in to have their
taxes prepared.''
   Luckily, Tax Freedom Day isn't far off. That's the hypothetical
day _ as calculated by the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation _
on which all federal, state and local taxes would be paid if all
income were earmarked for taxes.
   The Tax Foundation said the average person would have to work
125 days in 1990 _ through May 5 _ to pay all taxes.
   And procrastinators in New England and New York state were given
another day to wait. They file their returns to the IRS claims
office in Andover, Mass., where Monday was Patriots' Day, a holiday
in Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Most U.S. Cropland Involved in Rotation Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new report by the Agriculture Department
says most of the nation's cropland already is being farmed under
some kind of crop rotation program.
   One of the highly touted features of the administration's farm
bill proposal is more flexibility to allow farmers greater choice
in what to plant without losing commodity program benefits.
   Advocates also say flexibility would permit more crop rotation
and the advantages of natural fertility enhancement instead of high
reliance on commercial fertilizers and other chemicals.
   According to a report in the April issue of Farmline magazine,
USDA economists Stan Daberkow and Mohinder Gill studied the
three-year rotations of seven major crops ``because there is
concern that continuous cropping is a prevalent practice'' among
farmers.
   ``Such monoculture farming may require the use of agricultural
chemicals to replace essential crop nutrients in order to achieve
steady yields year to year,'' the report said.
   On the average, 80 percent or more of the land in major field
crops in 1988 was included in a crop rotation plan using five to 10
cropping patterns over a three-year period. In some states,
however, only two or three cropping patterns were used.
   ``The exception is cotton,'' the report said. ``About 50 percent
of the 1988 cotton acreage had been used continuously for that crop
for at least three years.''
   Rotation with soybeans, alfalfa and other legumes increases the
nitrogen content of the soil, providing a natural fertilizer. Also,
the report noted, plant diseases, insects and weeds can be reduced
by not planting the same crop year after year. And that cuts back
on the need for pesticides.
   Crop rotations can help protect the soil from erosion and
moisture losses, and the soil's organic matter and water-holding
capacity may also be increased, the report said.
   Daberkow and Gill also found good economic reasons for rotating
crops. Soil fertility and preservation can contribute to higher
yields and a chance for larger profits. Moreover, different
combinations of crops can help reduce risks.
   ``But despite the benefits attributed to crop rotations, about
20 percent of U.S. farmland is continuously planted with the same
crop,'' the report said. ``In some areas, alternative crops are not
feasible because of climate conditions.''
   It added: ``In other cases, planting in rotations is not
economically sound because of investments in equipment and
expertise.''
   The Daberkow-Gill study looked at three-year cropping patterns
on land used for corn, winter and spring wheat, soybeans, rice,
fall potatoes and cotton.
   Most cropland was involved in some type of rotation during the
previous two years, the report said. Exceptions were the 1988 crops
of cotton in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi; irrigated
corn in Nebraska, winter wheat in Oklahoma, soybeans in Mississippi
and rice in California.

   An Auburn University scientist has been given
permission by the Agriculture Department to conduct field tests of
cabbage and broccoli that have been genetically engineered to glow.
   Officials said Monday a permit has been issued to Joseph Shaw,
an assistant professor of botany and microbiology, to begin the
tests this month in Macon County, Ala.
   Shaw transferred a set of genes having a code for
bioluminescence from a marine organism into bacteria that causes
black rot, a major disease of plants in the cabbage and broccoli
family.
   After infecting plants with the luminescent black rot bacteria,
the diseased plant parts will glow, allowing scientists to trace
the progress of the disease through the plant.
   One of the benefits of the process will be the observation of
the disease's progress without destroying the plants, Shaw said in
a report released here.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, which issued the permit, said a
review showed the proposed field tests ``will pose no agricultural
or human hazard.''
   In nature, the microorganism _ Vibrio fischeri _ enjoys a
``symbiotic relationship with fish, for which it produces light,''
the agency said. ``Scientists suspect the fish use the glowing
microorganisms to communicate with each other.''

   Milk production in the first three months of
1990 was up about 1 percent from the first quarter of 1989,
according to the latest Agriculture Department figures.
   The U.S. total was reported Monday at about 36.9 billion pounds
in the first quarter, compared with less than 36.5 billion pounds a
year earlier.
   In the 21 major dairy states, which account for about 85 percent
of the U.S. total, output was reported at 31.3 billion pounds. The
number of cows on farms was shown at 8.51 million head, down 27,000
from a year earlier.
   The average milk output per cow in the 21 states was 1,291
pounds in March, up 23 pounds from March 1989.
   Department analysts forecast U.S. milk production this year may
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last year's 144.3 billion pounds.
   ``The high milk prices of late 1989 and early 1990 have provided
a financial boost to dairy farmers and a stimulus to production,''
says the department's Economic Research Service.

<HEAD>Joint US-Soviet Mission to Mars Too Risky, Committee Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans and Soviets don't know each other
well enough yet to explore Mars together and it would be too risky
to attempt such a joint venture now, a new study says.
   ``The United States and U.S.S.R. have no prior experience with
the degree of cooperation necessary to carry out a technical
project of this complexity or magnitude,'' a committee of the
National Research Council reported Monday.
   The two countries don't have a history of cooperation,
relatively few lines of communication and little knowledge of the
other's technical and management practices, the report said.
   ``The demonstrated stability of the relationship is such as to
at least raise concerns at this time about relying on the
consistency of the relationship over a period of a decade or more
into the future,'' it added.
   In view of those risks, the panel recommended instead that the
two nations follow ``a graceful path'' of coordinated but
independent exploration. That, it said, would lead to increasingly
close levels of cooperation.
   The report appeared to chill the idea frequently advanced by
space experts that Mars be explored jointly by the Soviets and
United States, using robotic vehicles that would scoop up soil and
rocks and bring them to Earth for study.
   There have been suggestions that the two nations share the cost
and technical requirements of four to six such missions.
   One scenario often mentioned is that one nation would build a
lander and a sample-return vehicle, while the other would develop a
roving vehicle for collecting samples and analyzing them.
   The committee said it reached its conclusions after considering
these three levels of U.S. participation with the Soviets in a Mars
venture:
   _Each country conducting programs independently.
   The cost would be too high, the returns would be less than
maximum, U.S. technology would benefit greatly and there would be
no additional risk of transferring technology to the Soviets, the
committee said.
   That approach also could ``ignite a space competition similar to
the race to the moon,'' it said.
   _Split responsibilities and joint technical operations.
   ``A commitment by both nations to a fully cooperative venture
... would have a greater, presumably positive impact on U.S.-Soviet
relations than would options involving lesser degrees of
interactions and reliance,'' the committee said.
   Such a venture would allow the nations to share costs while
increasing returns and to take advantage of the best of both
nations' space programs, such as the Soviets' lead in heavy-lift
launch capability.
   But a mission highly dependent on cooperative efforts would be a
``potential hostage to political events that might disrupt
communications and interaction between the two nations,'' said the
committee.
   _A highly coordinated exploration program.
   ``The two sides would work together at all stages,'' said the
report. ``However, the two sides would conduct their own
self-contained and independently designed missions.''
   There would be cooperation in analyzing samples and the cost
would be cut in half because each side would need to commit to only
half of the needed missions, said the committee. And ``there would
be no risk of mission failure due to technical, management or
political failures.''
   Thee is a danger that the cooperation could ``deteriorate into a
race for Mars,'' the committee said, but the competition might even
be helpful if the schedule is planned and paced properly.
   The National Research Council conducts studies for the National
Academy of Sciences, a congressionally chartered organization.

<HEAD>Most Brazilians Support Economic ``Shock'' Plan, But Criticism
Grows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To DELETE extraneous word, SUB 9th graf, `On Monday ...'
Picks up 10th, `The plan ...'

<TEXT>
   A solid majority of Brazilians
support the government's crash economic plan, which has brought
inflation down from a record 5,000 percent but also cost hundreds
of thousands of people their jobs.
   ``I couldn't go on the way it was before. With inflation down,
I've got at least a little bit of money in my pocket,'' said
Denilson Goncalves, who sells baked goods on the street of a
middle-class neighborhood in Rio.
   Goncalves' views were reflected in a public opinion poll
conducted last week in Brazil's 10 largest cities that indicated 71
percent approval. Conducted by the prominent Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper, it surveyed 5,291 people and had a 2 percent margin of
error.
   But support for the plan has dropped 10 percent from a similar
survey conducted three weeks ago, reflecting a growing concern over
a rapid rise in unemployment.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello initiated the plan on March
16, a day after taking office. Its heart is an 18-month freeze on
bank accounts with more than the equivalent of $1,200, and a limit
on money market withdrawals to $600 or 20 percent of the account,
whichever is greater.
   The move took an estimated $115 billion out of circulation
overnight and sent the economy into a tailspin, with the
automobile, construction, and other industries virtually paralyzed.
   Collor said the measures were drastic, but necessary, to bring
down inflation that reached nearly 5,000 percent over the past year.
   On Monday, Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said prices
have fallen over the last month and that the plan has already
resulted in an increase in real wages of up to 18 percent.
   The plan has been especially popular with the poor of this
country of 150 million people, who were not directly hit by the
bank freeze. It has been most harshly criticized by the wealthy,
who have seen their savings frozen.
   But anger is also growing among the working class as well. An
estimated 1 million Brazilians have been fired, taken steep salary
cuts, or been put on collective holiday since the plan was
announced.
   ``What good is low inflation if I don't have money to buy
anything?'' asked Aloisio Porfilho Reyes, who was laid off in late
March as a security guard.
   Reyes, 47, said he doesn't know how he will feed his wife and
five children.
   ``Before Collor's plan we had terrible inflation, but at least I
had a paycheck evey week,'' he said, as he waited in a long line at
the Labor Ministry in downtown Rio to apply for unemployment
benefits.
   Rosangela Jesus de Oliveira, 28, echoed Reyes' sentiments.
``Everybody is getting laid off and when the boss fires you, all he
ever says is Collor, Collor, Collor.''
   Ms. Oliveira arrived at the Labor Ministry at 6 a.m. to register
for unemployment benefits, but found that 500 people were already
waiting before her.
   ``This president of ours is going to kill the poor with
hunger.'' she said.
   Economics Minister Cardoso has said the government will use some
of the money in blocked bank accounts to help industries that were
hard hit by the economic plan. She said a special credit line of
$500 million has already been set up for the construction industry.
   But almost all economists say that will not be enough to prevent
a steep recession.
   Said Economist Edmar Bacha: ``A recession is inevitable _ its
duration will depend on the government's future conduct of economic
policy. But I would not be surprised to see a 20 percent drop in
industrial production over the next three months.''
   He said the harsh measures were necessary to curb inflation.
   Some people fear that a steep recession would worsen income
inequalities in this country where the richest 1 percent holds
wealth equal to that of the poorest 50 percent and most people live
on less than $200 a month.
   But many believe that Collor's plan will nevertheless remain
popular, even if there is a dramatic economic downturn.
   ``If inflation stays low, most Brazilians will be happy. The
unemployed will make a lot of noise, but they'll only account for a
small percentage of the population, even in a worst-case
scenario,'' said Rep. Cesar Maia, an economic spokeman for the
center-left Democratic Labor Party.

   National Geographic magazine has a new editor
following the abrupt departure of Wilbur E. Garrett, who guided the
publication's content for a decade.
   Neither Garrett nor the magazine would say on Monday whether he
had been fired.
   Garrett was replaced by William T.E. Graves, 63, who has been a
senior member of the magazine's editorial staff for 12 years.
   Garrett said there had been some ``personality conflicts'' and
some differences of opinion at the magazine, but he would not
elaborate on the circumstances of his sudden departure.
   ``I think it's one of those situations which is not really quite
explainable yet,'' Garrett said when reached at his Virginia home.
   Nobody at the magazine or the National Geographic Society tried
to explain it.
   ``All I can say is what I've said, is that he's leaving,'' said
Robert Sims, a National Geographic spokesman.
   Asked whether Garrett quit or was fired, Sims, who had a long
statement on the change in editors, replied only: ``I really don't
have anything on that.''
   Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic
Society and chairman of its board, issued a statement praising both
Garrett and Graves. It gave no indication of conflicts at the
publication.
   ``Bill Garrett has given his heart and soul to the National
Geographic Society for the past 35 years,'' Grosvenor said. ``Every
member of the society and every reader of our magazine has
benefited from his great enthusiasm for dispensing knowledge. We
will miss him.''
   Grosvenor said Graves ``has the experience and respect of his
peers within the society and the world at large to do a topflight
job right from the start.''
   Graves became the eighth editor in the 102-year history of the
publication that has explored the world and the creatures that
inhabit it. The magazine is sent to the 10 million members of the
National Geographic Society.
   Sims said Garrett's departure and Graves' promotion took effect
immediately.
   Graves said he was ``honored at the opportunity and the
challenge presented by this appointment.''
   Graves first joined the magazine in 1956 and has written
numerous articles for it as well as a book on Hawaii.
   Garrett said that he still has ``a deep affection for the
Geographic.''
   For decades the magazine was known for its avoidance of
controversy as much as for the exotic locale of its feature
articles, but in recent years it has tried to run more articles on
newsworthy topics.

   Anchorman John Criswell legally can't open his

   KDFW-TV ran a picture of Criswell's mouth taped shut as part of
an advertising blitz.
   ``Until we can give you Criswell live, you'll have to settle for
Criswell taped,'' the ads say.
   Criswell left top-ranked WFAA, where he has worked 19 of the

at his new station until June 1 _ the day after the spring ratings
``sweeps'' end.
   Under the settlement of Criswell's contract obligations, WFAA
also barred his new employers from using Criswell or his voice in
any TV ads.
   Forced to improvise, KDFW General Manager Jeff Rosser said the

   Donald Trump's lawyers say because Ivana Trump
has no plans to get a divorce, she is not entitled to have a court
decide what she would get in the likelihood of one.
   The mega-rich couple has been living apart since Feb. 11.
   Mrs. Trump's attorneys have said she has no intention of ending
her 13-year marriage. But last month she sued to invalidate a 1987
postnuptial agreement under which she would get $10 million and the
couple's $12 million mansion in Greenwich, Conn.
   Court papers filed Monday by her husband's lawyers deny Mrs.
Trump's assertion that she is entitled to a bigger share of Trump's
estimated $5 billion fortune.
   State law calls for equitable distribution of all assets
acquired during marriage when a couple divorces, but Trump claims
that his wife gave up that right in the 1987 agreement.
   Mrs. Trump claims her husband intimidated her and ``verbally
assaulted'' her to get her to sign the agreement.

<HEAD>$9.1 Billion Plant Gets Full-Power License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comanche Peak, the $9.1 billion nuclear power
plant troubled by a decade of delays, can now begin moving toward
commercial operations under a full-power license from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   The five-member NRC, in a unanimous vote Monday, granted the
license despite a last-minute attempt by opponents who complained
that evacuation procedures failed to account for a summer
population of children attending church camps in the area of the
plant and that permanent residents of the area about 80 miles
southwest of Dallas were not adequately informed of potential
dangers.
   Erle Nye, chairman and chief executive office of TU Electric,
said the plant could begin producing power for commercial use by
summer.
   The plant won an NRC license two months ago to load fuel and
begin low-power operations. Testing has been going on since under
the low-power license, which had limited the 1,150-megawatt Unit 1
reactor to operating at 5 percent of capacity.
   Comanche Peak would be the second _ and likely the last _ plant
this year to receive a full-power operating license from the NRC,
said NRC spokesman Frank Ingram. The commission last month awarded
the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire a
full-power license.

<HEAD>State Department Says Steel Products Being Imported from South</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Africa
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration acknowledges it is
allowing South African iron and steel into the United States
despite a 1986 economic sanction designed to force an end to
apartheid, the State Department said Monday.
   However, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
Monday that most of the controversial imports are ferroalloys,
strategic commodities never intended by Congress to be banned under
the law.
   She said the administration's definition of steel was upheld in
a federal court in 1987 and that certain prefabricated products
that contain steel are not included in the definition of steel.
   ``This administration will continue to enforce fully all
provisions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said. ``This is an old issue that has been thoroughly reviewed by
the Treasury Department.''
   A Treasury Department official told The Associated Press on
Monday that ferroalloys were always outside the scope of the law
and that the department had intended to screen out prefabricated
products containing steel.
   However, the official said, the appeals court for the court of
international trade, ruled against the department. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said such imports were ``very
minor,'' about 1 percent of the volume of ferroalloys. ``Our
enforcement is very strict,'' the official said. ``There is no
reason for alarm.''

<TEXT>
   In a forceful speech before an ecstatic crowd at a
televised anti-apartheid rock concert, Nelson Mandela asked
millions of people in 40 countries to step up pressure on South
Africa's government.
   Chants of ``Nelson, Nelson, Nelson'' punctuated nearly seven
minutes of deafening cheers when the 71-year-old black leader
strode triumphantly onto the Wembley Stadium stage near the end of
Monday's five-hour concert.
   He raised his arm in the famous clenched-fist salute of his
African National Congress and a sea of fists rose in response.
Cries of ``Amandla!'' (Power!) rang through the crisp night.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, and Adelaide Tambo, wife of ANC
President Oliver Tambo, stood quietly on either side of Mandela as
he spoke to the largest audience he has addressed since his release
from a South African jail Feb. 11.
   He declared the day one of ``re-dedication to the continuation
and intensification of the struggle for the emancipation of all the
remaining political prisoners'' in South Africa, imploring the
world to keep up the struggle to dismantle the system that denies
the country's black majority the vote.
   ``The apartheid crime against humanity remains in place. It
continues to kill and maim. It continues to oppress and exploit,''
he said.
   Mandela spoke for nearly a half hour, his words interrupted
about 30 times by cheers and applause.
   He urged that economic sanctions be kept in place and that South
Africa's white-led government not be rewarded for releasing
political prisoners or lifting the ban on the ANC, the leading
anti-apartheid group.
   The British media took his comments as veiled criticism of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who opposes sanctions.
   Mandela said the struggle to end apartheid and transform South
African into a ``non-racial democracy'' can only be realized ``as a
result of struggle, including the struggle represented by the
international sanctions campaign.'' Anti-apartheid sentiment was
wound up for more than four hours prior to Mandela's appearance by
an international lineup of rock and jazz musicians performing
political pop.
   The British reggae band Aswad opened with ``Mandela's back in
town,'' followed by Patti Labelle's ``Oh People,'' the Neville
Brothers ``My Blood,'' Neil Young's ``Keep on Rockin' in the Free
World,'' Jackson Browne and Johnny Clegg harmonizing in ``One
(Hu)Man One Vote,'' and numbers by Grammy-winner Bonnie Raitt,
Natalie Cole, Anita Baker and a dozen others.
   Tracy Chapman sang before Mandela's appearance and once again
afterward, delivering a moving, solo version of ``Talkin' Bout a
Revolution.''
   The concert sold out in two days. Among those who paid $33 to
attend were former U.S. presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and
Neil Kinnock, leader of Britain's opposition Labor Party.
   Concert organizers said part of the proceeds would go to
charities, including Oxfam and Save The Children Fund. They gave no
estimate because the sale of television rights was still under way.
   In an earlier news conference, Mandela said he came to Britain
to thank those had pressured South Africa for his release.
   About 90 minutes after his appearance at the concert, Mandela
left London on a flight to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He arrived Sunday
at London's Heathrow Airport in a bulletproof limousine, guarded by
police with machine guns.

   After losing an election to a pro-U.S.
coalition, the leftist Sandinista Front still seems far from
collecting its consolation prize _ the quick dismantling of the
Contra rebels.
   But the Contras' reluctance to demobilize, which they insist
stems from a distrust of the Sandinistas but others call a grab for
power, might become their undoing.
   The United National Opposition, or UNO, is poised to assume
power on April 25 but could find itself starting its tenure with a
fresh outbreak of a war that seemed to be petering out after nine
years.
   The fabric of stability careful woven together by electoral
victor and vanquished seems on the brink of unraveling, just when
it seemed the processes of democratization and pacification were
nearly complete.
   ``The situation is grave, delicate and difficult because the
blood is still running, and there are threats of new political
explosions and a new escalation on the military field,'' outgoing
President Daniel Ortega said Monday as he met with evangelical
leaders.
   ``We are facing a real risk that we may get to April 25 and the
peaceful transition of power that we all have sought will not take
place.'' the man who lost February's general elections said later.
   UNO leaders have placed great emphasis on this being the first
time in national history that power is transferred to an opposition
government peacefully.
   However, as soon as UNO won the elections, most of the Contras
slipped across the border into Nicaragua, leaving behind in
Honduras only the wounded, the crippled and a few old guns.
   The move made more symbolic than effective a UNO-Contra accord
of March 23 under which Contra forces in Honduras are to demobilize
this week.
   Neither that accord nor another UNO-Contra pact reached April 9
made any mention of what had been a top demand of the U.S.-backed
Contras: that the Sandinista People's Army disarm and that the
officer corps be dismissed.
   That is what Contra chief of staff Israel Galeano, known as
Commander Franklin, is now again demanding as a condition for his
men to give up their weapons and return to civilian life under the
government of UNO President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in the elections, but I
think she will not be able to impose her authority on the
Sandinistas ... and if she doesn't, there won't be democracy in
Nicaragua,'' Galeano said in an April 11 interview with The
Associated Press in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   Galeano is now back in Nicaragua, and he has vowed to keep
fighting until his demand is met.
   For the Sandinistas, whose military commanders can remain in
place under a March 27 accord with UNO, the return of an estimated
9,000 Contras only means the prospect of more war.
   ``The fundamental problem here is that the Contras can't demand
to share in the power,'' said a well-placed Sandinista military
source speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They have to abide by
the agreements. They must demobilize.''
   This week, the pro-Sandinista press in Managua ran front-page
headlines predicting war and a muscle-flexing offensive by the
Contras to show they're still a force to be reckoned with.
   One diplomat, dismissing the Honduran demobilization set to
begin Wednesday as ``a farce,'' seemed to agree.
   ``This is the key week after so many months of talks, and the
situation this week is very, very dangerous,'' the diplomat said.
``Everything could go down the drain.''
   The UNO must search hard and fast for a compromise that will
allow the Sandinistas to feel safe from the Contras, while
acknowledging what the rebels feel they have contributed to UNO's
electoral victory.
   Failing that, the UNO government might find itself in the grips
of a strange irony: asking its Sandinista foes for help in stamping
out its Contra allies.

   The legal dance through the justice system is
over for students in this Ozarks hamlet who want to cut the rug at
their school but can't because of a 100-year-old ban on
high-steppin'.
   The U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday left intact the school
board's no-dancing rule.
   Opponents of the ban plan no appeal. The best they can hope for
is to elect school board members who are pro-dancing, said Howard
Fox, one of 21 students and parents who had sued four years ago in
an attempt to overturn the rule.
   The current board members ``are not going to be there forever,''
Fox said. ``Ultimately we will dance on their graves,
figuratively.''
   Most residents of the village of 900 were reluctant to discuss
the ruling. Many, including students at Purdy High School, just
shook their heads and walked away. Others, like Lois Dawn and Fox's
wife, Joan, had plenty to say.
   ``It's these new people who have moved in,'' Mrs. Dawn said of
several families who sued to overturn the ban. ``This is a Baptist
town. ... Who are these people to come in and inflict their views
on everyone else?''
   Mrs. Fox shook her head and sighed.
   ``We've lived in this town for 12 years and we're still
considered outsiders, mostly because we're Catholic,'' she said.
``It's an extreme victory for liars, cheats and hypocrites. I think
the judicial system in this country has gone to pot.''
   Mrs. Dawn graduated from 100-year-old Purdy High in 1957, when
the only kind of dancing allowed was in gym class.
   In 1986, the students and parents sued. A federal judge agreed
with them that the ban was motivated by fundamentalist ministers
fervently opposed to dancing and was thus a violation of separation
of church and state.
   The school board appealed, saying the ban had nothing to do with
religion. Meanwhile, students kicked up their heels at the first
dance at Purdy High School in 1988.
   Two more dances followed at the 230-student school, but the
future of school dances remains in question.
   Without comment, the Supreme Court let stand the 5-4 federal
appeals court ruling last fall that upheld the board's right to ban
dances.
   The board met in regular session Monday night, but
Superintendent Sheldon Buxton said a decision on whether to modify
or abandon the rule won't come until next month's meeting. He would
not speculate on what the board would do.
   ``This is not the time or place for the board to gloat,'' said
board President Glenn Garrett. ``It is time for the board,
administration, faculty, students and the Purdy citizens to set
about healing the divisions caused by this litigation.''
   Fox said pro-dancers triumphed whether the ban remains.
   ``There have been dances attended by orderly, well-behaved
students who had a wonderful time. No sex, drugs and alcohol like
some of the ministers preached. Taverns did not sprout on every
street corner,'' he said. ``Our point has been proven.''

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing Nikkei, dollar</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
its morning gains and dipped slightly Tuesday, while the dollar
edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 159.83 yen, up 0.41 yen from Monday's close
of 159.42 yen. The currency opened at 159.71 yen and ranged between
159.60 yen and 159.95 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 1.58 points, or 0.006
percent, ending the day at 28,461.60. The index, which on Monday
fell 750.74 points, or 2.57 percent, started lower and then
regained 349.65 points ending the morning session at 28,812.83.
   Traders attributed the index's afternoon losses to intermittent
index-linked sellings by securities firms.
   Masayoshi Shimoyama, a senior trader with Nikko Securities Co.,
said the index fell further toward the end of the afternoon session
as a wait-and-see mood grew in the market prior to a U.S. trade
figure announcement on Wednesday.
   In early trading, the index rose because the yen's stability
below the 160-yen level reasured participants, traders said.
   A dealer with Nomura Securities Co., said, however, ``there is
little positive reason to continue buying.''
   Participants were buying mainly in an attempt to prevent the
index from falling below 28,000 points, a level seen as a
psychological barrier, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The stock market is still very sensitive and nervous, although
we believe it has bottomed out,'' the dealer said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving steadily in
mixed trading, dealers said.
   Some investors were inclined to buy the dollar amid
uncertainties over developments in Lithuania, while other investors
sold the U.S. money for profit-taking, said Masato Hayashi, a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Friday threatened to
impose economic sanctions on Lithuania if the rebel Baltic republic
refuses to rescind controversial legislation passed since its
declaration of independence last month.
   Other dealers said that enough long, or overbought, dollar
positions have been built up as market players expect an
improvement in the U.S. trade balance.

   Homeowners' gardens and yards in the Gold
Rush town of Skagway will be vacuumed this month in a high-tech
spring cleaning aimed at removing lead from the soil.
   The work, which starts this week, is the final step in one of
Alaska's most expensive pollution cleanups.
   Extremely high levels of lead were discovered in 1988 in the
soil in Skagway, a shipping port for lead and zinc ore for decades.
But fears that the 700 residents were threatened by lead poisoning
were eased by the results of blood tests conducted by the state.
   State health officials concluded the lead posed no significant
threat. Blood lead levels in virtually all the residents tested
were below average. Officials explained that Skagway's lead is in a
raw form, which is not as easily absorbed into the body as
processed lead.
   Still, the state Department of Environmental Conservation
ordered lead levels in the soil reduced to within federal
standards. The first phase of the cleanup, in industrial areas, was
halted for winter in December but resumed last week.
   The residential cleanup begins this week, and the entire
operation may be completed by May, said Paul Taylor, vice president
of Alaska operations for White Pass Transportation Inc., which owns
the Skagway ore terminal.
   ``We want to get this whole lead thing wrapped up before tourist
season,'' Taylor said Sunday.
   Despite early problems with the cleanup, including several
violations of cleanup procedures and disagreements among the four
companies involved, the work has proceeded on time, said Dick
Stokes, DEC regional supervisor in Juneau.
   The companies estimate they've spent as much as $6 million on
the cleanup, and the state has spent about $175,000, Stokes said.
   ``It's probably been the largest non-oil cleanup in the state,''
Stokes said. ``I certainly think it's been the most complex, being
right in the middle of a town.''
   Preliminary results of follow-up soil tests in what were once
the most contaminated areas show lead levels below the limit of
1,000 parts per million, Stokes said. Before the cleanup,
concentrations were as high as 133,000 ppm.
   Much of the cleanup has employed large vacuum trucks that can
suck up soil several inches deep. The vacuum separates the fine,
lead-filled soil from the coarse soil. The ore then is filtered
through screens at the terminal and washed into holding ponds,
Taylor said.
   The lead that settles to the bottom will be recovered and the
water filtered.
   ``In the end we'll have a few thousand gallons of clean water
and a truckload of lead,'' Taylor said.
   The residential cleanup, unlike the industrial effort, is
optional. Property owners are being offered the services of the
vacuum-truck crews to get the lead out of their yards.
   ``We aren't planning to rip up any sidewalks or even tear up
established lawns,'' Stokes said. ``We'll try to target loose soils
in places where tracking would be the most significant.
   ``There hasn't been a whole lot of interest. I think we'll end
up with one or two dozen lots where we'll do some work.''
   Before the blood test results were announced last fall, DEC
officials had considered ordering an indoor cleanup of homes where
vacuum cleaner samples had shown high concentrations of lead. That
idea was rejected in light of the small health risk.
   ``It would be too expensive and too disruptive. It wasn't
justified,'' Stokes said.
   Instead the state has told residents to reduce their exposure to
the ore by increased handwashing, frequent damp mopping and
dusting, and avoiding tracking soil into their homes.
   Concern over the lead appears to have subsided in Skagway as it
prepares for summer, which every year brings thousands of tourists
on cruise ships and day excursions from Juneau, 92 miles to the
south.
   A group formed to monitor the cleanup, Get the Lead Out,
disbanded last week. And when the state held a public hearing on
the spring cleanup plans Wednesday, only about 20 people showed.
   Lynne Smith, a mother who has lived on and off in Skagway for 13
years, said the group's members were not fully satisfied with the
cleanup.
   ``But we've really gone through a lot in the last year,'' she
said, ``so we just have to decide what we will do in our own
individual lives as far as protecting our children.''

   Even the Easter holidays didn't stop
thousands of Poles from streaming into West Berlin _ some to shop,
others to sell goods in a muddy, littered field known as the
``Polish market.''
   The influx of Poles to West Berlin, one of the few Western
European destinations they can visit without visas, has increased
dramatically since the Polish zloty became convertible in January.
   More than a million Poles have visited since, West Berlin
officials say.
   Many head for the Polish market, a ragtag bazaar near central
Potsdamer Platz where Poles sell whatever they can bring from home.
   They cart to West Berln everything from caviar smuggled out of
the Soviet Union to farm fresh eggs and bacon, untaxed cigarettes
and Polish vodka.
   For Poles trying to weather their country's radical
transformation from a centrally planned to a free market economy,
the bazaar can be a crucial source of income.
   ``Who knows how long I'll have a job. I'm sure the company will
go bust by June,'' said Krzysztof Goral, a bus driver from Poznan,
as he tried to sell a pair of mounted deer antlers for 15 marks
($9.30).
   ``We've got to try to earn while we can,'' said his brother
Marek, an electrician, who watched over a pile of chocolates and
wooden-handled screwdrivers the brothers also had for sale.
   The Goral brothers are regulars at the Polish market.
   Every Friday, they take an evening train on the 205-mile trip to
East Berlin. Upon arrival, they stay up all night in order to avoid
a hotel bill, then cross into West Berlin to stake out a spot at
the market early in the morning.
   Many other Polish visitors sleep in their cars, tour buses or
try to camp in the Zoo train station.
   Those habits, along with the wide-open trading at the market,
appal many Berliners who would like the city government to do
something to stop the flow.
   Poles call it business; Germans call it smuggling and officials
have recorded more than 26,000 customs violations so far this year.
   Officials say the amount of confiscated goods, mostly from
Poles, is ``no longer conceivable,'' said the Berlin Morgenpost
newspaper. More than 1.5 million cigarettes have been confiscated
at the market since January, the newspaper reported.
   Despite the discomforts of travel and the threat of fines and
confiscation, many Poles find the market essential.
   ``Things are hard in Poland, I've got two kids and no job. I've
got to make a living,'' said Stanislaw Neuman of Wroclaw.
   Neuman lost his job last month as a bus driver as a part of the
economic ``shock therapy'' that ended state subsidies and has left
more than 200,000 people unemployed since taking effect Jan. 1.
   His blanket covered with Polish shaving creme, plastic combs,
used clothes and hand tools, Neuman hoped to earn a few marks that
can be exchanged for zlotys to be spent at home.
   Although Neuman was selling items for low prices, his mark-ups
would make many merchants envious. Among his goods was a comb that
he had bought for 1,000 zlotys (about 10 cents); he later sold it
for the equivalent of 3,000 zlotys.
   He also earned 13 marks ($7.75), nearly one-sixth of what he
earned each month as a bus driver, for a used pair of high heels
sold to a Turkish customer.
   Other Poles come to buy goods they then sell for a profit back
home at one of the thousands of open markets springing up across
Poland. But, facing customs restrictions, they may not tell you as
much.
   ``We don't have these kind of things in Poland,'' confided
Henryk Stachowicz, a coal miner from Zabrze, pointing proudly to
two new electronic keyboards he had just purchased.
   He said he could get 850,000 zlotys ($89) in Poland for each
keyboard, which he purchased for the equivalent of 660,000 zlotys
($69) apiece.
   Unshaven and dressed in wrinkled clothes, Stachowicz and the
other 36 passengers who paid 140,000 zlotys ($14.70) for a
round-trip bus ticket, slept in their tour bus in a West Berlin
parking lot rather than pay for a hotel.
   The coal miner denied he planned to resell the keyboards. He
also insisted he would never do business at the Polish market.
   ``Stand there and sell stuff. That's not for me. I have a job.
There is just nothing to buy in Poland,'' he said.

   An art gallery and its director pleaded
innocent to obscenity charges for exhibiting photos by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The written pleas were filed Monday in Municipal Court by the
Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie, who were
indicted April 7, the day the exhibit opened in this city that
styles itself a scourge against smut.
   Barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and
use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, both misdemeanors.
Barrie could be jailed for a year and fined $2,000. The gallery
could be fined $10,000.
   Defense attorney H. Louis Sirkin said the case may not go to
trial until after the Mapplethorpe exhibit ends its Cincinnati run
May 26. A federal judge has barred authorities from confiscating
the photos in the meantime.
   More than 25,000 people have viewed the 175-photo exhibit since
it opened. Seven of the photos, depicting naked children and
homosexual acts, are singled out in the indictments.
   An exhibit of the photos in Washington last year prompted
Congress to limit funds for the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., declared the photos obscene.
   Outside the courthouse Monday, about 25 people chanted and waved
signs in support of the center. One sign read: ``Myopic Politicians
Are Suffocating the People with Backward Social Structures.''
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in 1989 at age 42.

   Despite a merchants' strike that turned
Chinatown into a virtual ghost town, city supervisors have decided
to raze and rebuild an earthquake-damaged freeway rather than take
the quicker step of repairing it.
   The Board of Supervisors voted 6-5 Monday to replace the
two-mile, elevated Embarcadero Freeway, which led tourists into
Chinatown, North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf before the October
quake cracked its concrete towers.
   The vote was seen as a victory for Mayor Art Agnos, who wants to
build a sunken roadway that would cost $120 million and take at
least four years.
   Chinatown merchants had pressed instead for repairs, which state
officials said would cost an estimated $32 million and take just
six months.
   Most of Chinatown's 1,200 shops, restaurants and professional
offices had shut down Monday afternoon to protest plans to demolish
the Embarcadero. The City Hall hearing drew about 1,000 Chinatown
residents.
   ``This is the first time in 205 years the Chinese community has
shut down their businesses to protest,'' said protest organizer
Rose Pak of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
   The vote brought boos from people in the audience, including
many who came to City Hall in chartered buses and wore green
T-shirts that read, ``We Love the Embarcadero Freeway.''
   Merchants have complained their businesses have suffered since
the freeway was closed by the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that shook
Northern California on Oct. 17, killing 68 people. Deputy Mayor
James Ho estimated business is down by 8 percent; Pak put the drop
closer to 30 percent for tourist-dependent businesses and 20
percent for those relying on local residents.
   The freeway, built in the 1950s, was controversial from the
start, with environmentalists contending it was unsightly and split
the waterfront from San Francisco's downtown.
   In opposing demolition, Supervisor Richard Hongisto said
neighborhood businesses would suffer during the time it will take
to build a new roadway.
   ``Instead of our favorite Italian or Chinese restaurant, when
the freeway finally gets built, you'll find a McDonald's,''
Hongisto said.
   Agnos vowed to develop a system of streets to route traffic
efficiently. He said after the vote that the demolition presented
the ``opportunity of a lifetime.''
   Supervisor Jim Gonzalez said the city had a chance to ``build
one of the most beautiful waterfronts in the history of the United
States.''
   The Board of Supervisors' vote to ``endorse the concept of a
subsurface or surface freeway'' will make a final review of the
issue by Aug. 1.

<HEAD>Vargas Llosa Decides Against Quitting Presidential Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa has decided not to
withdraw from the presidential runoff against Alfredo Fujimori, the
upstart independent who is suddenly favored to win.
   Saying he is constitutionally required to take part in the
second round, Vargas Llosa declared Monday that he will campaign
``fighting for the reforms that our country needs.'' The runoff
will probably take place in early June.
   The celebrated writer, who advocates harsh austerity measures to
revive the country's crippled economy, won the most votes in the
first round of voting April 8 but was far from the majority needed
for election.
   After his disappointing first-round showing, Vargas Llosa
considered pulling out of the race. But he was reported to have
been urged to stay in the race by Roman Catholic officials and
senior figures in the military.
   The government is battling a bloody 10-year-old insurgency by
Maoist-inspired Shining Path rebels and the military apparently
fears Fujimori would not be as forceful a leader as Vargas Llosa.
   Fujimori, an agronomist who says Vargas Llosa's economic plan
would only bring recession, is expected to pick up the votes that
had been cast for leftist candidates in the first round. It is
believed that Vargas Llosa's association with the wealthy cost him
much support.
   The writer entered the political fray two years ago after
leading rallies against President Alan Garcia's attempts to
nationalize the country's banks.
   Fujimori, the descendent of Japanese immigrants and a political
unknown when he started the race, has been criticized by Vargas
Llosa's center-right Democratic Front coalition for being vague on
his plans for Peru.
   Finally, he is detailing some concrete proposals. In an
interview published Monday, Fujimori rejected Vargas Llosa's call
to privatize most of Peru's huge companies, which many Peruvians
fear would lead to massive layoffs.
   The candidate also sharply criticized U.S. drug policy in Peru,
saying Washington-backed attempts have failed to eradicate coca
plants _ the raw material of cocaine.
   The 51-year-old former rector of Peru's respected National
University of Agriculture recommended building railroads and
highways into Peru's main coca-producing region so local farmers
can more easily get legal produce to markets along the coast.
   Coca growers ``must be oriented towards other types of cash
crops _ rice for example. But for this, highways must be built,''
Fujimori said in the interview in the Lima daily newspaper Pagina
Libre.
   Fujimori was set to announce his official platform at a Monday
night press conference, but he canceled at the last minute due to
what his wife described as food poisoning.
   Vargas Llosa's announcement he would stay in the race came an
hour later, in a short communique released after meetings with
campaign strategists and leaders of his party.
   In the first round, Vargas Llosa won just 32 percent of the vote
after topping 50 percent in February opinion polls. Fujimori won 30
percent.
   The novelist's coalition also fell well short of capturing a
majority in Congress.
   Vargas Llosa went into seclusion with his family last week to
mull over the decision on whether to continue the race. Aides said
he was discouraged by the likelihood he would lose the runoff.
Equally discouraging, if he won, was the prospect of trying to
govern without a congressional majority.
   Without legislative support, Vargas Llosa would face great
problems imposing the harsh austerity measures he advocates.
   In the Pagina Libre interview, Fujimori said, ``We are not in
agreement with the `shock' (program proposed by Vargas Llosa) which
would bring a deeper recession, and we are against a recession.''
   Fujimori was also quoted as saying he would welcome ``foreign
funds and advice'' in the fight against the Shining Path.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index lost morning
gains to inch lower today, while the dollar strengthened against
the Japanese yen on expectations of a decline in the U.S. trade
deficit.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 1.58 points, or 0.006
percent, ending the day at 28,461.60. The index, which on Monday
fell 750.74 points, started lower, regained 349.65 points, and fell
back in the afternoon session.
   Some of the buying in the morning was carried out to prevent the
index from falling below 28,000 points, which is seen as a
psychological barrier, said a dealer with Nomura Securities Co.,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The stock market is still very sensitive and nervous, although
we believe it has bottomed out,'' the dealer said.
   Traders attributed the afternoon losses to intermittent
index-linked selling, including arbitrage, by securities firms.
   ``Both Japanese and foreign securities firms conducted arbitrage
selling from time to time in small amounts throughout the afternoon
session,'' said Masayoshi Shimoyama, a senior trader with Nikko
Securities Co.
   Stock traders and analysts have blamed arbitrage sellings for
the continuing plunge of the Tokyo stock market since the beginning
of this year. Large-scale arbitrage sales in thin trading have a
strong impact on the market.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange has asked member firms to make a weekly
report on the number of shares and the amount of money traded in
arbitrage dealings to eliminate uncertainties among investors,
stock market officials said Tuesday.
   Shimoyama said participants gradually withdrew to the sidelines
toward the end of the day ahead of the announcement of U.S. trade
figures for February slated for Wednesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 159.83 yen, up 0.41
yen from Monday's close of 159.42 yen. The currency opened at
159.71 yen and traded between 159.60 yen and 159.95 yen.
   The dollar was pushed up during the afternoon session by
investors expecting improvements in the U.S. trade balance, dealers
said.
   ``The U.S. trade deficit is expected to be around $8.1 billion
from $9.3 billion in January. Some even predict the deficit will be
$4-5 billion,'' said Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with New
Japan Securities Co.
   However, dollar selling for profit-taking prevented the U.S.
currency from climbing over the 160-yen level, Kanai said.
   Uncertainties over developments in Lithuania also prompted
dollar buying, because the dollar is believed to be the safest
investment in times of emergency, said Masato Hayashi, a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Friday threatened to
impose economic sanctions on Lithuania if the rebel Baltic republic
refuses to rescind legislation passed since its declaration of
independence last month.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds was changing hands at 85.90 points at 4 p.m., up
from Monday's close at 85.74. The 119's yield fell to 7.385 percent
from 7.415 percent on Monday.

   Mayor Raymond Flynn says he's decided against
running for governor out of loyalty to the city of Boston.
   ``The foremost challenge before us today is the task of building
a better future for the children of all our neighborhoods and
turning the tide against violence, the illegal drug trade and the
despair that affects too many of our citizens,'' the Democrat said
in a letter to 1,500 community leaders and advocates Monday.
   ``To complete this unfinished work, I feel an obligation to
continue as mayor of this city.''
   Flynn had kept analysts and the public speculating on whether he
would seek the state's top office ever since Gov. Michael Dukakis,
whose fortunes plummeted after the 1988 presidential campaign,
decided against a fourth term 15 months ago.
   ``I have an obligation to the people of the city of Boston,''
the mayor told the Boston Herald on Monday as he drank beer at a
bar after running the Boston Marathon. ``It's an L-word. It's
loyalty. I have to stay with them.''
   Already seeking the Democratic nomination are John Silber, on
leave from his post as president of Boston University; former state
Attorney General Francis Bellotti, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy and state
Rep. John Flood.
   Running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination are former
U.S. Attorney William Weld and state House Minority Leader Stephen
Pierce.
   In a general election poll by the Becker Institute last month,
Flynn led GOP frontrunner Pierce by 20 points.

<HEAD>French Newspaper: Libya, Not Palestinians, Seized Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper says three hostages released in
Lebanon last week were seized in 1986 by Libya's navy, not the
following year by Abu-Nidal's Palestinian terrorist group as had
been claimed.
   Monday's front-page article in Le Monde and other similar
reports could increase pressure on France to reveal more details
about the case.
   French officials effusively thanked Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi after the release of Jacqueline Valente of France, her
Belgian companion Fernand Houtekins and the child born to them in
captivity.
   Critics accused France of cutting a deal for their freedom.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, Abu Nidal's Libyan-backed
group, claimed in November 1987 that it had seized a yacht carrying
suspected pro-Israeli spies in the eastern Mediterranean.
   Aboard were Ms. Valente; two of her daughters, who were freed in
1988; Houtekins and four members of his family. The four members of
Houtekins family are still being held while Abu Nidal demands the
release of a Palestinian sentenced to life in prison in Belgium for
a terrorist attack.
   Le Monde said in Monday's article that it appeared the boat
actually was captured by the Libyan navy in 1986 in waters between
Malta and Libya's Gulf of Sidra. It said Gadhafi later asked Abu
Nidal's group to claim responsibility.
   Le Monde gave no specific sources for its report.
   A 1986 abduction date would explain the mystery surrounding
Sophie-Liberte, the daughter of Houtekins and Valente. Reporters
who saw the girl after her release generally agreed she looked and
acted like a 4-year-old.
   Le Monde said its version of the capture would also explain a
few comments by the freed hostages, who have declined to answer
questions about their abduction and captivity.
   An aide to Abu Nidal claimed the hostages were held in Lebanon
throughout their captivity, and they were released April 10 in
Lebanon. But Le Monde noted that Houtekins _ walking to freedom at
the French Embassy in Beirut _ said he was ``tired by the voyage,''
suggesting he had made a long journey.
   Also, Houtekins said they had been kept for a long period in a
``large villa'' _ which Le Monde said was ``unthinkable in the hell
of Lebanon.''
   The week before the hostages were released, Gadhafi publicly
appealed for them to be set free. Immediately after their release,
Gadhafi was thanked by President Francois Mitterrand and praised as
a ``humanitarian'' by Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   Le Monde said there were no firm rules for governments in
dealing with hostage cases but asked: ``At what point does a state
have the right to enter into this hellish game if it must support
the most shameful of lies for the enormous benefit of criminals.''
   The newspaper Le Figaro reported last week the possibility that
the freed hostages were seized by Libya, earlier than previously
reported.
   The hostages held by Abu Nidal's group are considered separate
from the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon. Most of them are believed
to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   As enigmatic in death as she was in life, Greta
Garbo will be buried privately, the question of who will inherit
her fortune unclear.
   The New York Post reported today that the actress died a rich
woman but left no will.
   Officials at New York Hospital _ where the husky-voiced actress
died Sunday at age 84 _ said Monday that funeral services would be
private.
   ``Private means private and everyone should respect her
wishes,'' said longtime friend and neighbor Ben Buttenweiser. ``It
makes sense that she would have wanted it that way, otherwise you'd
need the whole, entire United States Army on hand to keep everybody
out.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Myrna Manners said Garbo had been a kidney
dialysis patient, but at the family's request she released no other
information. The medical examiner's office told the Post that
Garbo's body would be cremated.
   Garbo starred in 26 films in 17 years. In 1941, at age 36, she
quit Hollywood, spending the rest of her life in shuttered and
fenced residences in France, Switzerland and Manhattan, where she
lived in an East Side high-rise.
   Her frugal ways and good financial advice built the star's
holdings into a fortune, according to the Post, which reported she
owned several buildings in Beverly Hills, an extensive art
collection and her East Side co-op.
   Her only relative is her niece, Grae Reisfeld of Passaic, N.J.,
who also fiercely guards her privacy, the Post said.
   The Swedish beauty's sculpted face and husky voice made her an
international star and one of the world's most famous recluses,
living by her most famous line, ``I vant to be alone.''
   However, she was not a shut-in but took long, solitary walks
around town in a slouch hat and dark glasses.
   ``She'd get up in the morning and go out walking. She loved to
window shop. ... The surprising thing is that she wasn't recognized
more frequently,'' playwright Garson Kanin told the Daily News.
   He remembers her telling him, ``People in New York really don't
bother you at all. When I go home to Sweden, everybody stares and
asks for autographs. In New York, it's easy to be anonymous.''
   Born Lovisa Gustafsson in Stockholm, Garbo made her screen debut
in 1923. She made 12 silent films before uttering her first words
in the 1930 movie ``Anna Christie'': ``Gimme a visky, ginger ale on
the side. And don't be stingy, baby.''
   ``She was always a living, unreachable myth ... the founder of a
religious order called cinema,'' said Italian film director
Federico Fellini. ``She gave cinema the sacredness of Mass.''

<HEAD>At Least 33 Killed In Easter Black Factional Fighting</HEAD>
<HEAD>By BARRY RENFREW</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 33 people were killed
and dozens hurt in vicious black factional fighting over the Easter
holiday despite stepped up efforts by security forces to end
unrest, authorities said today.
   The latest unrest came as President F.W. de Klerk was expected
to make a major speech in Parliament today on further steps to
dismantle apartheid. Conservative opposition groups said they would
resist any attempt by the government to repeal apartheid
legislation.
   Police said most of the fighting was in Natal province, where
rival Zulu factions battled with guns and knives and set fire to
homes and cars in clashes over the four-day holiday weekend.
   Among violent incidents police reported, a man and two women
were taken from their home Monday near Port Shepstone in Natal and
hacked to death by a mob that then burned the bodies.
   A soldier and a police officer were killed in separate incidents
during the weekend when security forces attempted to intervene in
clashes in Natal, police said. Three police officers were hurt
Monday when they were stoned by a mob.
   The government moved military reinforcements into Natal in an
attempt to stem the factional fighting, which has claimed hundreds
of lives in the region in recent weeks. Military patrols blocked
roads and guarded black townships.
   Govermment officials, who declined to be named, said de Klerk
would today outline plans to dismantle major apartheid laws,
including legislation restricting use of public facilities along
racial lines.
   The government wanted to present steps on ending apartheid
before the start of talks next month with the African National
Congress. The two sides are to try to clear the way for full-scale
negotiations on ending white-minority rule.
   South African newspapers reported today that the government
hopes steps on reducing apartheid will boost international support
for South Africa and lead to the end or reduction of economic
sanctions.
   De Klerk, who has promised to end white-minority rule and share
political power with blacks, legalized the ANC and other black
opposition groups in February. The president also released Nelson
Mandela, who will head the ANC delegation to the May 2 talks in
Cape Town.
   The independent South African Press Association reported today
that political prisoners held on Robben Island off Cape Town hope
to be freed following the May talks. The ANC is demanding the
release of all political prisoners and ending of a state of
emergency.
   The fighting in Natal pits the ANC-allied United Democratic
Front against the conservative Inkatha movement. Both groups are
anti-apartheid, but differ over plans for a future South Africa.

   Julie Rivers has a home where the buffalo
roam. That's the problem.
   Her two 900-pound pet buffaloes wandered away Sunday and eluded
capture Monday.
   ``I'm just worried they won't find water,'' Ms. Rivers said.
``They probably will, but I guess I'm worried anyway.''
   The male's name is Tatanka and the female is Sheena. Both are 14
months old and stand about 4 feet high. Ms. Rivers got the pair in
August.
   They are affectionate pets, but Ms. Rivers warns: ``I don't want
people to get the idea they could play with them. They could charge
somebody if they got scared. You need to respect them is all.''
   Ms. Rivers had been keeping the beasts behind a 4-foot fence
while she looked for a home where the buffalo couldn't roam.
``They're jumpers and they jumped right over it,'' she said. ``Now
we know we waited too late.''
   Ms. Rivers, her boyfriend and her son tracked the buffalo from
the house to a restaurant about five miles away before losing the
trail.
   ``We love them,'' Ms. Rivers said. ``They each have their own
personality. It's been very interesting to watch them grow. They're
very playful. They run and kick. They've really been a joy.''

<HEAD>Animal-Rights Activist Pleads No Contest to Attempted Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal-rights activist pleaded no
contest to charges she attempted to kill the head of a surgical
supply company with a bomb. Under the plea bargain, she will
receive one year in prison.
   Fran Trutt, 33, pleaded no contest Monday to attempted murder,
possession of explosives and bomb manufacturing.
   Trutt, who earlier turned down a plea agreement that did not
permit her visits with her four dogs, could have received 20 years
in prison on the attempted murder charge alone.
   She was arrested in 1988 after a remote-controlled pipe bomb was
found near the parking space of U.S. Surgical Corp. chairman Leon
Hirsch in Norwalk.
   Defense attorney John Williams said she opted for the plea
bargain because the prosecution planned to present tape recorded
conversations in which Trutt discussed her sex life and the murder
attempt.
   ``The sex tapes _ I think that's what did it. It was just
disgusting,'' he said. The tapes were of telephone conversations
between Trutt and a woman hired by U.S. Surgical to befriend Trutt
and spy on her, the lawyer said.
   U.S. Surgical has been criticized by animal-rights activists for
its use of anesthetized dogs to train physicians in the use of
surgical staples instead of stitches. The dogs are then destroyed.
   In entering her plea, Trutt maintained her innocence. Instead,
she accused Hirsch of murdering dogs. As Superior Court Judge
Joette Katz reviewed the charges, Trutt said, ``The one who was
guilty of that is Hirsch.''
   Animal-rights activists and Trutt claimed she was set up by the
company to discredit their movement, which had long criticized U.S.
Surgical.
   In a statement, U.S. Surgical said the case vindicated the
company.
   Activists ``can protest, that they can disagree and they can
picket peacefully, but the American system of justice will pursue
vigorously those who attempt to force their views on others through
violence,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Nine prisoners convicted of murder
were hanged in Korea today as part of an official campaign to stem
rising crime, the Justice Ministry announced.
   Seven of the prisoners were executed in a Seoul prison, and two
in Taegu and Pusan, both south of the capital, officials said. Some
had also been convicted of rape.
   They said the action was intended to show the public that the
government is determined to maintain law and order at a time of
rising crime. Many South Koreans are fearful about crime,
especially murder, rape, and mob activity.
   The Justice Ministry listed the number of felonies as 7,590 in
1989, up 13.4 percent from 1988. The number in the first quarter of
this year rose 8.1 percent from a year ago to 2,198.
   The last execution was in August 1989, when seven criminals were
hanged.
   With today's executions, 17 criminals remain on death row,
officials said.

   The dollar strengthened in early European trading
today as traders returned from the four-day Easter holiday weekend.
Gold prices fell.
   Currency dealers in Frankfurt said early trading was quiet as
the market attempted to establish a new trend. A speech later today
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady may help set the tone for
this week, said traders in Milan.
   The dollar was buoyed by the continued weakness of the Japanese
yen, and by expectations the U.S. trade deficit for February will
have narrowed, they said. The trade figures are to be released
Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.41 yen to a closing 159.83 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 159.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6816 West German marks, up from 1.6730
   _1.4925 Swiss francs, up from 1.4835
   _5.6475 French francs, up from 5.6213

   _1,235.50 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50
   _1.1700 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633
   In London, the dollar firmed against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6285, compared with $1.6425 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $373.75 a troy ounce,
down from $375.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $373.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $374.00, down from $375.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at a bid
$375.39.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.07 a troy ounce, from

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Appeals by Louisiana Death Row Inmate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANGOLA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way
for the execution of a nearly retarded man for the 1977 murder of a
state trooper.
   Lifting a stay of execution it granted four months ago, the high
court on Monday voted 7-2 to deny the appeals by Dalton Prejean,
30, who has been on death row since 1978, longer than any other
inmate in Louisiana.
   Death penalty opponents have made Prejean's case a cause
celebre, saying he should be spared because he was just 17 when he
shot Trooper Donald Cleveland and because he has an IQ of 76 and
the mental capability of a 13-year-old.
   No new execution date was set for Prejean, who is at the
Louisiana State Penitentiary and was less than eight hours away
from the electric chair in November when the high court granted the
stay and agreed to consider the case.
   The Pardon Board voted 3-2 that month to recommend Gov. Buddy
Roemer reduce Prejean's sentence to life in prison based on
testimony that he had been abused as a child and may have brain
damage. Roemer rejected the recommendation.
   Prejean shot Cleveland twice in the face with a .38-caliber
pistol after a routine traffic stop. Six months earlier, Prejean
had been released from a reform school, where had served time for
killing a cab driver at age 14.
   Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution
does not forbit executing murderers who are retarded or were
teen-agers at the time of the crime.
   Prejean's appeal focused largely on whether the judge's
instructions to the jury had prevented full consideration of
Prejean's mental deficiencies.
   In refusing to grant clemency last year, Roemer cited the brutal
nature of Cleveland's death, noted that Cleveland was a uniformed
trooper on duty at the time and said the sentence met all judicial
standards for the death penalty.
   Voting in Prejean's favor Monday were Justices William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose capital punishment under
all circumstances.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said in the event
of an Israeli nuclear attack, he has instructed his commanders to
hit Israel with chemical weapons without waiting for orders,
government media reported today.
   Several newspapers and the Iraqi News Agency said Saddam made
the disclosure last week during talks with a group of six visiting
U.S. senators led by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.
   ``I ordered the commanders of air and rocket bases, if they ever
hear that Israel hits any base or place in Iraq with an atomic
bomb, you have to hit Israel because Israel could hit us while we
(the leadership) are holding a meeting in Baghdad,'' Saddam was
quoted as saying.
   ``So you have an advance order to hit back, even in the event
that you do not have an order from a top commander, if Israel bombs
any base or any Iraqi city,'' the Iraqi media quoted him as saying.
   Israeli jets using conventional bombs destroyed an unfinished
Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad in 1981. Israel claimed the
facility was being used to develop atomic weapons, but Iraq denied
it.
   Saddam had earlier announced that in the event of an Israeli
attack on Iraqi installations, his nation would retaliate with
advanced binary chemical weapons.
   That announcement came after the arrests in London of several
people accused of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to Iraq.
Later, British customs agents impounded Iraq-bound steel tubing in
northern England, saying it could be part of a huge gun.
   After meeting with Saddam, Dole did not give many details of
their talks but did say Saddam was seriously worried Israel would
launch a pre-emptive strike similar to the one in 1981.

<TEXT>
   An American scientist cited as the ``father of
artificial intelligence'' and three earthquake researchers,
including a U.S. professor, today received the two 1990 Japan
Prizes, each worth $315,000.
   Professor Marvin Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, who has been working on how to make computers learn
more by themselves, received his prize in the field of ``technology
of integration.''
   The other prize, for earth science, was shared by American
professor William Jason Morgan of Princeton University, professor
Dan Peter McKenzie of Britain's Cambridge University and Xavier Le
Pichon, director of the Ecole Normale Superieure in France.
   The three were cited for their work on the theory that the
Earth's crust is made up of rigid tectonic plates that grind
against each other, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and the
formation of ridges and mountains.
   The prizes were awarded at ceremonies attended by Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   The non-profit Science and Technology Foundation of Japan, under
the direction of the Prime Minister's Office, began awarding the
prizes in 1985 to promote applied scientific research of direct
benefit to mankind.
   It has expressed hope that the Japan Prize will become as widely
recognized as the Nobel Prize.
   The foundation said it received 662 recommendations for this
year's prizes.
   The 1991 prizes will be awarded for applied mathematics and
imaging techniques in medicine, it added.
   On Monday, Morgan told a news conference that despite progress
in forecasting the location and size of earthquakes, predicting the
exact time ``is still pretty much in the future.''
   Minsky told reporters that in the next few years a computer
``will be able to watch your eyes and your face and will be able to
tell what interests you.''
   It might, for example, enlarge whatever the operator is studying
on the screen, he said.
   Minsky said some computers now can recognize spoken words
without understanding their meaning.
   ``In another generation, maybe 10 years, maybe 50, the computer
will have more understanding, like a child, and know what words
really mean, and then it will be more like talking to another
person,'' he said.
   ``Once that happens, it's impossible to make predictions,'' he
added.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Communist authorities said
they are clamping down on dissent and warned that the army stands
ready to defend socialism.
   The warnings indicate that Vietnam is entrenching as movements
for democratic reform sweep the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Hanoi Radio said a mass movement had been broadened in all areas
to safeguard national security, according to a transcript of the
broadcast seen in Bangkok today.
   This included a ``crackdown on those who seek to undermine
political security,'' the radio said.
   The radio broadcast on Sunday quoted from an editorial published
the same day in the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.
   It said the crackdown was also directed at ``corrupt elements,
bribe takers, smugglers, illegal traders and swindlers ...
distributors of decadent and reactionary reading materials ...
those who instigate and rally forces to oppose the ... policies of
our party and state.''
   The report gave no specific details of the crackdown.
   The official Vietnam News Agency on Sunday quoted Vo Chi Cong,
the president of the state council and second-ranking member of the
Communist Party politburo, as saying ``imperialist and reactionary
forces'' were attempting to destabilize Southeast Asia and weaken
Vietnam.
   In a speech to infantry cadets, he said the army and the people
would ``protect the purity of Marxism-Leninism (and) defend the
party administration and socialism in our country.''
   Soviet-backed Vietnam has strongly criticized the political
changes in Eastern Europe that it says are the result of a plot by
the West to destroy socialism.
   While emphasizing the leading role of the Communist Party, Hanoi
also has stressed the need for reform and has purged what it said
were corrupt party members.
   Earlier this month it announced a major cabinet reshuffle,
streamlining a dozen government ministries into three new ones and
dissolving other offices.
   In March the party purged Tran Xuan Bach, a politburo member who
had advocated more democratic reforms, saying he had seriously
violated party discipline.

   The death toll in a food poisoning
outbreak from a marriage engagement party rose to 150 people today
and an official said more fatalities were expected, news reports
said.
   Hundreds of people were hospitalized after the feast Sunday in
the northern village of Raipura Jungla near Lucknow, capital of the
Uttar Pradesh state.
   At least 80 people were pronounced dead on Monday and 70 more
died today, Press Trust of India reported.
   Hospital spokesmen said the number of deaths could not be
estimated because the sick were brought to several hospitals. One
government health official said he expected that more people would
die.
   According to a preliminary investigation, a poisonous
phosphorous compound apparently contaminated flour used for making
puri, a puffy fried bread, and caused the deaths.
   No reports from Lucknow have suggested foul play.
   United News of India said the outbreak happened after a
``tilak'' ceremony to celebrate a marriage engagement. A tilak is a
decorative dot many Hindus wear on their foreheads on auspicious
occasions. During the ceremony, couples exchange rings and feast
with their families.
   There was no indication whether the engaged couple was among the
victims. In rural areas, such ceremonies are attended by entire
villages, drawing hundreds of people.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Death Penalty for Murderer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by a
40-year-old man convicted of killing four people and upheld a High
Court death sentence against him.
   Norio Nagayama was first convicted and sentenced to death by the
Tokyo District Court in 1979 for slaying four people during four
1968 robberies. He used a handgun stolen from a U.S. military base
in Tokyo.
   The case has been highly publicized because Nagayama, who was 19
at the time of the crimes, has written at least four award-winning
autobiographical novels since his imprisonment in 1969.
   In 1981, the Tokyo High Court commuted his death sentence to
life imprisonment.
   But after an appeal by prosecutors, the Supreme Court in 1983
ordered a retrial of the case, and four years later the High Court
reaffirmed his death sentence.
   In their appeal to the Supreme Court, defense lawyers argued the
death penalty was unconstitutional because it violated Article 36
of the Japanese constitution, which forbids cruel punishment. They
also argued Nagayama was young and mentally unstable when he
committed the crimes.
   Four judges, however, unanimously supported the High Court's
decision in favor of the death penalty.
   In two 1968 robbery attempts, Nagayama tried to break into
hotels and in both cases killed security guards before fleeing. In
two further cases, he killed taxi drivers after robbing them.
   Japanese authorities are extremely secretive about executions,
which occur by hanging, and do not disclose the time of death.
Neither the number of people on death row, nor the date of the
latest execution are available.
   By law, an execution must be carried out within six months after
a death sentence is finalized. But legal experts say executions are
frequently delayed.
   The death sentence was handed down most recently early last year
by the Nagoya District Court in the conviction of a 20-year-old man
for killing a young couple in 1988. The case has been appealed to
the High Court.

<HEAD>Mayor Sending Signals He May Seek A Fourth Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry again is accepting
donations to the re-election campaign he had put on hold while
receiving treatment for substance abuse, his top political aide
says.
   The aide, Anita Bonds, described Barry as a ``potential
candidate'' for re-election. But a WJLA-TV television reporter who
met with him Monday said, ``The mayor told me he now feels good
enough about his recovery from alcohol and chemical addictions to
seek a fourth term.''
   The station quoted unidentified sources as saying Barry ``is
convinced the city and its voters will give him a second chance.''
   Ms. Bonds told The Washington Post a formal decision on whether
Barry will launch a re-election campaign before his trial could
come late this week or next week.
   She said Barry planned to attend a forum being hosted next week
by the American Federation of Government Employees, a powerful
labor union in the District whose endorsement is coveted by city
candidates.
   Barry returned to the district a month ago after several weeks
of treatment for alcohol and chemical dependencies. He entered
treatment after being arrested in a sting operation in which
federal authorities allegedly videotaped the mayor smoking crack
cocaine in a hotel.
   Barry was indicted on felony charges of lying to a grand jury
about alleged past drug use and on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine
possession. His trial is scheduled for June 4.
   Barry has been acting like a candidate since his return, meeting
with neighborhood and civic groups in campaign-style events.
   But until now he has shied away from formal mayoral campaign
forums, at which most of the candidates have criticized the Barry
administration.
   ``Until the mayor were to say he was not going to run, he is not
going to lose touch with his constituencies,'' Ms. Bonds told the
Post. She said the mayor resumed accepting political donations
shortly after his return and has garnered only a few ``small''
donations. Some longtime Barry financial supporters have defected
to other candidates or shied away from the race to date.
   Barry acknowledged in a Post interview over the weekend that he
has skipped some of the counseling sessions he promised to attend
after returning from treatment. He said he mistakenly believed he
could attend church services as an alternative.
   There already was a crowded Democratic mayoral field before
Barry's arrest. While the mayor was in treatment, Walter Fauntroy,
the district's delegate to Congress, announced he would seek the
Democratic nomination.

   Florida's three Democratic
gubernatorial candidates plan to release their medical records
following the disclosure that one of them, former Sen. Lawton
Chiles, is undergoing treatment for depression.
   Chiles will be opposed in the Sept. 4 primary by Rep. Bill
Nelson and state Sen. George Stuart.
   ``Every intimate detail is open and is fair game,'' Nelson said
Monday. ``Every candidate's mental and physical health is a
legitimate issue, especially with regard to a race that is for the
governor of Florida, since that is so important to the future of
Florida.''
   Chiles, 60, said last week he is nearing successful completion
of prescribed drug therapy for depression. The former senator, who
retired in 1988, said he began taking a 25-milligram tablet of
Prozac daily late last year.
   ``I think full disclosure of the medical history and the medical
records, as well as Chiles' performance in the next few months,
will shed some light on this issue,'' added Nelson, who has
requested his medical chart.
   Chiles planned to get his medical records today from his
Tallahassee doctor, according to his son, Lawton M. ``Bud'' Chiles
III.
   Scott Sokol, a spokesman for Stuart, said the state senator's
medical records would also be available by the end of the week.
   Bob Martinez, Florida's second Republican governor since
Reconstruction, is seeking a second four-year term.

<HEAD>Japan Should Protect Farmers But Not Crops, U.S. Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan need not abandon its farmers for the sake of
opening up world trade, but it should end protection of specific
crops, a U.S. official said today.
   Proposals made by Washington at trade talks on agricultural
products would permit nations to help their farmers, said U.S.
Undersecretary of Agriculture Richard T. Crowder.
   ``We're not asking countries to give up agricultural support
programs. What we're asking is the support of agriculture in ways
that do not distort, or minimally distort, trade patterns,''
Crowder told reporters.
   ``What should be done is to support the income of farmers ...
but not support production of a specific crop,'' he said.
   Crowder said Japan was not alone in its fears of what would
happen to farmers in the event of trade liberalization. Nordic
nations and Switzerland had voiced similar concerns, he said.
   But, he said: ``Food security depends not on artificial
self-sufficiency but on an open, market-oriented trading
environment. ... Food security cannot legitimately be used as a
shield against true trade liberalization.''
   Japan is seeking exemptions to maintain its virtual ban on
imported rice, arguing the stiff barriers guarantee Japan's food
supply. Last week, Japan reiterated its opposition to rice imports
in an annual paper on agriculture endorsed by the Cabinet.
   The United States has proposed a phase-out of agricultural trade
subsidies and barriers at the Uruguay Round of talks, sponsored by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks run through
December.
   Crowder, in Tokyo for consultations with Japanese officials,
said the United States was prepared to address Japan's concerns.
American proposals do not call for quick approach to
liberalization, but rather a 10-year transition period to ease the
shock of imports, he said.
   But for liberalization to succeed, all forms of agricultural
supports _ export subsidies, import access, internal controls and
health regulations _ must be put on the table at once for
negotiation, he said.
   ``None of us are without sin,'' he said, acknowledging U.S. farm
supports would also have to be eliminated.
   Crowder said the U.S. proposal was met with a cold reception,
especially from European Community nations.
   But he said Japan should support trade liberalization across the
board.
   ``Given Japan's prominent place in international trade, we think
Japan needs to take a strong leadership role in the GATT
negotiations. Japan will benefit significantly from supporting
major trade reform,'' Crowder said.
   The Geneva-based GATT sets rules for international trade.

   An envelope addressed to ``tax thieves'' exploded
outside a suburban post office, injuring a postal worker and
shutting the office for several hours before the tax deadline.
   The blast occurred at 8:30 p.m. Monday in a mail hamper placed
outside the Royal Oak Post Office to collect tax returns from
filers rushing to meet the midnight deadline.
   ``From the writing on the envelope, there was an indication it
was some kind of tax protest,'' U.S. Postal Inspector Fred Van de
Putte said.
   There were no arrests, postal officials said this morning.
   The envelope, addressed ``To The Tax Thieves,'' contained a
Roman candle and a tea bag, Van de Putte said.
   The tea bag apparently referred to the Boston Tea Party of 1773,
the tax protest that helped spark the American Revolution. The
envelope also contained an unidentified red fluid and a fuse, fire
Capt. Ron Gammon said.
   Tom Berlucchi, 29, a maintenance employee for 10 years, spotted
the envelope smoking in a bin of last-minute tax returns.
   ``Berlucchi smelled something burning,'' Van de Putte said. ``He
pushed aside the other mail and saw a brown, padded envelope.''
   Berlucchi was trying to toss the parcel into a nearby puddle
when it exploded.
   Berlucchi was treated for burns on his hands and face and
released, William Beaumont Hospital spokeswoman Valerie Mahaczek
said.
   ``We don't know exactly what the explosive device was,'' Gammon
said. ``I guess the fluid was supposed to be blood. It flew all
over the place.''
   Gammon said the department initially was told the explosion was
inside the post office, the distribution center for Oakland County.
   ``When we got there, there were about 20 or 30 tax protesters,
but they disappeared fast,'' he said. There was no information
linking the protesters to the blast.
   Patti Hornick, who was dropping off her tax return, said: ``I
thought it was a fireworks display or something, it looked like a
huge fireworks explosion. We just dropped our taxes in the bin and
we saw them working on the injured man.''
   The blast did little or no structural damage to the post office,
Royal Oak police Lt. Ray Taylor said.
   Agents of the FBI, federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and state police bomb squad also responded to the
explosion, but the investigation was turned over to the Postal
Service because it involved mail.

<HEAD>French Judge Orders Ad Company To Display Controversial Posters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ruled that a movie poster showing a
sexually aroused young angel should be allowed in subway stations
despite objections by the advertising company that sells the ad
space.
   Judge Marie-Claude Domb said the poster, denounced by some
religious groups as obscene, might shock some subway riders.
   ``But it could just as easily raise a smile,'' she said.
   Metrobus, which has a monopoly over advertising in the Paris
Metro, had argued that it was entitled to reject the poster,
advertising a new movie called ``It's Freezing In Hell'' by
director Jean-Pierre Mocky.
   The poster shows a painting of two chubby, smiling young angels
with black wings, the female wearing black silk stockings and the
male in a state of sexual arousal.
   In the context of contemporary morality, the judge said, it was
unlikely the poster would ``seriously offend the modesty of many
people.''
   Mocky initiated the court action to force Metrobus to display
about 260 copies of the posters from Wednesday through May 2, for a
payment of $75,000.

   The Daily News has stopped deducting union dues
from paychecks of members of 10 unions embroiled in contract talks
with the newspaper.
   The dues deduction, a convenience to the unions, was eliminated
Monday by the News, as the unions had expected.
   The 10 unions, under the umbrella of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, are locked in contract talks that are considered decisive
for the tabloid's future. Contracts expired March 30.
   ``We will not be provoked and we will collect our own dues with
no problem without the assistance of the Daily News,'' said Deborah
Friedman, a spokeswoman for the unions.
   The News says it must eliminate overstaffing and invest $500
million in new printing plants to become profitable.

<HEAD>Students Clash With Riot Police in Anti-government Protests</HEAD>

   Radical students shouting
anti-government slogans clashed with riot police in two provincial
cities today while in Seoul others rallied to mark a 1960 student
uprising, news reports said.
   About 1,200 students hurled rocks and firebombs in battles with
police at two universities in southern Kwangju, an opposition
stronghold, the Yonhap News Agency said. Police used tear gas to
stop protesters from marching off campus.
   Similar clashes broke out at another southern city, Sunchun,
where 300 students, shouting ``Down with Roh!'' tried to march from
their school after a campus rally, it said.
   Yonhap did not say whether there were any injuries or arrests in
the two cities.
   In Seoul, about 7,000 students rallied at Korea University and
proclaimed ``a week of protests'' marking the April 19, 1960,
student uprising that toppled South Korea's first government, led
by the late President Syngman Rhee.
   Radical students in all three cities also protested a political
merger in January, when President Roh Tae-woo's conservative party
joined with two moderate opposition groups, giving Roh's ruling
group an overwhelming parliamentary majority.
   ``Let's crush the three-party merger,'' a student leader in
Seoul shouted from beneath a two-story-high banner showing a
student walking away from a U.S. flag. The crowd took up the chant.
   After the rally, the students marched through the campus singing
anti-government songs. They did not clash with riot police, who
stood by outside the school gate.
   Fierce fighting lasted for almost two hours at Chonnam
University in Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, where 700 students
tried to march from the school after a two-hour campus rally.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Drive out Yankees!'' Yonhap quoted
students as shouting.
   Police, using two armored vehicles equipped with tear gas
launchers, sealed off the school's main gate and washed away
anti-government slogans painted by students on the pavement, the
agency said.
   At Chosun University, in a different section of the city, about
500 students threw rocks and firebombs, fighting police for more
than an hour, Yonhap said. Police responded with tear gas, it said.
   Also Tuesday, President Roh met with leaders of his ruling party
to end a factional feud.
   Government officials said after the six-hour meeting that Roh
and three co-leaders of the party agreed to work toward party
unity. They also agreed to continue democratic reforms, the
officials said.

<HEAD>Soviet Trade Union Council Head Replaced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet trade union federation, which has come
under criticism for kowtowing to the government instead of
defending workers' interests, replaced its chairman today, the
official news agency Tass said.
   Stepan Shalayev, 61, who had been chairman of the All Union
Central Council of Trade Unions for eight years, asked to retire
and was replaced by Deputy Chairman Gennady Yanaev, Tass said.
   The change comes at a time when labor disputes continue to
simmer in the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands of coal miners
walked out across the country last summer, and strikes are
threatened in the oil-rich western Siberian region of Tyumen.
   The trade union council for decades acted mainly as a
distributor of vacation trips, medical care and other benefits
rather than as an advocate for better conditions for workers. It
also conveyed government and Communist Party directives to workers.
   Last year, however, criticism mounted against the labor
federation, particularly during the coal strikes, when miners
complained that if the unions had taken better care of them they
wouldn't have felt forced to strike.
   The council has since made visible efforts to improve its image.
A plenum last fall pledged to conduct ``effective social policies''
and urged a price freeze on basic commodities. It also pushed for
an end to shortages of dairy products, soap, medicine and notebooks.
   Today's plenary meeting defined the trade union's role as
working toward ``helping the population adjust to a market economy
and simultaneously helping the poorer strata'' of society.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he is planning soon to
introduce radical economic reforms that are expected to include
price increases and heighten unemployment.
   The council proposed a system that would compensate poor people,
especially those on fixed incomes, for price hikes.
   Yanaev, 52, graduated from an agricultural institute and law
school, and headed the Soviet Committee of Youth Organizations for
12 years, Tass reported.
   ``He has won domestic popularity for his parliamentary crusade
for workers' social and economic rights and interests,'' the news
agency said.

<HEAD>Search Continues for Three Missing Fishermen After One Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard searched by air and sea
today for three fishermen missing since their boat sank in the
Atlantic Ocean last week.
   A fourth man from the 34-foot fiberglass fishing boat was found
Monday drifting in an open wood box about 20 miles east of Hilton
Head Island, S.C.
   Nathan Neesmith, 32, was rescued Monday morning by a passing
boat, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Brett Farrell.
   Neesmith was in serious condition suffering from hypothermia and
dehydration in Savannah's Memorial Medical Center, hospital
spokeswoman Ronnie Boaen said today.
   Farrell said Neesmith told his rescuers he was one of four crew
members on a commercial fishing boat that sank after it left
Darien, Ga., last Wednesday en route to a fishing area off Edisto
Beach, S.C.
   Coast Guard officials do not know exactly when the boat sank or
how long the man had floated in the box, which may have been used
as an engine cover on the boat, Farrell said.
   Neesmith probably was able to survive because most of his body
was ``up and out'' of the water in the box, Farrell said. Neesmith,
who was described by a doctor as ``confused,'' had been able to
tell searchers little about what happened.
   The Coast Guard sent two boats and two helicopters to search for
the three other crew members, but no sign of them had been found by
early today, Farrell said.
   He identified the missing men as 23-year-old Billy Joe Neesmith,
brother of Nathan Neesmith 18-year-old Keith Wilkes and 23-year-old
Franklin Brantley.
   ``We're still out searching,'' he said. ``We haven't found any
significant debris or anything at this point.''
   Boaters and commercial fishermen were helping with the search,
which was centered about 30 miles east of Hilton Head, Farrell said.
   Jean Neesmith, an aunt of the Neesmith brothers who was reached
by telephone at her Darien home, said the men were commercial
fishermen who ``went fishing for snappers for a living.'' She said
Billy Joe Neesmith was the captain of the boat, which was owned by
a South Carolina man.
   She said Wilkes is a nephew of the Neesmiths and Brantley is a
childhood friend.
   ``God only knows what happened out there,'' she said. ``We're
just hoping they find them alive.''

<TEXT>
   A senior opposition politician warned
today that Pakistan faces a growing crisis because Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has encouraged an influx of thousands of Moslem
militants from Indian-held Kashmir seeking weapons and training.
   Abdul Qayyum, president of Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir, or
Free Kashmir, said Ms. Bhutto's emotional vows of solidarity with
the militants had unduly raised their hopes.
   ``The emotional outbursts of the prime minister herself, saying
`your blood is our blood ... Our blood is the same' has very
seriously backfired,'' said Qayyum, whose right-of-center All
Jammu-Kashmir Moslem Conference Party governs Pakistani-controlled
Kashmir.
   ``They are here. ... Now they are disillusioned,'' he said.
   Qayyum said fleeing militants have received only food and
lodging from Pakistan, but they want more.
   ``If this repression is not stopped by India, and Pakistan is
not able to make India do anything, there will be no third
option,'' warned Qayyum, who has been a critic of Ms. Bhutto since
she took office 16 months ago.
   ``Either they (the militants in Pakistan) will turn against
Pakistan or they will have to be trained, armed and sent back to
recapture their motherland,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Qayyum warned that Pakistan could go ``up in flames'' if the
militants turned against Pakistani authorities.
   A spokesman for Ms. Bhutto dismissed Qayyum's charges.
   ``There is a trickling in of refugees ... not because of our
statements but because of Indian repression,'' said the spokesman
who cannot be identified under briefing rules. ``Innocent people
are being killed under the guise of being militants.''
   At least 270 people have died in India's turbulent state of
Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched a crackdown
on Moslem separatists seeking an independent state.
   The violence has caused escalating tensions between India and
Pakistan. India has accused Pakistan of fomenting unrest in
Jammu-Kashmir, an accusation the Islamabad government denies.
   On Saturday, Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh accused Pakistan
of a military buildup along the border and warned that Indian would
not back down from a war with its neighbor. A Pakistani Foreign
Ministry official said Singh's remarks indicated that India was
trying to provoke a war.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over Kashmir _ in 1948
and 1965. A cease-fire line monitored by the United Nations divides
the Pakistani- and Indian-controlled portions of the disputed
valley.
   The dispute over the Kashmir territory dates back to 1947 when
India and Pakistan gained their independence from Britain. The
Hindu ruler of Moslem-dominated Kashmir opted for union with India,
although other Moslem-majority provinces joined together to form
Pakistan.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in Jammu-Kashmir are
Moslem. Nationwide, only 12 percent of India's 880 million people
are Moslem, while 82 percent are Hindu.

<TEXT>
   NASA engineers fired the Galileo
spacecraft's tiny thrusters almost 1,600 times in a successful
four-day maneuver designed to help the space probe reach Jupiter in
1995.
   The thruster pulses, completed late Thursday, slowed the
spacecraft by about 55 mph, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The next set of maneuvers on the $1.35 billion mission is
scheduled for summer, spokesman Bob MacMillin said Monday.
   The 2.8-ton Galileo was launched by the space shuttle Atlantis
on Oct. 18.
   It flew past Venus on Feb. 9, enabling the planet to act as a
``gravity slingshot'' and help propel the spacecraft on its looping
2.4-billion-mile, six-year journey to Jupiter, the solar system's
largest planet.
   The spacecraft will fly past Earth on Dec. 8 and again on Dec.
8, 1992, in two more ``gravity slingshot'' maneuvers.
   Galileo will examine Earth, the moon and one or two asteroids
before it separates into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995.
They arrive at Jupiter in December 1995.
   There, the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make
measurements until intense heat and pressure vaporize it. The
orbiter will photograph and study Jupiter and its major moons until
late 1997, circling the planet instead of flying past it like the
Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.

<HEAD>Cabinet Proposes Bills to Improve Land Use in Urban Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to make land cheaper for Japanese and
more accessible to U.S. companies, the Cabinet today proposed two
bills that would promote construction on farmland and urban sites
considered underdeveloped.
   ``This will be a first concrete step'' on land policy to be
taken by Japan following Japan-U.S. talks on changing business
practices in the two countries, said Nobuyuki Yamazaki, an official
of the Construction Ministry's City Planning Divison.
   The bills are to be submitted to Parliament for approval, he
said.
   The proposals are ``intended to improve the supply of housing
and residential land in major city areas by encouraging effective
and intensive use of idle land and farmland'' Construction Minister
Tamisuke Watanuki told the Cabinet, which approved the proposed
legislation.
   Both proposals are aimed at targeting underutilized land for
residential development and at lifting restrictions on residential
construction.
   One would require three major urban areas _ Tokyo, Osaka, in
western Japan, and Nagoya, in central Japan to designate priority
areas to be developed as residential areas.
   The other bill would authorize officials to designate idle and
underutilized plots of 53,800 square feet or more as areas to be
developed for housing. It also would double to 66 feet the maximum
height of apartment buildings constructed on land originally used
for farming.
   Yamazaki said a comprehensive national land policy would be
compiled afer committees in the government and governing Liberal
Democratic Party develop proposals for tax reforms related to land
use by this autumn.
   In an interim report on bilateral structural talks between Japan
and the United States issued earlier this month, the Japanese
government said it would take steps to increase the supply of
housing and residential land.
   Spiraling land prices and a shortage of inexpensive housing are
serious problems in Japan's major cities.
   U.S. trade negotiators have said that increasing the supply of
affordable housing could lead to greater opportunities for foreign
firms to sell products and services in Japan.
   There are now about 71,659 acres of vacant or underutilized

   If about 27,181 acres of that land, including former factory
sites, were developed for residential use, about 1.8 million new
housing units could be built, it says.

<HEAD>Court Says Anti-Bias Suits May Be Filed in State Courts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawsuits charging employers with violating a
key federal anti-bias law may be filed in state as well as federal
courts, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 9-0 ruling upheld a $27,000 award won by a Chicago Ridge,
Ill., woman against her trucking company employer, the Yellow
Freight System Co.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said, ``We
have no reason to question the presumption that state courts are
just as able as federal courts'' to decide claims governed by the
federal law.
   Lawyers for Yellow Freight urged the court to rule that Coleen
Donnelly waited too long before filing a lawsuit invoking the law,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring on-the-job
discrimination.
   Mrs. Donnelly's lawsuit invoked the federal law within a
required 90-day deadline. But the case at that time was in an
Illinois state court.
   Lawyers for Yellow Freight said that does not meet the deadline
requirement because, they said, federal courts have exclusive
authority to hear Title VII cases.
   Some federal appeals courts have ruled that such suits must be
filed in federal court. But the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Mrs. Donnelly, and its decision
was upheld today.
   Mrs. Donnelly applied to Yellow Freight for a job as a
dockworker in October 1982. She was told the company was not hiring
at the time but was advised she would be the next dockworker hired.
   When Yellow Freight began hiring dockworkers agains in February
1983, Mrs. Donnelly was told the company still was not hiring.
   She was hired 18 months later.
   Mrs. Donnelly in early 1985 filed charges with the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging sexual bias in Yellow
Freight's delay in hiring her.
   The commission issued a right-to-sue notice on March 15, 1985,
triggering a 90-day deadline for the suit to be filed.
   Mrs. Donnelly sued in state court before the deadline. But her
original lawsuit did not allege a Title VII violation, only a
violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act. The suit later was
amended to included a claim that Title VII was violated.
   After Yellow Freight had the case transferred to federal court,
Mrs. Donnelly was awarded $27,656 in back pay and interest.
   The case is Yellow Freight System vs. Donnelly, 89-431.

<TEXT>
   Poll results show a very close race between
Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp for the Democratic nomination
for governor, and both have dropped behind the likely Republic
nominee, Sen. Pete Wilson.
   Feinstein, the former San Francisco mayor, was far behind Van de
Kamp, the state attorney general, in a California Poll reading of
Democratic voters' preferences last fall. But she surged ahead in
another California Poll taken two months ago.
   In the latest poll results, released Monday, 36 percent of 718
registered Democrats interviewed supported Feinstein, 35 percent
backed Van de Kamp. The remaining voters, 29 percent, were
undecided. The primary is June 5.
   Poll taker Mervin Field said an increase in the undecided
percentage might have resulted from the candidates' recent
television advertisements.
   ``The candidates have been trying to lift voters out of their
lassitude by trying negative advertising. But when both are doing
it, the public gets injured,'' Field said.
   In a sampling of 1,495 registered voters given possible general
election matchups, Wilson led Feinstein 46 percent to 38 percent
and Van de Kamp by 43 percent to 38 percent. Two months ago, he was
about even with Van de Kamp and behind Feinstein.
   The latest poll is based on interviews conducted in late March
and early April. The Field organization says the poll has a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

   Galway was scheduled to play the lead role in a new production

   He was hospitalized for an inflammation of the intestinal tract,
said Betsy Samuels, spokeswoman for Thomas Jefferson University

   The Philadelphia production was the first to use a flute player
on stage as the magpie.

   Rebel tribesmen killed 22 people during
night raids on villages in southeastern Bangladesh, the United News
of Bangladesh reported today.
   The deaths occurred during two separate attacks on Monday in the
Chittagong Hills in the Bandarban district, 155 miles southeast of
Dhaka, the news agency said. The tribesmen are resisting government
plans to settle people from the country's plains region in the
district.
   The news agency said 19 people were shot to death in their sleep
when the tribesmen opened fire with machine gunes in the village of
Sichari.
   In the second attack, the assailants shot and killed three
people in the village of Dabtachari, the news agency said.
   The tribesmen are campaigning for autonomy for the hill region,
their traditional home. More than 4,000 people have died in the
14-year-old bush war. The conflict has forced about 38,000
tribespeople to seek shelter in neighboring India.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called for more study into the
causes of climate changes today and was immediately criticized for
a go-slow approach on the issue of global warming.
   The president, receiving only polite applause at the beginning
and end of his address, told delegates to an international
conference on global warming: ``Environmental policies that ignore
the economic factor, the human factor, are destined to failure.''
   Bush repeatedly emphasized the link between environmental
consequences and economic costs. ``All of us must be certain we
preserve our environmental well-being and our economic welfare,''
Bush said. He called these ``two sides of the same coin.''
   However, some delegates to the conference criticized the
administration's cautious approach to dealing with the so-called
greenhouse effect, where pollutants released in the Earth's
atmosphere are believed to trap sunlight and lead to warming of the
planet.
   ``Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide
inaction,'' said West Germany's environmental minister, Klaus
Topfer in a statement.
   He said the White House conference should include debate over
what measures might be taken to curb global-warming pollution.
   Bush told his audience that prominent scientists come down on
both sides of the issue _ some claiming that failure to control
airborne pollutants can lead to series global warming and others
disputing such contentions.
   ``Where does that leave us?'' Bush asked. ``What we need are
facts, the stuff that science is made of.''
   The president's remarks opened a two-day White House conference.
As expected, Bush avoided making a specific commitment in his
remarks.
   Attending the conference were government environmental, economic
and science officials from 18 nations and representatives from
several international organizations.
   ``I know there's a debate raging out there. But I'm confident
that this approach that brings all of you together is the way to
go,'' Bush said.
   Bush cited congressional and White House cooperation on
compromise clean-air legislation as a sign of a U.S. commitment on
cleaning up the environment.
   He said that the debate over global warming ``often generates
more heat than light.''
   Bush, carefully using the phrase ``climate change'' instead of
``global warming,'' told his audience that recognizing the economic
realities of the cost of environmental cleanup ``is in the interest
of every nation here today.''
   Bush said that in developing nations, in particular, curbing
pollution is especially difficult.
   ``In a climate of poverty or persistent economic struggle,
protecting the environment becomes a far more difficult challenge.''
   He added: ``There is no better ally in service of our
environment than strong economies.''
   Some of the European delegates have called for industrial
nations to make specific commitments on controlling so-called
greenhouse pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, but the
administration has refused to go that far.
   The president's science adviser, Allen Bromley, a co-chairman of
the conference, recently criticized those who advocate ``slam-dunk
solutions'' to global warming when uncertainties remain.
   The cautious approach taken by the White House has prompted some
of the delegates to the conference to complain that the gathering
is being used solely to promote the U.S. position on global warming.
   Conference sources said Monday that both the Dutch and West
German governments have complained about the conference agenda
because it focuses exclusively on research efforts and does not
provide an open give-and-take among delegates on possible response
strategies.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl made his displeasure known in
a letter to Bush, according to the sources, who asked not to be
identified. The Dutch complained in letters to senior White House
officials that the participants aren't even given time in open
sessions to address policy options other than additional research.
   ``We want to discuss (a response) policy,'' said Pier Vellinga,
a senior member of the Dutch delegation. The Netherlands and
several other European countries have favored an immediate
commitment by industrial nations to stabilize carbon dioxide
emissions by the year 2000.
   Vellinga said the Europeans have waited eagerly for Bush to
convene the conference, which he promised during his 1988 election
campaign, but they had expected it to focus on responses as well as
research.
   Senior administration officials have emphasized in recent days
that they view the conference as primarily a way to focus on the
need for more research into global warming and to address the
economic questions posed by the issue.
   Representatives to the meeting are senior cabinet-level advisers
on economics, science and the environment from nations that include
the European Community, Japan and Brazil.
   U.S. environmentalists also chastised Bush for not focusing on
pollution control efforts.
   The Sierra Club called the conference an attempt by the
administration to shift the focus away from environmental questions
to economic ones.
   The Sierra Club, which has more than 500,000 members, said
Monday it plans to take that message to the public with a series of
television advertisemets featuring actors such as William Shatner,
John Ritter and Jane Alexander.
   Some computer models have suggested the Earth could warm by 4 to
9 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 60 years because heat is being
trapped by pollution. Other studies, however, questioned whether
the warming would be that severe because of uncertainties about the
effect of clouds, oceans and other factors.

   A citizen group has doubts whether an all-white
jury can deliver justice in the murder trial of a former Houston
police officer accused of killing a black woman.
   Testimony was to begin today in the trial of Alex Gonzales, a
white officer charged in the slaying of Ida Lee Delaney. The jury
of 12 was selected Monday for the trial, which was moved to Dallas
because of publicity.
   ``They could have gotten that jury makeup in Houston. I don't
even know why they came to Dallas to do this,'' said Ada Edwards,
an organizer of the Ida Lee Delaney-Byron Gillum Justice Committee.
Gillum is a black man killed by police in a separate incident.
   ``It's not a surprise. I just hope the process will carry itself
out and that those people are people who will be willing to hear
the entire story,'' Ms. Edwards said.
   ``The state of Texas is very happy with the jury,'' said
prosecutor Don Smyth. ``We think they'll do a fine job. As we've
been telling everybody else, this is not a racial case.''
   Elsewhere, more than 500 people Monday mourned a black teen-ager
fatally shot in the back by a white policeman in Teaneck, N.J.
   A grand jury was to begin hearing evidence in the case today, a
week after Phillip Pannell was killed by an officer responding to
reports that the 16-year-old was brandishing a gun.
   ``No longer will we put up with public officials putting guns in
the hands of people untrained to our needs,'' said Theo Bolden, a
junior at Teaneck High School, speaking at Pannell's funeral at a
Baptist church in Englewood.
   A call for activism came in a letter from Jesse Jackson saying,
``We must transform confusion into order, fear into hope, death
into light.''
   Gonzales, 25, is accused of killing Mrs. Delaney, 50, last fall
while off duty. Mrs. Delaney and Gillum, 24, were shot within two
weeks of each other. The officer suspected of shooting Gillum was
not indicted.
   Mrs. Delaney was driving to work on a freeway when Gonzales and
two other off-duty officers chased her in an unmarked car,
authorities. After she pulled over, Mrs. Delaney and Gonzales
exchanged fire.
   The defense maintains Mrs. Delaney fired first and Gonzales
acted in self-defense.
   The officers had been attending a birthday party at a nightclub
for several hours before the shooting. Hospital records showed
Gonzales was intoxicated when he sought treatment for gunshot
wounds to the abdomen.
   Pannell was shot by Officer Gary Spath. Police said that
officers believed the teen-ager was reaching for a gun and that a
.22-caliber gun was found on the body. Some of the dead boy's
friends have said he had a BB pistol instead.

   The Supreme Court ruled today there is no
constitutional right to take the hallucinogenic drug peyote as a
religious practice.
   The justices, voting 6-3, said Oregon officials may deny
unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who ingested
small amounts of peyote in Indian religious ceremonies.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the First
Amendment does not permit people to break the law in the name of
religious freedom.
   ``We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs
excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting
the conduct that the state is free to regulate,'' he said.
   Oregon's drug laws do not ``regulate religious beliefs, the
communication of religious beliefs or the raising of one's children
in those beliefs,'' Scalia added.
   In a strongly worded dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun accused
the court of treating religious freedom for the first time as a
``luxury'' rather than ``an essential element of liberty.''
   Today's ruling is a signal to Indians that religious freedom for
unorthodox practices is ``an unfulfilled and hollow promise,''
Blackmun said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and
Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor provided the sixth vote to deny the
unemployment benefits to the fired drug counselors.
   But she said in a separate concurring opinion that the five
other justices in the majority went too far in limiting religious
freedom.
   O'Connor said after weighing all the factors, she believes
Oregon has ``a compelling interest'' in outlawing peyote use.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Made it more difficult for employers to withdraw recognition
of a labor union representing striking workers after new employees
are hired to break the strike.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices reinstated a National Labor
Relations Board policy against presuming the new employees oppose
the union.
   _ Ruled that lawsuits charging employers with violating a key
federal anti-bias law may be filed in state as well as federal
courts.
   The 9-0 ruling upheld a $27,000 award won by a Chicago Ridge,
Ill., woman against her trucking company employer, the Yellow
Freight System Co.
   The peyote case was before the nation's highest court for the
second time. The justices in 1988 sent it back to the Oregon
Supreme Court to determine whether the religious use of peyote was
a crime in that state.
   The justices were seeking that guidance, presumably, because if
a state can ban all peyote use outright, it has the power to
withhold unemployment benefits for those who use the drug.
   But the Oregon Supreme Court refused to answer the high court's
question, once again ruling that Oregon may not deny unemployment
compensation for use of peyote in a religious ceremony.
   Unlike Oregon, the federal government and most states exempt
religious use of peyote from their criminal drug laws.
   The fired workers in today's case, Galen W. Black and Alfred C.
Smith, were counselors with the Douglas County, Ore., Council on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT).
   After each took small amounts of peyote as part of a Native
American Church sacrament, they were fired by ADAPT for violating
company policy.
   The rehabilitation program since has changed its policy and now
permits employees to use peyote in religious services.
   Peyote is a cactus ``button'' containing the hallucinogen
mescaline.
   Smith, a Klamath Indian, is a recovered alcoholic who said he
has not taken a drink since 1957.
   Black is not an Indian but converted to the Native American
Church. He worked for ADAPT while recovering from drug and alcohol
abuse.
   State officials have not disputed that both men sincerely
believe peyote is a part of the church's religious practices.
   Lawyers for both men said using small quantities of peyote in a
church service is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities
of wine in Christian religious ceremonies.
   But state officials said that if peyote is permitted in church
ceremonies it will create a wedge for allowing other drugs, such as
marijuana, to be used by other religious groups.
   Oregon officials also argued that creating an exception for
peyote would be a violation of constitutionally required separation
of church and state.
   The case is Oregon Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213.

<HEAD>Report: Lantos Got Free Office Space From Lobby Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, a leader of Congress'
probe into the Department of Housing and Urban Development, got
free office space from a company representing a key figure in the
HUD affair, a published report says.
   The space was provided rent-free by Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., a
major public relations company that is prominent in Washington
lobbying, the San Jose Mercury News reported Sunday. The
Congressional Human Rights Foundation, a private group headed by
Lantos, has used the space since late 1988, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said it investigated the foundation and a
similarly named, taxpayer-supported organization founded by Lantos.
   The California Democrat denied that he had violated ethical or
financial guidelines.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton was hired to represent former federal housing
commissioner Thomas T. Demery before Congress and the news media
after an April 1989 inspector general's report raised suspicions of
possible wrongdoing by him at HUD.
   Lantos' space arrangement with Hill &amp; Knowlton was unknown to
the public when on May 8 he ruled that his House subcommittee would
not question Demery about important aspects of the inspector
general's report.
   Lantos, 62, a member of the House since 1981, terminated an
interview last October and requested that further questions be
submitted in writing, the newspaper said. The Mercury News did so
March 19. In written responses to those questions, the congressman
denied he had violated ethical or financial guidelines.
   Lantos also said his activities involving Hill &amp; Knowlton and
the human rights foundation have not influenced his congressional
decision-making.
   ``The foundation,'' Lantos said, ``is a separate legal entity
reflecting the global human rights concerns of many persons,
including members of Congress. In no way does it affect my official
actions.'' Lantos also is a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Vice Chairman and Managing Director Frank Mankiewicz told the
Mercury News that his firm began providing the free space to
Lantos' foundation because, ``We do some pro bono work, and this
seemed like a worthy cause.''

<HEAD>Court Sets Guidelines for Awarding Interest Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set some new
guidelines for awarding interest payments to winners of antitrust
lawsuits.
   The 5-4 ruling in a case from New Jersey is a partial victory
for both sides in the dispute.
   The case stems from a suit by the former owners of a New Jersey
company who accused Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. of illegal
monopoly practices.
   The former owners of Columbia Metal Culvert Co. in Vineland,
N.J., which made aluminum drainage pipe, said the company was
driven out of business by Kaiser.
   They sued Kaiser in 1974 and eventually were awarded more than
$9.5 million in damages.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled the
ex-owners are entitled to interest on the award from Dec. 2, 1981,
until the award was paid by Kaiser on July 3, 1986.
   The Dec. 2 date is the one on which a federal jury assessed the
damages.
   The Supreme Court today changed that date to Dec. 4, 1981, the
date on which the judgment was formally approved by a federal judge.
   The high court rejected Kaiser's bid to base the interest
payments on a period beginning July 1, 1986, when a federal appeals
court upheld the damage award.
   The justices also rejected arguments by the former owners of the
New Jersey firm who wanted the operative date set at Aug. 16, 1979,
when a federal jury first found Kaiser guilty of antitrust
violations.
   The high court also ordered a lower court to determine the
interest rate to be paid based on the prevailing rate on Dec. 4,
1981.
   The 3rd Circuit court had said the interest should be based on
Treasury bill rates. The appeals court had applied the Treasury
bill rates retroactively _ since it was not until October 1982 that
a federal law mandating the T-bill rate in such cases took effect.
   The high court today barred such retroactive application of the
1981 law.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. She was joined
by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting were Justices Byron R. White, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   The cases are Kaiser Aluminum vs. Bonjorno, 88-1595, and
Bonjorno vs. Kaiser, 88-1771.

   A striking Greyhound driver was jailed
without bail on charges he shot at a bus carrying 30 people, and a
small bomb exploded today at a bus depot in northern California.
   Dennis L. Daniels, 42, was arrested at his home Monday after
being indicted on federal charges of damaging the bus March 9 in
reckless disregard for the safety of passengers and using a firearm
in doing it.
   Daniels was the fourth person arrested for allegedly shooting at
buses since Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenence and
office workers walked out March 2 over wages and job security at
America's only nationwide bus system.
   Three shots were fired at the bus shortly after midnight from a
car on Interstate 71 about 25 miles from Columbus. Neither the
driver nor any of the 29 passengers was injured, and the bus
continued its Columbus-to-Cincinnati trip.
   Daniels was held for a bail hearing on Thursday.
   In northern California, a small bomb exploded early today at the
Greyhound bus depot in downtown Redding, the same building where a
striking Greyhound driver was killed when crushed by a bus in a
March 3 accident.
   The explosion occurred outside the depot near a maintenance
building, and a second bomb was found that did not explode, said
Redding Police officer Bill Horton. He said there were no injuries
and damage appeared minimal.
   On Monday, Greyhound spokeswoman Ann Wheat said a bus in
Falksville, Ala., was fired on Saturday as it traveled to
Birmingham, but the shot missed, and there were no injuries. In
Kansas City, maintenence workers found a bullet embedded in the
radiator of a bus that arrived from St. Louis, Ms. Wheat said.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said there have been 31
shooting attacks involving Greyound and seven injuries since the
strike began. One person was arrested in Connecticut and two were
taken into custody in St. Louis.
   ``Our overall interest is getting the violence stopped,''
Gravley said. ``If more arrests are made, it may be effective in
preventing further violence.''
   Talks between the union and company have ceased and Gravley said
the company will not resume talks until at least a week passes
without violence.
   The seven-day rule means employees ``are being held hostage by
common criminals,'' said union spokesman Jeff Nelson.

   The alleged ringleader in the white-on-black
slaying of a teen-ager boasted he was going to shoot blacks, a
prosecutor charged. But the defense argued the man was falsely
accused by a drug-addicted young woman.
   ``I'll show you she's a contemptible liar. Her mother is a
contemptible liar,'' Stephen Murphy screamed at the jury Monday as
Keith Mondello went on trial for murder in the slaying Aug. 23 in
Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section.
   Yusuf Hawkins, 16, was shot to death after he and three of his
pals, all black, crossed paths with a mob of bat-wielding whites in
the mostly Italian-American neighborhood. The four blacks had gone
to look at a used car.
   The slaying raised racial tensions in the city in the middle of
a mayoral campaign.
   Mondello, who did not shoot Hawkins but allegedly assembled the
white gang, had ``boasted that he would blow the heads off the
nigger bastards,'' Assistant District Attorney James Kohler said.
   ``It didn't matter what black man. Yusuf Hawkins innocently
appeared on the scene, and his fate was sealed,'' the prosecutor
said.
   A second jury sitting in the same courtroom had been scheduled
to hear opening statements today in the murder trial of the accused
gunman, Joseph Fama, but his lawyer was ill and the opening was
postponed.
   Mondello and Fama, both 19, could receive 25 years to life in
prison if convicted.
   Separate juries will hear testimony against the two defendants,
with one panel deciding the fate of Mondello and the other the case
against Fama. Six other whites have been charged in the slaying and
will be tried later.
   Murphy asserted his client was falsely accused by Gina
Feliciano, a key prosecution witness who he said is a habitual liar
and an unreformed drug addict.
   The lawyer said he would play for the jury a secretly recorded
telephone conversation between Miss Feliciano and her sister that
``makes it real clear that the truth has nothing to do with
anything.''
   A copy of the tape provided to reporters later Monday appeared
to shed little new light on the case.
   Murphy said the girl brought on the entire episode by inviting
some black and Hispanic friends to her birthday party in the
neighborhood.

   A court today upheld an order to evict 150
Jewish settlers who rented church-owned buildings in the Christian
quarter of the walled Old City despite protests by Palestinian
Christians.
   The settlement of the Jews under police guard only days before
Easter raised tensions in the Old City, where traditionally
Moslems, Christians and Jews have lived in separate and jealously
guarded neighborhoods.
   The settlers moved into the 72-room complex last Wednesday and
set up the largest Jewish settlement in the Old City, which Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The settlers said the four buildings were sublet to a Panamanian
company, which rented to them. The Greek Orthodox Church contended
the rental to the settlers was illegal.
   Avraham Sochozolsky, a lawyer for the Greek Orthodox Church,
said he would next ask police to carry out the eviction order. It
was not clear, however, whether the settlers would be evicted
immediately from the buildings, which once served as a church
hospice.
   The three-judge panel of the Jerusalem District Court ruled that
a stay of the eviction notice granted Friday by a single District
Court judge was improperly obtained. The action in effect
reinstated the original eviction order issued by a Magistrate's
Court.
   ``The judges have canceled the stay. They (the settlers) must be
evicted,'' Sochozolsky said.
   The lawyers for the settlers said before the decision that they
planned to appeal. They left the court just after the ruling and
were not available for comment.
   The decision came after a four-hour, closed-door session
presided over by Judge Vardimus Zailer. The panel also included
Judge Shalom Brenner, who last Thursday stayed the eviction order.
   On Monday, a group of Jews who ignited angry protests by moving
into the Christian quarter accused Jewish Mayor Teddy Kollek, the
Greek Orthodox Church and other critics of being anti-Semitic.
   Shmuel Evyatar, a spokesman for the Jewish settlers, urged
``everyone in the enlightened world to denounce the horrifying
anti-Semitism to which we are witness.''
   Also Monday, a legislator said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is
exploiting political uncertainty during the formation of a new
government to boost the Jewish presence in the occupied lands.
   Lawmaker Dedi Zucker of the Citizens Rights Movement told The
Associated Press that Shamir has approved preparations for four
more settlements. He said Shamir also gave permission for a Jewish
residential building in the West Bank city of Nablus and for
enlarging the Jewish presence in the West Bank town of Hebron.
   Zucker said Shamir was pushing the government settlement program
at this time because its opponents are now outside his caretaker
government.
   ``Shamir is using the fact that he has nobody to argue with
inside the government,'' Zucker said, referring to the
left-of-center Labor Party that wants to slow down the pace of
settlements.
   Labor governed jointly with Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, but
it left the coalition in a dispute over U.S. peace proposals and
then toppled the government on March 15.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir refused to comment on the
specifics of Zucker's charges. ``Mr. Zucker is the one who is
acting against the national needs of our state, and I don't want to
react to statements by this man,'' Ahimeir said.
   Since capturing the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Arab neighbors
in the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has built 143 settlements,
which are home to about 75,000 Jews. About 1.7 million Palestinians
live in the occupied lands.
   The United States has criticized the settlements as an obstacle
to peace.

   The space shuttle Columbia will be
launched one to two weeks late next month because of the delay in
getting the shuttle Discovery off the ground with the Hubble Space
Telescope, NASA said today.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off May 9 carrying an
astronomical observatory known as Astro. That date is no longer
feasible since Discovery's second launch attempt is not until April
25.
   ``There's a rule of thumb that we like three weeks between
launches,'' said Dick Young, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA wants time to check Discovery following its five-day
mission to see if anything needs to be changed before the next
shuttle's flight. It will wait until Discovery is launched before
setting a new target date for Columbia.
   Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff
April 10 because of a faulty auxiliary power unit. The mission was
postponed 15 days to allow replacement of the power unit and
recharging of Hubble's batteries. Discovery remains on the launch
pad.
   The newly installed power unit will be tested for five minutes
Wednesday. The $1.5 billion telescope, inside Discovery's sealed
payload bay, will not be at risk, NASA said.
   Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries are undergoing 130 hours
of recharging. They will be put back in the telescope on Saturday.
   The telescope is NASA's most expensive and complex payload. Once
in orbit 380 miles high, it will enable astronomers to study stars
and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for
14 billion years.
   Columbia was transferred from the orbiter processing facility to
the Vehicle Assembly Building on Monday. The move was delayed a few
days so technicians could replace a leaking hydraulic part in the
shuttle's nose landing gear.
   NASA plans to roll Columbia out Sunday to the second of the
Kennedy Space Center's two shuttle launch pads.

   The lawyer for a man who sued a hospital for
keeping him alive after he suffered cardiac arrest in 1988, says he
expects the lawsuit to continue despite his client's death.
   Edward H. Winter, 84, died of a stroke Saturday at the
Hillebrand Nursing Center, where he had lived since May 1988.
   Winter's lawyer, William C. Knapp, said Monday he expects family
members to try to recover from St. Francis-St. George Hospital the
$100,000 cost of Winter's nursing home care and damages for his
emotional suffering.
   Legal and medical ethics experts have said the case could break
new ground because hospitals traditionally have not been held
liable for saving lives.
   In the lawsuit filed last year in Hamilton County Common Pleas
Court, Winter said that after a May 25, 1988, heart attack, he
asked the hospital not to take any special measures to keep him
alive.
   He accused St. Francis-St. George staff members of disregarding
his wishes and reviving him after a second heart attack. Two days
later, Winter suffered a stroke that left him unable to walk, talk
or care for himself.
   Winter's daughter, Lynn Kroger, said her father suffered
mentally and physically after the stroke.
   St. Francis-St. George Hospital denies any wrongdoing, and
contends that Winter didn't make clear to hospital staff that he
issued orders not to perform lifesaving measures on him. The
hospital says it respects patients' refusal of such treatment.
   Knapp said the administrator of Winter's estate will decide how
much to seek in damages. No administrator has yet been appointed.
   Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Maker of ``Boo Pumpkin'' Recalls Potentially Hazardous Toy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of a Halloween toy cited for
potential hazards by a consumer group is recalling the novelty
items, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
   Rhode Island-based Easy Aces, Inc. this week recalled 40,000 of
its ``Boo Pumpkin'' toys because, the commission said, parts can
break off ``and pose a fatal choking hazard to yung children.''
   The two-inch, pumpkin-shaped toys were sold nationwide between
August and November 1989. When the pumpkin is squeezed a latex
balloon shaped like a ghost pops out and a squeaker sounds.
   The Americans for Democratic Action Consumer Affairs Committee
said in its annual Holiday Toy Safety report in December 1989 that
the ``Boo Pumpkin'' presents a choking hazard. The pumpkin was
listed among potentially dangerous toys placed near store checkout
counters that consumers may buy on impulse while waiting to pay for
other items.
   Noting ``inhalation of balloon parts is a major source of injury
and death,'' ADA warned the balloon could come off and tempt a
small child to put it in his or her mouth.
   The CPSC recently began the first step of a three-part
rulemaking process that could result in mandatory warning labels
for balloons.
   Consumers should return the toys to the stores where purchased
for a full refund, the commission said.

<HEAD>`The Piano Lesson' by August Wilson Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ghostly ragtime melody floats through the air
at the beginning of August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson.''
   It's a haunting tune that makes the old upright piano in Doaker
Charles' Pittsburgh living room in 1936 come alive with memories of
a past that is very much a part of the present.
   Both past and present are the subjects of ``The Piano Lesson,''
a mesmerizing history of one black family that refuses to give up
either one. The play won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for drama last
week and deservedly so.
   ``The Piano Lesson,'' which opened Monday at Broadway's Walter
Kerr Theater, is another installment in Wilson's decade-by-decade
look at the black experience in American life. And it is Wilson's
most accomplished work to date, resonating with a poetry that
enhances a strong story and illuminates a half dozen or so expertly
drawn characters.
   That piano dominates Wilson's play _ and the stage. It is the
battleground between a brother, Boy Willie, and his sister,
Berniece, both of whom want the family heirloom for their own
purposes.
   Berniece wants to keep the piano, a symbol of the Charles
family's slave days down South. Boy Willie wants to sell it to buy
the land their ancestors worked.
   The conflict between these grandchildren of slaves is revealed
slowly but effectively by Wilson. The playwright is not afraid to
take time to set up scenes and develop characters. His persistence
pays off.
   Wilson traces the piano's history from the time Berniece's
great-grandmother and her grandfather, then age 9, were sold, to
buy the instrument. And how her great-grandfather carved details of
their history into its wood, a lasting memory of its high price.
   Wilson also details how Berniece's father helped steal the piano
from its owners _ and lost his life in the process. And how it
eventually made its way to Pittsburgh and the home of Berniece's
Uncle Doaker.
   Berniece sees the piano as a symbol of her family's survival.
She won't even play it, preferring to let the piano sit as a museum
piece in her uncle's living room. Boy Willie sees it as a means to
a better life. He's not afraid to use the past to build a better
future.
   The past takes on mythic, even supernatural qualities in the
play. In fact, the play ends in an exorcism of the past that pits
Boy Willie against the ghosts of the family that once owned his
forefathers. It's effectively melodramatic if not entirely
convincing.
   Director Lloyd Richards' best moments are small ones, quiet
scenes where the characters reveal their hopes for the future or
funny bits, particularly when one scamp of a character tries to
fleece another man out of money for a suit.
   Charles S. Dutton is a towering Boy Willie, both in size and
spirit. His Boy Willie is alternately ingratiating and calculating,
a man who knows what he wants and won't stop until he gets it. But
he is equally matched by the marvelous S. Epatha Merkerson as the
resolute Berniece. Her dignified determination is quiet but by no
means less effective.
   There are sharply drawn portraits by the other actors including
Rocky Carroll as Boy Willie's naive friend and cohort in crime,
Tommy Hollis as Berniece's suitor, Carl Gordon as the strong,
dignified Uncle Doaker and particularly Lou Myers as an old
reprobate uncle.
   From ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' to ``Fences'' to ``Joe
Turner's Come and Gone,'' Wilson demonstrated an ability to create
specific universes, filled with real people who speak with their
own unique voices. In ``The Piano Lesson,'' these voices make for
memorable theater.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``The Piano Lesson'' is joyously
an African-American play: It has its own spacious poetry, its own
sharp angle on a nation's history and its own palpable ghosts that
roar right through the upstairs window of the household where the
action unfolds.
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: In this play, as in ``Joe
Turner's Come and Gone,'' Wilson is trying to go beyond the poetic
realism of ``Fences,'' into a combination of realism and mysticism.
As yet the attempt seems strained, but Wilson's efforts to find
mystic depths in the everyday are important, because they may help
push the American theater beyond the mingy naturalism in which it
seems so hopelessly mired.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: ``The Piano Lesson'' ... is a play
of magnificent confrontations. ... This is a wonderful play that
lights up man. See it, wonder at it, and recognize it.

   Soviet officials ordered drastic cuts in natural
gas supplies to Lithuania today, putting into force a threatened
economic embargo to break the Baltic republic's drive for
independence, Lithuanians said.
   Soviet officials also plan to cut oil and gasoline to the
republic on Wednesday, Lithuanian officials said. President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev had given Lithuania until Sunday to repeal laws
enacted since the republic's parliament declared independence March
11.
   Lithuanian residents had been forming long lines at gasoline
stations in recent days to fill up for what they feared might be
the last time.
   ``Implementing the orders of the government of the Soviet Union
and those of the state gas concern ... supplies of natural gas ot
the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic will be sharply reduced
from the 17th of April,'' said a telegram sent by a Soviet gas
official to Lithuanian authorities.
   Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Supreme Council,
confirmed the telegram's text, which was broadcast on the
republic's official radio and monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London.
   No official announcement was made immediately in Moscow.
   President Bush said his administration is studying how to
respond if Moscow carries out the threats, but he refused to
elaborate.
   ``We're waiting to see if the Soviet announcements are
implemented,'' Bush said. ``Clearly those announcements are
contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have
urged upon the Soviet Union.
   ``We are considering appropriate responses if these threats are
implemented,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to leave it right there.''
   Teresa Juodenienie, a secretary for Premier Kazimiera
Prunskiene, said in a telephone interview that the Lithuanian
government received a telephone warning from the Druzhba, or
Friendship, enterprise that supplies oil to Lithuania, saying that
deliveries of oil and gasoline will be curtailed beginning
Wednesday.
   She said the telegram announcing the natural gas reduction was
sent only to Lithuania's gas authority rather than to the
government, and that officials did not immediately know whether the
cut already had taken effect and what percentage would be reduced.
   The news came after Lithuania's Parliament convened today to
define a response to Gorbachev's ultimatum threatening an economic
blockade.
   The republic's prime minister sent Gorbachev a telegram on
Monday seeking a meeting to negotiate Moscow's objections to laws
enacted in the Baltic state promoting its March 11 independence
decree.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said Lithuania's leaders
were ready to discuss allowing residents who so desire to remain
Soviet citizens and permitting Lithuanians to join the Soviet army
if they so choose.
   She also expressed a willingness to discuss the protection of
borders.
   ``The main goal of negotiations is to realize independence, or
how the Soviet Union can get out of this situation and out of
Lithuania,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis was quoted
as telling legislators today.
   The parliamentary session was televised live in Lithuania, said
Edwardas Potashinskas of Lithuanian TV, who reported Landsbergis'
remarks.
   Gorbachev on Friday gave Lithuania 48 hours to rescind laws on
those issues or face a cutoff of products the Soviet Union supplies
to the republic. He described as ``unconstitutional'' such
Lithuanian proposals as releasing Lithuanian youth from the annual
spring conscription into the Soviet army and introducing the
republic's own identity cards.
   Gorbachev did not specify what supplies could be cut off, but
Lithuania depends on the Kremlin for oil, gas, machinery, raw
materials, chemicals and automobiles.
   Gorbachev has refused to meet with Lithuanians unless the
republic backs away from its independence declaration and there was
no immediate response to the telegram from Prunskiene.
   In her telegram, Prunskiene said a broad economic boycott would
damage both the Soviet and Lithuanian economies.
   Lithuania's chief of foreign trade, Rimantas Purtulis, told
reporters that gas supplies would last a month and oil three to
four months, according to Daina Kalendra of the Parliament's press
office.
   Lithuania gets its oil and gas from the Soviet Union at prices
much lower than world market prices. The republic has little
foreign currency to buy fuel from the West.
   Some economic sanctions against Lithuania could backfire on the
Soviet Union, journalist Vilius Kavaliauskas quoted one official in
the leadership as saying. Among them:
   _ If Moscow embargoed much-needed chemical fertilizers, that
will mean less meat and dairy products for the 14 other Soviet
republics.
   _ If a natural gas pipeline were shut down, the Russian district
of Kaliningrad wedged between Lithuania and Poland would be hurt.
   _ A cutoff of supplies for the Drob textile mill would also
disrupt deliveries to a Leningrad factory that employs more than
18,000 people.
   Kavaliauskas said his source said the republic has enough
newsprint for four or five days.
   Western correspondents have been barred by Soviet authorities
from Lithuania since last month and the Soviet military has sought
to assert its authority in the republic by seizing and beating
deserters from the army and parading armored vehicles through the
streets.
   Landsbergis said Monday that the other two Baltic republics,
Estonia and Latvia, promised aid in the face of an embargo, but
gave no details, Ms. Kalendra reported.
   The three Baltic states were forcibly annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940. Latvia and Estonia also are seeking independence,
but moving more cautiously.

<HEAD>Justice Department Seeks Records of 754 Bank Accounts in Drug
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department today sought records of
754 U.S. bank accounts that it says once contained $400 million in
illegal drug profits amassed by Colombian drug lords.
   The cepartment asked federal judges in Atlanta, New York and
Miami to direct 173 banks in 23 states to produce records of the
accounts.
   Prosecutors also sought to freeze 684 accounts, which they said
were linked to Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was extradited last
September from Colombia to face charges of laundering money for the
Medellin cartel.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that the
action was the fourth phase in the Justice Department's longrunning
Operation Polar Cap investigation of Colombian cocaine trafficking
in this country.
   The action ``seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the
financial network of these narco-terrorists, including Pablo
Escobar and Jorge Ochoa,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   Operation Polar Cap, conducted by the Drug Enforcement
Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies,
determined that the cartel made $1.2 billion selling cocaine on
American streets between 1987 and 1989, officials said.
   Through a complicated set of wire transfers involving banks in
eight foreign countries, $400 million ended up in the banks from
which the records are being sought, officials said. Other money was
invested in foreign countries or was used to buy supplies and
equipment for cocaine production, officials said.
   Justice Department trial attorney Peter G. Djinis said
investigators traced the money ``dollar for dollar'' through banks
in Colombia, Panama, Uruguay, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Britain,
Canada and Austria.
   Investigators have been reviewing the bank records for almost a
year with the cooperation of the eight foreign governments.
   Officials said they do not know how much of the $400 million
remains in the accounts. But Djinis said the records are expected
to help investigators continue their pursuit of the international
money trail left by the cocaine dealers.
   `We think this is going to point fingers in a lot of
directions,'' he said, and could help investigators identify
additional assets of the Colombian cartel as well as individuals
involved in its illegal activities.
   The Justice Department believes the records will confirm
suspicions that the cartel bought real estate in this country, he
said.
   Most of the accounts were located in Miami and New York because
many of the people who used them lived in those cities, Djinis said.
   Many of the accounts were kept in the name of Martinez and
others were held for nominees, including the 2-year-old daughter of
a member of the cartel.
   The funds were kept in U.S. banks to finance the purchase of
airplanes, equipment and ``to keep up the payroll,'' Djinis said.
   ``The only way to administer these activities is to have ongoing
capital in the U.S,'' he said.
   There was no evidence the banks in which the accounts were kept
were ``anything other than unwitting service providers,'' said
David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman.
   But Djinis said a review of the bank records may lead
investigators to a different conclusion. ``We are not ruling out
anything,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``we are not at this time suggesting the
banks had knowledge and were knowing and willing participants in
the return of the funds to the U.S.''

<HEAD>Nordic Council Drops Soviet Visit Because Lithuania Excluded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the five-nation Nordic Council
on Tuesday canceled a visit to the Soviet Union because they were
barred from going into Lithuania, the Norwegian news agency NTB
reported.
   The decision appeared to be a rebuke of Moscow's plans to use
economic sanctions to force an end to Lithuania's independence
drive, said NTB.
   ``It is a shame that the planned trip cannot be carried out, and
it is a shame that the Soviets are subjecting Lithuania to such a
hard ride,'' said Bjarne Moerk Eiden, a member of the council
leadership.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev invited a delegation from
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland to visit the Soviet
Union for a week in May.
   The council requested stops in the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, but Moscow said a visit to Lithuania would be
difficult, NTB said.
   ``It had to be all the Baltic states, or no tour at all,'' said
Anders Talleraas, a Norwegian representative.
   The three Baltic republic were forcibly annexed by the Kremlin
in 1940. Lithuania declared itself independent March 11.

<TEXT>
   Nepal's first opposition-led government
in almost 30 years will be sworn in this week to rule the Himalayan
nation until free elections are held, an opposition leader said
today.
   Prime Minister designate K.P. Bhattarai made the announcement
after he and another opposition leader, Ganesh Man Singh, met with
King Birendra at the royal palace. The Cabinet will be sworn in on
Thursday, he said.
   Bhattarai said the names of ministers or their portfolios have
not been finalized but only two members of the 11-member Cabinet
will be appointed by the once all-powerful king.
   Four members, including the prime minister, will be from the
Nepali Congress Party, led by Singh, and three from the United Left
Front coalition. The two parties led Nepal's democracy movement,
which surged on Feb. 18. There will also be two independents.
   One minister will be a woman, Left Front chairman Sahana
Pradhan, Bhattarai said.
   The interim government will be Nepal's first opposition
government in almost three decades. Elections have yet to be
scheduled but on Monday Singh said they would be held by April next
year.
   The Nepali Congress in 1959 formed the country's first
democratically elected government, which lasted only 20 months
before Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed it, accusing it
of corruption and poor administration.
   Mahendra banned political parties, introduced a new constitution
and ruled the country through a rubber stamp government and the
partyless Rashtriya Panchayat, or National Assembly.
   Birendra legalized political parties on April 8 after a people's
movement brought the country to a standstill with strikes and
demonstrations. On Monday he agreed to dismiss the National
Assembly and allow the opposition to lead the interim government.
   Bhattarai, 65, was Parliament speaker in the 1959-60 government.
He was jailed for nine years immediately after Mahendra's action.
He spent five more years in jail during different periods for
political agitation.
   Birendra ``was very happy with the proposed Cabinet and told us
he wanted to cooperate and help us,'' Bhattarai said.
   Bhattarai quoted the king as saying his nominees will ``never
impede the work you have undertaken. They are there just to smooth
operations.''
   He said the prime minister will have the freedom to allot
portfolios, including those to the king's nominees.
   Bhattarai will be sworn in by Birendra at the Narayan-hiti royal
palace. The prime minister will then administer the oath of office
to his Cabinet colleagues at the Singh Durbar where the secretariat
is housed.
   Many of Nepal's 17 million people regard the king as the
reincarnation of a Hindu god.

<HEAD>Bush Warns Moscow on Lithuania</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 3-4 with Bush comments in interview</NOTE>

   President Bush today warned Moscow that the
United States would make ``appropriate responses'' if the Soviet
Union carries out a threat to cut back drastically on natural gas
and other fuel supplies to Lithuania.
   Bush refused to say what steps might be taken. ``We are
considering appropriate responses if these threats are
implemented,'' Bush said.
   In an interview Monday with a group of foreign journalists, the
president said, ``I want to be sure anything we do is productive.
There's been dramatic change in the world and I don't want to
inadvertently take some action that would set it back.''
   ``And yet, I don't want to be seen as one who is not interested
in the peaceful change and in the self-determination for
Lithuania,'' Bush said in the interview. A transcript of his
remarks was released today.
   Bush issued his warning after Soviet officials ordered sharp
cuts in natural gas supplies to Lithuania and said reductions in
oil and gasoline will begin on Wednesday.
   ``Obviously we are watching the situation very, very closely,''
Bush said, commenting during a picture-taking session in the Oval
Office with visiting President Rafael Callejas of Honduras.
   ``We're waiting to see if the Soviet announcements are
implemented,'' Bush said. ``Clearly those announcements are
contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have
urged upon the Soviet Union.
   ``We are considering appropriate responses if these threats are
implemented,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to leave it right there.''
   Bush concluded by saying, ``What we need is dialogue, discussion
and a peaceful resolution of this great difficulty there.''
   The president planned to meet on the subject later in the day
with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who led a
Senate delegation to Moscow last week, and Minority leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan. Both lawmakers have criticized the Soviet ultimatum.
   Dole said Congress might act on its own to retaliate
economically against Moscow if it escalated its efforts to block
Lithuania's drive toward independence.
   Mitchell said Gorbachev's threat was contrary to the assurances
that he and other senators had received from the Soviet leader in
Moscow that force or intimidation would not be used.
   The president has repeatedly warned that Soviet pressures
against Lithuania put U.S.-Soviet relations at risk.
   At a news conference last Friday, Bush told Moscow that ``now is
no time for escalation. It's time for talk.'' He made the comment
after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev set a 48-hour deadline
for Lithuania to revoke legislation it had passed since its March
11 declaration of independence, or face cutoff of critical supplies.
   In recent weeks, high-level U.S. officials have been meeting to
consider what steps the administration might take in response to
various Soviet actions against Lithuania. Most of the options
apparently involve economic measures, such as denying Moscow
improved trade status or blocking its entry into international
economic organizations.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Oklahoma teachers abandoned
their classrooms to protest the failure of a school funding bill,
and union officials called for more teachers to join the walkout
today.
   Many of the teachers picketed at the state Capitol on Monday,
and hundreds swarmed the halls, lobbying for the failed $230
million education package. Hundreds returned to the Capitol today
to walk a picket line.
   Some school administrators supported the walkout; others opposed
it.
   The Oklahoma City School Board today oted to used a leftover
snow day to allow teachers to join the protest Thursday. Oklahoma
City schools _ the second largest district in the state with 38,000
students _ were open Monday.
   ``In order for us to make this work our numbers need to grow
each day,'' Kyle Dahlem, president of the Oklahoma Education
Association, said Monday as the union kicked off a five-day teacher
walkout.
   Speaking at the Capitol, Ms. Dahlem called for the closing of
more schools throughout the week and demonstrations at the Capitol
and local schools.
   Nancy Jewell, union vice president, estimated that more than
10,000 took part in Monday's protest at the Capitol. Other
estimates ranged up from 5,000.
   The union called the walkout after the Oklahoma Senate failed
last week to pass the school bill as an emergency measure, which
would have put it into effect immediately.
   The union today said it thought the strike was gaining strength.
Spokeswoman Carla Feeley said 139 of the state's 606 school
districts were closed today, down from the more than 145 closed
Monday.
   But she said more teachers from districts that remain open have
joined the strike. She estimated that 18,600 teachers, or 60
percent of the union's 31,000 members, are participating in the
walkout.
   The state had 40,052 teachers in the 1988-89 school year.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon asked Attorney General Robert Henry to go to
court if necessary to prevent illegal strike activity. Henry said
state law forbidding strikes against school boards did not appear
to apply in the case of a walkout to protest legislative action.
   Bellmon had opposed the strike, although he backs the education
package.
   ``The decision by a significant number of Oklahoma teachers,
administrators and school board members to interrupt the
educational process is deeply regretted,'' Bellmon said.
   The Tulsa school district, the largest in the state, was closed
Monday and again today.
   Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison said there were
discussions over the weekend about reviving the school bill.
   The education package _ the end product of an eight-month
special session _ provides an additional $212 million in funding
for schools, and sponsors said much of the money could be used to
upgrade teacher pay.
   Teachers say their pay ranks 48th in the nation. Under the bill,
the minimum pay for a beginning teacher with a bachelor's degree
would go from about $15,000 a year to about $24,000 a year.
   Much of the opposition was stirred by the plan for taxes to
support the reforms, including a half-cent increase in the state's
4-cent sales tax and increases in corporate and personal income
taxes.

   Two Canadian air force fighter
jets collided near this southwestern city today, killing one pilot
and showering the area with flaming debris, police said.
   The second pilot landed in his ejector seat on a busy highway,
the A5 autobahn, and his condition was not immediately known.
Police spokesman Manfred Frey said he could not confirm earlier
reports the pilot was hit by a car.
   Fire officials and police rushed to put out small fires started
by the falling aircraft debris. At least two people on the ground
were slightly injured, police said. Much of the debris landed near
the train station.
   ``Luckily, damage (on the ground) was minimal,'' because the
area where the planes crashed is not densely populated, a police
spokesman said.
   Baerbel Newman, a spokeswoman for the Canadian air force in
Lahr, said the planes crashed at about 4:10 p.m., south of
Karlsruhe. She confirmed that one pilot was killed and the second
was injured.
   ``One of them is alive, but in what condition, I don't know,''
she said.
   Police identified the aircraft as American-made F-18s. They had
taken off from a base near Rastatt, about 25 miles southwest of
Karlsruhe, police said. The Canadian air force has 48 F-18s at the
base south of Karlsruhe.

<HEAD>GAO: Next 50 Years to Bring Bigger Timber Harvests, Fewer Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National timber harvests will increase 55
percent over the next half century but industry employment will
fall an average of 27 percent because of saw-mill modernization,
the government said Tuesday.
   The South will feel the greatest effect of the modernization,
losing an estimated 36 percent of its timber industry jobs in the
next 50 years, the General Accounting Office said.
   Elsewhere, the report said, employment was expected to fall 26
percent in the Rocky Mountain region, 23 percent in the North and
13 percent on the Pacific Coast.
   However, the South is expected to post the largest harvest
increase over the next five decades _ from about 8 billion cubic
feet to nearly 14 billion cubic feet.
   The North is expected to nearly double its 1986 harvest of 4
billion cubic feet by 2040, while the Pacific Coast and Rocky
Mountain regions are forecast to show only slight gains from their
1986 levels, to about 6 billion and 2 billion cubic feet
respectively.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., requested the GAO report, much of
which was presented to lawmakers in testimony before the House Ways
and Means Committee last month. The regional statistics and
supplemental information were made public this week.
   Chester Joy, a GAO evaluator, said the projections were based on
U.S. policy at the time the study began in October. It does not
take into account proposed changes in Pacific Northwest logging in
an effort to save the northern spotted owl from extinction.
   Timber was the nation's No. 1 agricultural crop in 1986,
composing about one-fourth of the total value of all major crops.
   Timber harvesting increased 4 percent from 1986, to 17.6 billion
cubic feet in 1988, while the number of acres planted and seeded
annually increased 23 percent from 1986, to 3.39 million in 1988.

<HEAD>Government Approves Anti-Viral Aid for Kidney Transplant Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved a new biological product to help protect kidney transplant
patients from a potentially fatal infection.
   The product, Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin Intravenous, or
CMV-IGIV, contains cytomegalovirus antibodies, giving the patient
the ability to fight CMV infections that can be carried by donated
kidneys, the FDA said.
   The virus is common in the United States and is usually
harmless. But when it is carried by a donated kidney, transplant
patients often are unable to fight its uncontrolled spread to other
critical organs because their immune systems have been weakened
with drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ.
   The infections are serious in transplant patients and can be
fatal.
   The new product will enlarge the pool of donated kidneys
available to people who have no cytomegalovirus antibodies. People
who have been infected with the virus earlier in their lives
already have the antibodies necessary to ward off CMV infection and
do not need CMV-IGIV, the FDA said.
   The immune globulin has been available for transplant patients
since October 1987 under the FDA's program to investigate new
drugs, which allows patients with serious or life-threatening
conditions to get experimental drugs.
   CMV-IGIV has no major side effects, but it has been associated
with flushing, chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea,
vomiting and wheezing in a small number of patients, the FDA said.
It should not be given to patients sensitive to immunoglobulin A,
the agency said.
   The product was developed under the FDA's orphan drug program by
the Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories of Jamaica
Plain, Mass. The program provides financial incentives to develop
therapies for serious but rare diseases.
   The product is being distributed by the American Red Cross,
Northeast Region, which can be contacted in Massachusetts at
617-461-0891.

Study</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court left unresolved today a
conflict between federal agencies and their employees' unions
stemming from the government policy of ``contracting out'' _ buying
certain goods and services from private businesses.
   The justices said a dispute between the Internal Revenue Service
and a federal employee union should be restudied by a federal
appeals court or by the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   The FLRA resolves collective bargaining disputes between federal
agencies and their employees.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court struck down a FLRA ruling that would
have forced agencies to negotiate with unions over how to resolve
contracting-out disputes.
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that the authority
wrongly ruled the IRS must negotiate with the National Treasury
Employees Union over a contract proposal to submit contracting-out
disputes to arbitration.
   ``We do not lightly overturn the FLRA's construction of the act
(the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978) it is charged with
administering,'' Scalia said. ``However, we conclude that the
FLRA's construction is not reasonable.''
   But Scalia said the court was leaving unanswered whether some
other legal basis exists for forcing agencies to negotiate over
such contract proposals.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   The case is IRS vs. FLRA, 88-2123.

   The attorney for Joseph Hazelwood has filed
notice that the former Exxon Valdez skipper will appeal his
conviction on one count of negligent discharge of oil.
   Hazelwood was acquitted by a Superior Court jury on March 22 of
more serious charges that he had been drunk and reckless when the
tanker ran aground on a reef in Prince William Sound.
   The grounding resulted in the nation's worst oil spill. Nearly
11 million gallons of crude oil gushed into the waters and along
hundreds of miles of shorelines.
   The notice off appeal was sent late last week from Fairbanks and
arrived at Superior Court on Monday. After the court certifies the
notice, defense attorneys have 30 days to file the appeal brief.
   Dick Madson, a defense attorney based in Fairbanks, said the
appeal will argue that Hazelwood was immune from prosecution
because of federal and state laws that protect ship captains from
prosecution if they immediately report a spill.
   Hazelwood was ordered to pay $50,000 restitution and to perform
1,000 hours of community service cleaning the waterway.

   Housing starts continued to fall in March from
their January peak, the government reported Tuesday, but many
analysts said the decline had bottomed out.
   The Commerce Department reported that starts of new homes and
apartments fell 9.3 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.32 million units _ a pace many analysts said
probably would continue.
   ``We might see levels like we had in March during most of the
rest of the year,'' said economist Thomas Holloway of the Mortgage
Bankers Association.
   The drop was the sharpest since a 12.4 percent plunge in January
1989, but was expected after starts jumped 23.2 percent to an
annual rate of 1.57 million units during January's record warm
weather.
   They slipped to 1.46 million in February, still well above the
level of the last 11 months of 1989 as unusually warm weather
continued.
   ``It isn't so much that housing is plunging as it is a
correction in the data to the bulge earlier this year which
couldn't be sustained,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for The
Boston Co.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, noted that all of the decline was in single-family
homes, which fell 12 percent to an annual rate of 1.02 million
units.
   Nevertheless, Berson added, the March rate ``still is a very
good number, better than most months of 1989.'' Single-family
starts totaled 1 million last year.
   On the other hand, multifamily starts gained 0.9 percent to an
annual rate of 306,000 _ ``up a tad, but still at an abysmally low
number,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders.
   Apartment starts plunged 35.3 percent in February after a 37.1
percent jump the previous month. In addition to the weather,
analysts had attributed the January gain to builders wanting to get
construction under way before expensive new regulations designed to
make apartments more accessible to the handicapped went into effect.
   Seiders blamed the ``incredible weakness'' in apartment starts
on fair housing regulations for the handicapped that he said would
add as much as $3,000 to the cost of multifamily units and on a
construction credit crunch brought on by the August savings and
loan bailout law.
   The biggest decline in starts was experienced the Northeast,
where the real estate industry has been in the doldrums in recent
months. They were down 37.8 percent, to 138,000 units, after
advancing 32.1 percent in February.
   ``We though we had seen hopeful signs'' in the Northeast,
Seiders said, ``but it clearly was a temporary, weather-based
effect. Now it's showing it is the weakest housing component in the
country.''
   Other declines were posted in the South, down 11.5 percent to
524,000 units, and the West, down 0.5 percent to 376,000 units.
   The Midwest registered the only gain, up 6.8 percent to 293,000
units.
   Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
housing activity, fell 7.6 percent after dropping 25.2 percent the
previous month.
   The 1.21 million applications were the lowest since 1.15 million
permits were sought in October 1982.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PEYOTE
   
   The court ruled there is no constitutional right to take the
hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice.
   The justices, voting 6-3, said Oregon officials may deny
unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who ingested
small amounts of peyote in Indian religious ceremonies.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the First
Amendment does not permit people to break the law in the name of
religious freedom.
   In a strongly worded dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun accused
the court of treating religious freedom for the first time as a
``luxury'' rather than ``an essential element of liberty.''
   The case is Oregon Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213.
   
   STRIKES
   
   The court made it more difficult for employers to withdraw
recognition of a labor union representing striking workers after
new employees are hired to break the strike.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices reinstated a National Labor
Relations Board policy against presuming the new employees oppose
the union.
   The case is NLRB vs. Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc., 88-1685.
   
   JOB BIAS
   
   The court ruled that lawsuits charging employers with violating
a key federal anti-bias law may be filed in state as well as
federal courts.
   The 9-0 ruling upheld a $27,000 award won by a Chicago Ridge,
Ill., woman against her trucking company employer, the Yellow
Freight System Co.
   The case is Yellow Freight System vs. Donnelly, 89-431.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court set some new guidelines for awarding interest payments
to winners of antitrust lawsuits.
   The 5-4 ruling in a case from New Jersey stems from a suit by
the former owners of Columbia Metal Culvert Co. in Vineland who

<HEAD>If You Don't Want to Stick Your Neck Out, Pick Red Neckties</HEAD>

   They are the staple neckwear of presidents,
politicians and power brokers. They brighten drab suits and look
great on TV. They are to establishment businessmen what Sansabelt
slacks are to golfers.
   At a time when the variety of men's neckties has never been
greater, people are seeing red _ the traditional, risk-free hue for
ties, no matter if they come with polka dots, paisleys, prints,
patterns, stripes or geometric designs.
   ``Red is the brightest color that goes with all men's suits in a
business environment,'' said tie-designer Alan Flusser, who created
the neckwear for Michael Douglas in ``Wall Street,'' the tale of
yuppie greed in the 1980s.
   ``It gives new life to somber, conservative business suits,'' he
said.
   But be advised. Flusser's personal tie rack is devoid of red.
The reasoning is similar to what Yogi Berra once said about a
nightspot being too popular: ``Nobody goes there anymore. It's too
crowded.''
   ``Red is too obvious a color,'' said Flusser, whose only
concession to red are his luxurious, woven Jacquards in claret,
burgundy or bordeaux.
   But in places like the nation's capital, crimson is red hot in
the corridors of power.
   President Bush favors them. TV anchormen love them, and ABC's
Sam Donaldson wears red ties so often they've become a personal
trademark. Donald Trump flashes them the same way he runs business
_ unblushingly.
   Some trace red's staying power to the 1988 presidential
campaign, when politicians out-did themselves to prove their
red-blooded patriotism without sticking their necks out.
   ``I saw one Democratic debate when all seven of the candidates
had a blue suit, white shirt and red tie. It was like a uniform,''
said Bob Beauchamp, fashion editor for Esquire magazine.
   The necktie is the only part of a man's wardrobe that has no
function other than to decorate.
   The average man owns 30 to 40 ties, although only 10 to 15 of
them are worn regularly, according to the Neckware Association of
America, a New York-based industry trade group. It said about 95
million are sold each year, and red can be found more than any
other color.
   ``A tie allows room for self-expression,'' said the
association's Jerry Anderson. ``It's probably the most noticeable
item he wears. It says more about your personality than a suit or a
shirt.''
   Fashion forecasters note the mainstream tie is widening from 3{
to 3} inches. Some risk-takers are even pushing the 4-inch barrier,
Anderson said.
   And for those who are bloody tired of red, take heart. The
latest look is called retro, for retrospective, a back to the
future concept that revives the splashy patterns of the Forties and
Fifties.
   ``You've had a conservative look for a number of years,''
Anderson said. ``Men want to look fresh and different. It's time
for a change.''
   The new look is embodied by hipster Arsenio Hall or the trendy
characters on ``L.A. Law'' or ``thirtysomething.'' Bruce Mertz,
president of Format Inc., a Chicago company that makes retro ties,
has already buried power ties, even the trendy, teal-colored hues.
   ``If you see a guy wearing a yellow tie, he's really out of
fashion. He hasn't bought a new necktie. He's sleeping,'' Mertz
told the Chicago Tribune. ``They're gone. Finished. You don't see
anybody wearing them.''
   Meanwhile, New York tie designer Joseph Abboud would rather be
dead than red.
   ``Men fall into safety zones. They see somebody else wearing
red, so they wear it too. They all look like airline pilots,'' said
Abboud, who makes ties for NBC's Bryant Gumbel.
   ``I think we've got to get the politicans to be a little more
daring,'' he said. ``Red lacks originality or individuality. It's
archaic. It's old news. You run the risk of being extremely boring
and repetitive.
   ``I'm not telling people to wear naked ladies on their tie. But
they can be freer and not as regimented. My whole goal is to design
ties for a man who's a leader, not a follower, someone willing to
step out and be his own man,'' Abboud said.
   Now, about those black socks.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices surged an unexpectedly sharp
0.5 percent in March, pushing the inflation rate for the first
three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight years,
the government reported today.
   The Labor Department blamed last month's increase in the
Consumer Price Index in large part on a jump in housing costs and
another surge in new clothing prices, although there were
widespread increases in a variety of retail areas.
   The 0.5 percent rise matched February's gain and followed a 1.1
percent increase in January.
   Private economists were caught by surprise by the brisk March
advance, which they termed a disappointing sign that inflation was
not slowing as they had hoped. Many analysts had been looking for a
modest increase of around 0.2 percent.
   ``The CPI shows an entrenched, unacceptably high rate of
inflation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``The inflation result was dangerous and potentially devastating
for financial markets and the economy.''
   Through the first three months of the year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 8.5 percent. That is the fastest
quarterly increase since the spring of 1982 and is far above the
4.6 percent price increase for all of 1989.
   Today's bad inflation news was likely to strengthen the resolve
of the Federal Reserve to resist pressures from the Bush
administration to lower interest rates. Sinai predicted that if
inflation does not retreat soon, the Fed may even begin pushing
interest rates upward, something it has not done for over a year,
in an effort to dampen price pressures.
   ``The message is that it may take more pain, more restraint on
the economy, to get inflation down to acceptable levels,'' he said.
   In other economic reports today, the government reported that
industrial production rose 0.7 percent in March while the nation's
factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.3 percent of
capacity, an increase of 0.4 percentage point, reflecting a rebound
in auto production.
   However, housing construction fell by 9.3 percent, its second
monthly decline and the biggest setback in more than a year. The
Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being built
at an annual rate of 1.32 million units in March.
   On Wall Street, stock prices posted broad declines with traders
attributing the weakness to the higher-than-expected inflation
figure, which dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve might relent
and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off more than
13 points in early trading but by 1 p.m. had recouped some of the
losses and was down by 4.73 points.
   In the inflation report, housing costs climbed 0.5 percent in
March, pushed upward by a sharp 1 percent rise in the cost of
owning a home. Homeowners' cost had actually fallen 0.1 percent in
February.
   The advance in housing costs accounted for almost one-half of
the overall March increase.
   Higher clothing costs contributed to more than one-fifth of the
increase as apparel prices rose by 1.6 percent, following a record
3.3 percent increase in February.
   Many economists had been looking for prices to moderate in
March, aided by lower food and energy costs.
   Energy prices were down during the month, dropping by 0.8
percent, pushed lower by falling gasoline prices and another big
drop in home heating oil costs.
   Food prices rose 0.4 percent during the month, slightly better
than the 0.5 percent increase in February, as a big drop in fruit
and vegetable prices offset increase in other areas.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up
sharply as well in March, climbing 0.7 percent, the fastest
increase since a 0.8 percent rise in December. Economists believe
this core rate is a better gauge of underlying inflationary
pressures.
   The 8.5 percent annual rate of increase for the first three
months of the year was the fastest advance since a 10.1 percent
increase in the spring of 1982.
   Rising food prices accounted for about one-fourth of the price
acceleration so far this year.
   Clothing costs, which rose just 1 percent for all of 1989, were
up at an annual rate of 21.4 percent during the first three months
of this year.
   The department gave the following details of the price report:
   _Fruit and vegetable costs, which had been driven higher by
December's killer freeze, retreated slightly in March but prices
for meat, poultry, fish and eggs were up by 0.7 percent.
   _Gasoline prices fell by 1.4 percent, the first decline this
year, while heating oil prices dropped by 3.4 percent following a
16.1 percent plunge in February. Fuel oil costs have been on a
roller coaster this year, surging 26.9 percent in January in
response to unusually cold weather in December.
   _The 1.6 percent increase in clothing costs was led by a 2.7
percent increase in the cost of women's and children's clothing.
Men's clothing costs were up 0.6 percent.
   The various changes left the Consumer Price Index at 128.7
before seasonal adjustments. That meant that a hypothetical
selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base
period would have cost $128.70 last month, up from $122.50 a year
ago.
   One reason the 0.5 percent March increase took analysts by
surprise was that it followed a more benign report on inflation at
the wholesale level. The government reported last Friday that
prices one step short of retail actually fell by 0.2 percent in
March.

   A bomb exploded near a nuclear power
plant in western India today, killing a woman, a news agency
reported.
   The blast occurred near the Tarapur power plant, 70 miles north
of Bombay on the Indian Ocean, Press Trust of India news agency
said.
   Another bomb-like object was found nearby, it said. No further
details were immediately available and there was no claim of
responsibility.
   Federal officials in the Interior Ministry, which overlooks
internal security, said security was stepped up today around all
important government buildings and installations, including nuclear
power plants.
   The decision came after fire heavily damaged the government's
main conference center in New Delhi. United News of India said a
Sikh separatist group, Khalistan Liberation Force, claimed
responsibility for setting the blaze.

<HEAD>Clashes Rage In Moslem, Christian Sectors of Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Street battles raged Tuesday in the
Moslem and Christian sectors of Beirut, sparked by separate power
struggles for control of the Shiite Moslem and Maronite Christian
communities.
   Clashes also broke out in the southern port of Sidon between the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army and the leftist Nasserite
militia. Police said one Nasserite militiaman was killed and two
were wounded.
   Police said at least seven people were killed and 38 wounded in
fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions using machine guns,
assault rifles and grenade launchers in Syrian-policed west Beirut
and the city's southern slums.
   Some of the clashes were in the Hajjaj neighborhood in south
Beirut, one block from the barracks believed to be the most
frequent prison for 18 Western hostages. It was not known if the
fighting affected the captives.
   The barracks belong to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, the umbrella group for factions believed to hold most of the
hostages.
   The Shiite clashes later spread to south Lebanon's Iqlim
el-Tuffah, or Apple Province, where four people were wounded,
according to police.
   In the Christian sector of east Beirut, troops loyal to Gen.
Michel Aoun and Lebanese Forces militia chieftain Samir Geagea
skirmished with mortars and machine guns. No casualties were
reported. The rival Maronite Christian factions are fighting for
control of the Christian enclave north and east of Beirut.
   According to police, 875 people have been killed and 2,376
wounded since the Christian battles began Jan. 30.
   The Shiite confrontation pits the fundamentalist Hezbollah
against the Syrian-backed, more secular Amal militia. The militias
are fighting for control of Lebanon's Shiites.
   The latest clashes erupted a day after Ali Abu Hassan, an Amal
leader, was killed by unidentified assailants in west Beirut. Amal
blamed the killing on Hezbollah, which denied the charge.
   Amal fighters raided west Beirut homes overnight, seizing some
Hezbollah members in apparent revenge.
   Each side blamed the other for the latest round of fighting,
which started in west Beirut around 4 a.m. and spread to the
southern slums by noon.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, pleaded with both
factions to ``stop fighting immediately and have mercy on the
population.''
   The Syrian command deployed foot patrols in an effort to
disengage the combatants but met with limited success.
   ``They stop fighting when the Syrian patrol is in an area and
resume their war after the patrols leave,'' said a police spokesman.
   However, he said the Syrians appear ``determined to halt the
fighting'' and were bringing in more troops to establish control in
the disputed districts.
   The Syrians control most of Lebanon with about 40,000 troops
sent under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Voice of the Nation, the main Moslem radio station in Lebanon,
repeatedly broadcast urgent appeals from hospitals for blood
donations and pleas from civilians for a cease-fire.
   ``Let them go to hell. Why do we have to pay the price for their
dirty war?'' said one civilian, Amina Ghandour. Ghandour told the
radio station that the fighting had left three floors of her
apartment building on fire.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting sporadically for more than
two years for leadership of the country's 1.2 million Shiites,
Lebanon's largest sect. In the fighting in south Lebanon, police
said fighters of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army clashed with
members of the Nasserite militia, which controls Sidon. The sides
battled for three hours in the hills east of Sidon.
   Also in Sidon, police said an unidentified gunman went berserk,
storming into a business office with a submachine gun. The
assailant killed three employees and wounded two before killing
himself. The motive for the attack was not known.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Mayor Blasts Lack of Drug Funding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode said Tuesday
the federal government has mixed up its priorities by planning to
spend billions of dollars more on bailing out the savings and loan
industry than on fighting illegal drugs.
   ``For some reason we can't get the people who list priorities to
put this above savings and loans,'' Goode told a House hearing on
the narcotics problem. ``The lives of our young people are more
important than these buildings and these investors who put money in
savings and loans.''
   Goode, testifying for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, called for
more federal funding to stem demand for narcotics, grants provided
directly to city governments and freedom for local officials ``to
respond to the drug crisis based upon their own particular
experiences and insights.''
   He urged a greater emphasis on treatment for drug abusers. He
said he visited ``the 25 worst drug corners'' in Philadelphia last
year and was repeatedly told by addicts, ``We need some way to get
off this train _ I got caught up in this by mistake, and now I need
something that works.''
   Goode told the Government Operations Committee the $10.2 billion
earmarked in recent legislation to fight drugs ``is simply not
enough to have a meaningful impact across the entire nation.''
   Instead, he said, federal funding should match the amount the
government will pay to combat the financial calamities besetting
the savings and loan industry. Estimates of that cost have ranged
up to $200 billion.
   He also criticized the idea of legalizing narcotics, a concept
that has gained currency in recent months among those who believe
that the problem is so overwhelming that a war against it is
virtually guaranteed to fail.
   Goode called it ``a very bad idea that some very smart people
are lending their endorsement to.'' He said legalization would
flood the nation with narcotics and set an ``inappropriate moral
tone.''
   ``This would be the worst domestic policy decision that we as a
nation could make _ bar none,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Says Nuclear Regulatory Commission Must Establish Training
Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must
establish training requirements for workers in the nuclear power
industry, an appeals court said today.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the NRC has circumvented
a congressional mandate by failing to adopt regulations called for
in a 1983 law.
   A presidential panel examining the accident at Three Mile Island
said inadequate training contributed significantly to the risks
posed by nuclear power plants, the court noted in its opinion.
   The NRC issued a policy statement in 1985 which encourages but
does not compel nuclear plant operators to create training programs.
   The NRC concluded that the best way to get civilian nuclear
power plants to improve training was to create a model training
code and urge utilities to comply with it voluntarily.
   Public Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader, challenged the
NRC's approach in lawsuits in 1986 and 1988. The NRC reconsidered
the training issue in 1988 and decided not to impose requirements.
   ``Congress directed the NRC to create mandatory requirements for
civilian nuclear powerplant licensee personnel training programs
and ... the commission has failed to do so,'' said the 3-0 decision
by chief appeals court judge Patricia Wald.
   The case was returned to the NRC for further proceedings
consistent with the court ruling.
   The 1983 law, an amendment to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, says
the NRC ``shall establish ... instructional requirements for
civilian nuclear powerplant licensee personnel training programs.''
   The NRC relied on other language in the amendment which allows
the agency to issue ``appropriate ... regulatory guidance.''
   The appeals court said that while the term ``regulatory
guidance'' is ambiguous, other language mandating the instructional
requirements is clear and controls the issue.
   The NRC and the industry argued that imposing mandatory
requirements will make the nuclear power industry less safe because
it will choke off the industry's self-regulatory efforts.
   The argument is that the companies will regard the NRC's
requirements as a maximum rather than a minimum level of
appropriate training.
   The NRC and the industry ``must take this argument to the
Congress, not to the courts,'' said the appeals panel.
   Voluntary industry training was under way at the time Congress
passed the law and the NRC's model training code ``is exactly what
Congress did not want to perpetuate,'' said David Vladeck, an
attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation Group.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Governor Defends Veto of Rape Education Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson defended his veto of
a bill requiring public schools to teach students about date rape,
saying younger pupils didn't need exposure to such lessons.
   The bill, passed during the Legislature's winter session, called
for instruction three times between the first and 12th grade on how
to recognize and prevent sexual assaults, particularly those that
can happen with an acquaintance on a date.
   In vetoing the bill Monday, the governor said he feared it could
force teachers to talk about date rape to children between grades
one and three. ``I didn't know these students dated,'' he said.
   Thompson said he also believed the bill duplicated a state law
that ``already requires school districts to provide instruction in
preventing sexual abuse, of which sexual assault could be argued to
be a subcategory.''
   He noted that he recently signed a law requiring the University
of Wisconsin System and Vocational, Technical and Adult Education
System to teach incoming freshmen how to avoid sexual assault.
   He also expressed concern that a provision in the bill requiring
the state to pay a ``sum sufficient'' to cover the lessons would
``give school boards a blank check.''
   Milwaukee County Assistant District Attorney John DiMotto, head
of his office's sexual assault unit, criticized the veto.
   Although the schools teach sexual-assault awareness and
prevention, DiMotto said, ``there is nothing that specifically
addresses the issue of date rape, which can and does affect many
youths.''
   DiMotto said about 35 percent of the sexual assaults handled by
his unit involved acquaintances of the victims.
   Linda Willsey, committee clerk for state Rep. Barbara Notestein,
who sponsored the bill, said the governor was confused about
existing law.
   ``There is a protective behavior statute,'' Ms. Willsey said.
``But it applies to elementary school students only. ... Our
concern mainly was with acquaintance rape and sexual assault among
teen-agers and high school kids.''
   According to Ms. Notestein, about half of the 5,100 sexual
assaults reported in Wisconsin in 1987 involved teen-age girls.

   One-third of the Senate candidates this year
got more money from out-of-state individuals than they did from
local contributors, according to the Federal Election Commission.
   The commission also said Monday that 17 of the 31 incumbent
senators seeking re-election raised more individual contributions
of at least $200 from out-of-state residents than from state
residents.
   Some non-incumbent candidates also received more $200-plus
donations from out-of-state individuals than from state residents,
particularly in states where the current senator is not seeking
re-election.
   While it still is early in the campaign, the 23 Senate
candidates raising most of their individual contributions from
out-of-state are below the number who did in 1988 and 1986.
   In 1988, 29 of the 66 candidates for 33 Senate seats received
more campaign funds through individual contributions of $500 or
more from outside than at home. In 1986, 31 of the 68 candidates
for 34 seats did the same.
   The commission cautioned that the data does not include
contributions from business, labor and special interest political
action committees or PACs. Also not reflected is smaller
contributions _ less than $200 per individual last year and less
than $500 in the 1987-88 and 1985-86 election cycles.
   Two incumbent candidates already have raised more than $1
million in large individual donations from outside their states.
Leading the pack is incumbent Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who has
raised $1.34 million outside his state or about triple the $462,331
from in-state donors of $200 or more.
   Close behind is Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., with nearly $1.3
million in large out-of-state contributions compared with $474,569
from New Jersey residents.
   Former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke has raised three times as
much in large contributions from outside Louisiana than inside the
state in seeking the Republican nomination to challenge veteran
Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston. But Duke's total campaign
receipts of $138,063 are dwarfed by Johnston's campaign chest of
nearly $1.3 million.
   Another state where the incumbent senator is stepping down and
large out-of-state contributions are playing a role is New
Hampshire. Former Democratic Sen. John Durkin and Republican lawyer
Tom Christo have both raised more through $200-plus contributions
outside the state than within in bids for their parties'
nominations to fill the seat being vacated by Republican Sen.
Gordon Humphrey.
   Other incumbent senators whose large out-of-state contributions
_ listed first _ in 1989 exceeded those from within the state _
listed second _ include:
   Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, $141,696, $30,776; Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
$511,950, $76,262; Paul Simon, D-Ill., $720,082, $681,681; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, $635,485, $66,225; William S. Cohen, R-Maine,
$273,475; $32,700; John Kerry, D-Mass., $643,144, $556,229; Carl
Levin, D-Mich., $964,022, $414,485;
   Max Baucus, D-Mont., $312,508, $72,148; Pete V. Domenici,
R-N.M., $254,998, $233,166; David Boren, D-Okla., $382,454,
$377,670; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., $63,219; $43,080; Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., $350,568, $12,723; Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., $512,917,
$228,348.
   Both incumbent Republican Sen. Larry Pressler and Democratic
challenger Ted Muenster have raised more money through large
individual contributions from outside South Dakota than from the
state's residents.
   Pressler has received $365,521 from the outside compared with
large individual donations totaling $20,550 from within it.
Muenster has raised $73,400 in large contributions from outside the
state compared with $22,550 in similarly sized donations from South
Dakota residents.

   Rep. Barney Frank today announced he will seek
re-election, although a congressional ethics committee has yet to
release a report on questions surrounding his relationship with a
male prostitute.
   The Democrat initially said he would make a decision after the
report was released. But in a statement released by his office, he
said the political calendar pushed him to make a decision
beforehand.
   Frank, who in 1987 became the first member of Congress to
voluntarily disclose being homosexual, said the report is not yet
available and the deadline for nominating petitions is May 8.
   No other Democrats have announced for the seat. The Republican
Party has only been able to field two little-known candidates.
   Frank, 50, who represents the Fourth Congressional District in
suburban Boston, was first elected to his seat in 1980. He has one
of the most liberal voting records in Congress.
   The Washington Times first reported Frank's relationship with a
male prostitute last August. It quoted a source as saying that
Frank not only hired a prostitute for sex but was aware that a
prostitution ring was being run out of his Capitol Hill apartment.
   Within days, Frank identified Stephen Gobie as the man he hired
for $80 in 1985 for sex. He apologized for ``poor judgment'' but
denied knowing about the prostitution ring. He said he fired Gobie
in 1986 after learning of the ring.
   On Sept. 11, the House ethics committee voted to conduct a
preliminary investigation of Frank. Although Frank had formally
sought the investigation, the committee chairman, Rep. Julian
Dixon, D-Calif., told reporters that the decision ``was not based
on his request,'' but on the panel's own initiative.
   The Hous ethics committee plans to meet Thursday in a closed
session. A committee spokeswoman gave no indication whether Frank's
case would be on the agenda.

   No definite plans have been made for an
expected visit to the Soviet Union by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
because the Soviets haven't suggested a date, the Pentagon
spokesman said Tuesday.
   At the end of an October tour of U.S. military facilities,
Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov invited Cheney to visit the Soviet
Union. There have been ongoing exchanges in recent years between
the two nations' military and defense leaders.
   The trip was expected to occur sometime this summer, but no date
has been announced.
   Last month, the Bush administration called off a scheduled visit
to the Soviet Union by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono, calling
the trip inappropriate amid the tensions over Lithuania.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, queried at a briefing about
Cheney's invitation, told reporters that no firm date had been
offered by the Soviets and that there were no plans for Cheney make
such a trip ``on the near horizon.''
   However, Williams added, ``We are eager to do so.''
   Besides meeting with Cheney at the Pentagon, Yazov visited Camp
Pendleton, a Marine training base north of San Diego; Luke Air
Force Base in Arizona; and Fort Bragg, home of the Army's 82nd
Airborne in Fayetteville, N.C.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called for more research ``to
sort out the science'' of global warming Tuesday, but ran into a
storm of criticism at an international White House conference from
Europeans who argued for action.
   ``Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide
inaction,'' declared Klaus Topfer, the West German environmental
minister.
   Bush said he hoped the conference, attended by delegates from 19
nations, would prod international research and inject economic
issues into the debate over the ``greenhouse'' effect.
   The president called for resolving some of the scientific
uncertainties and economic implications before making a commitment
to specific pollution controls to deal with possible gradual
warming of the Earth.
   ``Environmental policies that ignores the economic factors _ the
human factors _ are destined to fail,'' he said, maintaining anew
that some scientists are in wide disagreement over the impact of
manmade pollutants on the temperature of the globe.
   Many of the European participants, especially the West Germans
and the Dutch, said the conference agenda was narrowly arranged to
prevent open discussions of policy aimed at dealing with global
warming.
   Topfer suggested the German delegation would pursue such
discussions, adding, ``The gravity of the situation requires
immediate, determined action.''
   Similar views were expressed by members of other delegations,
including Dutch and French officials.
   Discussions about further research and economic considerations
should ``not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide
stabilization now,'' Hans Alders, the Dutch environmental minister,
told the conference during a closed working session.
   ``We needed Love Canal before hazardous waste was tackled. We
needed a dying River Rhine before waste water was treated. ... My
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on
global warming now,'' Alders told the delegates, according to a
transcript made public by the Dutch delegation.
   ``I know there's a debate raging out there,'' Bush said in his
welcoming remarks to the delegates, all Cabinet-level ministers
involved in environmental, economic and science issues. But he said
he was confident that more research and examination of economic
factors before action to curb ``greenhouse'' pollutants such as
carbon dioxide ``is the way to go.''
   Scientists, including Bush's own science advisers, generally
agree that manmade pollution, especially the release of carbon
dioxide from burning of fossil fuels, is causing heat to be trapped
and will result in a warming of the globe. Many say the Earth's
temperature could increase by as much as 4 degrees to 9 degrees
Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, causing coastal
flooding and a shift of weather and agriculture patterns.
   Environmentalists have urged immediate action by industrial
countries to curb carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and many
of the European countries have called at least for a stabilization
of such releases by the year 2000. Such a commitment would require
new efforts at energy conservation, development of more fuel
efficient automobiles and more efficient use of energy in homes and
businesses.
   Meanwhile, U.S. environmentalists accused Bush on Tuesday of
abandoning his leadership responsibilities on the global warming
question by not joining the Europeans in a call for firm
commitments to reduce global warming pollutants.
   ``Bush is using the conference as a smoke screen to hide his
inaction. He's using economics as a weapon against environmental
protection,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.
   Rafe Pomerance, of the World Resources Institute, chided Bush
for suggesting that scientists are at opposite poles on the global
warming debate. He said there is widespread agreement that the
earth will become warmer if pollution curbs are not put into effect.
   At a luncheon address to the conference, William Reilly, head of
the Environmental Protection Agency, maintained the Bush
administration has taken actions to combat global warming.
   He cited the push to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which are another major cause of global warming; a call by Bush to
plant 1 billion trees a year, and efforts to toughen federal air
pollution laws, as well as a $1 billion global change research
effort.
   But environmentalists maintained the tree planting effort will
have scant effect on overall carbon dioxide pollution and that the
administration vigorously fought efforts in Congress to require
automakers to develop more fuel efficient cars, which would have
allowed for significant carbon dioxide reductions by the end of the
decade. Federal money to foster energy efficiency and renewable
fuels also remains below the levels of a decade ago, they said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Hazardous Waste at Nuclear Plant Illegally Stored</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS third graf to CORRECT time element.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats weapons plant stored hazardous
waste illegally for a decade by claiming it was being saved for
recycling, a federal judge has ruled, apparently making the plant
subject to state regulations.
   ``This takes a big step toward making clear what they can and
cannot store and what is and is not hazardous waste,'' said Maggie
Fox of the Sierra Club, which sued the U.S. Department of Energy
over storage of the material at the plant.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock, which was
issued Thursday but did not become publicly known until Monday,
does not call for fines or other penalties.
   But it apparently will force the plant to meet state
hazardous-waste regulations on storage of ash and other residue
left over from waste incineration.
   The plant shut down its incinerator last year as part of the
lawsuit, but for years it had burned waste tainted with radioactive
plutonium.
   Plant operators had argued that the resulting ash was exempt
from state regulation because the plant was storing the material
for recycling of the plutonium it contained.
   Court records showed that plutonium actually was recovered from
less than 10 percent of the tons of residue stored.
   Triggers for nuclear weapons were assembled at the plant, but
most of the plant's plutonium-related operations have been shut
down since late last year, partly for a seasonal inventory and
partly because of technical problems.
   Energy Department attorneys argued that any ruling designating
the residue as regulated waste would jeopardize an agreement with
the state over the handling, storage and generation of hazardous
waste at the plant.
   John Haggard, Rocky Flats program coordinator of the Colorado
Department of Health, said the ruling strengthens the state's
authority to regulate the waste.

<HEAD>Sullivan Wants 9.9 Percent Increase in Medicare Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan is recommending a 9.9 percent increase in Medicare
payments to physicians for the 1991 fiscal year, his office said
Tuesday.
   The recommendation to Congress is ``a realistic goal for
physicians, one consistent with both the prudent practice of
medicine and the necessary restraint on cost increases,'' Sullivan
said.
   Medicare payments to physicians have been growing by 12 percent
a year in recent years, about double the rate of inflation.
   Under legislation passed by Congress last year, the secretary
must recommend annually a Medicare physician payment target.
Congress is to review the recommendation and set a Medicare Volume
Performance Standard. If Congress does not act, the law provides
for the performance standard to be determined based on a specified
formula.
   The new law changes the way Medicare pays physicians by
realigning reimbursement rates, increasing them for family and
internal physicians and reducing them for surgeons and other
specialized physicians.
   The performance standard will be the main factor used to
determine future annual Medicare fee increases to physicians. The
new system of physician payments will be phased in beginning in
January 1992.
   In recommending a physician payment goal, the secretary takes
into account such things as general inflation, the increase in the
number of Medicare beneficiaries and changes in technology.
   The 9.9 percent overall rates of increase includes an 8.7
percent growth rate for surgical services and 10.5 percent growth
rate for all other physician services.

   The San Francisco Water Department, citing
low reservoirs, called for mandatory water rationing to cut use by
25 percent for its 2.2 million customers.
   The department's recommendation Monday proposes the same formula
used during the 1988 drought year, based on 1987 usage.
   ``Anybody who was in the program last time will be getting the
same allotment,'' said John Mullane, acting director of the
department.
   The recommendation heads to the Public Utilities Commission next
week. If approved, rationing probably would begin May 1, according
to Mullane.
   Mullane, who noted reservoirs are only at 38 percent of
capacity, said rationing is necessary to guarantee enough water to
get through another dry winter.
   Supplies also will be cut by 25 percent for the 32 suburban
agencies in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda counties that buy
water from San Francisco. However, those agencies have the option
of creating their own rationing plan.
   The Santa Clara Valley Water District adopted mandatory
rationing that began on April 1. The East Bay Municipal Utility
District has turned to voluntary conservation.

   President Bush defended the practice of
appointing an American general as supreme commander of NATO, saying
it underscores the important role the United States plays in
preserving peace in Europe.
   On another European issue, Bush said he had given no thought to
dealing with a possible Labor government in Great Britain. He
shrugged off polls that indicate British voters have turned against
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative government.
   Bush was interviewed Monday by four correspondents from
newspapers in France, Great Britain and Canada. The White House
released the transcript Tuesday.
   Bush, who will consult Thursday with French President Francois
Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., was asked if he could envision a
French supreme commander of NATO. Although France belongs to the
16-nation alliance, it does not participate in its integrated
military structure.
   ``We're very happy with the present arrangements,'' Bush
replied. ``I don't want to have this coming out in a chauvinistic
sense, but I think the American people have to feel ... the
American presence is wanted.''
   Keeping an American in charge of NATO's military command
``contributes to the view that we have an important role to play
and the Europeans want us to have an important role to play,'' Bush
said.
   ``I've given no thought to any substantive change in all of
this. But if anybody has a different view, I'd be willing to hear
it.''
   Bush, who last week conferred with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney in Toronto and with Mrs. Thatcher in Bermuda, said he was
meeting with Mitterrand in part to ``narrow any differences that
might exist'' between France and the United States on the future of
NATO.
   ``It is my conviction that NATO will have a perhaps even more
important role to play in the stability of Europe,'' Bush said.
   Mitterrand ``has a keen interest'' in a role for the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation forum spanning
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Bush said. But he added, ``I know
we're not egregiously apart at all.''
   Bush sought to brush aside questions about whether he could deal
with Britain's Labor party if it ousts the Thatcher government.
   ``I don't want to get into the bubbling cauldron of domestic
politics inside the U.K. right now,'' Bush said.
   He said he had not ``given any thought to'' dealing with the
Labor Party.
   ``We do have a special relationship (with Britain) and it'll
continue, I'm sure'' regardless of who occupies 10 Downing Street,
he said.
   He dismissed Mrs. Thatcher's low standing in polls, citing his
own low ratings early in the 1988 campaign and the recent polling
fiasco that indicated Daniel Ortega would win Nicaragua's
presidential election.
   ``I'm enough of a politician to know that people can be down one
moment and then soaring like an eagle the next,'' Bush said.
   He called Mrs. Thatcher ``a very courageous, principled leader
who fights for her beliefs and has survived many ups and downs.''
   Bush refused to express an opinion on Quebec's separatist
movement, saying he would ``courageously sit on the sidelines'' on
that question.
   The United States, he said, should not ``involve itself in the
internal affairs of Canada.''

   There will be an adequate supply of physicians
and most other health professionals through the end of the century
but the shortage of nurses is expected to worsen, the government
said Tuesday.
   The number of registered nurses has grown from 750,000 in 1970
to more than 1.6 million in 1988, according to a report sent to
Congress by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   However, even though the number is expected to continue to
increase over the next 15 years, it will not be enough to alleviate
the shortages, the report said.
   Public health experts say the nursing shortage has been caused
in part because of population growth and because hospital patients
tend to be sicker these days and need more intensive care.
   In many other health professions, the supply is growing but the
rate of growth is expected to slow between 2000 and 2020 because
the number of people leaving the workforce will be greater than the
number entering, the report said.
   Minorities, it said, are underrepresented in health professions.
   Black and Hispanic physicians make up 3 percent each of the
total number of doctors although blacks constitute 12 percent of
the total U.S. population and Hispanics 7 percent, the report said.
   Sullivan pointed to Newark, N.J., as an example of the
``geographic maldistribution of health professionals.''
   In that city, he said, there are three times as many
office-based primary-care physicians per 100,000 people in
non-poverty areas as in poverty areas.

   President Bush praised Honduras today for a
``productive role'' in bringing about a peace agreement in
Nicaragua and voiced strong U.S. support for helping to demobilize
and resettle Contra rebels.
   Administration officials have been waging a heavy lobbying
campaign to get Congress to act on the president's $800 million aid
package for Central America, calling further delay an affront to
U.S. allies in the region.
   Bush, speaking after a White House meeting with Honduran
President Rafael L. Callejas, called the Honduran government ``an
inspiring example of the democratic promise that today is spreading
throughout the Americas.''
   ``The United States applauds Honduras' productive role in
achieving a multilateral agreement on the peaceful demobilization
and repatriation of the Nicaraguan resistance in conditions of
safety for all concerned,'' Bush said. It was a reference to the
peace process that ended the war between the U.S.-backed Contras
and the marxist Sandinista government.
   Callejas, calling the 1980s ``a complicated decade for Central
America,'' said that the present decade must be one of economic
rebuilding.
   ``It is impossible to have democracy without economic
development,'' he said, speaking after Bush during a departure
ceremony outside the White House.
   Both Bush and Callejas praised an economic package being put
together by the United States, Japan and international lending
organizations to help Honduras refinance some of its huge
international debt.
   The meeting came at a time when the administration has been
turning up the heat on Congress to pass its aid package for
Nicaragua and Panama.
   Administration officials say that stalling the aid package
beyond the April 25 inauguration of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
President-elect Violeta Chamorro would be a foreign policy
embarrassment.
   It also would be a burden on the government of Honduras, a
longtime U.S. ally, the officials say. Many of the Contra rebels
the United States hopes to resettle remain in camps in Honduras.
   Also on the agenda at today's Bush-Callejas meeting was the
status of efforts by the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the United States and Japan to help Honduras ease its large
international debt.
   Addressing a White House audience on Latin American issues
Monday, Bush said Congress _ which returns from its Easter-Passover
recess on Wednesday _ was wrong to not provide the funds before the
break.
   ``I have pledged to Mrs. Chamorro that the United States
government would respond in Nicaragua's hour of need,'' the
president said.
   ``I believe the United States of America has a great deal at
stake in the success of Violeta Chamorro, but more so in democracy
itself in Nicaragua,'' he added.
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters at the
White House on the condition of anonymity, said: ``It would be a
very unfortunate message for the Congress to send to Mrs. Chamorro
not to have this on the president's desk by her inauguration.''
   ``Time is wasting. To cut this package and reduce it supposedly
to help some other part of the world would be a historic mistake,''
the official said.
   The administration's package, bogged down in Congress, calls for
$500 million for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua.
   The House increased the package to $2.4 billion, adding money
for U.S. projects including food stamps, disaster relief, fighting
forest fires and veterans' programs. The Senate has yet to act on
the legislation.
   Many members have called for expanding the package to include
more aid for emerging Eastern European democracies.
   The administration said last week that it would rechannel about
$3.6 million in already appropriated funds to help a joint United
Nations-Organization of American States team begin demobilizing
Contra rebels now encamped in Honduras.
   However, the senior administration official said, ``There are
some 45,000 family members of the resistance who will remain in
Honduras as refugees. They want to go home.''
   Bush's $300 million request for Nicaragua includes $47 million
for resettling Contra fighters and families now in Honduras.
   ``If that money is not available, the ability of the Central
Americans and Mrs. Chamorro to help this process move along is
going to be crippled. It would burden Honduras with a burden it
should not have at this time. They've been very patient for many
years,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Study Says Five Countries Develop Nuclear Capability Through
Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan, India, Brazil, Argentina and Iraq
have been able to build or expand nuclear weapons capabilities by
smuggling materials from supplier countries, according to a private
study released Tuesday.
   To counter these activities, the report recommends that the
United States and other suppliers threaten military and economic
sanctions against countries engaging in such operations.
   Titled ``Nuclear Exports: The Challenge of Control,'' the report
was prepared by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
private research group. It was written by Leonard Spector, a
veteran expert on nuclear proliferation, with assistance from
Jacqueline Smith.
   The report said West Germany has been the ``weak link'' in the
international export control system and must tighten its export
laws. Both India and Pakistan have relied on West German suppliers
for their nuclear programs, the report said.
   Shortly before the report was released, the new head of Brazil's
nuclear energy commission, Jose Luis de Carvalho Santana, said
Brazil will not build a nuclear bomb. But he declined to say
whether it had the technical ability to do so.
   Argentina has repeatedly proclaimed the right to develop and
explode a nuclear device even though experts claim it seems far
from being able to achieve that goal.
   Three weeks ago, Iraq denied any intention of developing nuclear
weapons and reaffirmed that denial on Monday. It said devices
described by U.S. prosecutors as nuclear warhead detonation
capacitors allegedly being smuggled to Baghdad were to be used in a
non-nuclear university laser project.
   In mid-March, British investigators arrested four people they
claimed had tried to smuggle these devices to Iraq.
   President Saddam Hussein has expressed concern in recent days
about a possible nuclear attack by Israel against his country. The
report lists Israel among countries where there is a
``proliferation concern.''
   Of the five countries the report focuses on, it said Iraq's
program was far behind those of the other four.
   The report said in some instances, agents of the five countries
have engaged in simple smuggling _ ``for example, by attempting to
export commodities without required export licenses or by making
blatantly false declarations on export documents.''
   In other cases, it said, these agents have been able to minimize
any suspect characteristics of the commodities at issue, taking
advantage of a relaxed attitude by licensing officials or
exploiting gaps in export regulations.
   If controls had been enforced effectively, Spector said, it is
possible ``Pakistan would not be able to manufacture nuclear
weapons today, that India's nuclear weapons potential would be a
fraction of its current size and that neither Argentina nor Brazil
would have facilities capable of producing nuclear weapons
material.''
   Supplier countries should retaliate against nuclear smuggling by
threatening reduced aid, military sales restrictions or economic
sanctions, the report said.
   It recommended that traditional nuclear suppliers ensure
rigorous enforcement of their common nuclear export guidelines.
   Prosecuting individuals involved in nuclear smuggling, while
essential, ``neither reaches the source of the problem nor imposes
unacceptable costs on nations that seek to undermine the
international nuclear control regime,'' the study said.
   ``Indeed, many of these states continue to enjoy the fruits of
their illicit nuclear purchasing operations even after they have
been exposed,'' it said.
   Other recommendations included:
   _Finding ways to recover illicitly acquired nuclear commodities
or to ensure that they do not contribute to nuclear weapons
programs.
   _Publicizing nuclear smuggling operations more frequently. ``The
embarrassment of publicity serves at least as a mild sanction
against states engaged in such operations and also serves to
chastise the commercial firms that aid them,'' the report said.

   A 22-year-old woman committed suicide by
driving her car into the Thames River from a downtown park, almost
four years after her twin sister killed herself in the same way in
the same place.
   Michelle A. McDonald drowned Monday, according to Dr. Said
Esfahanian, an assistant state medical examiner.
   Her body was not found until about six hours later, police said.
City and federal emergency rescue crews, including eight divers,
combed the river.
   Ms. McDonald's twin sister, Melissa McDonald, then 19, drove her
car into the river near the spot on July 29, 1986. Police ruled
that death a suicide.
   Michelle McDonald was obsessed with suicide and always said that
when she died she would die as her sister did, according to Deborah
Labrie, her roommate.
   ``I know it preyed on Michelle's mind all of the time,'' Ms.
Labrie said.

<HEAD>Former State Democrat Chairman Acquitted in Bribery Case</HEAD>

   A federal judge on Tuesday acquitted a former state
Democratic Party chairman on charges he participated in a scheme to
bribe Dominican Republic officials to release seized drug planes.
   The case against Alfredo Duran went awry in the past month after
a co-defendant was revealed to be a Drug Enforcement Administration
informant, and a chief prosecution witness turned out to be a
lawyer who failed to inform clients he was secretly cooperating
with federal investigators.
   Democratic officials at the time of the November indictment
called it a political vendetta by U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, a
former Republican state senator whose wife is a Republican
congresswoman.
   On Tuesday, before the defense was to present its case, U.S.
District Judge James Kehoe ordered Duran acquitted, saying the
government had failed to prove the charges against him were a crime
under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   ``I feel that I have been thoroughly vindicated,'' said Duran,
53, who could have faced a maximum five years in prison if
convicted. He was state party chairman during 1976-80.
   His lawyer, Donald Bierman, played down any political angle in
the case.
   ``I think that it was a very poorly thought out prosecution, but
I don't personally believe it was political,'' said Bierman.
   The judge refused a government request to stay the acquittal
while prosecutors appealed, and Bierman said the judge's decision
in such cases is final.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for Lehtinen, denied any political
motivation behind Duran's indictment. She said of the verdict: ``We
are disappointed, but we have every faith in the criminal justice
system.''
   The indictment had charged that Duran took money from attorney
Jose Insua and co-defendant Robert Gurin, and was to pass it to
retired Dominican Gen. Joaquin Pou, who would see that government
officials there released the planes.
   Gurin pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government, and
Pou's aide, Jose Guasch, also later pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiring to break the corrupt practices act.
   But Pou jumped bond, fleeing to his homeland and telling the
media there he was a DEA informant who was betrayed by the U.S.
government.
   Last week, the judge agreed with the defense that all evidence
concerning Pou should be excluded from the case, crippling the
prosecution.
   Insua, in turn, was attacked by the defense because he set up a
sting operation against Duran and Pou after becoming involved in
another criminal investigation. Attorneys said that was an ethical
violation by both Insua and the U.S. attorney's office, because the
lawyer's clients were never informed their attorney was working
with prosecutors.
   With much of the evidence excluded, Kehoe ruled that there was
no evidence the money had left the United States, as required under
the 1977 law, and ordered the acquittal.

   The Justice Department on Tuesday sought
records of 754 U.S. bank accounts where it said Colombia's Medellin
cartel has stashed $400 million from cocaine sales on American
streets.
   The action marks the first time thaAssociated Presst federal authorities
traced
``dollar for dollar'' drug money from U.S. street sales that was
laundered through foreign accounts and returned to American banks,
officials said.
   The department asked federal judges in Atlanta, Miami and New
York to order 173 banks in 22 states and the nation's capital to
turn over the records that officials said could yield a wealth of
financial information about the cartel.
   Federal prosecutors also asked an Atlanta judge to freeze 684
accounts linked to Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was extradited in
September to face charges he laundered drug money for the cartel.
   The legal action is likely to produce more information than
money, but should help investigators continue theNazi death camps.
   ``Of course, we know the pictures from home, but it has a
different meaning here,'' said cellist Alexander Wedow, 56, who has
been with the orchestra for 28 years.
   ``It goes very deep into your soul. It is a deep sadness,'' said
oboe player Hansjoerg Schellenberger, 42. ``This can always happen
again. Mankind has this black part in its soul.''
   Some musicians said they had been somewhat apprehensive about
audience reaction before their first concert, and that they were
overwhelmed by the standing ovations after each performance.
   Among those cheering were several elderly German-born Israelis
who are often torn between pride in the culture of their youth and
hatred of the Nazis who uprooted them and killed their families.
   Alfred Frankenstein, 84, who fled Berlin in 1935, said the
sounds of Schubert and Brahms brought back the days when he covered
the orchestra as a music critic.
   ``An old man likes to relive the beautiful moments of his youth,
and this was one of them. The faces (of the musicians) have
changed, but the Berlin Philharmonic remains one of the best
orchestras,'' said Frankenstein.
   The warm welcome is the latest sign that while the Holocaust
still shapes Israeli attitudes, there is less sensitivity about old
taboos, in part because a new Israeli generation has emerged with
no direct experience of Nazi rule.
   Earlier this year, Gottfried Wagner, the great-grandson of 19th
century German composer Richard Wagner, toured Israel to push for
the lifting of a boycott on the music of Wagner.
   He won support from Israel's music establishment, and Ron said
Barenboim was trying to put together a Wagner concert with the
Israel Philharmonic this fall. Orchestra officials said they were
unaware of any such efforts.

<HEAD>Art Curator Ouster Prompts Donor to Pull Collection, Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ouster of a curator at the small
but innovative Berkshire Museum has set off a furor, with one donor
changing his mind about donating $2 million and his photograph
collection.
   ``I am appalled that the museum could cut a curator so sympatico
to the arts,'' Connecticut collector George R. Rinhart said of the
dismissal of art curator Debra Balken.
   Rinhart owns one of the largest private collections of American
photographs. It includes more than a million prints dating from the
1830s to the 1960s, including Civil War scenes by Matthew Brady,
along with a reference library of at least 20,000 volumes.
   Museum director Barry Dressel said Monday that Rinhart's threat
wasn't as dire as it seemed because he never had received any
written guarantees that the bequests were final.
   ``Basically we have only the word from a donor that ... when he
dies in 30 years he is going to leave this collection and an
endowment to the museum,'' said Dressel.
   ``Would we love to have that collection? Sure. But it was a
conclusion of the trustees and me that basically there was little
to assume,'' he said.
   However, others have said they also have changed their minds
about donations to the museum.
   Balken could not be reached for comment; she is not listed in
directory information. She declined comment earlier to the
newspaper.
   Balken, who came to the Berkshire Museum in 1981, has been
praised for bringing exciting exhibitions to the museum and for her
expertise in the field of modern and contemporary art. But she also
has been criticized for exhibitions that weren't received well by
some sections of the community.
   Last week, museum officials announced that Balken's job had been
consolidated in an ``administrative restructuring.'' Trustees said
the museum will create an administrative post of director of
curatorial programs, and will contract with guest curators for
individual exhibits.
   The decision was made by Dressel and approved unanimously by the
11 trustees present.
   Rinhart was not at home Tuesday and not available for additional
comment.
   He told The Berkshire Eagle last week he had changed his mind
about his intended gifts, including an endowment that could have
provided $100,000 annual income.
   ``I only came out of my turtle shell because of the outrage I
feel about the way Debra was treated,'' he said. ``A sensitive,
intelligent human being is being treated as an ornament no longer
in vogue.''
   In the wake of the museum changes, a donor has canceled plans to
donate three paintings by 19th century landscape painter George
Innes.
   And Ellsworth Kelly, of Spencertown, N.Y., who has donated work
to the museum, said he will not give any more.
   George Heard Hamilton, professor emeritus of art at Williams
College and former director of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art
Institute, resigned from the Berkshire Museum's collections
committee on account of the ouster of Balken.
   Dressel said the reaction hasn't shaken trustees' conviction
they needed to replace Balken.
   ``We've had virtually no cancellation of membership. Our funders
are not unhappy,'' Dressel said. ``The museum is certainly not
rocked or sinking by this change.''

<HEAD>Inflation Rate Rising at Fastest Pace Since 1982</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices, fueled by sharp increases in
clothing, housing and medical costs, shot up 0.5 percent in March
to push inflation to the highest level since 1982, the government
said Tuesday.
   Private economists saw the unexpectedly brisk advance in the
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index as a discouraging sign that
inflation was not retreating as they had hoped.
   The inflation rate is ``dangerous and potentially devastating
for financial markets and the economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   Through the first three months of the year, inflation has risen
at an annual rate of 8.5 percent, the fastest quarterly increase
since a 10.1 percent increase in the spring of 1982.
   Part of the surge earlier in the year was attributed to an
unusually cold December that froze crops along the Gulf Coast and
sent fuel oil prices skyward. But March declines in energy and
fruit and vegetable prices were not enough to offset widespread
increases elsewhere.
   The March figures are ``a reminder that inflation is a chronic
problem, that it's not going away and it's not getting better,''
said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill.
   While inflation is still expected to slow in coming months, the
March figure sent some economists scurrying to revise upward their
forecast for the entire year. Some said consumer prices could rise
by 5 percent for all of 1990. That would be up from a 4.6 percent
increase in 1989 and the highest annual rate since 1981.
   The bad news on inflation had a negative impact on financial
markets, pushing the yields on bond prices up as investors demanded
more insurance against inflation threats. Stock prices retreated
but recovered somewhat later in the day.
   In another economic report Tuesday, the government said
industrial production rose 0.7 percent in March, reflecting a
rebound in auto production. It was the second consecutive strong
showing and provided evidence, some analysts said, that the slump
in American manufacturing may finally be coming to an end.
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said that housing
construction fell for the second consecutive month, declining by
9.3 percent as new homes and apartments were being built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million units in March.
   Analysts predicted the 0.5 percent inflation rate in March _
which followed an equal gain of 0.5 percent in February and a 1.1
percent increase in January _ would strengthen the Federal
Reserve's resolve not to lower interest rates, despite pressures
from the Bush administration.
   In fact, Sinai said that if inflation does not slow soon, the
Federal Reserve might even begin pushing interest rates upward,
something it has not done for over a year, in an effort to dampen
price pressures.
   ``The message is that it may take more pain, more restraint on
the economy, to get inflation down to acceptable levels,'' he said.
   Over two-thirds of the March inflation came from rising housing
and clothing prices.
   Housing costs rose by 0.5 percent, the biggest advance since
January's 0.7 percent.
   Clothing costs, which climbed a record 3.3 percent in February,
rose 1.6 percent last month as the impact of sharply higher costs
for new spring lines continued to be felt.
   So far this year, clothing prices are up at an annual rate of
21.4 percent, compared to an increase of just 1 percent for all of
1989.
   Medical costs jumped 0.8 percent last month and have risen 8.6
percent over the past year, the biggest increase of all the major
categories.
   Energy prices were down during the month, dropping by 0.8
percent, pushed lower by a 1.4 percent drop in gasoline pump prices
and another big drop in home heating oil costs which continued to
retreat after a big spike in January.
   Food prices rose 0.4 percent during the month, slightly less
than the 0.5 percent increase in February, as a big drop in fruit
and vegetable prices offset increases in other areas.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy areas were up
sharply as well in March, climbing 0.7 percent, the fastest since a
0.8 percent rise in December. Economists believe this core rate is
a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures.
   The various changes left the Consumer Price Index at 128.7
before seasonal adjustments. That meant that a hypothetical
selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base
period would have cost $128.70 last month, up from $122.50 a year
ago.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, the right-hand
man to Martin Luther King Jr. who was spurned by colleagues after
publicly telling of King's infidelity, died today after a
three-week hospitalization. He was 64.
   Abernathy, who complained in his book that aides viewed him only
as a glorified pal and bodyguard to King, ``was the unsung hero of
the modern civil rights movement,'' said a friend and political
ally, state Rep. Tyrone Brooks. ``He never received the recognition
he's due.''
   Abernathy died at Crawford Long Hospital, which he entered three
weeks ago for an electrolytic imbalance. Hospital officials said
his heart stopped during a lung scan, and he died while in an
operating room. They would not say what surgery Abernathy might
have been undergoing.
   Abernathy was president emeritus of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and pastor of Atlanta's West Hunter Street
Baptist Church.
   He caused a controversy last year when he wrote in his
autobiography that King dallied with two women and later fought
with a third he had spurned on the night and morning before his
1968 assassination.
   King's family and many of his colleagues condemned Abernathy
following the book's publication. But Tuesday, King's son, a
visibly saddened Fulton County Commissioner Martin Luther King III,
called Abernathy's death ``certainly a very tragic loss to our
nation.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who succeeded Abernathy as president of
the SCLC, today called Abernathy ``a faithful servant of the cause
of liberty and justice.''
   Lowery said he regretted the allegations against King in
Abernathy's book, ``nevertheless his record still stands as a
stalwart steward in this movement.''
   Abernathy, born March 11, 1926, in Linden, Ala., worked in the
civil rights movement from its inception in 1955. He stood at
King's side through the great battles of the movement and went to
jail as often as King did, but Abernathy consistently found himself
in King's shadow.
   In his autobiography, ``And the Walls Came Tumbling Down,''
Abernathy said he felt other King aides saw him as ``no more than
an appendage to Martin, someone who served as a part companion,
part bodyguard, but who never played an important role in the
decisions that affected the direction of the movement.''
   Abernathy mentioned in his autobiography that King dallied with
various women on April 3, 1968, his last night alive. He became the
first of the civil rights inner circle to openly discuss King's
alleged marital infidelities, which had been chronicled by several
noted biographers.
   That revelation drew the ire of black leaders who asked
Abernathy to retract the passages dealing with King's alleged
infidelity and insinuated that Abernathy's memory had been impaired
by two strokes and brain surgery.
   The book controversy tore a hole in the already fragile
relationship Abernathy had with his movement colleagues, a
relationship that had been rather cool since Abernathy's 1980
endorsement of Ronald Reagan for president. Abernathy supported
Jesse Jackson, another former King aide, for president in 1988.
   Abernathy and King led the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in
1955, which launched the civil rights movement. In 1957, the pair
founded the SCLC, and Abernathy was King's confidant, counselor and
cellmate during the turbulent years before King was shot to death
in Memphis, Tenn.
   It was Abernathy who cradled King's bloody head April 4, 1968,
as he lay dying of a bullet wound on the balcony of the Lorraine
Motel. He took care of various funeral details for King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, and delivered the eulogy at his best friend's
funeral.
   Abernathy said he had no desire to lead the civil rights
movement, preferring to leave that role to the more charismatic
King. But two days after King's death, Abernathy was SCLC
president, leading the Poor People's Campaign, a mass demonstration
held in Washington in the summer of 1968.
   Abernathy was SCLC president for nine years, as the focus of the
civil rights movement shifted from voting rights and civil rights
to such economic issues as full employment and anti-poverty
programs.
   He resigned from the SCLC in 1977, saying he wanted to devote
his time to a campaign for Congress. He was defeated in the
Democratic primary.
   Concentrating on preaching and lecturing, Abernathy also held
the title of president with honors of the World Peace Conference
headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, and he traveled around the
world three times on peace missions.
   He suffered a stroke in 1983, and underwent brain bypass surgery
at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. After he recovered, he
returned to preach at West Hunter Street Baptist Church, where he
had been pastor since 1961.
   At a 1985 dinner, he was praised by other civil rights leaders
as an ``unsung hero'' of their movement. In 1989, he was handed a
telegram, signed by most of his movement contemporaries, which said
the accounts about King in his autobiography could ``rob you of
your rightful place in history.''
   Despite the controversy, Abernathy stood by his account as true.
   ``I'm not Judas,'' he said. ``I know who I am.''
   Abernathy is survived by his wife, Juanita; two sons, Kwame and
state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy III; and two daughters, Juandalynn
and Donzaleigh.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will make
Indianapolis 500 history when he serves as grand marshal for the
race parade May 26.
   Quayle, an Indiana native, will be the first sitting vice
president to lead the 104-unit parade.
   ``Parades are not what a president or vice president would
normally do, something they aren't always invited to,'' said Ray
Yonkus, special agent in charge of the Secret Service in
Indianapolis. He said Monday he assumed Quayle's last parade was at
the 1989 inauguration.
   ``There's only so much you can do with a parade crowd because it
is open to the public, so it gives you extra headaches,'' Yonkus
said. He declined to say how many officers would be needed to
protect Quayle.
   The vice president, his wife, Marilyn, and their children,
Tucker, Benjamin, and Corinne, are expected to spend three days in
the city.
   The Quayles also attended last year's Indianapolis 500.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, whose personal and political
life was rocked last year by disclosure of his relationship with a
male prostitute, announced Tuesday he will seek re-election.
   The Democrat had intended to wait until the House ethics
committee released a report about questions surrounding his
involvement with prostitute Stephen Gobie, but said the election
calendar pushed him to act sooner.
   Frank must file nominating petitions by May 8.
   ``People may decide to run or not run based on what I do. So I
thought it was only fair to let people know that,'' Frank said.
   Frank, 50, said he also concluded his effectiveness as a
congressmen had not been hurt by the relationship with Gobie that
he said ended in 1986.
   The relationship, which included Frank hiring Gobie as a
personal aide after paying him for sex, was revealed in August by
The Washington Times.
   The story also quoted sources as saying Frank was aware Gobie
ran a prostitution ring from his Washington apartment, an
allegation Frank has vigorously denied.
   ``I did some things that were dumb. I was also accused of some
things that weren't true. I had to figure out whether the
combination of that was going to damage my effectiveness,'' Frank
said. ``Obviously my judgment is that it has not.''
   Frank, who in 1987 became the first member of Congress to
voluntarily disclose being homosexual, said his major concern was
how his congressional colleagues viewed him and his ability to
continue with the job.
   ``My sense is none of them think I deserve a Nobel Prize for
judgment for what I did five years ago, but I think they have given
me a chance to establish what did and didn't happen,'' Frank said.
``Based on that, I don't think my ability to fight for the things I
care about has been damaged.''
   Alexander Tennant, executive director of the Massachusetts
Republican Party, accused Frank of breaking his word by announcing
for re-election before the ethics committee reported.
   ``He is just disregarding a commitment he made to the public,''
Tennant said. ``It was all a charade. He had every intention of
running from day one.''
   Tennant accused Frank of abuse of power because Frank has
acknowledged writing to Virginia parole authorities on behalf of
Gobie.
   No other Democrats have announced for the seat, the Fourth
Congressional District in suburban Boston. Two little-known
Republicans, Jim Nuzzo, a physician, and John Soto, a telephone
company accountant, have announced their candidacies.

<HEAD>Members of Afghanistan's Ruling Party Executed For Coup Role</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senior members of Afghanistan's
ruling party have been executed for their alleged role in last
month's bloody coup attempt, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   Ghulam Astagir Panjshiri and Saleh Mohammad Zeary were expelled
from the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and the powerful
Politburo shortly after the failed March 6 coup, the diplomats said
on condition of anonymity.
   The diplomats said information from the Afghan capital of Kabul
indicated the men were put to death but the date was not
immediately clear. The executions could not be independently
confirmed.
   Shaw Nawaz Tanai, Afghanistan's former defense minister and
architect of the attempted coup, has been hiding at a guerrilla
base inside Afghanistan, according to guerrilla sources and
diplomats.
   Tanai, once a fierce opponent of the U.S.-backed guerrillas,
defected after troops loyal to President Najib crushed the
mutineers. He joined the most radical of the seven guerrilla groups
based in Pakistan, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami.
   The Afghan government has arrested 600 people in connection with
the failed coup, diplomats said.
   The latest arrests included the chiefs of police in Jalalabad
and Khost, both in eastern Afghanistan, the chairman of Kabul
University and chairman of the Afghan Academy of Sciences, the
diplomats said.
   The diplomats also said Najib had appointed a new ambassador to
the Soviet Union, Mohammad Daod Rasmyar, fanning speculation about
the disappearance of former ambassador Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoi, a
long-time enemy of Najib's.
   Diplomats and guerrilla leaders had expected Tanai's coup
attempt would trigger mass defections within the Afghan army,
particularly among the Khalqs. Najib belongs to the rival Parchams.
   ``There just haven't been the defections,'' said one diplomat.
   Meanwhile, diplomats said Afghan soldiers pushed through several
guerrilla positions in Afghanistan's eastern Logar Province,
recapturing several posts and establishing new ones.
   The guerrillas, fighting the Soviet-backed government for 12
years, are bankrolled by the United States and Saudi Arabia, but
regularly complain of weapons' shortages. One Western diplomat said
there appeared to be a genuine shortage of ammunition in Logar
because of heavy fighting.
   Washington annually ships about $700 million worth of military
supplies to the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. Moscow has
been sending between $3 billion and $5 billion in weapons and food
to the Kabul government since withdrawing its troops early last
year after a decade-long occupation, Western diplomats said.

   A bomb exploded in a western state
Tuesday and killed one woman, and authorities found eight bombs on
a railroad track in northern India, news reports said. Officials
said security was stepped up nationwide.
   The incidents came a day after fire heavily damaged the
government's main convention center in New Delhi. Sikh separatists
claimed reponsibility for the blaze.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said Tuesday's bomb blast
occurred at Palghar, six miles from the Tarapur nuclear power
plant, in western Maharastra state. One woman was killed. Another
bomb-like object was found nearby. Both bombs were concealed in tin
cases the size of a loaf of bread.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.
   The 420-megawatt Tarapur plant is 70 miles north of Bombay on
the Indian Ocean.
   Safety workers found and dismantled eight bombs on a train track
near the Hindu holy city of Mathura, 90 miles of southeast of New
Delhi, Press Trust of India reported.
   PTI, quoting a senior police official, said the bombs were
planted on the railroad track to blow up the Marudhar Express
train, which carries an estimated 1,600 passengers. The train
carries many Hindu pilgrims to Mathura.
   Federal officials in the Interior Ministry, which overlooks
internal security, said security was increased around all important
government buildings and installations, including nuclear power
plants. They did not elaborate.
   The fire in the government's main conference center in New Delhi
was extinguished Tuesday, nearly 17 hours after it was first
noticed, fire department sources said. Two firefighters were
reported injured.
   The five-story building in the heart of New Delhi, venue of the
summit meeting of non-aligned nations in 1983 and several other
important international conferences, was badly damaged.
   United News of India said a Sikh militant group, Khalistan
Liberation Force, claimed responsibility for the fire.
   Sikh militants in Punjab are campaigning for an independent Sikh
nation. At least 607 deaths in the rich farming state this year
have been blamed on the militants.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but they
are in slight majority in their home state of Punjab. They claim
they are discriminated by Hindus, the country's religious majority
accounting for 82 percent of the people.

   A New York-based securities firm agreed to pay
$5.6 million to customers for stock sold in partial tender offers
without prior client approval, federal officials said Tuesday.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. and a managing
director, Michael Dreitlein, agreed to settle _ without admitting
or denying wrongdoing _ an administrative action alleging they
violated Securities and Exchange Commission anti-fraud and
record-keeping rules.
   The action, brought by the SEC's New York Regional Office, the
firm's Pershing Division of making $4.3 million in tender offer
profits from the ``unauthorized and undisclosed'' sale of shares
from customer accounts.
   A tender offer is an offer to buy a corporation's shares _ often
as a means of acquiring the concern _ usually at a premium price.
   According to the SEC, the division, then directed by Dreitlein,
tendered shares belonging to customers who had not given any
instructions to do so. The shares were later replaced, usually with
stock bought at a lower price after the tender offer. DLJ kept any
profits from the difference between the sale and repurchase price.
   The alleged activity, known as overtendering, took place between
January 1982 and April 1988, according to the SEC.
   ``Securities transactions are predicated on trust. DLJ misused
that trust when it confiscated customers' securities for its
benefit,'' said Martin A. Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regional
administrator in New York.
   As part of the settlement with the SEC, DLJ agreed to pay $4.3
million plus interest for a total of $5.6 million to customers
whose shares were used in the overtendering.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must set up
training requirements for nuclear power plant workers, a federal
appeals court said Tuesday.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the NRC had circumvented
a 1983 change in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The NRC issued a
policy statement in 1985 that encourages, but does not compel,
nuclear plant operators to create training programs.
   The NRC concluded that the best way to get civilian nuclear
power plants to improve training was to create a model training
code and urge utilities to voluntarily comply.
   The NRC ended up endorsing industry-written training procedures.
And utility companies with nuclear power plants are successfully
meeting those standards, said Angie Howard of the Institute of
Nuclear Power Operations, an industry group.
   Public Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader, filed lawsuits
in 1986 and 1988 challenging the NRC's approach.
   The NRC looked again at the training issue in 1988 and decided
not to impose requirements, relying on language in the amendment
that allows the agency to issue ``appropriate ... regulatory
guidance.''
   The term ``regulatory guidance'' is ambiguous, but the language
mandating the instructional requirements is clear and controls the
issue, Chief Judge Patricia Wald wrote.
   ``Whatever the commission's regulatory guidance is, it must
establish instructional requirements, and non-mandatory suggestions
fail to do this,'' she wrote in the 3-0 decision. ``When Congress
gives an agency its marching orders, the agency must obey all of
them, not merely some.''
   Wald noted that a presidential panel examining the accident at
Three Mile Island said inadequate training contributed
significantly to the risks posed by nuclear power plants.
   The NRC and utilities argued that imposing mandatory
requirements would make the nuclear power industry less safe
because it would choke off the industry's self-regulatory efforts.
Companies could regard the NRC's requirements as a maximum rather
than a minimum level of appropriate training, the agency said.
   The NRC and the industry ``must take this argument to the
Congress, not to the courts,'' said the appeals panel.
   Voluntary industry training was under way when Congress passed
the law and the NRC's model training code ``is exactly what
Congress did not want to perpetuate,'' said David Vladeck, an
attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation Group.
   In the NRC's inspections of specific sites, ``we have had
concerns about the effectiveness of training,'' said Susan Shankman
of the federal agency's office of nuclear reactor regulation.
Monitoring is continuing.
   The training programs in place now ``are superb'' and the court
ruling probably won't have an impact on them, said Joe Colvin,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council, a utility industry group.
   ``I can't argue that there won't be any increased enforcement''
action by the NRC as a result of the court case, but ``we don't
view that as a major'' problem, said Colvin.

   Benjamin Franklin died 200 years ago Tuesday, and
according to his will that means it's now time to spend the 1,000
pounds sterling he bequeathed to Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.
   The pennies saved are now worth about $4.5 million, and requests
for a cut are pouring in from as far away as London.
   Franklin died in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. In
his will, he gave 1,000 pounds sterling to Massachusetts and the
city of Boston, and an equal sum to the state of Pennsylvania and
the city of Philadelphia. The dollar did not become the official
U.S. currency until 1792.
   The money came from what Franklin earned during his tenure as
president of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 1785-87. He believed
that politicians should not be paid for serving the public.
   Franklin specified in his will that on the 100th anniversary of
his death a part of the two trusts be used for training young
people, but at that time several interested parties sued for access
to the money.
   A Massachusetts court resolved the dispute there by setting up a
board of managers to control the money until the 200th anniversary.
   The managers ultimately decided to build a technical school, the
Franklin Institute in Boston.
   A similar arrangement in Pennsylvania benefited the Franklin
Institute in Philadelphia, a science museum.
   The Massachusetts group did considerably better in investing its
share, with the fund now worth about $4.5 million. Pennsylvania's
1,000 pounds is now worth $2 million.
   Because Franklin's trust was not set up for more than a year
after he died, current litigation seeks to put a date on when the
money will be released to the cities and states. Officials
estimated it would be 1991 before the recipients see their share.
   Then comes the question of what to do with the money.
   ``In keeping with Franklin's legacy we'd like to use the fund to
help the young people of Boston with job training for their
careers. This way, we're investing in the future of Boston,'' said
Bob Consalvo, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn's operations manager.
   Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode issued a statement citing
Franklin's hope that the money aid students. He said the money
should go to city high school students or recent graduates who need
financial aid, especially in pursuit of a trade.
   Susan Kaplan, a spokeswoman for Gov. Michael Dukakis, said
Massachusetts' plan for the trust had not been determined.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey's office also said there were
no firm plans for that state's share.
   Consalvo said requests for money from the fund have come from as
far away as London, where a group called Friends of the Franklin
House want $1.5 million to renovate the early American's home there.
   Another bid for the funds has come from Boston's Franklin
Institute, which gives financial aid and technical training to
Boston youth.
   ``We feel Franklin's memory would be better served if the trust
would be used for the Institute,'' said Richard P. D'Onofrio, vice
president of the institute. ``That's our cry _ continue the
legacy.''
   In Pennsylvania, Rod Snyder, a spokesman for the governor's
budget office, said Philadelphia's Franklin Institute would be the
likely recipient of the money, although some legislators there have
suggested it be used to promote the arts.
   It also has been suggested that Boston use the funds to combat
the rising crime rates among young people.
   ``It will fit in nicely with the city's Safe Neighborhoods Plan.
We believe that through good jobs and careers you can replace the
drugs and violence that influence our youth,'' Consalvo said.

<HEAD>Winning Design For Free Speech Monument: Free Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mostly invisible sculpture that its
creator says suggests the idea of ``free space'' has been chosen to
commemorate the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s.
   The winning design, picked in a nationwide contest, consists of
a 6-inch circular patch of earth that sits within a 6-foot granite
ring. The viewer is asked to visualize concentric columns of air
rising from the circles.
   Along the low granite ring, which will be several inches wide,
an inscription will read: ``This soil and the air space extending
above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject
to any entity's jurisdiction.''
   The winning artist, Mark A. Brest van Kempen, was announced
Monday by Peter Selz, professor emeritus of art history at the
University of California at Berkeley and chairman of the Berkeley
Art Project, a group of about 100 faculty members that sponsored
the search.
   The Free Speech Movement was born on the UC-Berkeley campus in
1964.
   Brest van Kempen, a 28-year-old graduate student at the San
Francisco Art Institute, described his mostly invisible design as
``apolitical'' and said his idea was to dedicate the ``free space''
to the right of all humans to speak freely.
   He plans to devote more than half the $70,000 prize money toward
getting special legislation to declare the space free of national
boundaries.
   Brest van Kempen's work is to be displayed on the campus' Sproul
Plaza, pending approval from the university _ which remains
uncertain.
   In a letter in January, UC-Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael
Heyman expressed misgivings about honoring the Free Speech
Movement, saying it had been viewed by many in the community ``with
negative or mixed emotions.''
   The movement challenged the university's rules against political
activity on campus. The demonstrations sparked a wave of protests
that made armed camps of the nation's colleges before the 1960s
were over.
   Veterans of the movement, along with UC-Berkeley faculty and
students and representatives of the city, chose the winner from
among five finalists.

   The nation's industrial production gained 0.7
percent in March, the government said Tuesday, in a second
consecutive strong showing that led analysts to suggest the
manufacturing ``recession'' may have ended.
   ``We may have been through the worst of the slowdown,'' said
Thomas Runiewicz, an industrial analyst with the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``I think you'll hear less talk of recession from the
pessimists for a while.''
   March's advance followed an even stronger 0.8 percent increase a
month earlier. Both gains reflected increases in the output of
automobiles, the Federal Reserve reported.
   ``The other major contributor to the overall production increase
in March was utility output, which increased markedly as
temperatures were more normal after an unseasonably warm January
and February,'' the Fed said. ``Elsewhere, production was little
changed, on balance, in March.''
   Production had plummeted 1.3 percent in January because of the
effect of the weather on utility output and of layoffs in the
automobile industry as automakers trimmed bloated inventories.
   ``The suggestion is that the bottom has been reached in the
industrial sector weakness and the issue raised is whether, in
light of such high inflation, the industrial sector now may be too
strong,'' remarked Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co.
   In another report Tuesday, the Labor Department said consumer
prices jumped 0.5 percent in March, pushing the inflation rate for
the first three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight
years.
   Evelina Tainer, senior economist for First National Bank of
Chicago, also said she believes the slowdown in manufacturing
reached bottom in the fourth quarter of 1989, but added the
industrial sector still is ``not showing particular strength.''
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods rose 0.3 percent in March on top of a
1.1 percent gain a month earlier.
   Durable manufacturing was up 0.9 percent after jumping 1.7
percent in February. Non-durable manufacturing was down 0.4 percent
in March after inching up 0.2 percent a month earlier.
   Output at mines rose 0.6 percent last month after dropping 1.6
percent in February. Reflecting the return to relatively normal
weather, utility output jumped 6.1 percent in March after falling
1.2 percent in February.
   The Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines
and utilities _ which usually move in tandem with industrial
production _ advanced 0.4 percentage point to 83.3 percent last
month. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes
in productivity levels.

<HEAD>United States Criticizes Malaysia Over Boat People</HEAD>

   The United States criticized Malaysia on
Tuesday for turning away Vietnamese boat people, saying the policy
was responsible for the death of four people.
   The United States ``has vigorously protested the denial of first
asylum to Vietnamese at all appropriate levels of the Malaysian
government,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Malaysia and other South Asian countries agreed last summer to
grant asylum to Vietnamese fleeing their homeland. Under the
agreement, those arriving before March 14, 1989, would be screened
to determine which were entitled to refugee status and which were
economic migrants.
   Malaysia denies it has turned away Vietnamese but says it is
worried about being stuck with migrants who are not accepted by the
United States and other western countries as refugees.
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has reported
that at least 4,000 asylum seekers from Vietnam arrived in
Indonesia after being ``redirected'' by Malaysian authorities,
Tutwiler said.
   ``We are deeply distressed that four Vietnamese have perished as
a result of Malaysian actions,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Discovery's launch next week with
the Hubble Space Telescope may be moved up a day if a new power
unit tests well and the change doesn't hamper preparations for the
next shuttle mission, NASA said Tuesday.
   The second attempt to launch Discovery is scheduled for April
25, 15 days after the first attempt was scrubbed because of a
faulty auxiliary power unit.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the delay
has pushed back the launch of space shuttle Columbia to at least
mid-May. Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off May 9 on a
nine-day mission to scan space with a $100 million observatory
called Astro.
   NASA said it will wait until after Discovery is launched with
the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, the agency's most valuable
payload, before setting a new target date for Columbia.
   ``We're required to inspect the hardware of the previous mission
before we fly the next one,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   For now, she said, ``Things are going well. We're not tracking
any serious problems on either of them.''
   Hubble will not be at risk inside Discovery's sealed payload bay
when the new power unit is fired up for five minutes Wednesday,
said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   The unit is one of three that pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic
system, which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the
ship's braking and steering systems. Each APU must work properly
before a shuttle can be launched.
   Contamination sensors removed from the cargo bay over the
weekend showed no evidence of additional dust or debris on the
telescope's 94-inch mirror, the finest ever made, Diller said.
   ``It's as clean as a whistle,'' he said.
   Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries are undergoing 130 hours
of recharging at a laboratory in the Vehicle Assembly Building.
They will be put back in the telescope Saturday.
   The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected
from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar
panels are deployed 380 miles above Earth. Once in orbit, the
telescope will enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion
years.
   Because of preparations for Discovery are going so smoothly,
NASA is considering advancing the mission to Tuesday, said NASA
spokesman Ed Campion.
   ``Test of the APU is the long pole in the tent,'' Campion said.
``If that goes well, they'll poll each of the (launch) team members
and ask how their work is going, their ability to support an
advance in the launch date. If they all say they can, then we
probably would move up the date.''
   The decision, expected Wednesday, also will depend on whether a
change interferes with work preparing Columbia's payload for
launch, Diller said. The agency plans to roll Columbia out Sunday
to the second of the Kennedy Space Center's two shuttle launch pads.
   Columbia was transferred from the orbiter processing facility to
the Vehicle Assembly Building on Monday. The move was delayed three
days so technicians could replace a leaking hydraulic part in the
shuttle's nose landing gear.

<HEAD>French Quarter Residents Suing to Turn Down Jazz Bands' Volume</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tourists love the brass bands that blare out
Dixieland music all day long in the French Quarter's Jackson
Square, but merchants and residents in the heart of the jazz
citadel are suing to turn down the volume.
   Their lawsuit, filed Monday, says the music is causing
``headaches, stress, buzzing in the eardrums, loss of sleep,
nervousness, irritability, mental and emotional turmoil.''
   ``It would be like somebody putting two or three big, huge brass
bands below your window where you live or where you work all day
every day,'' lawyer and shop owner Luke Fontana said Tuesday.
   Jackson Square is considered by many the heart of the French
Quarter _ the oldest section of the city. The Mississippi River
runs along one boundary of the square. The other boundaries are
formed by St. Louis Cathedral and other historic buildings housing
museums, shops, bars and apartments.
   Stone sidewalks and a black iron fence form a perimeter around a
small, grassy, tree-shaded park, at the center of which is a statue
of Andrew Jackson on horseback.
   Tourists flock to the square in good weather. Many have their
portraits painted or caricatures done by street artists who set up
shop on the sidewalks. Others gather around the brass bands and
throw money into the musicians' hats or empty instrument cases.
   Music has been part of the scene for years, but Brad Thoren, one
of the artists involved in the lawsuit, said that in the past
couple of years too many musicians have been playing too loudly,
too often. He's concerned that the excessive noise could damage the
hearing of those exposed to it every day.
   ``You have to shout to your customer to be heard. That is a
hazard. That's a proven fact,'' he said.
   Noise ordinances that could solve the problem already are on the
books, Fontana said. The lawsuit would make the police do more to
enforce them.
   New Orleans Civil Court Judge Richard Ganucheau set a hearing on
the lawsuit for April 27.
   ``Every musician that's on the street is going to be there,''
said Anthony ``Tuba Fats'' Lacen, leader of the six-piece Chosen
Few Jazz Band that regularly plays the square.
   Lacen said New Orleans, still suffering from an economic
slowdown that hit in the early 1980s, needs all the tourist dollars
it can get, and restricting the musicians could drive away tourists.
   ``If they're not interested in keeping our city alive, then what
are they doing here?'' Lacen asked.
   Thoren said the problem isn't so much professionals like Lacen.
It's youngsters who don't play very well to begin with, playing in
makeshift bands on weekends and afternoons after school.
   With the growing number of musicians, there is growing
competition for tourist attention and money, said Lee Tucker, an
artist and French Quarter resident.
   ``The street performers themselves have been competing against
each other and the way they eliminate the competition is to play
louder,'' said Tucker.
   Fontana is sensitive to the argument that tourists like the
Dixieland bands. But there is more than tourism at stake, he said.
   Blaring brass bands lend nothing to the centuries-old
architecture and charm of the quarter, he said. And reducing the
number of musicians won't chase tourists away, he added.
   ``The quality of life is the intrinsic economic core of the
community,'' said Fontana. ``And that is where the money is in the
long run.''
   Caught in the middle is Capt. George Bourgeois, commander of the
Police Department's Vieux Carre division.
   Bourgeois said he has too few men trained in the use of sound
measuring equipment to enforce the loudness provision of the noise
ordinance.
   And the department's legal counsel has advised against
enforcement of a law forbidding the playing of an instrument that
is clearly audible more than 50 feet away.

   Johnny Carson's first wife said Tuesday she is
living in a small hotel with no job and wants a judge to force the
television host to increase her annual alimony from $13,500 to
$120,000.
   Joan ``Jody'' Carson, 63, said she hasn't spoken to the father
of her three sons in ``many, many, many years'' and recent attempts
to reach him have been unsuccessful.
   ``He's quite unavailable,'' she said in a telephone interview
from the office of her attorney, matrimonial lawyer Raoul Felder.
``He won't really talk to me at all.''
   Carson married his high-school sweetheart in 1949. A postnuptial
agreement called for Mrs. Carson to receive $15,000 a year plus 15
percent of Carson's earnings over $100,000, Felder said. They
divorced in 1963.
   When Mrs. Carson remarried in 1970, she signed a new agreement
giving her $13,500 annually as well as certain bonuses that ended
in 1979.
   That marriage ended in 1973.
   Mrs. Carson, who was Carson's assistant in his magic act at the
University of Nebraska, said she is living off her savings in a
small midtown Manhattan residential hotel.
   ``I'm like many women of my age with no way of earning a
living,'' she said. ``I don't want to get rich. ... I am simply
forced into this situation.''
   Mrs. Carson said she is not close with her three sons, ages 41,
39 and 38. She said they each receive $50,000 a year from Carson.
   Felder said a private detective served ``The Tonight Show'' host
with court papers Friday in Los Angeles. He is to respond by May 1
in a state court in Manhattan.
   ``It's really a relatively modest figure,'' Felder said of the
$120,000 request. ``This is not an Ivana Trump case.''
   Carson, 64, reportedly earns $40 million a year.
   According to the syndicated television program, ``A Current
Affair,'' which reported on the lawsuit Monday, Carson pays his
second wife, Joanne, $75,000 a year.
   His third wife, Joanna, won a $27 million lump-sum settlement.
He is currently wed to Alex Maas.
   Carson's attorney did not return a phone call Tuesday afternoon.

   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said Tuesday
that he will introduce a bill this week with the most comprehensive
wetlands policy yet sent to Congress.
   He said the bill follows President Bush's policy of no overall
net loss in wetlands and would restore and create such areas.
   It is supported by the National Wildlife Federation and former
New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who chaired a national committee that
evaluated wetland policies and made recommendations to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Bennett said the bill makes improvements on the agreement
reached last year between the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA
over wetlands. That agreement originally was applauded by
environmentalists but met with such opposition from developers that
it was modified.
   Bennett said that even though he calls his bill the Wetlands No
Net Loss Act of 1990, it doesn't call for discontinuation of
development.
   ``However, it does mean that every attempt should be made to
direct growth away from wetlands where possible, and to minimize
the effects on wetlands where avoidance is not possible,'' he said.
   He said the legislation provides clear definitions of wetlands
and would settle conflicts between state and federal jurisdictions.

   The State Department said Tuesday that some
Russian writers on an officially sponsored tour of the United
States hold anti-Semitic views.
   Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler called their views abhorrent
and said one purpose of the tour, funded by the U.S. Information
Agency, was to educate the writers about ``how the United States
works as a multiethnic society based on individual freedoms.''
   The U.S. official, reading from a prepared statement, added,
``Bringing them here does not signal that we approve or sanction
their views.''
   The tour prompted a complaint from the American Jewish Committee.
   ``It's naive to believe such people can be converted
overnight,'' said David Harris, director of its Washington office.
   ``We are giving the group undue exposure by bringing them to the
United States at American taxpayer expense,'' he said. ``And I am
concerned we are dignifying and legitimizing this group, which can
only strengthen their hand when they return to the USSR.''
   Harris, in an interview, called the group both anti-Semitic and
anti-reformist. ``Someone here did not do their homework,'' he said.
   A Russian Jewish emigre whose studies of anti-Semitic writers
were used by the committee, Semyon Reznick, said some writers in
the group ``exuded the myth of a Jewish-Zionist conspiracy, an old
Russian hatred'' in their work.
   Frank S. Johnson Jr., a spokesman for the U.S. Information
Agency, said, ``I don't know that they are anti-Semitic; I don't
know that they are not, either. ... We feel very strongly that
pluralism in this country is worth talking about and observing.''
   But Ms. Tutwiler, asked if some of the Russians might have
anti-Semitic views, replied: ``My understanding is that some of the
people do hold those views. But our opinion, as you know, is that
we bring all types of groups here, and it is not a sanction or
endorsement of those views, at all.''
   She said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had raised the
issue of growing anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union with Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in their last two rounds of
meetings.
   Ms. Tutwiler said perestroika, the reconstruction policy of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, should bring more tolerance,
not intolerance.
   Emigre Reznick singled out Stanislav Kunyaev as a ``big fish''
of anti-Semitic writers in the group.
   As editor of Nash Sovremenik (Our Contemporary), Kunyaev wrote
an article praising the long-discredited ``Protocols of the Elders
of Zion'' as ``written by very clever people who understand the
history of mankind.''
   The protocols purport to be an account of a meeting of Jewish
leaders plotting to control the world. Adolf Hitler in Germany and
Czarist rulers in Russia used the fictitious documents to stir up
anti-Jewish sentiments to murderous levels.
   Another writer in the Russian group, Olveg Mikhaylov, has
written of the late 18th century Russian writer Gavril Gerzhavin as
a ``victim of a Jewish plot,'' Reznik said.
   Johnson of the USIA said the writers were selected by public
affairs and cultural affairs officers of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
who were seeking to bring conservative Russian nationalists to the
United States.
   State's Tutwiler said: ``The purpose of these programs is to
bring people to the United States so they can see how our society
works. The goal of these programs is an educational goal, teaching
people about the United States. We bring people with a wide range
of opinions to the United States, including some with whom we
thoroughly disagree and whose views we find abhorrent.''

   A flamboyant Saudi Arabian who promised to
donate $1 million for animal rights shelters in Minnesota was being
sought Tuesday by federal officials who say he entered the country
on a bogus visa.
   ``We're still looking for him,'' Thomas Schiltgen, acting
district director at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service in St. Paul, said of Mohammad al-Fassi.
   Schiltgen declined further comment for fear of jeopardizing the
investigation.
   Mark Cangemi, assistant district director of investigations at
the INS office, said al-Fassi, the son of a sheik, arrived in Miami
in September 1989 claiming to represent the Saudi government on
official business.
   ``And that's not correct. He doesn't, he hasn't and he won't,''
Cangemi said.
   An arrest warrant has been issued for al-Fassi who, if caught,
will face deportation proceedings, Cangemi said.
   But it may be too late. Cangemi said al-Fassi has not been seen
in Minnesota since the middle of last week, and authorities say he
may have left the country.
   Following negotiations through his lawyer with the INS, al-Fassi
failed to turn himself in for questioning by April 13 as he had
agreed.
   An al-Fassi aide at the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis, where
al-Fassi had been staying, refused comment Monday.
   Al-Fassi, 33, is the son of Sheik Shamsuddin al-Fassi, a Saudi
Arabian religious leader who underwent a kidney transplant at the
University of Minnesota Hospital last month. His entourage,
including his son, has been in Minneapolis for weeks.
   Last week, aides for the younger al-Fassi gave Minnesota animal
rights activist Lori Peterson a symbolic check for $1 million for
shelters. Peterson, a University of Minnesota law student, had
contacted al-Fassi after hearing that he loved animals.
   But last Wednesday, al-Fassi was charged in Florida's Dade
County with cruelty to animals, according to Joe Torregrosa, an
inspector with the Greater Miami Humane Society.
   The previous day, Torregrosa said, the society had found 32
cats, many sick and dehydrated, at al-Fassi's Miami Beach mansion.
   Peterson said Sunday that an aide to al-Fassi had given her
$1,000 in cash for adoption fees she paid at the Minneapolis Animal
Control pound on Saturday. In a cover story in People magazine in
May 1983, former aides to the al-Fassi family chronicled the
marriage and expensive divorce of the younger al-Fassi and his
lavish lifestyle in Europe, the Middle East, Florida and Los
Angeles.
   When al-Fassi was a teen-ager, his older sister was a mistress
of Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz, brother of future Saudi King Fahd,
the story said. Al-Fassi became the royal prince's accountant.
   The press attache at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington,
D.C., did not return a call regarding al-Fassi. ``He is a private
citizen and we don't give out information on private citizens,''
said the attache's secretary.

<HEAD>Funeral Arrangements Completed for Garbo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Funeral services for actress Greta Garbo were
conducted quickly and quietly Tuesday at a funeral home, completed
with the same mystery that shrouded her life and her death.
   Garbo's body was taken to the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home in
Manhattan. All the arrangements were handled there on Tuesday, a
funeral director confirmed.
   But the funeral parlor _ like the hospital where she died Sunday
_ refused to provide any additional information at the request of
her family. Garbo spent much of the last 49 years of her life in
seclusion, shunning the spotlight for a solitary life.
   The medical examiner's office told the New York Post that
Garbo's body would be cremated, but the funeral home would not
confirm that.
   Her remains may be buried in a family grave in Stockholm, the
Swedish newspaper Expressen reported Tuesday. The newspaper quoted
Garbo's only surviving relative, niece Grae Reisfeld, as saying it
was her aunt's wish to be buried in Sweden.
   Expressen quoted Ms. Reisfeld, of Passaic, N.J., as saying the
cause of death was cardiac arrest.
   ``The heart could not take any more and there were
complications,'' Ms. Reisfeld was quoted as saying.
   Garbo, 84, died at New York Hospital in Manhattan. Any burial
will be private, her family said.
   New York Hospital spokeswoman Myrna Manners confirmed Garbo had
been a kidney dialysis patient at the hospital, but released no
other medical information at the request of Garbo's family.
   The family also requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be
sent to The Rogosin Institute. Garbo underwent dialysis at the
non-profit institute, which is affiliated with New York Hospital.
   The Daily News on Tuesday reported that Garbo received dialysis
three times a week for the past several months, getting six hours
of treatment every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   The paper also said quoted an unidentified Garbo acquaintance as
saying that the legendary film star had one bottle of vodka and two
bottles of scotch per week delivered to her Manhattan apartment
during the months before her death.
   Garbo starred in 26 films in 17 years before quitting the
Hollywood scene in 1941.
   Garbo who was born in Stockholm, made her screen debut in 1923.
After 12 silent films, she delivered her first on-screen sentence
in the 1930 movie ``Anna Christie'':
   ``Gimme a visky, ginger ale on the side. And don't be stingy,
baby.''
   She became a U.S. citizen in 1951 and spent the rest of her life
in seclusion, moving between France, Switzerland and Manhattan. She
lived in an East 52nd Street high rise where doormen were
constantly shooing fans away.
   Garbo died wealthy, although the Post said it is unclear who
will inherit her estate since she left no will. She owned several
buildings in Beverly Hills, an extensive art collection and her
East Side co-op, the Post said.

   The judge in the fraud trial of Imelda Marcos
threatened supporters of the former Philippine first lady with
contempt on Tuesday for hissing and groaning during the
cross-examination of a government witness.
   Judge John F. Keenan, red-faced and angry, stood up at the bench
and said to the courtroom at large, ``I don't know who started
that, but you make one more noise and you're out of here.''
   Keenan threatened to hold anyone involved in a future outburst
in contempt of court. ``This is not Shea Stadium or Yankee Stadium,
or Madison Square Garden,'' the judge said. ``You don't cheer for
one side or another.''
   The brief, noisy reaction came as Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald
Spence, elicited from the witness, Dr. Angelita Reyes, that she
mistakenly testified that she signed an FBI affidavit in 1988,
instead of the correct date in 1986.
   The Philippine dermatologist was called to testify about
documents she helped take from the Malacanang Palace in Manila on
Feb. 28, 1986, three days after Mrs. Marcos' husband, Ferdinand,
was ousted as president in a popular revolt and they fled to Hawaii.
   Several of those documents were admitted into evidence,
including the purchase contract for a Wall Street office building
and bank records that showed Mrs. Marcos used the pseudonym ``Jane
Ryan'' in an account at the Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich.
   The U.S. government intends to use the documents in its effort
to prove that Mrs. Marcos and her late husband used millions of
dollars embezzled from their homeland's treasury to finance her
lavish lifestyle and the purchase of four New York properties,
including the building at 40 Wall St.
   Reyes returned to the stand after a week's break for the Jewish
and Easter holidays. She had testified April 9 that she went to the
palace with her neighbor Margarita ``Ting Ting'' Cojuangco, the
sister-in-law of the then-new President Corazon Aquino.
   Spence sought Tuesday to show Dr. Reyes' friendship with Mrs.
Aquino, her former schoolmate, motivated her to testify for the
prosecution.
   Reyes said she only wanted to tell the truth, not to help either
side win the case.
   ``It is my duty,'' she said.
   ``To whom, Mrs. Aquino?'' Spence asked.
   ``No, sir,'' she replied.

   A burglary suspect was killed when he broke into a
warehouse and tripped a booby-trapped shotgun, police said.
Authorities said three youths with the teen-ager said they were
looking for adventure.
   Michael McComb, 19, was shot in the chest at the warehouse
Saturday night while leading three juveniles in what police called
a burglary attempt. Police said a shotgun was propped up inside the
warehouse and attached to a trip wire.
   The downtown warehouse, leased to Philip Connaghan of suburban
Arvada, had been burglarized eight times since 1987, with shop
tools targeted each time. The handyman lost more than $7,000 in
tools in a burglary last July. The warehouse also housed vehicle
parts, acetylene torches and camper shells.
   Connaghan, who was out of town and spoke once to authorities by
telephone, has denied any knowledge of the booby trap, according to
police.
   Connaghan could not be reached Tuesday. A call to his home was
answered by a person who refused to give a name and said Connaghan
was not home.
   A city ordinance prohibits the setting of booby traps at
businesses, and violators can face misdemeanor charges, said city
assistant district attorney Chuck Lepley. He said the ordinance was
enacted because booby traps can backfire and injure the innocent.
   In cases where someone dies, whoever set the booby trap can be
charged with murder, said Lepley.
   The three youths were arrested Saturday night and were booked
for investigation of burglary and released to their parents.
   ``These kids are talking about going out and exploring. They
call it `exploring and adventuring,''' said police Sgt. Doug
Hildebrant.
   ``It's almost like a game. They were in it for the excitement.''
   City District Attorney Norm Early said Colorado's ``Make My
Day'' law, which allows householders to use deadly force to defend
themselves, probably does not apply. The law was nicknamed after a
line from a Clint Eastwood movie.
   ``You just cannot go around intentionally taking someone's life
to protect property,'' the district attorney said Monday. ``The
property must be a dwelling, and the person who does the shooting
must be present.''
   The Colorado Supreme Court ruled defendants must prove they were
in danger when they used deadly force against intruders.
   Connaghan said previously he had tried almost everything to keep
out burglars, but they just kept breaking in. He parked vehicles in
front of the doors, and burglars towed them out of the way and
broke in. He put up fence topped with three strips of barbed wire
and they still got in.
   Less than three weeks ago, someone hooked a chain to a large bay
door, attached it to a vehicle and ripped the door off its hinges.
   A guard dog Connaghan bought reportedly ran away.
   Kevin Corbin, owner of the Skyline Cafe where Connaghan stopped
for coffee, said he offered Connaghan some advice:
   ``Phil, if it was my restaurant they were hitting, I'd sit here
with a gun and make sure I was never robbed again.''
   Connaghan had his own plan. He welded the second bay door shut
and ran rods through the concrete walls.
   Connaghan said that if someone tried to take down the door this
time, they'd have to take down the entire building, according to
Corbin.
   In Florida in 1986, a Liberty City discount store owner rigged
an electrical booby trap to deter burglars, and the trap
electrocuted a burglary suspect. The Dade County grand jury refused
to indict the store owner, saying he had not meant to kill, only to
shock.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges Speedy Contra Camp Demobilization</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Recasts top 5 grafs to CORRECT that Aronson made comments
about dismantling camps, NOT Bush</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contra rebels are quickly demobilizing,
but it is doubtful they will all lay down their weapons by the time
Daniel Ortega steps down as president of Nicaragua April 25 even
though their camps should be dismantled by then, a top U.S.
official said Tuesday.
   ``Demobilization as agreed to seems to be proceding on
schedule,'' and moving toward dismantling of the Contra camps along
the Honduran border by next week, Assistant Secretary of State
Bernard Aronson told reporters following President Bush's meeting
with visiting Honduran President Rafael Callejas.
   Honduras has pressed for the rebels' speedy repatriation.
   Aronson said it is unlikely all the Contras will surrender their
weapons by the time incoming presideent Violeta Chamorro takes over
from Ortega.
   ``The time frame is moving along faster than people
anticipated'' for demobilizing the rebel forces,'' Aronson said.
``The camps should be dismantled in Honduras before the
inauguration. Those Contras have turned in their weapons or are in
the process of turning in their weapons ... you need to work out a
process whereby arms can be laid down with confidence and a sense
of security.''
   Under peace accords reached by the five presidents of the
region, the Contras are to demobilize into security zones inside
Nicaragua and disarm under U.N. supervision.
   ``Clearly the entire demobilization will not have taken place by
April 25th,'' Aronson said. ``President Ortega knows that,'' he
said in reference to Ortega's demand Monday that complete
disarmament take place so a peaceful transition can occur.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration expects ``a complete orderly transfer of power''
next week. She added, ``The Sandinistas rhetorical statements, such
as those made recently, are unhelpful to the transition process.''
   ``There can be no legitimate reason or international support for
conditioning this transfer.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle will lead the U.S. delegation to Mrs.
Chamorro's inaugural. Among other members of the delegation,
according to an administration source, will be the president's son,
Jeb Bush, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. and Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
   Aronson said that 3,000 to 5,000 Contra fighters remain in the
Honduran camps, down from a peak of 12,000. In addition, the camps
house 40,000 family members and Honduras is home to about 125,000
refugees who have fled Nicaragua, Aronson said.
   Pressed by Honduras for economic and trade assistance, the
United States is preparing a bridge loan to help Honduras with its
$247 million foreign debt, Aronson said following the visit.
   He said that the exact amount of the U.S. loan is not decided
yet and that it will be part of a package that also includes new
international lending, with participation by Japan and other
countries.
   Bush, after his Oval Office meeting with Callejas, lauded the
role Honduras played in the Central American peace process that led
to the Feb. 25 Nicaraguan elections and the end of the decade-long
Contra war.
   ``We support this process and will work to ensure humanitarian
assistance to those in need in both Nicaragua and Honduras as they
return to their homes, their families and their jobs, and play a
vital role in helping Nicaragua establish lasting democratic
institutions,'' Bush said.
   Aronson said the two presidents had discussed concerns involving
Nicaragua, in particular the longstanding desire by Honduras to rid
itself of the border camps housing the U.S.-backed Contras.
   ``He obviously is hopeful the process will move'' toward
repatriation, Aronson said, describing Callejas as optimistic about
the matter.
   Bush's $47 million Contra aid package includes $33 million for
repatriation of the Contras and their families, plus money to go to
the U.N. refugee commission for resettlement of the refugee
families.

   The number of terrorist acts around the
world rose 17 percent to 4,368 last year, and it will only get
worse, the FBI's chief bomb technician said Tuesday at a conference
on airport security.
   ``The numbers just keep going up, and we don't see anything
that's going to negate that trend,'' including multimillion-dollar
bomb detection systems, said Robert Quigley, the head of the
agency's Bomb Data Center.
   The number of incidents last year was up from 3,734 in 1988,
Quigley said. There were 1,930 bombings last year, compared with
1,622 in 1988.
   One of the worst incidents of terrorism was in December 1988,
when a bomb said to be concealed as a radio felled Pan AM Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 people on board, as well as
11 people on the ground, were killed.
   Quigley was among bomb and security experts meeting at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to discuss the status of
airport safety.
   Raymond Salazar, director of civil aviation security for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said the only way to combat
terrorism is through cooperation.
   ``We'll never be 100 percent (effective),'' Salazar said. ``In
preventing criminal acts, your major obstacle is the mind of the
person who is trying to do you harm,'' and that person will always
be a half-step ahead.
   However, terrorists won't win if local governments, law
enforcement and intelligence work together, Salazar said.
   The arsenal against terrorists now includes automated explosive
detection systems developed by the FAA, Salazar said. He estimated
the FAA spent about $60 million over 10 years to develop the
systems, which use thermal-neutron analysis.
   The system is being used at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport and at the Miami International Airport.
Others are planned for Dulles International Airport near
Washington, D.C., and at airports in England and West Germany,
Salazar said.
   About 200 systems will be deployed in 40 airports worldwide
within the next two years, he said.
   Critics say the new systems are ``too large, too slow, like
trying to stuff an elephant into a horse's stall,'' Salazar said.
``To these critics I say, you have to start somewhere. You can't
wait for perfect while you have good available.''
   About 1.2 billion passengers are screened in the United States a
year, or about 2,300 a minute, Salazar said. About 1.25 billion
pieces of carry-on luggage are screened annually, he said.
   ``That means find the hijacker, find the bomb in about four to
six seconds per person per article or less,'' he said. These
constraints are dictated by the passenger, he said. ``It's `Keep me
safe, but please don't make it inconvenient.'''

<TEXT>
   The state House on Tuesday failed to
override Gov. Judd Gregg's veto of an abortion rights bill that the
governor said was too liberal.
   The bill would have given women the right to unrestricted
abortions until the fetus could live outside the womb. Supporters
had argued that the bill essentially put into law what is current
practice.
   The 215-157 vote fell 33 short of the two-thirds needed for
override.
   Chances had been bleak that lawmakers would override the veto,
but abortion-rights advocates held out hope that more sympathizers
than opponents would be present for the showdown. House rules base
the number of votes needed to override on those present and voting,
not the entire membership.
   Two previous House votes approved the legislation by comfortable
margins, but short of the two-thirds to override.
   ``I really don't think the majority of the people in this state
support letting New Hampshire have the most liberal abortion law in
the nation,'' the governor said after the vote.
   Rep. Stephanie Micklon, one of the bill's sponsors, called it
patronizing and bizarre that New Hampshire refuses to make
motorcyclists wear helmets or drivers wear seat belts and allows
people to buy assault rifles under the mantle of freedom of choice,
but hasn't given abortion rights to women.
   ``All these people may make very personal choices but the women
of New Hampshire,'' she said.
   The bill also would have allowed abortions after fetal viability
to protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus has a
life-threatening physical or congenital abnormality. It would
repeal three unenforced anti-abortion statutes enacted in 1848.
   If the House had voted to override, the bill would have gone
back to the Senate for an override vote. The Senate originally
passed the bill 14-10, two shy of two-thirds.
   In his veto message, Gregg argued that the bill would authorize
abortion for ``convenience, sex selection, as a form of birth
control and with or without parental notification or consent in the
case of a minor.''
   Abortion-rights proponents had hoped to put the principles of
the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortions into state
law in case the federal court turns greater regulatory control over
abortion to the states.

   Soviets rallied Tuesday by the tens of thousands
in Moscow and Leningrad in support of two embattled prosecutors
whose anti-corruption probe has become a lightning rod for popular
resentment of Communist Party privilege.
   About 10,000 people gathered in the shadow of Moscow's Kremlin
and journalists said at least as many met in front of the former
czarist Winter Palace in Leningrad as the Supreme Soviet parliament
in Moscow considered lifting the legislative immunity of the two,
Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov.
   ``Gdlyan and Ivanov are our conscience!'' read signs carried by
the Moscow crowd.``The fate of Gdlyan and Ivanov is the fate of
democracy. Protect them!'' The two gained fame uncovering a trail
of bribery and corruption in Uzbekistan that led to the son-in-law
of the late President Leonid I. Brezhev.
   Populist communist leader Boris N. Yeltsin criticized as
incomplete a nearly yearlong investigation of Gdlyan and Ivanov by
a legislative committee, and urged the legislators to keep their
immunity intact.
   ``If today we lift parliamentary immunity from these two
deputies tomorrow the same could happen to others, because some of
us as people's deputies are already feeling pressure from many
sides,'' Yeltsin said.
   He said the Communist Party Politburo dallied for months in 1986
on a request by the prosecutors to open an investigation targeting
a former leader of the Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   The Supreme Soviet made no decision Tuesday and was expected to
continue its debate on Wednesday.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov did not attend the session. They reportedly
were in the Armenian republic, where they were nominated for vacant
Congress posts in the event they are stripped of the legislative
seats they now hold.
   Ivanov also has tied the name of conservative Politburo member
Yegor K. Ligachev to his corruption probe. The Tass news agency
said the two in a newspaper article accused Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev of ``turning a blind eye to the mafia.''
   Soviet officials accused the two of abusing their power and
making unjustified public accusations against senior leaders in an
effort to increase their popularity.
   Riding a wave of popularity, Ivanov was elected to the national
Congress of People's Deputies from Leningrad and Gdlyan was elected
from Moscow last March.
   They cannot be charged with abusing their power unless the
Supreme Soviet strips them of legislative immunity.
   The two prosecutors were taken off their cases, and on Feb. 21
were expelled from the Communist Party. They and their supporters
portray the actions as a move by party officials to protect
themselves by curbing the investigation.
   Leningrad journalist Maxim Korzhov said a crowd marching to
Leningrad's Palace Square carried a portrait of Gorbachev with the
word ``Resign!'' scrawled over it in black.
   He estimated the Leningrad crowd at 200,000. A Western
journalist on the scene reckoned it at 100,000. Neither estimate
could be confirmed.
   Crowd members chanted ``Gorbachev resign!'' and ``Down with the
KGB!'' Korzhov reported.
   Korzhov said about 30 Leningrad factories were hit by a one-hour
warning strike against lifting immunity for the prosecutors.
Speakers at the Tuesday night rally appealed for a citywide strike
if the Supreme Soviet moves against the prosecutors.
   Tass quoted Soviet national prosecutor Alexander Sukharev as
saying Gdlyan and Ivanov are guilty of detaining 50 people
illegally for periods of up to several years. They also were
accused of threatening detainees and their families to obtain
statements.
   The KGB secret police chief, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, also spoke
to parliament about the issue.
   He called the prosecutors' handling of several cases ``a typical
case example of political and penal adventurism,'' Tass said.
   ``One gets the impression that they are now doing everything to
evade responsibility for what they did.''

   Important dates in the life of the rev. Ralph
David Abernathy:
   March 11, 1926: David Abernathy is born in Linden, Ala.,
grandson of slaves and 10th of 12 children of William and Louiverny
Abernathy. A sister later calls him ``Ralph David,'' after a
teacher she admires, and Abernathy eventually lists his new name on
his military records.
   1944: Abernathy is drafted, and joins an all-black Army unit
with white officers.
   September 1945: Abernathy, having passed the high school
equivalency test, enrolls at Alabama State College, where he
becomes class president.
   1948: Named pastor of Montgomery's First Baptist Church.
   1950: Awarded diploma from Alabama State.
   1954: Begins friendship with Martin Luther King Jr., a young
Atlanta minister named pastor at Montgomery's Dexter Avenue Baptist
Church.
   Aug. 31, 1954: Marries Juanita Jones of Uniontown, Ala.
   1955: King and Abernathy begin planning how they might bring an
end to segregation in Montgomery. They lead the Montgomery bus
boycott.
   January 1957: Abernathy's Montgomery home is bombed.
   1957: King and Abernathy found the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, with King as president. Abernathy remains King's chief
aide for the next 11 years.
   1961: Abernathy becomes pastor of Atlanta's West Hunter Street
Baptist Church.
   1965: King tabs Abernathy to become his successor at SCLC, when
the time comes.
   April 4, 1968: King is assassinated in Memphis, Tenn.
   April 6, 1968: Abernathy takes over as SCLC president.
   1977: The civil rights movement is a shadow of what it was
before King's death and Abernathy has been under pressure for
months from other SCLC leaders. He resigns as SCLC president and
announces a Democratic race for the congressional seat of Andrew
Young, a movement colleague who became U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations. Abernathy loses. The Rev. oseph Lowery becomes SCLC
president.
   1980: Abernathy, along with veteran movement activist Hosea
Williams, endorses Republican Ronald Reagan for president over
incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter of Georgia, to give the black
struggle ``new meaning.'' He is widely criticized by other movement
veterans.
   January 1983: Abernathy suffers a serious stroke.
   March 1983: Undergoes brain surgery for a blocked cerebral
artery.
   1984: Abernathy, spurning Reagan, endorses the Democratic
presidential candidacy of Jesse Jackson.
   June 1986: Abernathy suffers an apparent second stroke.
   April 1989: Abernathy finishes his autobiography, ``And The
Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
   October 1989: The autobiography is published. Abernathy is
almost immediately denounced by many of the remaining movement
leaders _ including Jackson, Young and Lowery _ for a brief passage
in which he writes of King's alleged infidelity and his dalliances
with women on the night before his murder.
   March 23, 1990: Abernathy is hospitalized following a bout of
nausea, and treated for a sodium imbalance.
   April 17, 1990: Still hospitalized, Abernathy suffers a heart
attack and dies at age 64.

<HEAD>British Firm Frets It May Have Supplied Iraq With Gun Component</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British steelmaker said Tuesday it is afraid it
may have been duped into supplying Iraq with a recoil mechanism for
a giant gun.
   Walter Somers Ltd. of Birmingham issued a statement as Customs
agents resumed a major investigation into the seizure of eight
steel tubes bound for Iraq that were manufactured by rival company
Sheffield Forgemasters.
   Customs officials say the tubes could be used as part of a huge
artillery piece. Forgemasters says the tubes were part of a
petrochemical installation.
   On Sunday, Forgemasters denied the eight tubes could be joined
together as part of a towering gun to attack Iraq's Middle East
enemies or launch satellites.
   Walter Somers, a subsidiary of Eagle Trust, said engineers were
concerned that hydraulic equipment Walter Somers shipped to Iraq
last October could be used as part of a heavy-duty shock absorber,
possibly a hydraulic recoil mechanism in a huge gun.
   ``Our engineers are now wondering whether they have been misled
up the garden path by the Iraqis,'' Eagle Trust Chairman David
James said in a statement.
   Customs officials seized documents last week from Walter Somers,
which had previously manufactured pipes for Iraq, and from
Sheffield Forgemasters.
   ``The Customs investigation was very appropriate, and we are
concerned to establish the facts,'' James said. ``We think it is in
the interests of the international community as well as a national
responsibility.''
   He said the company refused to ship a component Iraq first
inquired about last October and then sent an urgent order for in
early April.
   ``Re-evaluated in the light of subsequent events and publicity,
there was concern that the component described in the order might
be used as a positioning or aiming device'' for a gigantic weapon,
he said.
   The company notified the Department of Trade and Industry of its
concern on April 9. The department declined comment Tuesday.
   James said the component in the $131,000 order was designed to
resemble a 60-degree segment of a circle, with an arc about 25 feet
across.
   ``It was intended to be laid flat on the ground as a means of
positioning or maneuvering a large pipe,'' he said. ``I can't think
of any technology where you would want to maneuver a pipe of that
size. It was to have been fabricated in a number of pieces and the
sections welded.''
   James said Walter Somers decided to re-examine its contracts
with Iraq following the murder in Brussels on March 22 of American
ballistics expert Gerald Bull. He said Bull and his company, Space
Research Corp. of Brussels, acted as agents for various Iraqi
orders and was the source of technical data and drawings related to
them.
   Belgian police said the 62-year-old Canadian-born U.S. citizen
was shot twice in the head, that the gunman used a silencer, and
the motive was not robbery because $20,000 was found in the
victim's pockets.
   In a statement Monday, Forgemasters' lawyer Stuart Benson said
the company's contract with Iraq involved Bull's Space Research
Corp., which had designed a satellite launch system.
   Customs seized eight forged steel tubes bound for Iraq on April
12. Forgemasters said it agreed to supply 52 sections of the steel
tubing for a petrochemical plant and delivered 44 to the Ministry
of Industry and Minerals in Baghdad.
   Walter Somers said Iraq had asked it to bid for a contract for
pipes like those seized, but that the company did not have the
factory capacity. James said he believed the order went to
Forgemasters.
   Walter Somers believed until now that its orders from Iraq were
for Iraq's petrochemical industry, exports licensed by the
Department of Trade and Industry, James said.
   Its previous orders with Iraq were worth about $3.1 million,
including the $90,000 hydraulic equipment deal last October, he
said.
   On March 28, British Customs officers arrested five people at
Heathrow Airport and seized 40 U.S.-made components for nuclear
bomb triggers that were being shipped to Iraq. One of those
arrested was deported, one was released and three await trial.

<HEAD>Jane's Reports Ethnic Clashes in Soviet Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ethnic tensions in the Soviet Union have
spread to the military, causing problems recruiting soldiers from
areas of unrest, Jane's Defense Weekly said Tuesday.
   The authoritative magazine said many ethnic groups were reticent
to join the armed forces and nationalist cliques within the
military caused fights and disciplinary problems.
   ``The multi-ethnic mix of the Soviet armed forces is
increasingly in doubt as the military finds itself trapped between
nationalist pressures within and outside its ranks,'' Jane's
reported.
   Since nationilist protests began in December 1986 in Kazakhstan,
ethnic riots have occured in the Soviet republics of Azerbaijan,
Armenia, Georgia, Uzbekistan and the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia.
   Initially, protests focused on assigning ethnic draftees outside
their own republics, but Jane's said it now includes recruitment
boycotts.
   Jane's quoted Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief Gen. Valentin
Varennikov as warning the military ``cannot and does not remain
aloof from (the people's) concerns, problems and misfortunes.''
   The British magazine, which has wide contacts in military
matters, also quoted a report in the Soviet army newspaper,
Krasnaya Zvezda, which said the Azeri Popular Front in Azerbaijan
had told its members not to evade conscription but to join the army
and learn combat skills ``for the struggle to free Azerbaijan.''
   ``The army is proving no more successful than the (Communist)
party in managing tensions,'' Jane's said.
   In Lithuania, since the republic declared independence on March
11, the republic's legislature halted spring conscription and many
ethnic Lithuanian soldiers deserted.

   Temperatures dipped to record lows Tuesday across the northern
Plains, and rain and snow were scattered from the Southwest to New
England.
   Severe storms late Monday and early Tuesday did scattered damage
in parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Record lows were 18 degrees at Rapid City, S.D., and 10 at
Valentine, Neb., while both Sioux Falls and Yankton, S.D., tied
their records of 19.
   The cold front that marked the edge of lower temperatures
continued to move to the southeast. About noon, Harrisburg, Pa.,
cooled from 60 to 50 degrees in half an hour when the cold front
passed.
   At midday, rain extended across much of New England,
southeastern New York state, northeastern to southwestern
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, eastern Arkansas
and northwestern Mississippi.
   Rain changed to snow at higher elevations of the central
Appalachians. Snow also was scattered over northwestern New York
state, eastern and northern Lower Michigan and eastern Upper
Michigan,
   Scattered showers fell over the central Texas coast,
northwestern and west-central Texas, central New Mexico, and along
the southern coast of California.
   Snow was scattered over the mountains of northwestern Arizona.
   Light rain also fell along the northern Pacific Coast. Freezing
rain was scattered from southeastern Wyoming into north-central
Colorado.
   Winds stronger than 90 mph plowed across central Oklahoma
overnight, uprooting trees, damaging buildings and knocking out
power to about 45,000 people. No injuries were reported.
   Most power was restored to customers Tuesday morning, said Dave
Raybern, media relations spokesman for Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric.
   A 92-mph gust at Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma City was the
strongest on record there, the National Weather Service said.
   Hail 2{ inches in diameter fell in Chandler, Okla.
   Overnight thunderstorms accompanied by high wind and large hail
also knocked out some windows and damaged some roofs in
northwestern Arkansas, the weather service said. Some areas got
more than 2 inches of rain.
   ``We don't have any reports of injuries, but there has been lots
of property damage,'' said police Cpl. Mark Howell of Rogers, Ark.
``I can confirm that there are some roofs blown off businesses,
some neon signs have been blown away and a tree was blown over on a
residence.''
   In Arkansas, hail the size of golf balls hammered Bella Vista,
Lincoln, West Fork, Prairie Grove and an area just west of
Huntsville, the weather service said. A 10-minute spurt of
three-quarter-inch hail covered the ground in Bentonville.
   In Utah, wind gusted during the night from 70 to 90 mph over
Davis and Weber counties, and to 60 mph across Cache and Box Elder
counties.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 23
degrees at the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo., to 89
at Avon Park, Fla.
   Tuesday's low in the Lower 48 states was the record 10 degrees
at Valentine, Neb.

   Leftist guerrillas on Tuesday shot to death
the former director of the Peruvian Social Security Institute and
dumped his body on a beach 20 miles south of Lima, police said.
   Officials said Felipe Santiago Salaverry's body, riddled with
four shots, was found near a sports club on the beach.
   Leaflets found near Salaverry's body indicated he was killed by
the Shining Path, a radical Maoist-inspired guerrilla group that
began its insurgency 10 years ago in the Andean highlands. More
than 18,000 people have been killed since their uprising began,
most in the mountains but more recently in Lima.
   Last year, as chief of the government's Social Security
Institute, Salaverry successfully faced down dozens of retirees
demonstrating for hikes in their social security payments.
   A member of the governing left-of-center Aprista Party,
Salaverry was a congressman from the northern Andean department of
Cajamarca from 1980-85.
   Before dawn Monday, Shining Path guerrillas also killed three
rural officials in an attack near Cuzco, 355 miles southeast of the
capital Lima, police said.
   Police said the rebels seized control of Laio, 55 miles
southeast of Cuzco, and forced villagers to witness a mock trial of
the mayor, the justice of peace and the district governor, a
representative of the central government.
   The guerrillas then shot the men in the back of the head.
   In other violence, a former Aprista mayor of Chiquian was shot
to death by Shining Path guerrillas Monday night. Chiquian, in
Ancash department, is 130 miles north of the Lima.

   The Justice Department disclosed Tuesday it
won a court order for records of 754 U.S. bank accounts where it
said Colombia's Medellin cartel stashed $400 million from cocaine
sales on American streets
   The action marks the first time that federal authorities traced
``dollar for dollar'' drug money from U.S. street sales that was
laundered through foreign accounts and returned to American banks,
officials said.
   The department obtained a court order in Atlanta directing 173
banks in 22 states and the nation's capital to turn over the
records that officials said could yield a wealth of financial
information about the cartel.
   The order signed Monday by a federal judge in Atlanta also
directed banks to freeze 684 accounts linked to Eduardo Martinez
Romero, who was extradited in September to face charges he
laundered drug money for the cartel, or others charged in the case,
including reputed cartel leader Pablo Escobar.
   Based on information contained in the records, the Justice
Department plans to seek similar court orders in Miami and New York
against other accounts, officials said.
   The legal action is likely to produce more information than
money, but should help investigators continue their pursuit along
the global money trail left by the cocaine dealers, said Peter G.
Djinis, a Justice Department trial attorney.
   ``We think this is going to point fingers in a lot of
directions,'' he said. ``We're getting closer and we'll eventually
catch up'' to the money.
   Agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal
Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service participating in the
long-running ``Operation Polar Cap'' probe of the Colombian cartel
traced the money through eight foreign countries.
   The investigation determined that the cartel amassed $1.2
billion from selling cocaine in the United States between 1987 and
early 1989. The funds were deposited in American banks and
transferred overseas.
   Some of the money was invested in foreign countries or used to
buy equipment and supplies for cocaine production, officials said.
An estimated $350 million was wired back to U.S. banks and
deposited with $50 million that was left behind.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the department's action
``seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the financial network of
these narco-terrorists.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the money was
traced through banks in Colombia, Panama, Uruguay, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Britain, Canada and Austria.
   The review of the bank records, obtained with the cooperation of
the foreign countries, began almost a year ago, officials said.
   In Miami, U.S. Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett said the bank
accounts could not have been traced without the help of Panama.
   ``We have been working very closely with the government of
Panama,'' she said.
   Djinis said officials don't know how much of the $400 million is
still in the accounts. The records could also confirm suspicions
that the cartel bought U.S. real estate, he said.
   The accounts were listed under the names of Martinez or other
people, Djinis said. The 2-year-old son of a cartel member was
listed as the holder of a Panamanian bank account, officials said.
   The cartel needed money in American bank accounts ``to keep up
the payroll'' and buy such equipment as aircraft for the shipment
of cocaine, Djinis said.
   ``The only way to administer these activities is to have ongoing
capital in the U.S,'' he said.
   In one case, money was drawn from an account to buy an
American-made airplane, which was flown to Colombia to pick up a
load of cocaine. The plane made a crash landing in Canada with its
cargo intact, Djinis said.
   ``We are not at this time suggesting the banks had knowledge and
were knowing and willing participants in the return of the funds to
the U.S.'' Djinis said. But ``we are not ruling out anything.''
   Bank officials suspicious of the large cash deposits reported
their concerns to federal law enforcement authorities, Djinis said.
   The investigation is only one of a number of large-scale probes
of money laundering, said a law enforcement official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said there are as many as 10 other investigations
under way.

   A lava flow from Kilauea Volcano has
re-entered a rural subdivision and was threatening Tuesday to take
more homes in its path, authorities said.
   The lava was building up early Tuesday against a 4-foot-high
stone wall at the boundary of a vacant lot in the Kalapana Gardens
subdivision, according to Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesman
Bruce Butts.
   A house which escaped being overrun by another flow on April 2
is just 80 yards on the other side of the wall, Butts said.
   If the flow continues, the house probably will be destroyed,
after the lava spills over the wall, he said.
   Another house sits about 50 or 60 yards from the nearest house,
and four or five others are in the vicinity, he said.
   About 25 or 30 families were ordered to evacuate. Residents of
remaining homes in the subdivision remain on alert.
   Lava flows have destroyed 80 homes and caused more than $20
million in damage since the eruption began more than seven years
ago.

<TEXT>
   Oklahoma's teacher strike spread Tuesday
with thousands more planning to join later in the week, and
teachers continued to picket the state Capitol demanding increased
funding for education.
   At least one school board voted to close schools to allow its
teachers to join the protest.
   About 60 percent of the state's teachers, or about 20,000, were
of the job on the second day of the strike, said the Oklahoma
Education Association, the teacher union that called for the
walkout. That was up from about 16,000 Monday.
   ``We think it's growing,'' said Sandy Garrett, education
secretary in Gov. Henry Bellmon's Cabinet. ``We're hearing from
more and more schools that are going to be closed the rest of the
week.''
   Ms. Garrett estimated that the walkout had affected about 60
percent, or 343,200, of the state's 572,000 students.
   Teachers are venting their frustration over the Legislature's
failure after an eight-month special session to enact a $230
million school reform and tax plan that contains funds for
increased teacher salaries.
   The education package calls for raising the money by increasing
sales and personal and corporate income taxes. It mandates
$1,500-per-year increases in teachers' minimum salary schedules
over the next four years, eventually boosting that from the present
$15,000 a year to about $24,000.
   The OEA says Oklahoma teachers rank 48th in teacher pay among
the states, making an average $22,000 a year, far less than the
national average of $29,648.
   Officials in Oklahoma City and other municipalities not yet
participating in the walkout decided Tuesday to close schools later
in the week to allow their teachers to join those on the picket
lines.
   The Oklahoma City School Board voted to use one of its ``snow
days'' on Thursday to allow the closing of schools. Oklahoma City
has about 2,200 teachers.
   That announcement brought a round of cheers from those picketing
at the Capitol. The majority of Oklahoma City teachers are not
affiliated with the OEA and officials of their union, the American
Federation of Teachers, initially balked at joining the walkout.
   In Tulsa, Superintendent Bruce Howell canceled schools for the
rest of the week because of the prospects of ``an emergency
jeopardizing the health and safety of children.''
   A decision had been made earlier to close Tulsa schools only on
Monday and Tuesday. But Howell said about 80 percent of teachers
indicated they would not be in class Wednesday.
   Officials estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 people walked picket
lines at the Capitol on Tuesday.
   Karla Feeley, OEA communications director and a spokeswoman for
the Department of Education, estimated there were 35,000
non-supervisory teachers in the state. The education agency said an
earlier figure of 40,052 teachers includedsome principals and other
school personnel.
   The OEA says it represents about 31,000 teachers.
   The education bill stalled on the Senate calendar last week when
leaders were unable to get the two-thirds majority needed to attach
an emergency clause, which would have made the measure take effect
immediately.
   Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison said there were
discussions in Tulsa over the weekend on a possible alternate tax
package more legislators might support. But he said there was no
firm indication the deadlock can be broken.

<HEAD>Peres Says He Will Present Minority Government Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Tuesday he
will present a minority government for parliamentary approval next
week, Israel television reported.
   Last week, Peres tried to present a majority government but his
efforts collapsed when two last-minute defections from an
ultra-Orthodox party prevented him from securing the necessary 61
votes in the 120-member parliament.
   Under Israeli law, Peres can form a government with less than 61
seats if his party has the support of more legislators than any
other coalition and no party can muster a majority.
   Peres did not say which other parties would join his government
_ every Israeli government since its founding in 1948 has been a
coalition _ or how many seats it would have.
   Israel's two major parties, Peres' left-leaning Labor and acting
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud, each have the
support of almost 60 legislators. But their ability to produce a
majority has depended on small religious parties and defectors who
have proven unstable in their support.
   Peres' statement comes almost a month after he was designated by
President Chaim Herzog to form Israel's next government.
   Peres said he will still trying to form a majority government.
   Both Peres and Shamir have been placing their hopes on the
support of the ultra-Orthodox Shas, or Sephardic Torah Guardian,
party, which has now become a powerbroker of sorts with its five
members in parliament.
   The spiritual mentor of Shas, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is scheduled
to meet with both Peres and Shamir on Wednesday to decide which
party he will recommend supporting, the television said.
   Peres has been trying to put together a coalition with
left-wing, Arab and ultra-Orthodox parties since Labor engineered
the collapse of the national unity government on March 15 after the
Likud refused to accept a U.S. peace proposal.
   On March 20, Herzog gave him three weeks to form a new
government, but Peres was granted a two-week extension when his
efforts collapsed.

<HEAD>D.C. Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Barney Frank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A District of Columbia judge has dismissed a
lawsuit against Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., alleging that Frank's
relationship with a male prostitute amounted to a public nuisance,
Frank's office said Tuesday.
   The suit alleged that Frank was aware his Capitol Hill apartment
was being used by Stephen Gobie for his prostitution business.
   Superior Court Judge Harold Cushenberry dismissed the suit on
the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to bring it and that
any alleged nuisance was clearly not continuing.
   The one-page decision, dated April 10, was released by Frank's
office Tuesday as Frank, in Boston, was announcing his candidacy
for a sixth term.
   The suit was filed two ministers of Washington churches, the
Rev. Cleveland B. Sparrow Sr. and the Rev. John G. Martin. It was
financially backed by the Conservative Caucus, which has long
opposed many of Frank's liberal views. John F. Banzhaf III, a law
professor at George Washington University and a legal gadfly who
has pressed a number of high-profile cases in Washington, helped
prepare it.
   Frank has admitted paying Gobie for sexual favors and hiring him
as a personal aide.
   Attorneys for Frank argued that Frank was unaware of Gobie's
prostitution business; that Frank fired Gobie as soon as he found
out; that Frank no longer lived in the Capitol Hill apartment and
that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue Frank.
   In his one-page order, Cushenberry wrote that he ``concluded
that an ongoing statutory violation is required'' to seek an
injunction against Frank blocking the alleged nuisance and that the
plaintiffs ``have failed to allege the `special damage' that must
be pleaded in order for a private party to prosecute a public
nuisance claim.''
   Banzhaf tried an unusual legal tactic in which, technically, the
suit was being brought by the United States government. ``What I
tried to do was use a very unusual and heretofore untested statute
to deal with an unusual situation,'' Banzhaf said. ``In that area,
it's very difficult to predict what the court will do and it's not
unusual not to win.''
   Banzhaff has said he would explore other avenues to bring a case
against Frank.

   Barbara and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of the
Rev. Ralph David Abernathy.
   In recalling Ralph Abernathy's life, we inevitably recall the
great campaigns for civil rights for black Americans in which he
played such a significant part.
   From his father's farm in Alabama, he joined the ministry and
became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery. Responding
to Rosa Parks' refusal to sit in the back of a segregated bus, he
and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., began the Montgomery
Improvement Association to insure the success of the boycott which
led in turn to the desegregation of buses in that city.
   Later, he and Dr. King organized the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, of which he originally served as
secretary-treasurer. Throughout, Rev. Abernathy was committed to
the principle of non-violence. As he said, ``Violence is the weapon
of the weak, and non-violence is the weapon of the strong.''
   Barbara and I join with all Americans to mourn the passing of
the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a great leader in the struggle for civil
rights for all Americans and a tireless campaigner for justice.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian officials expect Moscow to begin
cutbacks of oil and natural gas supplies early Wednesday to enforce
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threatened economic embargo on the wayward
republic, local sources said.
   Lithuanian Energy Minister Leonas Asmantas told a news
conference late Tuesday the republic received unofficial
information crude oil supplies would be reduced about 7 a.m.
Wednesday (Tuesday midnight EDT) and that natural gas supplies
would be scaled back too, said official spokesmen and Western
journalists on the scene.
   Asmantas was quoted as saying gas supplies might be cut 50
percent.
   Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene told Lithuanians to view the move
as the ``beginning of liberty,'' because it signified Moscow's
recognition of Lithuania as a separate entity from the Soviet
Union, said one Western journalist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania had been contacted by U.S. and
Canadian petroleum companies who ``are inclined to come to our
rescue,'' but did not specify which companies or how they could
deliver supplies.
   Asmantas said he had no official word, but believed _ based on
Moscow sources _ that the cuts would occur imminently.
   Worried Lithuanians flooded the government in Vilnius with phone
calls Tuesday.
   Last Friday, Gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of key
goods and raw materials unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours
several laws meant to back up its March 11 declaration of
independence.
   Moscow would demand hard currency from Lithuania for supplies of
materials the Soviet Union sells abroad for convertible currency,
the Soviet president said. Oil and gas are the Soviet Union's
biggest earners of foreign currency.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis on Tuesday called the
republic's decisions ``irreversible'' and said an economic embargo
will only strengthen the resolve of the 3.8 million Lithuanians.
   ``I hope it will consolidate our people in our peaceful
struggle,'' Landsbergis said in a broadcast interview.
   Lithuanian gas officials received a telegram from the acting
general director of the Soviet Union's western gas network saying:
   ``Implementing the orders of the government of the Soviet Union
and those of the state gas concern ... supplies of natural gas to
the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic will be sharply reduced
from the 17th of Apri.''
   Sources in the capital, Vilnius, said the republic was receiving
its full supply of natural gas late Tuesday night.
   However, the Western journalist quoted gas officials as saying
they regarded the telegram received late Monday as 24-hour advance
notice the supply would be reduced, and they expected a cut to
begin overnight.
   Nearly all Western journalists were forced by the Soviet
government to leave Lithuania last month, though a few remain.
   Lithuanian officials are discussing shifting some oil and gas
from industrial production to use in homes and hospitals if the
cuts occur, but so far have not publicly discussed a conservation
program.
   Lithuania uses 18.5 million cubic meters of natural gas a day,
including 1.1 million cubic meters for homes.
   President Bush said in Washington the United States was
considering ``appropriate responses'' if supplies are cut. But he
also said he does not want to damage superpower relations.
   Italy's foreign minister, Gianni De Michelis, met Gorbachev on
Tuesday and quoted him as saying he had to uphold the Soviet
constitution but was still looking for a peaceful way out of the
dispute ``without abrupt moves.''
   De Michelis told Italian journalists that Gorbachev complained
the Lithuanians discussed a law on the republic's official language
for six months, but debated independence for only half a night.
   At the United Nations in New York, Nadia Younes, the spokeswoman
for Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Tuesday he
considers the Lithuanian issue to be ``strictly an internal
affair'' of the Soviet Union.
   Hundreds of Bulgarian protesters chanted ``Leave Lithuania
alone!'' as they rallied Tuesday in front of the Soviet Embassy in
Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, in the first anti-Soviet protest
there in memory.
   Gorbachev says Lithuanian independence can be discussed only
within the framework of Soviet law. A law passed this month would
let republics secede if they gain approval of two-thirds of their
residents in a referendum and wait a maximum of five years.
   The Kremlin forcibly annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in
1940.
   Tass news agency quoted Landsbergis as saying, in opening
Tuesday's discussion in the Lithuanian Supreme Council legislature,
that Lithuania's pro-independence moves were ``irreversible,'' but
that the republic ``will search for a dialogue by all possible
means, through various channels.''
   Landsbergis asked Bush to make it clear to Gorbachev an economic
embargo on Lithuania would be an act of aggression, but he declined
to say if he thought Bush should cancel a planned Washington summit
with Gorbachev in June.
   In a Tuesday interview from Vilnius with Cable News Network,
Landsbergis also said he expects to receive supplies from
neighboring Soviet republics and even from Scandinavia, but was
worried the Soviet navy may interfere.
   Speaker Alexandras Abisalas read the gas supply telegram to
Lithuanian lawmakers, who met to discuss a response to Gorbachev's
ultimatum.
   Tass said Gorbachev's message caused a sharp legislative debate
between deputies who found it full of threats and others who want
to compromise. No decision was reached Tuesday on an official
response.
   The agency quoted Landsbergis as saying an embargo on Lithuania
would result in economic losses for other Soviet republics.
   Lithuania produces about twice the milk and meat it needs. It
produces many of the country's small electronic appliances and all
of its household electric meters.
   Lithuanian journalists quoted officials as saying Monday that
the republic had enough natural gas to last about two weeks. The
officials warned that an embargo would throw ethnic Russian factory
workers out of work and affect the Kaliningrad area of the Russian
republic as well.
   Viktoras Barmuskas, a spokesman for the information bureau of
the Supreme Council legislature, quoted Energy Minister Asmantas as
saying Lithuania's oil refinery at Mazhiekiai would be entitled to
demand compensation in hard currency for lost production.
   Asmantas said the plant produces 12 million tons of oil products
a year valued at $800 million, with only a quarter of the output
used in Lithuania and the rest sent to other parts of the Soviet
Union..
   On Monday, Mrs. Prunskiene sent a reply to Gorbachev, asking for
a meeting to clarify the threat of an economic blockade.
   In his message, Gorbachev had singled out Lithuanian moves to
curtail the spring draft into the Soviet Army, give residents
Lithuanian identity cards and what he said were seize the property
of the Communist Party on Lithuanian territory.

   A small crowd turned out for a rally
Tuesday to mark the six months that have passed since an earthquake
battered the San Francisco Bay area, leaving 68 people dead.
   About 150 people gathered a few yards from the ruined
Embarcadero Freeway and mingled around tables with displays on
earthquake safety.
   ``You've got to have a foot-long wrench to shut down the gas
meter when an earthquake hits,'' a hard-hatted Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. worker explained to an elderly woman.
   The event marked the 15 seconds of terror that struck at 5:04
p.m. on Oct. 17. In addition to the toll on lives, the earthquake,
centered 80 miles to the south, destroyed or damaged about 15,000
homes and left the Embarcadero Freeway, sometimes called the
Chinatown Freeway, cracked and useless. The city has tentatively
voted in favor of tearing down the freeway.
   In one terrible crash of steel and concrete, an elevated section
of Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed, killing 42 people.
   A mile away, a 50-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed, bringing chaos to the entire bay freeway system
for a month.
   On Tuesday, volunteers handed out pamphlets and disaster
checklists, and showed pictures of the destruction from San
Francisco south to Watsonville. They explained what people could do
when the next earthquake strikes.
   The St. Francis Hook &amp; Ladder Society, a club for firefighting
buffs, proudly displayed a long-retired, 30-year-old pumper truck
that was pressed into duty the night of the disaster.
   ``We actually jump-started this rig, loaded some hoses and stuff
and fought fires and made calls for two days starting October 17,''
said city firefighter Steve Van Dyke.

   The Security Council unanimously
recommended Tuesday that Namibia become the United Nations' 160th
member.
   ``Namibia's birth has been protracted and difficult,'' U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the council. ``But it now
appears that the star under which she comes into the world shines
brightly.''
   The Republic of Namibia will be formally admitted when the
General Assembly votes Monday at the opening of a special session
to promote economic growth in the developing world.
   Its membership is expected to be accepted by acclamation and
Namibia will take its seat and participate Monday in the special
session.
   Namibia, Africa's last colony, won its freedom from South Africa
last month.
   The United Nations made Namibia's freedom a major cause for many
years and monitored its transition to independence and its free
elections.
   Security Council President Tesfaye Tadesse, the Ethiopian
ambassador, said Namibia's admission will be a milestone in African
history and the culmination of decades of work by the United
Nations.
   ``Namibia's admission will be a tribute to the courage and
sacrifice of the Namibian people. They have waged a long struggle
for self-determination and independence,'' he said.
   Nations are admitted to the United Nations upon recommendation
by the 15-member Security Council and a two-thirds vote by the
General Assembly.

   Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized for a
week with a persistent fever and sinus infection, has been
transferred by ambulance to a larger hospital for treatment of
pneumonia, her doctor said Tuesday.
   ``I would like to dispel the plethora of rumors that have been
circulating that I have an AIDS-related condition,'' Miss Taylor,
58, said in a statement released by her New York City-based
publicist, Chen Sam. ``I feel it is important that people should
not be afraid to be tested for AIDS.
   ``I have an annual physical and have been tested for the disease
and the test results are negative,'' Miss Taylor said.
   The actress entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 10
for what was reported as ``a severe sinus infection.'' She was
expected to be released Saturday, but her condition worsened and
she was moved Monday to St. John's Hospital and Health Center five
miles away.
   ``In conducting further tests on Elizabeth Taylor, her results
reveal her to be suffering from pneumonia,'' Miss Taylor's
physician, Dr. Patricia Murray, said in the same statement.
   ``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics
and will remain hospitalized,'' said Murray, an infectious disease
specialist.
   Miss Taylor's whereabouts had been a mystery for several days.
She is registered at St. John's under the favored alias of ``Beth
Warner.'' Her most recent husband was Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,
particularly recurring back troubles from the filming of the 1945
movie ``National Velvet,'' when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor entered the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho
Mirage to deal with alcohol and drug abuse problems.

   A pioneer in physical organic chemistry from
Harvard University and another from the California Institute of
Technology will share the 1990 Welch Award in Chemistry and a
$250,000 prize, a foundation announced Tuesday.
   William von Eggers Doering, 72, of Harvard and John D. Roberts,
71, of Caltech are the first pair to receive the honor presented
annually since 1972 to a major figure in chemistry.
   ``These two men have been primary intellectual forces over more
than four decades in a development that represents one of the great
advances in the history of science _ the creation of modern
physical organic chemistry,'' said Jack S. Josey, president of the
Houston-based Welch Foundation.
   Each man will be presented with a gold medal and his $125,000
share of the prize at a Houston banquet Oct. 22.
   Doering, a Fort Worth native, is a professor emeritus of
chemistry at Harvard, where he has been a professor since 1967. He
is known by contemporary chemists for his work on how hydrocarbon
molecules change under various conditions, particularly different
temperatures.
   Roberts, a Log Angeles native, is institute professor emeritus
of chemistry at Caltech. He is best known for pioneering the use of
nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to analyze the structure of
chemical compounds. His NMR technique is considered one of the most
widely used tools in chemistry today and was the forerunner of
magnetic resonance imaging in medicine.

   A Jerusalem District Court panel on Tuesday
upheld an order to evict 150 Jewish settlers whose move into the
Arab Christian quarter of the Old City has fueled anti-Israeli
protests.
   The settlers immediately appealed the decision, but it was
rejected by the same District Court in a hearing before a single
judge. In that hearing, Judge Ruth Orr ordered the settlers to
evacuate the building by Wednesday morning, army radio said.
   Jerusalem Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said police were studying
the court decision.
   The settlers said they plan to appeal the eviction order to the
Supreme Court. They also said they would not resist police attempts
to evict them.
   ``Of course we will not resist the police,'' said one settler
who identified himself as Doki. ``But there is no reason for them
to come tomorrow.''
   Early Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the District Court
conferred nearly four hours behind closed doors before issuing a
ruling that accused the settlers' lawyers of ``an improper use of
procedures, to say the least''
   The judges ruled that a stay of the eviction notice granted
Friday by a single District Court judge was improperly obtained.
``We invalidate it,'' the judges wrote.
   They took the unusual step of assessing court costs of $5,000 to
the settlers' lawyers, apparently for attempting to thwart the
Israeli legal system.
   Judge Vardimus Zailer presided over the three-judge panel, which
also included Judge Shalom Brenner, who on Friday stayed the
eviction order.
   The ruling said the settlers' lawyers, in asking Brenner for a
stay, had failed to mention another judge turned down a separate
request for a stay hours earlier.
   ``The judges have canceled the stay. They (the settlers) must be
evicted,'' said Avraham Sochozolsky, a lawyer for the Greek
Orthodox Church.
   Yacov Levine, a spokesman for the settlers group, said their
lawyers sought a new District Court hearing late Tuesday to argue
that the building was rented legally.
   At that five-hour hearing, Judge Orr rejected the settler appeal
and ordered their eviction.
   The settler move into the complex has raised tensions in the old
walled city, which is divided into ethnic quarters that are home to
about 50,000 Moslems, 7,000 Christians and 4,000 Jews.
   Early Tuesday, several dozen Palestinian women and masked youths
demonstrated inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, venerated as
the site of Christ's burial and regarded by many as Christianity's
holiest shrine.
   Visiting pilgrims and tourists stared as 40 to 50 protesters
waved Palestinian flags and chanted ``PLO! PLO!'' and ``Israel no!
Palestine yes!'' inside the dark church.
   It was the first time Arabs had staged a protest inside the
church since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip began 28 months ago.
   A week ago, the ultra-Orthodox Jews moved into a 72-room complex
near the church under heavy police guard, saying they wanted to
establish the first Jewish presence in the Christian Quarter since
1936.
   The Greek Orthodox Church, which owns the property, said a
tenant in the four 100-year-old buildings illegally worked out a
lease with the Jews. The church sued to have the Jewish settlers
removed.
   The establishment of Neot David, which is Hebrew for ``Dwellings
of David,'' was the largest and most significant settlement of Jews
outside the Jewish quarter.
   Previously, two Jewish seminaries were set up in the Moslem
Quarter and about 40 Jewish families took up residence in the area,
including former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.
   Sharon has visited Neot David daily to show support for the
settlement.
   In a visit to the settlement and Greek Orthodox Church
headquarters Tuesday, Religious Affairs Minister Zevulen Hammer
urged both Christians and Jews ``not to blow things out of
proportion.''
   ``They (the settlers) did not take over some church and did not
throw someone out of some place but used a site that was a hotel
... that happens to be in the Christian quarter,'' he said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip Tuesday, Israeli troops opened fire
on stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding 23 Palestinians, hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed 21 of the wounded.
   Since the start of the uprising, at least 673 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. Another 207
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaboration with Israel, and 43 Israelis have died in the
violence.

   An Indian church leader said Tuesday the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling that peyote use in religious ceremonies
isn't protected by the Constitution is an example of how little
society understands Indians.
   Peyote is not a recreational drug used by participants to get
high, said Emerson Jackson, a peyote priest and president of the
Native American Church of North America.
   ``We have been doing this all these years before the
Constitution was here. I don't see why we can't continue,'' he said
in a telephone interview from Albuquerque, N.M.
   The high court ruled 6-3 that Oregon officials may deny
unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who took small
amounts of peyote, a cactus ``button'' containing the hallucinogen
mescaline, in Indian religious ceremonies.
   Alfred Smith and Galen Black were denied the benefits because
they violated their employers' rules by using the illegal drug in
Native American Church ceremonies.
   Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer said the ruling involved
whether the men were entitled to a government benefit, not whether
they'd committed a crime.
   Frohnmayer said the court was making it clear that in terms of
religious freedom, the Constitution ``is written in terms of what
the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what
individuals can extract from government.''
   ``The court said the state is not compelled to make exemptions
for religious use of drugs but said it could if it wished,'' he
said. ``We have always insisted the state is not required to pay
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious
beliefs might be.''
   Jackson said that wine, used as a sacrament in many religious
ceremonies, is more toxic habit-forming than peyote.
   Jackson, a Navajo Indian, also said he is waiting for a change
of administration in Oregon so that a centuries-old ritual can
continue.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' he said. ``Perhaps there will be
a time when their administration will be more favorable to how the
Indian worships. The attorney general is not going to stay there
forever.''
   Lenora Begay, spokeswoman for the Navajo Tribe in Washington,
D.C., denounced the ruling.
   ``To punish individuals because of their religious beliefs is
beyond comprehension and ... an act of extreme ignorance,'' she
said.
   Ellen Lowe, spokeswoman for Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon,
said the ministries disagreed with the court's ruling.
   ``We see it as an infringement on what we have long felt to be
First Amendment rights for freedom of religion,'' she said. ``For
those of us in majority faiths, there are some exceptions we have
taken for granted.''
   She cited serving wine to minors during church ceremonies as an
example.
   The Native American Church is an umbrella group for 70 chapters
of the church in Western states.

   Officials believe the seven rioters
holding out at Strangeways Prison are using drugs from the jail
pharmacy, a Home Office spokesman said Tuesday.
   One convict nearly fell off the roof Tuesday, 17th day of the
uprising, as he shouted and lobbed slates at a security video
camera mounted on a wall below.
   ``Judging by his face and eyes, he seems to have been using
drugs. And he was standing there pretending to inject himself,''
said the spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with British
custom.
   He said the inmates controlled the pharmacy, but never had the
prison hospital, where most of the prison's drugs are stored.
   The spokesman said no negotiations have taken place since three
prisoners surrendered Monday, suffering from food poisoning.
   There have been no fresh supplies in the Victorian jail since
the mutiny began on April 1.
   More than 1,500 prisoners rioted at the overcrowded prison,
badly damaging the buildings. Most surrendered in the first days
but a hard core remained on the loose.
   On Sunday, prisoners held up a sign saying they would continue
their standoff for another week.
   Inmates stockpiled food before the riot but there is no
refrigeration in the wing they are occupying.

<TEXT>
   The Chinese student dissident leader who fled to
France after 10 months in hiding said Tuesday that underground
resistance groups exist throughout China and include soldiers and
government workers.
   Chai Ling and her husband, Feng Congde, escaped three weeks ago
from China, where they had been on the run from authorities. Both
were on the wanted list of 21 students who led demonstrations last
spring for greater political freedom.
   In an interview Tuesday with the French television network TF1,
Miss Chai said the Chinese underground spirited them out of the
country to safety in the West. She declined to give details.
   ``We can say there exist in China a certain number of resistance
organizations, some bigger and more important than others,'' said
Miss Chai, speaking in Chinese translated into French.
   ``Certain ones are formed by students, by workers, by
intellectuals,'' she said. ``In some of these groups you'll find
soldiers, members of the government and cadres.''
   Miss Chai, who turned 24 Saturday, wore a blue sweater and
showed no sign of the fatigue apparent in an interview broadcast by
a Taiwan television station April 2.
   ``I didn't celebrate by birthday, but I have really tasted
liberty'' since arriving in Paris, she said. ``Many of my
colleagues will not taste this freedom. That makes me very sad.''
   Miss Chai, a graduate student at Beijing Normal University when
she in effect took over the student-led democracy movement in
Beijing last June, will give her first public news conference
Wednesday at the Arche de la Defense, the ultramodern skyscraper
outside Paris.
   Earlier Tuesday, organizers announced they are planning rock
concerts in Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Taipei, Prague and Sao
Paulo on June 3 to commemorate the anniversary of the crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   The concerts were announced at a news conference called by the
Front for a Democratic China, a Paris-based dissident group, and by
the French news magazine Actuel.
   They said some top musicians would record a special version of
John Lennon's song ``Imagine'' in conjunction with the anniversary.
No further details were disclosed.
   The federation and the magazine are among the sponsors of ``A
Boat for China,'' which is sending a radio-equipped ship to the Far
East to transmit pro-democracy broadcasts into China.
   Representatives of the federation and the magazine repeated
claims first made Monday that the ship has been the target of
surveillance and harassment by Chinese officials since it left
France a month ago.
   According to the sponsors, the 260-foot Goddess of Democracy is
now heading across the Indian Ocean to Singapore after being held
up in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, for 10 days.
   The 1,200-ton ship _ a former British oceanographic vessel _ is
equipped with two radio studios and a television studio. Its crew
hopes to begin broadcasting music and news into China from
international waters by the end of April.
   Chinese diplomats have formally protested to the French
government about the boat, but were told there was no official
French involvement in the project.
   France rejected a Chinese request to restrict news coverage of
the operation.
   Robert Menard, a spokesman for a press freedom advocacy group
called Reporters Without Borders, said Tuesday that Chinese
officials had threatened to deny visas to some French television
journalists if they reported about the radio ship. But FR-3, one of
the TV channels mentioned by Menard, said it had received no such
threats.

   The Justice Department told the Supreme Court
Tuesday that a 1989 federal law banning flag burning is
constitutional because it outlaws ``violent assault'' on the symbol
of the nation's ``shared experiences.''
   Unlike a Texas flag-burning statute that the high court
overturned last year, the Flag Protection Act of 1989 expresses
``the depth of the national interest in protecting the flag'' the
department said in brief supporting the new statute.
   The law, passed in response to the high court's ruling in the
Texas case, represents ``the considered judgment of Congress _ as
opposed to that of a single state legislature,'' the department
argued.
   ``Congress, the president _ the nation's elected representatives
_ have now spoken with one voice: the physical integrity of the
flag of the United States, as the unique symbol of the nation,
merits protection not accorded other national emblems,'' the
department said.
   In deciding whether the law is constitutional, the justices
should consider that Congress also studied this question, making a
``legislative determination that the American flag is a unique
national symbol deserving special protection consistent with
applicable First Amendment limitations.''
   The government's brief was filed to appeal the dismissal of
misdemeanor criminal charges against demonstrators who burned flags
outside the U.S. Capitol and in Seattle last fall to test the new
law.
   The previous federal statute banned destruction of or damage to
the flag ``with contempt,'' similar to the provision in a Texas
statute found unconstitutional on free-speech grounds by the
Supreme Court. The new law simply dropped any reference to the
state of mind of the person doing the action.
   Nonetheless, federal judges in the District of Columbia and in
Seattle held that flag burning under the new law was still
political speech protected by the First Amendment.
   ``Flag burning is, by its nature, a physical, violent assault on
the most deeply shared experiences of the American people,
including the sacrifices of our fellow citizens in defense of the
nation and the preservation of liberty,'' the department said in
the brief by Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr.
   The law does not violate the First Amendment because it does not
restrict debate about the flag; it merely prohibits physical
attacks on the national symbol, the department said.
   ``It is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the
flag's physical integrity _ not robust and uninhibited debate _
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon
to bear,'' the brief said.
   The high court should treat flag burning the same way it views
obscene or defamatory speech, the Justice Department said, citing a
list of cases in which the high court upheld prohibitions on child
pornography or speech that incited violence or illegal activity.

<HEAD>Bush Wants Global-Change Studies; Europeans Call for Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush called for more research ``to
sort out the science'' of global warming Tuesday, but ran into a
storm of criticism at an international White House conference from
Europeans who argued for action.
   ``Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide
inaction,'' declared Klaus Topfer, the West German environmental
minister.
   Bush said he hoped the conference, attended by delegates from 19
nations, would prod international research and inject economic
issues into the debate over the ``greenhouse'' effect.
   The president called for resolving some of the scientific
uncertainties and economic implications before making a commitment
to specific pollution controls to deal with possible gradual
warming of the Earth.
   ``Environmental policies that ignores the economic factors _ the
human factors _ are destined to fail,'' he said, maintaining anew
that some scientists are in wide disagreement over the impact of
manmade pollutants on the temperature of the globe.
   Many of the European participants, especially the West Germans
and the Dutch, said the conference agenda was narrowly arranged to
prevent open discussions of policy aimed at dealing with global
warming.
   Topfer suggested the German delegation would pursue such
discussions, adding, ``The gravity of the situation requires
immediate, determined action.''
   Similar views were expressed by members of other delegations,
including Dutch and French officials.
   Discussions about further research and economic considerations
should ``not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide
stabilization now,'' Hans Alders, the Dutch environmental minister,
told the conference during a closed working session.
   ``We needed Love Canal before hazardous waste was tackled. We
needed a dying River Rhine before waste water was treated. ... My
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on
global warming now,'' Alders told the delegates, according to a
transcript made public by the Dutch delegation.
   ``I know there's a debate raging out there,'' Bush said in his
welcoming remarks to the delegates, all Cabinet-level ministers
involved in environmental, economic and science issues. But he said
he was confident that more research and examination of economic
factors before action to curb ``greenhouse'' pollutants such as
carbon dioxide ``is the way to go.''
   At back-to-back news conferences later in the day, senior White
House officials and leaders of the European Community sought to
play down the extent of the discord at the conference and said the
day's sessions had produced considerable ``common ground'' on the
need for additional scientific and economic research.
   ``We didn't come here to argue with the United States or anybody
else,'' said Padraig Flynn, environment minister for the European
Council, a branch of the European Community.
   Allan Bromley, the president's science adviser and a co-chairman
of the conference, told reporters that Bush ``does not feel in any
sense that research should be a substitute for action.''
   And Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers and also a conference co-chairman, maintained the
discord was ``very narrowly confined to a few delegations.''
   Scientists, including Bush's own science adviser, generally
agree that manmade pollution, especially the release of carbon
dioxide from burning of fossil fuels, is causing heat to be trapped
and will result in a warming of the globe. Many say the Earth's
temperature could increase by as much as 4 degrees to 9 degrees
Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, causing coastal
flooding and a shift of weather and agriculture patterns.
   Environmentalists have urged immediate action by industrial
countries to curb carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and many
of the European countries have called at least for a stabilization
of such releases by the year 2000. Such a commitment would require
new efforts at energy conservation, development of more fuel
efficient automobiles and more efficient use of energy in homes and
businesses.
   Meanwhile, U.S. environmentalists accused Bush on Tuesday of
abandoning his leadership responsibilities on the global warming
question by not joining the Europeans in a call for firm
commitments to reduce global warming pollutants.
   ``Bush is using the conference as a smoke screen to hide his
inaction. He's using economics as a weapon against environmental
protection,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.
   Rafe Pomerance, of the World Resources Institute, chided Bush
for suggesting that scientists are at opposite poles on the global
warming debate. He said there is widespread agreement that the
earth will become warmer if pollution curbs are not put into effect.
   At a luncheon address to the conference, William Reilly, head of
the Environmental Protection Agency, maintained the Bush
administration has taken actions to combat global warming.
   He cited the push to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which are another major cause of global warming; a call by Bush to
plant 1 billion trees a year, and efforts to toughen federal air
pollution laws, as well as a $1 billion global change research
effort.
   But environmentalists maintained the tree planting effort will
have scant effect on overall carbon dioxide pollution and that the
administration vigorously fought efforts in Congress to require
automakers to develop more fuel efficient cars, which would have
allowed for significant carbon dioxide reductions by the end of the
decade. Federal money to foster energy efficiency and renewable
fuels also remains below the levels of a decade ago, they said.

<HEAD>West Germany's Largest Bank Announces Joint Venture in EGermany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Germany's largest commercial bank
announced plans Tuesday to set up a joint banking venture in East
Germany as the first Western institution to take a stake in the
former Communist nation.
   The joint venture by Deutsche Bank and East German partner,
Deutsche Kreditbank AG, would make it a leading financial force in
East Germany when the powerful West German mark becomes legal
tender in both German states this year.
   Deutsche Bank said in the announcement that Kreditbank, the
commercial banking arm of East Germany's central bank, will help
set up a branch network in East Germany.
   On April 1, East Germany introduced a Western-style commercial
banking system, but so far hasn't granted banking licenses to West
German or other foreign banks.
   Under Communist regime, the central Staatsbank had a monopoly on
all major financial transactions in East Germany, including
commercial and central bank activities.
   But last month, the Staatsbank spun off its commercial banking
activities into Deutsche Kreditbank, now temporarily owned by a
public trustee agency.
   The joint venture is a ``contribution to the establishment of an
efficient banking system in East Germany,'' Deutsche Bank said in
the statement. ``This is a precondition for a successful
restructuring of the East German economy.''
   No financial or other details were disclosed.

<TEXT>
   KARL-MARX-STADT, East Germany (AP) _ Like nearly every other
communist in East Germany, Karl Marx may get the boot too.
   Thirty-seven years after Chemnitz became Karl-Marx-Stadt by a
Communist government decree to honor the spiritual father of
Communism, city voters are getting the chance to switch the name
back again.
   Conceding to popular pressure for a referendum on the matter,
city officials earlier this month sent ballots to the 234,000
inhabitants over age 18.
   If a majority places a cross in front of Chemnitz on the ballot,
the city council will ask the newly elected democratic government
of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere to reverse the 1953 decision.
   The ballots, marked ``referendum town hall,'' must be returned
by Friday and will be publicly counted April 23. The final result
will be published three days later.
   Frank Werner Heine, one of the organizers of the popular
initiative, is confident about the outcome.
   He told the East German news agency ADN Tuesday the citizen's
movement had received overwhelming backing for a referendum when
the idea was floated last November shortly after a peaceful
revolution reversed four decades of Communist rule.
   ``In the following weeks we had 50,000 letters, the majority of
which were in favor of Chemnitz,'' he said.
   On May 5, 1953, the Communist Party Central Committee deleted
Chemnitz from the map.
   East German history books say the decision was in honor of the
``glorious traditions of the workers' movement and the achievements
of all workers in the city and region of Chemnitz.''

   A man bludgeoned his daughter with a tire
iron, then dismembered her body and boiled parts on the kitchen
stove, police said Tuesday.
   Police on Tuesday found the dismembered body of Carol
DiGregorio, 38, in the apartment she shared with her father, John
DiGregorio, 60.
   Some of her body parts had been skinned and boiled, and the head
was stuffed in the refrigerator in this town just northeast of
Philadelphia.
   District Attorney Alan Rubenstein called the Easter Sunday
slaying ``one of the most bizarre crimes anyone has ever
encountered. It was shocking.
   ``He methodically sliced the skin from her body,'' Rubenstein
said.
   DiGregorio was charged with murder and abuse of a corpse,
authorities said.
   Rubenstein said DiGregorio told authorities he bludgeoned his
daughter after she threatened him with a knife.
   The argument concerned a problem with the kitchen garbage
disposal and was one of a series of violent disputes between the
two in recent years, the Philadelphia Daily News quoted
unidentified investigators as saying.
   Police went to the apartment early Tuesday after receiving a
telephone call from DiGregorio's son-in-law, Daniel Bechurch of
Atco, N.J., who reported his wife's father told him about the
killing.
   Police said that when police arrived, DiGregorio told them,
``You're going to arrest me. I killed my daughter.''
   District Justice Catherine Ritter ordered DiGregorio held
without bail for a hearing next Tuesday.
   Rubenstein said DiGregorio told police he had struck his
daughter ``four or five times'' with a tire iron he'd been using to
fix the garbage disposal.
   After the woman fell on a couch, the district attorney said,
DiGregorio ``dragged her into the bathroom, cut off her clothing
and cut up her body, using a large knife and a hacksaw. Then he
cooked parts on the kitchen stove.''
   Rubenstein said the tools used to dismember the body were found
in the apartment, and that DiGregorio showed police where he'd
placed the body parts.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights groups are outraged over a
gun club's plan to hold a prairie dog shooting contest and award
prizes for the best shots on the critters that ranchers consider
serious pests.
   Marksmanship enthusiasts from Idaho, Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Wyoming and Colorado already are calling in for registration forms
for the July 14-15 event, billed as the ``Top Dog World
Championship Prairie Dog Shoot.''
   Teams killing the most prairie dogs at the greatest distances
will be eligible for top prizes, including imported hunting rifles
worth more than $1,300.
   Participation will be limited to 50 teams of two people each.
Each team will pay $100.
   Residents of the area in western Colorado complain that prairie
dogs multiply rapidly and create burrows in which cattle can break
their legs. They also damage irrigation systems in a state where
water is at a premium.
   Supporter Stan Austin said the event around the communities of
Nucla and Naturita will upset some people. But he said nearby Moab,
Utah, has its Jeep Weekend, Telluride has its Jazz Festival,
Durango has a bike race and local folks figured they needed to
offer something different to snare tourists.
   Fred Bellmire, a member of the Naturita town board, said he has
received a couple of complaints about the prairie dog shoot. But he
said the event would be good for the local tourism economy, which
now relies on hunters showing up during deer and elk season.
   ``The thought that tourists would find it amusing to see animals
killed is a pretty sick one,'' said Katharine Thalberg, director of
the Aspen Society for Animal Rights.
   ``We may be down to picket, I don't know,'' said Thalberg, who
led a recent campaign against animal furs in Aspen.
   Chris Bishop, of Prairie Dog Rescue Inc., called the event ``all
pretty sickening in my opinion.''
   Since August, he said, the group has moved 997 unwanted prairie
dogs from the Denver metropolitan area to places ``where they are
welcome, wanted and needed.''
   Bishop said prairie dogs are photographed by countless tourists
as they stand curiously atop their burrows and they are a main
component of the prairie ecosystem. They provide a food base for
endangered black-footed ferrets as well as badgers, eagles and
coyotes, Bishop said, and their abandoned burrows often provide
shelter to other animals.
   Mike Mehew, of the Ten Ring Gun Club which is sponsoring the
event, said there are too many prairie dogs to count and said if
they aren't shot during the competition, they'll be poisoned.
   Mehew said the carcasses of the animals will be left on the
prairie.
   ``I never ate one,'' Mehew said. ``We will just leave them.''

   Under the plan, about 5,800 homes and a number of schools and

buyouts or home-sale guarantees, airport officials said Monday.
   Final approval of the plan won't come until the Metropolitan
Airports Commission makes a final, more detailed proposal to the
FAA later this year, said Nigel Finney, a commission official.
   The commission hopes to begin insulating a few homes in the
summer of 1991, Finney said.
   Certain residents who have difficulty selling their homes
because of airport noise would be eligible for a federal buyout
option, or purchase agreement, under part of the program.
   If the commission were to buy a home that was not selling, it
would be insulated and returned to the market, Finney said.
   The FAA has determined that 18,544 people near the airport are
subjected to 24-hour noise levels that average 65 decibels or
higher.
   The commission, which began work on a noise compatibility study
in 1984, estimates that soundproofing and buyouts would cost $60
million to $70 million.
   Federal grants would pay for 80 percent, and the remaining 20
percent would be paid by Northwest Airlines, the airport's major
carrier, and other airport tenants, according to Finney.

<HEAD>Major Quake Strikes Area of Recent Ethnic Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale
on Tuesday struck China's far western border with the Soviet Union,
an area affected by ethnic unrest in recent weeks.
   The State Seismological Bureau said the quake hit West Wuqia in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region at 10:59 a.m. Tuesday, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
   The report said the bazaar city of Kashgar and surrounding areas
were affected, but details of damage were unknown. The Xinjiang
regional seismic bureau has sent seismologists to investigate, it
said.
   West Wuqia is just west of Kashgar, about 60 miles from the
Soviet border.
   The Richter scale gauges energy released by an earthquake as
measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude of
6.0 is considered a major quake.
   The area where the quake hit is between the Taklimakan Desert
and the Pamir mountains, which has peaks over 23,000 feet.
   Kashgar and other areas of southwest Xinjiang have been closed
to foreign travelers and journalists following reports earlier this
month of serious unrest involving Moslem ethnic groups.
   Unconfirmed reports say dozens of people have been killed.
   
   Local sources said troops were dispatched to Kashgar and two
other cities on April 6 to quell rioting linked to longstanding
strains between Chinese authorities and the Turkic-speaking Moslems
of Xinjiang.

<HEAD>Temblors Hits Southern California, Eastern Indiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aftershocks from February's earthquake shook a wide area of
Southern California Tuesday, and a small temblor hit rural, eastern
Indiana, but no damages or injuries were reported in either state.
   California residents from Los Angeles to the Mojave Desert felt
a 4.6-magnitude jolt at 3:32 p.m.
   Centered three miles west of Upland, the quake followed a trio
of minor earthquakes under the foothills of the San Gabriel
Mountains earlier in the day, scientists at the California
Institute of Technology said.
   ``It appears to be on the San Antonio Canyon fault,'' said Hall
Daily, a Caltech spokesman in Pasadena. ``What the seismologists
say is it seems to be extending the aftershock zone to the
southwest.''
   ``It was the usual rolling,'' said Gloria Kelley, a switchboard
operator for the city of Upland.
   Still, she added, ``I don't think you could ever get used to
this.''
   The tremors were aftershocks of the damaging magnitude-5.5
earthquake that rocked Southern California on Feb. 28, said Caltech
spokesman Robert Finn.
   The day's aftershocks began with a 3.4 temblor at 1:47 a.m.
centered six miles northwest of Upland. That was followed by a 3.3
quake at 7:12 a.m. and a 2.6 aftershock at 7:19 a.m., both three
miles west of Upland, Finn said.
   Two aftershocks measuring 3.4 and 2.4 occurred five miles
northwest of Upland early Monday. Upland is in western San
Bernardino County, 40 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The Feb. 28 earthquake caused an estimated $10.4 million in
damage, according to the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Indiana's Tuesday morning quake shook buildings, rattled windows
and woke up residents, but caused no damage, Jay County authorities
said.
   ``Usually an earthquake of this size is only felt over a small
area,'' said Michael Hamburger, seismologist and geology professor
at Indiana University.
   Seismology stations throughout the Midwest recorded the quake at
5:28 a.m., Hamburger said.
   He put the quake's magnitude at 2.5 to 3 on the Richter scale
and its epicenter in eastern Jay County, about 65 miles northeast
of Indianapolis.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable
damage.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Tuesday
he had asked for a full report on the arrest of a Mexican physician
accused of helping murder a U.S. drug agent in Mexico.
   Thornburgh said he asked the Drug Enforcement Administration to
file the report after learning Monday of news accounts that the
agency had offered a bounty in Mexico for the capture of the
physician, Humberto Alvarez Machain.
   DEA spokeman Frank Shults disputed those reports, including one
that the agency planned to pay a reward for the capture of Machain,
a Guadalajara gynecologist who was indicted Jan. 31 on federal
charges of participating in the 1985 murder of Enrique ``Kiki''
Camarena.
   NBC and Time Magazine both reported last weekend that Alvaraz
was captured by bounty hunters. Time also reported that DEA planned
to pay a bounty of more than $100,000 to the captors.
   ``There was no reward offered, period,'' Shults said. ``We don't
have bounties, the guy was arrested in El Paso on April 3rd and
arraigned on April 10th.''
   But Shults declined to describe the circumstances of Alvarez's
arrest.
   Thornburgh was asked about the case during a briefing of foreign
journalists the day before he is scheduled to go to Ixtapa, Mexico
for an Organization of American States three-day conference on
hemispheric drug enforcement.
   The attorney general said he couldn't comment on the reports
about Alvarez's arrest because he didn't know the facts.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel denied that
Thornburgh's request for the report was an indication that the
attorney general lacked confidence in DEA's handling of the matter.
``He just wants to get the facts,'' Runkel said.
   Mexican authorities are generally reluctant to extradite Mexican
nationals wanted by U.S. authorities.
   In a string of court rulings, including a recent Supreme Court
decision, federal judges have held that the kidnapping of U.S.
fugitives on foreign soil to bring them to justice does not violate
American law.
   Nothwithstanding those rulings, Shults said DEA does not offer
bounties for the kidnaping of fugitives.
   Charges against 18 people accused of participating in the
kidnaping or murder of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala
Avelar, have strained U.S.-Mexican relations.
   The Jan. 31 indictment returned in Los Angeles contained the
latest round of charges in the case. Besides Alvarez, it named
Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police, and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, former head of the
Mexican office of Interpol, the international law-enforcement
agency.

   A police SWAT team burst into a seaside hideout in
northern Italy Tuesday night and freed the 8-year-old daughter of a
leading sportswear manufacturer, ending a 78-day kidnapping ordeal
that touched all of Italy.
   Officials said Patrizia Tacchella was in good condition and was
being reunited with her parents in Verona. Three kidnappers were
arrested.
   Authorities said members of an elite police commando unit
stormed the kidnappers' villa in Santa Margherita Ligure, a small
town near Genoa on Italy's fashionable Ligurian coast.
   Interior Minister Antonio Gava said no shots were fired and no
one was injured.
   The girl's father, Imerio Tacchella, co-owner of the Carrera
jeans and sportswear firm, said no ransom was paid. News reports
have said the kidnappers demanded up to $16 million.
   Patrizia was abducted Jan. 29 as she walked by herself to a
supermarket near her Verona home to buy candy.
   Gava gave few details, but Italian news agencies said police
broke down the door and found the girl sitting in a chair, wearing
jeans and a red sweat shirt.
   Only one kidnapper was in the villa and he was arrested without
resisting, the reports said. The two other men showed up a short
time later and were apprehended. ANSA news agency said a gun was
found in the villa.
   ``At first Patrizia was frightened but she told us that when she
saw the uniforms she knew she had been saved,'' ANSA quoted one
commando as saying.
   An outpouring of sympathy for the family came from all over the
country following the abduction. The Verona bishop, Giuseppe Amari,
offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the girl. Pope John
Paul II sent a message of solidarity.
   The girl told investigators Tuesday night that she had been held
in the villa the past few days. It was not immediately known where
else the kidnappers kept her during the 11 weeks.
   After being taken to a nearby police station, Patrizia asked for
a soft drink and was given an Easter egg as a present. She spoke by
telephone with her mother.
   ``Patrizia said she was fine and didn't seem particularly scared
or upset,'' her father told reporters. ``She said she had seen me
on TV many times.''
   Italian media identified the three men arrested as being from
the Turin area, also in northern Italy.
   At least five Italians remain in the hands of kidnappers. The
latest victim, Rocco Surace, a 35-year-old storeowner, was abducted
in Calabria last Thursday.
   Patrizia's father appeared often on television to plead for his
daughter's release. A photo of the bespectacled Patrizia ran
regularly in newspapers and appeared on TV news programs.
   A popular program on missing persons, ``Chi L'Ha Visto?''
dedicated hours to her case, taking telephone calls from viewers
who thought they might have clues to her whereabouts.
   On Tuesday night, thousands of residents gathered outside the
Tacchella residence to welcome Patrizia home.
   ``What kept us going these 78 days were faith and hope,'' Imerio
Tacchella told reporters. ``The solidarity shown by people, the
postcards sent to the president, the banners in the stadiums and
all the other initiatives meant so much to us.''
   The SWAT team, officially called the Special Intervention Group,
was formed 10 years ago to deal with kidnappings, hijackings,
prison riots and terrorist-related cases. It is similar to Special
Weapons and Tactics police teams in the United States.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who created the
civil rights movement with Martin Luther King Jr. but decades later
enraged the slain leader's supporters by writing about his alleged
infidelity, died Tuesday.
   Abernathy, who had cradled the fallen King's bloodied head after
he was struck down by a bullet in 1968, was 64.
   Abernathy's heart stopped while he was being prepared for a lung
scan at Crawford Long Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Tisha
Burland.
   ``What they were trying to do was detect if there was a blood
clot in the lungs ... but they never got to see,'' Ms. Burland said.
   Abernathy was taken to an operating room, but he was pronounced
dead there at 12:10 p.m. before doctors could begin emergency life
support surgery, she said.
   Ms. Burland quoted Dr. Kenneth Scheidt, a nuclear medicine
specialist who was present for the scheduled lung scan, as saying
the test never began and could not have contributed to Abernathy's
death.
   Abernathy had been in the hospital since last month for
treatment of a sodium deficiency. He had suffered strokes in 1983
and 1986.
   Abernathy spent his last months under bitter criticism from his
colleagues for passages in his 1989 autobiography, ``And The Walls
Came Tumbling Down.'' He wrote that King had spent time with two
women and had a violent argument with one in the 24 hours before
his 1968 assassination.
   But the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who succeeded Abernathy as president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, described Abernathy
on Tuesday as ``a faithful servant of the cause of liberty and
justice.''
   ``I extend my love and support to his family,'' he said.
   ``I salute you Ralph (for) a life of great achievement and
merit,'' Coretta Scott King said in a statement from Harare,
Zimbabwe, where she was attending celebrations of that country's
10th anniversary of independence.
   ``When our home was bombed and our lives were threatened, he was
there,'' she said. ``His strength as a tactician and a counselor to
Martin during our struggle has been eloquently recorded in Martin's
own writings and in the annals of the American civil rights
movement.''
   King's son, Fulton County Commissioner Martin Luther King III,
called Abernathy's death ``a very tragic loss to our nation.''
   ``I know firsthand of the sacrifices he made for the civil
rights movement, and that should never be forgotten,'' said
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``His total life and passion was his support of Martin Luther
King,'' said former Mayor Andrew Young, another key King aide in
the movement. Young said that if Abernathy had a weakness, ``it was
trying to fill Martin Luther King Jr.'s shoes after his death, and
that was an impossible task.''
   State Sen. Arthur Langford, who visited Abernathy's family
Tuesday night, said the family would probably not make a statement
until Wednesday.
   Abernathy was pastor of Atlanta's West Hunter Street Baptist
Church and president emeritus of the SCLC, which he founded with
King in 1957 as a vehicle for the movement they began with the 1955
bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.
   Abernathy had said he had no desire to lead the movement,
preferring to leave that role to the more charismatic King. But two
days after King's assassination, the remaining aides picked him as
SCLC president, according to King's wishes.
   He was SCLC president for nine years, as the focus of the
movement shifted from voting rights and civil rights to economic
issues like employment and anti-poverty programs.
   He left the SCLC presidency in 1977, when he resigned to run for
Congress. He was defeated in the Democratic primary. In 1980, he
supported Ronald Reagan in his presidential bid.
   Abernathy suffered a stroke in 1983 and underwent brain bypass
surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. After he recovered,
he returned to preach at West Hunter, where he had been pastor
since 1961, and backed Jesse Jackson in his 1984 presidential bid.
   When Abernathy mentioned King's relationships with women in his
book, he became the first of King's inner circle to do so, even
though the matter had been chronicled by several noted biographers.
   Black leaders asked Abernathy to retract the passages, and
insinuated that his memory had been impaired by the strokes and
brain surgery. But Abernathy, whom King praised as his closest
friend and confidant, insisted the accounts were true.
   Abernathy, born March 11, 1926, in Linden, Ala., was King's
right-hand man for 13 years, sharing jail cells with him, traveling
with him and advising him.
   ``We were known as the civil rights twins,'' Abernathy once
recalled. ``We always sought to complement each other. I never
tried to be a copy of him and he never tried to be a copy of me.''
   It was Abernathy who comforted King as he lay dying of a bullet
wound on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., on
April 4, 1968. He took care of various funeral details for Mrs.
King, and delivered the eulogy.
   Although he worked helped found the civil rights movement, stood
at King's side through the great battles and went to jail as often
as King did, Abernathy consistently found himself in King's shadow.
   And it bothered him.
   In a 1986 interview, he lamented that once, when he visited a
school in Connecticut, ``not a single student knew who I was.''
   In his autobiography, Abernathy said he felt other King aides
saw him as ``no more than an appendage to Martin, someone who
served as a part companion, part bodyguard, but who never played an
important role in the decisions that affected the direction of the
movement.''
   The book uproar tore a hole in the already fragile relationship
Abernathy had with his movement colleagues, a relationship that had
been rather cool after Abernathy's endorsement of Reagan.
   At a 1985 dinner, he was praised by top black leaders as an
``unsung hero'' of the civil rights movement. Four years later, he
was handed a telegram, signed by most of his movement
contemporaries, that said the accounts about King in his
autobiography could ``rob you of your rightful place in history.''
   Hosea Williams, who also endorsed Reagan, branded his longtime
friend a ``Judas'' for writing about King's relationships with
women.
   Abernathy never took back his allegations. ``I'm not Judas,'' he
said. ``I know who I am.''
   Abernathy is survived by his wife, Juanita; two sons, Kwame and
state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy III; and two daughters, Juandalynn
and Donzaleigh.

<HEAD>NLRB Upheld In Refusing to Assume That Strikebreakers Are
Anti-Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Labor Relations Board does not
have to asssume that strikebreakers oppose union representation,
the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court overturned an appeals court in a
Texas case and upheld the board's policy of refusing to make a
presumption of anti-union views by strikebreakers.
   Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. was hit by a labor strike in
1979 by workers at its Houston warehouse after a contract expired
and the company locked out the 27 Teamsters union members who
worked there.
   Five of the 27 workers crossed the picket line when the strike
began. The company 12 days later hired 29 new employees to replace
the remaining 22 strikers.
   When the union later offered to end the strike under terms
previously offered by management, Curtin Matheson management
withdrew the offer along with its recognition of the Teamsters as
the employees' bargaining agent.
   The federal labor board in 1987 ruled that the company illegally
withdrew its union recognition. The board said the company acted
without adequate reason to believe the Teamsters lacked support
from a majority of the plant's workers.
   Upholding that position, and returning the case to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Thurgood Marshal wrote for the
majority Tuesday: ``Replacements may in some circumstances desire
union representation despite their willingness to cross the picket
line. ... In addition, a replacement, like a non-striker or a
strike crossover, may disagree with the purpose or strategy of the
particular strike and refuse to support that strike while still
wanting that union's representation at the bargaining table.''
   Joining Marshall were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White and John Paul Stevens.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.

<DATELINE>CORWIN SPRINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials said Tuesday they
will ask a judge to order a religious sect to halt construction on
a fallout shelter where more than 30,000 gallons of fuel has leaked
from buried tanks.
   David Niss, an attorney with the Department of Health and
Environmental Sciences, said after a meeting in Helena with Gov.
Stan Stephens and state regulators that the state will seek a court
order this week.
   The 31,000 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline leaked from three
of 35 buried tanks at the fallout shelter complex of the Church
Universal and Triumphant, a New Age religious sect that warns of
the possibility of imminent catastrophe.
   Niss said the court order would cover both the main shelter
complex at Corwin Springs, five miles north of Yellowstone National
Park, and about 45 smaller fallout shelters at the church-owned
subdivision of Glastonbury near Emigrant, Mont., about 20 miles to
the north.
   He said the state also will issue an emergency administrative
order requiring the church to empty, remove and inspect all 35
underground storage tanks at the Corwin Springs site.
   The order will direct the church to turn over all information on
how every storage tank on church property was installed, Niss said.
   ``We believe that we've done everything that we were asked by
the state to do, and we will continue to do it,'' said church
spokesman Murray Steinman. ``Our essential message is we're going
to cooperate, cooperate, cooperate.''
   Officials have said they believe the church's decision to bury
the tanks during the winter resulted in ruptures as the frozen
ground began to thaw and shift.
   The governor said he shared those concerns. ``If all tanks were
improperly installed in one area, it's a reasonable assumption that
the same method was used at other sites,'' Stephens said.
   The spill brought members of a U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency emergency response team from Denver and Helena to monitor
the cleanup at the church's headquarters on a mountain ranch on the
northern boundary of the nation's oldest national park.
   But state fisheries experts said Tuesday that Mol Heron Creek,
an important spawning area for Yellowstone cutthroat trout,
apparently has escaped long-term damage so far.
   Only a small amount of diesel fuel reached the stream last
Friday and since then no new traces have been found in the water,
said Glenn Phillips, pollution control biologist for the Department
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
   Phillips said the fuel didn't kill any fish but did wipe out
about 70 percent of the aquatic insects for about a quarter-mile
downstream. Insects upstream from the spill probably will soon
re-colonize the affected area, he said.
   The insects, including caddis and mayflies, are a critical food
source for both spawning trout and the resident fish population in
the creek that empties into the Yellowstone River, he explained.
   ``If we can keep more contaminants out of the stream, we can
probably save the fishery,'' said K.L. Cool, department director.
   The church installed the underground tanks for 634,500 gallons
of gasoline and diesel fuel as part of a 750-person fallout-shelter
complex it is completing at its Corwin Springs headquarters.
   Church officials said they're committed to cleaning up the
spilled fuel and will excavate and inspect all 35 tanks. Workers
were pumping out tanks and loading the fuel into trucks to be taken
as far away as Salt Lake City.
   Steinman said 146,500 gallons of fuel had been pumped from the
storage tanks as of Monday night, and an additional 40,000 was to
be removed by late Tuesday.
   ``No one wants a repeat of this situation,'' said Steinman.
``Everything that can be done is being done.''
   The group owns about 30,000 acres in southern Montana's Park
County. Local officials estimate 2,000 to 3,000 church members live
in the scenic mountain valley. The church said nobody is living in
the fallout shelters.
   State officials earlier this year reopened an environmental
review of church developments near Corwin Springs, saying the
church concealed construction of the shelter complex during the
original review a year ago.
   Reporters still have not been allowed by the church to view the
fallout shelter site or the spill cleanup.

<HEAD>Bullet Found in Greyhound Bus Radiator, Bomb Explodes at Depot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A small homemade bomb made of dry ice and water exploded
harmlessly Tuesday near the downtown Greyhound bus depot in
Redding, Calif., where a striking Greyhound driver was killed in a
bus accident March 3.
   In Kansas City, Mo., authorities were trying to determine when
and where a bullet found in a bus's radiator might have been fired,
a company official said.
   The bullet was discovered Monday afternoon after the bus arrived
in Kansas City from St. Louis. A security employee found the bullet
while inspecting the bus, said Claude Adams, Greyhound's area
general manager in Kansas City.
   ``You would have had to be looking for it to find it,'' Adams
said.
   He said the bullet entered the radiator at the rear of the bus
through a vent. The only external indication was a bent wire on the
vent screen.
   Greyhound has reported numerous incidents of violence since
6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenence and office workers went on
strike March 2 over wages and job security at America's only
nationwide bus company.
   The minor explosion in the northern California city of Redding
occurred at 1:22 a.m. on the far side of a maintenance building
from the depot, said police spokesman Bill Horton. The device,
fashioned from a plastic soda pop bottle, caused no injuries and no
visible damage to the concrete block exterior.
   The blast occurred when the mixture of water and dry ice inside
the bottle created pressure enough to shatter the container.
   A second identical homemade bomb that did not explode was found
nearby, authorities said. A bomb expert from the Shasta County
Sheriff's Department punched a hole in the bottle and released the
gas pressure building up inside.
   In the March 3 accident, 59-year-old Robert Waterhouse was
crushed when he was hit by a bus driven by a replacement driver.
Investigators ruled the death an accident.
   Police said they had no evidence linking the explosion to the
strike.
   Talks between the union and company have ceased and the company
says it will not resume talks until at least a week passes without
violence.

<HEAD>2 Canadian Jets Collide, Killing Pilot, Showering City With Debris</HEAD>

   Two Canadian fighter jets
collided over this southwestern German city during the early
evening rush hour Tuesday, killing one of the pilots and showering
sections of Karlsruhe with flaming debris, officials said.
   The second pilot suffered two broken heels after he ejected from
the single-seat F-18 and parachuted onto a busy highway, and at
least two people on the ground were also hurt, police and Canadian
authorities said.
   Officials earlier said the pilot landed on the highway in his
ejection seat, but police corrected that to say the pilot
parachuted after bailing out of the cockpit.
   Reports that the pilot was struck by a car on the A5 autobahn
proved inaccurate, officials said.
   Maj. John Paul Macdonald, spokesman for Canadian Forces in Lahr,
said the planes collided at about 9,800 feet while on a training
mission.
   Burning debris, ripped from the Canadian Air Force F-18s during
the collision, rained down on many Karlsruhe streets, with West
German television quoting witnesses as saying the engine of one jet
smashed into a building near a gas station.
   ``We were lucky it wasn't worse, because the crash occurred
during rush hour,'' police spokesman Manfred Frey said.
   West German television said the ejection-seat parachute of the
pilot who died apparently failed to open after the 4:10 p.m.
collision.
   The television reports showed badly damaged cars that had been
struck by aircraft debris while parked in Karlsruhe.
   ``Debris was spread across many kilometers (miles),'' said the
ZDF television network.
   The two wrecked aircraft crashed in areas that were sparsely
settled, setting off small brush fires, police said. Fire officials
and police rushed to extinguish the blazes.
   Chunks of an aircraft engine struck the ground in front of a
busy train station in this city of 285,000 residents, officials
said.
   ``Luckily, damage (on the ground) was minimal,'' said a police
spokesman.
   ZDF said there were initial reports of exploding ammunition at
the sites where the two planes came down. But Canadian air force
officials said there were no munitions on board the craft.
   Macdonald said the planes crashed south of Karlsruhe.
   In Canada, the father of the victim told Canadian Press that his
son, Capt. Timothy Kirk Leuty, 30, was nearing the end of his
3{-year stint in West Germany as a member of the 439th Squadron
based in Baden-Soellingen.
   ``We were really looking forward to his coming home,'' Stan
Leuty said from his home in Meaford, Ontario. ``He was due to leave
in June and he was going to be based in Cold Lake, Alberta, when he
got back.''
   The other pilot, Capt. Reginald deCoste, 35, of Jonquiere,
Quebec, ejected safely and landed on a highway, breaking both
heels. He was listed in good condition in an area hospital,
Macdonald said.
   Police identified the aircraft as American-made. They had taken
off from Baden-Soellingen Air Base near Rastatt, about 25 miles
southwest of Karlsruhe, police said. The Canadian Air Force has 48
F-18s at the base.
   Thousands of Canadian soldiers are stationed in West Germany as
part of a multinational NATO force. They routinely take part in
Allied military manuevers, including air training.
   The crash was bound to rekindle a debate over the dozens of
military training flights criss-crossing West Germany's skies each
day.
   The debate picked up steam after a series of deadly crashes in
1988. More recently, West Germans have said they would like to see
the training missions sharply curtailed as East-West relations
improve.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba and the Soviet Union signed agreements
Tuesday calling for an 8.7 percent increase in trade and no cuts in
Cuba's important sugar exports, the official news agency Prensa
Latina reported.
   Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City that
the agreements call for about $14.2 billion in trade this year
between the two nations. Previous trade figures were not given.
   A high-level Soviet delegation has been in Havana since Thursday
to negotiate the accords.
   Cuban Vice President Rafael Rodriguez told the official Cuban
news service that the agreements signify an ``advance and
consolidation of relations.''
   Some news reports have suggested the Soviets intended to impose
harsh conditions on Cuba, whose hard-line leadership is opposed to
economic and political reform.
   ``This campaign has dissipated like foam because the relations
maintained during these days confirm the friendship and the
unalterable principles that govern relations between the Soviet
Union and Cuba,'' Rodriguez was quoted as saying.
   The agreements signed by Rodriguez and Leonid Abalkin, Soviet
vice president and head of the delegation, cover energy, grain,
spare parts, food and prime materials, Prensa Latina said.
   Cuba will maintain the amounts of sugar, nickel and citrus fruit
that it sends to the Soviets and will also begin supplying them
with medicine and medical equipment, Prensa Latina said.
   The report did not specify quantities or prices.
   Cuba depends on the Soviet Union for 70 percent of its foreign
trade, investment in major industrial projects and other economic
help.
   In 1989, the Soviet Union bought more than half of Cuba's sugar
production, or 4.5 million tons, Prensa Latina has said. Other
purchases included nickel, cobalt and citrus that accounted for 40
percent of the Soviet supply.
   Cuba is a holdout to the economic and political reforms that
have been sweeping the Soviet bloc. As his allies in Eastern Europe
have fallen to reform-minded governments, Cuban President Fidel
Castro has steadfastly kept a hard-line position.

   The International Press Institute protested on
Tuesday to the Turkish government about its news coverage
restrictions on the Kurdish unrest in southeastern Turkey.
   Institute director Peter Galliner said he sent a message to
Turkish President Turgut Ozal urging his government ``to
immediately repeal this harsh legislation which effectively
abolishes press freedom in the region.''
   Turkish newspapers were banned last week from printing stories
or analyses that might harm military operations in the 11
southeastern provinces where Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting
for an independent Kurdistan.
   About 2,500 civilians, guerrillas and security forces have died
in the clashes tied to the drive for independence by the Kurdish
Labor Party, a Marxist group that has camps in neighboring Syria,
Iraq and Iran.
   According to the institute, the new regulations are targeted
against what authorities describe as publications that ``give
distorted information about activities in the region'' as well as
``false reports and comments'' about the Kurdish insurrection.
   The independent institute, with offices in London and Zurich,
claims representation of leading publishers and editors in more
than 60 countries.
   ``It is a gross violation of basic and internationally
recognized human rights and therefore can only do irreparable
damage to the reputation of Turkey throughout the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Medfly Spraying Ordered in California, One Fly Found in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   California's agriculture chief Tuesday ordered Medfly spraying
in a commercial agricultural region for the first time, and
officials in Florida plan to set traps after one of the
crop-destroying insects was found in a net.
   Southern California is seriously infested by the Mediterranean
fruit fly, and spraying is taking place over more than 400 square
miles of Los Angeles, Orange and now Riverside counties.
   On Monday, a third Medfly was found in San Bernardino County and
a male Medfly was discovered near Florida's Miami International
Airport.
   The Medfly in California raised particular concern because it
signaled the insect's first direct threat against a Southern
California commercial agricultural region.
   In addition to the pesticide spray order, state Food and
Agriculture Director Henry Voss filed a request for a previously
announced quarantine on crops grown over 84 square miles of
Riverside County.
   The quarantine, the first on commercial crops in this
infestation, would prohibit transportation out of the area of
fruits and vegetables that have not been fumigated against the
Medfly.
   Fumigated crops can be sold in the United States, but some
foreign countries, most notably Japan, won't buy treated fruits and
vegetables, said Larry Cooper, spokesman for the state Medfly
Project.
   ``The Mediterranean fruit fly is considered to be one of the
most serious agricultural pests in the world,'' said Richard Clark,
director of the Miami Medfly Project. ``It's known to attack over
250 different types of fruits and vegetables.''
   The last Medfly discovered in Florida was found in 1988. It
turned out to be the sole one found, Clark said.
   Workers plan to add about 1,700 traps to some 3,000 already in
Dade County. The traps will be checked daily for any of the pests,
Clark said.
   Eggs from the adult female Medfly hatch into larvae, which feed
on fruit and vegetables.
   The insect originated in Africa and spread to the South Pacific
and Central America, scientists say. It was discovered in Florida
in 1929 and has been eradicated from the state several times by
spraying infested areas.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge sided with an environmental group
in ruling that the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant violated
federal laws for a decade by storing residue from incinerated
plutonium-tainted waste without a permit.
   Government officials said the ruling shouldn't cause any
immediate changes at the plant or affect plans for Rocky Flats to
resume plutonium processing operations later this year.
   At issue in the Sierra Club's lawsuit was whether residue from
the burning of plutonium-tainted rags, trash and solvents required
a federal permit. U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock ruled that
it does.
   In the ruling issued last week and distributed by the Sierra
Club on Monday, Babcock said that since November 1980 the
Department of Energy ``has been obligated, but has failed'' to
apply for a key environmental permit for residue wastes at Rocky
Flats, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act prohibits the
treatment, storage or disposal of hazarous wastes without a permit
from the U.S. Environmental Agency or a state authorized to grant
the permit, Babcock said in the ruling.
   ``This takes a big step toward making clear what they can and
cannot store and what is and is not hazardous waste,'' said Maggie
Fox of the Sierra Club. ``They basically incinerated materials
under the guise of recycling when it was a waste-disposal
technique.''
   Babcock's ruling probably will have no effect on federal
decisions to resume plutonium operations at Rocky Flats, which has
been shut down for several months while the plant tries to meet
environmental and safety guidelines, said Department of Energy
spokeswoman Cathy Kaliniak.
   ``Right now, we are on track and proceeding through the
agreement we reached with the state,'' said Kaliniak.
   The Energy Department and the state signed an agreement on the
issue last November. The plant is operated by EG&amp;G Inc. for the
Energy Department, which took control of the plant away from
longtime plant operator Rockwell International Corp. last December.
   John Haggard, director of the Colorado Department of Health's
Rocky Flats program, said Tuesday the ruling will have little
effect on the state's regulation of the plant's waste disposal.
   Rocky Flats stores 1,250 cubic yards of radioactive residue at
the plant 16 miles northwest of Denver without a permit. Most of
the residue is from an incinerator used to burn the disputed waste,
which was shut down last August as a result of the lawsuit.
   Plant officials have argued for years that the residue was
exempt for environmental regulations because it was being stored to
recycle radioactive plutonium from the ash. But court records show
that plutonium actually was recovered from less than 10 percent of
the residue.
   The Sierra Club said the ruling means Rocky Flats now is storing
more radioactive waste than Colorado legally allows.
   State and federal officials had agreed Rocky Flats would store
no more than 1,601 cubic yards of waste consisting of plutonium
mixed with other hazardous substances such as industrial solvents.
Rocky Flats now has 1,094 cubic yards of the waste.
   Sierra Club attorney Adam Babich said Babcock's ruling means
mixed waste and the residue from burning are essentially the same
under the law. He said when the two waste sources are combined,
Rocky Flats has 2,344 cubic yards, far more than the
1,601-cubic-yard limit.
   But Fred Dowsett of the state health department said the two
wastes cannot be added together. He said the agreement the state
reached with the Energy Deparment last November calls for residue
wastes to be treated as a separate issue.
   Babcock said in his ruling that the DOE-state agreement was
``indefinite in many respects.'' He noted that the agreement allows
the DOE, not the state health department, to define which are
residue wastes.
   ``This may be an agreement to agree which is really no agreement
at all,'' Babcock wrote. ``Second, the deadlines are flexible.
Indeed, there is no deadline for compliance.''

   A former county councilman unseated
incumbent Mayor T. Patton Adams in a runoff Tuesday, gaining 57
percent of the vote.
   With all 50 precincts reporting, unofficial results showed
lawyer Bob Coble with 7,963 votes to 6,072 for Adams.
   The Richland County councilman and Adams were forced into a
runoff after both failed to receive more than 50 percent of the
vote in the April 3 non-partisian election.
   Coble was the top vote-getter of four candidates in that
election, receiving 6,122 votes, or 47.1 percent of the ballots
cast. Adams, mayor since 1986, got 5,411 votes, or 41.6 percent.
Two other candidates earned a total of 1,475 votes, or 11.3 percent.
   Adams and Coble spent about $250,000 campaigning for the
part-time, $17,000-a-year job as mayor of the state capital.
   Adams' campaign platform emphasized stablizing property taxes,
promoting growth, revitalizing decaying neighborhoods, expanding
the city's water and sewer system and developing a convention
center.
   Coble, who served as a Richland County councilman from 1985 to
1988, promised to devote more resources to neighborhood parks and
recreational programs and hire 70 more police officers in the next
five years.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity is holding its first congress
in nine years, but what should be a triumphant occasion comes at a
time when the once-outlawed trade union and its leader find their
popularity dropping.
   The union's second national congress, which opens Thursday, is
taking place amid the backdrop of the dramatic changes that have
swept away Communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe.
   The six-day congress is being held just a year after Solidarity
regained its legal status April 17, 1989, following months of
negotiations between the opposition and Poland's then-Communist
government. The union had been outlawed after the December 1981
imposition of martial law.
   The union now has friends throughout Eastern Europe, but its
popularity at home has apparently diminished because of harsh
austerity measures introduced by the new Solidarity-led government.
   A poll released Tuesday by the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza reflected a dramatic shift.
   Walesa's approval rating dropped from 90 percent in November to
56 percent in March, and support for Solidarity fell from 78
percent to 47 percent during the same period, according to the poll
taken by the government-run Opinion Research Center.
   ``In comparison to November, when the public mood was at its
highest, all those who owed their support to the general faith and
trust in Solidarity have lost some of it,'' Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   Walesa, the shipyard electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize
for his leadership of Solidarity, is expected to win re-election as
union chairman, although he is likely to face at least token
opposition in the voting Saturday.
   ``Walesa is an institution. As chairman of the union he
automatically strengthens its power and position,'' Lech Kaczynski,
a presidium member of the union's National Executive Commission,
told a news conference last week.
   A critical issue facing the delegates is whether the union
should largely confine itself to bread-and-butter issues defending
workers' interests, or get more involved in politics.
   One issue likely to emerge during the congress is whether to
create a Solidarity-linked political party.
   In an interview published Monday in the government newspaper
Rzeczpospolita, Walesa said his chief goal for Solidarity is
``turning it into a trade union'' and opening up the political
arena to other forces.
   Walesa said he wants to distance the union from the
Solidarity-backed government led by Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a former union journalist and adviser.
   The congress will provide the union's first opportunity to pass
collective judgment on the Mazowiecki government's economic reform
program. It includes austerity measures that are bringing
unemployment to workers in state-run industries. They are the same
people who created Solidarity during nationwide strikes in August
1980.
   The government has lifted price controls, cut subsidies to
industries and forced unprofitable factories to close as part of
its program to transform the centrally controlled socialist system
to a market-driven capitalist economy.
   While a recent government report shows the inflation rate
dropped from 78.6 percent for January to 4.7 percent for March.
Unemployment rose from 56,000 in January to 267,000 at the end of
March.
   Solidarity-backed candidates won overwhelmingly in June
parliamentary elections. That cleared the way for setting up the
East bloc's first non-Communist government in August.
   But as a trade union, Solidarity has lagged in signing up
members.
   The union has registered 2.2 million members since regaining its
legal status, or only about one-fifth of the 10-million membership
Solidarity claimed when it held its first congress in 1981.
   That first congress took place amid a barrage of hostile
propaganda from Poland's Communist authorities and the governments
of neighboring Soviet bloc countries.
   Solidarity at that time was the East bloc's only independent
trade union and was engaged in a struggle with the ruling Polish
Communist Party. The party was secretly gearing up for the
imposition of military rule two months later. Most of the delegates
spent Christmas in internment camps.
   When the 487 delegates assemble this time in the same Olivia
Sports Hall in the Baltic port of Gdansk, Solidarity's birthplace,
they will be joined by Mazowiecki and other government and
parliamentary leaders from the union's ranks.
   Also present will be independent trade unionists from other East
European countries that in the past year have also rejected
one-party Communist rule.
   Solidarity leaders say the congress represents the end of the
union's rebuilding phase.
   Delegates were chosen in local and regional union elections that
began last fall.
   Last week, Walesa indicated he planned to run for president of
Poland, but quickly retracted the statement.
   Referring Monday in Rzeczpospolita to complaints he is using the
union office as a stepping stone to the presidency, Walesa replied,
``It would be well if the president were to come from the bottom
and if he is with Solidarity in his heart.''
   But he added that he is not actively seeking the office.

<TEXT>
   A bottler has agreed to pay $67.5 million
to settle claims in the deaths of 15 students whose school bus was
knocked into a water-filled pit by a Coca-Cola truck last
September, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Under the agreement, Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc. would
pay each victims' family monthly payments for the rest of their
lives that would total $4.5 million, the McAllen Monitor said.
   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' the Monitor quoted an
unidentified attorney as saying. ``It's just a matter of taking
this before a court for approval and I don't see a problem with
that.''
   The accident occurred Sept. 21, 1989, in the south Texas town of
Alton. Twenty-one students died and 60 were injured when the truck
struck the bus. It was the state's worst school bus accident.
   Attorney Morris Atlas, who assisted in the negotiations,
declined to comment on reports of a settlement, the newspaper said.
Atlas did not return phone calls to The Associated Press.
   ``There's not anything I can talk about relating to any
negotiations,'' said Ramon Garcia, an attorney who represents the
families of three students who died and several of the injured.
   ``We have been negotiating for some time now,'' Garcia said.
   The soft-drink company agreed two months ago to pay $1.5 million
in a structured settlement with a family of one of the dead
students. It is the only wrongful death settlement in the case to
date.
   Cases filed on behalf of three of the injured students have been
settled for $250,000 each.

   Sony Corp. announced Tuesday it would invest
$300 million to renovate part of a mothballed Volkswagen assembly
plant to produce television picture tubes and, eventually,
high-definition TVs.
   The move, a major expansion aimed at bringing the Japanese
electronic giant's U.S. manufacturing capability closer to its
suppliers, comes at a time of increasing competition and friction
between the United States and foreign business.
   State and federal lawmakers praised the move as an opportunity
not only to bring more jobs to the semi-rural western Pennsylvania
area but also to help chip away at the huge U.S. trade deficit with
Japan.
   Masaaki Morita, chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said the
lease from the state of the 600-acre parcel 45 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh was ``one of the largest single investments that Sony
has made in a factory'' and ``a major investment in Sony's future,
with impact beyond the region and the U.S. market.''
   Weak sales forced the closing of the Volkswagen of America Inc.
plant in July 1988.
   The shutdown caused layoffs of about 2,500 workers and hard
feelings among state and local officials who arranged a $70 million
loan to the West German automaker for completing the facility and
related roads and railways. At its peak in 1980, the plant employed
5,700 people.
   To take over the sprawling factory, the state is forgiving $40
million still owed by VW from a $70 million loan taken from the
state in 1976 to complete a partially built Chrysler Corp. plant,
train workers and build a railroad spur and highway, Gov. Robert P.
Casey said.
   Sony estimates about 1,000 jobs, mainly in higher-skilled fields
such as engineering, will be created over the next three years by
its sixth U.S. plant.
   Morita said Sony, which already has a picture-tube plant in San
Diego, decided to locate in Pennsylvania to be closer to key
suppliers and markets in the central and eastern United States.
   ``We believe we must make the product in the market where we
sell it,'' he said. ``Sony's TV business in the United States is
growing while at the same time the market trend is toward larger
and larger screen sizes.''
   Other recent U.S. manufacturing ventures by Sony include the
acquisition of a semiconductor chip production plant in San Antonio
from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the production of laser video
discs through an Indiana-based subsidiary.
   Sony hopes to begin producing 32-inch TV tubes by the end of
1992 for domestic and export sales. It aims to manufacture about 1
million tubes within the first year of production and 1.5 million
in the next two years, officials said.
   High-definition television sets, which feature exceptionally
clear pictures, also will be made at the plant after the U.S.
government formulates HDTV standards in 1993, said Kunitake Ando,
president of Sony Engineering and Manufacturing of America.
   Pennsylvania agreed to provide Sony with $23.5 million in
low-interest loans and job-training grants to develop half of the
1,200-acre site.
   The company also plans to lease two additional parcels of 200
acres each for the possible development of an additional plant
within the next five years. Sony also can sublease the sites to
companies such as glass and cabinet makers involved in the
production of other television components.
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz III, R-Pa., said Sony's decision to locate
in Pennsylvania advances efforts to reduce trade friction between
the United States and Japan.
   He said he promised Morita's brother, Akio, Sony's chairman and

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>

   Authorities on Tuesday arrested the reputed
ringleader and most of the 18 suspected members of a drug ring that
smuggled heroin from Nigeria into Baltimore, officials said.
   The raids in Baltimore, Washington, Rome and Sao Paulo, Brazil,
capped a yearlong investigation, the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration said in a statement.
   More than 200 federal, state and local drug agents arrested
suspects named in 18 federal indictments unsealed earlier in the
day, the DEA said.
   Most of the 18 suspects were under arrest by mid-afternoon,
including reputed ringleader Linwood R. ``Rudy'' Williams, 36, who
was arrested at his Baltimore home, the agency said.
   Other suspects included Williams' brother, Jackie Glen Williams;
his nephew, Namond Earl Williams; and his cousin, Gerald Bernard
Gray.
   All were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin and
cocaine.
   Agents seized $250,000 in cash, one kilo of nearly pure heroin
valued at $150,000 and another of cocaine valued at $25,000. Also
seized were several vehicles, including a 1984 Ferrari, a Jaguar
and four Mercedes Benz automobiles.
   Agents also confiscated two rifles, nine handguns, antique
silver and other jewelry, a fur coat and drug paraphernalia.
   The heroin originated in Nigeria and was shipped through various
foreign cities to New York, where it was then transported to
Baltimore, a DEA spokesman said.
   The operation may have brought 110 pounds of heroin, or about
20,000 street doses, into Baltimore in the past year, authorities
said.
   Officers from the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and the IRS took part in the raids, executing 27 search
warrants, DEA spokesman Mario Perez said.
   The Williams group allegedly began in April 1989 and operated
throughout Baltimore, the spokesman said.
   Williams was aquitted last year on charges of heroin possession,
assault and resisting arrest.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in a racial attack case on Tuesday
watched a 42-second television interview in which the alleged
ringleader of a white gang says the mob assembled to protect their
turf.
   In the videotape broadcast on WABC-TV five days after the Aug.
23 killing of Yusuf Hawkins, Keith Mondello said the whites
gathered to battle a gang of blacks they believed were coming
looking for trouble in their mostly white Brooklyn neighborhood.
   ``I was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my
friends up,'' Mondello said. ``The only reason baseball bats were
on the scene was because we wanted to protect ourselves. And we
didn't know if they were going to be armed.''
   Mondello denied knowing that one of the whites was carrying a
gun and said the attack was not racially motivated.
   ``No matter what color they were, if someone was coming to beat
my friends up we would do anything to protect ourselves,'' Mondello
said.
   Prosecutors said they played the taped interview to show the
19-year-old defendant was a liar who had changed his account of the
attack.
   ``I don't buy that wide-eyed innocence that's on the tape,''
Paul Burns, an assistant district attorney, said outside the
courtroom. ``Take a look at what he said to the police and what he
said on the tape.''
   After his arrest, Mondello told investigators that before the
attack a man identified only as ``Frank'' put an object in his car
that Mondello soon learned was a gun.
   ``I opened the door and saw it was a gun that he put in my
car,'' Mondello told detectives. ``I picked it up and gave it back
to him. We all then went to the schoolyard.''
   A few minutes after they went to the schoolyard, ``Joey Fama
yelled from the corner, `They're here, black kids are here,'''
Mondello told the investigators.
   The whites surrounded Hawkins and his three friends, all black.
Within seconds, prosecutors say, Fama stepped from the mob and
fired four shots, hitting Hawkins in the chest.
   Mondello and Fama are charged with second-degree murder and
other crimes. If convicted, they face 25 years to life in prison.
   Two juries were impaneled to hear the trials of the two men, one
for Mondello and one for Fama.
   Opening arguments in the Fama's trial were postponed a second
day because his defense lawyer, David DePetris, was ill with the
flu.

   Cuba, escalating its resistance to U.S.
government-sponsored broadcasting, jammed Radio Marti early Tuesday
for the first time since TV Marti went on the air.
   Cuba continued to jam the late-night test signal of TV Marti,
which began broadcasting March 27.
   ``We're pretty sure they jammed (Radio Marti) just during the
time TV Marti was on the air,'' said Antonio Navarro, acting
director of both services for the Voice of America.
   In a communique monitored in Miami, Cuba denounced Radio Marti
as ``an instrument of psychological war and disinformation'' aimed
at overthrowing Fidel Castro's regime, according to a story
published in Wednesday's Miami Herald.
   The Cuban government has said that TV Marti, its signal sent
from an antenna aboard a balloon off the south Florida coast,
constitutes an aggressive action and violates Cuban sovereignty.
   In a speech earlier this month, Castro implied that one of the
moves under consideration in retaliation to the TV Marti broadcasts
would involve Radio Marti. He also has threatened to retaliate by
interfering with American broadcast signals in Florida.
   Radio Marti, which sends news and entertainment to Cuban
listeners, has been broadcasting relatively free of interference
since going on the air in 1985.
   Both the radio and television stations are named after 19th
century Cuban independence hero Jose Marti.

   A solid majority of Brazilians
support the government's crash economic plan, which has brought
inflation down from a record 5,000 percent but also cost hundreds
of thousands of people their jobs.
   ``I couldn't go on the way it was before. With inflation down,
I've got at least a little bit of money in my pocket,'' said
Denilson Goncalves, who sells baked goods on the street of a
middle-class neighborhood in Rio.
   Goncalves' views were reflected in a public opinion poll
conducted last week in Brazil's 10 largest cities that indicated 71
percent approval. Conducted by the prominent Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper, it surveyed 5,291 people and had a 2 percent margin of
error.
   But support for the plan has dropped 10 percent from a similar
survey conducted three weeks ago, reflecting a growing concern over
a rapid rise in unemployment.

   Homeowners' gardens and yards in the Gold
Rush town of Skagway will be vacuumed this month in a high-tech
spring cleaning aimed at removing lead from the soil.
   The work, which starts this week, is the final step in one of
Alaska's most expensive pollution cleanups.
   Extremely high levels of lead were discovered in 1988 in the
soil in Skagway, a shipping port for lead and zinc ore for decades.
But fears that the 700 residents were threatened by lead poisoning
were eased by the results of blood tests conducted by the state.
   State health officials concluded the lead posed no significant
threat. Blood lead levels in virtually all the residents tested
were below average. Officials explained that Skagway's lead is in a
raw form, which is not as easily absorbed into the body as
processed lead.

   Two of Washington's most famous landmarks, the
Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, are slowly crumbling under the
ravaging effects of water seepage, air pollution, littering
tourists and a pesky little bug called the midge, experts say.
   Private consultants hired by the National Park Service say the
most glaring problem was found at the 68-year-old Lincoln Memorial,
where dripping rainwater has caused deterioration of huge concrete
slabs that support a broad cobblestone walkway and the grassy
terrace surrounding the building.
   At the Jefferson Memorial, completed in 1943, cracks have been
detected in the concrete shell of the inner dome. Officials also
are worried that the main plaza and marble steps may be sliding
gradually into the waters of the Tidal Basin.
   The Park Service said none of the problems is serious enough to
require immediate attention or pose a safety hazard to visitors.

   President Bush warned Tuesday of ``appropriate

superpower relations.
   ``I want to be sure anything we do is productive,'' Bush said.
``There's been dramatic change in the world and I don't want to
inadvertently take some action that would set it back.''
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., were invited to the White House

   Lawmakers have warned that Congress might act on its own with
economic pressure against Moscow if the Soviets escalate efforts to

   That was only the beginning for the new dominant force in city

experimental economic zone where the free market reigns and foreign
cash flows freely.
   ``We'll be trying to bring in a program of the privatization of

   Consumer prices, fueled by sharp increases in
clothing, housing and medical costs, shot up 0.5 percent in March
to push inflation to the highest level since 1982, the government
said Tuesday.
   Private economists saw the unexpectedly brisk advance in the
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index as a discouraging sign that
inflation was not retreating as they had hoped.
   The inflation rate is ``dangerous and potentially devastating
for financial markets and the economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   Through the first three months of the year, inflation has risen
at an annual rate of 8.5 percent, the fastest quarterly increase
since a 10.1 percent increase in the spring of 1982.

   Experts are almost evenly divided about
whether the federal government is taking too much money away from
cancer, heart disease and other medical studies to support AIDS
research, according to a survey by the Office of Technology
Assessment.
   The OTA survey, released Tuesday, said most of the experts also
believe AIDS research ``has made many important contributions to
advances in the biomedical and behavioral sciences'' and that
virtually every medical speciality has benefited, to some degree,
from money spent on AIDS studies.
   Federal spending for treatment and prevention of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome totals about $2.9 billion for the fiscal year
that ends this October. Research into the human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS, is about $1.16 billion.
   ``Critics of rising expenditures on HIV disease point out that
HIV funding has exceeded funding for heart disease and rivals
funding for cancer, despite the much greater number of deaths from
these latter diseases,'' the OTA report said. It said about 10
percent of the total National Institutes of Health 1990 budget goes
to HIV funding.

   Researchers say they have pinpointed for the
first time a gene that may make people prone to alcoholism, adding
weight to the argument that alcoholism is a disease and not a moral
weakness.
   Government scientists called the finding ``provocative and
promising,'' even if it requires more study, but a leading
investigator in the field declared it was impossible to say an
``alcohol gene'' had been identified.
   The researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association that they found a particular gene on a
chromosome previously linked with alcoholism to be far more common
in alcoholics than in non-alcoholics. If verified, the finding
would represent the first specific identification of a genetic root
for alcoholism.
   Alcoholism, which afflicts an estimated 18 million Americans,
tends to run in families, and previous studies of families and of
adopted twins have suggested that environment and genetic factors
contribute to the disorder.

   Franklin died in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. In

city of Boston, and an equal sum to the state of Pennsylvania and
the city of Philadelphia. The dollar did not become the official

   The money came from what Franklin earned during his tenure as

<HEAD>Serial Killer Film Finally Reaching Theaters After Tortuous
Journey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John McNaughton calls his film ``Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer'' a ``cautionary tale.'' But the
Ratings Board said caution wasn't enough and gave it an X-rating.
   Now ``Serial Killer'' is reaching a few of the country's movie
screens after a tortuous five-year journey. Because of the
X-rating, which means moviegoers under 17 can not be admitted, only
a handful of theaters will exhibit the film and few newspapers will
accept ads. Yet the film has earned decent reviews for mainstream
critics.
   John McNaughton, 50, is a quiet-spoken Chicago filmmaker who
left his ad agency business to tour with a carnival, then returned
to pursue his longtime interest in video and film. He was making
commercials when he was approached by Waleed and Malik Ali to make
a horror film for their MPI Home Video.
   McNaughton readily agreed. As he was searching for a subject, he
met his friend Richard Fire, a Chicago playwright. ``Here, look at
this,'' said Fire, playing the tape of an interview on ABC's
``20@20'' with Texas mass murderer Henry Lee Lucas.
   ``It took about 30 seconds for it to sink in: `My God, this is
true deep horror that this guy could go out and do those things.'
One of the things that got through to me was that Henry had this
low-key charm in the way he talked. He had the ability to be
charming in his own strange way and had the ability to get close
enough to people to slaughter them,'' McNaughton said.
   Fire and McNaughton wrote the script, closely following the
Lucas case. For the vital role of the murderer, the director chose
Michael Rooker, an outgoing family man who was painting houses
while hunting for acting jobs. He has since appeared in ``Eight Men
Out,'' ``Mississippi Burning'' and ``Music Box.''
   ``Henry'' was filmed in Chicago during a four-week period in
late 1985. The budget: $100,000.
   ``The original intent of the film was for home-video release
only,'' says McNaughton. ``Those of us on the film were keeping our
fingers crossed that it would turn out well enough to get a
theatrical release.''
   The Ali brothers sent the film to a number of distributors. No
interest. McNaughton began his own campaign, showing it in 1986 at
the Chicago Film Festival where it stirred good comment. Vestron
Co. people saw the film at a New York screening and made an offer.
   ``Vestron was very healthy at the time, and they were ready to
send it to theaters and home video,'' says McNaughton. But the
company's lawyers became skittish about the depiction of real-life
figures, and the deal evaporated.
   Meanwhile, McNaughton was hired to direct ``The Borrower'' for
Atlantic Releasing, which also took on ``Henry'' in late 1987.
   ``Then the MPAA gave it an X-rating, and Atlantic walked away
from the deal,'' he said. ``I think Atlantic was going to take it
into 400 to 600 theaters. The marketability because of the X-rating
is cut down to maybe 25 to 30 theaters, maybe one art-house per
city. So it becomes commercially unviable for a company like
Atlantic.''
   The objection of the Ratings Board of the Motion Picture
Association was to the excessive violence. McNaughton could see no
way to make cuts in an already tightly edited film.
   ``Often a film is like a house of cards: pull out one and the
house collapses,'' he said.
   ``Henry'' reverted to MPI, where a marketer became enthused and
lined up screenings with film societies and film festivals. The
glowing reviews attracted a small distributor, Filmcat, based in
Las Vegas. McNaughton has been on the road to attract attention to
his movie, since films and TV ads are unavailable.
   While in Los Angeles, he has been talking to major companies
about future projects.
   ``We'll see what happens,'' he said cautiously. ``Under the
concept of `heat' as it's practiced in this town, I should have a
month or so of heat. I hope it develops into paying work, which is
what I sorely need at this moment.''

<HEAD>Terrorizing Homeowners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to legend and song, home used to be
sweet, and it still can be if you are able to withstand the
pressure. It's constant.
   The latest terrorizer of the homeowner, and of renters too, is
the telemarketer, often a bank or an insurance agent, who believes
the dinner hour is the time to make a telephone sales pitch.
   The audacity of such sales people is magnified many times when
you consider how difficult it is to sell anything to someone who
left a plate of roast beef or chicken on the table and who probably
still has some in the mouth.
   They try, however, and presumably they occasionally succeed, due
to the law of numbers. But they can create havoc in the home,
befouling the ideal of it being a place of rest, relaxation,
security, peace and love.
   By the million and one standards of insurers, there is no home
or person in America adequately insured for accident, ill health,
life, property. By brokerage-house standards, none is properly
invested in stocks either.
   While you might find yourself adequately prepared to ward off
the pitches, they leave you with doubts, the nagging kind, the
guilty kind that erode your resistance and set you up for an
eventual collapse and purchase.
   While telemarketers are occasional interruptions, there are
constant ones too. Rarely is the homeowner safely guarded against
hearing or reading about rising interest rates, collapsing home
prices and forced sales.
   You might say that alleged studies supporting such contentions
are a staple of some academics, that they sometimes come from Wall
Street analysts who might understand stocks but not houses, and
that they always find a media outlet.
   Many of them are poorly done, including one by a Harvard
University professor and his assistant, who forecast a long, steady
decline in prices of existing homes, but whose methodology has been
demonstrated as naive.
   Why is the homeowner the focus of so much attention? Because
homeowners have money and worries. Money can buy the goods, and
worry about protecting the house can be a very good sales opener.
   There is no limit to the problems that can be created and the
solutions offered.
   You found a leak. You say it's insignificant? No leak is
insignificant. Slowly and without letup it is doing damage inside
your wall, unseen until it suddenly erupts in a cascade of
destruction. Plumbers will tell you so.
   Maybe, you think, you should fill up the fuel oil tank you
buried in the backyard. Prices might be lower in summer. You said
buried? Is it metal? How do you know its not rusting? And befouling
your well?
   Better check the well. If you live in the city, better check
your water anyway. Sure, you might find strange chemicals there,
but they can be taken care of reasonably, give or take a few
hundred dollars.
   There is no retreat from these problems. They must be faced,
even if you think you can hide from them.
   You might go out on the lawn, pictured on grass seed boxes as a
serene place, but you know you will find work to be done. Besides,
have you considered all the chemical you've dumped on that lawn?
And that more and more rashes and respiratory problems are being
reported? And that you could get Lyme Disease?
   You may try retreating to the cellar, but you've heard there
could be radon gas there. The attic? What if you find termites at
home? Wouldn't it be better if you just didn't know?
   You could, if you wish, climb to the roof and meditate. Nobody
is likely to bother you there, except perhaps a neighbor who calls
the authorities. Aside from that, how do you know it's safe up
there?
   The reason for the question is that there's that fire-retardant
plywood, you know, that some builders used on roofs, and the word
is that some of it deteriorates and crumbles under the least
pressure.
   How can you be sure it won't just dump you down into the living
room, amid all those other problems?
   Home _ what a terrifying place.

<HEAD>Crime Increasing in Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two thieves shot Yeh Yung-chuan to death,
in front of other investors, as he left the trading floor of a
brokerage house with nearly $100,000. Crime has come to Taiwan on
the heels of affluence.
   Yeh, a 32-year-old accountant, turned to run when the men
stopped him. They shot him once in the back and once in the head,
took his 2.5 million Taiwan dollars and fled on a motorcycle parked
outside.
   Such brutal crimes are becoming common. Wealthy businessmen hire
guards and use bulletproof cars.
   ``Taiwan is not safe anymore,'' said Rebecca Yen, a 28-year-old
employee of a trading company. ``Most of my friends plan to
emo Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
   Tai estimated that about 40,000 Taiwanese left in 1989, up from
30,000 in 1988.
   Luxury cars, seen as invitations to kidnapping and robbery, no
longer are in demand.
   Eric Fang, assistant sales manager of the largest Mercedes-Benz
agency, said his company sold only 290 cars in December, down from
the 1988 monthly average of 650, and predicted a drop in sales of
15 percent for 1990.
   ``Many businessmen have postponed purchases because they do not
want to drive the `dangerous cars','' he said.
   Authorities report a dramatic increase in smuggled guns from
China. Police said they seized 687 Chinese-made shotguns last year,
up from 57 in 1988.
   Official statistics say smuggled Chinese guns were used in 91
killings in 1987, including those of four policemen.
   Premier Lee Huan has proclaimed 1990 ``Anti-Crime Year'' and
proposed that gun possession, now punishable by 10 years in prison,
be made a capital crime.
   Thousands of inexpensive guns are believed to be in the hands of
gangsters. Some legislators say the only way to stop the influx
from the mainland is for the government to hold direct talks with
Beijing.
   The ruling Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the Communists, and still refuse to negotiate directly
with the Beijing government.
   Lin Chia-cheng, a sociology professor at Soochow University,
believes one reason for the crime wave is ``the widened gap between
the rich and the poor.''
   Taiwan's export-led economic boom has made its per capita gross
national product the fourth highest in Asia, but good fortune has
not been shared equally. The income of the top 20 percent is nearly
five times that of the bottom 20 percent.
   People also seem more inclined to seek quick riches than to work
for a better life. Stock speculation has been the favored tactic,
but many have turned to crime.
   ``Traditional values have faded,'' Lin said. ``Fewer people
believe in hard work and saving. Most envy those who have gotten
wealthy fast from speculating, and some think it is all right to
get money from those rich people.''

<HEAD>Latin American Banks: Great Rewards, Great Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Latin American banks pay high
returns, but the risks are just as great. Money doubled every month
in Brazil _ until March, when the government froze all accounts.
   Such uncertainty is one reason Latin Americans are believed to
have more than $200 billion in Switzerland, the Bahamas, Miami and
elsewhere.
   Latin leaders are encouraging citizens to bring their money
home, but bitter memories and recent government actions bode ill
for success.
   On his first day in office last month, President Fernando Collor
de Mello of Brazil put an 18-month freeze on $115 billion in
personal and corporate checking, savings and money market accounts
and bank certificates of deposit.
   He said the drastic ``liquidity reduction'' was needed to halt
annual inflation of 4,853 percent in Latin America's largest
country.
   Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Peru and Chile have decreed economic
plans that disrupted the lives of ordinary savers and, for the most
part, frustrated government efforts to persuade citizens to invest
in their own countries.
   Brazil's policy allows withdrawls of up to $1,200 from checking
and savings accounts and $600 or 20 percent of the balance,
whichever is greater, for money-market accounts, mutual funds and
CDs.
   Collor de Mello said he was after ``big speculators,'' but
millions of middle class Brazilians saw their plans for new cars or
down payments on homes suddenly canceled.
   ``There's no doubt that the measures seriously affected people's
confidence in the local savings and banking system,'' said
consultant Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a former Central Bank president.
   ``They furthered the belief that, for Latin Americans, the only
real financial protection is the U.S. dollar or some other strong
currency,'' he said in an interview.
   ``On the other hand, Brazil could not go on with four-digit
inflation. If the new economic plan meets with total success, maybe
it will erase the trauma.''
   Clarice Pechman, a leading expert on foreign exchange, estimates
Brazilians have more than $40 billion outside the country.
   Brazilians, traditionally easygoing, have tried to make the best
of things. Jokes have sprung up, as they often do in tough times.
   When an alligator was discovered in a pond at the Quinta da Boa
Vista park in Rio, residents named it Zelia because of its ``big
bite.'' The economy minister, who announced the freezing of
accounts, is Zelia Cardoso de Mello, no relation to the president.
   The government said the restrictions applied only to new
cruzados, the money that existed before Mar. 16. It promised
nothing would happen to cruzeiros, the currency introduced on that
date, and urged people to open cruzeiro accounts.
   A branch manager of Bradesco, a large private bank, said: ``Are
you kidding? All people want to do is take their money out.'' He
asked that his name not be used.
   In Argentina, the government seized about $1.5 billion worth of
seven-day, high-interest bank CDs in January and converted them to
10-year government bonds.
   Argentines who don't want to wait until 2000 to get their money
back can sell the bonds for cash, but they get only about 30
percent of the face value.
   ``They robbed me,'' said Raul Tucci, who owns a small Buenos
Aires furniture factory. He was in line at his bank, which offered
free cups of coffee to its angry customers.
   ``I owe money for wood I bought, Tucci said. ``I can't pay it. I
have to close the factory and lay off my 50 workers. Who wants
coffee? I want my money.''
   Pedro Gianbaggi, a businessman, said: ``Never again will I put
my money in a bank.'' He was allowed to withdraw only 1 million
australs, about $500, from his blocked certificates of deposit.
   Lucia Lattuada said the government bonds were ``good only for
papering the wall.''
   In 1982, Mexico forcibly converted about $10 billion in U.S.
dollar accounts to pesos, then devalued the peso by 30 percent.
``It was horrible,'' said Donna Rojinsky, a U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman.
   Many Mexicans decided it wasn't safe to keep their money at
home. Those near the border opened accounts on the American side or
invested in Texas real estate.
   Unofficial estimates say Mexicans have $100 billion outside the
country, but up to $3.5 billion is said to have returned since
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a free-marketeer, took office
in December 1988. Peso bank accounts now pay interest of 20 percent
a year, higher than the inflation rate.
   Bolivia converted dollar accounts to bolivianos, the local
currency, in the 1980s and claimed no one lost anything.
   That argument was based on the official exchange rate, but
bolivianos officially worth a dollar brought only 10 cents on the
street. Bolivian private savings, too, went abroad.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru ordered $900 million in dollar
accounts converted to Peruvian soles in 1985 and the money quickly
lost value to inflation, which reached four digits by 1987. Small
depositors suffered most, because the rich had taken their money
out of the country.
   After the Chilean military coup of 1973, Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
government limited withdrawals from savings accounts to $200, but
the restriction lasted only two years. Inflation declined and
people were allowed to get their money back.
   Uruguay, which permits foreigners to hold dollar accounts, is an
exception to the general rule of banking uncertainty.
   Of the estimated $60 billion in Argentine funds held outside the
country, about $2 billion is thought to be in neighboring Uruguay.
Residents of Buenos Aires can visit their money by taking a
30-minute flight or a slightly longer hovercraft ride.
   Antonio Erman Gonzalez, Argentina's economy minister, said at an
April meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank: ``If domestic
savings go abroad, it makes it more difficult for Latin American
countries to attract foreign investment. The foreigners see the
locals taking all their money out of the country.''
   Inconsistent government policy has been a major factor in
creating the distrust.
   Under former President Jose Sarney, Brazil allowed private banks
to offer numbered, or ``bearer,'' money market accounts.
   Those accounts invested heavily in Treasury bills and notes, in
part financing the government's inflationary spending. The idea was
that nameless, high-interest accounts would be an alternative to
keeping money in Switzerland or elsewhere.
   Hours after taking office in March, Collor de Mello outlawed all
bearer accounts.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physical and emotional scars persist six
months after the killer earthquake jolted the San Francisco Bay
area, but most businesses and residents are back on solid ground.
   Economic activity has nearly regained its pre-quake level,
analysts say, and estimates of the cost of damage caused by the
massive temblor have been scaled back.
   The damage is widespread, nevertheless. The elevated section of
Interstate 880 in Oakland, where 42 people died when the road
collapsed Oct. 17, has been dismantled while discussions continue
about whether to rebuild or reroute it.
   The similarly elevated Embarcadero Freeway stands forlorn near
downtown San Francisco while politicians and business people debate
whether it should be replaced or rebuilt.
   Two sections of busy Highway 101 in San Francisco are under
repair, intensifying rush-hour traffic jams, and some small
businesses in hard-hit Oakland, Los Gatos, Santa Cruz and
Watsonville are still awaiting federal loans for reconstruction and
inventory replacement.
   In downtown Oakland, where many empty buildings are surrounded
by chain-link fences, the Emporium department store isn't expected
to reopen until August. The store suffered more than $10 million in
damage when display windows shattered, stairwells collapsed and the
exterior brick facade cracked.
   Small tremors, shrugged off or barely noticed by the Bay area's
six million residents before the 7.1 magnitude quake last fall, now
trigger memories of the tragedy that claimed 68 lives and worries
about the really big one that geologists say is bound to come.
   But the region's economy, on the whole, has rebounded vigorously
with no evidence of long-term damage.
   From the computer and chip companies in Silicon Valley to the
retail and financial giants in San Francisco, the Bay area remains
one of the most vibrant centers of economic activity in the country.
   Retail business in San Francisco is now about 96 percent of
normal, said Deputy Mayor James Ho. That's despite the fact that
some hard-hit sections _ Chinatown, North Beach, South of Market,
Fisherman's Wharf and the Mission _ continue to suffer. Business in
those areas is down from 8 to 18 percent, Ho said.
   An economic index based on measures of activity in real estate,
retailing, services, international trade, manufacturing and tourism
for the nine Bay area counties shows the region's economy virtually
recovered from the quake by December after a small dip in October
and November.
   The index compiled by Tapan Munroe, an economist with Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co. in San Francisco, and Walter E. Hoadley, a
Hoover Institution senior fellow, showed the overall strength of a
diversified economy that had long planned on ways to cope with a
big quake.
   ``The preparedness paid off,'' Munroe said. ``The region fared
very well in terms of emergency services.''
   Early estimates of $7 billion to $10 billion in damage have been
scaled down, but Munroe said the current figure of $5.6 billion
from state officials is still too high.
   Hotel and restaurant owners said their businesses still suffer,
though hotel occupancy rates in San Francisco are close to normal
even after the post-quake opening of two new large hotels, said
Steve Reiser of the accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster.
   Passenger arrivals at San Francisco International Airport were
off 11.8 percent in October and 4 percent in November from the same
months in 1988. But arrivals were up 0.7 percent in December.
   Fewer travelers from within the United States are coming to San
Francisco this year because of higher domestic air fares, but
international arrivals are booming, said airport spokesman Ron
Wilson.
   Ray Brady, research director for the Association of Bay Area
Governments in Oakland, said the region pulled through the quake so
easily because the economy is decentralized. When the Bay Bridge
collapse cut traffic in San Francisco, he noted, retail sales went
up in the East Bay _ so total retail sales in the region remained
constant.
   Traffic began rolling over the repaired Bay Bridge a month after
its partial collapse, and workers are continuing to repair the two
closed sections of Highway 101.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos wants to replace the Embarcadero
Freeway, long considered an eyesore, with an underground
expressway. The city's Board of Supervisors approved the plan
Monday night despite a three-hour strike by Chinatown merchants,
who claim that repairing the existing roadway would be cheaper and
get business traffic back into the depressed area more quickly.

   The head of the panel of Eastern Airlines'
unsecured creditors says the group has lost confidence in the
ability of the airline's managers to pull the company out of its
financial troubles.
   Eastern's unsecured creditors were expected to continue pressing
their case today for a trustee to run the company. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland, meanwhile, indicated at a hearing Monday
he did not favor a liquidation of the airline.
   Alan Boyd, chairman of the unsecured creditors' committee, cited
Eastern's continuing financial losses and what he called
management's inability to forecast results with ``anything close to
reality.''
   Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie of North America, also said
at Monday's hearing that Eastern's management had shown itself
unable to regain the confidence of the flying public and travel
agents since a devastating strike more than a year ago.
   Airbus, the jet maker owned by a consortium of European nations,
is one of Eastern's major suppliers and is owed roughly $100
million by the airline.
   The creditors' committee wants Lifland to appoint a special
trustee to take over the management of Eastern in place of Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. Eastern's
management said appointment of a trustee would doom the airline.
   The hearing began with a lengthy session last Friday. Eastern
also is asking the judge for permission to withdraw $80 million
from an escrow account to cover second-quarter operations.
   Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes are expected to testify
for the company today or later in the week as the hearing continues.
   Eastern has been attempting to reorganize under bankruptcy court
protection from creditors, but several attempted restructuring
plans either have failed to win creditor approval or have fallen
through.
   Boyd said creditors objected, among other things, to Eastern's
proposal to sell its maintenance facility in Miami for about $100
million because they believed it would remove an integral part of
Eastern's operations.
   Boyd said the committee, which had been supportive of Eastern's
previous reorganization proposals, began to change its attitude
early this year when the airline proposed cutting debt payments to
creditors.
   The committee lost confidence after Eastern said on March 27
that it no longer could honor an earlier proposal to repay
unsecured creditors 50 cents for every dollar owed, Boyd said.
   The same day, the unsecured creditors passed a resolution to
seek a trustee to liquidate Eastern if Texas Air didn't agree to
cover the company's losses. Since then, the committee has shifted
and said it wants a trustee either to sell the airline as a going
concern or in parts.
   Eastern owes the creditors around $980 million. Preferred
shareholders _ who still are seeking to liquidate the airine _ are
due $680 million.
   Bruce Zirinsky, an attorney for Eastern, warned Monday that
appointment of a trustee would be ``one more step'' toward the
liquidation of Eastern, which he said could have serious financial
consequences to creditors.
   However, Lifland responded that if a trustee were appointed to
operate Eastern, it would be someone in the airline industry.
   A travel agent, appearing as a witness for Eastern, warned that
the airline would lose business if a trustee were designated to run
it.
   ``The word trustee would be equated with liquidation and I, for
one, would book away from Eastern,'' said Richard Copeland,
president of the New York chapter of the American Society of Travel
Agents and the head of Hillside Travel Inc. in New York.
   The pilots, Machinists and flight attendants unions struck
Eastern on March 4, 1989, forcing the Miami-based airline into
bankruptcy protection five days later. The Machinists union remains
on strike.
   The unions have sought a trustee almost from the outset. They
claim Lorenzo has been bleeding Eastern by funneling assets to
Texas Air and to Continental Airlines, Eastern's largely non-union
sister carrier.
   A report by court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro filed in
early March suggested Texas Air had victimized Eastern by
underpaying for the airline and some of its assets by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 investors hit by losses at
eight real estate funds seeking independence from troubled VMS
Realty Partners are hoping an audit will bring some good news, an
industry analyst says.
   The funds involved _ five real estate investment trusts and
three publicly traded trusts _ reported a total of nearly $260
million in net losses for 1989 on Monday.
   They were formed as mortgage vehicles to make loans on
properties _ mostly commercial _ that were being developed by VMS
Realty Partners, one of the nation's largest real estate companies.
   The company announced in February that it was suspending most
payments to creditors and to the eight funds due to severe cash
flow problems that analysts said were a sign of the weak real
estate syndication business.
   The funds' financial problems were ``no surprise,'' said Barry
Vinocur, editor of the Stanger Register, a monthly financial
magazine on real estate investments published in Shrewsbury, N.J.
   The important news will be the results of an analysis of VMS
finances by the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Vinocur said.
The analysis will study the mortgage loans and underlying
collateral of all eight funds to determine what dividends, if any,
will be paid by the funds.
   ``The issue for these investors is really straightforward,'' he
said. ``That is, what's the value of the assets that these trusts
and partnerships own.''
   Investors also want to know ``what is the likelihood that
current management can maximize the investment that is there,'' he
said.
   VMS Mortgage Investment Fund reported the biggest loss of the
eight, $109.2 million or $2.75 a share, compared with a 1988 net
income of $9.5 million, or 73 cents a share.
   Leonard G. Levine, president of the funds, said in a statement
that the losses included provisions for possible loan losses.
   The funds' independent board of directors ``will continue to
seek to realize the maximum amount possible in connection with its
mortgage loans,'' he said.
   VMS Realty has managed assets of more than $9 billion, including
high-profile hotels in Florida, California and Hawaii.
   After the company's February announcement, Levine and four other
VMS officers resigned. Levine was appointed chief of the eight
funds, which are now managed by an independent board of directors
and are seeking new names.
   These developments followed a management shakeup in November
that put Jeffrey J. Park, a former Xerox executive, in charge of
VMS. A Xerox subsidiary, Xerox Credit Corp., owns 25 percent of
VMS. VMS in November also announced a $110 million writeoff.
   The other funds andtheir reported 1989 losses are:
   _VMS Mortgage Investors Limited Partnership ii, $34.7 million,
or $2.75 per unit, compared with 1988 net income of $11.9 million
or 94 cents a unit
   _VMS Mortgage Investors Limited Partnership, $32.3 million, or
$4.20 a unit, compared with 1988 net income of $10 million, or
$1.30 a unit.
   _VMS Strategic Land Fund II, $27.5 million or $1.43 a share,
compared with 1988 net income of $20.6 million or $1.11 a share.
   _VMS Hotel Investment Fund, $25 million or $2.54 a share,
compared with 1988 net income of $7.2 million, or 74 cents a share.
   _VMS Mortgage Investors Limited Partnership III, $19.4 million,
or $1.71 a unit, compared with 1988 net income of $9.6 million, or
86 cents a share.
   _VMS Strategic Land Trust, $9 million, or 75 cents a share,
compared with 1988 net income of $13.1 million, or $1.10 a share.
   _VMS Short Term Income Trust, $2.7 million, or 39 cents a share,
compared with 1988 net income of $7.8 million, or $1.14 a share.

<HEAD>Japanese Companies to Buy California Computer Printer Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dataproducts Corp. said a $160 million
takeover by two Japanese companies will give the company access to
advanced laser-printing technology and an entry into Asian markets.
   Monday's deal with Hitachi Koki Co. Ltd. and Nissei Sangyo Co.
Ltd. marked the end of independence for Dataproducts, a maker of
computer printers that had been beseiged by foreign competition and
unwanted takeover bids.
   The buyers, both members of Japan's largest manufacturing group,
the Hitachi Group, will benefit in turn from a patented
Dataproducts' process that shoots a jet of ink that is solid at
room temperature.
   ``That's believed by most people in the industry to be the
technology which will be used to bring low-cost vivid color
printing,'' Dataproducts Chairman Jack C. Davis said in a telephone
interview.
   ``This gives all three of us the ability to be strongly
positioned,'' said Davis, who will stay on as chairman, reporting
to a private board made up of officials of the other companies,
under terms of the deal.
   Hitachi Koki, which makes electrical equipment and power tools,
and Nissei Sangyo, which makes machinery and light equipment and
has sales offices in 22 countries, agreed to pay $10 per share for
Dataproducts.
   Dataproducts stock shot up $3.25 a share to close at $9.62{ on
the American Stock Exchange.
   Under an agreement approved by Dataproducts' board, a joint
venture of the Japanese companies will make a cash tender offer for
all of Dataproducts' outstanding shares.
   ``Dataproducts is an outstanding company,'' Hiroshi Gommori,
Hitachi Koki's president, said in a statement. ``We and Nissei
Sangyo respect its reputation, technology and management.''
   Last year, DPC Acquisition pursued an unsolicited $15-a-share
bid for Dataproducts, but Dataproducts rejected it and the deal
fell through. DPC was an acquisition group led by John K. Castle,
the former chief executive of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities, a New York investment banking firm.
   Dataproducts instead announced its own restructuring, which
involved selling its 22-acre headquarters property, paying a
special $2-a-share dividend, eliminating 400 U.S. jobs _ a fifth of
its domestic work force _ and trying to sell a New England
subsidiary that made heavy-duty printers.
   The company has struggled to update its products with laser
technology, cut operating costs and maintain its sales and profit
growth.
   Using engines purchased from Toshiba, Sharp and other Japanese
manufacturers, for example, Dataproducts built a machine capable of
printing 26 lines per minute. Hitachi Koki, on the other hand,
makes printers that can handle up to 135 lines per minute.
   In its latest earnings report, Dataproducts said it lost $4.1
million, or 21 cents per share, for its third fiscal quarter,
compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.6 million, or 8 cents a
share. Revenue declined 16 percent from $94.5 million to $79.3
million, the company said in the January report.
   In the fiscal year ending March 25, 1989, it earned $3.8 million
on sales of $353.4 million, down from a $9 million profit a year
earlier.
   Hitachi Koki had sales last year of 109 billion yen, or about
$686 million at current exchange rates. Nissei Sangyo's revenues
were 482 billion yen, or $3 billion.
   Davis said he had been talking with representatives of the other
companies since the middle of last year, in the middle of the
unwelcome takeover bid by DPC.
   ``The philosophies of the companies are similar in terms of a
drive for high-quality products,'' Davis said.

<HEAD>Convenience Store Chain Misses Debt-Interest Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. put a halt on interest payments to
bondholders as part of an agreement with its banks that is intended
to restructure the ailing convenience store chain's $1.3 billion in
debt.
   Circle K on Monday missed a deadline for an interest payment on
$125 million in 12} percent debentures due in 1997, heeding the
request of its bankers.
   Under an agreement in principle announced April 4, bank lenders
that have extended nearly $800 million in senior debt to Circle K
have the right to determine whether the company can pay interest on
subordinated debt.
   ``The banks have exercised that prerogative at this point,''
said Ray Cox, a spokesman for Circle K. The company operates the
nation's second largest convenience store chain with 4,651 stores,
and licenses about 1,350 overseas.
   The agreement is part of a restructuring that could include
exchanging some outstanding subordinated debt securities for new
bonds, stock or cash.
   The company plans to file exchange-offer materials with the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission before May 15, Cox said.
   Circle K is considering offering a new bond issue to holders of
the 12} percent bonds or 13 percent debentures, both due in 1997,
as well as privately held notes, 8\ percent debentures due in 2005
and 7\ percent securities due in 2006.
   The new issue, about equal to the market value of the existing
bonds, would be convertible into a majority of the company's common
stock, Cox said. Circle K also is considering giving bondholders an
option to receive cash at about market value for their securities.
   American Financial Corp., the company's largest shareholder and
a creditor, tentatively has agreed to buy $100 million of the new
bond issue, Cox said. But he said Circle K has not finalized the
offer.
   Under a standstill agreement, American Financial, the bank
lenders and holders of $200 million in notes due Oct. 15, 1993,
will defer all principal and interest payments on Circle K debt and
waive any existing payment defaults.
   The banks are entitled to judge the company's ability to make
interest payments on its debt. The agreement will last until Oct.
31 or the completion of the company's restructuring, whichever is
earlier.
   Cox said Circle K believes it will have sufficient cash to meet
daily business obligations during the restructuring.
   Because of the restructuring, Circle K has not completed sale of
350 stores in the Pacific Northwest. Circle K orginally said it
expected to close the sale to PC Venture Ltd. of Canada by April 1.
   The company also has announced its intention to sell 25 stores
in Hawaii to Texaco Refining and Marketing Co. by May 15, but Cox
said that deal also may be delayed.

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep held a
peace lunch with Harold Simmons, the billionaire Texan who tried
but failed to wrest away control of the aerospace company in a
proxy battle.
   Monday's meeting was set up after Simmons received an invitation
from Tellep more than two weeks ago, Simmons spokesman Largent
Parks said. He called the invitation ``sort of an olive-branch type
of thing.''
   The lunch followed a reconvening of the company's annual
meeting, at which Lockheed revealed the official tally of votes in
the proxy battle.
   Simmons and Tellep had no immediate comment on their luncheon.
   Tellep offered to hold a series of talks with Simmons and other
major Lockheed shareholders after Lockheed's annual meeting March
29.
   Simmons lost a proxy battle for control of Lockheed's board that
culminated at the meeting. Several big institutional shareholders
sided with him, though, leading Tellep to make major concessions to
big shareholders. Those included a promise to create three new
board seats for them.
   About 120 people, mostly Lockheed workers and retirees, attended
Monday's reconvened meeting, which lasted seven minutes at a hotel
in Woodland Hills. Tellep thanked them for supporting him.
   As earlier announced, Simmons' nominees for Lockheed's board
were defeated, getting slightly less than 40 percent of the votes,
but shareholders rights issues backed by Simmons passed.
   Those included a recommendation that Lockheed drop its ``poison
pill'' provision, which makes it prohibitively expensive for any
person or institution to acquire more than 20 percent of Lockheed's
shares.
   Simmons, through his N.L. Industries, owns 18.9 percent of
Lockheed's common stock. He paid about $530 million for his shares
and has a paper loss to date of about $100 million.
   Simmons had said he wanted to force Lockheed to concentrate
harder on its core businesses. He said he would sell assets from
the technology services and electronics systems groups if they
could not quickly turn bigger profits.
   Profits at Lockheed, the nation's sixth-largest military
contractor, fell from $624 million in 1988 to $2 million last year.
That was chiefly because the company took nearly $500 million in
special charges after underestimating the costs of developing
several programs, such as a submarine-hunting plane.
   Lockheed said holders of 82 percent of its stock, 52,685,008
shares of the 63,192,196 shares outstanding, had cast votes.
   Lockheed's directors got from 57.6 percent to 60.7 percent of
the votes.
   On other issues:
   _A recommendation that Lockheed adopt confidential voting, one
of the issues on which Tellep gave ground, passed by 60 percent.
   _A bylaw amendment exempting Lockheed from the tough
anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, another measure on which
Tellep flip-flopped, passed by 61 percent. Lockheed, with
headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas, is
incorporated in Delaware.
   _The recommendation to overturn the ``poison pill'' passed by 54
percent, with 41 percent against and 5 percent abstaining.
Excluding shares voted by N.L. Industries, which proposed the
measure, it would have lost by a wide margin, Lockheed said. Tellep
has refused to give ground on this issue.

<HEAD>Landmark to Sell Kiawah Properties, Along With Others For $967
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California developer will pay $967
million to buy the golf courses, hotel and amenities on Kiawah
Island and other properties in California and Florida from Landmark
Land Co., a company official said.
   Gerald G. Barton, president and chairman of Landmark, said the
sale is scheduled to be completed in June 1991. The buyer is
Irvine, Calif., developer Barry G. Hon and his Palos Verdes Land
Holdings Inc.
   ``It should have very little effect on Kiawah. We're selling the
collection of properties instead of piecemealing them,'' Barton
said Monday. ``He's acquiring the whole management team. He has the
option (of selling them off individually), but I don't think he
will.''
   Landmark's property will be sold in two phases, Barton said.
   The first phase of the sale will take place this year, and
involves the sale for $497 million of a substantial portion of
Landmark's golf, tennis and large-tract development divisions in
California. Landmark will finance about 79 percent of the sale.
   Specifically, Hon will buy Oak Valley, Oak Summit, Greenspot and
Moreno Valley Ranch developments together with the Carmel Valley
Ranch golf and tennis resort.
   Kiawah will be sold during the second phase, along with
properties in West Palm Beach, Fla.; and Riverside and Placer
counties, Calif. The second phase will cost about $470 million, of
which Landmark will finance about 76 percent.
   The sales would leave Landmark with about $400 million in real
estate in California, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Most of those
properties are expected to be disposed of over the next five years.
   Landmark, which is based in Carmel, Calif., has received high
marks for the beauty and design of its properties, but its fortunes
have sagged along with the economies of Oklahoma and Louisiana.
   Even many of its golf courses, considered among the world's
best, have had negative cash flow, said Kenneth Campbell, president
of Audit Investments Inc., a Montvale, N.J., investment advisory
firm that follows real estate companies.
   Landmark posted a fourth quarter 1989 loss of $20.5 million,
compared with a profit of $16.9 million a year earlier.
   Hon owns property in Oklahoma, Louisiana and California, and is
best known for his 2,743-acre Foothill Ranch development in South
Orange County, Calif.
   Palos Verdes Land Holdings Inc. currently is developing a Ritz
Carlton Resort Hotel and golf course as well as custom homes in
Rancho Palos Verdes, an exclusive suburb of Los Angeles.
   Hon is a board member of the South Coast Medical Center, a
founder of the Orange County Performing Arts Center and retired
chairman of the board of Eldorado Bank. He is a member of the
Orange County Transportation Commission Toll Road Task Force and
holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Tulsa.

<HEAD>Yamaichi Securities Faces $24 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's 17 major
securities companies, said Tuesday it faces a loss of $24 million
due to one customer's bankruptcy last month.
   Yamaichi, on orders from a customer late in February, bought 3
million shares _ or one-seventh of the total outstanding _ of
Nippon Seisen, a leading wire maker, at the equivalent of about $44
million for delivery in four days.
   Yamaichi was supposed to receive $70,520 in commission for the
transaction, but ``the customer, an institutional investor, failed
to settle the transaction and went bankrupt on March 30,'' said
Yamaichi spokesman Takao Adachi.
   Meantime, he said, prices on the Tokyo stock market began to
crash and the price of Nippon Seisen's shares plunged to $6.54 a
share on Tuesday from $14.65 in February.
   ``Negotiations for remedy are ongoing. If they fail, the company
might bring the case to the court because there's always
possibility that manipulation might have been involved in a case
like this,'' Adachi said.
   Manipulation is the act of depressing or raising prices
artificially so that they do not represent true value. This is done
by creating an appearance of active buying or selling, either alone
or in concert with others. The act violates Japan's securities law
and is subject to criminal and civil penalties.
   Adachi said the investor, a company operating coffee shops, had
been a good customer for Yamaichi during the last two years,
although its earlier investments were made on a smaller scale.
   No comment was immediately available from Osaka-based Nippon
Seisen.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell at the government's weekly auction.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $8.2 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.71 percent, down
from 7.80 percent last week. Another $8.2 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.75 percent, also
down from 7.80 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.65
percent on Feb. 12, and six-month bills averaged 7.70 percent on
Feb. 26.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.97 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,805.10 and 8.18 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,608.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, was unchanged last
week from 8.29 percent the previous week.

   Last-minute tax filers trying to beat Uncle Sam's deadline were
handed free aspirin in post office lines, while others scrambled
for 11th-hour tax shelters. A postal worker was injured by a letter
bomb addressed to ``tax thieves.''
   Millions of procrastinators produced the usual midnight crowds
and traffic jams in cities large and small as Tax Day 1990 drew to
a close.
   An envelope containing a tea bag in apparent reference to the
tax protest that helped spark the American Revolution blew up
Monday night outside the Royal Oak Post Office in suburban Detroit
as workers collected tax returns. The bomb spewed a red liquid.
   A 29-year-old postal worker, Tom Berlucchi, was treated at a
hospital for burns on his hands and face, authorities said.
   A woman dressed as an aspirin bottle handed out samples at the
post office in Chicago, and a Philadelphia radio station blasting
rock music from a van gave away stamps. At Twentieth Century
Investors Inc. in Kansas City, customers opened more than 130
Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, in three hours.
   ``We even burned out a fax machine getting applications to
clients out of town,'' said Gunnar Hughes, a Twentieth Century
spokesman.
   The Internal Revenue Service did not estimate how many taxpayers
waited until the last minute. But the agency predicted about 34
million returns _ more than 30 percent of the 111 million expected
this year _ would be filed after April 6.
   The deadline is usually April 15, but it was a Sunday this year
so the IRS delayed it a day.
   The IRS Form 4868 was one of the most-sought pieces of paper in
the nation as an estimated 6 million Americans abandoned hopes of
meeting the midnight deadline. Filing a Form 4868, along with a
check for estimated taxes owed, extends the deadline to Aug. 15.
   Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman was among the late and bleary
eyed. ``I always wait until the last minute to do my own taxes
because I spend the first three months of the year worrying about
everyone else's. But I always get a refund,'' he said.
   Elliott Swinton, 27, who was among those in line at a copy
machine in Philadelphia, said he did his taxes weeks ago but
delayed filing them until the last minute. ``We owed money. Why
give it to them two months ago?'' he said.
   A New York City sales representative, 24-year-old Michael
Alleyne, balanced his state form on his knees on the steps of the
main post office in Manhattan.
   ``I mailed the federal form at 9:30 and then did the state form
out here on the steps,'' he said. ``But at least I had the envelope
filled out. I didn't procrastinate that part.''
   Dozens of taxpayers in Norfolk, Va., are going to have to do
their taxes over because of two mailbox fires discovered Monday
that postal inspectors think were deliberately set.
   Sixty-five tax envelopes were in good enough shape to send on to
the IRS, but 37 were too damaged to forward. On several, the name
of the taxpayer was destroyed, postal workers said.
   ``It's all I need,'' said Shirley Evans, when she found out she
had to redo her burned tax form. ``I think there's a lot of sick
people in the world who do things like that. I have better things
to do than set a mailbox on fire.''
   Demonstrators, mostly those who oppose the use of tax dollars
for defense or nuclear projects or who oppose paying taxes
altogether, mingled in post office crowds in Philadelphia, suburban
Atlanta and Greenfield, Mass.
   ``We're here to say our taxes are going to the wrong place ...
to defense,'' said Rich Garella, 24, of Philadelphia.
   ``The people dropping off their taxes here tonight are funding
the war in El Salvador. They should be spent on human needs here.
There are people sleeping on grates.''
   Decatur, Ga., Postmaster Crawford Lovett had 15 or 20 tax
protesters in his domain carrying signs against the use of tax
dollars to finance nuclear weapons.
   ``One woman was dressed up like an angel, carrying a `ban the
bomb' sign and a huge American flag. Then she walks over to my
employee and hands him her tax return,'' Lovett said.

<HEAD>Co-Founder of Company That Became Marriott Dies at 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VERNAL, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hugh Wilkens Colton, a rancher, lawyer, war
hero and co-founder of the company that later became the Marriott
Corp., has died. He was 89.
   Colton died Saturday at his home in Vernal.
   In 1927, Colton opened a root beer stand in Washington, D.C.,
with his longtime friend J. Willard Marriott.
   The partners went on to open three Hot Shoppes Restaurants
before Colton sold his interest to Marriott for $5,000.
   Colton, who graduated from the University of Utah and George
Washington Law School, was a commander in the Utah National Guard.
He was called to active duty before Pearl Harbor and commanded
troops that landed at Normandy on D-day.
   He achieved the rank of colonel and was awarded military honors
of three countries, including the Silver Star with oak leaf
cluster, French Croix de Guerre and Belgium Medal of Honor.
   Colton raised cattle and horses and was a director of the Utah
Cattlemen's Association and the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.
   He was active in regional and local water conservancy. He worked
for many years on the Upper Colorado River Project, serving as
chairman of a four-state committee that secured funding from
Congress.
   He also was active in the Mormon Church.
   Colton is survived by his wife, Marguerite Maughan Colton, three
sons, 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Northeast Bancorp-Bank of New York Merger in Doubt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed merger between Bank of New
York Co. and Northeast Bancorp Inc. is in jeopardy because the two
sides cannot agree on how much Northeast is worth.
   In documents filed Monday with the Federal Reserve Board, Bank
of New York placed the value of Northeast stock at $12.31 a share.
   Northeast, the parent of Union Trust Co. of New Haven,
maintained its shares had a book value of $33.50 as of March 31.
   Bank of New York said it based its calculations on a thorough
asessment of Northeast's loans.
   ``It's going to be difficult to reach a compromise,'' said
Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker, Anthony Inc. He said a
merger looks doubtful.
   The two banks agreed to merge in 1983, at which time Bank of New
York said it would pay 1.85 times the book value. The deal, which
expires Aug. 15, was amended in 1986 to 2.5 times book value.
   Northeast said it views the merger plans as a legal contract and
would ``pursue all legal remedies'' to enforce the agreement.
   A new interstate banking law in Connecticut would have allowed
the two to merge last month.

<HEAD>Profit Slump Blamed on Falling Aluminum Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynolds Metals Co. on Tuesday reported a
37.6 percent drop in its first quarter income reflecting a steep
decline in prices for aluminum ingot and other aluminum products.
   The Richmond-based metals company said it earned $77.7 million,
or $1.31 a share, in the three months ended March 31, down from
$124.5 million, or $2.28 a share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue in the latest quarter fell about 4 percent to $1.39
billion from $1.45 billion in the corresponding 1989 quarter.
   William O. Bourke, Reynolds' chairman and chief executive
officer, said a steep decline in the price of aluminum ingot and
many aluminum fabricated products affected first-quarter earnings.
   ``Aluminum ingot prices today are approximately 40 percent below
where they were at the beginning of 1989, and we have seen varying
degrees of price erosion for many fabricated aluminum products as a
result,'' Bourke said.
   However, Bourke said aluminum demand and prices have improved in
recent weeks.
   The company's aluminum shipments in the first quarter were up 2
percent from first-quarter 1989 to 319,700 metric tons, compared
with 312,900 tons a year ago.
   The company's annual shareholders' meeting will be held
Wednesday in Richmond.

   Prices moved broadly lower on Wall Street today
after a double dose of bad economic news dashed trader hopes for an
easing of interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 13.29 to 2,749.77 as of
11 a.m. EDT.
   Declining issues had a 3 to 1 lead over advancers, with 319
stocks rising, 967 falling and 488 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Big Board volume came to 47 million shares at mid-morning.
   Prices took a series of hits from two March economic indicators
and the bond market's reaction to them.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices soared an unexpectedly
high 0.5 percent last month, pushing the inflation rate for the
first three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight
years.
   The stock market was most concerned by a 0.7 percent rise in
prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories.
   The government also reported today that industrial production
rose 0.7 percent last month due in large part to increases in the
output of automobiles following a major cutback in January.
   Both reports wiped out hopes that the Federal Reserve might
nudge interest rates lower anytime soon. The Fed has been trying to
keep inflation in check and the economy from overheating by keeping
keeping rates relatively high.
   Wall Street took its cue from the bond market, with skidded in
response to the reports. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was
off $12.50 per $1,000 face value early today.
   IBM, which shot up 3} after a rosy earnings report on Monday,
was off } to 110&lsqb; and led the NYSE most active list today.

<HEAD>Sony to Make Picture Tubes at Former Volkswagen Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with more details, comments from Sony official,

<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. will manufacture picture tubes for
large color television sets at a shuttered Volkswagen assembly
plant outside Pittsburgh, creating about 1,000 jobs in the next
three years, Gov. Robert Casey said today.
   Casey said at a news conference the Japanese electronics company
plans to spend about $300 million to refurbish and equip a 600-acre
parcel of the plant site near New Stanton, about 45 miles southeast
of Pittsburgh.
   The company also will lease a 200-acre parcel nearby for ``the
possible development within the next five years of an additional
new manufacturing facility,'' according to an agreement signed
today by Casey and Masaaki Morita, chairman of Sony Corp. of
America.
   ``Sony's TV business in the United States is growing while at
the same time the market trend is toward larger and larger screen
sizes,'' Morita said.
   He said Sony decided to locate in Pennsylvania in order to be
closer to key suppliers in central and eastern United States. The
company already has a picture-tube plant in San Diego.
   ``We believe we must make the product in the market where we
sell it,'' he said.
   Sony will lease the property from the state, which will provide
$23.5 million dollars in loans and job training grants to the
company, Casey said.
   About 2,500 auto workers lost their jobs two years ago when
Volkswagen of America Inc. closed the assembly plant after 10 years
of production. Since then, the 2.8 million-square-foot plant has
been on the market.
   Sony confirmed in October it was looking at several sites in
southwestern Pennsylvania for a possible location for a sixth U.S.
plant.
   ``Our highest economic development priority these past two years
has been bringing new jobs and new hope to the families of
Westmoreland County and the entire region,'' Casey said.
   He said Sony's decision to invest in the plant marks a
successful conclusion to those efforts.
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said the plant will help balance
the United States' huge trade deficit with Japan.
   ``It means a great deal more than jobs and investment,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade despite
profit-taking in the wake of Monday's sharp rise in prices.
   Corn prices opened steady to fractionally higher as traders
consolidated Monday's gains. Analysts say continued foreign demand
could boost prices.
   Wheat prices also were fractionally higher in early trading, on
expectations the Soviet Union will make an additional bid for U.S.
wheat under the export bonus program.
   Soybean futures were slightly higher despite profit taking at
the open.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.71 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to } cent
higher with May at $2.72 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3\ cents
higher with May at $1.55{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1}
cents higher with May at $5.91\ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with prices pressured by followthrough
selling from Monday's weak close.
   Expectation that supplies will increase through the spring and
into summer caused the selling of live cattle futures. Feeder
cattle prics were pushed lower by live cattle's weakness.
   Lower cash prices put pressure on live hog futures, and frozen
pork bellies were pushed lower by expectation of lower fresh belly
prices.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .03 cent higher with April at
79.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to .55 cent lower
with April at 83.82 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .35 cent

<HEAD>Double-Digit Increase in GE's First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., buoyed by new
orders in its aircraft engine and power systems divisions, on
Tuesday reported a 12 percent profit gain for the first quarter.
   GE reported earnings of $950 million in the three months ended
March 31, up from $849 million in the first quarter of 1989.
Earnings per share were up 13 percent, to $1.06 from 94 cents.
   Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.6 billion in the first quarter of
this year from $11.9 billion a year earlier.
   ``Very strong earnings improvements were reported by GE Capital,
Power Systems and Aircraft Engines,'' said GE chairman John F.
Welch Jr.
   Other divisions with higher earnings included lighting, medical
systems, transportation systems, and electrical distribution and
controls.
   He said new orders for power generation were up 60 percent from
the first quarter of 1989, while orders from the company's medical
systems division were 25 percent ahead of last year.
   The company reported a total backlog of $35 billion in the
aircraft engine division, following new orders from Lufthansa and
from Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.
   GE said operating profit from its major appliances division was
even with last year, while profit and revenue from its broadcasting
arm, NBC, were ``somewhat below'' the first-quarter figures in 1989.
   Operating profit from its materials division was down
considerably, which the company attributed to slower demand for
cars, appliances and housing.
   GE said growth in earnings per share was slightly higher than
net earnings because of a $10 billion share repurchase program
announced last year. Under the program, the company bought back
11.6 million shares for $728 million in the first quarter, bringing
total shares acquired to 15.3 million, for a total $963 million,
since the program began in November 1989.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T And Two Unions Reach Tentative Agreement on Early Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 34,000 union employees of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. would be eligible for early
retirement under a tentative buyout agreement reached between
unions and management, officials from both sides said Tuesday.
   Beginning May 1, the company would add at least three years to
each worker's age and tenure and five years for those workers whose
jobs are considered obsolete, said AT&amp;T spokesmkan Burke Stinson.
   Workers in the latter category, including telephone operators,
would also receive a 15 percent boost in monthly pension payments,
Stinson said.
   The unions involved are the Communications Workers of America
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   The proposal follows similar incentives offered last year to
managers as AT&amp;T seeks to trim its workforce and modernize
operations in the wake of the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   Last year, 39 percent, or 12,535 of 32,121 managers, opted to
retire early under a plan that added five years to each manager's
age and tenure, and boosted pension payments by 15 percent.
   IBEW spokesman Joe Penna said the proposal on the table is an
improvement over an offer rejected by the unions last month. AT&amp;T
offered to add five years to each worker's age, but did not
increase the size of the pension payments, Stinson said.
   Penna said business managers plan to meet next week to discuss
the proposal. About one-third of the eligible workers _ between
8,000 and 12,000 _ are expected to opt for early retirement, Penna
said.
   Stinson said AT&amp;T plans to trim 12,000 people from its payrolls
this year. The plan is seen as a measure to ``soften the impact,''
Stinson said.
   Representatives of the Communications Workers of America did not
immediately return telephone calls to their New York City
headquarters.
   AT&amp;T has 165,400 non-management workers.

   NCR Corp. on Tuesday said its income fell 15
percent in the first quarter due to lower profit margins and the
cost of a share repurchase program.
   The news hit NCR's stock hard. The stock tumbled $6.25 to $64.50
a share by noon on the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading.
   The company earned $52 million, or 73 cents a share, in the
first three months of 1990, down from $61 million, or 77 cents a

   Net income was negatively affected when the company repurchased
1.6 million common shares of stock this quarter. However, the stock
buyback had a favorable impact on earnings per share.
   First-quarter revenue was $1.27 billion, up 1 percent over last
year's $1.25 billion. And the company reported that first-quarter
orders reached the highest level for any quarter in NCR's history.
   ``Orders in the United States showed a gain, while orders
overseas achieved an all-time record with a substantial gain over

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber Group Inc. on Tuesday reported a 17
percent increase in first-quarter earnings, but the gains came
against a particularly weak quarter a year ago on Wall Street.
   PaineWebber, the nation's eighth-largest brokerage, said its
core businesses including retail sales and asset management all
showed improvement in the still-slumping securities industry.
   PaineWebber reported net income of $10.8 million, or 20 cents
per share, in the three months ended March 30. That was up from
$9.18 million, or 11 cents per share, in the same 1989 period.
Revenue rose 7 percent to $426 million from $397 million a year
earlier.
   Compared with the 1989 fourth quarter, overall earnings were
down slightly from $10.9 million.
   ``PaineWebber's first-quarter results represent continued
improved operating performance of our major businesses,''
PaineWebber Chairman Donald B. Marron said in a statement.
   He said retail sales, institutional equity, fixed income, asset
management and international businesses all showed improvement over
the first quarter of 1989, an extremely weak one during the
securities industry recession.
   The quarterly increase was the second reported by a Wall Street
firm despite the pronounced downturn in the securities industry
since the 1987 stock market crash. Other firms are expected to
report less positive results.
   PaineWebber said its first-quarter earnings were hurt by a weak
investment banking environment and losses from risk arbitrage
trading.
   PaineWebber's investment banking revenue was $67.6 million, a
12.7 percent gain, but sharply lower than $75.9 million in the 1989
fourth quarter. Brokerage commissions rose 8.5 percent to $162
million, but also were sharply lower than $179 million in the
fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Hallmark Accepts Tenders of Univision Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. said Tuesday it dropped a
key condition of a tender offer for $270 million in junk bonds
issued by the company's Univision Holdings Inc. unit, and had
accepted $251.9 million of the bonds for payment.
   Hallmark, a privately held greetings card company based in
Kansas City, Mo., also said it had reached an agreement with bank
lenders on restructuring the cash-strapped Spanish-language
television company's payments to the banks.
   Univision had been authorized to file for protection from
creditors under terms of the federal bankruptcy laws if the tender
offer was unsuccessful, and Hallmark's purchase averts that
possibility.
   Hallmark had offered to pay $131 million for two series of junk
bonds on which its 63.5 percent-owned Univision unit had missed
interest payments.
   But Hallmark had set as a requirement of its tender offer that
at least 90 percent of each issue must be tendered before it would
be obligated to buy any of the securities.
   On Tuesday, Hallmark said it had dropped that requirement and
accepted $162.7 million in subordinated discount notes and $89.2
million in subordinated debentures that were tendered under the
offer.
   The securities tendered represented about 98.6 percent of the
discount notes but only about 85 percent of the outstanding
debentures.
   Hallmark also extended the tender offer, which was to have
expired at 5 p.m. Tuesday, for another week until 5 p.m. April 24.
   The company has agreed to defer interest payments on the
securities it purchases under the tender offer for five years.
   Univision Holdings, based in New York, operates an eight-station
Spanish-language TV network that reaches an estimated 92 percent of
Hispanic households in the United States.
   It was unable to make interest payments of about $10 million due
on its bonds and bank debt in February because of what it called
cash-flow problems.
   Hallmark offered to buy the bonds at a discount and defer
interest payments on them. Its first buyback offer of $106 million
failed to generate much interest, and it sweetened the offer to
$131 million on March 30.
   It separately agreed with certain banks to reschedule
Univision's bank loan repayments, provided it completed the tender
offer for the bonds.

   Stock prices declined today after two economic
reports punctured trader hopes for an easing of interest rates
anytime soon.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 6.30 to 2,756.76 as of
2 p.m. EDT after having been down more than 21 points early in the
session.
   Declining issues had a nearly 2 to 1 edge over advancers, with
490 stocks rising, 935 falling and 507 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume came to 89.65 million shares at midafternoon.
   Prices took a series of hits from two March economic indicators
and the bond market's reaction to them.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices soared an unexpectedly
high 0.5 percent last month, pushing the inflation rate for the
first three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight
years.
   Stock traders were particularly unnerved by a 0.7 percent rise
in prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories _
what's known as core inflation.
   The government also reported that industrial production rose 0.7
percent last month due in large part to increases in the output of
automobiles following a major cutback in January.
   Both reports wiped out hopes that the Federal Reserve might
nudge interest rates lower anytime soon. The Fed has been trying to
keep inflation in check and the economy from overheating by keeping
keeping rates relatively high.
   Wall Street took its cue from the bond market, with skidded in
response to the reports. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was
off about $12.19 per $1,000 face value today.
   Blue chip stocks recovered some of their gains while the broader
market lagged behind, repeating what has become a pattern in recent
sessions. Investors have more faith in the blue chips than the
secondary issues.
   NCR tumbled 5{ to 65\ and led the NYSE most-active list after
reporting a 15 percent first-quarter earnings decline.
   Warner Lambert, which reported an earnings increase, rose 2 to
111|. General Eletric, whose earnings report was in line with
market expectations, was off &lsqb; to 66|.
   IBM, which shot up 3} after a rosy earnings report on Monday,
was off \ to 110| today.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed common stocks was off 0.51 at
188.43. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
2.49 to 354.49.

<TEXT>
   American Home Products Corp. on Tuesday reported
a 12.3 percent gain in its first quarter earnings as the company
benefited from a lower effective tax rate.
   Sales grew 3.8 percent for the diversified maker of consumer
products including Woolite, Easy-Off oven cleaner and similarly
well-known household names.
   The company earned $314.49 million, or $2.01 a share, in the
three months ended March 31, up from $280.09 million, or $1.81 a
share, in the corresponding 1989 quarter.
   Sales totaled $1.81 billion in the first quarter compared to
$1.75 billion a year earlier.
   Results for 1989 were restated to reflect American Home
Products' acquisition of A.H. Robins Co. Inc., the drug company
that makes Robitussin cough syrup, Chap Stick lip balm and other
products.
   Robins, facing numerous lawsuits stemming from its Dalkon Shield
birth control device, entered bankruptcy court proceedings in 1985.
American Home Products bought Robins last year.
   American Home Products said it had a lower effective tax rate in
the first quarter because it used losses Robins previously had
related to the funding of a trust to compensate victims of the
Dalkon Shield.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose modestly Tuesday against all
major currencies in light European trading following the long
Easter weekend.
   Gold prices declined.
   The dollar started out stronger, then fell back after the
release of data indicating continued strength in the U.S. economy,
dealers said.
   ``It's a bit surprising that the dollar is coming down, because
the figures were good and the U.S. interest rates are rising,''
said one dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``But before the trade
figures are out, we don't expect anything to happen.''
   The U.S. February trade report is scheduled for release on
Wednesday. Traders said markets were quiet ahead of that data,
which they expected to show a narrowing American trade deficit.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. government reported that industrial
production rose 0.7 percent in March and consumer prices surged an
unexpectedly sharp 0.5 percent last month.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar rose to a
closing 159.83 Japanese yen from 159.42 yen Monday. Later, in
London, it rose to 159.85 yen. By mid-afternoon Tuesday in New York
the dollar stood at 159.73 yen, up from Monday's close of 159.30.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6340 from $1.6425 late
Thursday. Sterling bought $1.6370 in New York at mid-afternoon
Tuesday, up from $1.63035 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.6770 West German marks, up from 1.6730; 1.4900 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4835; 5.6370 French francs, up from 5.6213; 1.8885 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8840; 1,232.00 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50;
and 1.1680 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633.
   The European markets were closed on Friday and Monday for the
Easter holiday.
   Mid-afternoon Tuesday dollar rates in New York, compared with
Monday's close, included: 1.6785 West German marks, up from 1.6778;
1.4910 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900; 5.6420 French francs, up from
5.6365; 1,233.25 Italian lire, up from 1,232.50; and 1.16405
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16885.
   Precious metal dealers said many traders had extended their
Easter holidays and markets were quiet.
   ``With the uncertainty in the market, nobody knows which way
gold will turn,'' said a London bullion dealer. ``And with movement
so narrow, professionals aren't interested in taking significant
positions. There is no incentive to do anything.''
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $374.05 a troy ounce,
down from $375.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing
bid of $374 an ounce, down from $375.50 Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at $375.39 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.07 a
troy ounce, down from $5.11 Thursday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand and cold wet
weather in some crop-producing states affected the market.
   Soybean futures were higher on the strength of soybean oil,
which posted contract highs from August outward.
   The bullish nature of soyoil is due to an expectation of tight
domestic stocks for the remainder of the 1989-1990 marketing year.
The National Oilseed Processor Association on Monday reported a
drop in its March soyoil stocks, a period when inventories usually
increase.
   Harvest delays in South America also proved to be a boost in
soybean prices, said Jerry Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine
Corp. in Chicago.
   Corn prices reached new contract highs due to concern over the
cold and wet weather in the corn belt that has delayed planting.
   ``We could use a week to 10 days of dry weather to allow farmers
to plant their crops,'' Zusel said, adding that the corn pit would
turn bullish once the crop was in the ground and if the rain
continued.
   Selling on the part of speculators sent old crop wheat futures
down sharply. Analysts noted that old crop wheat has been selling
at a premium because of demand.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5{ cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.65 a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 3\ cents higher with May at $2.74 a bushel; oats were 4 cents to
5\ cents higher with May at $1.57} a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents

<HEAD>$263 Million Loss for 1989, More than Double Earlier Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great American Bank lost a record $263.4
million last year _ more than double a previous estimate _ and may
be taken over by federal regulators unless the thrift can raise
$350 million by the end of the year, officials said Tuesday.
   Great American said in a statement that it may sell out or merge
with another institution to raise the needed capital.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and
loans, has approved a plan requiring Great American to raise $350
million in capital by Dec. 31 to meet regulatory capital
requirements.
   Great American reported in February that it lost $123.9 million
in 1989, but a six-week audit revealed its losses actually totaled
a record $263.4 million.
   It was one of the largest losses ever for a California thrift
and exceeded the previous record by Imperial Savings, which federal
regulators seized earlier this year after it posted a $259.1
million loss in 1989, the OTS said.
   Independent auditors who reviewed Great American's records found
new problems stemming from loans Great American made in the
Southwest, particularly in Arizona.
   The 1989 loss dropped Great American's capital level below all
three of the new capital adequacy tests outlined in thrift bailout
legislation approved by Congress last year.
   Much of Great American's problems have been attributed to its
1986 purchase of a Tucson thrift. Arizona has suffered an economic
slowdown since then, however, which has left Great American with a
portfolio of souring loans.
   In approving the institution's capital plan, regulators
established growth limits and several operating conditions on the
thrift that allow it to engage only in approved business activities
like residential and consumer lending.
   Great American can't pay dividends or make other capital
distributions without approval from regulators, who also have
required the thrift's board of trustees to submit quarterly
progress reports and meet quarterly capital targets.
   If it fails to meet any of the conditions, Great American faces
strict operating limits and possible seizure by federal regulators,
the thrift's statement said.
   Last month, Great American retained the investment banking firm
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help it raise capital. The bank
and its advisers are exploring several alternatives, Great American
said, including its possible sale or merger with another financial
institution.
   Great American said it also is pursuing alternatives that would
raise its capital levels, such as branch sales and other
divestiture transactions. That strategy, however, probably would
reduce the bank's earnings and leave it with a higher-level of
low-quality assets.
   The thrift said it's not sure if regulators would approve those
types of sales or, if they occurred, whether it would be sufficient
to bring the bank into compliance with regulatory guidelines.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T and Two Unions Reach Tentative Agreement on Early Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN LEVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has
reached a tentative agreement on an early retirement plan with two
unions, part of the company's effort to cut costs.
   The plan, which would add three years of age and service to each
worker's record on May 1, would nearly double the number of workers
eligible for a pension to 34,000, said AT&amp;T spokesman Burke Stinson.
   The plan allows some of AT&amp;T's divisions to offer some workers
greater retirement incentives _ five years added to age and
seniority and a 15 percent boost in monthly pension payments _ in
areas the company considers overstaffed, Stinson said.
   The unions affected are the Communications Workers of America
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   IBEW spokesman Joe Penna said the special incentives are aimed
at workers who would otherwise be laid off because their jobs have
been made obsolete by technology.
   AT&amp;T has 165,400 union workers worldwide.
   The proposal follows a similar package offered last year to
managers as part of AT&amp;T's six-year effort to reduce its workforce,
consolidate operations and modernize equipment in the aftermath of
the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   Last year 12,535 of 32,121 eligible managers opted to retire
early under a plan that added five years to each manager's age and
tenure, and boosted pension payments by 15 percent. There company
has 116,000 managers.
   The management program cost AT&amp;T $163 million and is expected to
save $450 million annually, Stinson said. No one has estimated the
savings from the latest proposal because it is not known how many
workers and how many organizations with the company will
participate in the early retirement plan, Stinson said.
   Penna said he expected about one-third of eligible union
employees _ between 8,000 and 12,000 workers _ to opt for early
retirement. He said the proposal was an improvement over an offer
rejected last month by the unions. That plan would have added five
years to each worker's age but would not have raised monthly
pension payments.
   Penna said the new package is a victory for unions because it
eliminates thousands of jobs through early retirement rather than
layoffs.
   AT&amp;T, with 280,400 employees worldwide, says it plans to cut
12,000 jobs this year. About 93,000 jobs have been eliminated since
1984, when a court order broke up the Bell Telephone monopoly into
competitive regional companies.

   The dollar ended lower Tuesday against major
foreign currencies after rising modestly overseas.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375.20 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Monday. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a late bid for gold at $375 an ounce, up 40 cents.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out stronger abroad,
then fell back after the release of data indicating continued
strength in the U.S. economy.
   The government said industrial production rose 0.7 percent in
March and consumer prices surged an unexpectedly sharp 0.5 percent
last month.
   While those figures would be considered bullish for the dollar,
since they spur higher interest rates, some traders said the market
thought the rise in inflation was too steep and could cause future
economic problems.
   Dealers said trading was quiet in anticipation of the release of
the February trade data Wednesday. The market has been expecting a
narrower trade gap of around $7.5 billion, down from January's
$9.25 billion shortfall, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar rose to 159.83
Japanese yen from 159.42 yen Monday. It stood at 159.85 yen in
London, and 159.685 yen in New York, up from Monday's close of
159.30.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought
$1.6340 in London, down from $1.6425 late Thursday, and $1.6383 in
New York, up from $1.6304 late Monday.
   The European markets were closed on Friday and Monday for the
Easter holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday
quotes, included: 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6778;
1.4895 Swiss francs, down from 1.4900; 5.6360 French francs, down
from 5.6365; 1,231.75 Italian lire, down from 1,232.50; and 1.16485
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16885.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.6770
marks, up from 1.6730; 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4835; 5.6370
French francs, up from 5.6213; 1.8885 Dutch guilders, up from
1.8840; 1,232.00 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50; and 1.1680
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $374.05 an ounce from
$375.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $374 an ounce from
$375.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at $375.39 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.093 a troy ounce, up 3.4
cents from late Monday. Silver fell in London to $5.07 an ounce
from $5.11 Thursday.

<HEAD>Value of Exports Doubled Last Decade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tobacco exports doubled in annual value in the
1980s, contributing nearly $25 billion to the U.S. trade ledger
over the decade, an industry report said Tuesday.
   The study, released by the Tobacco Merchants Association of the
United States, said exports increased to almost $5 billion in 1989
from $2.5 billion in 1980.
   ``Last year alone, while U.S. industry as a whole produced a
merchandize trade deficit of about $109 billion, the U.S. tobacco
industry contributed $4.2 billion to the positive side of the
nation's trade ledger,'' the association said.
   The association, in its 75th year, said it represents all
sectors of the tobacco industry, including growers, manufacturers,
suppliers, dealers, distributors, securities firms and management
consultants.
   Tobacco exports have come under fire from some U.S. health
authorities and others who contend it is wrong to push sales
overseas when Americans are being advised to quit smoking because
of health risks.
   Before he retired Oct. 1, then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
told Congress it was ``the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco.''
Koop had conducted a vigorous anti-smoking campaign while in office.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said American farmers and the U.S. economy benefit from the recent
upswing in tobacco exports.
   Kleckner, in a statement, said that increased sales of tobacco
leaf and products are a result of American farmers producing the
type of product wanted by foreign customers. He also cited the
removal of overseas trade barriers, primarily in Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea.

   Prices were mixed on Wall Street Tuesday after a
double dose of bad economic news as blue chip issues, repeating a
now-familiar pattern, recouped their losses to close the day with a
gain.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down nearly 25
points in early trading, closed up 2.71 at 2,765.77.
   The broader market stayed in negative territory throughout the
day. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5
to 4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 662 up, 844 down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a relatively light
127.99 million shares, down from 142.81 million the previous
session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 157.58 million shares.
   Prices were down across the board at the opening after the
government released two March economic indicators that triggered a
plunge on the bond market.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices soared an unexpectedly
high 0.5 percent last month, pushing the inflation rate for the
first three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight
years.
   Traders were particularly unnerved by a 0.7 percent rise in core
inflation _ prices excluding the volatile food and energy
categories.
   The government also reported industrial production rose 0.7
percent last month due in large part to increases in the output of
automobiles following a major cutback in January.
   Both reports punctured hopes that the Federal Reserve might
nudge interest rates lower. The Fed has been trying to keep
inflation in check and the economy from overheating by keeping
keeping rates relatively high.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down more than $10
per $1,000 face value for much of the day, and the losses in the
credit markets spilled over to stocks.
   But the blue chips, as they have done during a number of recent
sessions when there is bad economic news, gradually regained
ground, leaving the secondary stocks behind.
   This trend, known as a two-tier market, reflects trader caution.
While investors are looking to buy, they want to stay with stocks
perceived as the safest.
   Some analysts saw signs of strength in this pattern.
   ``The ability to come back shows we still have upside
momentum,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``There's still sideline cash that's
willing to buy stocks after a modest price decline.''
   Earnings reports influenced the performance of some stocks, most
notably NCR, which fell 5&rsqb; to 65&rsqb; and topped the NYSE most active
list after reporting a first-quarter profit decline.
   General Electric rose &lsqb; to 66~ after releasing results in line
with the market's expectations.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was up &lsqb; to 42, IBM rose \ to 111&lsqb;,
and Philip Morris picked up | to close at 43.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $688 million, or 0.02
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.03 to 188.91.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.13 to 400.29, while
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.06 to 344.68.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.28 to 435.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 354.72, down 2.26.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Drop In Market Correction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures fell sharply Tuesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange, reflecting what brokers called a market correction
after a sharp runup in prices in recent months.
   On other markets, precious metals were mixed; grains and
soybeans were mostly higher, energy futures were down, and
livestock and pork futures were mostly lower.
   Cocoa settled $42 to $50 lower with the contract for delivery in
May at $1,259.
   Cocoa futures had been rising because of concern over political
unrest in the Ivory Coast _ the world's largest cocoa producer _
and lack of rain in other producing countries in West Africa, and
in Brazil.
   Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said
Tuesday that emotions got ahead of facts in the runup of cocoa
prices _ more than $300 a ton off last fall's 14-year low of $900.
   She said the export of cocoa from the Ivory Coast was complete
when the unrest set in. Moreover, she said, recent rains have
helped Brazil and West Africa.
   ``The rally wasn't justified in the short term,'' she said. ``It
was time for a correction.''
   Precious metals futures declined on New York's Commodity
Exchange, as the dollar showed persistent strength against other
major currencies.
   William O'Neill, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New
York, said higher than expected inflation rate of the Consumer
Price Index released Tuesday had little effect on precious metals
prices.
   Many investors historically have turned to gold and silver as a
hedge against inflation.
   ``It (Tuesday's trading) showed that the only thing of
importance (to precious metals) is the dollar,'' O'Neill said.
   Gold was unchanged to 10 cents lower with April at $375.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 4.4 cents higher with May at
$5.108 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures were higher on the strength of soybean oil,
which posted contract highs from August and beyond.
   The bullish nature of soyoil is due to an expectation of tight
domestic stocks for the remainder of the 1989-1990 marketing year.
The National Oilseed Processor Association on Monday reported a
drop in its March soyoil stocks, a period when inventories usually
increase.
   Corn prices reached new contract highs due to concern over the
cold and wet weather in the corn belt that has delayed planting.
   Selling on the part of speculators sent old crop wheat futures
down sharply.
   Wheat was a \ cent to 5} cent lower with May at $3.64} a bushel;
corn was 1} cents to 3 cents higher with May at $2.74 a bushel;
oats were 4 cents to 5\ cents higher with May at $1.57} a bushel;
soybeans were 4{ cents to 6 cents higher with May at $5.96{ a
bushel.
   Energy futures declined on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
traders continued to show concern about the abundant supplies of
crude oil on the market.
   The price of crude was down despite Tuesday's meeting in Saudi
Arabia of the oil ministers of that country, Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates. The ministers are meeting on how to best reduce oil
production by 1 million barrels.
   Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York, said a meeting of OPEC ministers usually results in the
firming of the energy market, but that was not the case Tuesday.
   He said there is scepticism the three oil ministers will come up
a plan that would be acceptable to other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 41 cents lower to 6 cents
higher with May at $17.44 a bushel; heating oil was 52 cent lower
to .46 higher with May at 54.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolne
was .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May at 60.44 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Livestock futures were .35 cent lower to .08 cent higher with
April at 79.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to 53
cent lower with April at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .63
cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 56.45 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .60 cents lower to .20 cents higher with
May at 59.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>New Bedford Fishing Fleet Snags Most Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Bedford's fishing fleet pulled in
the most money of any port's fleet in the nation, the National
Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in Washington said Tuesday.
   While the New England port only ranked 13th in pounds of catch,
its fleet brought in $141 million worth of fish in 1989, said
Barbara O'Banon, administration statistician.
   The high amount of scallops caught at an average price of $4.14
per pound contributed to New Bedford's top-earner status.
   The New Bedford port has been named the top port for its dollar
catch four times in the last five years.
   Dutch Harbor, Alaska, brought in the most fish in 1989 with
504.3 million pounds. That port was also the second highest money
maker at $107 million.
   Other top moneymaking ports and their 1989 dollar totals are:
Kodiak, Alaska, $100.2 million; Petersburg, Alaska, $61.4 million,
and Kenia, Alaska, $56.5 million.
   Other top ports and their hauls in pounds are: Cameron, La.,
352.7 million; Pascagoola Moss Point, Miss., 282.1 million; Empire
Venice, La., 272.7 million; and Kodiak, Alaska, 213.2 million
pounds.
   New Bedford brought in 90.4 million pounds of fish in 1989.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Belo earnings. Picks up 4th

earnings.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc. Tuesday said its earnings tumbled 47 percent in
the first quarter in part because it has become more vulnerable to
seasonal swings in business since entering into a school publishing
venture.
   The New York-based diversified publishing and information
company reported revenue growth of 7.6 percent for the first three
months of this year.
   The Gannett Company, meanwhile, reported a barely perceptible
increase in first-quarter earnings. It said a sluggish consumer
economy and restructuring in the retail industry combined to
produce the poorest advertising environment in almost 20 years.
   Another media company, Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corporation, said
its net income was up about 16 percent from last year as revenue
rose due to higher classified advertising volume and a boost in
broadcast revenue from state primary election campaigns.
   McGraw-Hill earned $16.49 million, or 34 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 31, down sharply from $31.17 million, or
64 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of
McGraw-Hill, said the formation last year of a joint venture school
publishing company, which was a major investment for the company,
has increased business seasonality.
   The Macmillan_McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. posted a loss in
the first quarter, as expected. But Dionne said McGraw-Hill's share
of the loss was smaller than expected and it is anticipated that
full-year results will be fine.
   Last year's quarterly income was boosted by a one-time $8
million gain associated with a change in accounting procedures.
There also was a lower tax rate in the first 1989 quarter than in
this year's first quarter.
   One of McGraw-Hill's publications is Business Week magazine. It
also has publications in various other specialized fields and
broadcast interests.
   Gannett, headquartered in Arlington, Va., said earnings totaled
$75 million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 1, up
slightly from $74.9 million, or 47 cents a share, the prior year.
   Revenue slipped less than 1 percentage point to $813.4 million
from $817.6 million a year earlier.
   The company blamed the downturn on a loss in advertising
revenue. Newspaper advertising revenue declined by 3 percent in the
fist quarter.
   Gannett said broadcast revenue also was lower, but no figures
were provided.
   Gannett, a nationwide news and information company, publishes 83
daily newspapers, and 52 non-daily publications. Besides publishing
USA Today, the company operates 10 television stations, 16 radio
stations and Gannett News Services.
   Belo posted a profit of $2.8 million, or 14 cents a share, in
the first three months of the year compared with $2.4 million, or
12 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Revenue rose to $56.3 million from $53.6 million reported in
last year's first quarter.
   Belo owns and operates The Dallas Morning News, seven community
newspapers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and five televsion
stations in several states.

<HEAD>Restaurant Chain Battles McDonalds Over Texas Burger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE JACKSON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It could be called a case of Texas
hamburglary.
   But to Lake Jackson restaurateur Richard Cox, the flap over
McDonald's ``Texas Homestyle Burger'' is no laughing matter.
   ``We have been using the Texas burger concept for 17 years,''
said Cox, owner of the Red Top restaurant chain that features
``Texas Style Burgers.''
   ``They copied everything we did,'' Cox, 45, said Monday. ``They
thought it was a good idea and went ahead and used it, and they
didn't think anyone would challenge them.''
   Cox has sued and has obtained an injunction against McDonald's
using the name in ads in his end of Brazoria County until June 4,
when the case is to be tried.
   The man who heads the corporation that owns the six McDonald's
in the county is doing some challenging of his own.
   ``He is trying to portray himself as a small independent
businessman run over by a large corporation,'' said Robert D.
Humason Sr. of Lake Jackson. ``He's fighting me. I'm down here
struggling with six stores.''
   Humason heads Dewey Corp., which owns the McDonald's restaurants
in Brazoria County, south of Houston.
   Cox, who owns six Red Top restaurants in Brazoria County and one
in Houston, said the McDonald's ad campaign for their burger is
almost identical to his Texas Style Burger.
   In a petition, McDonald's denied using Cox's concept, saying its
promotion relies on generic logos that don't belong to Cox.
   Humason said Cox didn't have the marketing concept registered
and does not hold sole rights to the three words in contention.
   Cox said the McDonald's ads are so similar that confused
customers have brought McDonald's coupons to Red Top.
   But Humason said of 174,000 coupons distributed during the
marketing drive, only three were mistakenly taken to Red Top
restaurants.

<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday reported record
third-quarter revenues and a 83 percent increase in earnings from
the same period a year earlier.
   The computer software giant said it earned $310.9 million for
the quarter that ended March 31, a 58 percent increase over the
$197 million for the same period a year earlier. Earnings totaled
$75.2 million or 62 cents a share vs. $41.1 million or 36 cents a
share.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, revenues were
$846.5 million, 45 percent over the $583.3 million recorded one
year earlier. Earnings for the three quarters of fiscal 1990 rose
59 percent to $199.2 million or $1.69 a share, compared with $125.2
million or $1.12 a share for the corresponding period of fiscal
1989.
   Jon Shirley, president and chief operating officer, said the
record quarterly revenue was the result of continuing strength in
all facets of Microsoft's operations.
   ``The international part of our business was strong and
represented 58 percent of this quarter's revenue,'' he said. ``In
the product area, the Microsoft Word family was particularly
strong.''
   Microsoft develops, markets and supports a wide range of
computer software for business and professional use, including
operating systems, language and application programs.

   United Telecommunications Inc. said
Tuesday it will buy the remaining 19.9 percent of US Sprint and
change its name to Sprint Corp. to cash in on the high profile of
its long-distance subsidiary.
   United Telecom also reported a 41 percent rise in first quarter
profits, but it said revenue growth was slower than expected at US
Sprint and that competition was intensifying from rivals AT&amp;T and
MCI.
   US Sprint was formed in 1986 as a joint venture of United
Telecom and GTE Corp. It is now the nation's No. 3 long-distance
company with 8 percent of the market.
   United Telecom bought a controlling interest in 1988 and was
given an option to buy the remaining 19.9 percent.
   The company will notify GTE by the end of May that it is ready
to exercise the option and take full control, William Esrey,
chairman and CEO, told Telecom shareholders at Tuesday's annual
meeting in this Kansas City, Mo., suburb.
   The agreed selling price is about $500 million, Telecom
spokesman Jerry Cosley said.
   Esrey said United Telecom's name would change July 1, when the
transaction with GTE is expected to be completed. Shareholders
approved the name change at the meeting.
   ``It's obviously not without some mixed emotions,'' retiring
Chairman Paul Henson told shareholders. ``We think that Sprint
Corporation tells the financial community more clearly what we are
about. In addition, it has very high public recognition.''
   The company also will shorten the long-distance subsidiary's
name to Sprint, reflecting its attempts to expand overseas, Esrey
said. Telecom's local telephone service subsidiaries, such as
United Telephone of Kansas, will remain unchanged.
   Sprint's revenues were $1.2 billion in the first quarter vs.
$984 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 22
percent. But revenues increased only about 2 percent from the last
quarter of 1989, less than the 4 percent to 6 percent forecast by
company officials, Cosley said.
   ``This is an area that we are somewhat disappointed in, and that
we are addressing,'' Esrey told stockholders.
   Cosley said some revenues from contracts already won by Sprint
simply did not materialize during the quarter as expected because
equipment wasn't installed. ``But those revenues will show up down
the road,'' he said.
   Esrey told shareholders Sprint will introduce about 55 new
products this year as competition in the long-distance market heats
up. He noted that both American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI
Communications Inc. are developing fiber-optic telephone networks
similar to the one Sprint built a few years ago and now touts in
its advertising.
   ``Day-by-day, that advantage tends to shrink on us,'' Esrey
said. ``We must now use our system to help us develop new
products.''
   He said the company would consider buying smaller long-distance
companies as MCI did recently when it bought Telecom USA Inc. of
Atlanta, the fourth-largest U.S. long-distance carrier. But Esrey
said Telecom would proceed with caution.
   ``Certainly, if we can acquire customers by buying them, cheaper
than we can through other ways, we will do it,'' he said.
   United Telecom said it earned $107.6 million or 51 cents a share
on revenues of $2.02 billion in the first quarter, compared with
$76.4 million or 36 cents a share on revenues of 1.77 billion a
year earlier.
   The company's stock closed 25 cents lower at $39.87{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Also at the meeting, Henson, who had announced his retirement
more than a year ago, officially stepped down after 31 years. He
came to the company in 1959 as a vice president, was named
president in 1964 and chairman in 1966. He is given much credit for
helping to form Sprint in the mid-1980s.

<HEAD>Inventor Seeks Damages in Windshield-Wiper Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors who decided Ford Motor Co. stole the
intermittent windshield-wiper design from its inventor now must
consider how much the automaker should pay in damages.
   Maryland inventor Robert W. Kearns said he showed the windshield
wiper to Ford engineers in 1962, detailing the system in an attempt
to sell it to the company. Ford has sold about 20.5 million
vehicles equipped with the Kearns-design wiper system.
   ``This phase of the trial is going to deal with two issues:
damages and whether or not Ford's infringement was willful,'' U.S.
District Judge Avern Cohn told jurors as the trial's damage phase
opened Tuesday.
   Cohn instructed the jury to make its decision on an award amount
based solely on the reasonable royalty due Kearns, disregarding any
interest or legal fees incurred during his 12-year-old suit.
   In the opening arguments, attorneys for both Kearns and Ford
presented different interpretations of how the jury should figure
royalties.
   Kearns' attorney Paul Janicke told the eight-person jury that
Kearns deserves 25 percent to 42 percent of Ford's profits from the
device, or between $193 million and $325 million.
   ``But what is normally done when licensing patents in the auto
industry is they tend to do things to the inventors rather than for
them. There isn't reasonable compensation at all,'' Janicke said.
   Ford attorney Malcolm Wheeler denied that the automaker
knowingly duped the inventor, saying its engineers believed they
had developed the system themselves.
   ``When the jury returned the decision that Ford had infringed on
the patents, that came as quite a blow,'' he said, referring to the
Jan. 29 jury verdict. ``Ford's engineers did not act like people
who thought they were stealing Mr. Kearns' designs.''
   But the jury decided the Ford system was similar enough to
Kearns' that it constituted patent violation. The Kearns system
combines three elements _ an electric wiper motor, a driver switch
and a control module _ all of which were included in the Ford
version.
   Kearns also sued General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp.,
Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and 21 other companies,
claiming each has infringed on his patent. The Ford suit was the
first to go trial.
   Kearns, a former resident of Detroit suburb River Rouge who now
lives in Gaithersburg, Md., claimed the automakers violated patents
he obtained between 1967-74.

   Polaroid Corp. said Tuesday that
first-quarter profit climbed 22.8 percent but sales declined
slightly in a lackluster business environment.
   The photography giant reported net income of $31.8 million, or
43 cents per share, in the three months ended April 1, up from
$25.9 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same 1989 quarter.
   Polaroid said last year's first-quarter earnings were depressed
because of expenses related to fending off a hostile takeover
attempt by Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   Polaroid said worldwide sales in the first quarter fell to $436
million from $442 million a year earlier.
   ``The general worldwide business environment has been slower
than expected,'' Polaroid President and Chief Executive I.
MacAllister Booth said in a statement.
   ``This, in combination with increased marketing expenses related
to our long-term growth strategy, is reflected in our first-quarter
results,'' he added.
   Booth said the company had lowered its expectations for 1990 but
still believed it would show moderate growth in sales and operating
profit for the year.
   Polaroid said first-quarter operating profits were $65.4
million, up from $34.9 million a year earlier. The year-ago figure
reflected $38.5 million in expenses related to Shamrock's takeover
bid.
   Polaroid supplies instant photography, cameras and films, as
well as conventional films, videotapes and electronic visual
communication products to family, business and technical and
industrial markets.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices tumbled to their lowest
levels in 14 months Tuesday as traders dumped futures contracts on
the belief that sluggish short-term demand will do little to reduce
abundant supplies.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange closed mixed.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, slid 41 cents to $17.44 per
42-gallon barrel after inching up 7 cents on Monday. That was the
lowest closing price for the near-month contract since West Texas
Intermediate finished below $17 a barrel in February 1989,
according to Elders Futures Inc.
   The June, July and August crude contracts posted smaller losses.
The near-month contract took the hardest hit partly because traders
assumed that any effort OPEC might make to cut world oil supplies
would come too late to benefit the May contract, which expires
Friday.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline rebounded
0.23 cent to 60.44 cents a gallon after losing 1.66 cents on
Monday. Contracts for delivery in June and July settled unchanged
from Monday's closing levels while the August contract ended with a
small drop.
   Among other refined petroleum products traed on the Merc, home
heating oil for May delivery dropped 0.52 to 54.20 cents a gallon,
wiping out much of Monday's gain of 0.89 cent. Later contracts were
mixed.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery settled at $1.585 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.598 on Monday. Most
later contracts finished higher.
   Energy market analysts said the selloff in crude reflected a
bearish supply and demand situation. A meeting of three OPEC
ministers to discuss price weakness didn't produce any tangible
results, analysts said.
   It is generally assumed that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will not undertake a radical production-cutting

weekly statistics due late Tuesday after the markets closed would
show another large buildup in crude inventory.

<HEAD>First-Quarter Earnings Surge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Tuesday that
first-quarter earnings from continuing operations increased 63.5
percent, in part because of strong performances by its industrial
and commercial flight systems divisions.
   Honeywell said net income rose to $83.4 million, or $2.12 per
share, in the three months ended April 1 from $51 million, or $1.18
per share, in the 1989 first quarter.
   The earnings include an after-tax gain of $18.1 million, or 46
cents per share, from the sale of Yamatake-Honeywell shares, the
company said in a statement.
   Earnings from discontinued operations totaled $6.7 million, or
17 cents per share, compared with $11.9 million, or 28 cents per
share, in the first quarter of last year.
   Worldwide sales from continuing operations were $1.53 billion,
up from $1.43 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
   Honeywell is provides products, systems and services for homes
and buildings, industry, and aviation and space. The company had
total 1989 sales of $6.1 billion.
   Honeywell said total company orders in first-quarter were flat.
Excluding results from businesses sold in 1989, orders increased 4
percent.

   Warner-Lambert Co. said Tuesday its
first-quarter earnings rose 19 percent on an 8 percent sales
increase.
   The health care and consumer products company said its earnings
increased to $120 million, or $1.79 a share, from $101 million, or
$1.49 a share, during the same period in 1989.
   Worldwide sales increased to $1.10 billion from $1.02 billion in
the same period last year.
   Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive, said all of
the company's business segments contributed to Warner-Lambert's
first-quarter growth.
   During the quarter, worldwide sales of the company's
pharmaceutical products rose 10 percent to $359 million, while
sales of non-prescription health care products increased 4 percent
to $355 million.
   Chewing gum sales went up 9 percent to $250 million, while
Warner-Lambert's other products grew 12 percent to $137 million in

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. on Tuesday reported an 8
percent increase in first-quarter profit, citing strong
performances by its telephone and other telecommunications
businesses.
   Net income was $355 million, or $1.05 per share, up from $329
million, or 97 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1989, the
company said.
   Revenue and sales were $4.5 billion in the three-months ending
March 31, up 9 percent from $4.1 billion in the same period last
year.
   GTE said revenue and sales from its telecommunications
businesses rose 37 percent to $798 million. It attributed the
increase to greater sales of government communications systems,
cellular-mobile phone services and directory advertising.
   During the quarter, GTE received an $879 million contract for
continued communications work for the U.S. Army.
   GTE said revenue from its telephone operations increased 5
percent to $3.2 billion. It said revenue rose despite a voluntary
$101 million annual reduction in the rates charged certain carriers
for access to GTE's local networks.
   The Jan. 1 reduction, along with a similar reduction last April,
reduced revenue and operating income by $50 million.
   Sales of electrical products increased 3 percent, while
operating income decreased 8 percent because of competitive
pricing, lower results overseas and a softening in the automotive
industry.
   ``I expect results from our lighting operations to improve as
the benefits from the restructuring program initiated last year
take hold,'' said James L. Johnson, GTE's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The restructuring will close two lighting plants and 17
warehouses and streamline the company's product delivery network.

<HEAD>McDonald's to Buy Recycled Goods to Build U.S. Restaurants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA HALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday it would seek to
substitute recycled materials for at least 25 percent of the goods
needed to build, remodel and equip its U.S. restaurants.
   The program _ dubbed McRecycle USA _ would create the nation's
largest new market for recycled materials, the company said.
   ``We're the largest user of recycled paper products in the
quick-service restaurant business,'' said Shelby Yastrow,
McDonald's senior vice president of environmental affairs.
   ``Now, we're prepared to use our purchasing power to stimulate
demand for a wide range of products made from recycled materials.''
   Pressure has been building on fast-food and soft-drink companies
in recent years to promote recycling because of the large quantity
of trash they generate.
   McDonald's said its initial goal calls for spending $100 million
a year on recycled products for its restaurants, or 25 percent of
annual expenditures.
   Each year, McDonald's builds about 375 restaurants and remodels
1,000 in the United States. Products used include building
insulation, timber, table tops, waste containers, wallboard and
roofing materials.
   Ed Rensi, president of McDonald's USA, said in a statement that
the $100 million target is in addition to more than $60 million the
company already spends annually on recycled paper products such as
napkins and drink carriers.
   Richard Denison, senior scientist for the non-profit
Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, called McDonald's plan
``a significant step forward'' but said it should be ``just one
step in a larger overhaul of their own operation.''
   ``I think it demonstrates McDonald's willingness to take a
leadership position on solid-waste issues,'' Denison said.
   ``I would hope that this is seen as something that would be
emulated by other companies, not only fast-food companies but also
other large chains in other areas _ for example retail stores and
the like.''
   In its announcement, McDonald's noted that last fall it began a
recycling program for polystyrene food-packaging in 450 restaurants
in New England. The company said it plans to expand the program to
all its 8,200 U.S. restaurants ``as quickly as projected recycling
facilities are opened.''
   The announcement is intended to encourage companies to build
more centers to recycle polystyrene, said Chuck Rubner, assistant
vice president for McDonald's.

<HEAD>Merc Members Vote on Dual Trading Restrictions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with vote approving proposed
restrictions; picks up 10th graf pvs, `Congress also ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange voted
Tuesday to approve restrictions on the dual-trading of certain
contracts as a proposed alternative to a federal crackdown on the
practice.
   Dual trading, in which floor brokers trade for their own
accounts and their customers' at the same time, is among practices
the government investigated in a probe of suspected trading abuses
at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade _ the nation's largest
futures exchanges.
   It has long been considered a legitimate practice, but critics
say it leads to the temptation of front-running, an illegal
procedure in which traders try to make a profit trading for
themselves ahead of their customers.
   The Merc and Board of Trade maintain that dual trading provides
much of the market's liquidity.
   But the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal
regulator of the futures markets, has proposed a partial ban on
dual trading with an eye toward a possible total ban.
   The Merc's proposal would basically ban dual trading in the most
heavily traded contract months, but would allow it in less active
contract months for each commodity.
   The Merc said 76 percent of the 1,561 ballots cast favored the
restrictions, which were drawn up by an exchange committee and
approved recently by board of governors. The exchange has 2,500
active members.
   The Merc will ask the CFTC to accept the newly approved proposal
in lieu of the agency's plan.
   The CFTC is expected to make a final determination on dual
trading this summer, exchange spokesman Andrew Yemma said.
   Congress also is considering dual-trading restrictions that
would potentially be more severe than those proposed by the Merc.
   The Merc's proposed restrictions were recommended by a committee
that reviewed trading practices in light of the government probe,
in which 48 people, mostly traders, have been indicted, Yemma said.
   The Merc's proposal would involve ``the most heavily traded
contract months but it will not affect the lightly traded months
which need the liquidity that dual trading provides,'' Yemma said.
   The exchange believes those contracts are more easily monitored
because they are less active, he said.
   For example, in the Merc's pork belly futures pit, contracts are
currently traded for delivery in May, July, August and February.
Under the Merc's proposal, dual trading would be allowed for
contracts in the more distant months, which tend to be less active.
Even before the government probe was revealed last year, the Merc
banned dual trading in 1987 for 90 percent of the trades in its
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit, Yemma said.
   ``There was a feeling among members in the pit that there were
abuses of dual trading that needed to be addressed,'' he said.
   But Yemma said the Merc opposes the CFTC plan because it does
``not take into account the vital role that dual trading plays in
fostering liquidity in back months and lightly traded contracts.''
   The Chicago Board of Trade also believes the CFTC proposal goes
too far, said Board of Trade spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   There currently are no restrictions on dual trading at the Board
of Trade, and officials there want to keep it that way, O'Connell
said.

<HEAD>Ameritech Quarterly Earnings Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ameritech said its earnings in the first quarter
were nearly flat because of the cost of job cuts at the Midwest
Baby Bell.
   American Information Technologies Corp. said earnings were
$303.5 million, or $1.13 a share, compared with profits of $300.8
million, or $1.12 a share, in the first three months of 1989.
Revenue increased 4.7 percent to $2.6 billion from $2.5 billion.
   The company, which provides telephone service in five Midwestern
states, said earnings were affected by one-time expenses of about
$54 million related to workforce cuts.
   Early retirement incentives were used to trim 1,265 jobs at
Illinois Bell and Michigan Bell. Ameritech also is the parent of
local Bell companies in Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Del Monte Foods to Sell European Foods Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Del Monte Foods has agreed to sell its
European processed foods division to an investor group for $355
million in cash and assumed debt.
   The group is led by affiliates of Charterhouse PLC of Britain
and members of Del Monte's European division, known as DMFE, Del
Monte said Tuesday.
   Del Monte has been selling assets to pay off debt acquired in
January when the company was bought from RJR Nabisco for $1.47
billion by its managers and an investor group led by Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co.
   That sale, in turn, was designed to help RJR pay off debt
incurred when the company was taken private in a record $24.53
billion buyout led by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co.
   The sale of the European operation and other recent divestitures
``were contemplated in the financing arrangements leading to the
Jan. 9 acquisition,'' said Dr. Robert J. Carbonell, chairman and
chief executive officer of Del Monte Foods.
   ``Our divestiture program is substantially ahead of the original
timetable,'' he said.
   Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. purchased Del Monte's Hawaiian Punch
beverage business for $150 million in late January.
   Del Monte also has sold its Far East business, excluding the
Philippines, to Kikkoman Corp. of Japan for $110 million.

<HEAD>Scott Paper Reports Drop In Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scott Paper Co. said its earnings dropped 31
percent in the first three months of 1990, in part because of the
costs of expanding the company's printing and publishing papers
business.
   Higher interest expenses and ``shortfalls'' in the company's
food service business also contributed to the decline, the company
said Tuesday.
   Net profit in the period totaled $60.1 million, or 82 cents a
share, compared with $86.5 million, or $1.12, in the first quarter
of 1989. Sales rose 2 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.27 billion.
   Sales at S.D. Warren's printing and publishing papers business
were down 2 percent and income declined 31 percent in the first
quarter, reflecting the costs of major capital projects at
Muskegon, Mich., and Skowhegan, Maine.
   Scott Chairman and chief executive officer Philip E. Lippincott
said those two projects ``are part of a very aggressive expansion
program being undertaken around the world, where in 1989 and 1990
the company is starting up 10 new or rebuilt paper machines, nine
this year.''
   Increased capital spending and the purchase in 1989 of the
company's common stock warrants boosted debt and led to higher
interest expenses, the company said.
   Lippincott said overseas subsidiaries reported an 8 percent
increase in sales and 18 percent gain in income in the quarter,
primarily because of improvement in the Pacific region.
   Earnings from Scott's U.S. tissue business, its largest
division, were up 7 percent.

<HEAD>Ex-Banker Gets 2 Years in Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former junior bank official was sentenced to
two years in prison and fined $25,000 for his conviction on 86
counts of wire and mail fraud in an insider trading scheme.
   Danny Omar Cherif, 35, a former assistant vice president at
First National Bank of Chicago, also was sentenced to three years
on special release and 300 hours of community service by U.S.
District Judge James B. Moran.
   Federal prosecutors said Cherif returned to the bank after he
was fired in 1987, gaining entry with an old bank key card he had
tricked bank security officials into reactivating.
   Prosecutors charged Cherif copied documents from the bank's
leveraged buyout division, acquiring non-public information on
mergers and acquisitions in which the bank was involved.
   Cherif subsequently bought and sold stock in four companies,
making $230,000 for himself and several thousand dollars for
relatives and friends, prosecutors said.
   Cherif became a stockbroker for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
after he was fired from First National, but he lost that job after
his indictment.
