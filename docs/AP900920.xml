   Barring unforeseen calamities, the Jewish New
Year is looking happier than usual for Israel.
   The caveat about calamities is necessary.
   When Jews celebrate, they traditionally smash a glass to remind
themselves there is no joy without sorrow. And with each puff of
good fortune, Israelis listen for the tinkle of broken glass.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, the rapid thaw in Israel's relations
with Moscow and the influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants are forcing
Israelis to confront the unimaginable. The sands of the Middle East
haven't just shifted. They have quaked.
   ``The horizon that has opened up is unlimited and we're playing
for the whole kitty,'' says Amnon Abramovitz, a columnist for the
Maariv newspaper.
   ``We're at a junction of several roads, and it's hard to know
right now what road we'll be taking this year. It could lead to
negotiations with Syria, or a war with Saddam Hussein, or both,''
he said.
   Israel's steadfast, low-profile conduct in the gulf crisis has
transformed its image from bully of the West Bank to loyal ally of
the West, and relieved the pressure on Jerusalem to negotiate with
the Palestinians.
   Still Israelis worry: What if Iraq attacks them with chemical
weapons? There was panic buying of survival supplies last month,
and a debate is raging about whether to distribute gas masks.
   Soviet Jewish newcomers kissing the Tarmac at Ben-Gurion Airport
are a heart-warming spectacle for Israelis - a reminder of why they
built a Jewish state.
   But can a small, troubled economy pay to house and employ an
immigrant multitude that may increase the Jewish population by 50
percent by the mid-1990s?
   ``It is a most revolutionary thing,'' says immigration official
Simcha Dinitz. ``I know of no other society going through such a
massive absorption process.''
   Many of Israel's 7,000 synagogues opened to immigrants free,
following a request by Minister of Religious Affairs Avner Shaki to
waive the fees that some synagogues impose to raise funds for
religious work.
   The new year, 5751 on the Jewish calendar, was welcomed with the
blowing of the ram's horn known as the shofar and begins 10 days of
introspection which culminate in Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
   According to figures released Wednesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics, Israel's Jewish population grew by 3.9 percent since
last Rosh Hashana. Of the 115,000 new immigrants, 88 percent were
from the Soviet Union.
   State-owned radio reports a nearly 10 percent unemployment rate.
   The intefadeh, the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, has slowed sharply, but no
Israeli imagines it is over.
   ``Once the dust has settled, when the gulf has calmed down,
there will still be two peoples left in this country - two people
whose lives will become hell unless the conflict between them is
solved by peaceful means,'' warned Peace Now, a grass-roots Israeli
movement, in a New Year message.
   Still, as they take to the synagogues, beaches and picnic
grounds for a long weekend starting Wednesday night, many Israelis
will agree with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's assessment that
``we had a great year and we're entering an even greater one.''
   Most extraordinary is the turnaround by the Soviets, who had
armed the Arabs, denounced Zionism as Nazism and persecuted
would-be Jewish emigrants. The Soviets now line up with the United
States against Iraq and entertained Israeli ministers in the
Kremlin.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Science Minister Yuval Neeman
on Saturday became the first Israeli Cabinet ministers to meet a
Soviet leader.
   Asked how he felt as he walked into the Kremlin to meet
Gorbachev, 64-year-old Modai replied in awe-struck tones not heard
from Israeli politicians since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
landed in Israel 13 years ago.
   ``You can't even imagine. It was so dramatic. It was so out of
anything that any normal human mind can conceive, that I don't
think anybody who hasn't gone through it can imagine it.
   ``We were frozen there on our seats. You sit across from
Gorbachev. You can touch him. You look at his face and that famous
mark. And you (are able to) read his mind, not just to listen to
him,'' he said.
   A year ago, Iraq was a distant threat. Jordan looked like
Israel's most peaceful and responsible neighbor, and Syria, as
ever, was Israel's implacable foe.
   Now Jordan is drifting into Iraq's embrace and readmitting the
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders it expelled 20 years ago,
while Syria sends troops to join the Western buildup in the gulf.
   And now that the Soviets no longer guarantee to bankroll Syria's
army, some Israelis are speculating about a tradeoff involving the
Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. A year ago the notion of peace with
Syria would have been laughed off. Now the Jewish settlers on the
northern Golan Heights are calling emergency meetings to discuss
the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal.
   In Saudi Arabia, the U.S. military staged private services
Wednesday for Jewish troops wishing to mark the holiday despite
Saudi restrictions on overt practice of any religion other than
Islam.
   ``All these things simply make you lose your bearings,'' says
Amnon Dankner, a writer and columnist for the daily Hadashot.

   Paramilitary game rangers killed four
poachers, wounded and captured two more and seized the horns of
nine rhinos in a gunbattle at a nature preserve, officials say.
   Chief warden Rodwell Ngwarai said Wednesday that the clash
occurred about 240 miles northwest of Harare on Sept. 10 and that
later patrols led to Tuesday's capture of a sixth member of the
poachers' gang.
   The poachers were believed to have crossed into Zimbabwe from
neighboring Zambia, he said.
   Ngwarai said the Zimbabwe rangers seized 18 rhino horns, two
rhino ears, one elephant tail and two automatic assault rifles.
   The endangered black rhinoceros has one large horn on its snout,
with a smaller one behind it.
   The horns are carved into ornamental dagger handles or crushed
into powder as an ingredient in traditional medicines in the Middle
East and Asia.
   The world's largest surviving black rhino population of about
2,000 lives in Zimbabwe.
   So far this year, anti-poaching patrols have killed 28 poachers
and captured 14. Most have been Zambians.

<HEAD>Two Students Attempt Self-Immolation to Protest Job Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To protest a new government plan to set
aside 49 percent of federal jobs for India's most disadvantaged
castes, two college students sprinkled kerosene on their bodies and
set themselves on fire.
   Rajeev Goswami, an undergraduate, was taken to the hospital with
severe burns after Wednesday's suicide attempt outside the
capital's Deshbandhu Gupta College, United News of India said.
   The second student was taken to the hospital but was later
discharged, news reports said. He was subsequently arrested, they
said.
   Elsewhere in the capital, graduate students blocked traffic and
burned their college degrees to protest the job quotas.
   In Solan, in the Himalayan foothills north of New Delhi, at
least 60 people were injured when opponents of the policy battled
police, United News said.
   At least one person sustained bullet njuries when police opened
fire after repeated charges failed to quell the crowd, it said.
   The job policy, announced by Prime Minister V.P. Singh on Aug.
7, reserves 49 percent of all government jobs for India's most
disadvantaged castes and another 5 to 10 percent for the poor,
irrespective of caste.
   Remaining jobs will be awarded on merit.
   The government employs 18 million people and a white-collar job
is much sought after by most college graduates.
   At least 25 people have died in protests by upper caste students
since the quotas were announced. They say the policy will lessen
job opportunities, heighten caste tensions and lead to the
recruitment of unqualified people.
   The government says the program will bring more social justice
for the mainly poor lower castes.
   Hindus, 82 percent of India's 880 million people, are divided
into four main castes, or social levels, and hundreds of
sub-castes. Although discrimination on the basis of caste is
illegal, the system permeates much of Indian life, especially in
rural areas.
   Singh's opponents say the quotas are a political gimmick aimed
at gathering votes from the lower castes, who form a majority of
the population.

<HEAD>Experts Uncertain What Role Souter Would Play on High Court</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX8</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Supreme Court nominee David H.
Souter's confirmation seems assured, there still is uncertainty on
what kind of high court justice he would be or what historic role
he would play.
   Would he bolster the court's slim conservative majority, or
would Souter prove to be a moderate whose pivotal vote in key cases
might be up for grabs?
   The high stakes riding on the answer to that question account
for the intense scrutiny President Bush's selection of Souter
attracted.
   ``It would not matter who was nominated at this moment in our
history,'' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said of the controversy swirling about Souter as his
confirmation hearings concluded Wednesday.
   The next justice will join a court confronting ``a number of
significant decisions that are now 4-4,'' Biden said.
   The hearings focused on divisive issues including abortion,
civil rights, church-state relations and free speech.
   Where would Souter fit in?
   ``It's difficult to put him in anybody's camp,'' Nan Aron of the
liberal Alliance for Justice said in an interview.
   The difficulty, in part, arises from the differences between
Souter's record of public service and the testimony he offered in
three days before Biden's committee.
   His appearance undermined pre-hearing beliefs some held that the
nominee, a lifelong bachelor, is some kind of bookish hermit with
no friends or real-life experiences.
   Several of Souter's best friends took him out for a 51st
birthday party the day he finished testifying. The next night, he
traveled to Baltimore to watch a major league baseball game.
   Ms. Aron said Souter's views on women's rights make him sound
like conservative Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and his views
on church-state relations like slightly less conservative Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   ``He doesn't seem to be another (Justice) Antonin Scalia, who
has the clearest conservative agenda,'' Ms. Aron said. ``On civil
rights, people are hoping he is a (moderate retired Justice Lewis
F.) Powell.''
   Thomas Jipping of the conservative Coalitions for America
likened Souter to another member of the court, Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy.
   ``While Scalia is a well-developed, philosophical conservative,
Souter more resembles Kennedy in that he's a prudent, instinctive
conservative,'' Jipping said in an interview.
   In nearly three years on the court, Kennedy has sided with
Rehnquist in about 90 percent of all cases. Are liberals facing a
similar performance by a Justice Souter? ``I hope so,'' said
Jipping. ``They're certainly going to have some sleepless nights.''
   Some predict Souter, whose nomination likely will be voted on by
the judiciary committee a week from today, may betray the
conservative credentials he earned in 12 years as a New Hampshire
judge.
   Griffin Bell, the Democrat who served as attorney general in
Jimmy Carter's administration, called Souter ``rather moderate'' in
endorsing his nomination.
   Former Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles called him ``moderate in
tone and expression,'' and suggested that he might emulate retired
Justice Powell.
   But Sara Rios of the Center for Constitutional Rights, who
Wednesday urged the Senate to reject Souter, called his
moderate-sounding testimony ``a confirmation conversion.''
   ``He bandied about liberal rhetoric with great facility'' but
his record does not hold out much hope he will vote that way, Ms.
Rios said.
   Testifying in another context, Souter's longtime friend Wesley
Williams, a Washington lawyer, uttered a question appropriate to
the Souter guessing game: ``Who can read the heart of a man?''

<HEAD>Luxury, Energy Taxes Eyed to Finance War Against Deficit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Washington was barely into his second
year as president when the government slapped a tax on whiskey.
Cigarettes were targeted during the Civil War. Furs and other
luxuries were taxed to help finance World War I.
   Now Congress and the Bush administration are eyeing those
products and others in the search for revenues with which to fight
a new war - the long-running battle against the budget deficit.
   Despite lingering disagreement over several deficit-reduction
proposals, chiefly President Bush's plan to cut taxes on capital
gains, negotiators for Congress and the White House have agreed
tentatively on a half-dozen tax increases that would affect million
of Americans.
   The federal government faces $100 billion worth of arbitrary
cuts in most programs Oct. 1 - barely a month before elections -
unless a deficit reduction plan can be enacted.
   The leaders have agreed tentatively to these tax increases:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>LUXURIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   They want to restore an old standby - the luxury tax - whose
last remnants were repealed in 1965. The World War I version
applied to jewelry, furs, cosmetics and luggage. The proposal would
redefine luxuries to accommodate the electronics age.
   Specifically, the plan would raise $9 billion over the next five
years by imposing a 10 percent levy on part of the cost of certain
luxuries. The tax would apply only to the portion of the purchase
price that exceeds $30,000 for cars and boats; $1,000 for
electronics; $5,000 for jewelry, and $500 for furs. The tax would
hit private planes under 5,000 pounds regardless of price.
   For example, the buyer of a $32,000 car would have to pay a $200
tax; a $2,000 stereo system would cost an extra $100.

   The budget-writers agree that energy taxes should be increased,
but there is no agreement on specifics. Democrats are seeking a
higher and broader tax on most energy, costing consumers $49
billion over five years; the GOP plan would cost $7 billion.
   Regardless of which side prevails, one result will be higher
prices on gasoline and home heating oil.

   Airline passengers and cargo shippers would feel the pinch if
the budget agreement becomes law. Negotiators have accepted an
administration plan to keep several air taxes from dropping as
scheduled at year-end and to raise some of them.
   This would mean, for example, that the 8 percent tax on
passenger tickets would rise to 10 percent; a $500 round-trip
ticket would cost $10 more.

<BYLINE>CIGARETTES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The tax on a pack of cigarettes would rise by 4 cents, to 20
cents, next year and by an additional 4 cents in 1993. This would
cost smokers $5.9 billion over five years.
   The tobacco tax was raised from 7 cents to 8 cents in 1951 and
stayed at that level until it was doubled in 1983. Republicans
especially are wary of raising the tax this year because two GOP
senators from tobacco states - Jesse Helms of North Carolina and
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - are in tight re-election races.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ALCOHOL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal taxes on wine and beer remain at 1951 levels, although
the tax on liquor was raised in 1951 and again in 1985. While
negotiators have not said exactly how it will be done, they have
agreed to tax drinkers an extra $13.6 billion over the next five
years.
   The plan is expected to increase taxes somewhat less than an
earlier proposal, which, for example, would have raised the $1.96
tax on a fifth of 80-proof vodka to $2.54; the 16-cent tax on a
six-pack of beer to 81 cents and the 3-cent levy on a
750-milliliter bottle of table wine to 76 cents.
   However, rank-and-file members of both parties are getting
nervous about the budget negotiations, which moved back to the
Capitol this week after 10 days of talks at Andrews Air Force Base
ended in stalemate.
   ``There is very little sentiment for continuing on this path for
(budget) summit meetings that go nowhere,'' Rep. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., said after meeting with other grumbling Democrats on
Wednesday.
   ``They should junk the budget summit,'' added Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ill.
   Non-leadership members of both parties already have begun trying
to come up with their own separate proposals for reducing the
deficit.

<HEAD>Democrat Runs As Tax-Cutter, Turning Issue On GOP Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois is witnessing a political role
reversal this fall in the campaign for governor: a Democrat running
as a tax-cutting, budget-slashing fiscal conservative, and a
Republican under attack as a tax-and-spend liberal.
   Republican Jim Edgar has found himself on the defensive against
Democrat Neil Hartigan's anti-tax rhetoric, and recent polls have
indicated the race is virtually a dead heat.
   ``Edgar has got to find a way to deal with the tax issue,'' says
political scientist Paul Green of Governors State University. ``It
could sink him. It's more than a one-shot issue, it's the dominant
issue.''
   Edgar is a former state lawmaker and aide to four-term Gov.
James R. Thompson. The longest-serving governor in Illinois history
is not seeking re-election.
   The campaign's pivotal tax issue is whether to extend a
two-year, 20 percent income tax increase that provides money to
schools and local governments and is set to expire next July.
   Both candidates supported the tax increase last year, and soon
after its passage Edgar said it should be made permanent. But
Hartigan now wants to scrap the portion earmarked for local
government, hedges on continuing the education levy and is
hammering Edgar as a free spender quick to resort to higher taxes.
   The 52-year-old Hartigan was launched into statewide politics in
the early 1970s by the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, hardly
a boat-rocker. But Hartigan's campaign for governor has taken a
classic outsider-against-the-establishment tack, railing against
bureaucratic bloat and favoritism toward political insiders under
Thompson.
   ``It's time for a change after 14 years of Jim Thompson and Jim
Edgar,'' Hartigan's current television commercial declares. Edgar
spent a decade as Illinois secretary of state.
   Edgar, 44, entered the race as the better-known candidate, both
for a high-profile campaign against drunken driving and because his
signature appears on every driver's license and vehicle
registration in the state.
   But his stance on the temporary tax and his pro-choice position
on abortion rankled conservatives and spurred a challenge in the
GOP primary. Though Edgar won, the contest tapped his resources and
began an anti-tax drumbeat that Hartigan has continued.
   Edgar's response has been a campaign stressing character and
candor, the latter a less-than-veiled effort to disavow the
Thompson record of seeking tax increases after election campaigns
in which he downplayed any need for higher taxes.
   ``By being straight with you before the election,'' Edgar said
in a recent television ad, ``there'll be no surprises after the
election.''
   Political observers say Edgar's cause was hurt when the state
Supreme Court struck from the ballot a proposed state
constitutional amendment designed to make it more difficult for the
General Assembly to increase taxes. Republicans had counted on the
measure to boost turnout, particularly in Chicago's suburbs.
   ``Our people were waiting in the wings, couldn't wait to get to
the ballot box in November,'' said GOP state Sen. Judy Baar
Topinka, whose district in Chicago's western suburbs has been a
hotbed of anti-tax sentiment.
   Hartigan's vulnerability could lie in Chicago's black community.
Black candidates have been rebuffed repeatedly since the death of
the late Mayor Harold Washington, whose 1987 re-election bid
Hartigan opposed. Edgar has gained a few endorsements from black
leaders, and a third-party slate running for local office under
Washington's name poses the threat of a split in a key Democratic
voting bloc.
   Looming over the race is next year's legislative and
congressional reapportionment. Republicans have all but conceded
that Democrats this fall will retain control of the state House and
Senate, which will draft the reapportionment map, and a Hartigan
victory would cement Democrats' control of the process.
   Edgar says he would veto a map skewed in favor of Democrats, an
action that would throw the issue to a bipartisan commission. His
potentially pivotal role in reapportionment has helped solidify
support among GOP politicians who disagree with him on taxes.
   ``We need a governor who will get in there and do the right
thing and veto the ... map,'' said state Senate Republican Leader
James ``Pate'' Philip, who opposed the temporary tax.

   Thousands of Army National Guard and Army
Reserve members from 27 states and the District of Columbia are
being called to active duty today to support Operation Desert
Shield, the military buildup in the Persian Gulf area.
   The Navy activated three reserve units Wednesday.
   The Pentagon had some good news for the more than 150,000 U.S.
soldiers, sailors and airmen already in and around Saudi Arabia.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Wednesday approved ``imminent
danger pay'' of $110 a month for them, retroactive to Sept. 1.
   ``In recognition of the sacrifices our military men and women
are making, I have directed the payment of this supplemental
benefit to the troops on the front lines,'' Cheney said. ``This is
an appropriate step given the risks they face and the harsh
conditions in which they serve.''
   Cheney had been pressed by many members of Congress to improve
benefits for the troops, noting complaints from soldiers in Saudi
Arabia that they lost their subsistence pay of about $150 a month
when they were shipped out of their home bases.
   Cheney's announcement made no mention of restoring the
subsistence pay.
   Maj. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman, said there was no
immediately available estimate of the number of reserve soldiers
affected by Wednesday's Army call-up. It appeared, however, that at
least several thousand soldiers were getting the call.
   The services did not say how many of the activated reserves
would be sent to the gulf area.
   The Navy said the three units it was activating included 166
reservists, but it said not all members of each unit would
necessarily be called up. The units are in California, Colorado and
the District of Columbia.
   The Army said 28 Army National Guard units and 34 Army Reserve
units were being activated today. Most of the units provide
transportation support, while others include specialists in law
enforcement, medical evacuation, water supply and chemical defense.
   They are from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado,
the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   As of Tuesday, 14,323 reserves from the Army, Air Force, Navy
and Coast Guard had been called to active duty. President Bush on
Aug. 22 authorized Cheney to activate the reserves, the first such
call-up for a military crisis since 1968.
   Cheney told Congress on Wednesday that he expects that about
50,000 reservists from all services will be activated by the end of
the month.
   In addition to announcing the call-up of 62 additional reserve
units, the Army said it had alerted 24 other reserve units in 13
states and Puerto Rico that they may be activated.
   ``The Army National Guard and Army Reserve units may be called
to active duty as they are needed during the operation in response
to the crisis our nation faces,'' an Army announcement said.
   Citing ``operational security reasons,'' the Army said it would
not disclose when the units will be activated.
   The units alerted are from Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>FAA Ready to Cut Commercial Air Traffic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is ready
to cut commercial air traffic at 41 airports by thousands of
flights a day if mandatory budget cutbacks take effect Oct. 1.
   Air security and aircraft maintenance inspections also would be
trimmed, the agency said.
   Under the terms of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act, the
budget cuts will occur automatically unless White House and
congressional negotiators reach a compromise agreement before Oct.
1, the start of the 1991 fiscal year.
   A spokesman for the airline industry said the reductions would
prove ``terribly disruptive.''
   The aim of an emergency contingency plan issued Wednesday is to
keep the number of daily flights at a level that the FAA's reduced
force of air traffic controllers could safely handle.
   The FAA said the 40,000 flights that are normally handled by the
41 airports on an average day would be cut by 6,000. It said
cancellations and delays could rise dramatically during bad
weather.
   Smaller airports also are likely to be affected when flights to
and from the larger airports are canceled, the FAA said.
   ``The Gramm-Rudman reductions would cut deeply into the muscle
of the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as other government
agencies,'' said FAA administrator James B. Busey.
   Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
which represents the nation's major air carriers, said the plan
will force ``drastic cuts.''
   ``The proposed reduction will be terribly disruptive to the
nation's air transport system, its passengers and shippers,''
Aaronson said, contending the situation illustrates that FAA's air
control functions cannot be operated efficiently ``as long as the
agency is the captive of the federal civil service and budget
systems.''
   But he said the possibility that cutbacks will take effect is
real and that airlines have already begun planning to deal with it.
   The FAA said that if the budget cuts take hold it would have to
furlough each of its 17,200 controllers for two days every two
weeks, an overall manpower reduction of 25 percent on any given
day.
   The FAA calculated the maximum amount of traffic the reduced
force of air controllers could handle safely at each of the 41
airports.
   For example, Busey said that while 98 landings are scheduled
during the busiest hour at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
the maximum number that could be handled safely with a reduced
force of air controllers is 70. Twenty eight landings would have to
be canceled, a reduction of 29 percent.
   Ninety takeoffs are scheduled at O'Hare during its busiest hour
but the most air controllers could handle is 60. Thirty would be
canceled, a 33 percent reduction.
   The maximum number of landings that would be permitted during
the busiest hour at Los Angeles International Airport is 47, a
reduction from 82. Thirty-five flights would have to be canceled, a
33 percent reduction.
   The same figures apply to takeoffs at Los Angeles during the
busiest hour.
   The 39 other airports where reductions in air service may be
made after Oct. 1 are: Albuquerque, Atlanta, Boston,
Bradley-Hartford, Charlotte, Chicago Midway, Cincinnati,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Dallas Love, Dayton, Denver, Detroit, Fort
Lauderdale, Houston Hobby, Houston Intercontinental, Indianapolis,
Memphis, Miami.
   Also, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York Kennedy, New York
LaGuardia, Newark, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh,
Portland International, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, San Diego,
San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Ana, Seattle, St. Louis, Washington
Dulles, Washington National and West Palm Beach.

<HEAD>Oil Supply Fears Fuel New Attack on Gas Guzzlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the Mideast crisis dramatizing the
country's heavy reliance on foreign oil, America's love for gas
guzzling cars is again coming under attack - and Detroit is
scrambling to control the damage.
   The Senate is scheduled to take up legislation Monday on whether
to require automakers to boost average fuel economy to 40 miles per
gallon, a 40 percent increase.
   In the House, sponsors of a similar bill are threatening to make
an end run around the Energy and Commerce Committee - whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., strongly opposes tougher car
mileage requirements - and push the bill directly on the House
floor.
   The fuel economy measure once was given only scant chance, but
industry lobbyists and members of the Bush administration now say
they're concerned the measure may sneak through as Congress
searches for ways to reduce oil consumption.
   The nation's transportation system - and to a great extent the
automobile - accounts for 60 percent of America's energy needs,
said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., sponsor of the Senate bill. He
said that if a 40-miles-per-gallon car were in common use, it would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day.
   The rumblings on Capitol Hill over auto fuel economy have caught
the automakers at a particularly bad time. With gasoline relatively
inexpensive before the latest Persian Gulf crisis, the
manufacturers have been pushing performance over fuel economy when
planning future product lines.
   These plans would have to change dramatically under Bryan's
bill.
   The measure would cause ``economic disaster'' to the industry
and force automakers to retool production lines to meet the new
fuel efficiency requirements, said Thomas Hanna, president of the
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which is leading the fight
against the Senate bill.
   As the bill's prospects have risen, so have the voices on both
sides of the issue.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,''
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told a news conference in
denouncing the legislation. If passed, he said, the measure would
lead to smaller cars and more traffic deaths.
   Skinner said he would recommend that President Bush veto the
bill. He said he is concerned the ``near hysteria'' over the
Mideast situation may propel the legislation through Congress even
though, he insisted, the mileage goals are ``unrealistic,
irresponsible and, more important, unattainable.''
   But environmentalists say Skinner is being taken in by the
automakers, who contend they lack the technology to improve fuel
efficiency dramatically after years of making cars lighter, smaller
and more efficient.
   Since 1975, the average fuel economy of cars sold in the United
States has doubled, from about 14 mpg to 28 mpg. A third of all
models now get more than 30 mpg.
   Further improvements in automakers' fleet-wide average, the
manufacturers say, would mean restricting buyers to compacts.
   ``We're at a different plateau now than we were in 1975,'' said
Albert Slechter, government affairs director for Chrysler Corp.
Fifteen years ago, he acknowledged, cars were too heavy and were
not designed to save gas.
   Such technologies as improved aerodynamic design, front-wheel
drive, improved transmissions, fuel injection and smaller, more
efficient engines are already being used in many cars without
approaching the 40 mpg level of performance, the automakers argue.
   ``There is no secret or magic technology on the shelf to
drastically increase fuel economy,'' said Hanna of the industry
trade association.
   Not true, argued Bryan. He has accumulated his own folder of
studies that he said prove that cars can meet his bill's
requirements, if automakers are ordered to. He scoffed at
suggestions that cars would have to become much smaller.
   The studies cited by Bryan contend there are changes in
transmissions, tires, engine designs and fuel injection systems -
as well as improved aerodynamics - that could significantly improve
fuel economy and maintain a selection of car sizes.
   Deborah Lynn Bleviss, executive director of the International
Institute for Energy Conservation, said manufacturers have
developed a half-dozen prototypes that average 60 to 75 mpg.
   Environmentalists accuse the automakers of pushing
high-performance, ``muscle'' cars over fuel efficiency. Detroit's
1991 model line includes a number of heavy, high-performance models
such as General Motors' revival of the Buick Roadmaster. Its V-8
engine gets 16 mpg in city driving.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that any patriotic American would
buy a Roadmaster with American boys sitting in the desert,'' Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., a sponsor of the House bill, said
Wednesday at a hearing on the bill.
   But Dingell took issue with the link between fuel economy and
the Mideast crisis. He noted that it could take until at least 2005
for the bill to achieve major oil savings.
   ``Do we have reason to assume that the Persian Gulf crisis is
going to wait until 2005?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Wary of FCC's Promise of Lower Phone Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission says
it's giving long-distance telephone users a nice surprise: lower
phone bills.
   But consumer and business groups are suspicious.
   The commission said Wednesday it was extending its ``price cap''
regulatory regime to the interstate long-distance earnings of the
eight largest local phone companies.
   The FCC said the new regulations on local companies could save
customers billions over the next four years. Last year, the
commission replaced the 20-year-old ``rate of return'' regulation
of the largest long-distance company, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., with price caps.
   Previous commission decisions have largely been responsible for
the 40 percent drop in long-distance prices since 1984.
   But Brian Moir, an attorney representing the 730-member
International Communications Association, said the FCC this time
didn't provide statistics to back up its savings claims as it voted
4-0 to impose price caps.
   ``In the past, the commission was quick to announce what the
benefit would be for ratepayers, although we've found those not to
be correct,'' Moir said. ``They didn't do that today. They did not
say ... that this plan would produce `X' dollars of benefit over
the next four years. ... That's disturbing.''
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation
of America, said the changes were a godsend for local phone
companies.
   ``We're going to see long-distance rates actually rise for the
first time in a long time because of the reduced regulation of the
local carriers,'' Kimmelman said. ``We'll probably see their
profits rise as a result.''
   The rules, which go into effect Jan. 1, reduce the rates local
phone companies charge for interstate services, such as levies for
connecting long-distance companies with the local phone network.
   Lower charges to the long-distance companies will mean reduced
charges for long-distance customers, the FCC said.
   ``Adoption of this regulatory reform is expected to reduce
long-distance rates by billions of dollars over the next four
years, yet permit higher profits, provided the (local phone
companies) can become more efficient,'' the FCC said.
   The plan, first proposed in 1987, has gone through several major
modifications after critics complained that phone companies
benefited too much. There has been strong opposition to the plan on
Capitol Hill.
   The commission argues that regulating the prices phone companies
charge, rather than their profits, will give the companies an
incentive to lower their own costs or increase customer demand and
thereby increase their profits beyond what they could earn under
rate of return.
   Complicated formulas that allow the companies to raise prices at
the rate of inflation, minus a ``productivity factor'' offset that
compensates for lower costs of producing phone service, are
designed to assure that there are real price reductions.
   The local companies also will be required to share with
customers profits beyond a specified percentage gain. If the
company gets too profitable, it would have to return all its
profits to customers.
   Commissioner Ervin Duggan concurred in part and dissented in
part, saying he feared prices would go up under the profit-sharing
provision.
   The rules will apply only to the seven regional Bell operating
companies and GTE. The seven Bells are: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and US West.
   The commission said there should be an immediate $317 million
price cut at the eight largest local companies Jan. 1.
   Smaller phone companies will be given the option of adopting
price caps while the FCC further studies whether to make the price
caps mandatory for all companies.
   In the meantime, the interstate revenues of smaller companies
will continue to be regulated under traditional ``rate of return''
regulation, which allows companies to earn a certain percentage
beyond the costs of their investments.
   The FCC voted Wednesday to lower the rate of return from 12
percent to 11.25 percent.
   John Sodolski, president of the United States Telephone
Association, decried the reduction, saying it will discourage
investments to improve the phone network.

<HEAD>Fed's Anti-Inflation Stand Could Deepen Possible Recession</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recession of 1990, if it comes, could be
longer and deeper than expected because of a tough anti-inflation
stance being taken by the Federal Reserve, some economists contend.
   These analysts believe that was the message Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered to Congress on Wednesday when he
talked about ``new and substantial risks'' to the U.S. economy from
the rise in oil prices after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Greenspan gave no indication that the central bank was on the
verge of pushing interest rates lower. He said the economy was
facing threats both from rising inflationary pressures and a
possible recession.
   The comments disappointed the Bush administration and financial
markets, which had been hoping the Fed chief would emphasize
recession risks and signal a willingness to ease credit conditions
to avert or at least lessen the severity of what would be the
country's first economic slump in eight years.
   Many analysts said Greenspan's comments sounded remarkably like
the views being expressed by central bank officials in such
countries as Japan and West Germany. Officials there have said they
viewed the inflationary threats from the oil price shock as the
greater threat.
   ``Central bank officials seem determined not to repeat the same
mistakes they made in the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979,'' said
David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
securities dealer.
   ``In each of those cases, they panicked over the thought of a
recession and eased too soon before they had snuffed out
inflation,'' Jones said.
   Jones said he originally believed the country was headed for a
recession but that it would be a mild one beginning in the fourth
quarter of this year and lasting through the winter.
   But after Greenspan's comments, he said the downturn was likely
to be more severe and last for a full year because he believes the
Fed has decided to postpone any easing moves while it tries to get
inflation down.
   ``If the Fed waits to ease, the recession will be both longer
and deeper,'' Jones said.
   Other economists said they also were looking for a downturn to
begin in the October-December quarter this year, but they were
split on how severe it will be.
   ``We are looking for a mild recession lasting about two quarters
unless the Middle East blows up,'' said David Wyss, senior
financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. ``But that forecast is very
iffy, depending on what happens in the Middle East.''
   During his testimony before the congressional Joint Economic
Committee, Greenspan rejected suggestions that the Fed was, in
effect, being held hostage by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   While he conceded that the Fed's job of promoting
non-inflationary growth had been made more difficult by events in
the Persian Gulf, Greenspan insisted that there still were tools
the central bank could employ to mitigate the fallout.
   But private economists said Greenspan's generally gloomy report
on economic prospects reflected the tough choices facing the Fed.
Normally, rising unemployment and the current widespread economic
weakness would prompt the Fed to lower interest rates to spur
economic activity.
   But the oil price shock means the country is experiencing the
worst bout of inflation in nine years, according to a government
report on consumer prices released Tuesday.
   ``The Fed is in a real bind,'' said Bruce Steinberg, economist
at Merrill Lynch in New York. ``It would like to ease because the
economy is rapidly weakening but at the same time inflation is
rapidly accelerating.''
   Greenspan's comments represented a setback for the Bush
administration. The administration has been lobbying for months for
the Fed to lower interest rates in an effort to avert the first
economic downturn since the 1981-82 recession.
   Greenspan insisted that the economy is still growing, although
at a very slow pace, but he said the risks of a recession had
increased since Aug. 2.
   ``Regrettably, events in the Middle East have introduced new and
substantial risks to the outlook,'' Greenspan said.
   In a report emphasizing the weakness, the Fed on Wednesday
released a review of economic conditions in various parts of the
country. The Fed report said that economic activity in the Fed's 12
regions was either expanding more slowly or actually declining.
   ``Weakness is most apparent in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
districts,'' the report said.

<HEAD>House, Senate Face Vast Differences on Defense Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is on a collision course with the
Senate over the B-2 stealth bomber and other vast differences in
their versions of the fiscal 1991 defense bill.
   ``There's a couple of sticking points. Clearly, the B-2 is a big
one,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said after Wednesday's House action.
   By a party-line vote of 256-155, the House approved a $283
billion defense bill that stops production of the B-2 bomber at the
15 planes in development and slashes $2.4 billion from President
Bush's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known
as Star Wars.
   The Senate, in approving its defense blueprint last month,
adopted a $289 billion bill that makes no change in the
administration's plan for the B-2 and trims about $1 billion from
SDI.
   Negotiators for the House and Senate will meet later this month
in the hope of finding some common ground in their widely divergent
bills and then producing a package acceptable to the president.
   Moments before the final House vote, Rep. Bill Dickinson of
Alabama, ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, said
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney vowed to recommend a veto of the
House measure.
   Dickinson also was sharply critical of the final legislation.
   ``With Democrat defense bills like this, Saddam Hussein should
have waited another couple of years before invading Kuwait. That
way, we wouldn't have had the men or machines to oppose him,'' he
said.
   Aspin and other Democrats shared a different perspective of the
package.
   ``The bill provides for a military still primarily sized and
shaped to meet the Soviet threat. But it takes the first steps
toward buying the right defense for a new era,'' Aspin said.
   First on the agenda for members of the House and Senate Armed
Services committees who will take part in the conference is an
overall spending total for defense.
   That number will be decided by White House and congressional
negotiators hammering out an agreement on how to pare $50 billion
from the federal deficit in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The most contentious issue for defense bargainers will be the
B-2 bomber.
   Bush had sought $4.6 billion for two of the bat-winged planes
and advanced procurement of parts for six more in fiscal 1992. The
Senate concurred with his proposal.
   But the House approved ending production of the aircraft, the
costliest in history at nearly $865 million a plane, after the 15
bombers already under construction are completed.
   Acknowledging the inevitable, proponents of the aircraft debated
the issue but did call for a vote.
   ``We're in an awfully strong position that they didn't even want
to offer an amendment,'' Aspin said, noting that measures are not
offered ``because you think you're going to get killed.''
   The Senate narrowly turned aside attempts to cancel the B-2,
which has the strong upport of Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   House members will likely reject anything other than the action
they took on the bomber.
   On the issue of SDI, the negotiators are expected to split the
difference between the two numbers - $3.7 billion in the Senate and
$2.3 billion in the House.
   But it's unclear whether approximately $3 billion for the
program in fiscal 1991 will be acceptable to the administration.
   Bargainers also must contend with the difficult issues of base
closings, MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and cuts in military
personnel. The House approved a 129,500 reduction in the nation's
2.1 million troops while the Senate agreed to 100,000.
   The administration proposed 38,000 in fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Decision in Bush Case Months Away; Judge Could Urge Stronger
Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil faces a public
hearing next week on the government's conflict-of-interest charges
against him, but a final decision in the case won't be made until
next spring.
   The administrative law judge presiding over the case has several
options, including recommending a stronger charge against Bush than
the one proposed by federal regulators, a government attorney said
Wednesday.
   Bush, 35, was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, a Denver thrift that failed in November 1988 at an
estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. Bush resigned in August
1988, just after his father received the Republican presidential
nomination.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking an order against
Bush that effectively could bar him from working for a bank or a
savings and loan.
   The agency contends Bush failed to adequately disclose to
Silverado his business relationships with developers Kenneth M.
Good and Bill L. Walters, two big borrowers from the institution.
   Bush has denied any wrongdoing.
   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson won't make an
immediate decision on the case after the hearing that begins
Tuesday in Denver, OTS Chief Counsel Harris Weinstein told
reporters at a briefing.
   Davidson is expectedt we have as much at stake
as we did in World War II,'' Kerrey said in a floor speech.
   In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Eagleburger said it is only
reasonable that the United States approach allies who benefit from
the defense of Middle East oil fields and ask them to help shoulder
the cost.
   ``I know it creates some constitutional problems we're going to
have to sort through,'' he told subcommittee chairman Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis. ``But on the other hand, I don't think you would knock
us for going around the world and trying to tell the other
beneficiaries ... that we ought not to have to pay for all of this
ourselves.''
   So far, Eagleburger said, the gulf states have pledged $12
billion, Japan $4 billion, Germany $2 billion and the European
Community $2 billion.
   Obey agreed that allies should share the cost, but attacked
Bush's request to set up a ``National Defense Gift Fund'' as ``one
of the most spectacular end runs on the Constitution ... I have
ever witnessed.''
   In separate votes, the full House and its Appropriations defense
subcommittee moved to require that any money raised from allies be
spent only by Congress.
   The defense subcommittee took its action as it moved ahead with
Bush's request for an additional $1.9 billion to pay for the gulf
military mobilization in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept.
30.
   Eagleburger argued Wednesday that Congress should approve the
cancellation of Egypt's $6.7 billion in military debt, saying
Cairo's already weak economy is suffering a $3.7 billion added
shock from the gulf crisis.
   He said Bush feels strongly that the gesture was important as a
public show of support for Egypt and for President Hosni Mubarak.
   Members of Congress have voiced appreciation for Mubarak's
leadership, but also are wary of the size of the reward at a time
when budget cutters are being forced to hack away at favorite
domestic programs.
   Eagleburger said Israel, whose foreign aid package has
traditionally been linked to the size of Egypt's, also would be
getting more from the United States.

<HEAD>New Poll Shows Durkin and Smith in Dead Heat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Congressman Bob Smith and former
U.S. Sen. John Durkin are in a dead heat in New Hampshire's U.S.
Senate race, according to a poll conducted since last week's
primaries.
   A survey of 633 registered voters found that 39 percent favor
Smith while 35 percent support Democrat Durkin. Because the poll's
margin of error is 4 percent, neither can be said to be ahead.
   The poll found 26 percent are undecided.
   American Research Group of Manchester conducted the telephone
poll last Wednesday and Thursday.
   The same survey found 54 percent support Republican Gov. Judd
Gregg to 21 percent for Democratic nominee and former party
chairman Joe Grandmaison.
   Another 25 percent are undecided.

<HEAD>Muenster Says Pressler Commercial Misleading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Larry Pressler is misleading voters with
a television commercial that claims he has maintained one of the
Senate's best attendance records, says Democratic challenger Ted
Muenster.
   The South Dakota Republican's attendance record in the past two
years is among the Senate's best. He never missed a roll-call vote
in 1989.
   However, his average voting record since winning his seat in
1978 is one of the Senate's worst, Muenster said.
   Congressional records show that he has made marked improvements
in attendance in years just before facing re-election.
   Pressler has answered 90.6 percent of the Senate's roll-call
votes since 1979, ranking him 49th among the 54 senators who have
been in office since then, according to Muenster's compilation of
attendance records.
   Pressler was criticized during his 1984 re-election campaign for
his poor attendance record during his first years in the Senate,
and he said Wednesday he has kept his promise to improve.
   The commercial was intended to deflect the kinds of attacks he
received six years ago, he said.
   ``My commercial refers to the fact that I've improved my voting
record,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union is endorsing
Republican George Voinovich for governor over Democrat Anthony J.
Celebrezze Jr.
   Backing for the former mayor of Cleveland was contained in a
statement released Wednesday by Ohio DRIVE, the political arm of
the union, which represents 150,000 active and retired members
statewide.
   Both candidates had sought the organization's support during
appearances before its convention this summer.
   Ohio DRIVE said the needs and interests of Teamsters would best
be served by the election of Voinovich.
   ``We ... believe that George Voinovich has the proven leadership
needed to improve Ohio's schools, protect and create jobs, provide
qualified health care, and make state government more efficient and
effective,'' the union statement said. DRIVE stands for Democrat
Republican Independent Voter Education.

<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins has accused the Census
Bureau of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up
to 1 million residents in its preliminary 1990 count of the city's
population.
   Dinkins said Wednesday the city is filing a challenge to the
government's figures. Federal aid and representation in Congress
are determined by the Census count.
   ``The 1990 undercount could cost us up to $1 billion in lost
federal aid, or $150 for each man, woman and child living in our
city,'' he said. Dinkins also said the count could cost the city at
least one seat in Congress.
   The mayor said the Census Bureau failed to count 254,534 housing
units, undercounting the city's population by 800,000 to 1 million.
   The Bureau counted 7.033 million people in the city. The
Department of City Planning estimates 8 million people live in the
city.
   ``It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for
the Census Bureau to claim that a city whose resident birth rate
has risen by at least 23 percent and which has welcomed more than
800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has
actually lost population,'' the mayor said.
   The city was given 15 business days to review the Bureau's 1990
preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, Con
Edison and the New York Telephone Co., as well as consulting
surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.
   In his letter to Sheila Grimm, regional director of the Census
Bureau, Dinkins asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city
blocks - approximately 43 percent of the city's more than 28,000
residential blocks.
   The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's
challenge.
   In a three-block area in one section of Queens, the city counted
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one-and
two-family homes; the Census Bureau counted zero units.
   Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to
be undercounted by the bureau, said Richard Schaffer, director of
the Department of City Planning and chairman of the City Planning
Commission.
   Dinkins said the 1980 undercount, put by the Census Bureau at
450,000, cost New York City some $675 million in federal aid during
the ensuing 10 years.

<HEAD>Kuwaitis: Most Iraqi Soldiers Seem Poor, Disoriented</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of Iraqi forces in Kuwait
appear to be poor, confused teen-agers, but crack Republican Guards
are tightening their control over the city, Kuwaitis fleeing their
country say.
   Refugees interviewed over the past few days at this border
crossing said Iraqi troops were becoming increasingly violent in
their campaign to force Kuwaitis to accept Iraqi occupation.
   Checkpoints every 900 feet are now controlled by at least one
Republican Guard, who makes sure that searches are thorough.
   Neighborhood searches have also become more intense, with whole
areas completely cut off with six or eight roadblocks as up to 20
soldiers comb each house, said the refugees, who generally spoke on
condition of anonymity to protect family members left behind from
possible retribution.
   About 500 refugees arrived Wednesday, a sharp drop from the more
than 6,000 who had poured across the border since Saturday, when
Iraq opened it for the first time in more than a month.
   The numbers tumbled Monday when Iraqi troops began grabbing men
under 40 at random from cars trying to cross. Those crossing
Wednesday were old men, women and children.
   Reports of rape, even against Kuwait women, had climbed.
   A flier distributed in Kuwait on Sunday warned that anyone
shooting a gun would be executed and any house from which a gun is
fired would be torn down, as would neighboring homes.
   The Iraqis are already carrying out the threat, with former army
or police officers and suspected resistance members disappearing
and turning up dead, the refugees said.
   ``They seem to like blood. This is really a bloody regime,''
said Faisal, a 27-year-old computer programmer.
   But each checkpoint seems to be operating under a different set
of rules in terms of the questions Iraqi soldiers ask, said a
Kuwaiti defense department official who visited his country last
week.
   ``They seem to lack stable or strict instructions,'' he said.
   Refugees said the Iraqi troops were constantly conducting
maneuvers.
   Iraq was attempting to engender respect in Kuwait for President
Saddam ussein, who has annexed the oil-rich emirate.
   The seaside corniche was hung every few yards with his portrait
and Friday prayer leaders were told to put in a good word about him
in their sermons.
   When they refused and concentrated on prayers for salvation,
prayer sermons were canceled, the refugees said.
   The Iraqi troops are grabbing as many consumer goods as they
can, refugees said, either by outright theft or extortion.
   At a checkpoint, for example, an Iraqi soldier might drop a
bullet into a car's trunk and accuse the driver of being a member
of the resistance. The driver hands over a watch or some cigarettes
and the accusation is dropped.
   ``If your car breaks down or you run out of gas and you have to
leave it, you can forget about the tires and engine,'' said a
22-year-old student.
   ``You feel everybody (among the Iraqi troops) is poor and badly
fed,'' said a prominent economist who fled Monday. ``They beg for
food and water.''
   Iraqi forces have slaughtered most of the horses in Kuwait and
even zoo animals for food, the refugees said. The Iraqi army was
also trying to take control of all private-run supermarkets in
Kuwait.
   The student said the combat-readiness of the Iraqis was
questionable, with many of the teen-age soldiers appearing fearful
of entering neighborhoods where soldiers had been shot at.
   ``It's obvious they are frightened. The Iraqi soldiers are
respected too much in the eyes of the world,'' he said.
   The bulk of Iraqi troops seem to be about 16 years old, poor and
still befuddled about what they are doing in Kuwait, refugees said.
   The adolescent soldiers repeatedly tell Kuwaits that they had
been instructed before the Aug. 2 invasion that they were moving
into Kuwait for maneuvers with other Arab armies to prepare for an
attack on Israel.
   Not all Iraqi troops are not hostile, the Kuwaitis said.
   ``Sometimes if I am nice with them, they are nice with me,''
said the economist. ``They say, `I am Arab, Islamic, like you.''

<HEAD>Computer `Hiccups,' But Magellan Keeps on Mapping Venus</HEAD>

   ``Hiccups'' keep plaguing a computer
aboard the Magellan spacecraft, which nevertheless has completed
more than 30 consecutive orbits making radar pictures of
cloud-covered Venus, NASA says.
   The pesky malfunctions are in the backup computer that helps
point the orbiter.
   The same computer - one of four aboard Magellan - played a major
role when engineers lost contact with the spacecraft Aug. 16 and
again on Aug. 21, although the precise cause of those incidents
remains unknown.
   Despite the glitches, the spacecraft on Wednesday morning
completed its 30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked, volcanic
landscape of Venus. Magellan, which arrived at Venus on Aug. 10, is
making almost eight orbits daily. It began its mapping mission on
Saturday.
   ``Since Venus is almost the same size as Earth, the 30-orbit
image patch ... would drape an area on Earth extending from Los
Angeles to Albuquerque and from the North Pole to nearly the South
Pole,'' NASA said in a statement.
   Pictures released in past weeks have shown long ridges and
valleys, networks of faults, large flows of solidified lava and
volcanic craters.
   The most recent glitch happened Monday, when the backup to
Magellan's main computer got a set of false alerts from the backup
pointing computer. The spacecraft wasn't operating on either backup
computer, so mapping continued.
   Other glitches happened just after Magellan reached Venus, then
again on Sept. 4.
   Engineers nicknamed the malfunctions ``hiccups,'' said Steve
Wall, Magellan experiment representative at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan traveled a looping, 948-million-mile path to Venus
after being launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989.
Magellan and Venus are now almost 156 million miles from Earth.

<HEAD>Bush's `Line in the Sand' Is Drawn In Saudi Desert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's promised ``line in
the sand'' defense of Saudi Arabia is anything but linear. Troops
are scattered in clumps near highways, potential desert tank routes
and the kingdom's oil fields.
   From these carefully chosen locations, the U.S. military
commander believes he could fight a mobile desert war.
   But there is also concern about sustaining troops and equipment
in such configurations given the region's harsh conditions.
   The United States has exercised troops in the Middle East but
never fought a war in the region. History is its guide.
   ``Look at Rommel, look at North Africa, the Arab-Israeli wars
and all the rest of them,'' Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the
commander of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, said in an interview last
week.
   ``A war in the desert is a war of mobility and lethality,''
Schwarzkopf said. ``It's not a war of straight lines drawn in the
sand, where you dig in and say, `I will defend here or die.' Most
people who do that die.''
   The Marines and the Army are splitting the burden of forming the
defensive clusters.
   Marines are guarding the north-south coastal highway into Saudi
Arabia from Kuwait and also the kingdom's oil fields and support
facilities not far from the coast.
   Those would be the major prize if Iraq were to invade, but the
United States has positioned a sizebable ground force and arranged
for air-to-ground support. That would make if difficult for Iraq to
move down the coastal roads.
   ``Saddam Hussein's just got to look around and say to himself,
`I'm over my head,''' Marine Maj. Gen. Royal N. Moore Jr. said
recently when asked about the size of the deployment.
   Saddam's other option for a ground invasion would be inland over
the desert, where Arab forces form the front lines and heavy
American ground forces are beginning o fan out behind them in
defensive formations.
   The M-1 tanks and heavy artillery of the 24th and 197th
mechanized infantries are the backbone of these forces, and several
more heavy units are en route.
   Smaller, more mobile vehicles carrying Tow anti-tank missiles
and other weapons also are becoming a more common sight across
certain areas of the desert. These units are drilled in speeding
toward oncoming tanks, firing at them and rushing back to base
camps to rearm for more combat. Attack helicopters with anti-tank
systems would be deployed to do much of the same from the air.
   There are vast stretches between some of the American camps. But
U.S. planners say the more mobile of the ground forces would have
time to reach these areas if Saddam chose them for a route of
attack.
   They consider such a decision unlikely because these open areas
generally are locations U.S. commanders believe Iraq would have
difficulty supplying with fuel and ammunition.
   Sustainability also is a question high in the minds of the
American commanders. Some spare parts, fuel trucks and other
supplies are still hard to come by.
   The M-1s and other equipment are being used as little as
possible because of the shortages.
   ``We're being very careful what we do with the equipment,'' said
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, commander ofthe 24th Infantry. ``It will be a
tremendous challenge to build the logistics system needed for
maintenance, management and parts distribution 7,000 miles from
home.''
   To help sustain the force, National Guard and Reserve units are
being brought in to convert salt water to drinking water and
provide transportation and other support services that would be
crucial if fighting breaks out.

<HEAD>Thatcher's Travel East: A Family Reunion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In many ways British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's first visit this week to two new East European
democracies, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, was like a family reunion.
   She hailed both for their bloodless revolutions, which ended
decades of Communist rule and led to elections this year that
installed the countries' first democratic governments in more than
40 years.
   They had, she declared, returned ``once more to their rightful
place in Europe.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher, who traveling to Switzerland today on the
last leg of a six-day trip, singled out for special attention
Hungary's Prime Minister Joszef Antall. He is the only true
political soulmate the upheaval in Eastern Europe has produced for
the British Conservative Party leader.
   ``We believe in the same things and act on our beliefs,'' she
told Antall, who has seen inflation hit 25 percent to 30 percent
and unemployment rise under his center-right government, headed by
his Democratic Forum party.
   ``The fact that you are the only conservative government in
Eastern Europe merits topmost consideration,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher seemed less at ease perched on a stool in a Prague
coffee bar at 10 o'clock in the morning with Czechoslovakia's
Vaclav Havel.
   The playwright turned president joked and laughed, and had a
beer. Mrs. Thatcher smiled politely and had a coffee.
   In Hungary, during a 1984 trip under communist rule, she'd been
through the usual stuff of official visits - rounds of
wreath-laying, handshaking, banquets, walkabouts, political talks
and news conferences.
   This time everything was different.
   If the Hungarian guards of honor looked a shade drab in green
fatigues it was because they have abandoned their Soviet-style
uniforms and red stars, and the new uniforms are still being
designed.
   In Prague, a square she named after Winston Churchill at a small
ceremony formerly bore the name of a Communist Party general
secretary, Antonin Zapotocky.
   In 1984, the nearest she got to a whiff of private enterprise
was a Budapest street market.
   This time she toured Budapest's fledgling stock exchange. The
first in the East bloc in more than four decades, it trades just
one hour a day, has fewer than 50 members and is having a tough
time getting Hungarians to buy shares.
   ``Small is beautiful,'' commented a Hungarian official showing
her around.
   ``Well, it's start,'' replied Mrs. Thatcher. ``It's really
wonderful to see it done this way. ... You are ahead of Moscow.''
   In a similar vein, she interrupted her husband, Denis, when he
sought production figures from one of Hungary's new entrepreneurs,
a former Olympic gold javelin gold medallist, Miklos Nemeth.
   Nemeth has set up a javelin-manufacturing company.
   ``You musn't ask question like that, he's only just started,''
she interjected. ``Come back in three or four years' time and he'll
tell you.''

   A 2-year-old boy mauled by six Rottweiler dogs
at his grandmother's house was in critical condition Wednesday,
authorities said.
   The Tuesday night attack left Steven Selfridge of Saxonburg with
puncture wounds and damage to his windpipe and one lung, according
to Dr. Max Ramenofsky of Allegheny General Hospital.
   The child also lost a lot of blood, Ramenofsky said.
   Butler Township police said Steven and his 11-year-old cousin
were playing at the home when one of the Rottweilers, a breed known
for strong neck and jaw muscles, came onto the porch and dragged
him into a fenced-in yard.
   A half-dozen dogs then mauled the boy until he was unconscious,
police said.
   The boy's grandmother, Alma Evanick, had been in the coronary
care unit of Butler Memorial Hospial, said Butler Township Police
Chief Gary Garman. One dog lived at the house and the five others
were brought by the visiting 11-year-old, authorities said.
   The cousin, Jamie Ross, tried to stop the attack by shielding
him with her body, rescuers said.
   ``She's the real hero here,'' said Chris Jones, a paramedic with
Butler Ambulance Service who was the first to arrive at the scene.
``At one point she tried to cover the little boy with her body.
   ``When she saw it wasn't going go work, she ran into the house
and called 911.''
   Jamie, who was bitten, was treated at Butler County Memorial
Hospital and released.
   Jones rescued the boy by putting on protective firefighter's
gear and chasing away the dogs with blasts from a fire
extinguisher.
   The dogs were being held in quarantine at the home, police said.

<HEAD>Leading Journalist, Ambassador's Daughter, Kidnapped in Bogota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after the daughter of Colombia's
ambassador to Canada was abducted, armed men kidnapped a journalist
whose family owns the country's leading newspaper and shot his
chauffeur to death, police said.
   It was not immediately known if drug traffickers, who are at war
with the government, were responsible for Wednesday's abductions.
   The newspaper La Prensa reported Wednesday that the Medellin
cocaine cartel had abducted the six journalists missing since Aug.
30.
   It said the six were taken in a bid to pressure the government
into negotiating the terms under which drug traffickers could be
tried in Colombia.
   La Prensa said it received the information from a cartel
spokesman.
   The journalists, including Diana Turbay, daughter of former
President Julio Cesar Turbay, disappeared on their way to interview
a guerrilla leader in the countryside.
   The ambassador's daughter, Marina Montoya de Perez, was abducted
in Bogota several hours before the nighttime kidnapping in the
capital of Francisco Santos. His family owns El Tiempo, Colombia's
largest newspaper.
   Santos was taken by a group of heavily armed men traveling in
two jeeps who shot his driver to death before forcing him into one
of the jeeps, the police said in a report.
   Also Wednesday, the newspaper El Espectador, citing official
sources, reported that drug traffickers had offered $280,000 to
those who helped a man accused of killing a presidential candidate
escape from prison.
   Jaime Rueda Rocha fled Bogota's La Picota penitentiary wearing a
disguise and apparantly aided by a man posingas his lawyer, a
police report said.
   Rueda was one of three suspects being held for the murder of
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the popular presidential candidate shot ato
death on Aug. 18, 1989. His death set off the government's war with
Medellin cartel leaders, who authorities say masterminded Galan's
killing.
   Officials say Rueda helped coordinate the cartel's bombing
campaigns during the past year and is one of the country's most
dangerous terrorists.
   Earlier this month, President Cesar Gaviria decreed that drug
traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes can be
tried in Colombia, and not be extradited to the United States - the
fate they fear most.
   There has been no official response from the cartel to Gaviria's
offer, which provides reduced sentences of up to 50 percent to
surrendering drug traffickers.
   Drug traffickers issued a communique on Tuesday saying they will
maintain the cease-fire in their attacks against the goverment,
which have claimed the lives of about 550 people this year.
   They declared the unilateral cease-fire on July 27.
   ``For the moment, it is not in our interest to reactivate the
bomb attacks in any area of the country,'' said a statement bearing
the letterhead ``The Extraditables,'' as the Medellin cartel calls
itself.

   The liveliest Middle East battlefield is the
op-ed page, where Abe accuses Pat of anti-Semitism, Pat says Abe
executed ``a contract hit'' on him for the Israel lobby, and the
normally combative Bill tries to mediate.
   The stateside war of the columnists involves A.M. Rosenthal,
Patrick Buchanan and William F. Buckley Jr. in a debate over U.S.
Middle East policy that seems to have almost forgotten about Iraq.
   Fighting began in the last week of August on ``The McLaughlin
Group,'' the television talk show on which Buchanan is a regular.
   Asked if he thought war with Iraq was inevitable, Buchanan said
no, and added: ``There are only two groups that are beating the
drums right now for war in the Middle East, and that is the Israeli
Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.''
   ``Those are fighting words,'' host John McLaughlin noted.
   Rosenthal, former executive editor and now columnist for The New
York Times, thought so, too. He wrote in Friday's column:
   ``We are not dealing here with country-club anti-Semitism but
with the blood libel that often grows out of it: Jews are not like
us but are others, with alien loyalties for which they will
sacrifice the lives of Americans.''
   Rosenthal denounced Buchanan's ``venom about Jews. In one
column, he denounced five people for supporting military action
against Iraq - all Jews, including me.''
   The Buchanan-Rosenthal feud is part of a broader rift among
conservative columnists over whether the U.S. is overextending
itself militarily in the post-Cold War world, particularly in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``It's been a long time since columnists have mattered so
much,'' Peggy Noonan, a former speech writer for Ronald Reagan and
George Bush, said last week. ``It's exciting.''
   In a column published Wednesday in the New York Post and
elsewhere, Buchanan denied Rosenthal's charge.
   ``What we have here, friends, is a contract hit, done, my guess,
in collusion with the same folks who used to feed me all that good
stuff on Jesse Jackson when I was considered more reliable. For the
one character who has been howling about the `amen corner' (remark)
is Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League.''
   Why else, argued the former aide to presidents Nixon and Reagan,
would Rosenthal have waited three weeks to write about a remark he
found so upsetting?
   Once, Buchanan wrote, ``I was an uncritical apologist for
Israel,'' but became disillusioned for a variety of reasons,
including Israel's treatment of Palestinians, its attempts to spy
on the United States and ``the caustic, cutting cracks about my
(Roman Catholic) church and popes from both Israel and its amen
corner in the United States.''
   On Wednesday's editorial page, the Post sided with Rosenthal.
Besides the column in which Buchanan listed Americans with Jewish
names who favored an attack on Iraq, there was one in which he
wrote that in case of war Americans would march ``up that bloody
road to Baghdad ... kids with names like McAllister, Murphy,
Gonzales, and Leroy Brown.''
   ``The names in this list are chosen just as carefully, we
believe, as the names on his list of alleged warmongers: the
Rosenthals and the Krauthammers and so forth,'' the Post
editorialized.
   Meanwhile, in Wednesday's Daily News, Buckley tried to bring
some perspective to the fight, which he called ``the hot talk among
journalists and politics-minded intellectuals.''
   Peacemaker was an unlikely role for a man who has long baited
guests on his aptly-named television program, ``Firing Line,'' and
who once came close to slugging Gore Vidal on live national
television after Vidal called him a ``crypto Nazi.''
   Buckley described both columnists as his friends. The
occasionally volatile Rosenthal had ``gone ballistic,'' he said,
and Buchanan had been ``insensitive to those fine lines that tend
publicly to define racially or ethnically offensive analysis or
rhetoric.''
   ``The Buchanans need to understand the nature of sensibilities
in an age that coexisted with Auschwitz,'' he wrote. ``And the
Rosenthals need to understand that clumsy forensic manners are less
than a genocidal offense...''
   Rosenthal returned a telephone call Wednesday, thus getting the
last word - or at least the latest one. Buchanan did not call after
a message was left for him.
   Rosenthal said he had not written earlier about the ``amen
corner'' remark because he had been away at a conference in Norway
- ``on hatred, appropriately enough'' - and on vacation.
   ``Pat Buchanan is no longer my problem,'' he said. ``He is now
the problem of people who print him and put him on the air. Most of
all, he's Pat Buchanan's problem.''

   Sickness, starvation and the
possibility of further fighting are on the rise in Liberia, but
rival guerrilla chiefs are willing to talk peace, a senior U.S.
diplomat said after meeting the leaders.
   Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, had put himself at considerable personal risk in traveling
to the civil war-ravaged land, where sporadic fighting continues.
   ``The prospects for increased warfare are growing,'' Cohen told
a news conference Wednesday in Abidjan after returning from the
visit.
   ``I feel the situation in Liberia is deteriorating. More and
more people are in danger of starvation and death from diseases,
especially a growing cholera threat,'' Cohen said.
   He said conditions worsened after President Samuel Doe, accused
by the rebels of corruption and human rights abuses, was captured
and killed last week by the rebel forces of Prince Johnson.
   Reprisals against Doe supporters have been reported and many Doe
loyalists are still refusing to surrender to rebels for fear of
being killed. Rival rebel forces have also clashed.
   Cohen spoke hours after the commander of a West African
multinational army sent to end the fighting in Liberia announced
his 3,000 troops have a new mandate to launch ``a total offensive''
to end the 9-month-old war.
   Nigeria and Ghana on Wednesday were preparing to send another
1,000 soldiers to Monrovia. They were waiting in Freetown to board
ships for the besieged capital.
   More than 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
conflict. They were killed mainly because of their tribal
affiliation.
   Earlier Wednesday, Cohen crossed the border from Ivory Coast to
go behind the lines of rebel leader Charles Taylor, who controls
most of Liberia.
   The U.S. envoy said he found the man many accuse of prolonging
the war ``in a negotiating mood.''
   On Tuesday, he flew to Monrovia aboard a U.S. Marine helicopter
and met with rival rebel chief Johnson, whose forces control
Liberia's capital. ``He was helpful and pro-democratic,'' Cohen
said.
   Johnson, a former Taylor lieutenant, has embraced West African
Economic Community plans to use their task force to force a
cease-fire and install an interim government to organize fair
elections.
   He has said he wants to return to the barracks where he started
off as an officer of Doe.
   Taylor says his men will fight until the West Africans withdraw.
He has said he wants democracy but that he also would be unhappy to
see anyone but himself lead Liberia for up to five years after the
conflict ends.
   Cohen said both rebel leaders ``said they would like to see
Liberia with a truly democratic system and would cooperate in
organizing that.
   ``I have the feeling that Charles Taylor is prepared to
negotiate everything. I think he feels that peace is more important
than war,'' Cohen said.
   In response to questions, he did not rule out aid for the West
African army from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia.
   ``Everything is going to be reviewed,'' he said, having reported
back to President Bush.
   The United States has been under considerable pressure to send
troops to stop the bloodshed, which began when Taylor's fighters
invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to topple Doe.
   Before cutting aid in 1985, the United States gave Doe's
administration half a billion dollar in aid despite repeated
charges of human rights violations. Doe took power in a bloody 1980
coup.

<TEXT>
   Pierre Rinfret, the Republicans'
last-minute, bottom-of-the-barrel choice to run against Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo, is out of money, out a campaign manager and
practically out of the race.
   John Denny, Rinfret's deputy campaign manager, said Wednesday
there was ``a strong possibility'' Rinfret will stop actively
campaigning because of money woes.
   The millionaire economist, who in recent months had been derided
by prominent members of his own party as a ``buffoon'' and
``brainless wonder,'' accused state GOP leaders of failing to back
him financially.
   ``Our financial situation is so desperate that I'm probably
going to have to shut down our entire operation this Friday,''
Rinfret wrote to GOP leaders Tuesday. ``I thought you should know
that all of our money is gone.''
   The 66-year-old candidate would not elaborate on the statement.
   Also on Wednesday, State Assemblyman John Faso, Rinfret's
campaign manager, said in a statement he was ``no longer part of
the campaign.''``It has been mutually decided that the campaign
would take a different direction,'' he said.
   William Simon, Rinfret's campaign finance chairman, also
defected. ``I told him I'm not a fund-raiser, that's it,'' Simon
said. ``I wish him well.''
   Rinfret's dark-horse challenge to Cuomo's bid for a third,
four-year term marks the first run for public office for the former
unpaid adviser to President Nixon.
   Desperate GOP officials recruited Rinfret in May after a host of
prominent Republicans refused to take on Cuomo, including Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
D'Amato at one point called a race against Cuomo a ``kamikaze
mission.''
   A statewide poll released this week had Cuomo as the choice of
60 percent of 821 voters surveyed. Rinfret had less than 15
percent. The survey by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion has a margin of error of four points.
   During the campaign, Rinfret has called for the possible sale of
the New York City subway system and invited a TV reporter to his
inauguration - with the suggestion she leave her husband at home.
His academic credentials were questioned after he distributed a
biography that gave him the title ``Dr.,'' which he claimed to be
entitled to because of a diploma from a French university.
   Cuomo has reported having about $8 million in his campaign fund.
Rinfret has reported raising about $900,000, including a $500,000
loan from himself.
   Denny refused to say how much was left in the Rinfret campaign
kitty except that it was ``not much.''
   John McArdle, a spokesman for state Senate Majority Leader Ralph
Marino, would not say how much, if any, money Rinfret would be
given by Republican leaders, but he added: ``We can't let him fold
up shop.''
   ``It's in all of our interests ... to help our gubernatorial
candidate and we intend to help him to the extent we can,'' McArdle
said.
   This close to the Nov. 6 election, Rinfret's name can be removed
from the ballot only if he dies or moves out of state.
   Some GOP leaders said Rinfret should have kept quiet for the
sake of the party.
   ``It certainly puts his campaign in reverse gear,'' said John
Cochrane, a state assemblyman and Suffolk County GOP chairman. ``It
makes all our campaigns more difficult when the standardbearer is
obviously going through a difficult time and goes public with it.''

<HEAD>Appeals Judge in North Case Assigned to Poindexter Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two judges who voted to set aside the
Iran-Contra convictions of Oliver L. North has been assigned to the
panel that will hear John M. Poindexter's appeal.
   Circuit Judge David Sentelle will sit on the panel reviewing
Poindexter's convictions along with judges Abner Mikva and Douglas
H. Ginsburg, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said in an
order made public Wednesday.
   In July, Sentelle joined Judge Laurence Silberman in setting
aside North's three Iran-Contra convictions.
   The judges ordered a hearing to determine if references to the
testimony that North gave Congress under a grant of limited
immunity from prosecution had unfairly seeped into the former White
House aide's trial.
   Poindexter, national security adviser in the Reagan
administration, was convicted of five counts of lying and
obstructing congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair.
He was given a six-month sentence but is free pending appeal.
   Both Poindexter and North testified before congressional
committees about the Iran-Contra affair under immunity grants that
bar prosecutors from using what they said as evidence against them.
   The appeals court set arguments on the case for Feb. 28.

<HEAD>FCC Gives Chicago License to `More Qualified' Applicant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of WSNS-TV in Chicago lost a
lengthy license renewal battle when the Federal Communications
Commission said a competing applicant was more deserving to run the
station.
   The commission granted Monroe Communications Corp. a license to
build a new TV station using channel 44. It said Monroe was more
qualified than the current licensee, Video 44, which had switched
the station's format to a subscription movie service.
   The FCC rarely denies license renewals and had given Video 44 a
renewal in 1989. But the commission reconsidered the case under
orders from a federal appeals court in Washington.
   Video 44 may appeal the decision to the appeals court. Station
officials did not return a call Wednesday seeking comment.

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Large Increase in Drug Treatment Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public spending on drug abuse treatment should
be increased by more than $2 billion to help more users quit their
drug habits, a panel of experts recommends.
   ``Treatment needs to be recognized as a more important component
of drug policy than it has been in recent years,'' Lawrence S.
Lewin, chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee that studied
the problem, said Wednesday.
   ``It is time we allocated sufficient resources so that everyone
who needs drug treatment will be able to get it,'' he said.
   An estimated 5.5 million people in the United States need
treatment for drug abuse or dependence, according to the panel's
report, which was requested by Congress.
   But in 1987, the latest year for which figures were available,
only about 650,000 received treatment in public programs and
200,000 were treated in private programs, the report said.

<HEAD>Report: Birth Spacing Could Save Millions of Lives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of infant deaths could be prevented
if women in developing nations increased the length of time between
births, an independent agency has reported.
   ``Birth intervals of less than two years are strongly and
consistently associated with higher mortality,'' the Population
Crisis Committee said in a report Wednesday.
   When there is less than two years between births, the risk of
the second child dying in infancy is increased by between 60
percent and 70 percent, the study said. And it doubles the chance
of the earlier child dying by age 5.
   ``Family planning should be the first step toward improving
child survival,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice president of the
committee, which advocates provision of contraceptives and family
planning programs.
   ``Through family planning the cycle of weak mothers giving birth
to weak children can be broken,'' Camp said.
   While admitting that accurate statistics are difficult to
collect in many developing nations, the report estimates that 10
million infants and 4 million children age 1 to 5 die each year.
   About 1.8 million of these deaths could be prevented by
extending the interval between births to two years, the study
estimates.
   The study also said infant and child deaths could be reduced by
as many as 3 million annually through the use of family planning
services to delay first births for young women and to space them
out later.

<HEAD>State Department Warns of Bombing Threat in Manila</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are being warned about ``a possible
imminent terrorist bombing'' in Manila, where talks on the future
of U.S. military bases in the Philippines are underway.
   ``The U.S. government believes this threat to be both specific
and credible,'' the State Department said in a statement late
Wednesday, linking the possible bombing to the communist New
People's Army.
   The department said the danger was ``in the vicinity of Roxas
Boulevard in Manila.''
   Several hotels, the U.S. Embassy and the central bank building
where the base talks are being held lie along the boulevard, which
runs from near the Manila airport to the heart of the city.
   Also on the street is a U.S. government residential and
recreational compound, Seafront, that was the site of a bombing
last year that was blamed on communist rebels. No one was injured.
   The New People's Army has been trying to overthrow the
Philippine government for more than two decades.
   There have been several bombings within the last few weeks, but
the government of President Corazon Aquino has blamed most of them
on right-wing rebel soldiers.
   The base talks, which opened Tuesday, aim to produce a new
agreement for the future of the U.S. military in the Philippines.
   The presence of 40,000 U.S. armed forces personnel and
dependents, most at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, has been
the target of large-scale protests. Richard Armitage, the chief
U.S. negotiator at the talks, said the American presence will be
reduced.
   The State Department has issued several warnings to U.S.
citizens in the past about general threats against Americans in the
Philippines, but the one issued Wednesday night was unusually
specific.

<HEAD>Former GOP Governor Launches Comeback Bid in Alaska</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK BAUMGARTNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Republican Gov. Walter J. Hickel
has jumped into Alaska's gubernatorial race at the last minute as a
third-party candidate.
   The 71-year-old developer launched his surprise comeback bid
Wednesday under the banner of the Alaskan Independence Party, whose
ticket, led by John Lindauer, withdrew to let Hickel in.
   Sen. Jack Coghill, who was the lieutenant governor candidate on
the Republican ticket with nominee Arliss Sturgulewski, switched to
the third-party ticket with Hickel.
   Some politicians said Hickel's entry into the race would work to
the benefit of the Democratic candidate, former Anchorage Mayor
Tony Knowles, by splitting the GOP vote and throwing Sturgulewski's
campaign into disarray.
   Hickel was known as a champion of development while governor
from 1966 to 1969, when he was appointed Interior Secretary by
President Nixon. He was dismissed in 1970 for his inability to get
along with the White House.
   ``The spirit of Alaska has been lost in recent years,'' Hickel
said in announcing his comeback bid.
   Hickel, who wants to build a natural gas pipeline, liquefaction
plant and port to export gas to Asia, said he offers a can-do
attitude many Alaskans had found lacking in the election campaign.
   ``I'm not one to study things to death,'' he said. ``I get
things done.''
   Papers nominating Hickel and Coghill were filed with the state a
half-hour before the 5 p.m. deadline.
   Hickel enters the race six weeks before Election Day without a
campaign headquarters and without having raised any money. But he
said, ``The best campaign office I know is right out there on the
streets and in the villages.''
   Hickel is owner of a company that builds and operates hotels and
shopping centers in Alaska.
   Sturgulewski, forced to scramble to find a new running mate,
chose Anchorage businessman Jim Campbell, who came in a strong
second to her in the Aug. 28 GOP primary.
   ``It's an unfortunate thing for Alaska politics,'' she said of
Coghill's defection. ``I'm fortunate to be a running mate with
someone who doesn't play those kinds of games.''
   Coghill said he made the switch because conservatives were not
being won over by the Sturgulewski campaign.
   Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper, who is not seeking a second term,
said he believes the development will help Knowles. ``Alaska
politics has always been a Wild West show, and it looks like this
is the shootout at the GOP corral,'' he said.
   The Alaskan Independence Party was the vehicle used in previous
gubernatorial campaigns by fringe candidate Joe Vogler, a miner who
argued that Alaska is unfairly and illegally treated as a colony by
the federal government.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Dip</HEAD>

   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen on
Thursday, while share prices edged down.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 123.19 points, or 0.52
percent, ending the day at a year low of 23,602.98. The index lost
158.65 points on Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 137.05 yen, down exactly one yen from
Wednesday's 138.05-yen finish. It opened at 137.20 yen and ranged
between 136.45 yen and 137.40 yen.
   ``The dollar fell as investors bought back the yen against
European currencies as part of their position adjustments,'' said
Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   After decreasing their yen holding positions since Monday,
investors were once again buying the Japanese currency on Thursday,
he said.
   The dollar strengthened earlier this week when investors began
selling the yen they had overbought in the past weeks, he said.
   On the stock exchange, the index rose early in the morning,
helped by bargain hunting following its decline Wednesday. But its
strength did not last because of widespread pessimism and
uncertainties in the market due to recent declines, traders said.
   Masashi Wakabayashi, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
a newspaper report about expected losses among medium-sized
securities houses during the first half of fiscal 1990, which ends
Sept. 30, also discouraged investors.
   ``Although many people basically had expected poor business
performance by the securities houses, when they actually saw it
reported, investors, especially individuals, got discouraged,'' he
said.

   The National Enquirer may let Lisa
Bonet's lawyers look over a photographic negative of her baby
daughter to prove her claim against a drugstore chain.
   Bonet contends the negative was sold to the tabloid by a Reseda,
Calif., drugstore clerk from a roll of the actress' film brought in
for developing.
   The Enquirer initially refused to let lawyers see the negative,
but they may now allow a peek, said William Weston, a lawyer for
the American Drug Stores Inc. chain.
   Bonet's attorneys said the negative will prove the clerk stole
it to sell to the newspaper.
   ``We're trying to work things out of court,'' said Ralph Loeb,
one of Bonet's lawyers.
   The Enquirer was not named in the lawsuit over the photo it
published in 1989 of Bonet's then month-old baby, Zoe Kravitz.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Ricky Skaggs' children get around.
   The country singer said Tuesday he picked up the nickname ``Mr.

summer.
   ``They rode one of the top 10 roller coasters in the country at
Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, saw the rodeo in Cheyenne (Wyoming)
and have hit the midways at the Montana and South Dakota state
fairs,'' Skaggs said.
   The children range in age from 6 months to 12 years.
   Skaggs is known for such hits as ``Country Boy'' and ``Lovin'

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A Hollywood producer wants to base a TV
drama on the life and times of Lamar Alexander, ex-governor turned
university president.
   ``It would be a one-hour (weekly) story with multiple

would be president of the university.''
   Schwartz, producer of such films as ``Coal Miner's Daughter''
and ``Sweet Dreams,'' said he is trying to sell the networks on the

   Alexander, a Republican, was governor of Tennessee for eight
years. He left office in 1986 and became president of the
University of Tennessee.
   Alexander said Wednesday he likes the idea for the show.

   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Industrialist Victor Posner, sentenced
to community service for the homeless in a tax evasion case, has
given $607,000 to the cause.
   Posner, chairman of Royal Crown Cola Co., handed over a check
Wednesday to be split by the National Coalition for the Homeless
and a Los Angeles-based homeless group.
   Posner pleaded no contest in 1988 to evading $1.2 million in
federal taxes by fraudulently inflating the value of land he
donated to a college in the 1970s.
   He was fined $4 million and ordered to give $3 million to the
homeless. He was also ordered to perform 5,000 hours of community
service related to the homeless. Court records show he has not
completed the work.
   Royal Crown spokesman Phil Dudek said the contribution was
unrelated to Posner's tax case.

   George Steinbrenner says he misses the
Yankees, and he still resents Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent for
his lifetime ban.
   ``I'd love to be back up at the stadium,'' the former boss of
the Yankees said in a recent interview. ``I miss my players and the
player talk.''
   Steinbrenner said he did nothing to justify even a suspension
and that he volunteered to step aside from day-to-day management of
the team only because Vincent was going to suspend him for two
years anyway.
   ``It was not a punishment; it was an agreement, pure and
simple,'' Steinbrenner said.
   While he accepts the consequences, he adds, ``I'm not happy with
the way the agreement is turning out.''
   Vincent ruled July 30 that Steinbrenner violated the rules of
baseball in paying $40,000 to a gambler, allegedly to dig up dirt
on a ballplayer.

<HEAD>Shrimping Limits Debated Along the Gulf Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to curtail the Gulf Coast
shrimping season to protect red snapper that get caught up and die
in shrimp nets would imperil a $1.2 billion industry, shrimpers
say.
   ``I'd like to see you close your business down for three months
and make a living,'' Texas Shrimp Association president Harry
Lassaigne argued Wednesday at a hearing of the Gulf of Mexico
Fishery Management Council.
   The council, made up of federal and state fishery officials from
five Gulf Coast states, was expected to vote today on a proposal to
ban trawling in May, June and July, beginning next year.
   On Tuesday, a sub-panel of the council voted down the proposal.
But the vote was non-binding.
   Government marine researchers say red snapper stocks are
dwindling rapidly, with 10 million to 12 million of the fish dying
in shrimp nets each year.
   The shrimp association disputes those figures because sampling
of bycatch - unwanted species caught in shrimp nets - stopped in
1982, and argues that curtailing trawling would endanger an
industry that employs 137,000 people along the Gulf Coast.
   Fishermen argued, however, that the gulf's snapper industry is
in greater need of protecting.
   ``The Gulf of Mexico isn't a limitless source of fish,'' Florida
fisherman Bob Zales said. ``The bycatch is a definite problem. If
you're not going to do anything about the bycatch of shrimpers,
it's not fair to impose quotas on others.''
   Zales and other charter boat operators said they already face
limits on the number of red snapper they can catch in Florida
waters and elsewhere.
   ``You can't expect me to suffer more economic difficulty while
someone's nets drag the bottom and kill baby fish,'' Zales said.
   About 500 people attended Wednesday's hearing, including 75
shrimpers of Valley Interfaith, a political action group from Port
Isabel, Texas. At least 90 percent of that town's 8,000 residents
are employed in the shrimping industry.

<HEAD>New Job? Great, But What's That Smell?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sweet smell of success is wafting from the
city's trash, with more than 100,000 New Yorkers applying for jobs
as sanitation workers.
   It's a record turnout of applicants for any city job, officials
said Wednesday, and at least one of them thinks he knows why.
   ``For somebody who likes the outdoors, it's a good, clean
living,'' said Sanitation Department spokesman Vito Turso. ``You
can build up your muscles, and then get them tanned.''
   Sure. But what makes people look at garbage and see gold?
   Try $23,104 per year to start, with the salary climbing to
$35,000 after five years. Add in overtime, and a likely raise with
the next city contract, and it's obvious all that smells doesn't
necessarily stink.
   The job requirements are minimal: a driver's license and a
strong back. The work week is 35 hours, with the shift running from
7 a.m. to 3 p.m.; summer hours let workers out at 2 p.m. As with
most city jobs, there are comprehensive benefits.
   Negatives? The average city sanitation worker lifts five tons of
garbage per day, the rough equivalent of two Toyotas. And the odds
of bagging a position are 50-to-1.
   As of Wednesday, 102,000 people had registered to take the
written test this Saturday. Of those who pass, 15,000 will be
selected randomly by computer and given the physical test.
Eventually, 2,000 will be hired over the next four years, city
budgets permitting.
   Virtually all are expected to pass the written test, which is
basically trash-specific.
   ``It's mostly reading comprehension. They receive manuals on
operating the trucks and safety, and the questions deal with
that,'' Turso explained. ``For example, which button do you push to
start the truck? Button A. Like that.''
   When the test was last given in 1983, nearly 95 percent of the
88,000 applicants passed the written part.
   The physical test is a bit heavier. Potential trash-carriers
last time had 27 minutes to load 147 sacks of simulated garbage -
2,975 pounds worth - into a hopper set at the height of a garbage
truck.
   Each applicant has paid a $15 fee to take the written test
despite the long odds. Other than that, they might have little in
common: the applicants cross all lines of sex and age, with
potential employees coming from all walks of life, Turso said.
   ``We've had individuals come out in their 50s, gray haired,
grandchildren in tow,'' said Turso. ``And some of them have
actually been called up.''

<HEAD>Russian Parliament Calls For Prime Minister to Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russian republic's parliament today
overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his Cabinet to resign, calling them unable
to save the country from economic ruin.
   The measure, passed on a 164-1 vote with 16 abstentions, said
Ryzhkov's government ``is not capable of pulling the country out of
its deep economic crisis.''
   The Russian body called on the national parliament, or Supreme
Soviet, to ``solve the question of the resignation of the entire
government of the USSR.''
   The resolution was referring to the Council of Ministers and not
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has backed a sweeping 500-day
program that would bring quicker market-oriented reform than
Ryzhkov has called for.
   The Russian parliament last week threw its support behind the
500-day plan.
   The national Supreme Soviet is now considering whether to
approve it or one of two other major proposals. Ryzhkov presented
his proposal, the most conservative, to the national body last
week.
   Russia is by far the largest of the country's 15 republics -
home to half the Soviet people - and its lawmakers have
considerable influence in the national Supreme Soviet, which is to
meet Monday.
   Under Soviet law, the national parliament could call an
extraordinary meeting of its parent body, the Congress of Peoples
Deputies, which by a two-thirds vote has the right to force the
prime minister and his Cabinet out of office.
   Ryzhkov has been under fire for months amid increasing shortages
of basic goods the Communist system has been unable to produce in
sufficient quantity.
   ``The people are living worse each year,'' said Ilya
Konstantinov, a Russian parliament lawmaker from Leningrad.
   ``It's obvious that the Ryzhkov government could not and cannot
correct the problem. It's also obvious that the Ryzhkov government
is opposed to adopting the radical program of economic reforms,''
he said.
   The Russian action today came four days after thousands of
demonstrators marched in Moscow and demanded Ryzhkov's resignation,
citing the failing economy. Many also called for Gorbachev to
resign.
   Ryzhkov has acknowledged publicly that his government will not
be able to implement the more radical, 500-day plan, and he
indicated he would resign if the national parliament were to vote
for it.
   Ryzhkov's plan envisions continued central control of the
economy while gradual moves are made toward a market-based system.
   The 500-day plan backed by the Russian parliament would return
land to private farmers, sell government enterprises to private
stockholders and gradually remove state-controlled prices on many
goods.
   It would transfer most economic authority from the central
government to the 15 Soviet republics, most of which are pushing
for greater sovereignty or independence.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise plan that contains many
elements of the 500-day blueprint, but would move more slowly and
leave the central goverment with strong powers, including the
ability to levy taxes in the republics.
   Ryzhkov, 60, became prime minister in 1985, and he has often
been seen in public next to the Soviet leader.

<TEXT>
   Fraternities at the University of
Pennsylvania, their image tarnished by a series of crimes and
pranks, have adopted a ``bring your own booze'' policy for parties.
   ``We are attempting to take control of a dangerous situation
before it takes control of us,'' said Bret Kinsella, a member of
Kappa Sigma and president of the Intrafraternity Council.
   The policy, announced Tuesday, calls for professional doormen at
all parties to check that guests are of legal drinking age. Guests
cannot bring in more than 12 bottles of beer or an equivalent
amount of alcohol.
   The frat will store the booze and distribute drinks using a
ticket system.
   In recent years, pranks, an alleged gang rape and a kidnapping
have hurt the image of the Ivy League school's 31 fraternities.
   One reason for the new policy, Kinsella said, was increasing
liability insurance, ranging from $65 to $350 a year per member.
   ``We think it is a very responsible action in light of the
issues of risk and liability they face,'' said Kim Morrisson, vice
provost for university life. But she said, ``There will have to be
some further discussion of amounts.''
   Bill Epstein, assistant to university President Sheldon Hackney,
said 12 beers sounded ``a little on the fluid side.''

<HEAD>Man Arrested For Impersonating High School Cheerleader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A female impersonator enrolled at
a high school, made the cheerleading squad and stole the affections
of the football team before being found out eight days later,
students and authorities said.
   Charles James Daugherty, 26, was arrested for investigation of
forgery and criminal impersonation. He was released on $750 bail
for a court appearance Oct. 1.
   Daugherty enrolled as a junior at Coronado High School, using
the name Cheyen Weatherly, school officials said. He said he had
been studying in Greece under a private tutor for the past two
years, said Detective Bob Driscoll.
   Daugherty became a cheerleader without a formal tryout and
performed in uniform at a pep rally, teachers and students said. He
changed clothes in the women's locker room and became close friends
with at least two cheerleaders.
   ``I heard there were a couple of girls who befriended him and
told him a lot of personal things - you know how girls talk to one
another,'' said one teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``He asked a lot of personal stuff.''
   He also attracted the admiration of the football team, said a
student who asked that her name not be used.
   Police said Daugherty presented school officials with a
computerized list of courses he had completed and grades to match -
all A's and B's. School officials initially were skeptical but
allowed him to enroll until more detailed records could be
obtained.
   ``Meanwhile, things started to unravel for him,'' Driscoll said.
   Daugherty is described as 5-foot-9 and 164 pounds - a build that
made teachers and students look twice.
   School officials increasingly became suspicious and decided to
check telephone numbers and addresses Daugherty had provided.
Police were called to the school when administrators concluded the
information was false.
   ``This guy's good,'' Driscoll said. ``The school, I think, was
pretty astute in catching him as fast as they did.''

<HEAD>Leading Security Council Members Back Air Embargo Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the Security
Council have drafted a resolution that would impose a stiff air
embargo on Iraq, prohibiting planes from delivering all but
humanitarian cargo.
   The full 15-member council is expected to vote on the measure
Friday or Saturday, diplomats said. It is virtually assured passage
because only the five permament members - Britain, France, the
United States, Soviet Union and China - have veto power on the
council.
   The resolution says no state shall permit any aircraft of any
nation to fly over its territory to or from Iraq or Kuwait, unless
the aircraft lands for inspection and possible detention.
   It does not call for the use of force.
   The draft resolution also calls for detention of
Iraqi-registered ships in foreign ports if they are violating the
existing U.N.-ordered embargo on trade.
   The resolution says all states, despite their international
obligations, shall not permit their airlines to operate any
scheduled or non-scheduled flights to or from Iraq or Kuwait if
they carry cargo other than medical or humanitarian food supplies.
   It also prohibits any aircraft registered in Iraq or under
charter to a national of Iraq to land in foreign territory with
unauthorized cargo which is not part of a mercy flight.
   Diplomats said the language of the resolution was being refined
and it still must be considered by the nonaligned and other states
before a formal council session.
   The resolution also warns of further unspecified steps, saying
the council is putting the government of Iraq on notice that its
continued failure to comply with (Security Council resolutions)
will lead the council to take further action under the U.N. Charter
``with potentially severe consequences.''
   It confirms that the existing trade embargo approved by the
council applies to all means of transport, including aircraft.
   U.N. officials, meanwhile, said Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar was willing to talk to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad about a peaceful solution to the crisis - but only if the
session could be productive.
   PLO Leader Yassser Arafat has said earlier that Saddam was
prepared to negotiate a political solution to the crisis with Perez
de Cuellar.
   Francois Giuliani, the secretary-general's spokesman, said Perez
de Cuellar had not been approached by Arafat.
   ``If he had an invitation to go to Baghdad and felt it would be
useful, without raising false expectations and with some indication
of flexibility ... then, of course, he is prepared to go.''
   The secretary-general on Tuesday expressed frustration about his
recent talks in Amman, Jordan, with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz. He said he had seen no movement toward dialogue to defuse the
crisis.

   Jewish leaders saw both danger and hope on the
horizon as they began the High Holidays.
   Thankfulness was expressed at the crumbling of communism in
Eastern Europe and swelling emigration to freedom of Soviet Jews,
but there was anxiety over the war clouds in the Middle East.
   Citing earlier hopeful signs in the world - the loosening of the
``deadly clutch'' of the superpowers and receding of the ``threat
of a nuclear holocaust,'' Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler said:
   ``The guns of August changed all that. Their thunder reminded us
that aggression still menaces humankind and that free nations must
be ready to resist it.''
   Schindler, president of Reform Judaism's Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, said Israel ``is at special risk.''
   ``Just as anti-Semitism was the cement that bound the Nazi
cnspiracy, so does (Iraq's Saddam) Hussein seek to unite the Arab
world with his anti-Israel war cries,'' he said.
   However, he said there is ``one shaft of light in an otherwise
gloomy sky'' - that the threat of Iraq will impel other Arab states
to join Egypt in reaching an understanding with Israel.
   The High Holidays, beginning with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New
Year, on Wednesay night, are marked with synagogue services and
prayers of repentance and resolve to do better in the year ahead.
   The 10-period ends at the close of Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement, at sundown Sept. 29.
   Sholom D. Comay, president of the American Jewish Committee,
expressed gratification at the end of the Cold War and moves toward
greater democracy.
   ``But we see also that many old patterns remain,'' he said,
including anti-Semitism and dangerous forms of nationalism in
Eastern Europe.
   He urged prayers that the international intervention by East and
West and by Arab and non-Arab nations against Saddam would
``succeed and succeed peacefully.''
   ``We cannot allow him to hold the world hostage,'' Comay said.
   In a similar vein, Kent E. Schiner, president of B'nai B'rith
International, said that although ``crises are by nature fraught
with danger, they also often bring opportunity.''
   ``We hope and pray that the changing world order we are
witnessing will indeed herald new prospects for peace, security and
stability in the Middle East, and especially for our brethren in
Israel,'' he said.

   A man charged with sexually assaulting his
5-year-old grandnephew told investigators he has molested as many
as 1,000 children over the last 40 years, police say.
   George Riley, a 57-year-old handyman, made his claim while being
questioned in custody, authorities said Wednesday. He is being held
on $1 million bail.
   Maureen McHale, spokeswoman for the Cook County State's
Attorney's office, refused to say whether authorities in the office
believed Riley had molested so many children.
   But she said, ``We will investigate thoroughly any allegation by
anyone or any admission by anyone that they have committed''
crimes.
   Investigators have begun interviewing an unspecified number of
people who may have been molested by Riley, Hale said.
   Riley was picked up Sunday after a witness alleged he saw him
molesting a boy in a car parked in suburban Calumet City, said
Steven Rhoads, police chief there. He said the victim was Riley's
grandnephew.
   Dante Zorzi, a Calumet City investigator, said he gained Riley's
confidence while questioning him. Riley claimed to have molested as
many as 1,000 children since he was a teen-ager, police said.
   ``We do not know if that's exaggeration,'' Rhoads said.

<HEAD>Advice for the Pregnant: Don't Spend More Than 10 Minutes in Hot
Tub</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pregnant women who enjoy relaxing in the hot tub
shouldn't stay in more than 10 minutes, says a study published
today.
   Too much tub time can raise a woman's body temperature enough to
cause malformations in the fetus, said the study, appearing as a
letter in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   According to the latest research, pregnant women should not
spend any more than 10 minutes in a tub when the water is 104
degrees.
   To reach this conclusion, the researchers conducted an
experiment on 24 young, non-pregnant women to see how long it takes
for their inner-body temperature to reach 102, the point that can
be hazardous to the fetus.
   They found that some people heat up twice as fast as others. In
a 104-degree tub, some women's bodies reached 102 in as little as
12 minutes, while others took 23 minutes.
   They also found that half of the women did not feel
uncomfortably hot when their temperatures hit 102.
   ``We conclude that at least in non-pregnant women, subjective
discomfort is not wholly reliable as a safeguard against
overheating, and that time limits should also be used,'' the
researchers wrote.
   The study was conducted in Australia by Barry R. Ridge of the
University of Western Sydney-Macarthur and Dr. Grahame M. Budd of
the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety in Sydney.

<HEAD>High Keating Bail Caught Prosecutors by Surprise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Hearing scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors surprised by a judge's decision
to set bail at $5 million for Charles H. Keating Jr. on savings and
loan fraud charges agreed to a hearing today on lowering the
amount.
   For District Attorney Ira Reiner and his staff, the high bail
set Tuesday by Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner came as something
of a shock.
   In negotiating Keating's surrender, prosecutors told the defense
the bail decision would be left to the judge, but they indicated
the amount would probably be far lower.
   ``When the judge set it at $5 million, we were probably as
surprised as Mr. Keating,'' said Mike Botula, a Reiner spokesman.
   Keating and three co-defendants, whose bail was set at $1
million each, remained in jail in the first criminal case stemming
from the $2 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan, the
nation's biggest S&amp;L failure.
   They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
   Keating, a 66-year-old developer from Paradise Valley, Ariz.,
headed Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix.
   The defendants were accused of swindling junk-bond investors by
misrepresenting the safety of the investments. All told, more than
20,000 investors are believed to have lost $250 million on the now
virtually worthless securities.
   The judge, in setting bail, said he considered the charges
serious.
   Afterward, posecutors agreed to waive the normal five-day wait
before a bail reduction hearing.
   Keating became a prominent symbol of the nation's S&amp;L scandal
because of his lavish personal habits, his risky investments, his
political access and the high cost of bailing out Lincoln.

<HEAD>Boarding Home Fire Kills Four; Teen Rescues 10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BESSEMER, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school football player says he
dragged or carried 10 people to safety when fire raced through a
wooden boarding house for the elderly and infirm, klling four
residents.
   Shawn Bates, 16, said he ran from room to room to evacuate the
home early Wednesday but was unable to reach the last four people.
``I thank God for the people I got out and I wish I could have done
more for the other people,'' he said.
   The fire at the one-story home was reported at 2:30 a.m., said
fire Capt. Richard Davis.
   When firefighters arrived, Bates already had rescued 10 of the
15 residents and one woman had escaped on her own. ``Of the four
fatalities, two were in wheelchairs and all four were invalids,''
Davis said.
   One of the dead, William C. Bigham, 31, had been badly burned in
a mission fire in Chicago five years ago and ``made me promise if
there ever was a fire there, I would get him out. But I couldn't
get him out,'' Bates said.
   Bates said he used to carry Bigham, who suffered from cerebral
palsy, wherever he needed to go. The two watched often television
together and talked about hunting and fishing.
   ``I kind of thought I let him down,'' Bates said. ``I believe
now he understands. He knows I would have gotten to him if I could
have.''
   Bates said he was sleeping in the boarding house while visiting
his mother, who operates the home and lives next door.
   He said he was awoken by a fire alarm and when he ran out of his
room, he found the fire had been started by an elderly man smoking
on a couch. Bates said the man fought with him, but he managed to
drag him from the building.
   Bates was treated for smoke inhalation at Bessemer Carraway
Hospital.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today in volatile trading affected by a rumor involving the
Persian Gulf crisis, traders said.
   Share prices fell after a morning rally, sending the Nikkei
Stock Average to its lowest closing level in 2{ years.
   The dollar closed at 137.05 yen, down 1 yen from Wednesday's
138.05-yen finish. It opened at 137.20 yen and ranged between
136.45 yen and 137.40 yen.
   After opening lower, the U.S. currency fluctuated nervously,
influenced by a rumor that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had begun efforts
to settle the crisis, dealers said.
   ``The rumor, initially believed by Japanese investors,
temporarily boosted the yen around noon to 136.45 yen per dollar,''
said Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank. ``But the dollar
narrowed its losses after the rumor later turned out to be
groundless, and discouraged participants started to pick up the
U.S. currency again.''
   Naohiko Yasuda, a Bank of Tokyo dealer, attributed the dollar's
weakness to the yen's strength in cross trading against European
currencies.
   The dollar strengthened earlier this week when investors began
selling yen they had overbought in recent weeks, but they once
again started buying the Japanese currency, he said.
   An estimated $12.8 billion traded hands in spot trading.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
123.19 points, or 0.52 percent, ending the day at 23,602.98. The
index, which lost 158.65 points on Wednesday, closed at its lowest
level since Feb. 3, 1988, when it ended trading at 23,595.37.
   Trading was thin, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 360 million shares, down from 400 million on
Wednesday.
   The index, which started higher, helped by bargain hunting,
erased its early gains when pessimism and uncertainties about the
market discouraged investors, traders said.
   ``Although the Nikkei narrowed its losses early in the afternoon
due to the higher yen, it failed to bounce back because of the
market's pessimism,'' said Sadayoshi Kiuchi, an analyst with Nomura
Securities Co.
   ``We think the market is about to hit bottom, but investors were
still reluctant to increase their holdings in an attempt to avoid
risks ahead of account settlements for the first half of fiscal
1990,'' he said. The first half of the fiscal year ends Sept. 30
for most Japanese companies.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.570 percent, up from
Wednesday's close of 8.535 percent. Their price closed at 81.19
points, down from 81.34 Wednesday.

   A man stole $1 million worth of animation
cels from a Warner Bros storage area, including pictures of Bugs
Bunny, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, prosecutors say.
   A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted Billy Carmen on charges of
interstate transportation of stolen goods.
   Carmen, 31, of Studio City was accused of shipping 233 cels to
out-of-state dealers. He faces up to 30 years in prison and
$750,000 in fines.
   Cels are the plastic, painted overlays used by the thousands to
create an animated film.
   Carmen stole tens of thousands of cels from the storage area in
Burbank, Assistant U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said Wednesday.
   Carmen had a chocolate shop in the same building, which he left
in 1988 without paying rent about the same time the cels
disappeared, Ms. Haag said.

   AIDS activists and other demonstrators
rattled police barricades, screamed obscenities and hurled bagels
and lasagna noodles outside a hotel during a visit by President
Bush. Police arrested 85 people.
   About 500 demonstrators faced off with hundreds of officers in
riot gear Wednesday.
   Police said many in the crowd were anti-war activists protesting
the U.S. buildup in the Middle East.
   But most of those arrested belonged to ACT-Up, the AIDS
Coalition To Unleash Power, which accuses Bush of ignoring a
commission's recommendation to speed approval of various new drugs,
including some for AIDS patients.
   The commission is headed by Dr. Louis Lasagna - thus, the noodle
tossing. The significance of the other food hurled wasn't
immediately known.
   Bush was at the hotel for a $1,500-a-plate fund-raiser for
Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson, who is locked
in a close race with former Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
   Among the chants were ``Fifteen hundred dollars a plate - AIDS
won't wait'' and ``Bush and Quayle belong in jail.''
   Protesters were arrested for failure to disperse and unlawful
assembly, and were released, police said.

   American and other evacuees from Kuwait
who arrived in Britain on an Iraqi jet say food and medical
supplies are running short in Kuwait, garbage is piled in the
streets and rats are a growing problem.
   A total of 416 evacuees, many of them women and children,
arrived on an Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 at Gatwick Airport outside
London shortly before midnight.
   A State Department spokesman in Washington said they included
110 Americans, accompanied by about 200 of their foreign-born
family members.
   Also on the plane, which was chartered by the U.S. government
and had flown from Kuwait to Baghdad earlier Wednesday, were 37
Britons and five Canadians.
   The remaining evacuees on the plane were Jordanians, Egyptians,
Palestinians, Icelanders, Spaniards, Greeks, Kenyans and
Indonesians.
   The spokesman said the Americans and their family members, who
spent the night in hotels in and around Gatwick, would fly today to
Raleigh-Durham, N.C. on another plane chartered by the U.S.
government.
   The British news agency Press Association said Iraqis heading
home from Britain were due to join the Iraqi Airways plane at
Gatwick for its return flight to Baghdad.
   Britain on Monday ordered the expulsion of two military attaches
and six support staff from the Iraqi Embassy in London and 23 other
Iraqis in Britain in retaliation for Iraqi intrusions into some
Western embassies in Kuwait.
   Among those escaping Kuwait was a man who would only give his
name as Hassan, who said he was from Salt Lake City and had lived
in Kuwait for the last three years.
   He said: ``Conditions are terrible there. Food and medicine are
scarce. There is almost nothing. We have got water but that is
about all.
   ``Kuwait City is dirty. Sickness will probably spread very
quickly if nobody cleans the town. Right now they are burning the
garbage but the rats are getting really bad.''
   He added: ``Kuwait this morning (Wednesday) was calm but we have
heard firing, especially at night.''
   Heidi Hadi from Layton, Utah who said she had lived in Kuwait
for five years, arrived at Gatwick with her 11-month-old son
Abdullah. She said her Kuwaiti husband, who worked for the Kuwaiti
Interior Ministry, was still there.
   ``They (the Iraqis) have burned and stolen everything,'' she
said. ``They have raped young Kuwaiti girls as young as 14, 15 and
16.''
   She said Kuwaiti resistance fighters included both men and women
but she said the numbers involved in the fighting against Iraqi
troops following the Aug. 2 invasion were small.
   She said some Iraqi soldiers felt guilty about being in Kuwait.
``There are Iraqis not happy to be there. (These) soldiers, they
cry, they grab children and say, `You look like my daughter. I want
to go home. I don't want to be here.' ''

   Mark and Crispina Calvert, the couple who hired Johnson to carry
the baby for $10,000, visited the infant Wednesday night.
   ``It looks like us,'' Mrs. Calvert said.
   ``It's got my nose and real straight, brownish hair,'' Calvert
said.
   Months ago, Johnson backed out of the deal and sued the couple
for custody.
   The outcome of the case could be a groundbreaking ruling over
what constitutes parenthood - the child's genetic makeup or the act
of bearing a child - or a narrow custody decision focused on the
child's best interests.
   Arguments in the case, originally set for Sept. 27, were
rescheduled for Friday.
   Johnson, 29, who knew Mrs. Calvert, 36, from a Santa Ana
hospital where they both worked as nurses, claims the couple's
enthusiasm for the pregnancy waned.
   The Calverts did not visit Johnson at St. Joseph's Hospital
after the birth but left her a bouquet of red roses.
   ``It's extremely uplifting,'' said Richard C. Gilbert, Johnson's
lawyer. ``Even in the middle of this mess, it's still so exciting.
Anna is in heaven.''
   William Steiner, the child's legal guardian, ordered hospital
officials not to release the baby until a judge decides who will
have temporary custody, said Harold F. LaFlamme, the infant's
court-appointed lawyer.
   Under Steiner's orders, the hospital will ``treat the baby as if
he has three parents,'' LaFlamme said.
   Johnson was implanted with an embryo conceived from Crispina's
egg and Mark's sperm.
   Attorneys for the Calverts say she is the first surrogate mother
to sue for custody rights even though she has no genetic link to
the child she delivered.
   The case differs from the Baby M case in New Jersey because that
child was conceived by a surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead,
with the sperm of a man, William Stern, whose wife couldn't have a
baby.
   Whitehead sued for custody of the child and lost.
   Gilbert said Wednesday his client will agree to a ``shared
parenting arrangement'' under which the baby could spend time with
Johnson and the Calverts.
   LaFlamme said he has obtained a court order for immediate DNA
testing of the baby to confirm its parentage. Johnson's attorneys
have raised the possibility that the embryo implant did not take
and the baby is hers genetically.
   Johnson calls the child Matthew. Nurses at the Orange hospital
call him Baby Boy Johnson. Mrs. Calvert said she and her husband
want to name the child Michael Christian.
   ``I'm real excited, but I'm also worried,'' Mrs. Calvert said.
``I know in my heart that he's our bab, but there's still the
question, what if we don't win? What if we don't get him?''

   Police were searching today for two
masked men who broke into the Iraqi ambassador's residence,
ransacked his private office and knocked an employee unconscious, a
police spokesman said.
   The spokesman said no arrests had been made and it was not clear
if any files or documents were missing from the house. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The diplomat could not confirm whether the ambassador kept
official documents in the office, the police spokesman said.
Although the break-in looked like a simple burglary, political
motives cannot be ruled out, he said.
   The two men entered the villa of Ambassador Rahim Abid Alkital
in Vienna's Hernals district on Wednesday afternoon. They slipped
by police guards, cut through a barbed wire fence and forced a
window, police said.
   They clubbed unconscious a 26-year-old Sri Lankan employee at
the residence who saw them entering. They then ransacked the
ambassador's office and a neighboring room before escaping, the
spokesman said.
   The ambassador's wife found the unidentified employee when she
returned to the residence at 6:30 p.m. The employee was tied up and
suffering from a concussion, the police spokesman said.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Gives Lebanon $100 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has given Lebanon $100
million to help it cope with the civil war-ravaged economy that was
aggravated by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a government statement
said today.
   Saudi Arabia informed Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday
night that Saudi King Fahd personally ordered the cash transfer to
the Lebanese Central Bank, the statement said.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``the gift was a tranquilizer,'' which will help avoid a further
deterioration of the economic situation, but not resolve the
problem.
   ``It will definitely help rebuild some sort of confidence for
the future,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Iraqi invasion sabotaged plans for a $2 billion Arab fund to
shore up a Lebanese economy wracked by 15 years of sectarian
fighting that has claimed 130,000 lives. Contributors were to be
the oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf, including Kuwait.
   But after Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, focus shifted away
from Lebanon as Saudi Arabia and its gulf Arab neighbors began
channeling money to help Kuwaiti refugees and finance multinational
forces massing up against Iraq.
   The Lebanese pound plunged to a record low of 1,200 pounds to
the dollar in recent days. It sold for 600 to the dollar before the
gulf crisis.
   The prices of commodities have tripled or quadrupled over the
last two weeks.
   The government-decreed minimum wage of 45,000 Lebanese pounds a
month is now worth $40 compared to more than $80 in late July.
   Lebanon's deficit of the 1990 fiscal year was estimated at $50
million.
   The dollar marked a slow decline against the pound today,
opening at 1,100 pounds to the dollar in the money market.
   The Lebanese pound was one of the soundest Middle Eastern
currencies before the outbreak of its civil war between Moslems and
Christians in 1975. It traded at 2.5 pounds to the dollar.
   President Elias Hrawi last week appealed to Fahd to spearhead an
Arab campaign aimed at providing Lebanon with urgent aid to ward
off ``the dangers of starvation and poverty threatening the
Lebanese society.''
   The Arab League's trouble-shooter, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an
Algerian, has been campaigning in the Arab world and Europe to add
Lebanon to the list of countries hardest-hit by the gulf crisis,
which now includes Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.

<HEAD>Dollar Dives Against Yen, Gold Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to sink against the Japanese
yen in European trading this morning and was mixed against other
key currencies. Gold was down slightly.
   In Tokyo the dollar closed at 137.05 yen, down 1.00 yen from
Wednesday's 138.05-yen finish. Later in London it was quoted at
136.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.5700 German marks, up from 1.5680
   -1.3080 Swiss francs, up from 1.3055
   -5.2615 French francs, up from 5.2515
   -1.7720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7670
   -1,171.00 Italian lire, down from 1,172.50
   -1.1538 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1575
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8765, compared
with $1.8855 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo the dollar fluctuated nervously, influenced by a rumor
that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had begun efforts to settle the Persian
Gulf crisis, dealers said.
   ``The rumor, initially believed by Japanese investors,
temporarily boosted the yen around noon to 136.45 yen per dollar,''
said Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank. ``But the dollar
narrowed its losses after the rumor later turned out to be
groundless, and discouraged participants started to pick up the
U.S. currency again.''
   Naohiko Yasuda, a Bank of Tokyo dealer, attributed the dollar's
weakness to the yen's strength in cross-trading against European
currencies.
   The dollar strengthened earlier this week when investors began
selling yen they had overbought in recent weeks, but they once
again started buying the Japanese currency, he said.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$386.00 per ounce at midmorning, down from $386.75 bid per ounce
late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.70, up from $385.50 late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 44 cents an ounce today, to close at
$384.91.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.80 a troy ounce,
from Wednesday's $4.82.

   Younis Bazzi climbed a cliff in Beirut
overlooking the Mediterranean last week and flung himself onto the
rocks below. He was Lebanon's first fatality in the gulf crisis.
   Bazzi, 45, a Shiite Moslem cab driver, left a note on the cliff
along with the identity cards of his four children: Imad, 13,
Ilham, 11, Fatima, 9 and Yousef, 6.
   ``I can't cope any more. I can't feed even you, let alone send
you to school,'' the note said. ``I've decided to end my agony.
Good luck to all of you and please forgive me.''
   Bazzi's death was a dramatic example of how Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait has caused more economic and social hardship in
a country already ravaged by 15 years of civil war.
   President Elias Hrawi's government was counting on $2 billion in
reconstruction aid pledged by the oil-rich Arab nations of the
Persian Gulf to help shore up the Lebanese economy.
   ``This hope has been buried in Kuwait's sands,'' said a
commentator on Beirut's Voice of the People radio station. ``No one
can expect anyone in the Arabian peninsula to show concern for
Lebanon. They're preoccupied with the Iraqi threat on their
doorstep.''
   Today, the government said Saudi Arabia gave it $100 million.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``the gift was a tranquilizer,'' which will help avoid a further
deterioration of the economic situation, but not resolve the
problem.
   The invasion of Kuwait sent the Lebanese currency tumbling to a
record low - from 600 pounds to the dollar in late July to 1,100
pounds to the dollar now.
   The prices of commodities have tripled or quadrupled over the
last two weeks. A loaf of bread costs 10 cents, five times what it
cost early last month.
   The worldwide surge in oil prices triggered by the crisis has
been devastating. Lebanon imports all its oil and is now paying
double what it was six weeks ago with foreign currency it can ill
afford.
   It's the same story with such staples as rice, sugar,
vegetables, potatoes, milk and canned food. Lebanon has to import
more than 90 percent of its food.
   The minimum wage of 45,000 Lebanese pounds a month is now worth
$40, compared to more than $80 in late July.
   ``My salary's barely enough to support my wife and two kids for
one day, let alone a whole month,'' lamented Mahmoud Safi, 30, a
minimum-wage bus driver.
   Economists say that the gulf crisis has done as much damage to
the economy, once the most prosperous in the Middle East, as the 15
years of civil war, Israeli invasions and factional feuding put
together.
   Frantic pleas by Hrawi and Prime Minister Salim Hoss to have
Lebanon listed as a hard-hit victim of the gulf crisis so it can
qualify for international compensation have fallen on deaf ears.
   In a recent message to Western heads of state, Hrawi said some
50,000 Lebanese who had been working in Kuwait and sending home
about $200 million a month are now broke.
   One of them, H. Zahreddin, a wealthy businessman, flew to Beirut
on Aug. 1 to throw a wedding party for his daughter at a posh
beachside hotel.
   ``I went to bed a millionaire and woke up in debt,'' Zahreddin
said the next day. ``The hotel refused to accept my Kuwaiti dinar
check to settle the party bill.''
   Another Lebanese resident of Kuwait, Mahmoud Kurdi, drove from
Kuwait to spend his summer vacation at home in the ancient city of
Baalbek in east Lebanon. He crossed the Syrian border into Lebanon
on Aug. 1 and stopped at the market town of Chtaura to cash a bank
check of 50,000 Kuwaiti dinars, roughly $200,000.
   When money-changers there demanded what he considered an
unreasonably high exchange commission, Kurdi decided to cash his
check for a better rate in Beirut the next day. ``But the next day
Saddam Hussein wiped me out,'' Kurdi moaned. ``My check's now a
worthless piece of paper.''
   The currency crisis boomeranged on business. Banks in Beirut
have stopped changing dollar checks, offering only to pay the
equivalent in Lebanese pounds.
   Nightlife that was just starting to pick up again after recent
fighting has come to a virtual standstill. Discotheques and
restaurants are empty. The fun-loving partygoers who defied the
worst civil war shelling in the last two years are staying home.
   ``They just can't afford to go out any more,'' said barman Habib
Naimeh, who runs the Megalith, one of Beirut's most frequented
pubs.

<HEAD>Savannah River Operator Says Reactor Restart May Be Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Savannah River nuclear
arms plant has uncovered up to 2,000 problems in one of the three
reactors that could delay the year-end deadline for restarting
operations, an official said.
   Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which runs the plant for the
government, has discovered the faults since mid-August, said Energy
Department Assistant Secretary Steve Richardson.
   ``It's like taking your car in and the mechanic really starts
working on it and finds more things wrong,'' Richardson said.
``Those things were not anticipated in the schedule, there was no
way you could.''
   The plant, in South Carolina across the Savannah River from
Augusta, has been shut down since August 1988 because of safety
concerns. Westinghouse, which assumed control of the plant from Du
Pont in April 1989, did not specify the nature of the latest
problems.
   Westinghouse and Energy Department officials will recommend to
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins within three weeks whether to
delay the restart, Richardson said.
   ``It's too early to tell whether we would recommend any schedule
changes,'' said Westinghouse spokesman Bruce Cadotte said. ``We are
still going through the analysis with the Department of Energy.''
   In May, Watkins said the reactor would begin low-power testing
in December and start producing materials for nuclear weapons later
that month or early in January. The other two reactors would begin
production by October 1991, he said.
   The Savannah River reactors are the sole producers of tritium, a
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear
weapons. Because it decays 5.5 percent annually, tritium-loaded
warheads must be periodically replenished.

   The 11th tropical depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season continued its westward drift in the mid-Atlantic,
and forecasters expected little change in strength for the system
during the next 24 hours.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression's center was located near 15.9
north latitude and 49.9 west longitude, or about 700 miles east of
the Lesser Antilles, according to the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   The depression, packing top sustained winds of 35 mph, was
moving westward at less than 5 mph. That motion was expected to
continue today and Friday with some increase in forward speed and a
gradual turn likely toward the northwest.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their maximum
winds reach 39 mph.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any violence that might erupt in a city with
strained relations between police and its minorities would only be
defensive, says a county commissioner who had issued a ``call to
arms.''
   Commissioner John Wiley Price, who warned violence would result
if the city hires a ``good old boy'' police chief who's insensitive
to minorities, told a news conference Wednesday evening he was
clarifying - but not apologizing for - the remarks.
   ``And so I say to you today that the call to arms is not an
offensive move - it's not a move of aggression,'' Price said. ``We
will say we will defend our community; historically, we had to
defend our community and we will continue to defend our community.
   ``That does not mean that we are going to be aggressive in going
after police officers in this community. But we are saying to you
that we must defend our community at all costs.''
   Price had made the earlier remarks in an interview published
Wednesday in The Dallas Morning News.
   ``If you try to bring in a good old boy in this system, we're
going to be in the streets. Physically, literally, shooting folks.
We're not going to tolerate it,'' the Dallas County commissioner
said in Wednesday's article.
   He later softened his remarks and told the newspaper he would
advocate violence against police only in the event of officers'
violence against civilians.
   The Dallas County district attorney's office said it was
investigating the legal implications, if any, of Price's statements
on violence. Prosecutors said they had received more than 100
telephone calls about the statements Wednesday.
   ``There is a fine line between what is constitutionally
protected free speech and what is not,'' said Ted Steinke, an
assistant district attorney. ``We are attempting to determine
whether Commissioner Price's words have actually crossed that
line.''
   At the news conference, Price said his statements quoted by the
newspaper were irresponsible and may have been inflammatory.
   ``I don't want anyone to take what I say and take it to the
streets,'' he said. ``At this particular time, taking it to the
streets is inappropriate behavior.''
   He said he was saddened by the firing this month of Chief Mack
Vines, hired in 1988 to mend relations with minorities that were
strained, mostly over a record number of police shootings of blacks
and Hispanics.
   Vines was accused of lying to a special panel investigating the
firing of officer Patrick LeMaire, who fatally shot an unarmed
Mexican national last year. Black and Hispanic leaders had demanded
LeMaire be fired.
   ``There are a number of our friends who are Dallas police
officers,'' Price told reporters. ``I was called by them and they
had some concerns on my remarks. I assured them that in no way do
we plan any kind of assault on the Dallas Police Department,
organized or otherwise, at this moment.''
   Police spokesman Bill Bateman said the department issued a
``chief's update'' on Wednesday warning officers to be on the alert
and to be responsible if they made comments to the press.
   ``I do not think we should do anything in this city that
polarizes the city and creates a hostile environment,'' Mayor
Annette Strauss said of Price's statements.
   City councilwoman Harriet Miers said she hoped churches and
other community organizations would ``let this city know that they
don't like to be threatened and they don't like blackmail and this
kind of behavior is totally unacceptable.''

<HEAD>Parents Sue over Mandatory Community Service In Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of parents is suing a school system
over its new program requiring students to perform 60 hours of
volunteer work.
   ``I don't want my son being told what to do,'' said Thomas
Moralis, one of the plaintiffs, whose son David is in the Bethlehem
Area School District. ``I went to school in a free America, and I
want the same for my children.''
   Moralis and his wife and two other parents filed suit Wednesday
in U.S. District Court against the school board, which approved the
program last spring.
   The lawsuit seeks to end the program and asks that the
defendants pay for legal costs.
   Students are required to work 60 hours, which can be spread over
four years. They choose where they will work from a list approved
last week by the school board.
   School board members defended the program.
   ``I think it is good for our kids,'' said board member John
Spirk, adding that the city solicitor told the board the program
was legal.
   ``The administration researched it, and found it something our
kids ought to be working on,'' he said.
   The parents' lawyer, Robert J. Magee, said the school board used
a similar program in Atlanta as a model, but the high school
dropout rate in Atlanta has increased since the program started.
   The lawsuit said the program was ``inconsistent with certain
values and standards'' the parents hold and it questions the
program's safety.
   Thomas and Barbara Moralis were joined in the suit by Thomas and
Barbara Steirer, whose daughter Lynn Ann is a student.
   The parents are members of a 21-family organization called
Citizens Against Mandatory Service Inc., which is sponsoring the
suit.
   Moralis opposes the choice of organizations, including a
religious group and a hospital operating room, and said the
students may have to pay a fee to join one group or to buy a
uniform.
   ``Some can't afford this,'' he said.
   Moralis said he does not oppose community service.
   ``The school administration said that they don't care if they
perform community service ever again after they graduate,'' Moralis
added. ``It's destroying whatever good will and helpful attitude
there existed in the community.''

<TEXT>
   The United States today offered to
reduce its troop strength in the Philippines but expressed hope it
could maintain a military presence ``which both countries would
judge appropriate.''
   U.S. negotiators made the offer during the third day of talks on
the future of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations, whose lease expires in September 1991.
   Philippine negotiators said they wanted to take operational
control of Clark as soon as possible, although the proposed
timetable was unclear. Philippine spokesman Rafael Alunan said the
government was waiting for a U.S. counterproposal.
   U.S. spokesman Stanley Schrager told reporters that the American
team, led by chief negotiator Richard Armitage, outlined its
proposals for a military presence after 1991.
   ``We would hope that the relationship would continue with
appropriate U.S. access to and use of the Philippine facilities,
together with a U.S. military presence, which both countries would
judge appropriate to meet our needs,'' Schrager said.
   The discussions were to continue Friday. Alunan said the talks
were expected to be adjourned then to an undetermined date.
   Earlier today, Alunan said President Corazon Aquino would order
the dismantling of the six U.S. military bases unless
U.S.-Philippine talks produce an agreement by January.
   ``If there is no treaty or arrangement, let's say by January,
... then we will most likely create a committee that will oversee
the dismantling of the base,'' Alunan said.
   ``It is important for us to have a treaty or an arrangement,''
he said in a radio interview. ``If there is no understanding,
nothing will come of the bases such that by Sept. 16, 1991, they
will have to leave.''
   The United States maintains 40,000 troops, Defense Department
civilians and military dependents at the six bases.
   The bases are technically under Philippine control but are
effectively run by the Americans, who ruled this nation from 1898
until independence in 1946.
   Mrs. Aquino said on the eve of the talks that the time had come
for an orderly withdrawal of the bases, the oldest and largest
American overseas installations.
   Any treaty to keep the bases after the lease runs out requires
approval by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition is
strong. The Philippine Congress could also require the extension to
be approved in a national referendum.
   Opponents, such as Communist rebels, believe the bases infringe
on national sovereignty.
   In Washington, the State Department warned Americans in the
Philippines of ``a possible imminent terrorist bombing'' by the
communist New People's Army against U.S. government or other public
facilities in Manila.
   A brief statement attributed to spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the danger was greatest ``in the vicinity of Roxas
Boulevard,'' where the U.S. Embassy is located and where talks on
the future of the six U.S. military bases in the Philippines were
being held.
   American civilians said they were contacted by the embassy today
and advised of the alleged threat.
   In a related development, the Aquino government handed out a
10-page pamphlet today to the news media that sought to minimize
the bases' political and economic importance.
   The government primer on the bases says the bases are not needed
to prevent the overthrow of the government. In December, U.S. jets

   The bases' contribution to the economy in 1990 will amount to
``only 1.9 percent'' of the gross national product, the pamphlet
says.
   The bases have created jobs for 130,000 Filipinos.
   The facilities generate child prostitution, AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases, abandoned Amerasian children, drug
addition and dislocation of tribespeople from their ancestral
lands, according to the pamphlet.
   But the pamphlet says that even if the bases are closed, the
Philippines will still be ``committed to continue the friendship
the country has had with the U.S. for decades.''

   A 2-year-old boy who had ``almost every square
inch'' of his body mauled by a pack of dogs was breathing with a
respirator today and in critical condition.
   Steven Selfridge of Saxonburg was attacked by six Rottweilers
while playing with a cousin Tuesday at his grandmother's Butler
County home.
   Surgeons spent eight hours Wednesday reconstructing the boy's
windpipe, one lung, veins and arteries. Another 4{ hours were
needed for plastic surgery on his head, face and neck.
   The dog bites caused massive blood loss and Steven's face was
maimed, said Dr. Max Ramenofsky of Allegheny Hospital. The injuries
were so severe paramedics were unable to find a vein solid enough
for inserting an intravenous needle, he said.
   Rottweilers are known for their strong jaw and thick neck
muscles.
   ``Steven had almost every square inch of his body bit or torn,''
said Dr. Max Ramenofsky of Allegheny General.
   Doctors today watched for signs of infection and said it was too
early to offer opinions on Steven's recovery.
   The boy's 11-year-old cousin, Jamie Ross, threw herself into the
pack but was unable to keep the dogs away from Steven, police said.
She then called police.
   ``She's the real hero here,'' said Chris Jones, a paramedic who
was the first to arrive at the scene. ``At one point she tried to
cover the little boy with her body.''
   Jones eventually dispersed the pack with short bursts from a
carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. The attack lasted at least 10
minutes, Officer John Draper said.
   Jamie was treated for cuts and bruises and released Tuesday from
Butler Memorial Hospital.
   The dogs were kept at the house under a 15-day quarantine order
by the township's dog officer.
   ``Destroying the dogs will be up to the courts,'' Butler
Township Police Chief Gary Garman said.

   Typhoon Flo swept into the Pacific Ocean today
after flooding tens of thousands of homes and roads, causing
landslides and leaving at least 38 people dead or missing, police
said.
   A full night and morning of heavy rains caused flooding and
landslides in western and northern Japan before the typhoon headed
out to sea off the coast of Iwate prefecture.
   The typhoon's three-day rampage through Japan left at least 29
people dead, nine missing and 90 injured, police said. They said 11
of the victims died in a landslide Tuesday night on Amami island in
southern Japan.
   Television stations showed scenes of devastation from throughout
the country, including village streets deep in muddy water,
overturned vehicles and washed out roads.
   The NTV network showed one man in Gifu prefecture using a shovel
to propel a makeshift rowboat made from a box through a flooded
street.
   The typhoon had up to 101 mph winds when it landed in
southwestern Wakayama prefecture, but lost strength as it moved
throughout the archipelago. The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said
damage was reported in 44 of the island nation's 47 prefectures.
   The storm brought high winds and some rain to Tokyo late
Wednesday, but the capital escaped largely unscathed.
   Police said the storm triggered 557 landslides, washed away 31
bridges and washed away or sank 68 boats.
   Ninety-five homes and buildings were destroyed, and another 181
were badly damaged, police said. Nearly 27,000 buildings were
flooded.
   The typhoon flooded or cut roads at 418 locations and railroads
at 31 spots. Airlines canceled 62 flights today and numerous trains
also were canceled or delayed, police said.
   The typhoon was one of the most powerful storms to hit Japan in
recent years. It was nearly as strong as a 1961 typhoon that left
nearly 5,000 people killed and injured, according to Takatoshi
Higuchi of the Fire Defense Agency.
   ``We were lucky because the typhoon somewhat lost its strength
... when it landed,'' Higuchi said.

<TEXT>
   Iraq will knock out Persian Gulf oil fields
if attacked by U.S.-led multinational forces in Saudi Arabia, a
senior Iraqi official said in a statement published today.
   ``Iraq's strategic plan, if it is attacked militarily, is to
destroy all oil fields in the region,'' Information Minister Latif
Nassayef Jassim said.
   He added: ``Iraq will use all weapons at its disposal to respond
to any aggression'' that might be launched to force its occupation
force to relinquish Kuwait.
   His remarks were published by the English-language daily Jordan
Times. The newspaper said Jassim made the threat to a group of
Jordanian journalists who visited Iraq this week.
   He said Iraq's ``strategic aim is to free Palestine,'' echoing
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's effort to negotiate simultaneous
settlements for his occupation of Kuwait and the Palestinian
problem to project himself as the unrivaled leader of the Arab
world.
   Western officials have expressed fears that Iraq might be
plotting a campaign of sabotage. CIA Director William H. Webster
said Tuesday that Iraq's terrorist capabilities, chemical weapons
and missiles pose a serious international threat.
   What is difficult to determine, he said, is whether Saddam would
use these capabilities in the gulf standoff.
   Other Iraqi officials also have said their military would deploy
all weapons in case the forces in Saudi Arabia attacked Iraq to
reverse its Aug. 2 occupation of Kuwait.
   Iraq is known to possess chemical weapons, which it used in the
1980-88 war against Iran.
   In 1988, Saddam used chemical weapons against his own people
while crushing a rebellion by the ethinic Kurdish minority in
northern Iraq. Thousands of people were killed.

   Students hurled rocks and firebombs at
police today during demonstrations demanding the government
dissolve the National Assembly and resist U.S. pressure for greater
farm imports.
   The clashes between police and about 1,500 protesters at Seoul's
Konkook University were among several anti-government rallies
around the nation today. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   Protesters claim a merger of the governing party and two other
parties in the legislature is designed to perpetuate the rule of
President Roh Tae-woo. In August, all 78 opposition members of the
assembly resigned in protest.
   The rallies also urged South Korea to reject proposals to
liberalize imports of agricultural products. They claim the
proposals, backed by the United States, would bring in cheaper
foreign farm products and threaten South Korean farmers.
   At Konkook University, police fired tear gas from armored vans
to drive the students back inside buildings.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, 5,000 riot police sealed off a
plaza in front of the provincial government building to block a
rally, said the national news agency Yonhap. About 200 students
attacked a police substation in Kwangju with firebombs, but there
was no damage reported, Yonhap said.
   About 1,500 students clashed with police in a two-hour battle
outside Chonnam University in Kwangju, and another 1,000 students
confronted police outside Chosun University, the agency reported.
   Protests were also staged in the southern cities of Mokpo and
Sunchon, Yonhap said.

<TEXT>
   Noted sports columnist Peter Vecsey and 78 other
New York Post employees will leave the newspaper under a buyout
plan that was part of a $19 million union concession package
designed to keep the paper alive.
   The Newspaper Guild resignations, which were voluntary, mean the
Post will lose close to 200 of its 960 workers.
   Agreements reached last week called for 100 forced resignations
from the 263-member drivers union and five from the Post's 17 paper
handlers.
   All are to receive the same buyout package, which includes full
severance and an extra eight weeks pay they would have been
entitled to if the paper had closed.
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman said about half of the Guild
resignations were from the newsroom, which translates to about a
third of the news staff.
   ``It's not a number I like, or I'm happy with,'' he said.
   The newspaper had sought only 43 resignations from the Guild -
plus a 20 percent pay cut - to keep the paper running.
   But owner Peter Kalikow agreed in a last-minute compromise to
accept however many voluntary resignations were tendered. Anyone
choosing to resign by 5 p.m. Wednesday would get the same
termination and severance pay as if the paper had closed.
   The Guild resignations included people from editorial,
advertising, circulation, and accounting, although a breakdown by
department was not immediately available.
   The total cost of the 79 resignations to the Post was being
tabulated, Post spokesman Howard Rubinstein said.
   ``Some highly talented individuals have elected to depart,''
Post spokesman Howard Rubinstein said.
   But, he added, Kalikow ``is extremely confident that they will
continue to turn out an exciting newspaper that will have a major
impact on the city.''
   Thomas Pennacchio, Guild secretary-treasurer, said the newspaper
most likely would have to hire more people to replace any
overabundance of buyouts.
   ``The sense is that some people want to leave because they can't
afford the 20 percent cut,'' Pennachio said. ``Some are leaving
because they think the Post won't last long.''
   The Guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave Kalikow
more than $19 million in concessions he demanded from them to
eliminate his $27 million worth of annual red ink.
   Vecsey, whose gossipy, acerbic column was closely followed by
fans of professional basketball, will begin a sports column at USA
Today on Oct. 1.
   Post vice president Peter Faris said Vecsey's contract expires
in November and the Post did not match other offers he received.
   He said Vecsey's resignation was ``divorced from the buyout
scenario although as a Guild member he is availing himself of the
opportunity.''
   Vecsey also recently signed to be a reporter on NBC's NBA
pregame show, ``The Insiders.''

<HEAD>Soviet Spy Chief Willing To Give CIA Intelligence Data on Iraq</HEAD>

   The KGB would like to exchange information with
the CIA on Iraq but has not made the offer directly because past
proposals for cooperation have been rebuffed, the spy agency's
chief has told The Associated Press.
   ``I am convinced that we could really tell each other something
valuable, especially about ensuring the security of Soviet and
American citizens'' in the Persian Gulf region, KGB chairman
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov said in an interview.
   If the CIA wants help, ``You can be sure that our reaction would
be positive,'' Kryuchkov told the visiting AP board of directors
and executives on Wednesday.
   He said his agency is also willing to work with U.S.
intelligence in fighting international terrorism and narcotics
trafficking.
   The balding, white-haired Kryuchkov sat beneath a portrait of
Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin. Beside the KGB chief was a vase
of bright flowers that contrasted with the stark decor of the
wood-paneled conference room on the third floor of the Lubyanka,
the gray, pink and yellow KGB headquarters in downtown Moscow.
   On his left hung a portrait of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the
Soviet secret police.
   He joked with the group about the fear the KGB and the Lubyanka
inspired but said in serious tones that the agency was leaving
behind that ``tragic page'' of history.
   In meetings with American officials, Kryuchkov said, ``we always
give signals about being ready to work together in this or that
field'' with U.S. intelligence.
   ``The signals reach the right address,'' he said, but the answer
is always something along the lines of, ``We are not ready yet.''
   It was not clear precisely what sort of information the Soviets
might be willing to offer the United States. Most Iraqi military
equipment is Soviet-made, and providing intelligence on how to
defeat that equipment in battle might undermine the effectiveness
of the Soviet military in any possible confrontation with the
United States.
   Moreover, Kryuchkov acknowledged, the Kremlin is concerned about
possible Iraqi actions against Soviets who remain in that country.
   The Soviet Union still has about 5,000 specialists in Iraq,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said in a separate
briefing.
   ``We used to have about 8,000 experts,'' including non-military
specialists, he said.
   ``We said that we evacuated children and women ... which is not
exactly correct. We evacuated spouses and children. There are some
women experts still there. So far, 2,500 persons left Iraq, all the
children, all the spouses,'' he said.
   ``The Soviet community is slightly more than 5,000. About 60 of
them are women, these are experts of different Soviet
establishments there, say, typists,'' said Gerasimov.
   ``The experts whose contracts expire leave the country using
Aeroflot regular flights,'' he said, referring to the Soviet
government airline. ``Iraqi authorities did not make any
impediments to that.''
   Kryuchkov, in his interview with the AP, also denied that the
Soviet government had planted electronic eavesdropping devices in
the new U.S. Embassy office building in Moscow.
   U.S. officials have accused the KGB of lacing the brick
structure with sophisticated bugging devices. The Bush
administration is weighing plans to destroy the structure and build
another at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.
   Kryuchkov said he envisioned the day when the two superpowers
would no longer spy on each other.
   Already, he said, ``We do not consider the United States of
America our main enemy.''
   In the interview, Kryuchkov also said he did not want to see the
KGB divided into foreign and domestic intelligence-gathering
operations, along the lines of the FBI and CIA.
   He declined to disclose the KGB budget or the number of agents
it employs, citing similar secrecy on the part of U.S.
intelligence.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament is drafting a law that would
govern the actions of the KGB and give a legislative commission the
right to learn all the agency's secrets, similar to the Select
Intelligence Committees in the U.S. Congress, he said.
   Already, he said, the Ministry of Finance has a special
department that monitors the agency's expenditures.

<HEAD>Study: No Evidence Beta Carotene Prevents Skin Cancer</HEAD>

background of when Accutane report was widely publicized.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today said big doses of the nutrient
beta carotene fail to prevent skin cancer but that Mom's advice
still holds: Eat your vegetables.
   People who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables are less likely
to get cancer, and experts had suspected that their intake of beta
carotene might explain this.
   But a study published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine found that beta carotene does not seem to be the key
ingredient, at least as far as skin cancer is concerned.
   ``This conclusion should not, however, deter people from eating
fruits and vegetables,'' the researchers wrote.
   Beta carotene is the nutrient that makes carrots yellow and is
found in varying degrees in many fruits and vegetables. The body
uses it to manufacture vitamin A, which some believe can prevent
cancer, perhaps by trapping chemical compounds known as free
radicals that can harm the body's cells.
   The researchers tested beta carotene pills on people who had
been treated for basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer. None had
melanoma, the far more dangerous malignant form of skin cancer. The
treatment did nothing to slow the growth of new skin cancers.
   ``Although our results provide no support for an anti-cancer
effect of oral beta carotene on non-melanoma skin cancer, it would
be unwise to conclude on the basis of this study alone that beta
carotene is ineffective against all cancers,'' the researchers
wrote.
   They noted other evidence to suggest that it might prevent lung
cancer. Several other studies of beta carotene are also under way.
   The study was directed by Dr. E. Robert Greenberg of Dartmouth
Medical School.
   In the study, 1,805 people were randomly assigned to take 50
milligrams of beta carotene or placebos each day for a year. After
five years of follow-up, 362 people who took beta carotene and 340
in the comparison group had at least one new skin cancer.
   The researchers concluded that there is not enough evidence to
prescribe the nutrient as an anti-cancer treatment.
   A separate study in the journal, by Dr. Waun K. Hong of M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, showed that the acne drug
Accutane blocked the growth of new tumors in people being treated
for smoking-related cancer of the mouth and throat.
   The report was widely publicized in May when it was presented in
Washington at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology.
   Even after this cancer is initially removed, patients risk
getting new tumors elsewhere in their throats and lungs. Accutane,
an artificial form of vitamin A, reduced the recurrence rate from
24 percent in untreated patients to 4 percent in those getting the
medicine.

   The House-Senate conference committee working
on the 1990 farm bill set acreage reduction for wheat at 15 percent
this crop year as its first action toward melding the bills each
body approved this summer.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced today a 15
percent acreage set-aside for the 1991 wheat crop. Previously, he
had said it was his intention to require a reduction of 10 percent
to 20 percent.
   Yeutter said he was pleased that the conferees ``acted so
quickly on this important issue for winter wheat growers,'' who are
now planting their 1991 crop.
   The vote came Wednesday at the urging of the Agriculture
Department, which needs to advise farmers planting winter wheat on
the requirements they must follow to participate in the
government's subsidy programs.
   It followed an exchange of formalities between the chd food exports
apparently to ensure the country has adequate
supplies this winter.
   Leading members of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces
have said that the Socialists would not meet their demands for
participating in the Cabinet.
   The opposition seeks immediate privatization of land and
industry, and return of land to those who owned it before it was
collectivized under Communist rule. The Socialists agree to land
reform, but say land should be given to those who are tilling it
now.
   Lukanov's Cabinet contained only a handful of new faces, but
included the first new defense minister in 28 years. Lukanov
replaced Dobri Dzhurov with Yordan Mutafchiev.
   Dzhurov was a close associate of former Communist Party chief
Todor Zhivkov but was credited with helping party reformers remove
the hard-line leader in November.
   Science Minister Ilya Konev is the only Cabinet member not
associated with the Socialist Party. Two others, Labor and Social
Welfare Minister Emilia Maslarova, and Culture Minister Dimo Dimov,
are not formally members of the Socialist Party but were endorsed
by the Socialists when they ran for parliament.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is planning to visit U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf at Thanksgiving, about the same time
he intends to go to Europe and Latin America, a newspaper reported
today.
   Quoting unidentified administration officials, Newsday said
tentative plans called for Bush to make a morale-building
appearance among the troops of Operation Desert Shield in Saudi
Arabia and possibly stop in Egypt and Turkey to thank their leaders
for cooperating against Iraq.
   In Washington, White House officials said they could not confirm
the report and that no travel plans have been set.
   Thanksgiving was seen by White House advisers as a better time
than Christmas for Bush's visit because it is a secular American
holiday and less likely to upset Saudi Arabia's conservative Moslem
leadership, Newsday said.
   The visit would be part of a trip that tentatively would start
in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and include the Nov. 19 Paris summit of
the 34 nations in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
   The president then would visit Mexico Nov. 28-29 and make a
six-day trip in South America the first week of December, the
newspaper said.

Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   City officials say no evidence exists that a
large sign was to blame for the collapse of a downtown building's
wall that killed three people.
   City officials and police initially blamed a large metal sign on
the front of the Any Kind Check Cashing Agency for Tuesday's
collapse, which also injured eight people.
   But Cynthia Bayete, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Licenses and Inspections, told The Philadelphia Inquirer in today's
editions it appears now signs were not to blame.
   ``The feeling is that the signs did not have anything to do
with'' the collapse, Bayete said.
   The department's commissioner, Don Kligerman, said earlier that
the collapse apparently was triggered by the metal sign and steel
security gates, which he said were improperly fastened to the wall.
He said the two-story building's owners were cited in June for a
zoning violation.
   But department officials said later that the violation involved
a city Art Commission complaint over the sign's lettering.

   Japan has proposed sending a 1,000-member group
that includes defense forces and retired military personnel to the
Persian Gulf, a newspaper reported today.
   Only about 100 of the proposed ``U.N. peace cooperation corps''
would be members of the Self Defense Forces, Japan's military, the
newspaper Asahi Shimbun said, citing unidentified government
sources.
   Other members of the proposed group - similar to a reserve unit
- would be retired military personnel and volunteers from local
police and fire departments, it said. The team would limit itself
to technical assistance such as medical service, surveillance,
communications, transport and construction, news reports said.
   The force would allow Japan to contribute to the buildup in the
Persian Gulf despite the nation's ban on sending troops overseas.
   Japan, as the world's second-largest economy, has felt
increasing pressure from the United States to move beyond its
promise of $4 billion in gulf aid to a more active role.
   Some leading members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
want to break free of the constitutional ban on using military
force to settle international conflicts.
   The party, however, has been weakened by a series of election
setbacks. It is afraid of igniting a fierce battle in Parliament
with the leading opposition Socialist Party, which strongly opposes
any change in the constitution or in the Self Defense Forces Law.
   ``We will hve to be very careful how to handle this matter,''
chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said today. ``We have to
make sure to build consensus within the party first.''
   In Japan, any prospect of renewed militarism usually arouses
fear and bitterness.
   It is an issue politicians like to avoid, and the current U.N.
peace cooperation bill is being laboriously designed to skirt such
constitutional questions.
   The planned corps would report directly to the prime minister.
Self Defense Forces personnel serving in the unit probably would
assume a special status as civilian government employees.
   In any case, events in the gulf may bypass the government's
political maneuvering. Officials say it's likely to be at least 1{
months before the peace cooperation corps could be formed, even if
the bill sails smoothly through Parliament.

   Tamil gunmen stormed a fishing village
on the west coast, killing at least 40 Sinhalese people with
machetes and automatic rifles, military officials said today.
   Wednesday's attack in the Vellamundel village, 110 miles north
of Colombo, is the latest in a series of killings of civilians by
the Tamil rebels, the Sinhalese-dominated army and Moslem militant
groups.
   The military officials said about 30 Tamil guerrillas raided the
village from jungle hideouts in the interior. After the attack,
they split into two groups, one heading for the coast and the other
toward the jungle, they said.
   At least 30 huts in the village were set ablaze, the officials
said.
   Word of the attack reached the army when five Sinhalese men,
with gunshot and stab wounds, made it to a military camp, the
officials said.
   Defense Secretary, Gen. Cyril Ranatunga later ordered deployment
of troops into the area and increased the number of government
militiamen.
   The government also decided to issue firearms and hand grenades
to the villagers to protect themselves against ``such barbaric
onslaughts,'' a government statement said.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1983. Their war against the Sinhalese-dominated government
and military resumed in June this year after a 13-month cease-fire.
   At least 3,000 combatants have been killed in the fighting since
June. Many civilians have died, but there are no estimates of the
number of deaths.
   Civilian deaths have been reported in government attacks on
rebel-held territory and in raids by the Tamils on villages.
   The rebels have targetted members of the Sinhalese community and
Moslems, whom they accuse of supporting the army. Armed Moslems
have been accused of revenge attacks on Tamil civilians.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 millin people and
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent. Moslems make up about 7 percent.

   A man who lost an arm after falling on the
subway tracks while drunk has been awarded $9.3 million by a jury.
   ``God bless America,'' said Francisco Marino, a Mexican citizen
who had been in the United States for one year working as a
dishwasher before the April 1989 accident.
   City transit officials said they would appeal Wednesday's state
Supreme Court decision, which compensates Marino, 30, for pain and
suffering and loss of earnings. He was hit by a northbound train
after falling.
   ``We're outraged and we are confident that this will be
overturned on appeal,'' said a Transit Authority spokesman Termaine
Garden.
   His lawyer, Alan Shapey, contended Marino would not have fallen
in front of the train if transit officials had followed their
guidelines to ``take charge'' of disabled or intoxicated people, at
least until a police officer arrives, to ensure their safety.
   Shapey argued that, although a transit clerk reported Marino's
presence on the platform, the man was not removed.

   Iraq Thursday asked U.S. networks to broadcast a videotaped
message by Saddam Hussein to the American people. Iraq's
information minister Latif Nassayef Jassim was quoted by the Iraqi
News Agency as requesting the U.S. TV time. He did not disclose
what Saddam's message says, but it is likely a rebuttal to
President Bush's speech to the Iraqi people televised Sunday.
   ---
   Organizers of the Asian Games Thursday banned Iraq from the
competition, which begins Saturday in Beijing.
   Delegates leaving a closed meeting of the 38-member council in
Beijing said that of those present, 27 voted today to expel Iraq,
three opposed expulsion, five abstained and one ballot was invalid.
Approval of two-thirds of voting delegates was needed to pass the
ban. Abstentions did not count.
   ---
   An American soldier was killed and two others injured Thursday
in a jeep accident in the Saudi Arabian desert, U.S. military
officials said.
   The death brought to four the number of fatalities among
American personnel since Operation Desert Shield began in early
August. All were accidental.
   ---
   Iraq's information minister was quoted as saying Thursday that
Iraq will knock out Persian Gulf oil fields if attacked by
multinational forces assembled in Saudi Arabia.
   ---
   French soldiers, including Foreign Legionnaires, gathered in the
French port of Toulon Thursday to begin a four-day sealift for
Saudi Arabia. About 4,000 ground troops will take part in France's
largest sealift in at least 30 years.
   ---
   A charter flight carrying American women and children from
Kuwait was heading to North Carolina Thursday after a stopover in
London. The last flight is scheduled to depart on Saturday, the
State Department said, leaving behind hundreds of mostly male
American hostages.
   ---
   Lebanon's civil war-wracked economy got some help from Saudi
Arabia. The Lebanese government said Thursday it has received $100
million from the Saudis to help offset the loss of funding promised
by Kuwait and oil-rich Arab governments now faced with the gulf
crisis.
   ---
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members - the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China - had agreed to extend the trade embargo
against Iraq to air traffic.
   The resolution is expected to be put to a vote in the 15-member
council on Friday or Saturday, diplomats said.

   The Olympic Council of Asia voted today to expel
Iraq from the Asian Games and from the council as punishment for
its invasion of Kuwait, delegates said.
   Delegates leaving a closed meeting of the 38-member council said
that of those present, 27 voted to expel Iraq, three opposed
expulsion, five abstained and one of the ballots was invalid.
   Iraq, Yemen and the Palestine representatives opposed expulsion,
said Roy De Silva of Sri Lanka, vice chairman of the meeting.
Mongolia and Afghanistan did not vote, but the reason was not
immediately known.
   Palestine is recognized as an associate member by the Olympic
Council of Asia and allowed to enter the Games and vote in council
meetings. Palestine is not recognized by the International Olympic
Committee.
   The council's president, Sheik Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of
Kuwait, was killed when Iraqi troops stormed the royal palace
following the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``We the Kuwaitis have justice on our side,'' said his son,
Ahmed Fahd Al-Sabah, president of Kuwait's National Olympic
Committee.
   The voting took less than 30 minutes, and it was not immediately
clear why the one ballot was invalidated. Approval of two-thirds of
voting delegates was needed to pass theban. Abstentions did not
count.
   Delegates said Iraq was suspended from the council until
Kuwait's National Olympic Committee is able to function normally in
its homeland. Most of Kuwait's competitors were trapped in the
country following the Iraqi invasion.
   Some Kuwaiti athletes, who were outside their nation when Iraq
invaded, have arrived in Beijing to compete.
   The Games open Saturday and close Oct. 7. At least 31 nations
representing about 4,300 athletes have agreed to participate in the
games, held every four years. Iraq had declared its intention to
compete, but its athletes had not yet checked in at the Games
village.
   ``We feel sorry for the (Iraqi) athletes. We feel more sorry for
the spirit of Olympism. This is a victory for everything illegal,''
said Abdul Karim Al-Mulla, president of Iraq's National Olympic
Committee. ``It is clear that there was great pressure.''
   An Iraqi National Olympic Committee statement described the
expulsion as ``a clear and flagrant violation of the OCA
constitution and all its principles and values of fair treatment
for all members.''
   Today's council meeting began with all delegates, including the
Iraqis, standing in a moment of silence for the slain council
president, delegates said.
   Ahmed Fahd Al-Sabah said he was ``very overwhelmed'' by the
prayer for his father.
   He said the vote would help the morale of the few Kuwaiti
athletes at the Games.
   ``But, unfortunately, most of our athletes cannot participate,''
he said. ``In any case, they feel now that the whole world and Asia
are with them.''
   The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Kuwait,
initially threatened to boycott the 16-day event if Iraq was
allowed to compete.
   But Kuwait later backed down from the boycott threat, saying it
would resort to that only if the council meeting were ``unfair.''
   China, eager for the first full-attendance Asiad ever, had been
seeking to reconcile the two sides, while many smaller Asian
countries have shown reluctance to enter into the fray.
   In a meeting Saturday in Beijing, the council's 11-member
executive bureau recommended Iraq be barred from both the games and
membership in the council, but left the final decision to the
general assembly.

<HEAD>Church Orders Theater Company to Stop Performing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An avant-garde theater company was ordered to
quit performing its play called ``The Cardinal Detoxes'' or face
eviction by the landlord: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New
York.
   The RAPP Theater Co., part of the RAPP Arts Center, agreed in
its lease with the church not to present such works in the
building, a former parochial school.
   But R. Jeffrey Cohen, RAPP's founder and artistic director,
called the archdiocese's threat an attempt at censorship and
promised to fight it in court.
   ``We will not buckle under the pressure,'' Cohen said. ``My
attorneys have been looking into it and they are convinced that the
church's position is unconstitutional as well as being
unconscionable.''
   The play by Thomas M. Disch, drama critic of The Nation, is a
35-minute monologue about an archbishop who has been placed in a
church-run detoxification center because he has killed a pregnant
woman in an auto accident while driving drunk.
   The archbishop delivers a diatribe against church policies on
abortion, women's rights, homosexuality and other issues.
   Cohen said the center received a letter Monday from the
archdiocese demanding the theater company ``immediately terminate
the performance'' of the play because it violates the center's
lease.
   An archdiocese spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, said the letter did
not amount to censorship.
   The center's lease states that it acknowledges the church owns
the land and that any activity offensive to the church's principles
``would be detrimental to the landlord's reputation,'' he said.
   ``This was agreed to by the tenant after extensive
discussions,'' Zwilling said. ``We went over this very carefully.
They said they would abide by these principles.''
   The RAPP Arts Center is an experimental group that presents
avant-garde theater, music, dance and film. Among those it has
presented is performance artist Karen Finley, who recently lost a
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts after officials said
her work would not ``enhance public understanding and appreciation
of the arts.''
   Cohen said he had not decided if he would defy the church's
order and present the play this Friday and Saturday nights.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's Saddam Hussein has recorded a
message to the American people, and his government has asked that
it be broadcast by television networks in the United States, the
Iraqi News Agency reported today.
   Also today, a Turkish newspaper quoted Saddam as saying Iraq
could fight for five or six years if war breaks out and ``can hurt
America.''
   Speaking of the international trade embargo against Iraq, the
newspaper Milliyet of Istanbul quoted Saddam as saying in an
interview: ``We are preparing ourselves for a blockade that could
last for years ... We have fought for eight years (against Iran).
If necessary we can fight for another three to four years, another
five to six years.''
   Saddam was also quoted as saying Iraq ``knows that America is
the No. 1 superpower in the world. But we also are confident that
we can hurt America.''
   Iraq's news agency did not provide any detail of the content of
the Saddam's television message for the United States, which is
clearly a response to one by President Bush that was broadcast by
Iraqi television on Sunday.
   It quoted Information Minister Latif Nassyif Jassim as saying
``concerned American personalities have been contacted and asked to
take delivery of the tape for broadcasting on American television
channels.''
   Jassim said the Iraqi government still has not received a
response to the request ``made on the basis of reciprocal
treatment.''
   But if the United States blocks the attempt, Jassim said, ``The
concerned Iraqi authorities will find alternative ways to transmit
the message to the American people through international television
stations.''
   In his statement, he did not say when the message was taped or
give its length.
   Bush's address to the Iraqis was eight minutes long. It was
taped at the White House and delivered with Arabic subtitles and an
Arabic-language voiceover. The full text was broadcast on the Iraqi
television.
   U.S. officials have complained about the broadcast time given to
Saddam's messages and staged appearances with Western hostages -
particularly by the all-news American network CNN. Diplomats say
they have helped garner support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf
standoff, especially among radical Arab masses.
   Responding to the complaint, Jassim offered Bush time on the
Iraqi television.
   In Bush's weekend broadcast, he said: ``Iraq stands isolated and
alone'' now that the U.N. Security Council has slapped sanctions on
it as punishment for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Saddam Hussein tells you that the crisis is a struggle between
Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world,'' he said.
   The speech sparked widespread anger among Iraqis, who poured
into the streets of Baghdad to shout: ``Death to Bush, Death to
America!''
   Veteran Iraqi announcer Mikdad Morad, who reads many of Saddam's
mesages, called Bush's message ``full of lies and contradictions.''

   An American soldier was killed and
two others injured today in a jeep accident in the Saudi Arabian
desert, U.S. military officials said.
   The death brought to 17 the number of fatalities among American
personnel since Operation Desert Shield began in early August. All
were accidental.
   Military spokesmen said the latest accident involved a vehicle
belonging to the 82nd Airbone Division operating ``off road'' in an
undisclosed location.
   They said the three soldiers were carried by helicopter to Fleet
Marine Hospital No. 5 in Saudi Arabia, where one was declared dead
on arrival with head injuries. One was undergoing treatment for a
dislocated knee and the third was treated and released.
   Their identities were withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   It was the second accident in two days involving the 82nd
Airborne. A soldier was slightly wounded by shrapnel on Wednesday
when an artillery round exploded 200 yards from his position during
drills.
   Previous fatalities among U.S. servicemen in the Middle East
included a soldier hit by a truck, another killed in a road
collision and a sailor electrocuted in a mishap aboard the
destroyer USS Antietam in the Persian Gulf.
   The worst accident involving U.S. servicemen involved in the
Persian Gulf standoff occurred on Aug. 29 when a giant C-5A
transport aircraft loaded with supplies for U.S. forces in the gulf
crashed and burned shortly after takeoff in West Germany, killing
13 crew members.

   NATO's top official today criticized
the Western allies for not sending more ground forces and other
assistance to the Persian Gulf region to support the huge American
military buildup.
   ``Let me clearly state my personal opinion - that some allies
could and should do more,'' said Manfred Woerner, secretary-general
of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``It would be helpful if, in addition to Great Britain and
France, also other allies could send ground troops to the gulf as
suggested by the United States,'' he said at a security conference
sponsored by the U.S. Mission to NATO.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III last week asked the
alliance nations to deploy additional ground-based forces in the
region - ``even if it were only symbolic.''
   Since then, Britain and France have announced they will send
thousands of ground troops to the region, but no other NATO nations
have joined in.
   Woerner said the gulf crisis has raised the question of whether
NATO should play a greater role in dealing with so-called regional
or out-of-area conflicts, which affect the security of member
nations.
   Under NATO's treaty, member nations have agreed to consider an
armed attack on any one of them, in Europe or North America, as an
attack against all of them. It allows consultations for events
occurring outside the area.
   ``Who could deny that the maintenance of an uninterrupted supply
of oil is a vital issue for the security of all the members of the
alliance,'' he said.

   Synagogues and a Jewish youth group in this
college town known for its liberal politics have been assigned
police protection during Rosh Hashana because of an outbreak of
anti-Semitic vandalism and harassment.
   ``Madison has changed; it was so tolerant,'' Jeanne Bleicher
said Wednesday night as she left a service for the Jewish New Year,
which began at sundown.
   Police have handled 23 anti-Semitic reports over two months in
this home of state government and the University of Wisconsin's
main campus.
   Madison police said no anti-Semitic crimes occurred Wednesday
night or during this morning's services.
   ``Things went just fine. Maybe it's all over,'' said Steven
Morrison, director of the Madison Jewish Community Council, adding
that the last ``hate crime'' was committed about 10 days ago.
   Graffiti has appeared on synagogues and the houses of
predominantly Jewish fraternities and sororities. Windows have been
broken and insults yelled at people on the streets. In July,
someone cut the brake lines on a school bus for a Jewish camp. The
vandalism was discovered before the bus was used.
   Police have no suspects, which left the Jewish community jittery
as their faith's most solemn holidays approached.
   Jewish leaders asked police to provide at least one officer for
services at the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, an organization for
Jewish young people, Temple Beth Israel and Temple Beth El, said
Morrison.
   ``It's sad and outrageous that at this time, in this country and
this city, coming down on the side of caution requires having
police present,'' Morrison said.
   ``It was a comfort,'' Irv Saposnik, director of an organization
for Jewish students at the university, said of police officers on
hand for services. ``Things went wonderfully. The whole city has
responded right on target.''
   Felicia Roberts, who also attended services, said the Jewish
community is just one of many groups targeted for hate crimes.
   ``There's a small group of people around that aren't tolerant.
They never will be,'' she said. ``I don't feel singled out more
than any other group.''
   The police presence moved Stanleigh Friedman, 76, who attended
services at Temple Beth El.
   ``Hitler's been gone for 45 years, but it seems like he's being
awakened,'' he said.
   Madison has a population of about 170,000. The Jewish population
is less than 5 percent. More than 43,000 students are enrolled at
the university's Madison campus. Madison was a hotbed of radical
anti-Vietnam War sentiment during the 1960s and '70s and is known
for its tolerance of ethnic and cultural diversity.
   Rosh Hashanah, which often is celebrated two days, marks the
start of the Jewish faith's 10-day High Holidays that end with Yom
Kippur, the day of atonement, on Sept. 29.
   University student Natalie Antinoff said the anti-Semitic acts
motivated her to go to services.
   ``This is the first time I've come to temple other than for
family events in years,'' she said. ``The threats made me want to
stand up for my religion by not hiding, by not being afraid but
taking a stand and being out in public.''

<TEXT>
   Parliament today confirmed Premier Andrei
Lukanov, allowing him to continue leading the government despite
his failure to form a coalition with opposition parties.
   The vote followed Lukanov's address on national TV on Wednesday
night, when he promised to seek quick passage of new laws to
encourage private farming and end decades of state control of the
economy.
   Lukanov appealed for unspecified ``practical measures'' to end
state control of most sectors of the economy and replace it with
private ownership. He also said tax and banking reforms were needed
to stimulate the private sector.
   He specifically mentioned the need for a land act to boost the
development of private farming.
   Opposition parties are seeking immediate privatization of land
and industry, and return of land to those who owned it before it
was collectivized under Communist rule. The Socialists, who are
former Communists, agree to land reform, but say land should be
given to those who are tilling it now.
   Earlier in the day, the Socialist-dominated Grand National
Assembly confirmed Lukanov by a vote of 234-104 with 28
abstentions. Thirty-four deputies were absent.
   The rest of the Cabinet ministers must be approved by parliament
later. It will be Lukanov's second government in seven months.
   Lukanov repeatedly has urged the opposition to join in a
coalition government to forge a program with wide backing in
society. But he was forced late Wednesday to propose a new Cabinet
dominated by his party, the Socialists, because of continuing
opposition reluctance to participate.
   Leading members of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces
have said that the Socialists would not meet their demands for
participating in the Cabinet.
   The Socialists are heirs to the long-ruling Communists, who
chose the name change last spring along with departure from an
authoritarian past and won a parliamentary majority in June's
watershed free elections.
   The Socialists have since seen their popularity wane, however,
because of Bulgaria's faltering economy.
   Some basic foodstuffs and consumer goods are in short supply or
unavailable, and the government began rationing of sugar, cooking
oil and other goods during the summer.
   Electricity is being rationed, and the government this week
banned food exports apparently to ensure the country has adequate
supplies this winter.
   Lukanov's Cabinet contained only a handful of new faces, but
included the first new defense minister in 28 years. Lukanov
replaced Dobri Dzhurov with Yordan Mutafchiev.
   Dzhurov was a close associate of former Communist Party chief
Todor Zhivkov but was credited with helping party reformers remove
the hard-line leader in November.
   Science Minister Ilya Konev is the only Cabinet member not
associated with the Socialist Party. Two others, Labor and Social
Welfare Minister Emilia Maslarova, and Culture Minister Dimo Dimov,
are not formally members of the Socialist Party but were endorsed
by the Socialists when they ran for parliament.

   A senior adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said today the Soviet Union is eager to see the United States and
Cuba normalize their relations and is prepared to help in the
process.
   Speaking to members of The Associated Press board of directors
and Associated Press executives, Presidential Council member
Yevgeny Primakov also said the Soviet Union will not base future
aid to Cuba solely on the political consideration of keeping
President Fidel Castro in power.
   Questions about Cuba figured prominently in the wide-ranging
discusion with Primakov, who also said the Soviet Union has
``stopped thinking of exporting revolution in any form.'' Asked if
Cuba has made a similar decision, Primakov said: ``They are now
reconsidering a lot of their policies.''
   He added that others, presumably meaning the United States,
``should absolutely forget about exporting counterrevolution.''
   Primakov said the Soviet Union wants Cuba to be ``a factor of
stability'' in international politics and said his country would
like to see the normalization of Cuban-American relations. ``We are
prepared to help bring this about,'' he said.
   Asked if the decline of Soviet aid to Cuba could cause the fall
of Castro, Primakov said: ``I don't think the Castro government is
that unstable.''
   He said Cuba does not depend exclusively on aid from the Soviet
Union and that trade between the two countries is mutually
beneficial.
   ``I don't think Castro is competely dependent'' on the Soviet
Union, Primakov said, adding that the Soviet Union ``won't be
completely guided by the political considerations of keeping Castro
in power'' as it reviews its aid and trade policies with Cuba.

   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said
today a deficit-reduction plan should include a cut in taxes on
capital gains. He later explained he was not advocating a
reduction, but spelling out conditions under which one might be
approved.
   President Bush's repeated call for a capital-gains cut has been
a major obstacle to agreement between the White House and
congressional leaders on a deficit-reduction plan. Mitchell's
all-out opposition prevented approval of the capital-gains
provision last year.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, was being interviewed today on the C-SPAN
network when a telephone caller asked why, since he favored a
capital-gains cut in 1986, he now is so opposed.
   ``I do believe that we should enact it as part of this
(deficit-reduction) package now, but in a manner that makes it part
of a fair and progressive tax structure and which does not increase
the budget deficit,'' Mitchell responded.
   Meeting with reporters later, Mitchell denied that he now is
advocating a capital-gains cut.
   He said any reduction must meet the three tests: ``It must be
part of a fair and progressive system, it should not bust the
deficit and it should be targeted to investment and small
business.''
   Bush and other advocates of a cut in taxes on capital gains,
which are profits from the sale of investments, say it is needed to
promote investment and create jobs.
   In the C-SPAN interview, Mitchell noted that almost 80 percent
of the direct benefits of such a cut would go to people with
incomes above $100,000 a year. He said Democrats are telling Bush
that if he is to win a capital-gains reduction, it must be offset
by raising taxes in other ways on the well-to-do.
   ``What we have suggested is that we accept a capital-gains
differential but it be offset in some way so we don't have a
situation where we ask all Americans to sacrifice to deal with the
budget deficit except those with incomes of $200,000 a year or
more,'' Mitchell said.
   Unless the wealthy are required to pay for a capital-gains cut,
he said, the deficit would be worsened. ``Should we as the first
and most important step in trying to reduce the deficit adopt a
measure that will increase the deficit?'' he asked.
   Republicans have proposed that the capital-gains cut be offset
by limiting the itemized deductions of higher-income Americans.
Democrats have rejected that approach.

<HEAD>Man Who Was Declared Dead Is Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was declared dead and whose
estate has been distributed is alive.
   A notation in the Montgomery County Circuit Court file reads,
``After sworn testimony, Judge (William C.) Miller formally noted
that Dennis Rarick is not deceased.''
   Rarick, now 49 and living in San Marcos, Calif., said he was
deeply depressed when he disappeared in 1976 for ``personal
reasons.''
   `I left the Montgomery County area and assumed a new identity
because I was emotionally unable to cope with certain circumstances
of my personal life at that time,'' he said.
   ``I had a choice of commiting suicide or going away and getting
myself together,'' Rarick told The Washington Times in a telephone
interview.
   He moved to British Columbia, assumed the name of Leonard Allen
Cohn, and then came back to the United States. He received a
doctorate in computer science from Columbia University, got married
and eventually settled in California.
   ``Instead of saying I found happiness, it's better to say I
found less stress,'' Rarick told the newspaper.
   Last December, Cohn told his wife he was really Rarick. The
revelation led to counseling, but Rarick said, their relationship
is stronger than ever.
   Meanwhile, his estate grew. In 1986, Rarick's father, a retired
mechanical engineer in Indiana, began distribution of his son's
estate, which had grown to about $81,000.
   Rarick told Miller on Sept. 12 he made no claim on the estate.
   `If I wanted that, I shouldn't have disappeared in the first
place,'' he told the Times Wednesday.
   He did, however, receive a refund of about $7,700 from the
Internal Revenue Service in inheritance taxes.
   ``Nobody suffered material loss,'' Rarick said. ``A lot of
people suffered emotional harm, my own family particularly.''
   He has taken steps to change his name back. His two teen-aged
sons have already changed their names to Rarick.
   Rarick talked to his father in December and learned that his
mother died four years ago. He said his family has been `very
accepting and open and loving. My friends are having a much more
difficult time coping.''

<HEAD>Courthouse Bombing May Be Work Of White Supremacist Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white supremacist organization asked that
hate-crime laws be repealed and hinted that its members were
responsible for a bombing which damaged the federal courthouse.
   In a letter received Tuesday by KNSD-TV, a group called The Holy
Church of the White Fighting Machine of the Cross said it is
seeking the nullification of ``all anti-white laws pertaining to
hate crimes.'' It also asks ``that new trials be given to
incarcerees due to hate crimes.''
   The previously unknown group did not specifically claim
responsibility for last weekend's bombing, which blew out two glass
courthouse doors. Its letter said that, while no one was hurt, the
group ``cannot guarantee there will not be injuries in the
future.''
   Station officials turned the letter over to the FBI, which is
investigating the bombing.
   ``Obviously the existence of a letter does not prove anybody did
the bombing,'' said FBI agent Gene Riehl. ``It's just part of the
investigation process.''
   In the latest instance of apparent hate crimes in the San
Francisco Bay area, students and staff at two schools in Haywood
said they were angered by bigoted symbols and slogans that were
painted on the schools.
   ``We're outraged. It's something we won't tolerate in Hayward or
our high school,'' said Larry Ratto, principal at Hayward High
School, which was painted with swastikas and racial epithets
Tuesday.
   Similar derogatory slogans and the letters KKK were painted on
the King Intermediate School on Sunday. Police had no suspects.
   In San Diego, authorities said four men described as
``military-looking'' were seen running from the area of the
downtown San Diego courthouse shortly before a homemade bomb
detnated about 12:45 a.m. Saturday.
   The one-page, typewritten letter also says the U.S.-Mexico
border should be closed by the National Guard to prevent illegal
immigration.
   ``A time frame of 30 days will be granted by WHITE POWER to
effect this, before further action,'' the letter said.
   Roberto Martinez, a high-profile immigrant rights activist in
San Diego, also received a hate letter recently from The Holy
Church of the White Fighting Machine of the Cross.
   Martinez also is director of the U.S.-Mexico Border Program in
the San Diego area for the American Friends Service Committee. The
73-year-old Quaker organization carries out programs for peace and
justice in 30 countries.
   The letter to Martinez is filled with expletives and racial
slurs, and warns him to ``stop criticizing the Border Patrol.''
   That letter was one of several that Martinez said he has
received, along with threatening phone calls from more than one
white supremacist group.
   The letter to Martinez is being investigated as a hate crime,
police said.

<HEAD>School District Told Cars a Key Ingredient in Teaching Students to
Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key to a successful driver
education course is the key to a car, say parents and students who
have started a drive to have local schools keep using automobiles
as teaching tools.
   A $246.7 million budget adopted Tuesday by the Leon County
School Board includes only $10,000 for driver education. School
officials say $50,000 is needed to buy the 14 cars the program
would need.
   One parent, Marie Kokol, is trying to get auto dealers to donate
cars.
   Student Kevin Kahn has already donated his family's 1976
Plymouth Valiant to the cause.
   ``It doesn't look too good, but it runs good and has a new
battery,'' the 14-year-old said as he handed the keys to school
officials at Tuesday's board meeting. The crowd of about 75 people
applauded.
   With money short, Leon County could be forced to teach its
students to drive in the classroom instead of the car.
   That's already the case in two other Florida districts, in Palm
Beach and Lake counties.
   In Palm Beach, classroom instruction is augmented by simulator
training, similar to the kind the Army uses to teach soldiers to
drive tanks, said Manny Harageones, a driver's education consultant
with the state Education Department.
   ``It's a proven way to teach,'' Harageones said.
   But John Walker, who supervises driver training for the
district, said he hopes to get students back into cars as soon as
possible.
   Lake County Superintendent Beverly Haskins says she's just as
happy without the hassle of cars and few parents have complained.
   Students and parents at Tuesday's meeting in Leon County were
complaining.
   ``Until we get behind the wheel, there's nothing really that he
can teach us,'' 15-year-old Jeannie Walker said of her driver
education teacher at Lincoln High School.

<HEAD>Soweto Mass Funeral Draws Thousands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said today the
African National Congress would resist demands to give its
supporters guns even though it understood their desire to defend
themselves.
   Speaking to a mass funeral for 12 people killed in black
factional fighting, Mandela called the desire for weapons
``reasonable.'' He said it would be difficult to resist the demand,
but the ANC would not hand out guns to untrained people.
   ANC supporters have been demanding weapons because of the savage
street fighting in black townships around Johannesburg that has
claimed some 800 lives in the past month.
   The more than 20,000 people at Jabulani Stadium in Soweto
cheered when Mandela, the ANC deputy president, made a surprise
appearance.
   He and other top ANC officials had been meeting since Tuesday to
discuss the violence and government responses to end it.
   Mandela criticized recent government security measures to stop
the unrest, saying they were intended to arm the white government
and disarm ``liberation movements.''
   His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived earlier and stood with the ANC
leaders on the stage. The crowd sang revolutionary songs and
chanted anti-apartheid slogans.
   Police said today that 478 bodies from the weeks of fighting
remained unclaimed in state mortuaries and would be disposed of
soon in pauper funerals.
   The Soweto police spokesman, Capt. Mikhachane Ngobeni, told the
independent South African Press Association that one mortuary
contained 270 unclaimed bodies, most of them unidentified.
   The violence has eased in recent days.
   Police strung razor wire around the Merafe hostel in Soweto as
part of measures to try to halt the fighting. Several dozen armed
policemen patrolled outside the hostel.
   President F.W. de Klerk met Wednesday with his Cabinet and later
announced new steps designed to curb the unrest, including special
investigative teams to probe specific incidents. He also announced
an amnesty for any group or individual surrendering illegal
firearms and explosives by Oct. 1.
   De Klerk's steps followed last week's announcement of new police
measures, including roadblocks, weapons searches, isolating flash
points such as workers' hostels and squatter camps, and sending in
more police and soldiers.
   Mandela has predicted the police measures would be ineffective.
He also has said the ANC could suspend peace talks with the
white-led government if security forces fail to halt the bloodshed.
   The fighting has pitted Xhosas and other blacks linked to the
ANC against Zulu supporters of the conservative Inkatha movement.
It spread from the eastern Natal Province, the traditional Zulu
homeland, where five years of clashes have killed more than 5,000
people.
   SAPA reported that several ANC and Inkatha officials met
Wednesday night in Durban, in Natal, to discuss the violence. It
was the first meeting between top officials of the two groups since
1979.

   The bulk of Iraqi forces in Kuwait
appear to be poor, confused teen-agers, but crack Republican Guards
are tightening their control over the city, Kuwaitis fleeing their
country say.
   Refugees interviewed over the past few days at this border
crossing said Iraqi troops were becoming increasingly violent in
their campaign to force Kuwaitis to accept Iraqi occupation.
   Checkpoints every 900 feet are now controlled by at least one
Republican Guard, who makes sure that searches are thorough.
   Neighborhood searches have also become more intense, with whole
areas completely cut off with six or eight roadblocks as up to 20
soldiers comb each house, said the refugees, who generally spoke on
condition of anonymity to protect family members left behind from
possible retribution.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - George Washington was barely into his second
year as president when the government slapped a tax on whiskey.
Cigarettes were targeted during the Civil War. Furs and other
luxuries were taxed to help finance World War I.
   Now Congress and the Bush administration are eyeing those
products and others in the search for revenues with which to fight
a new war - the long-running battle against the budget deficit.
   Despite lingering disagreement over several deficit-reduction
proposals, chiefly President Bush's plan to cut taxes on capital
gains, negotiators for Congress and the White House have agreed
tentatively on a half-dozen tax increases that would affect million
of Americans.
   The federal government faces $100 billion worth of arbitrary
cuts in most programs Oct. 1 - barely a month before elections -
unless a deficit reduction plan can be enacted.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Pierre Rinfret, the Republicans'
last-minute, bottom-of-the-barrel choice to run against Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo, is out of money, out a campaign manager and
practically out of the race.
   John Denny, Rinfret's deputy campaign manager, said Wednesday
there was ``a strong possibility'' Rinfret will stop actively
campaigning because of money woes.
   The millionaire economist, who in recent months had been derided
by prominent members of his own party as a ``buffoon'' and
``brainless wonder,'' accused state GOP leaders of failing to back
him financially.
   ``Our financial situation is so desperate that I'm probably
going to have to shut down our entire operation this Friday,''
Rinfret, 66, wrote to GOP leaders Tuesday. ``I thought you should
know that all of our money is gone.''
   Rinfret's dark-horse challenge to Cuomo's bid for a third,
four-year term marks the first run for public office for the former
unpaid adviser to President Nixon.

   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Illinois is witnessing a political role
reversal this fall in the campaign for governor: a Democrat running
as a tax-cutting, budget-slashing fiscal conservative, and a
Republican under attack as a tax-and-spend liberal.
   Republican Jim Edgar has found himself on the defensive against
Democrat Neil Hartigan's anti-tax rhetoric, and recent polls have
indicated the race is virtually a dead heat.
   ``Edgar has got to find a way to deal with the tax issue,'' says
political scientist Paul Green of Governors State University. ``It
could sink him. It's more than a one-shot issue, it's the dominant
issue.''
   Edgar is a former state lawmaker and aide to four-term Gov.
James R. Thompson. The 52-year-old Hartigan was launched into
statewide politics in the early 1970s by the late Chicago Mayor
Richard J. Daley.

   MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Synagogues and a Jewish youth group in this
college town known for its liberal politics have been assigned
police protection during Rosh Hashana because of an outbreak of
anti-Semitic vandalism and harassment.
   ``Madison has changed; it was so tolerant,'' Jeanne Bleicher
said Wednesday night as she left a service for the Jewish New Year,
which began at sundown.
   Police have handled 23 anti-Semitic reports over two months in
this home of state government and the University of Wisconsin's
main campus.
   Graffiti has appeared on synagogues and the houses of
predominantly Jewish fraternities and sororities. Windows have been
broken and insults yelled at people on the streets. In July,
someone cut the brake lines on a school bus for a Jewish camp. The
vandalism was discovered before the bus was used.

<TEXT>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme, the latest of the
hard-bodies to join the action movie market, likes to say that he
came to Hollywood with my legs, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger came
with his muscles.
   Van Damme claims that the comparison to top pectoral-man
Schwarzenegger is minimal: ``All the newspapers compare me to
Arnold. But we are very different. I came from Belgium, he came
from Austria. They have tendency in the business always to compare
people.''
   Not without reason. Both men have a fanatical devotion to their
bodies. Both are as shrewd as Wall Street lawyers about their
careers. And both have a charming faculty for mangling the English
language.
   But unlike Schwarzenegger, Van Damme would like future films to
take a romantic turn.
   ``I get lots of fan mails from ladies,'' the Belgian said.
``They say, `We love your movies and love the action, but we would
like to see you in the romantic type of film, with some feeling and
some passion.'
   ``That's my next film, `Double Impact.' I'm going to play (a)
twin,'' he said. ``I'm going to play a guy like a James Bond, very
clean, very charming. ... In real life, I'm very hyper, a very
happy person. I'm always laughing. In all those movies I'm very
serious. That's not my nature.''
   Van Damme's newest movie is MGM-UA's ``Death Warrant'' in which
he plays an undercover cop from French Canada (which helps explain
the accent). Railroaded into a California prison, he defends
himself with the only weapons available: his feet.
   Born 29 years ago in Brussels, Van Damme began studying martial
arts at 11, and became a middleweight champion as a teen-ager. He
also grew up loving movies, and he left a thriving gym business to
try his luck in Hollywood. He worked as limo driver, carpet layer,
bouncer and karate instructor while seeking jobs in movies.
   ``The problem was when I came in this country I wasn't legal,''
he said. ``When you don't have a green card, you have to do all
those jobs to make money. I'm very legal now, but it was very
difficult.
   ``It's good in one sense because you can see what's going on in
the bottom. When you start in the bottom with low-budget movies,
you have to work with everybody, and you can see what's going on
with the crew, you respect all the people. ... It's a big family.
It's not just you, it's a big family.''
   A villainous role in ``No Retreat, No Surrender'' led to an
alien part in Schwarzenegger's ``Predator.'' Then he became a star
in ``Cyborg,'' ``Bloodsport'' and ``Kickboxer.''
   Naturally, the Van Damme films are popular in Asia, and he's
beginning to pick up fans elsewhere.
   ``I am growing all over, very nicely,'' he said. ``Not too fast,
not too slow, just perfect. ... Nobody knew me in the U.S. market
before, so they bought the movies in videos. I started to have a
relationship with the video people; now they come to see me in
theaters. So it's growing very nicely.''
   Van Damme realistically views the future: ``The future will
decide my destiny. It's what's on the screen that will pay off.
It's difficult to say I'm going to do this or that. I'm going to go
with life.
   ``The most important thing is to stay hungry. ... I know it's
going to take time. I've got to build a reputation, I've got to
connect with the people watching those movies and the press and
everything. It's going to take time, but I think - I think - I'll
be there.''

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After devoting 20 years to his
three-volume history of the Civil War, Shelby Foote figured he was
finished with the era and could get back to work on his seventh
novel.
   Enter documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, who enlisted him as a
commentator for ``The Civil War,'' the epic, 11-hour TV series
starting Sunday and running five nights on PBS.
   Suddenly, a national audience has ``discovered'' Shelby Foote.
   ``This Civil War stuff is driving me crazy. I thought I had my
discharge,'' he says in the quiet, upstairs study where he wrote
the final volume of his 3,000-page history, ``The Civil War: A
Narrative.''
   ``People keep wanting me to come somewhere and speak and I enjoy
it. But I disapprove of it,'' Foote said. ``I'm doing it, but it
really takes me out of my work.''
   Foote, 73, writes in longhand with an old-fashioned pen and
inkwell, aiming for 600 words a day. ``It makes me take my time and
get it right,'' he said.
   His used his southern storyteller's touch in his history, and
his courtly Mississippi drawl is the documentary's unifying voice.
He has a scholar's insight and a sympathetic feeling for both sides
of the conflict.
   Foote said he was drawn to the documentary by Burns' insistence
on historical accuracy. Words like ``truth'' and ``accuracy'' come
up often in a conversation with him. ``Without that,'' he said,
``you've got nothing.''
   Narrative history, Foote said, was the only way to write about
the Civil War. ``Narrative history is the kind that comes closest
to telling the truth,'' he said. ``You can never get to the truth,
but that's your goal.''
   A three-time Guggenheim fellow and recipient of a Ford
Foundation fellowship, Foote finished his sixth novel, ``September,
September'' in 1978. Then he went to work on his reading. He did
nothing else for three years.
   ``Whenever I do anything that I consider gives me the right to
do it, I sit down and spend a month reading Marcel Proust,'' he
said. ``I've read `Remembrance of Things Past' eight times as a
reward for various things.''
   Foote grew up in Greenville, Miss., and was a lifelong friend of
author Walker Percy. A part-time ``jackleg reporter'' for Hodding
Carter on The Delta Star, he also edited his high school newspaper
and was often at odds with his principal.
   Rejected by the University of North Carolina in 1935, he learned
that the principal was behind it but went to enroll anyway. ``When
I got to the desk, they said, `We told you not to come.' I said, `I
know you did, but I didn't think you really meant it.' ''
   He stayed two years, taking whatever courses he wanted,
regardless of their value for a degree. After college, he took
make-do jobs and worked on his first novel. With war on the
horizon, he joined the National Guard in 1939.
   Foote was a field artillery captain training in northern Ireland
when a superior officer ``insulted one of my men on an inspection.
I made him apologize to the man,'' he said.
   Not long after, he was court-martialed for ``falsifying a
government record'' - his mileage on a jaunt in military vehicle.
It cost him his commission. He was discharged and returned to the
United States.
   Foote worked in the New York bureau of The Associated Press, but
journalism didn't appeal to him.
   He joined the Marine Corps. ``The Marines had a great time with
me. They said if you used to be a captain, you might make a pretty
good Marine,'' Foote said. The war ended before he made private
first class.
   He went back to Greenville to write commercials for a radio
station. ``Then I sold my first story to the Saturday Evening Post.
I quit my job and haven't had another one since,'' he said.
   Foote's first novel ``Tournament,'' begun before the war, was
published in 1949. Then came ``Follow Me Down'' in 1950, ``Love in
a Dry Season'' in 1951, ``Shiloh'' in 1952 and ``Jordan County'' in
1954.
   That year, Random House asked him to write a one-volume history
of the Civil War. He took the job but soon realized it would
produce nothing new. He proposed a three-volume history.
   ``They had various meetings, I suppose,'' he said, ``and in a
week or 10 days, they wrote back and said `Go ahead.' I went ahead
for the next 20 years.''

<TEXT>
   Americans were not always so thin-obsessed; a
belly once was a sign of prosperity. As the middle classes began to
prosper, however, their figures did, too, and plump became
decidedly ordinary. The yearning for a thin body has developed into
far more than a temporary fancy.

   In childhood, chef David Liederman recalls his brother and his
stepfather lunging - forks first - toward the last pork chop. Dad
speared the brother, and in the chaos, Liederman came up with the
chop.
   ``We were so eager to get to the portion that we barely tasted
what we were eating and whatever hit the table was devoured as if
hit by a buzz saw,'' he said.
   Liederman was off on a decades-long journey of devouring that
eventually led him to map trips through France aimed at hitting as
many three-star restaurants as possible. At 38, he topped 300
pounds.
   He opened two New York City restaurants and a chain of chocolate
chip cookie shops, called David's Cookies. And though he has
dropped 100 pounds, kept it off for three years and writen a book,
``David's Delicious Weight-Loss Program,'' he remains obsessed with
food.
   ``My biggest project in life is keeping from getting fat,'' said
Liederman, now 41. ``If you believe the way I do that compulsive
eating is not only a sickness but an addiction, how do you get rid
of the problem without spending the psychological energy?''
   One therapist likened his situation to ``psychological
tyranny.'' But Liederman, for now, is content.
   He carries a pocket diary everywhere, recording every single
taste of food in tiny little letters, down to the spoonful of clear
broth and mushroom soup tasted at his Broadway Cafe. He is fanatic
about daily exercise, usually with a trainer. At 5-foot-11 and
about 180 pounds, he looks healthy and moves fast.
   ``My goal in life is for someone to say, `You look terrible,
David. Eat something,' '' he said.
   Millions of Americans feel an immediate affinity with those
words. Half the adult women and 30 percent of adult men in this
country are on a diet. Americans spent more than $30 billion trying
to lose weight or keep it off last year, and a congressional
committee is investigating the industry.
   Still, an estimated 34 million American adults are obese - that
is, they weigh at least 20 percent above their ideal weight.
   ``The aesthetic ideal is so lean, and now athletic, that it's
simply impossible for many people to attain that ideal,'' said
Kelly Brownell, co-director of the Obesity Research Clinic at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``Many people lose to a healthy weight,
but they don't feel satisfied.
   ``They push beyond to the aesthetic ideal, and their body fights
back, their body wins, and they end up at a higher weight.''
   Americans turn to self-help books, relaxation techniques,
Overeaters Anonymous, Weight Watchers, modified fasts, liquid
diets, liposuction, wired jaws, stapled stomachs, grapefruits,
acupuncture, hypnotism, fatty photos on the refrigerator, fake
fats, artificial sugars, jogging, spas, aerobics, Stairmasters,
gyms, drugs.
   Dieting is part of the mainstream; going off a diet is failing.
   That philosophy is part of the problem, according to therapists
who say food represents other problems. If people learned to eat to
ease hunger for food, rather than hunger for love or something
else, most eventually would reach a weight that's good for them,
they say.
   Financially, emotionally and physically, Americans are paying
for being so persistently and obsessively focused on an ideal they
most likely will never attain. Why?
   For one thing, women, and men to a lesser extent, are victims of
a culture that worships a sylphlike figure to the virtual exclusion
of other body types.
   ``You can't work with women and not work with eating problems,
body image,'' said Andrea Gitter, a therapist at the Women's
Therapy Center Institute in New York City who specializes in eating
problems.
   ``It touches on everybody's insecurity. The underlying message
is that you're not OK as you are,'' said Gitter, who was a
compulsive eater until she learned to eat to satisfy physical
hunger rather than to stave off guilt, loneliness or other
emotional longings.
   Women often believe that if they are thin, if they control their
appetites, they will be happy, loved and respected, Kim Chernin
writes in ``The Obsession.''
   Losing weight, Hillel Schwartz argues in his book ``Never
Satisfied,'' has become ``the modern expression of an industrial
society confused by its own desires and therefore never
satisfied.''
   The obsession strikes girls early. A 1986 study in San Francisco
found that of 500 girls in grades 4 to 12, almost 80 percent of
10-and 11-year-olds reported dieting to lose weight.
   And many parents have overreacted to researchers' warnings that
television-addicted children would grow obese; nutritionists had to
admonish parents not to take all the fat out of their children's
diets.
   That provides a glimpse at one of the strange aspects of
America's obsession with weight: One need not be overweight to live
a lifetime dieting.
   Few people feel content with their bodies.
   A sort of daily tally sheet is set up: An hour pedaling the
exercise bike equals a dish of Haagen Dazs. No breakfast makes
fries OK at lunch. A husky guy buys a bag of chips, stuffs a few
handfuls in his mouth and tosses the bag in a sidewalk trash bin
before he eats too many.
   Every ounce Oprah Winfrey or Liz Taylor gain and lose is watched
by an America gleeful that the famous are no better than we are at
keeping thin.
   Most people believe thin people get paid better, get more dates,
live longer, have fewer diseases. But Chernin notes this sense of
well-being is precarious, since most of those who lose weight put
it all back and more.
   The solution remains as elusive as the diet that lets you eat
what you want and lose weight.
   ``The history of the diet industry in America probably
represents one of the most astounding triumphs of 20th-century
capitalist enterprise,'' Joan Jacobs Brumberg writes in ``Fasting
Girls.''
   ``There is nothing that isn't sold without a thin female body
next to it,'' says Susan Gutwill, also with the Women's Therapy
Center Institute. ``It's really immoral. It's criminal in a very
serious way.''
   The $32 billion spent to get thin last year is $10 billion more
than was spent just four years ago. And Marketdata Enterprises, a
research firm in Valley Stream, N.Y., predicts the market will top
$50 billion by 1995.
   Research may provide more clues to the causes of obesity, but
one fact doesn't change: To lose weight and keep it off, you must
develop healthy eating and exercise habits for good, the experts
say.
   Even then, you may have to accept a body chunkier than a
model's.

<HEAD>UNDATED: a model's.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yo-yo dieting - repeatedly losing and regaining weight - may be
more dangerous to the cardiovascular system than remaining somewhat
overweight, and may even promote weight gain, researchers say.
   Long-term dieters also need to become educated about nutrition.
For example, while the typical American diet includes about 40
percent of its calories from fat, many experts recommend 20 percent
to 30 percent.
   ``They really have very little idea what a portion size means in
terms of cutting it,'' Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the Obesity
Research Center at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, said
in a recent speech. ``They have very little idea of how much fat is
in a food they eat or how much sugar there is in a food they eat.''
   Liederman knows his nutrition, exercises daily and appears to
have motivation in abundance. But will he keep his weight off?
   ``I could regress. I could find some rationale I can't
foresee,'' Liederman said. ``I could still fall off the wagon.''
   Frightening, to a dieter.
   By World War I, when this country had its first best-selling
diet book, there also was a U.S. Food Administration. Herbert
Hoover, as its head, called on the nation to eat less.
   ``Fatness was careless, selfish, wasteful, treacherous and
un-American,'' Schwartz wrote. ``There was to the culture of
slimming between 1930 and 1960 an element of fear that the more one
had, the emptier one would be.''
   In 1952, the director of the National Institutes of Health
declared obesity the primary national health problem. In 1960, a
fitness enthusiast called Jack LaLanne had the largest national
daytime television show audience. And before the decade was out, a
skinny model called Twiggy became an idol.
   Obesity today is considered a major health problem, associated
with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, joint problems
and other diseases. Much, however, remains unknown.
   ``We don't yet understand how most heavy people get to be
heavy,'' Brownell said.
   Genetics, metabolism, culture, psychology and other things all
play a role, but their relative importance is not fully understood,
although some people are heavy simply because they eat too much and
exercise too little. Many fat people, however, eat no more than
thin people. Their bodies seem to use calories less efficiently.
   Maintaining weight loss seems harder than losing it. Estimates
of the recidivism rate commonly top 90 percent, though Brownell
suspects that is too high, especially for hospital-based
comprehensive programs.
   These are odds to attract only the foolhardiest bettor, but in
dieters hope springs eternal.
   David Liederman faces his obsession his way, every day. There's
his theater district restaurant, the Broadway Cafe; his East Side
French restaurant, Chez Louis; and David's Cookies, little takeout
shops where the huge chunks of chocolate ooze out of the dough.
   ``When I was over 300 pounds, I convinced myself I had to taste
each batch of cookies - this one might be different than that
one,'' Liederman said.
   Until his doctor told him he might not live to see his daughters
grow up.
   Neither of his young daughters is overweight, but he is
vigilant.
   ``It scares me because I know what it did to me,'' he said. ``If
I didn't have this problem, I'd be a lot more productive.''

   A congressional subcommittee resumes its investigation into the
diet industry, which critics say government has given too much
freedom.
   In the 1970s, at least 58 deaths were blamed on very low-calorie
liquid diet programs. Today's programs are safer, though
complications still are possible, according to a recent study
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``They have always focused on losing weight fast, but the
medical community is overwhelming in the view that for the majority
of people, losing weight fast can do them more harm than good,''
said U.S. Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of a House subcommittee
on regulation, business opportunities and energy. The subcommittee
held two hearings in the spring on health risks, false advertising
and profiteering in the diet industry.
   ``If people look beyond the `Promised Land' approach, plus we
can get the (federal regulatory) agencies to do their job, we're on
the way to a more sensible approach,'' Wyden, who at 6-foot-4 and
165 pounds never has dieted to lose weight, said in a telephone
interview.
   At Monday's hearing, the subcommittee will consider enforcement
efforts aimed at diet promotions and marketing; dieting among
adolescents and whether restrictions or warnings are needed for
laxatives and other products used to lose weight; and chemical
additives in diet products.
   In a subcommittee staff memo to Wyden, the lack of federal funds
for research into obesity is noted. ``Cumulatively, basic diet
research at the federal level totals about $12 million per year,
and research directed specifically at obestity treatment consumes
another $2 million annually.''
   This, the memo notes, is from an overall National Institutes of
Health research budget of $6.5 billion.
   About adolescents, the memo says that while diets are not
targeted toward teen-agers, young people misuse ``readily available
and uncontrolled diet products as a means of furthering dangerous
diet practices.''
   ``In the face of the significant public health problem presented
by obesity, federal policy remains fragmented and undeveloped,
diulted and dwarfed in comparision to the research effort on less
widespread health concerns,'' according to the memo.

<HEAD>Early Diet Book Holds Up Thin Ideal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Food Obsessed, b0954-b0955</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Diet and Health with a Key to the Calories,'' published in
1918 and written by a physician, was the first best-selling diet
book in this country, according to Joan Jacobs Brumberg's history
of anorexia.
   It's full of good humor, but makes it cleaeal
had already taken hold. The author, Lulu Hunt Peters, uses names
like ``Mrs. Sheesasite, whose husband bought her freight scales,''
Mrs. Tiny Weyaton and Mrs. Ima Gobbler.
   Some excerpts:
   - To her readers whor that a thin id want to gain weight, she says:
``I am not
particularly interested in you, anyway, for I cannot get your point
of view. How anyone can want to be anything but thin is beyond my
intelligence.''
   - ``Now fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but
you are a joke no longer. Instead of being looked on with friendly
toleranace and amusement, you are now viewed with distrust,
suspicion and even aversion! How dare you hoard fat when our nation
needs it?''
   - ``Yes, you eat too much, no matter how little it is, even if
it be only one bird seed daily, if you store it away as fat. . . .
(And between you and me, Mrs. Weyaton, just confidential like -
don't tell it - we know that the small appetite story is a Medicine.
   That's obviously good news for people who want to reduce fat
intake, and it also may pay off for weight-watchers, she said.
   The federally financed study focused on six men who spent 24
hours a day for 13 days in a laboratory, where researchers could
precisely measure what they ate. The men did not know the purpose
of the study, and they were kept busy with a variety of tasks.
   Each man ate a high-fat, 844-calorie lunch during one three-day
period, and a low-fat, 431-calorie lunch in another period. Both
lunches consisted of submarine sandwiches and salad. The men could
not distinguish between the two versions.
   Beginning one hour after lunch, the men could choose from a
variety of foods to eat. Analysis showed that if they had eaten the
low-calorie lunch, they later made up the difference in calories,
mostly at dinnertime.
   But no such compensation occurred for fat, Rolls said. That
suggests fat substitutes ``certainly are going to be an aid to help
people to try to reduce fats in foods,'' she said.
   Hopkins researcher Richard Foltin, lead author of the study,
cautioned that the men were not free to eat whatever they wanted
for lunch. So the evidence is only suggestive that in everyday
life, low-fat food would reduce total fat intake, he said.
   Adam Drewnowski, director of the human nutrition program at the
University of Michigan's School of Public Health, called the study
valuable.
   He also said nobody knows what happens to overall fat intake
when people know they are eating low-fat products.
   Rolls said she doubts those people make up for missing fat. ``I
don't think people think in terms of `I want to eat fat,' '' she
said.
   Although the study found no difference in calorie intake, the
reduction in calories from fat may still be good news for those
trying to lose weight.
   Recent research suggests calories from fat are more fattening
than those from carbohydrates. That is because the body uses less
energy to convert fat calories to body fat than it uses to convert
carbohydrate calories, Rolls said.
   In theory, then, cutting back on fat may help in losing weight
beyond just the effect on reducing calorie intake, she said.
   Fat substitutes hit the headlines in February when the Food and
Drug Administration approved a substitute called Simplesse for use
in frozen desserts. Simplesse is made by Nutrasweet Co.
   Kraft General Foods Inc. is also seeking FDA approval for a fat
substitute to be used in frozen desserts.
   Another proposed substitute, olestra, could be used in cooking.
Olestra is not absorbed by the body, so it would not contribute any
fat or calories, says its developer, Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   The company proposes that olestra replace some fat in oil and
shortening used in the home and in commercial frying.
   Frito-Lay Inc. is studying an experimental fat substitute,
dialkyl dihexadecymalonate, which it says cuts fat by 60 percent
when blended with oil for frying tortilla and potato chips.

   Despite a new focus on being healthy rather than
merely thin, anorexia and bulimia continue to haunt young women,
and the number of men who suffer from eating disorders appears to
be growing.
   The last decade was full of images of the dangers of eating
disorders, on television and in movies and women's magazines.
   An anorexic teen-ager was a character in the movie ``Down and
Out in Beverly Hills.'' Jane Fonda told the world she had suffered
from bulimia. Karen Carpenter lost her life to an eating disorder.
Even a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit included an anorexic cookbook.
   The diseases have not gone away, though experts say estimates at
the time that 30 percent of college women suffered from them were
exaggerated. And new pressures have come to bear on those who are
susceptible.
   ``It's not good enough just to be thin, but one has to have
muscles in the right places, for a man or a woman. You get into the
fat content of your body, how much muscle tone,'' said Leonard S.
Levitz, clincal director of the Renfrew Center in Philadelphia,
which in 1985 became the first residential facility for treatment
of eating disorders.
   So now there is ``exercise bulimia,'' in which sufferers turn to
extraordinary amounts of exercise rather than, or in addition to,
laxatives or vomiting.
   Anorexia is estimated to be two to four times as common today as
30 years ago. Bulimia also appears to be more common. The best
estimates seem to be that 1 percent to 3 percent of college women
are afflicted, Levitz said.
   Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation, an intense
fear of becoming fat and a feeling that one is fat, despite being
emaciated. Bulimia involves a pattern of binge eating followed by
purging by vomiting or with diruetics.
   Although anorexia was identified in 1873 by a London physician,
there is a centuries-long history of women controlling their
appetites, Joan Jacobs Brumberg wrote in her book ``Fasting
Girls.''
   In the 1300s, St. Catherine of Siena was said to eat only a
handful of herbs a day. In the midieval period, fasting was central
to female holiness.
   Bulimia, however, is newer, becoming epidemic only in 1973 or
1974, when ``a lot of trends came together in terms of broad
societal issues, concern over body weight, role of women, people
being under tremendous pressure to be perfect, the breakdown of
family life,'' Levitz said.
   A victim ``feels powerless in the world, no sense of control of
her life, and a real fear that if her eating, like her emotions,
got out of control, who knows what would happen,'' Levitz said.
   Treatment generally is an intensive combination of therapy,
education and behavior modification.
   These generally are diseases of intelligent women, found in the
middle and upper classes of developed countries. The incidence
appears to be increasing in Scandinavia, Japan and Germany.
   New research is showing that many of those who suffer from
eating disorders dieted as preteen-agers, were sexually abused, or
abuse drugs or alcohol, Levitz said. Also linked to the disease are
such issues as fear of growth into womanhood.
   At adolescence, girls come to think of the normal changes
occurring in their bodies as fatness and enter a war of wills to
control them. Boys, however, take pride in their growth.
   The overwhelming majority of people with eating disorders are
women, but experts say more and more men are afflicted,
particularly those involved in weight-conscious pursuits like
wrestling, dancing or modeling.
   Is there a way out?
   Said Levitz: ``Yes, I think there's a way. And I used to be more
hopeful about it happening. The main thing we have to do is change
people's perceptions of how you deal with different body weights.
How you look is a part of how you are as a person. And there are
many, many other things that are equally or more important.''

   At 300 pounds, Helen weighs a little more than
she'd like. But at 280, she feels OK. She just thinks it's too bad
everyone doesn't see her the way she sees herself.
   ``I was raised to judge myself, my own success,'' said Helen,
who spoke on condition her full name not be used. ``It's how do I
feel, and I feel good about myself.''
   Helen, 49, credits a positive atmosphere during her childhood.
   People tell her she looks 35, and she jokes that if she loses
weight ``all the wrinkles will show up.''
   Helen wears sexy bathing suits, dances, has no trouble
attracting men and is becoming something of an activist by speaking
out as a member of the non-profit National Association for the
Advancement of Fat Acceptance.
   Founded in 1969, NAAFA has about 3,000 members in this country
and Canada. Its aim is to spread the word that everyone, no matter
their weight, has a right to a life of dignity and happiness.
   It does not advocate dieting and tries to debunk ``myths such as
that you can lose 10 pounds on a weekend,'' said Barbara Altman
Bruno, a clinical social worker in suburban Pleasantville who
treats women with weight problems.
   ``People are meant to be all different shapes and sizes, like
vegetables,'' Bruno said. ``I don't think everyone is meant to be
thin.''
   Helen said she encounters too many people who don't believe
that. ``People are taught or conditioned to get their image from
the outside world,'' she said.
   ``I learned over the years, at least in relationships with men,
because I have self-confidence and I like myself, whether I'm fat
or thin, I attract all sorts of men,'' she said.
   ``I happen to be a very pretty woman, but I would say I feel a
little more protected when I'm a heavy woman. I sort of attract
nicer men,'' men who are not only interested in appearances, Helen
said.
   Helen has successfully separated her self-worth from her weight,
said Bruno, who sets that goal for the people she treats.
   ``We are so blinded by fear and hatred of fat in this country,''
she said.
   America, NAAFA believes, considers discrimination against fat
people a ``safe'' prejudice that manifests itself in fashion,
availability of insurance, mistreatment by health professionals and
nasty jokes.
   ``In the face of their obesity, our normal standards of humanity
vanish and we are possessed by a form of racist revulsion for the
bodies of these women,'' Kim Chernin writes in ``The Obsession,'' a
philosophical look at the ways women view thin and fat.
   ``Women are still more valued for how they look than what they
do, even though that's been starting to shift'' as women become
more prominent professionally and are less reliant on a man for an
identity, Bruno said.
   Most women think they're too fat, because the ideal is
impossible for most of them. ``Advertising tells us that to be
acceptable as women, we're supposed to be size six and 22 years
old,'' Bruno said.
   Helen and Bruno said they see some positive changes.
   ``Some people are starting to get smart about the
ineffectiveness of diets and liquid diets,'' Bruno said. ``With the
national emphasis on cutting back o fat and cholesterol, a little
of that is being absorbed by some people.''
   More stores carry fashionable clothing for large women, and
doctors and employers are changing their attitudes toward heavy
people, Helen said.
   Still, most experts believe obesity is unhealthy, contributing
to illnesses including heart disease. And heavy people face other
problems.
   In Glen Burnie, Md., in August, a 367-pound woman was required
to take a driving test because authorities thought she might be too
fat to drive safely. Regina Guy passed the test, but was angry.
   ``Fat people are human. We deserve equal treatment,'' said Guy,
25, who was supported by several NAAFA members. ``Because of my
size, I should not be discriminated against.''
   Her lawyer, Christopher Brown, said it was a clear case of
discrimination. ``The only reason she was singled out was because
of her weight,'' he said.
   NAAFA also tries to break a common cycle: Faced with their own
distress and the disdain of those around them, overweight people
diet, lose weight, go off the diet and get fat. Over and over.
   Many experts warn against such ``yo-yo'' dieting as dangerous as
well as counter-productive: When regaining weight, people often end
up fatter than ever.
   Kelly Brownell, in research at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, found rats took more than twice as long to lose
weight the second time around. The difference may be a decrease in
metabolic rate, as the body tries to preserve itself against what
it perceives as starvation.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, diets contribute greatly to
compulsive overeating and to people getting fatter,'' Bruno said.
   The yo-yo syndrome brought tragedy to Helen's life, she
believes.
   She and a boyfriend once lost weight together. In months, he
lost 75 pounds and regained 60. Soon, he had fatal heart attack.
   In the depression that followed, Helen regained her weight, too.
   But Bruno noted that fat people have a lower suicide rate than
thin people. ``For some people, food is a way to assuage a lot of
painful feelings. It works, it's legal, and relatively
inexpensive,'' she said. ``Food happens to be very useful in its
place. And delicious.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress that the Persian Gulf crisis has piled ``new and
substantial risks'' on an already faltering national economy.
   In a generally gloomy assessment of U.S. economic prospects,
Greenspan said Wednesday that the jump in oil prices since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait had increased the threat of both higher
inflation and a recession.
   Greenspan did not signal that the Fed either had eased credit
already or was planning any immediate easing moves.
   Instead, he merely repeated comments made in the past that
financial markets would respond favorably to a credible deficit
reduction package by pushing long-term rates, such as mortgage
rates, lower and the Fed would do its part by helping to lower
short-term rates.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing starts fell 1.7 percent in August to
the lowest level since the last recession eight years ago.
   ``Although we're not technically at a recessionary level, I
would describe the industry as in a recession,'' Martin Regalia, an
economist with the National Association of Savings Institutions,
said after the government released its report Wednesday.
``Recession is a very technical term that gives very little solace
to an individual who has to live and breathe in a particular
market.''

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) - Chrysler Corp. dropped some of the
bluntest hints yet that it won't accept a model contract that the
autoworkers union negotiated with larger rival General Motors Corp.
   Bennett Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors subsidiary,
suggested Wednesday that Chrysler couldn't afford the health-care
provisions of the contract. Robert Lutz, the subsidiary's
president, said the income-protection clauses of the GM contract
looked costly.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Recent reports of big arms sales to countries
in the Middle East may be exactly what's needed for U.S. weapons
contractors looking to offset cuts in domestic defense spending,
analysts say.
   Possible purchases of American jet fighters, tanks, missiles and
other equipment by Saudi Arabia, Israel and even the tiny United
Arab Emirates, has lifted some clouds hovering over the defense
industry.
   ``There are still a lot of unknowns, but our future looks a lot
brighter than it did six months ago,'' said Don Gilleland, a
spokesman for General Dynamics Corp.'s tank-building division in
Sterling Heights, Mich.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Troubled Pan Am Corp. will cut 2,500 jobs and
some routes, while replacing five large airplanes on trans-Atlantic
flights with smaller planes in a bid to emerge as a leaner,
stronger airline.
   Pan Am hopes to save tens of millions of dollars, but the
corporate parent of Pan American World Airways refused to provide a
more precise estimate after meeting Wednesday with airline
analysts.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said Pan Am will attempt to
shift more business into Miami and Latin America, its most
lucrative route areas.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A final decision in the government's
conflict-of-interest case against Neil Bush won't be made until
next spring, a federal regulator said.
   The president's 35-year-old son faces a public hearing starting
Tuesday in Denver on the government's charges against him. Bush was
a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, a
Denver thrift that collapsed in late 1988 at a cost to taxpayers
estimated at $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking an order against
Bush that effectively could bar him from working for a bank or
savings and loan. Bush denies any wrongdoing.

   ATLANTA (AP) - The economy may be sliding into a recession and
Atlanta's mid-1980s boom may be over, but economists say the 1996
Olympic Games will give the area an economic shot in the arm that
could last into the 21st century.
   ``Atlanta will be a pocket of prosperity in a dismal national
scene,'' said Jeffrey Rosensweig, an assistant professor of finance
at Emory University Business School.
   The Olympics will have a $3.5 billion financial impact on metro
Atlanta, including $1.2 billion in direct spending by the Atlanta
Organizing Committee, said University of Georgia economist Jeffrey
M. Humphreys.

   MUSTANG, Nev. (AP) - The Mustang Ranch, Nevada's oldest and most
infamous legal brothel, shut down after filing for bankruptcy
liquidation. A trustee says the U.S. government will try to operate
the business until it can be sold.
   A lawyer for owner Joe Conforte said Wednesday that Internal
Revenue Service harassment killed a $5 million deal to sell the
bordello - more than 100 bedrooms on a 440-acre ranch - and forced
it into liquidation in Federal Bankruptcy Court.
   Officials said Conforte owes $13 million in federal taxes.
Conforte has said the debt is no more than $7 million.

   The stock market turned downward Wednesday as hopes waned for
any impending moves by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had edged up 7.18
points over the week's first two sessions, dropped 13.86 to
2,557.43.
   The dollar finished mostly higher in U.S. trading after surging
in Europe. Gold fell.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply. Cotton futures
soared. Livestock and meat futures were mixed. Energy futures were
mixed. Precious metals fell.
   Bonds were mostly higher.

   Recent reports of big arms sales to countries
in the Middle East may be exactly what's needed for U.S. weapons
contractors looking to offset cuts in domestic defense spending,
analysts say.
   Possible purchases of American jet fighters, tanks, missiles and
other equipment by Saudi Arabia, Israel and even the tiny United
Arab Emirates, has lifted some clouds hovering over the defense
industry.
   ``There are still a lot of unknowns, but our future looks a lot
brighter than it did six months ago,'' said Don Gilleland, a
spokesman for General Dynamics Corp.'s tank-building division in
Sterling Heights, Mich.
   News accounts suggest the Saudis want between $18 billion and
$23 billion worth of weapons in response to the threat from
neighboring Iraq. Israel has requested faster delivery of and
additional planes and helicopters.
   Gilleland said he's heard speculation that the United Arab
Emirates is interested in buying 250 tanks.
   ``About $20 billion would be a nice shot in the arm for the
defense industry. I understand it would be pretty far-reaching
too,'' said Lawrence Harris, a stock analyst for Bateman Eichler
Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles-based investment firm.
   ``But the long-term future of the defense industry is going to
remain a function of U.S. defense spending industry and not that of
foreign countries,'' Harris said.
   Foreign sales won't prevent scheduled layoffs by the major
contractors, but they may buy time for the industry to adjust to
changes at the Pentagon.
   Analysts said the Persian Gulf military buildup may help prevent
deep cuts in he defense budget, currently under discussion in
Congress, but won't change the trend toward shrinking the amount of
money Americans pay for the military.
   Offsetting that continuing decline with foreign orders is the
challenge for the nation's defense contractors, analysts said.
Three months ago that may have seemed unlikely with the Cold War
turned tepid, but the Persian Gulf crisis has changed things again.
   The nation's two biggest contractors, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and General Dynamics, both stand to benefit from the reported
sales, as will smaller contractors elsewhere.
   McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, makes the F-15E jet
fighter, which both the Saudis and Israelis want. The plane has
never been sold to another country, though its predecessor, the
F-15C, is flown in Japan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
   Company aides declined to comment on the possibility of
increased sales to other countries.
   The F-15E program is scheduled to build its final plane in
mid-1992, although industry analysts expect the U.S orders to keep
production going until mid-1993. Foreign sales could keep the
program alive into 1996.
   ``Now's the time to make hay while the sun's shining. Let's get
those orders nailed down and maybe we can stop any more layoffs
down the road,'' said Cassell Williams, president of the company's
largest union, the International Association of Machinists &amp;
Aerospace Workers.
   His union, which consists of almost 11,000 production and
maintenance workers, has largely escaped the sweeping layoffs at
McDonnell Douglas, which announced a plan in July to cut up to
17,000 jobs nationwide and save $700 million this year.
   About 100 of the union's members have been laid off, Williams
said.
   The big cuts at the aerospace giant came at the white-collar
level with middle managers and engineers baring the brunt. New
overseas orders aren't likely to help them.
   ``The layoffs are being driven by our need to improve
profitability. . .not by declines in the defense budget,'' said
Barbara Anderson, a company spokeswoman. ``That means the upturn in
military sales would have very little impact on the layoffs.''
   At General Dynamics, based in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton,
speculation about foreign orders for M1A2 tanks, F-16 jets and
Stinger missiles also won't reverse plans to lay off 1,500 to 2,000
workers at two missile plants in Southern California by the end of
1991, spokesman Christopher Schildz said.
   ``We have not received any immediate, significant sales as a
result of the Persian Gulf crisis and we have no way of predicting
how the crisis will affect future sales,'' Schildz said.
   It's the same story at Lockheed Corp., based in Calabasas,
Calif., which manufactured nearly all the transport planes used to
move eguipment and troops to the Middle East and makes the
radar-fooling Stealth aircraft that have been sent to the region.
   The company already has cut 5,500 jobs this year and is planning
another 1,700 cuts to bring companywide employment to about 75,000
at the end of the year.

   General Motors Corp.'s proposed pact
with the United Auto Workers union would be too expensive for
Chrysler Corp. to match, executives say.
   ``GM may have deep pockets and we don't,'' Chrysler Motors
Chairman Bennett Bidwell said Wednesday.
   Chrysler especially objects to health-care provisions in the
pact, which the union hopes to use as a pattern for contracts with
Ford Motors Co. and Chrysler. The GM-UAW agreement carries over
health-care provisions from the latest contract.
   Health-care costs are a big issue at Chrysler, which has more
retirees and an older work force than GM or Ford Motors Co.
Chrysler has about 60,000 active UAW-represented employees and
almost the same number of retirees, who typically file more health
claims than younger, active workers.
   Executives at Chrysler, which spent $684 million on health care
last year, have said since bargaining began July 20 they would find
it difficult to follow a pattern set with the larger, more
profitable GM or Ford.
   But the pattern tradition is essential for the UAW. Chrysler
workers are wearing buttons saying: ``Pattern or Picket.''
   ``I'm hopeful that reasoned minds can come up with some ways to
ease that burden a little bit without shattering the concept of
pattern,'' Bidwell said.
   The UAW and GM reached a tentative labor agreement early Monday,
two days after expiration of the existing contracts between the UAW
and the Big Three. Talks with Ford and Chrysler were put on hold
pending the outcome of GM talks and won't resume until the GM
contract is voted on by rank-and-file union members later this
month.
   The automakers said when they opened national contract
negotiations with the UAW last July that health-care costs would be
a major issue.
   At the opening of UAW-Chrysler negotiations, company Vice
President Anthony St. John proposed a multi-employer health-care
trust to hook Chrysler up with other companies. The result would be
a large health-care group able to get lower health care rates by
volume.
   The UAW rejected that idea.
   It appears Ford can live with the GM-UAW contract, although
Chrysler may have to spend cash it's holding as a hedge against its
weakened credit rating.
   Other portions of the GM-UAW agreement are disconcerting to
Chrysler. GM has set aside $4 billion in income-protection programs
that will pay full wages to workers laid off for more than 36 weeks
over the next three years.
   ``On the surface, it looks expensive,'' Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz said Wednesday. ``Job security is simply
something that cannot be legislated.''
   The UAW hasn't said whether it will bargain next at Chrysler or
Ford. Ford's 12,800 workers in Canada struck over money issues for
the fifth day Wednesday.
   Chrysler is expected to lose money in the third quarter, in part
because of production time lost to retool its plants for new
minivan models, the company's biggest sellers.
   Earnings in the first half of the year were 67 percent below
last year and car and truck sales for the first eight months of the
year were about 15 percent below last year. Two Japanese
automakers, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp., sell more
cars in the United States than Chrysler.
   While it introduced several new and sporty cars Wednesday, the
company still is short of new products for the early 1990s. Car
buffs and analysts alike say much of Chrysler's product line is
stale.

   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden has enrolled British and Japanese regulators in
his campaign to raise the amount of capital investors must put up
to buy stock index futures on credit.
   Officials from Japan and Britain joined Breeden Wednesday in
issuing a joint communique that called stated the need to maintain
balance between stock markets and the markets for derivative
products such as stock index futures contracts through higher
margins.
   The joint statement was issued following 1{-days of meetings at
a conference center in the rolling hill country of northern
Virginia.
   In attendance were John Redwood, undersecretary for corporate
affairs of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry; David
Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board for the
United Kingdom; and Nobuhiko Matsuno, director-general of Japan's
Securities Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.
   ``Given the internationalization of the world's securities
markets, we felt it was important for the regulatory authorities of
the three largest markets to have an opportunity to meet and review
common concerns and common objectives,'' Breeden told reporters
after the session ended.
   In their first three-way meeting, the regulators pledged to:
encourage trading among their countries and expand their
cooperative supervision of it; to strengthen formal agreements on
the exchange of investigative information.
   But the section on margin levels was a small political coup for
Breeden, who has been urging higher margins for stock index futures
in this country.
   Stock index futures are a hybrid financial product that allow an
investor to bet on the rise or fall of a number of stocks without
having to buy the underlying securites that make up the index.
   And a margin is the down payment paid by an investor buying
securities or futures contracts on credit. In the U.S. securities
markets, margins are set by the Federal Reserve Board and are as
high as 50 percent of the securities' price. In the futures
markets, margins are set by the exchanges themselves and are
generally far lower.
   Breeden and other critics of low futures margins claim they
encourage risky trading practices that lead to sharp price swings
in the markets.
   In their communique, the three regulators said that margin
levels for stock index futures and other derivatives should be
``adequately high in the event of a sharp market decline.''
   At a press briefing at the Georgian revival mansion where the
conference was held, Walker, one of the British officials said they
were glad to participate in a discussion of ``the general
philosophy'' of margin control.
   While London's stock index futures and options markets were
``growing extremely rapidly'' the rate of growth was much less than
in the United States or Japan.
   Matsuno said Japan had recently raised margin levels from 9
percent to 15 percent ``so as to recover the imbalance between the
cash markets and the derivative markets'' although ``we have seen
no notable effects of this.''
   The United States has had memorandums of understanding with
securities regulators in both Britain and Japan since 1986. But
those pacts are limited in scope compared to subsequent agreements
reached with other countries, such as Brazil and Switzerland, to
exchange information and assist each other's investigations of
fraud and other violations.
   Breeden said the focus of Wednesday's meeting was not reaching
specific agreement on policy matters but ``on clearing away
obstacles.''
   In addition to margin levels, the regulators agreed to encourage
cross-border business between markets in their countries by
``pursuing mutual recognition of regulatory systems,'' including
disclosure requirements and systems for clearing and settling
transactions.
   They also agreed to exchange information on a regular basis ``to
the extent possible within legislative constraints'' to monitor
multinational firms operating in all three countries. They renewed
their intention to assist each others' investigations into
securities law violations.
   The three said they have agreed to meet again in Britain in the
late spring or early summer.

   Despite cutbacks intended to save tens of
millions of dollars, Pan Am Corp. faces turbulent times in a market
that is proving tough even for healthier airlines.
   Pan Am said Wednesday it will eliminate 2,500 jobs from Pan
American World Airways in a bid to become leaner and stronger.
   The troubled carrier will also reduce its capacity by 7.5
percent next year through a series of moves that will include the
loss of some routes and the replacement of five large airplanes on
trans-Atlantic flights with smaller planes that use less fuel.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said the cutbacks will occur
as Pan Am seeks to concentrate more business in Miami and Latin
America, where its profits are the greatest. But Pan Am's success
in becoming stronger is far from certain, analysts said.
   ``This is going to be a difficult thing for them to do, but it's
not impossible,'' said George James, president of Airline Economics
Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Washington.
   ``We face tough times,'' Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey F. Kriendler
acknowledged.
   Plaskett said Pan Am's changes are being made in response to
rising jet fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel that have
delt a particularly hard blow to ailing carriers. Pan Am reported
losses of about $2 billion during the 1980s, and recent efforts to
find a merger partner met no immediate success.
   Pan Am plans by mid October to eliminate the 2,500 jobs, from
the ranks of management and labor that now total about 29,000.
About 500 management jobs will be scrapped, Kriendler said.
   About half the cutback will likely be accomplished through
layoffs, while Pan Am hopes to achieve the rest through attrition
and voluntary leaves of absence. Pan Am was still trying to figure
out where to make all the cuts, which will force remaining
employees to work harder, Kriendler said.
   ``We know there will be no pilots affected,'' Kriendler said.
``About 550 are flight attendants, but all have agreed to take
voluntary leaves of absence for three to nine months.''
   Kriendler declined to offer more specifics about where the cuts
might be made. He said Pan Am hopes to save tens of millions of
dollars, but he would not be more precise.
   The Teamsters union, which represents about 6,500 of the Pan Am
workers, issued a statement through its Airline Division on
Wednesday saying Pan Am has indicated about 650 Teamsters would be
laid off.
   Teamsters have periodically conducted scattered strikes against
Pan Am in recent months, and the union said Wednesday it was hoping
to stop truck deliveries at the key Kennedy Airport operation in
New York and other Pan Am locations.
   Teamsters local leaders were meeting in Washington to discuss a
more comprehensive strategy against Pan Am.
   The airline said its other moves were intended to reduce
capacity by 7.5 percent in 1991.
   Pan Am will eliminate unprofitable feeder service into New
York's Kennedy from Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Austin and San
Antonio, Texas; and Cincinnati. Pan Am's commuter subsidiary, Pan
Am Express, would keep flying from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia into
Kennedy, Plaskett told airline analysts during an afternoon
meeting.
   As part of the cutbacks, Pan Am will stop leasing five of the
412-seat Boeing 747s now in its fleet of 35 and replace them with
A310300s that carry less than half as many passengers, but also
use less fuel.
   Plaskett said the larger planes are ideal for peak summer
travel, but the smaller planes are more profitable on an annual
basis. They will be assigned to flights from Kennedy to Milan,
Italy, and Madrid, as well as on flights from Washington-Dulles to
Frankfurt and London.
   Pan Am said it plans to get two new models of the smaller planes
for next summer's peak season, flying them from New York to Zagreb,
Yugoslavia, and from Newark, N.J., to London.
   Although the carrier's capacity will be down by 7.5 percent,
departures will be down just 3.5 percent, and the number of miles
flown will be down 2.3 percent when Pan Am's cutbacks are all put
in place by April, Kriendler said.

<HEAD>Commercial News Show Signs 4,200 Schools in 45 States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Channel One news show is back in operation,
delivering 12 minutes a day of topical teen-oriented stories along
with pitches for candy, sneakers and chips to classrooms in 45
states.
   Creators of Channel One say they are more than halfway toward
their goal of signing 8,000 schools. But they have failed to shake
the critics who contend it is wrong to deliver a captive audience
of students to advertisers.
   Meanwhile, an advertising-free daily news program for use in the
schools from the producers of Cable News Network is claiming a
growing following.
   More than 12,000 schools have indicated interest in using the
program CNN Newsroom in the classroom and executives at Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. say their surveys indicate about half of
those schools are using it regularly.
   Other cable TV networks, such as C-SPAN, The Discovery Channel
and The Learning Channel, are either producing shows or stepping up
efforts to promote existing ad-free services for use in the
classroom.
   But it was Channel One, the commercial program from Whittle
Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., that ignited a passionate
debate about television's proper role in classroom education.
   Whittle tested its program in six schools in the spring of 1989,
and made it available to schools nationwide starting this past
March.
   Schools that agreed to show the program to all of their students
every day got a loan of videocassette recorders, TV monitors for
every classroom and wiring to tie the system together. They get to
keep the equipment as long as they keep showing the program.
   That's been a tempting proposition for many schools that Whittle
says would otherwise be poorly equipped to make use of TV programs
that could help students learn.
   It is paying for the equipment and the costs of producing the
daily news show by selling up to two minutes of commercial time in
each 12-minute show.
   After taking the summer off, Channel One resumed programming at
the end of August with an advertiser lineup that includes M&amp;M-Mars
Inc., Nike Inc., Frito-Lay Inc., Magnavox electronics and Columbia
Pictures.
   Some advertisers have simply run ads touting products. But Nike
has used some time for anti-drug messages and Burger King Corp. is
using all its time for ads to discourage school dropouts.
   The shows itself use flashy graphics, maps and often tell
stories from a teen perspective - Arab teens in the Mideast were
interviewed in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait about how
their lives had been changed.
   Farrell Reynolds, a onetime Turner Broadcasting executive who
now oversees Whittle's educational operations, said about 4,200
schools have signed three-year contracts to take Channel One and
that 3,500 are actually receiving it.
   He said those schools have more than 3.1 million students and
are in every state except Maine, Rhode Island, Nevada, Alaska and
Hawaii.
   Public schools in New York, Rhode Island and California have
been told they can either not accept ad-supported programs such as
Channel One or risk losing state funds by carrying it. But Reynolds
said parochial schools in the New York and Los Angeles areas have
signed up.
   He said it is becoming easier to sell the program to schools and
advertisers now that they can see what the shows are like. ``We are
not getting complaints aboyut the advertising,'' he said.
   Paul Jones, superintendent at Southgate Community Schools in
suburban Detroit, said students are used to seeing ads and pay
little attention to those shown in school. He said teachers have
used the ads to teach lessons about marketing and sales techniques.
   But the ads bother Pat Wright, principal at Carrollton High
School 50 miles west of Atlanta and an avid subscriber to the
ad-free CNN Newsroom show.
   ``I don't think you can talk to a class about Iraq and Kuwait
for several minutes, take a 60-second (commercial) break ... and
come back to it while keeping any consistency,'' he said.
   He said the ads also ``take unfair advantage of a captive
audience'' of students who are required to be in school.
   John Kuglin, who uses CNN Newsroom every day with his
fourth-grade class at Cold Springs School in Missoula, Mont., said
he sees no need for a commercial news show because of the
availability of an ad-free alternative.
   CNN Newsroom follows a format of news stories taken from regular
CNN reports, a feature on a topic in science, technology,
international events or business and a third segment devoted to a
teen-oriented feature such as career opportunities. Like Channel
One, it make liberal use of locator maps.
   CNN Newsroom was launched in August 1989, making its debut after
Whittle completed the test of Channel One, but before Channel One
went naitonal. The 15-minute show runs five days a week on CNN.
   Louis Pugliese, project director of Turner Educational Services,
said there are no precise figures on how widely the program is used
but estimated that about 6,000 schools use it regularly.
   While Turner offers no equipment to go with the show, he said
several cable TV system operators have taken steps to see that
schools can receive it and some have even donated TVs for use in
the classroom.

<TEXT>
   Ladies of the night who have kept the red
lights burning at America's best-known brothel have a new employer
- Uncle Sam, by way of federal Bankruptcy Court.
   The Mustang Ranch, Nevada's oldest legal bordello, shut down
Tuesday after filing for bankruptcy liquidation. On Wednesday, a
court trustee took charge of the money-losing business until it can
be sold or creditors are paid off.
   Prostitutes who had earlier fled out of fear that tax collectors
were about to raid the place filtered back Wednesday, some to pick
up belongings and others to resume work at the 105-room brothel.
   ``I want to come back, but I'm not going to work for no
government,'' said a woman who identified herself only as Beth.
   ``A lot of girls don't like the idea of working for Uncle Sam,''
said 22-year-old Bree. ``They don't like the idea of having to pay
taxes. But I know I'm going to give it a try. If I don't like it,
I'll go to the Chicken Ranch outside Las Vegas.''
   A lawyer for owner Joe Conforte said Internal Revenue Service
harassment killed a $5 million deal to sell the bordello and forced
it into liquidation. Officials said Conforte owes $13 million in
federal taxes. Conforte put his debt at no more than $7 million.
   The Mustang was an illegal operation when Conforte and his wife,
Sally, opened it on a 440-acre ranch 10 miles east of Reno in the
1950s. It became the state's first legal brothel in 1971.
   The bordello had been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
since 1982, meaning it operated under court supervision while it
tried to pay off creditors. Two attempts to sell the business
through stock offerings failed.
   Jeri Coppa, who previously managed smaller brothels in Nevada in
her role as bankruptcy trustee, said she hopes to have the Mustang
reopened for business by the weekend. She said officials from
Bankruptcy Court will be on location at all times to make sure
things run smoothly and that the government gets its due.
   ``My whole thing is if you're running a business, you're running
a business,'' said Coppa.
   Plans to reopen immediately were blocked by state health rules,
which require any prostitute who leaves the premises to be retested
for sexually transmitted diseases. That can take three days.
   The prostitutes must undergo monthly checkups. Clients must wear
condoms.
   Some 45 prostitutes, bartenders and floor supervisors signed up
to resume work. Coppa said the IRS assured her it would not harass
the women for back taxes.
   When the Mustang first opened, prostitution was tolerated but
illegal in Nevada. It was burned down by local authorities in 1960
as a public nuisance.
   Conforte won Storey County approval for the brothel 11 years
later, pioneering the movement to allow prostitution in 11 of
Nevada's 18 counties.
   Prostitutes rented rooms at the ranch, which also got half their
earnings. They accepted credit cards, in advance.
   Conforte fled to Brazil in 1981 after being convicted of tax
evasion but returned in 1983 in a deal with prosecutors to testify
against U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne. Conforte claimed
Claiborne took $85,000 in bribes.
   After a hung jury resulted in a mistrial, prosecutors dropped
charges related to Conforte. Ultimately Claiborne was convicted of
hiding more than $100,000 in income from the IRS. He was later
impeached.

<BYLINE>Olympia &amp; York May Sell Minority Interest In Most U.S. Properties</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Olympia &amp; York has hired an investment bank to
sell a minority equity interest in most of its U.S. holdings,
according to published reports.
   The private Toronto-based real estate company, which counts the
World Financial Center in New York among its holdings, has hired
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to handle the sale, the reports said.
   The amount of equity for sale was cited as almost 20 percent in
one report and 25 percent in another.
   The company is also trying to refinance its Canary Wharf
complex, Europe's largest real estate development of offices,
stores and a hotel on the Thames River in London. The project is
reportedly about 50 percent complete.
   The New York Times quoted unidentified Wall Street executives
familiar with Olympia &amp; York's recent business dealings as saying a
chief reason for selling an interest in some of its U.S. holdings
was to raise more cash for other projects, including the London
project.
   The Times said the amount for sale is a 25 percent equity
interest in most of Olympia and York's commercial properties in the
United States.
   John Zucotti, president and chief executive of Olympia &amp; York
Companies USA, declined to tell the newspaper what percentage of
which properties was being sold to partners. But one executive
outside the company said Lazard had used the 25 percent figure in
its talks with prospective institutional buyers.
   The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, said the Reichmann family,
which owns Olympia and York Developments Ltd., was seeking to sell
almost a 20 percent interest in its massive U.S. real estate
portfolio.
   The newspaper said real estate professionals said the interest
could sell for between $200 million and $800 million.
   It said Zucotti denied speculation that the company has a
cash-flow problem as many real estate concerns do.
   Zucotti told the newspaper the move was in the works for months
and is intended to put intop the hands of a single institutional
investor minority holdings in properties conrtrolled by a variety
of Reichmann family members.
   The Journal said the properties involved include commercial
projects in New York City, Boston, San Francisco and other major
U.S. cities.

<HEAD>Northwest Gets $500 Million Loan From Airbus, GE</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines, heading into a tough
earnings period sparked by the fuel crisis, has received a $500
million loan from General Electric Co. and European aircraft maker
Airbus Industrie, a published report said today.
   The loan agreement may have given Airbus and GE an edge against
competitors in securing a deal to sell Northwest 75 new planes,
according to today's editions of the Wall Street Journal.
Northwest's parent, St. Paul-based NWA Inc., recently agreed to
order the Airbus A-320 aircraft and take options on 30 more in a
deal valued at $4.6 billion. A GE joint venture is supplying is
supplying engines for the aircraft.
   According to the Journal, Seattle's Boeing Co. also was
competing to supply the planes to Northwest.
   Spokesmen for Northwest and GE were not immediately available
for comment.
   But Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie of North America,
confirmed to the Journal that Airbus arranged the loan with
Northwest during negotiations over the aircraft order.
   Boyd declined to say how much of the $500 million came from
Airbus. He said the new planes will serve as collateral for the
loans.
   Officials familiar with the transaction say the carrier plans to
use the loan to repay debt resulting from its acquisition last year
by an investor group that included Alfred A. Checci, the Journal
reported. The group borrowed about $3 billion to buy the airline;
about $1.7 billion of debt remains.
   The Journal said the deal reduces the chance that the carrier
will face a cash crunch during a period of sharply higher fuel
prices and soft domestic passenger traffic. Northwest says its fuel
bill this year could increase by $180 million.
   To cope with higher fuel prices, Northwest raised fares 5.3
percent last month, and has slated an additional 4.2 percent
increase for Oct. 1.
   But Northwest faces other financial hurdles. The carrier faces a
Sept. 29 deadline for from the Department of Transportation to find
a replacement for $225 million of a $400 million equity investment
from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The Journal said, however, that the
government is likely to grant the carrier an extension.

<HEAD>EC Oil Stocks Have Risen Since August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's oil stocks
have risen since early August, a senior official of the
organization said Thursday.
   Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC's energy commissioner, said
inventories were up despite the break in oil supplies from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   He said the EC believed ``stocks must be kept for a graver
situation,'' warning that an ``unjustified signal of instability,''
would be sent if the International Energy Agency recommended its
members began drawing on their inventories.
   Cardoso e Cunha said he could not put a figure on the EC's oil
reserves but noted the 105 days of oil consumption stocks recorded
in early August was ``very comfortable.''
   Questioned on whether the EC could replace its former Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude imports with oil from the Soviet Union, the
commissioner said that ``under present technical circumstances we
cannot replace our dependency on Middle East sources.'' He said the
lost Kuwaiti and Iraqi production was being replaced by other
Middle Eastern sources.
   But he said energy opportunities in the Soviet Union were a
``key point'' in current trade and economic cooperation talks with
Moscow.

<HEAD>Sony Introduces New DAT Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. has announced a new lineup of digital
audio tape recorders that includes a Walkman-size model, saying it
believes the technology will duplicate the success of compact
discs.
   The new equipment, known as DAT, and CDs use computer-like
digital signals to reproduce sound, but DAT machines also allow
consumers to make recordings that can rival studio equipment in
sound quality.
   The new Sony DAT lineup features two top-of-the-line machines, a
car player, and a Walkman weighing 1.4 pounds including
rechargeable battery. It will go on sale in North America and
Europe in December and January.
   ``Sony believes 1991 will be a year of takeoff for DAT,'' Kozo
Ohsone, senior general manager of Sony's Audio Group, said
Wednesday. ``We see a growing market for DAT, linked to the growing
importance of digital equipment.''
   Ohsone said he believes sales of DAT equipment will follow the
pattern of CDs and become widely popular in two or three years.
   Sony said the DAT Walkman, to be marketed in Japan for $710, is
the first that includes all circuitry needed for recording from
both digital sources such as CDs, and analog sources such as
microphones.
   ``It's Walkman for hi-fi maniacs,'' a Sony official said.
   Portable DAT machines also have been announced by Aiwa, Sharp,
Hitachi and JVC.
   The car player, with a built-in FM-AM tuner, will go on sale in
Japan in December for $870, Sony said. It uses a new technology in
which each track on the tape is read twice by a spinning head and
the better version selected to minimize the effect of vibration,
Sony said.
   All of the new machines also can play at half speed, allowing up
to four hours of playback time but at reduced sound quality.
   Although DAT recorders were first introduced in Japan three
years ago, sales have been slow because of their high cost, the
lack of prerecorded tapes, and opposition from record companies
worried that DAT's ability to make near-perfect copies would
encourage record piracy.
   But last year, international record and electronic industry
groups agreed on a new DAT technical standard which prohibits the
machines from being used in making second-generation recordings
from CDs.
   Equipment using the standard was first introduced this summer
around the world, including in the United States.
   ``The response was greater than we expected, and as a result we
are introducing a full range of DAT equipment,'' Ohsone said.
   He said Sony has sold about 30,000 of its current DAT model in
the two months since then, with about 70 percent of the sales in
Japan.
   DAT is likely to face continued sales resistance because of the
prices, which are only moderately lower than models already on the
market.
   But its chief threat in the future may be other emerging
technologies, such as recordable CDs and a new digital tape system
being developed by Philips.
   ``The technology is already developed. It's just a matter of
what will sell,'' Ohsone said.

<TEXT>
   American General Corp., which has tried
unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the whole company, said it may
settle for divesting only its large insurance unit.
   The board of directors of the Houston-based financial services
concern announced Wednesday that a new restructuring plan calls for
the sale of its home service life insurance business, which
represents more than half of American General's operating earnings.
   The rest of American General's operations in consumer finance,
real estate and mutual funds would be retained as a public company
under the new plan.
   ``In May of this year, we committed ourselves to maximizing
current shareholder values through the sale of the company as a
whole,'' the directors said in a news release.
   ``This marketing effort has been unsuccessful to date, but the
restructuring plan provides an alternative for maximizing
shareholder value in the near term, through the tax-advantaged sale
of our most significant business segment,'' the release said.
   The news sent American General stock reeling Wednesday. It
tumbled $6.37{ a share to $33.62{ in composite New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   American General stock had traded as high as $50.62{ a share
earlier this year when it was facing a $50-a-share takeover bid
from Torchmark Corp. American General turned down Torchmark's
offer.
   The home services operation would include companies that
concentrate on the sale and service of traditional insurance
products directly through employee agents. These businesses have
assets of $8.9 billion, equity of $3 billion and generated earnings
of $305 million in 1989.
   The main businesses of a restructured American General would
include a tax-qualified annuities unit, real estate operations and
a consumer finance subsidiary. Together, they have assets of $24.9
billion and equity of $3.5 billion. In 1989, those American General
businesses earned $235 million.
   Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive officer of American
General, said the board opted to consider a restructuring given the
``current international and economic uncertainty,'' which has
discouraged potential interest in the company in its entirety.
   The restructuring plan was not a result of ``active
negotiations'' with any one buyer, the board said.
   The plan would have to be approved by the Internal Revenue
Service and by certain federal and state regulators.
   American General has subsidiaries operating in all 50 states and
Canada.

<HEAD>Philips Withdraws From Joint Venture With AT&amp;T</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NV Philips, the Dutch electronics
giant, on Thursday confirmed a week-old rumor that it would sell
its 15 percent stake in a telephone equipment company set up
jointly with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   Philips said it was selling its share in AT&amp;T Network System
International to its U.S. partner, but spokesman Cor Vreven denied
the transaction was part of a cost-cutting operation begun this
summer by the company's recently appointed chairman, Jan Timmer.
   AT&amp;T's share in the joint venture, based in the Dutch city of
Hilversum, is being boosted from 59 to 74 percent as a result of
Philips' withdrawal.
   The venture, founded in 1984, makes sophisticated electronic
switching devices for public telephone systems. Philips and AT&amp;T
inititally held equal shares, but Philips gradually reduced its
holding.
   Last week, AT&amp;T sold 6 percent of its stake in the venture to
Telefonica de Espana SA of Spain. The other partner in the venture
is the Italian Stet Group, at 20 percent.
   Vreven said the sale won't affect the other activities of
Philips' telecommunication division, which employs about 15,000
people and develops and manufacturers equipment for data
communication, radio, rural telephone, public cable transmission
and network management systems.
   Timmer warned July 2 that as many as 10,000 Philips' jobs might
be lost worldwide under the restructuring and projected a loss of
up to $1 billion despite the job reductions.

<HEAD>Xerox Introduces Workstation, Software To Bring Far-Flung Offices
Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Co-workers who are based in far-flung
offices worldwide will be able to collaborate on projects using a
new computer and software from Xerox Corp.
   The key technology, announced Wednesday, isn't the computer
Xerox introduced - a $10,000 workstation made by Sun Microsystems
Inc. - but the machine's basic software, called GlobalView.
   ``GlobalView will help project teams scattered throughout
different locations in mid- to large-size companies accomplish more
and in far less time than previously possible,'' said Joseph
McGrath, vice president of marketing for Xerox Integrated Systems
Operations.
   GlobalView combines many of the basic features of an office
computer, such as software to do word processing and printing,
along with special functions to automate the tasks of groups of
workers who collaborate on projects.
   Based on shared ``documents'' that combine text, graphics,
spreadsheet tables and other data, GlobalView lets a worker
manipulate the information even when it is on a distant computer.
The changes are instantly available to the worker's colleagues
through the company's computer network.
   So far, few such ``groupware'' products have been brought to
market, and buyers have been reluctant to embrace the ill-defined
concept.
   Xerox hopes its software, along with an integrated printer and
electronic scanner it intends to unveil in the next month, will
persuade buyers they can benefit from groupware, thus raising
Xerox's low visibility in the computer industry.
   ``What they're trying to do here is (make) a broad offering of
interest to companies with offices around the world,'' said Vera
Allen-Smith, an industry analyst with Dataquest Inc., a
high-technology h firm in San Jose.
   GlobalView is based on the company's Viewpoint software, which
until now worked only on Xerox's proprietary computers. It has been
modified to run under Sun's version of AT&amp;T's Unix operating system
on the new Xerox 6520 workstation, which is being manufactured for
Xerox by Sun.
   Xerox also announced a $3,995 kit that lets GlobalView run under
IBM's OS-2 operating system, which is designed for personal
computers. The kit includes the software, a 19-inch black-and-white
monitor and an add-in board for the IBM Personal Computer AT and
compatible machines.
   Analysts said one problem Xerox may face with the software is
that it is designed with an out-of-date ``user interface,'' the
on-screen graphics and symbols through which the user controls the
computer. The user interface is similar to the one Xerox invented
in the 1970s.
   Other companies, notably Apple Computer Inc., have made so many
improvements to the Xerox interface, which includes a mouse and a
screen partioned into windows, that the Xerox system is now far out
of the mainstream, analysts said.

<HEAD>Say Trump Misses Loan Payment, Wants Delay on Shuttle Loan
Payments</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with comments from Trump executive. No Pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald J. Trump has failed to make a
$1.1 million loan payment for the Trump Shuttle and is seeking to
reschedule $245 million in loans on the airline, a top aide said
today.
   The missed payment and delay request comes less than a month
after the beleaguered real estate-gambling entrepreneur concluded a
$65 million bank bailout critical to keeping other elements of his
empire afloat.
   The Wall Street Journal said Trump and two aides met Wednesday
with officials from Citibank, asking the bank to restructure debt
payments on the shuttle, which provides service on the Boston-New
York-Washington corridor.
   Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization, confirmed today that the meeting had occurred and
said bank officials ``have been very encouraging so far in helping
us through these problems.''
   He said Trump had failed to make a $1.1 million payment that
came due in the past few days. He declined to say whether that
payment would be made.
   ``It's too early to get into a discussion of terms of the
restructuring,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The Journal story said Trump was expected to make the payment,
but is not expected to be able to keep up with payments estimated
at about $30 million due in the next 12 months.
   He said Citibank had prepared a memo to other banks that bought
pieces of the loan dealing with the requested rescheduling and that
he expected another meeting between Trump officials and the banks
would be set up for next week.
   Officials at Citibank declined comment on the matter.
   Bollenbach said the primary reason for requested rescheduling
was the depressed state of the economy in the Northeast which has
led to a sharp decline in traffic and revenue on the shuttle route.
   ``The whole market is down,'' he said, referring to both the
Trump Shuttle and its main competitor, the Pan Am Shuttle.
   In addition, he said the cost of fuel has ``more than doubled''
since early summer. Fuel prices have soared in the wake of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, which raised the risk of a supply
disruption from the region.
   Bollenbach said shuttle managers are operating the airline
efficiently, and that the banks were being told that the shuttle
had become unprofitable for reasons ``totally outside of
management's control.''
   The $245 million in loans at issue in the latest talks were not
included in the discussions that led last month to the $65 million
bank bailout on about $1 billion of Trump's $2 billion bank debt,
Bollenbach said.
   The loans under discussion were part of the money Trump borrowed
to buy the shuttle from Eastern Airlines for $365 million in 1989.
