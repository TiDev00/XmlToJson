   A leukemia patient whose plight prompted 50,000
people to step forward as possible bone-marrow donors will undergo
a transplant of bone marrow from her mother Thursday, a hospital
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The operation on Allison Atlas, 20, is expected to take at least
four hours and could last six hours or more, said Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center spokeswoman Alice Burgess.
   Doctors are scheduled to extract the marrow from Miss Atlas'
mother at 9 a.m., the spokeswoman said.
   The marrow from her mother matches only four of six antigens, or
cell identifiers. But the New York University student from
Bethesda, Md., decided to undergo the operation while she is still
strong enough.
   She began chemotherapy July 31, and has responded well, Burgess
said.
   Doctors said a patient with Miss Atlas' type of leukemia can
expect a 60 percent chance of recovery if the transplant marrow is
perfectly matched. Without a transplant, they say the disease is
100 percent fatal.
   In leukemia, a form of cancer, white blood cells multiply
uncontrollably. Bone marrow produces blood, and doctors can combat
the cancer by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy tissue.
   Miss Atlas' condition prompted a campaign by her family last
fall to find a perfectly matched donor. They were unsuccessful, but
the effort raised $3 million to process blood samples from the
50,000 people in the United States and Israel who volunteered.
   Ten patients found perfect donors.

   Britain, France and Australia announced Thursday
they are sending ships and planes to the Persian Gulf in response
to U.S. appeals for help with a multinational force to defend Saudi
Arabia against Iraq.
   U.S. officials were busy Thursday trying to muster global
support for the force, sent in to defend against any Iraqi invasion
of Saudi Arabia, which neighbors Iraq and Kuwait. However, only
Britain and Australia announced they would send hardware and troops
as part of the force.
   French President Francois Mitterrand announced Thursday evening
that his nation was increasing its naval and air forces in the Gulf
``as needed to intervene'' if necessary.
   He said they would coordinate with the international force but
remain under French command.
   British officials said they would immediately send two fighter
aircraft squadrons, anti-aircraft missiles and other air and sea
forces totaling more than 1,000 men to the Persian Gulf.
   Defense Secretary Tom King told a news conference that Britain
will send a squadron of Tornado F3 fighter jets from Cyprus and a
squadron of Jaguar ground-attack fighters from England, as well as
a number of Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft. The Ministry of
Defense said each squadron includes 12 planes.
   Two British frigates will arrive in the gulf this weekend to
join the destroyer, HMS York, and three minesweepers will be
deployed, initially to the eastern Mediterranean, King said. A
squadron of Rapier ground-to-air missiles is also being sent, he
said.
   Mitterrand said his country will send an aircraft carrier to the
gulf region, bolstering French naval and air forces already there
to counter any new aggression by Iraq.
   After a two-hour emergency Cabinet meeting, Mitterrand also
promised France will send war materials and technicians to the gulf
as requested by Saudi Arabia and other states.
   ``France will, there as elsewhere, continue to exist in
solidarity and coordination with countries like the United States,
but only under French officers,'' Mitterrand told reporters.
   In Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said his
country will send two frigates and a supply ship as part of the
international force.
   He said they will be used ``to enforce the blockade on Iraq and
Kuwait and protect the exports from other oil-producing
countries,'' he said.
   Western leaders have talked of a blockade if a U.N.-organized
global embargo against Iraq fails.
   ``I believe the gravity of the situation warranted this
action,'' Hawke told a news conference.
   He said the ships will be able to leave Australia within five
days and arrive within 22 days.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, whose forces invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2, has denied any intention of attacking Saudi Arabia.
However, Western reports say his troops have massed on the Saudi
border.
   U.S. soldiers were steaming into Saudi Arabia on Thursday.
   The Pentagon declined to detail the size of the U.S. deployment,
but Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said all F-15 fighters sent to
Saudi Arabia had arrived, as have five AWACs reconnaissance planes.
Six U.S. warships stand by in the Mediterranean and two aircraft
carrier groups are positioned in the Red and Arabian seas, he said.
   Mideastern diplomatic sources said the U.S. buildup would total
at least 40,000 troops backed by more than 100 jet fighters.
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti on Thursday told British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher that Italy has not been asked to join
the multinational force in Saudi Arabia, according to the Italian
news agencies ANSA and AGI. They cited unidentified sources in the
premier's office.
   His spokesman could not be reached to comment.
   Several nations, including Canada and The Netherlands, have said
they will decide whether to participate in the U.S.-led force
following separate meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and European Community foreign ministers in Brussels,
Belgium, on Friday.
   Portugal, West Germany, Italy and Spain have offered use of
bases. Greece on Wednesday allowed nine U.S. support planes to pass
through its airspace on their way to the gulf.
   Egypt and Morocco, mentioned by U.S. Defense Department sources
as the likeliest Arab participants, refused to join. President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt proposed that an Arab force act as a buffer
between Kuwait and Iraq.
   That proposal was expected to be on the agenda at an Arab summit
meeting in Cairo, which was postponed to Friday.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrived in
Ankara on Thursday, indicated he may ask Turkish President Turgut
Ozal to permit the United States to use that country's military
bases as staging areas in the event of strikes against Iraq.
   ``It goes without saying that Turkey is strategically very
important,'' Baker said on his flight from Washington. Turkey
borders Iraq.

   A young soldier offered to plead
guilty to a burglary he said he didn't commit so he could ship out
for Saudi Arabia with his unit. But a jury quickly found him
innocent Thursday, and he was on his way.
   Pfc. Joseph Cufferi, 20, was accused of breaking into a
neighbor's house in October 1989 while home on leave.
   Cufferi said he got together with friends, drank ``approximately
10 beers'' and had some trouble getting into what he thought was
his parents' home.
   He was actually two doors down at the home of Robert Anthony
Keller.
   ``I remember ringing the doorbell and going around and saying,
`Let me in.' I thought that was my house,'' Cufferi said.
   But when Keller heard the backyard gate open and saw the
dark-clothed man trying the French doors, he thought Cufferi
intended to hurt his family, Assistant State Attorney Thomas Lawson
told the Palm Beach County Circuit Court jury on Wednesday.
   ``He spent about 15 minutes knocking,'' said Assistant Public
Defender Karen Ehrlich. ``Burglars don't knock.''
   Keller said he told Cufferi to leave, but the soldier kept
banging doors and windows. So Keller grabbed a shotgun, pointed it
through the window at Cufferi and threatened to shoot, Keller said.
Cufferi ran but was later caught by police and charged with
attempted burglary.
   ``I'm sorry I went to the wrong house, but it was a mistake,''
Cufferi said Wednesday. ``But now I need to go do my job. I defend
the United States of America.''
   Some members of his unit, the 24th Infantry based at Fort
Stewart, Ga., were due to leave Thursday.
   Prosecutors agreed earlier in the week to allow Cufferi to plead
guilty to the lesser charge of trespassing, but he rejected the
deal. However, he changed his mind after learning his unit was
shipping out, apparently believing he'd be allowed to go after
pleading guilty.
   But the Kellers refused to go along with the deal, and Cufferi
went on trial.
   On Thursday, a hopeful Cufferi parked his packed car near the
courthouse.
   The jury took only 15 minutes to decide his fate.
   ``The first thing we did was take a vote and it was unanimous _
not guilty,'' said juror Tim Kelly.
   Thursday night, Cufferi's father said his son called from Fort
Stewart to say he'd arrived in time to catch up with his buddies.
   ``I'm glad that at least through all of this he was able to be
where he wants to be,'' said Jospeh Cufferi Sr.

   Soldiers packed and shipped out to the Middle East on Wednesday,
leaving behind frightened civilians and tearful wives and fiancees.
Others rode the rumor mill wondering if they would be the next to
be mobilized.
   ``They're going. They are definitely going. There is no doubt in
my mind that this is another war,'' said Effie Parsons, 23, a clerk
at a convenience store near Fort Bragg, N.C., home of the 82nd
Airborne Division.
   President Bush ordered U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia to help it
repel a potential attack by Iraq, which invaded neighboring Kuwait
last week.
   Bush specifically mentioned the 82nd. Pentagon sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said they also expected deployment of
the 24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. and the 101st
Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. Elements of those three
units would be deployed with the 18th Airborne Corps, a control
unit at Fort Bragg that directs the combat divisions, the sources
said.
   A soldier at Fort Bragg, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said about 2,000 soldiers from there were to go to Saudi Arabia and
that some of that force had left Tuesday night.
   On Wednesday, truckloads of soldiers and supplies were seen
driving toward Pope Air Force Base, which adjoins Fort Bragg. At
least two large civilian jetliners that could be used to haul
soldiers landed at Pope.
   Around 8:50 p.m., a steady stream of C-141s began leaving the
air base, and continued leaving for at least 30 minutes at
intervals of a few minutes. About two hours later, at least four
planes were heard leaving or landing.
   Early in the week, convenience store clerks said sales of
chewing tobacco, batteries and insect repellent were brisk as
soldiers hurriedly stocked up.
   ``A lot of fathers are coming in with their kids, holding them
real tight'' and many wives are in tears as they make their
purchases, said Ms. Parsons.
   Assistant store manager Wade Felman, comparing this deployment
with the Panamanian deployment of December 1989, said the
atmosphere now is much more tense and wives coming in are more
nervous.
   ``The Panamanian thing, I guess, seemed so small to them,'' he
said. ``I think this thing is a little more worrisome.''
   One of the 82nd's soldiers, Pfc. Mark Ohmer, was to marry Angela
Nelson, 19, in suburban Detroit this Saturday. The $6,000 wedding
was postponed when he was called back to base.
   ``It happened so fast. I'm so upset,'' Nelson said. ``Iraq does
a lot of chemical warfare, and Mark's job is to deactivate chemical
weapons and deactivate contamination of soldiers. He also was
taught to dismantle bombs.''
   While the Pentagon sources said the 101st Airborne also was
going, spokesmen for the 14,000-soldier division at Fort Cambpell
continued to deny that Wednesday.
   That didn't convince people just outside the post gates in
Clarksville, Tenn., and Fort Campbell, Ky.
   ``Everybody's a little nervous; you never know what can
happen,'' said Tammy Bradford, whose husband Mike is a 101st
infantryman. Mrs. Bradford, at work at a restaurant, said she tried
not to think about the possibility that he could be ordered to the
Middle East.
   ``I think we should be out there to stop Iraq,'' she said. ``But
I don't want my husband to go.''
   ``I feel something's going on on the base at Fort Campbell that
we're not aware of and we shouldn't be aware of,'' said Morrell
Boyd, owner of a cleaning shop in Clarksville.
   Boyd said the number of soldiers bringing in uniforms to be
cleaned or mended had not increased over the past two days. ``But
those that are coming in are needing it in a rush,'' he said.
   At Fort Stewart, Army officials tightened security Wednesday
night as members of the 24th Infantry loaded their gear into
desert-tan trucks and Bradley fighting vehicles.
   Army officials refused to say whether the division would deploy
to Saudi Arabia to help protect the oil kingdom from an Iraqi
invasion, but relatives braced for their departure and expressed
concern for their safety.
   Maj. Ron Keeling, a Fort Stewart spokesman, said the division
was conducting a routine emergency deployment exercise.
   Some soldiers had been called back from leave.
   Helmeted soldiers armed with M-16 rifles could be seen trudging
through motor pools with rucksacks and duffel bags. Wives and
girlfriends huddled with soldiers in parking lots. A telephone
operator said long-distance circuits were jammed with calls from
Fort Stewart soldiers.
   Military Police set up checkpoints at some entrances to the post.
   Spec. 4 Norman Aimes, 24, part of the infantry division, said
earlier that he was called back from leave in Utah. ``They called
and said there is a 99 percent chance that we are going,'' Aimes
said Tuesday.
   ``I'm worried,'' said Surshander Armstrong, wife of an Army
specialist at Stewart. ``If you knew exactly what they were going
to do, then the waiting wouldn't be so bad. Then you could prepare
yourself.''

<HEAD>Report: Racketeering Rampant at Fulton Fish Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal administrator appointed two years ago
to help drive organized crime out of the Fulton Fish Market said in
a court report filed Wednesday that racketeering remains rampant at
the huge market.
   In the report filed in U.S. District Court, Frank H. Wohl said
the market was controlled by a few people who set rules for
delivering seafood and practiced extortion.
   He told The New York Times in an interview published in Thursday
editions that strong-arm tactics by some companies discouraged
suppliers from sending fish to New York, driving up retail prices
for local consumers.
   He told the Times that city officials worsened the problem by
abdicating their responsibility to regulate and police the market.
He said he would soon impose rules to help suppliers and businesses
operate at the market without intimidation.
   About 90 million pounds of seafood with a retail value of $2
billion are sold each year at the market in lower Manhattan.
   Wohl said in the report that city officials told him they feared
for the safety of city employees involved in the market and also
feared attempts to corrupt police officers if the city enforced
regulations more strictly.
   He said that although the city had the authority to license and
regulate deliveries, arriving truckers are ``assigned by some
unknown authority to unload their trucks.'' Under this system, his
report said, it costs as much to transport a pound of fish 50 feet
at the market as it does to transport it from New England to New
York City.
   The unloaders charge the wholesalers $1.35 per 100-pound box. If
truckers unloaded supplies themselves, Wohl said, they would be
``subject to physical abuse.''
   Drivers must pay extra to have their fish unloaded promptly, he
said.
   Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for the city Office of Business
Development, told the Times Wohl's report was ``old news'' and
reflected his ``inability to correct the problem'' despite a budget
of $750,000 and a staff of a dozen investigators and researchers.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Religious Group to Distribute Correction to Pamphlet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday ordered a conservative
religious organization to distribute a correction to a pamphlet
used to press its case that the National Endowment for the Arts is
supporting pornography.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge William C. Conner came in a
lawsuit by artist David A. Wojnarowicz against the American Family
Association of Tulepo, Miss., and its executive director, David E.
Wildmon.
   The judge said the pamphlet used cropped images of Wojnarowicz'
work to suggest he created sexually explicit images. Its
distribution had likely harmed the artist's professional and
personal reputation, he said.
   Conner made permanent an earlier injunction that barred any
further publication of the pamphlet, titled ``Your Tax Dollars
Helped Pay for These Works of Arts.''
   The judge also awarded $1 in damages to Wojnarowicz, who had
sought up to $1 million. He said Wojnarowicz had not proven
financial damage because no galleries or museums had canceled
exhibits of his work.
   Conner said Wildmon must send a court-approved ``corrective
communication'' to all who received the pamphlet. The association
sent the pamphlet to 4,000 churches, members of Congress and other
individuals as part of its campaign against the endowment.
   Wildmon had objected to several of Wojnarowicz' works exhibited
earlier this year at the Illinois State University Galleries. A
catalog of reproductions of 60 of his paintings, collages and
photographs was partly financed by the NEA.
   Tim Wildmon, the executive director's son, said the association
had not made a decision on whether to appeal the order to
distribute a correction.
   He praised the judge's decision to award $1 in damages, saying
the action showed ``the lack of validity of his lawsuit.''
   Paul Weiss, one of Wojnarowicz' attorneys, said he believed his
client should have received more money because the controversy
could affect his ability to show and sell his work in the future.

<TEXT>
   Lindiwe Phillip, an
anti-apartheid activist, fled into exile and expected to return
triumphantly in a few months. That was 14 years ago.
   She came home in June, when the government granted temporary
amnesty to dozens of African National Congress leaders so they
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid, the racial
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nation's 28
million blacks.
   Ms. Phillip, now 32, was among thousands of young blacks who
left after the the 1976 student uprisings. Hundreds of people were
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of
militant activists.
   ``I thought (exile) would be very temporary, about three
months,'' she said. ``As time went on, I had to grapple with the
fact that I am in exile and that I can no longer go home.''
   The ANC, South Africa's leading black opposition movement, has
an estimated 20,000 members in exile. The ANC and the government
agreed Monday to clear the way for their return, starting in
September.
   While Ms. Phillip was in exile in Zambia, her parents died.
After she was in touch with her brother about the deaths, he was
killed, and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death.
She still does not know who killed either of them.
   ``I was just heartbroken,'' she said. ``I was almost on the
verge of going nuts, crazy.''
   During her exile, Ms. Phillip received military training and
studied in Cuba and Tanzania. She also worked in the ANC Women's
Section and the Department of Information and Publicity in Lusaka,
Zambia, the ANC's exile headquarters.
   Her feelings were mixed when she returned in June with a group
sent to recruit members for the ANC Women's League.
   ``We had so longed to be back home, but at the same time we were
not sure it was the correct time,'' she said.
   African National Congress members began trickling out of South
Africa when the organization was banned in 1960.
   President F.W. de Klerk lifted the 30-year ban in February. A
law passed at that time empowers de Klerk to grant immunity, but so
far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen ANC leaders
and officials.
   Officials say that, under Monday's agreement, the cases of all
exiles will be reviewed and disputed cases will be handled by a
special commission.
   Mathews Phosa, a lawyer on the ANC negotiating team, fled South
Africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger, but
had to leave his wife and 3-year-old daughter behind.
   ``It is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in
one's life, a very very painful experience _ shattering,
terrible,'' he said.
   What sustained exiles, Phosa said, was unshakeable belief in the
struggle to end apartheid.
   ``You don't know where you are going to exactly,'' he said.
``You are being uprooted from your loved ones. ... You know you are
going to comrades, but that's not enough. You still have to make
new friends.''
   After the initial shock, life in exile becomes normal, the
lawyer said: ``People get married, they fall in love, they work,
and home is not something that haunts you every day.''
   Finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles.
There is a severe shortage of housing for blacks.
   Many will want to catch up on education they missed while
fighting for Spear of the Nation, the ANC military wing, but black
schools are overcrowded, qualified teachers are rare and violence
has disrupted classes for years.
   Recent right-wing violence against blacks and against whites
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles,
Phosa said, ``but that can't be a reason for us not to come home.''
   With ``the political space being there to organize and build our
organization, it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our
cadres inside the country,'' he said.
   ``I think I am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling
blocks. There is a willingness on the part of the government. They
are very slow ... hesitant, but I think they are moving forward and
they should be credited for that.''

<HEAD>Scientists Isolate Marijuana Target in Brain</HEAD>

   Scientists today said they have cloned a
``button'' marijuana presses in the brain, a step that may lead to
medications that mimic the drug's therapeutic effects without
affecting mood or thinking.
   New treatments for pain, high blood pressure, epileptic
convulsions, nausea, asthma and the eye disease glaucoma may
result, other scientists said.
   The new work revealed the chemical makeup of a protein structure
on the surface of brain cells. Marijuana's main ingredient, called
a cannabinoid, binds to this structure to exert its effects.
   The study is presented in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by scientists from the National Institute of Mental Health
in Bethesda, Md.
   Their paper describes the brain-cell structure as it appears in
rats, but further study showed the human structure is virtually
identical, said study co-author Tom Bonner.
   Marijuana is best known for producing a calm, mildly euphoric
state. Time seems to slow down and users become more sensitive to
sights, sounds and touch. Ideas may flow rapidly through the mind
while short-term memory is suppressed.
   The new work opens the door to developing derivatives that
produce medicinal effects without marijuana's undesired ones, said
Dr. Solomon Snyder, director of the neuroscience department at
Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore.
   The newly cloned structure is called a receptor. Many drugs and
natural substances bind to particular receptors to exert their
effects on the body.
   Previous studies suggest that cannabinoids exert a variety of
effects because they bind to a variety of receptor variants, called
subtypes, Snyder said.
   ``So if you could get a derivative that works on the therapeutic
subtype but not the subtype that makes you high, then you would
have an effective drug without the possibility of being a drug of
abuse,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``Drug companies have been working on this for years, but have
been unsuccessful because they didn't have any way to look at these
receptor subtypes that we think exist.''
   Researchers should now be able to use the cloned cannabinoid
receptor to search for related subtypes, he said.
   ``Then a drug company can synthesize lots of chemicals and check
them out on receptor A and receptor B, and then gradually sculpt a
molecule that fits receptor A and not receptor B, and then you have
a super drug,'' he said.
   Bonner said the existence of the receptor suggests that the
brain naturally contains some sort of cannabinoid-like substance.
``The receptor's not there just so that people can go out and smoke
pot and get high,'' he said.
   Finding the brain chemical would shed light on the workings of
the central nervous system and might give clues to developing new
medications, he said.
   In the Nature paper, scientists said they found genetic material
that tells brain cells how to make the receptor.
   When they inserted the genetic material into hamster ovary
cells, the cells produced receptors that behaved as expected when
exposed to cannabinoids.

<HEAD>L-Tryptophan Outbreak Linked to Manufacturing Process</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of a sometimes fatal blood disease
among users of L-tryptophan was blamed by scientists today on
impurities introduced during manufacture of the diet supplement in
Japan.
   U.S. researchers believe the contamination resulted from changes
in the way L-tryptophan was made by Showa Denko K.K., one of six
companies worldwide that manufacture the over-the-counter
supplement in bulk.
   ``We believe that some of the agent has been getting into
L-tryptophan for years,'' said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm. ``But
there was a series of circumstances that may have increased the
agent in the product in late 1988 and at the same time resulted in
lowering the amount removed in the finished product.''
   Osterholm, the Minnesota state epidemiologist, said researchers
are trying to pinpoint the contaminant.
   Showa Denko spokesman Alan Wachter acknowledged that statistical
evidence pointed to the company's product as the cause of the
outbreak. But he said it is uncertain whether the fault lies in
changes in its manufacturing process.
   L-tryptophan was ordered off the market in the United States in
March after it was linked with an outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia
syndrome that has struck more than 1,500 people, killing 27. The
painful disorder can cause high fever, rash, weakness and shortness
of breath, among other symptoms.
   L-tryptophan is an amino acid. It has been sold as a treatment
for insomnia, depression and other disorders.
   Osterholm is senior author of the report in today's New England
Journal of Medicine. He worked with other researchers from the
Minnesota Health Department and scientists from the Centers for
Disease Control and the Mayo Clinic.
   While most of the cases of the blood disease associated with
L-tryptophan were spotted in 1988 and 1989, Osterholm said others
occurred in the early 1980s.
   L-tryptophan is made in fermentation vats by the bacteria
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The researchers believe that the
tainted product may have resulted from two changes in Showa Denko's
manufacturing process.
   They found that the problems began after the company began using
a new strain of the microbe and cut in half the amount of carbon
used to filter out impurities.
   ``What we were able to demonstrate without a doubt was that
there were changes that occurred that let more of it be in there,''
said Osterholm.

   He's been fixing typewriters for
students, secretaries and the literati for more than half a century
in his dusty shop near Yale University. But time and technology
have overrun Manson H. Whitlock.
   ``The typewriter is going the same way as the horse and buggy. I
guess it just isn't meant to be any more,'' said Whitlock, 73, who
will close his doors at the end of the month.
   Whitlock has worked on the typewriters of some of the country's
best known writers: Pulitzer Prize-winners Robert Penn Warren,
Archibald MacLeish and John Hersey; biographer and historian
William Manchester; and ``Love Story'' author Erich Segal.
   Before word processors and personal computers, Whitlock was part
of a spring ritual at Yale. At the end of each school year,
hundreds of students would drop off their typewriters for storage
and servicing over the summer.
   ``We used to sweat it out when September got close. That doesn't
happen any more. This past summer I didn't have a single request,''
Whitlock said.
   ``I'm just so darn worn and weary with it now,'' he said.
   But closing wasn't so easy.
   Longtime customers have been rushing to get their machines in
for repairs before he shuts his doors. He's got a backlog of at
least two dozen repair orders.
   Manchester, a fan of manual typewriters, has been coming to
Whitlock's since the 1950s.
   ``I've never known anyone who works on typewriters that can
match him in any way. He's in a class by himself,'' said
Manchester, writer in residence at Wesleyan University in nearby
Middletown.
   Whitlock started his repair business in 1934 at the age of 17,
working out of his father's book store, itself a New Haven
institution for years.
   ``I've always liked mechanical challenges, and with typewriters
every one has its own personality and characteristics,'' he said.
   Whitlock has never worked on electronic typewriters, which have
computer chips. He hired an assistant to take care of those
new-fangled machines.
   The work has taken its toll. He can no longer fully extend his
right hand, which has spent thousands of hours clutching a
screwdriver.
   His dark cluttered store, with shelves of vintage, jet-black
manual typewriters, has become an anachronism on its block, now a
fashionable home of several eateries, a nightclub, a copying
center, an art shop and Mory's, the storied Yale dining club.
   Reluctantly, Whitlock has begun getting rid of his stock. He
recently threw away over 200 cannibalized machines that had served
as sources of hard-to-get parts and has sold most of his antiques.
Dozens have also gone home with him.
   But there are still some oldies in the store, like the midget
collapsible typewriter weighing less than 7 pounds used by news
correspondents during World War I, and the blue-and-white
typewriter that his father had Smith-Corona make for Yale students
in the 1920s.
   Whitlock refused to entertain any offers to buy the business.
   ``I don't want someone else to have the chance to spoil what
I've done,'' he said.

   Long wary of Saddam Hussein, Saudi Arabia
has for the first time turned to the United States for protection
because of the threat posed by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Not since the early 1960s, when Saudi Arabia responded to the
Egyptian presence in North Yemen, has it made such a major military
commitment to a perceived threat.
   Knowledgeable Saudi officials and Arab diplomats based in the
Persian Gulf said the Saudi leadership has been fearful of Saddam
since he wrested power from Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr in 1979.
   Most of Saddam's neighbors have appeased him to ensure their own
preservation, they said, noting Saddam's decision to wage war on
Iran in 1980.
   ``The Saudis tried to placate Saddam, accepted his promises
about non-aggression and exerted themselves to arrange an
understanding between him and the Kuwaiti government,'' said one
Arab diplomat, speaking on condition his name not be used.
   ``Saddam did the same thing with (Egyptian President Hosni)
Mubarak, who felt insulted when he realized the Iraqi leader was
lying. The Saudis felt not merely insulted but also threatened.''
   Apart from fighting for their own survival, the Saudis feel
indebted to the invaded Kuwaitis for harboring them in the latter
part of the 19th century. The Arabian Peninsula was then part of
the Ottoman Empire, whose leaders had denied the house of Saud
their throne in Riyadh.
   But on Jan. 15, 1902, a young warrior prince called Abdel-Aziz
Ibn Abdel-Rahman Al Saud led 40 desert fighters by camel from
Kuwait to retake Riyadh.
   Aided and encouraged by the benevolent Kuwaitis of the al-Sabah
family, Abdel-Aziz retook Riyadh and instituted the monarchy that
in subsequent decades spread across a vast area covering hidden
treasures.
   The advent of oil transformed both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
almost simultaneously into rich countries. The two ruling families
began vying for political distinction. Jealousies and political
rivalries often overshadowed their kinship.
   ``But the shock of invasion and the flight of the ruling family
pushed to the fore the question of survival,'' said one Arab
diplomat. ``The Saudis had to choose one of two bitter options _
either to back down and wait for their turn to go down under the
heavy boots of some neighboring dictator, or to resort to the
Americans and defy the Iraqis.''
   The Saudis won a denunciation of Iraq's invasion from its allies
on the Gulf Cooperation Council. The council said exiled Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah was the only legitimate ruler of Kuwait.
   Born in the summer of 1981, the GCC groups join Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman in a
military and economic pact.
   State-run radio and television stations, along with
government-guided newspapers in all GCC countries condemned Saddam.
   As U.S. troops headed to Saudi Arabia, the GCC foreign ministers
met in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, denounced the invasion and called for
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   During the 1962-67 Yemen war, the Saudis poured massive weapons
stocks and vast sums of money into Yemen and recruited mercenaries
to evict the Egyptian armies of the late President Gamal
Abdel-Nasser.
   The net gain for the Saudis was the ouster of the forces of
revolutionary regimes from North Yemen.
   At one stage during the Yemeni war the Egyptians sent their
warplanes raiding the southern Saudi border regions of Najran and
Jaizan with poison gas.
   Iraq is known to possess vast quantities of chemical weapons,
which Saddam has said he would use if attacked.

<HEAD>Debilitating Sand, Heat, Threat of Chemical Attack Face U.S.
Troops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few areas of the planet are more forbidding
for the American warrior than Saudi Arabia, home of the world's
largest sand desert, where the summer heat often tops 120 degrees
and can sap even the native tribesmen.
   Drinkable water is scarce. Sand and dust can debilitate not only
armies on the march but also aircraft, supply vehicles and gun
sightings on tanks and rifles.
   Add to that the threat of being attacked with poison gases you
can neither see nor smell, and you have a picture of the
peculiarities of mobilizing on the Arabian Peninsula to defend the
world's largest oil reserves from the Iraqi army.
   President Bush told the nation Wednesday that American forces
were landing in Saudi Arabia to protect the desert kingdom from a
menacing million-man Iraqi army. The president said U.S. troops
would not initiate a conflict but would respond if attacked.
   Government sources said at least 5,000 paratroopers from the
82nd Airborne Division and other highly mobile units were en route
or already taking positions on Saudi soil _ backed by a swelling
armada of naval air and seapower.
   Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said 4,000 Marines already
had been moved to a oil-terminal Saudi town close to the Kuwaiti
border. Those sources said the total U.S. troop strength could
reach 30,000, while The Washington Post and The New York Times
quoted estimates of 50,000.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has vowed to crush any resistance
to his occupation of Kuwait.
   The Saudi desert itself is a formidable foe for the Americans.
The name alone _ the Empty Quarter _ speaks volumes about the
inhospitable conditions.
   The heat can be defeating. Temperatures in August often top 120
degrees; on Tuesday, as the first U.S. air and ground units readied
for their mission, it was 110 degrees in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
   Even without the physical strain of combat, U.S. soldiers in
Saudi Arabia would have to drink at least six gallons of water a
day while their bodies adjusted to the climate, said an Army
planner who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Deliveries of drinking water become nearly as important as
armaments.
   Also on the equipment list for this deployment: plenty of
sunscreen lotion and sunglasses.
   The desert environment presents these other challenges to the
Americans there:
   _Distortion of all optical systems, including binoculars and
sighting optics on tanks, by surface heat waves.
   _Damage to weapons, other vehicles and aircraft from the effects
of blowing sand and dust. The sand can grind down helicopter rotor
blades much like the effects of sandpaper on light metal. Sand also
can clog engines and air filters.
   _Transport of troops and supplies is more risky, particularly
over the great distances in the Saudi desert, because of a lack of
ground cover. That gives added importance to air power, and in turn
puts a greater onus on air defenses.
   Besides the dangers of exhaustion and dehydration, the heat also
hurts the U.S. troops' ability to cope with the threat of a
chemical attack by Iraq, according to military officers.
   The use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, but Iraq has admitted to using poison gas during its
eight-year war with Iran. Hundreds of civilians in an Iraqi village
that fell into Iranian hands were burned to death in an Iraqi gas
attack in 1988.
   The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Iraqi forces
appeared to have loaded gas munitions aboard combat aircraft. U.S.
officials would not confirm the report.
   ``It's a threat we're concerned with,'' Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Wednesday.
``The intelligence is somewhat ambiguous'' on whether the Iraqis
are preparing to use chemical weapons, he said.
   Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said the
soldiers heading to Saudi Arabia are equipped with gear to defend
against a chemical attack. This includes protective clothing, such
as boots, gloves, masks and special trousers and jackets, as well
as equipment for decontaminating clothing and gear.
   They also are carrying special sensing devices, including
battery-operated devices that sample the air for indications of
poisonous gas, as well as medicines to counteract the effects of
exposure to chemical agents, officials said.
   Padilla said all soldiers routinely are trained in chemical
protective measures, but most are exposed only to a simulated
chemical attack, not the real thing.
   ``It's something we train for on a regular basis,'' he said.
   The harsh climate combined with the vast, nearly featureless
open spaces of the Saudi desert presents extraordinary problems for
soldiers' ability to hide from the enemy.
   ``There's less area to camouflage yourself,'' said Maj. John
Wagstaffe of the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin,
Calif., in the Mojave Desert.

<TEXT>
   Here are some questions and answers about issues involved in the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Why did Iraq invade Kuwait?
   A. Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil
from wells along its disputed border with Iraq and of seeking to
wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. What has been world reaction?
   A. The U.N. Security Council on Monday ordered a worldwide
embargo on trade with Iraq. The 12-member European Economic
Community has imposed an embargo against imports of Kuwaiti and
Iraqi oil. It also banned exports of weapons to Iraq, suspended
that country's preferential trade status and froze Iraqi assets.
The United States has frozen both Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. What has been the reaction of the Arab states?
   The Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers met in Jiddah,
Saudi Arabia, denounced the invasion and called for Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait. The GCC consists of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman in a military and
economic pact.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was joined by King Hussein of
Jordan in proposing an Arab summit, set for Thursday in Cairo.
Countries expected to attend include: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Algeria, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya, Tunis,
Morocco, Jordan, and Oman.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Have other nations supported the United States?
   A. Yes. Britain will send unspecified naval and air force units
to join the multinational force. West Germany, Spain and Italy
agreed to let the United States use bases on their territory to
help transport U.S. troops and equipment sent to the Persian Gulf.
Turkey has shut down the Iraqi pipeline that runs through its
territory to the Mediterranean.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. How will the consumer in the United States be affected?
   A. It means higher gasoline prices, lines at gas pumps, higher
fuel oil prices, higher airline ticket prices. It can mean higher
utility bills, and it can also mean lost jobs.

<HEAD>KGB Says Train Explosion That Killed 5 was Caused by Embezzler's
Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB has determined that a bomb that killed
five people on a Moscow-bound passenger train last month was made
by a debt-ridden embezzler who may have wanted to fake his own
death, a newspaper reported.
   The KGB secret police identified the bomb-maker as Asker
Askerov, 34, who investigators believe was killed when the device
went off in his hands while he was drunk, the newspaper Rabochaya
Tribuna reported Wednesday.
   The story said not much was left of the corpse but forensic
tests led investigators to conclude that the body was Askerov's.
   A youth aged 10-12 who was traveling with Askerov was among the
five killed in the July 20 explosion, which also injured 12 people,
the newspaper said.
   The explosion occurred shortly after midnight between the second
and third cars of a train traveling on the Donetsk railway line in
southern Russia, just south of the Ukrainian border near the Sea of
Azov. The train had departed the day before from Tshkaltubo in the
republic of Georgia.
   Askerov, who had worked in a cooperative or private venture,
embezzled more than $636,000 and ran up huge debts, the newspaper
quoted two KGB investigators as saying.
   Askerov, of Naberezhniye Chelny, about 550 miles east of Moscow,
made the bomb himself in a hotel in the Russian town of Bataisk in
the northern Caucasus, according to the KGB investigators.
   As for motive, the newspaper quoted the investigators as saying
Askerov may have wanted to fake his own death to foil his
creditors, or he might have been planning to threaten them with the
bomb.
   Before the blast, passengers on the train recalled seeing a man
fitting Askerov's description walking through the cars, obviously
drunk and muttering that there would be an explosion, the newspaper
said.
   ``The bomb exploded in Askerov's hands when he was drunk,'' the
newspaper quoted the investigators as saying.

<HEAD>Producer Cancels Broadway Musical Over Union Ban on Actor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The producer of ``Miss Saigon'' has canceled the
Broadway musical rather than bow to an Actors' Equity demand that
he dump a white actor cast in the role of a Eurasian brothel owner.
   ``The debate is no longer about the casting of `Miss Saigon' but
the art of acting itself,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh said
Wednesday in announcing the London hit will not open in New York
next March.
   Equity, acting on a complaint from an Asian playwright and an
Asian actor, on Tuesday barred Englishman Jonathan Pryce from
re-creating in New York the role he originated in the show's London
version.
   The actors' union, which has veto power over foreign actors for
roles in the United States, said it turned down Pryce because ``the
casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an affront
to the Asian community.''
   Pryce said from London that he supports Mackintosh.
   ``What is appropriate is that the best person for the job play
the role and I think it's completely valid that I play the role,''
he said. ``If the character is half Asian and half European, you've
got to drop down on one side of the fence or the other, and I'm
choosing to drop down on the European side.''
   Mackintosh canceled despite $25 million in advance sales, the
largest in Broadway history. About $600,000 had already been spent
on the production, he said.
   ``The entire creative team and I do indeed feel totally defeated
artistically by this turn of events and in no way do we wish to
practice our art in the horrible atmosphere which has now been
created by Equity,'' Mackintosh said. ``Racial prejudice does seem
to have triumphed over creative freedom.''
   The controversy arose after Actors' Equity received complaints
from playwright David Henry Hwang and actor B.D. Wong about the
casting of Pryce.
   ``It has certainly never been my intention to see a show
canceled. I simply felt that an important point had to be made, and
this has clearly been achieved,'' Hwang, author of the Broadway hit
``M. Butterfly,'' said Wednesday.
   The economic fallout on Broadway from the cancellation could be
enormous.
   George Wachtel of the League of American Theaters and Producers
said a show the size and caliber of ``Miss Saigon'' could have
ticket sales in its first year of $30 million to $35 million.
   Salaries alone would be $200,000 a week, Wachtel said. The show
would have employed about 182 people, including 34 performers of
Asian descent. The musical is a love story set during the closing
days of the Vietnam War.
   Mackintosh declined to take the union ban to arbitration.
   ``I think Actors' Equity misjudged Cameron Mackintosh,'' said
Richard Maltby Jr., co-lyricist of the musical. ``They didn't
understand that if the show wasn't done to Cameron's standards,
he'd just as soon not have it done.''

   The government, which has already
banned smoking in most public areas, is moving its campaign to the
airways.
   The Health Ministry said Wednesday that smoking will be
prohibited on domestic airline flights of two hours or less.
   The ban affects flights between Brazil's major cities such as
Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia, the capital.
   The new rule will take effect after a public education campaign
by the airlines and the Department of Civilian Aviation, the
ministry said.
   It said it also was considering creating special shuttle flights
for smokers. Three months ago, the government approved a plan to
cut down on smoking in this country of 150 million people.
   The measures included a ban on cigarette sales to minors,
prohibition of cigarette ads on television between 6 a.m. and 9
p.m. and required health warnings on TV, newspaper and billboard
ads for cigarettes.
   About 55 million Brazilians are smokers. A law prohibiting
smoking in elevators, buses and public areas is routinely flouted.

<TEXT>
   The White House says it will give Congress a
formal notification of the deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi
Arabia under the War Powers Act, which limits American involvement
in foreign conflicts.
   A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Frank
Sieverts, said Wednesday that the panel was notified by the White
House that ``we will be given information that we will regard as
notification under the War Powers Act.''
   Administrations traditionally do not formally acknowledge the
act, which they regard as an unconstitutional infringement by
Congress on the president's powers as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces. Rather than tackle the issue head-on, however,
notification usually is given in a way that Congress regards as
compliance with the law.
   The act requires that the president consult with Congress
formally when U.S. forces are introduced ``into hostilities or into
situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly
indicated by the circumstances.'' Notification also is required
when combat-equipped troops are sent to the territory of any
foreign nation.
   The notification must include the president's explanation of why
the move is necessary and the estimated scope and duration of the
deployment.
   The law requires that the president terminate the military
deployment within 60 days unless Congress has specifically
authorized its continuation. The 60-day period can be extended to
90 days if the president certifies that such a move is ``an
unavoidable military necessity.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said while the deployment might not
meet the ``imminent hostilities'' test of the law, at least ``the
spirit'' of the act should be observed.

   The Magellan spacecraft accelerated
toward Venus today on a mission to make the most detailed pictures
yet of the cloud-shrouded planet's rugged surface.
   If all goes as planned, a computer program will order the
3.7-ton spaceship to fire its rocket Friday, slowing Magellan so it
will go into orbit around the second planet from the sun, NASA said.
   The $413 million Magellan, centerpiece of a $744 million
mission, was released from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989, then
launched by a booster rocket.
   Once Magellan is in orbit, engineers will test its radar and, if
necessary, fire the spacecraft's thrusters to adjust its path.
   During the week of Aug. 26, Magellan will begin using its radar
to peer through thick Venusian clouds to make pictures and maps of
the planet.
   The first pictures probably won't be released until September,
NASA said.

   From the moment that word flashed back to the
White House that Iraqi tanks were storming across the Kuwait
border, President Bush kept up a frenetic schedule orchestrating
the response of America and its allies.
   Aides say the president made the decision to send U.S. forces to
the Persian Gulf on Saturday, and orders were cut for the military
Sunday night.
   Bush got little sleep last Wednesday night as the invasion
unfolded in Kuwait.
   He met with his top generals and civilian advisers Thursday
morning in the Cabinet Room, denouncing Iraq's ``naked aggression''
and calling for its immediate withdrawal.
   Then he flew to Aspen, Colo., to confer with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and give a speech to the Aspen Institute
outlining plans to shrink the military by 25 percent _ 500,000
soldiers _ over the next five years.
   In a concession to the crisis, Bush canceled plans to spend the
night on the Rocky Mountain ranch of Henry Catto, the U.S.
ambassador to Britain, and instead flew back to Washington, getting
home after 2 a.m. Friday.
   He spent the weekend at Camp David, Md., meeting with national
security advisers Saturday to map his response to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   On Sunday morning, Bush was occupied with the evacuation of
Americans from the civil strife in Liberia. When he arrived back
from Camp David in mid-afternoon, he told reporters about his
telephone conversations with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and others.
   But he was testy, and one reporter who felt Bush's bite received
a handwritten note of apology from the president the next day.
   Bush met Sunday evening with his national security advisers, and
was on the phone repeatedly with foreign leaders _ at least 20
times to a dozen different presidents and prime ministers.
   He dispatched Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to the Middle East
to talk with Fahd, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Morocco's
King Hassan II. Bush himself spoke several times to Fahd and
Turkish President Turgut Ozal, through whose countries ran the
pipelines that carry 90 percent of Iraq's oil to market.
   On Monday, as the United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 to
impose stiff sanctions on Iraq, Bush was in the Oval Office with
Mrs. Thatcher and later with NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney flew in for dinner.
   On Tuesday, Bush briefed his Cabinet and headed off for two
hours to visit Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in nearby
Langley, Va. At one point he ducked out of the CIA briefings to
call Mulroney in Toronto to follow up their conversation from the
night before.
   Bush resolutely fended off reporters' questions as word filtered
out that American soldiers and warplanes were on their way to Saudi
Arabia.
   With his wife in Kennebunkport, Maine, with their grandchildren,
Bush invited national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and other
senior aides to dinner Tuesday night. It was a quiet, relaxed
affair, and the guests left Bush on his own by 9 p.m.
   He headed into the Oval Office by 6:40 a.m. Wednesday, tieless
and relaxed when a reporter encountered him as technicians readied
the cameras for his 9 a.m. address to the nation.
   If the president appeared somewhat tired and tongue-tied at his
subsequent news conference, it was not from working late Tuesday
but ``just the accumulation of things'' over the past week, an aide
said.
   By Wednesday afternoon, however, things had calmed down enough
for Bush to quit work early and head for the White House tennis
courts.

   When Rep. Jerry Costello's son wanted a break
from college, his parents never imagined he would join the Army.
   But nine months after he enlisted, Jerry F. Costello II is now a
paratrooper in the Middle East, his father says.
   ``I'm concerned for his safety and well-being,'' Costello,
D-Ill., said Wednesday. ``By the same token I'm very proud that he
chose to go in and defend his country.''
   Last November, after two years at Lincoln College, the younger
Costello, 21, joined the Army. He was assigned to the 82nd
Airborne, whose members were ordered to the Middle East to stop
Iraq.
   Costello and his wife, Georgia, called Fort Bragg, N.C., but no
information was released because of security concerns.
   ``Given the fact that there have been 5,000 soldiers from the
82nd Airborne deployed from Fort Bragg, there's no question in our
minds that he is either in Saudi Arabia or on the way there,''
Costello said.
   The parents saw their son over the weekend.
   ``He fully expected that if the aggression by the Iraqis
continued, and if there was a threat to Saudi Arabia, he would go.
Whenever we send ground troops in, normally the 82nd Airborne will
go in, either to secure airports or rescue hostages,'' Costello
said.
   He said his son's Army stint is rooted in a desire for public
service.
   ``One of the things he's always said since he was a little boy
was that everyone should have to serve their country in one form or
another. ... He believes there ought to be a draft,'' Costello said.
   Although his son is at risk, the father believes President Bush
made the right decision.
   ``It's in the interest of the American people,'' Costello said.
``I'm glad we have made a major commitment and not just sent a few
troops.''

<HEAD>Yeutter to Try to Fashion Farm Bill to Administration Wishes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Congress goes back to work next month,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says he'll be ready to work
with lawmakers on a final version of the 1990 farm bill.
   The House and Senate have each passed a version of the five-year
bill, but a conference committee will have to iron out differences.
And those will have to be acceptable to the Bush administration,
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   Probably the biggest obstacle will be adjusting farm program
benefits to fit within federal budget rules, which are still being
negotiated.
   There are other hurdles, too. Yeutter told reporters he wished
that Congress had ironed out many of the problems while the bills
were still in committees or when they came up for floor debate.
   Yeutter said he was hopeful Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman
of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, head of the House Agriculture Committee, would do some
streamlining when the bills go to conference.
   He said he hoped the two chairmen would be ``willing to jettison
undesirable provisions that may have been added for political
purposes'' during development of the House and Senate bills.
   Yeutter labeled as ``pure bunk, absolute political year
nonsense'' charges that he had shied away from the farm bill to
spend more time on Uruguay Round negotiations under the
international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``If there's anything that reflects demagoguery, those kind of
comments do,'' he said. ``We've been fully involved in that (farm
bill) process from the very first day.''
   Yeutter said the Agriculture Department sent Congress a ``green
book'' of more than 70 major recommendations on the farm bill and
had mailed 20,000 copies all over the country to promote the
administration's plan.
   Further, he said, two senior USDA officials were assigned
fulltime to the House and Senate as the farm bills developed.
   ``Some members of Congress wanted to have the secretary of
agriculture on site so that they could use him as a whipping boy in
the congressional debate,'' he said. ``We had sufficient
perspicacity to avoid that temptation.''
   Yeutter said he probably will spend much time on Capitol Hill
during the conference negotiations.
   ``This is crunch time in the farm bill, and I will certainly
make my personal views known to all the conferees as we proceed the
rest of the way,'' he said.
   Yeutter said the administration ``will obviously seek a number
of changes'' in the farm bill versions as they now stand. But he
declined to spell out what those would be.
   However, Yeutter said his earlier threats of a veto
recommendation to President Bush still stand if the 1990 farm bill
doesn't meet budget and market requirements. He did not elaborate
further.
   Yeutter's remarks were at a telephone news conference with farm
broadcasters and with reporters afterward. He was joined at the
USDA news conference by U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   Both officials decried recent moves by the European Economic
Community, or EEC, to step up export subsidies of agricultural
products.
   ``What the (EEC) has done recently is a good indication of what
they'll do if we don't get some disciplines negotiated in the
Uruguay Round'' of talks, Yeutter said.
   The negotiations, due to conclude at the end of this year,
include U.S. proposals for ending or phasing out trade-distorting
practices such as export subsidies.
   Yeutter said recent EEC subsidies on wheat shipments, for
example, are ``appalling'' and ``are higher than the value of the
underlying product.''
   ``We've again reached a situation where they can undersell us in
the world markets if we price our wheat at zero,'' he said.
   The EEC also has sharply boosted its export subsidies for some
other agricultural products, including dairy and beef, he said.
   Mrs. Hills said the EEC policies of high domestic farm supports,
which encourage surplus production, and huge export subsidies to
unload that surplus cannot continue.
   ``At some point that's going to cause the system to crash,'' she
said.
   Asked during the news conference what might happen if the
current round of GATT talks fail to gain the global trade
liberalization sought by the United States, Mrs. Hills said she was
``not prepared to speculate on failure.''
   Yeutter was leaving today for two weeks of meetings in the Far
East to talk about trade negotiations, the 1990 farm bill and other
agricultural matters of mutual interest.
   In Japan, Yeutter said he plans to give away packets of
industry-donated U.S. rice as a gesture to encourage relaxation of
Tokyo's ban on rice imports. He said this should be done if Japan
wants to have credibility as an advocate of world trade
liberalization.

<HEAD>Administration Trying to Put Best Face on Bailout Progress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after President Bush signed landmark
savings and loan bailout legislation, the administration is trying
to accentuate the positive about its handling of the
still-worsening mess.
   Anticipating a chorus of criticism around today's anniversary of
the bill, Bush's Cabinet officers are emphasizing the bailout's
benefits to depositors, minimizing the rising cost to taxpayers and
denouncing what they call the ``blame game'' played by
congressional Democrats.
   ``The staggering size of the cost estimates understandably
alarms taxpayers and frightens politicians into finger-pointing and
blame-avoiding. The line in the political world goes, `Since I
don't make mistakes, someone else must be making them,''' Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Wednesday.
   Overlooked in the furor, he said, is the fact that the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as it is
formally known, has so far protected 6.4 million deposit accounts
averaging around $10,000 each.
   ``Our job is to conduct the massive cleanup operation
effectively and responsibly, to rise above the political blame
game, and to work steadily and professionally to get the job
done,'' Brady said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and chief White House economic
adviser Michael Boskin also are defending the administration at
other events this week.
   But the record over the last year and the outlook for the next
is decidedly mixed.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created to handle the bailout, has
closed or sold 211 insolvent thrifts and plans to deal with 126
more this year.
   But that would leave it still running 135 collapsed thrifts and
looking ahead to an additional 230 to 550 failures among the
remaining 2,430 privately-run S&amp;Ls.
   Solvent S&amp;Ls lost $271 million in the first three months of 1990
even though they are under less pressure from insolvent
institutions desperately seeking deposits with high interest rates.
   The Justice Department established financial institution fraud
task forces in 27 cities and hired 118 assistant U.S. attorneys and
153 FBI agents. But complex fraud cases take years to prosecute and
it is too soon to tell if the added staff will make significant
headway against a backlog of 21,147 criminal referrals.
   The S&amp;L cleanup is far wider and its cost far deeper than
envisioned on Aug. 9, 1989, when Bush signed the law in a sunny
Rose Garden ceremony.
   ``If someone would have told me the day of the bill signing that
S&amp;Ls would be the No. 1 issue and the crisis would look even worse
than it did a year ago, I would have said, `You're crazy,''' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee. ``Yet, that's exactly where we are.''
   The cost of the bailout contributed to Bush's decision to
abandon his ``no new taxes'' pledge and led to the first serious
congressional push since Watergate to reform campaign finance laws.
   The bailout also threatens to spill into the general economy as
a credit crunch. Real estate developers and small businesses
already are complaining that they can't get loans. The Federal
Reserve Board has been forced to cut interest rates.
   Savings and loans, barely mentioned in the 1988 presidential
race, have become a prime issue in this year's congressional races.
Challengers view the issue as their best chance to defeat
incumbents, especially those who received political contributions
from the industry.
   Behind the firestorm is the need for more tax money to finance
the cleanup.
   The year-old act provided $50 billion to cover S&amp;L losses and
allowed regulators to raise additional cash by borrowing against
the sour loans, distressed real estate and other assets inherited
from the bankrupt thrifts.
   Now, regulators say they will need up to $100 billion for the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1. That includes $30 billion to $40
billion from taxpayers, with the rest to be borrowed and repaid
when assets of failed S&amp;Ls are sold.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House task force
monitoring the bailout, says taxpayers' liability won't be
contained until the Resolution Trust Corp. makes headway in selling
failed institutions' assets.
   The bailout agency last week announced its ``great fall
inventory clearance sale,'' which will use an international
satellite auction and other techniques to reduce its $165 billion
asset portfolio by $50 billion by Dec. 31.

   Did you hear the one about the stand-up comic who
got booked on a commuter flight? Had to sit down. Too much
turbulence.
   Passengers are getting comedy with their cabin service on
Continental Express flights from Detroit to Cleveland this week.
   ``If you don't like my act, where are you going to go?'' comic
Don Tersigni told his audience Wednesday aboard the 30-passenger
Flight 4454.
   Tersigni, who did Elvis Presley and Sylvester Stallone
impressions after lemonade and peanuts were passed out, said
afterward that it wasn't like entertaining the average nightclub
crowd.
   ``I couldn't hear myself, really, especially doing
impressions,'' he said, alighting from the noisy twin-turboprop.
   ``I was just sort of winging it,'' he added, starting to smile.
``I hope it will help my career, sort of, take off.''
   Comedian Al Aprill did a sit-down act when Flight 4454 ran into
turbulence Monday night.
   ``I was told our comedian does a real good job. I'm sorry I
can't let him stand up,'' Capt. Bill Daly said.
   Continental Express scheduled business briefings on morning
flights and comedy in the evening this week to pump up publicity
for its new Cleveland-Detroit route. The 50-minute flights are too
short for movies.
   Johnny Carson mentioned the gimmick on his ``Tonight Show,''
saying that anyone traveling to Detroit or Cleveland could use a
little comedy.
   ``It's different,'' said one passenger, William Stadler, a
Boston businessman. ``It wasn't boring, anyway.''
   Earlier Wednesday, most of the 17 passengers on a 7 a.m. flight
stayed awake to hear Detroit Free Press assistant business editor
Nunzio Lupo discuss labor negotiations between the Big Three
automakers and the United Auto Workers.
   Lupo stood, braced against the closed cockpit door, glanced at a
few note cards and delivered a 20-minute summation into a hand
microphone.
   Passengers applauded. Perhaps more important, they listened to
the airline's emergency instructions.
   ``In the morning it's really hard. They'll sleep, or read their
paper. They don't listen to my demo,'' said flight attendant Lisa
Lyons.
   Spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said Continental Express hadn't
decided whether to try such promotions on its other commuter
flights from Continental Airlines' hubs in Cleveland, Newark,
Houston and Denver.

   ``Ellington Express'' carried the audience at
Lincoln Center through an evening of three extended pieces by Duke
Ellington and six of the songs he wrote about trains _ all
brilliantly performed.
   Each of the train songs was from a different decade.
   Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center, knowing the Wednesday night
concert was special, will offer a rerun Thursday at Alice Tully
Hall.
   The high point of the first piece, the 1959, four-movement
``Toot Suite,'' was a long solo by tenor saxophonist Todd Williams
in ``Ready Go!'', the last movement. Williams, who is in Wynton
Marsalis' band, brought the audience to its feet in last year's
Ellington concert with ``Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.'' He
stands calmly, no grimacing, and escalates listeners' blood
pressure just with his steady, persistent playing.
   Marsalis played in the band and he was a revelation. As good as
one expects him to be, one doesn't expect so many styles to be done
to perfection. He went from sounding primitive and earthy in ``Red
Carpet'' from ``Toot Suite'' to a deep growl, contrasting with
Alvin Batiste's clarinet, in ``Bluebird of Delhi'' from the 1966
``Far East Suite,'' to a high, bright use of a metal hat mute in
``Happy-Go-Lucky Local.''
   Alto saxophonist Norris Turney's romantic ``Isfahan,'' with the
other instruments orchestrated to swirl around him, was another of
many special movements in the exotically beautiful ``Far East
Suite.''
   Act 2 started with the six train songs, from ``Choo Choo'' of
1924, when Ellington was 25, to ``Loco Madi,'' written at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1972.
   David Berger, who transcribed the evening's music from
recordings by the Ellington Band, conducted. For him, ``Day Break
Express'' from 1933 is ``the most dazzling of all Ellington's train
pieces.'' He said, ``It comes out of the night into the morning at
100 miles an hour.'' The band, which was wonderfully rehearsed,
fresh, full-bodied but never heavy, rushed ``Day Break Express''
past all depots.
   That was followed by ``Happy-Go-Lucky Local'' from 1946, from
which Jimmy Forrest ``appropriated'' the main melody for ``Night
Train.''
   Final piece on the program was ``Harlem,'' an evocative piece
with many mini-portraits and moods, obviously about a place that
Ellington loved. ``Harlem,'' a tone poem from 1950, has a triumphal
ending with high-note trumpets.
   The audience wouldn't let the band go so they played two
encores, ``Rockin' in Rhythm'' and ``Things Ain't What They Used To
Be.'' Ellington music sounds as good as it used to.

   During a meeting with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein two months ago, a group of U.S. senators were startled to
see the official interpreter rush into the room late, quivering in
fear.
   The translator had been held up briefly in an elevator, and the
meeting had been delayed by a few moments. ``The poor guy was
terrified. He looked like he was afraid he was going to die,'' said
one of those present.
   Fear and terror surround the 53-year-old Iraqi president, and
U.S. intelligence officials and other analysts believe that climate
could be his undoing.
   ``Everybody around him tells him what he wants to hear,'' said
one congressional source, who has concluded that Saddam's invasion
of Kuwait was a severe miscalculation based on poor information and
a failure to foresee the international fallout that would result.
   But the U.S. intelligence profile of Saddam also is of a
risk-taker who is not afraid to gamble against long odds. Concern
is heightened by the Arab leader's profile as one without respect
for common human values or the normal rules of diplomacy. Use of
chemical weapons, terrorism and hostage-taking all are
possibilities, they say.
   The picture of Saddam shows a man with a strange duality: tough,
yet fearful; inspiring fear in his own people, yet also basking in
a kind of populist veneration from many of the region's Arabs.
   The portrait is one of a poor orphan who rose to power through
opportunism and brutality, whose anti-Western views were shaped in
childhood, and who now _ commanding the world's fourth-largest army
_ is trying to deliver on his nationalist dreams.
   Saddam, say intelligence sources and Americans who have met with
him, is a ruler without finesse, but with keen political instincts
and well-defined goals.
   Foremost among those goals, the sources say, is to become the
``Nasser of the '90s,'' the dominant figure in the Arab world and
the chief controller of OPEC oil.
   Driving Saddam is a devotion to Arab political and cultural
supremacy and a deep-seated hatred for Israel and for any Western
infringement of his independence _ particularly from the United
States and Great Britain, the two countries that have publicly
committed troops to Saudi Arabia's defense.
   But while jealously guarding Arab independence, Saddam also
covets Western technology and education and has sought to modernize
his country. He has been able to work well with the French, who
have supplied many of the weapons that are the basis of Iraq's
military might.
   The son of peasants who was orphaned at an early age, Saddam
grew up with an uncle in the Iraqi town of Takrit, which was known
as a hotbed of ferment against the British rule of Iraq. His uncle
was arrested for participating in an uprising against the
government.
   He later joined the Arab Baath socialist party and became
devoted to the cause of ridding his country of foreign influences.
His rise to power has been facilitated by execution of his
opponents, and he has used chemical weapons against Iran and
against his own Kurdish minority.
   There is strong evidence that Saddam personally shot to death
one of his cabinet ministers in 1982 after the official said aloud
at a cabinet meeting that the invasion of Iran had been a mistake.
   Unlike leaders of other Moslem countries, Saddam appears to be a
purely secular head of state. ``He doesn't seem to value human
life, or to have any moral standards,'' said one congressional
source who has met with Saddam.
   ``He has got certain views that don't appear much amenable to a
lot of negotiation. You didn't come out thinking, `we can probably
work out a deal,''' the source said.
   Saddam frequently states his conviction that there is a
conspiracy among Israel, the United States and Britain to topple
him, and visitors are left with the impression of someone who is
insecure. Saddam, who has been the target of assassination
attempts, surrounds himself with military bodyguards.
   He wore a gun during a meeting with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
in January, an aide to the senator said.
   He relies on terror to maintain his power. He is often compared
to Adolf Hitler, and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David
Boren, D-Okla., called the Iraqi security apparatus ``the most
effective internal police state in the world.''
   Iraqi citizens are afraid to speak their ruler's name, said
Boren, for fear it will be misunderstood as criticism, an offense
that is punishable by execution.
   ``His sense of face and dignity is extremely important,'' said
another U.S. analyst. ``He governs by ruthlessness and fear and
awe. If he is thought to lose face, that's losing a good half of
his capacity.''
   Intelligence sources said Saddam saw in the conquest of Kuwait a
chance to meet several needs and tried to calculate the risks
before moving ahead. He wanted to gain greater access to the
Persian Gulf, to gain new wealth to offset his country's debt from
its eight-year war with Iran, and to punish what many Arabs see as
Kuwaiti arrogance.
   But analysts said he probably had no idea that his invasion of
Kuwait would bring the broad condemnation, trade sanctions and
military response that have resulted.
   Saddam is limited in his ambitions only by threats to his own
power at home, say U.S. analysts.
   ``He goes for the jugular on power,'' said one government
analyst. ``He understands how to get it, how to wield it and how to
keep it.''

   In a gesture to a ``friendly and important
customer,'' Mexico will send an additional 100,000 barrels of oil a
day to the United States to help ease shortages caused by the
embargo imposed against Iraq and Kuwait.
   The Mexican commitment, scheduled to last two months, is
expected to restore about 15 percent of the more than 700,000
barrels a day the United States is no longer receiving as a result
of the embargo.
   The Mexican decision was announced Wednesday by Foreign
Secretary Fernando Solana, who headed his country's delegation to a
daylong meeting of Mexican and American officials convened to
discuss cross-border issues.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela also announced plans Wednesday to
increase oil production.
   While the Mexican move could ease concerns about domestic
supplies in this country, it also will provide added cash to
Mexico, with a bonus resulting from the higher prices caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady praised the Mexican action,
saying it ``exemplifies the spirit of relations between the two
countries.''
   ``This aid by Mexico is much appreciated at this time,'' Brady
said. Solana said he felt it was necessary to meet the needs of
``an important and friendly customer.''
   Total U.S. oil imports average an estimated 4 million barrels a
day. Solana indicated that the Mexican increase would have been
higher but that oil production in Mexico is running virtually at
capacity.
   Mexico exports about half of its 2.5 million barrel daily
production of oil.
   More than 70 Mexican officials accompanied Solana for
Wednesday's meeting, which was held under the auspices of the
U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission. All told, more than 150
delegates from the two countries took part in the discussions,
which are held annually and touch on a broad range of cross-border
issues.
   The meetings took place against a background of unusual harmony
in Mexican-American relations.
   At the ceremonial opening session, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III joined with Solana in denouncing the Iraqi conquest of
Kuwait and in calling from the withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
   Baker had been scheduled to devote a full day to the commission
deliberations but left in late morning for Turkey to deal with the
Persian Gulf crisis.

   Vice President Dan Quayle concludes his

``zero'' intention of involving its military forces in operations
against the cocaine trade.
   ``Let no one say ... that there are military operations by the
United States of America in this effort,'' Quayle told a news
conference Wednesday night. ``The United States has no intention of
... (undertaking) military operations. Zero.''
   Latin American sensitivity on that point drew the question of
military involvement repeatedly as Quayle visited Bogota, Colombia;
Lima, Peru, then La Paz. He got a public welcome there, his first
after the rigorous security that surrounded him in the other two
Andean capitals, both plagued by violence.
   Crowds lined the La Paz streets to see him, and applauded him as
he stepped from his limousine for conferences with President Jaime
Paz Zamora and other Bolivian officials.
   Quayle was flying on to Santa Cruz, Bolivia's second city, for a
refueling stop and a conference with Gen. Hugo Banzer, a former
military dictator who now shares power with Paz Zamora, himself a
former Marxist once jailed for attempting to overthrow Banzer.
   After a final drug conference, with U.S. drug enforcement and
aid officials working in Bolivia, Quayle was flying to Haiti later
today to urge support for the fledgling electoral process that is
supposed to produce that nation's first free elections on Nov. 4.
He returns to Washington tonight.

<HEAD>Bar Association Drops Pro-Choice Stand on Abortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Abortion rights advocates are not giving up their
fight to put the American Bar Association back on record in favor
of a pro-choice stand on abortion despite a setback from the
nation's largest lawyers' organization.
   ``Time is on our side,'' said Estelle Rogers of Washington,
D.C., a leader of the defeated abortion rights forces. She said
that as more women become lawyers and join the ABA, they may
persuade the organization to reinstate a pro-choice policy.
   The lawyers, deeply split over the issue, headed home from their
annual summer convention after the ABA's policy-making House of
Delegates on Wednesday reversed a 6-month-old policy in support of
abortion rights.
   The delegates adopted the policy in February by a margin of more
than two-to-one but repealed it on Wednesday by a vote of 200-188.
   A resolution favoring neutrality on abortion was approved by a
coalition of attorneys either opposed to abortion or who believed
the association tarnished its reputation by going on record in
support of such a controversial position.
   Abortion rights supporters said they are not discouraged, noting
that about 90 percent of the delegates were men.
   They said male dominance is bound to erode as more women join
the ABA.
   ``Nobody here has the illusion we're going to put our tails
between our legs and go home,'' Ms. Rogers told reporters.
   During nearly two hours of debate, Sally Determan of Washington,
D.C., said the repeal measure sends a message that the ABA is
abandoning its support of ``women's right to choose, to control our
own bodies.''
   But Barbara Howard of Cincinnati, Ohio, said she supported
repeal because views on abortion are deeply held individual
religious and moral convictions.
   ``Abortion is not a legal issue. It's a political issue, a moral
issue,'' she said.
   The House of Delegates repealed its abortion rights stand at the
urging of a larger group of lawyers, the ABA Assembly, who voted
885-836 on Monday in favor of neutrality.
   It is uncertain when the next fight over the issue may occur,
but the 360,000-member organization holds conventions every six
months and some officials said sooner or later there is bound to be
another clash.
   The ABA's new president, John J. Curtin Jr. of Boston, held a
joint news conference after Wednesday's vote with his designated
successor, Sandy D'Alemberte of Tallahassee, Fla., to stress the
need for healing wounds.
   The two men are on opposite sides of the issue. Curtin urged
repeal of the abortion rights stand. D'Alemberte pleaded with his
colleagues to stand fast behind the pro-choice policy, calling it
an endorsement of ``the principle of liberty.''
   Both men said ABA members should stay in the organization and
hash out their differences on the issue. More than 1,500 quit in
protest after the pro-choice policy was adopted in February.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady says
soaring oil prices need not topple the United States into a
recession, but private analysts warn that the shock endangers an
already weak economy.
   ``We are not contemplating recession,'' Brady said Wednesday at
the National Press Club.
   ``Certainly the events of last week, where the price of oil has
gone up, are going to impose additional hardships on the country,''
he said. ``But I don't think we should come to judgment quickly.''
   The price of crude oil soared from $20 a barrel last week,
before Iraq invaded Kuwait, to $25.96 on Wednesday. Brady said
increasing production outside the region will eventually help
offset a break in oil supplies from the Persian Gulf.
   ``Before we wring our hands and hang our heads about the price
of oil, we should remember the system adjusts,'' he said.
   However, the chief economist of the influential U.S. Chamber of
Commerce declared that the nation will be unable to avoid a
recession later this year even if the explosive situation in the
Persian Gulf eases soon.
   ``We anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually
contract by 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter,'' Richard W. Rahn
told a news conference.
   ``Our forecast shows the economy continuing to experience
negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and practically
no growth in the second quarter,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that economic
growth was slackening even before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   In a July 27 survey of the Fed's 12 district banks, ``most noted
that the pace was slow or had slackened recently,'' the central
bank said in a report known as the Beige Book.
   Rahn blamed the softness on what he views as the Fed's misguided
tight-money policy, aimed at controlling inflation.
   Brady said he and President Bush want the Federal Reserve to
give economic growth a boost by lowering interest rates.
   The Treasury secretary said strong growth was particularly
important now, as the United States responds to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``Everybody wants lower interest rates. ... At this point in
time in the United States, economic growth is very important,'' he
said.
   Brady expressed confidence that Federal Reserve policy-makers,
who meet on Aug. 21, would lower rates in response to sluggish
growth. The economy, as measured by the gross national product,
grew at an anemic 1.5 percent annual rate in the first half of 1990.
   ``The fact that the country is faced with slower growth will
almost certainly produce lower interest rates,'' Brady said.
   Reducing the federal budget deficit also becomes more important
as the United States tries to exert its influence in the Persian
Gulf, he said.
   Private economists, however, contend that large spending cuts or
tax increases would threaten a shaky economy and Brady conceded
that deficit negotiations with Congress may produce a reduction
other than the stated $50 billion goal.
   Brady also said he did not know if oil companies were taking
advantage of consumers by raising gasoline prices so quickly after
the invasion of Kuwait, But, he said, ``If people are gouging ...
those that are doing the gouging will hear from the president.''

   Iraq's battle-hardened, 1 million-man
army, powerful air force, and store of missiles and chemical
weapons are the mightiest in the Arab world.
   Although Iraq is outgunned by the air and sea power of U.S.
forces now being ranged against it, President Saddam Hussein can
count on disciplined phalanxes fresh from the 8-year war with Iran
and held in rein by fear.
   Saddam has repeatedly purged the officer corps since he rose to
power in the mid-1970s, subordinating the armed forces to the
ruling Baath party.
   If they were lucky, officers that didn't fall in line were
simply retired. But many were executed, sometimes on trumped-up
charges as an example to the others, Iraqi exiles have said.
   Iraqi author Samir al-Khalil wrote that in once instance Saddam
drew his pistol and, before several other officers, shot a
commander who made a ``tactical retreat'' because he didn't have
the heart to order his forces to mow down an Iranian human-wave
attack.
   There were constant reports during the war with Iran that morale
in the ranks was flagging, not surprising in view of the
battlefield standstill that set in after Iraq's initial victories
early in the fighting.
   But none of them translated into mass desertions or major
challenges to Saddam's rule, and the army remains its most powerful
bastion along with the ruling party.
   By Middle East standards, Iraq's forces have an awesome armory,
comparable only with Israel's.
   Before the latest crisis he had an army of 955,000, with another
45,000 in the navy and air force. Since invading Kuwait on
Thursday, Saddam has announced the creation of new army divisions
that could add at least 100,000 troops.
   Iraq's army has 5,500 battle tanks, 7,100 armored personnel
carriers and 3,000 towed artillery pieces, according to the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Iraq's 40,000-man air force flies 513 combat aircraft, mainly
Soviet-made MiGs and French Mirages, including some armed with
anti-ship Exocet missiles.
   In the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam's air force devastated Iran's oil
production facilities and shipping. It was a French-made Exocet
that crippled the U.S. frigate USS Stark, killing 37 American
sailors in an attack Iraq said was a mistake.
   American officers who observed skirmishes during the Iran-Iraq
war judged Iraqi pilots to be skillful but so wary of anti-aircraft
defenses around Iran's big Kharg Island oil terminal that they
often launched their missiles from maximum range of about 40 miles.
This, the officers said, burned most of the missiles' fuel and
effectively reduced their explosive power on impact.
   Saddam's arsenal has been bolstered by a recent buildup of
sophisticated missiles, some capable of carrying chemical weapons,
which Iraq used against Iran and also against its own rebellious
Kurdish minority, killing thousands.
   In attacks on Iranian cities, Iraq used its Al Hussein missile,
which has a 400-mile range. Iraq says it has now developed missiles
with a 750-mile range.
   Iraq announced in December that it had launched a 48-ton,
three-stage rocket capable of putting a satellite into space and
had test-fired two surface-to-surface missiles with a range of
2,140 miles.
   Western intelligence sources confirmed the rocket launch, but
said it was less successful than at first believed. They said the
rocket only flew for two minutes, reaching an altitude of 12{ miles
before plunging to earth.
   Nonetheless, some analysts believe it put Iraq on the threshold
of ballistic missile capability.
   More fears about Saddam's military buildup were aroused earlier
this year when British authorities intercepted a shipment to Iraq
of what Western experts said were nuclear-bomb triggers.
   British customs officers also stopped shipments to Iraq of huge
steel pipes that were described as parts of a giant ``super gun''
capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells several hundred miles.
   But analysts say Iraq is still years away from a nuclear
capability.
   Amid growing concern in Israel and the West over his growing
arsenal, Saddam in May threatened to destroy half of Israel with
chemical weapons in the event of any Israeli attack.
   He proudly announced that Iraq had manufactured advanced binary
chemical weapons _ the type that the United States has recently
been destroying as it reduces its forces in the post-Cold War era.
   After last week's invasion, Iraq threatened to ``turn Kuwait
into a graveyard'' if any outside force were to intervene.
   By comparison with the rest of his arsenal, Saddam's navy is
puny. Most of it was sunk by Iranian warplanes and artillery early
in the war, clogging up the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   The Shatt-al-Arab was Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf _
until its conquest of Kuwait.
   The Iraqis have five frigates and 38 patrol ships, no match
against the fleet of U.S. warships _ including three aircraft
carriers _ being deployed in the region.

   Brigitte Bardot is demanding that Japan return a
chimpanzee that a French zoo traded to a Japanese research
institute for 10 monkeys.
   The former film star said during a meeting with Japanese
Ambassador Akitani Kiuchi that the 10-year-old chimpanzee named
Chloe was living ``worse than badly, in a frozen universe'' at the
University of Kyoto's Primate Research Institute.
   Chloe was traded along with an orangutan by the Zoo de Vincennes
in Paris for 10 macaque monkeys in 1984. The orangutan died earlier
this year in a concrete cage, Ms. Bardot's Society for the
Protection of Animals claimed.
   ``Chloe is in a basement, lacking sunlight, space, contact and
especially lacks affection, like all laboratory subjects,'' it said
in a statement. The type of research was not specified.
   The Japanese government will investigate Ms. Bardot's claims, a
spokesman said. But he noted that the animal trade was made between
private institutions.
   Ms. Bardot, 55, who rose to world fame in the 1956 movie ``And
God Created Women,'' gave up her film career in 1973 and has since
worked to protect animals.

   Jessica Tandy had a chauffeur in ``Driving
Miss Daisy.'' Getting a driver in real life may be a little harder
for the actress.
   Miss Tandy, 81, and her husband, actor Hume Cronyn, 79, wanted
to build an apartment above their detached, three-car garage in
case they find it necessary to hire domestic help, Cronyn said in a
zoning application.
   But town zoning regulations require accessory apartments to be
built in an existing house or adjacent to it, and the application
was rejected.
   ``We can't afford to await an immediate crisis before making
arrangements for the inevitable day when we must have someone on
the premises who can drive a car and give us a hand in the house,''
Cronyn said in the application.
   Cronyn said his wife has heart trouble. He said he lost one eye
to cancer and has a cataract in the other eye.
   Miss Tandy won a best actress Oscar earlier this year for her
portrayal of an elderly widow in ``Driving Miss Daisy.''

   A spokesman for Geraldo Rivera says a TV station
caved in to a Fort Worth mother of two in dropping his afternoon
talk show.
   ``It's certainly not a surprise, because the station has made
several announcements over the past few months that it intended to
drop the show because of pressure being brought to bear by one
viewer,'' said Jeff Erdel.
   But Joe Bell, program manager for KDFW-TV, said a drop in
ratings was the main reason ``Geraldo'' was not renewed.
   Lynda Beams has campaigned for nearly three years to have the
syndicated show moved from its after-school time slot, complaining
the program was unsuitable for children because it sometimes dealt
with sex and violence.
   Her petition drive forced some sponsors to withdraw support for
the show.
   Erdel on Wednesday said ``Geraldo'' has changed since December
to become ``the cleanest, most wholesome talk show on television.''
   ``The `Geraldo' shows have focused on such issues as education,
child welfare, gun control and very relevant social issues, leaving
the subjects of necrophilia and other sexual perversions to the
other talk shows,'' he said.

   Sheriff's deputies went to W. Axl

lead singer was playing his stereo too loudly at night.
   That much is clear, but what happened next is in contention.
   Deputy George Ducoulombier, a Sheriff's Department spokesman,
said several officers turned up at Rose's door shortly after
midnight on Aug. 1, asked him to turn down the music and left.
   But Rose said about 13 officers with nightsticks tried to get
in. The officers tried to provoke him and threatened to bring him
down to the station, he said in a complaint filed with the
department.
   ``As there was no cause or warrant to enter his home, Axl is
left with the conclusion that this was an act of heavy-handed
intimidation and a substantial violation of his civil rights,'' he
said in a statement.

   Twenty years ago, Saudi Arabia depended
on the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca for a significant portion
of its revenue.
   The unprecedented oil wealth accumulated since then has helped
it build a modern state and army. But balancing traditional Islamic
political and social laws with the dizzying speed of development
has always made the royal family feel vulnerable.
   The name ``Saudi Arabia'' is almost synonymous with oil. The
estimated 255 billion barrels of oil lying beneath its deserts
represent a quarter of known world reserves.
   The jump in prices in the 1970s from a few dollars to more than
$40 per barrel brought staggering wealth. Saudi citizens are
believed to have $200 billion in Western banks. The government has
about $70 billion in financial reserves, down from $130 billion a
decade ago due to low oil prices in the late 1980s.
   Spending has been prolific, with the annual budgets at about $35
billion. Defense spending in the projected 1990 budget was $13.8
billion, about 40 percent of the total. The Al-Saud rulers spent
just $100 million on defense in 1971, fearful of spawning a
competing power.
   The vast growth in the neighboring armed forces of Iraq, Iran
and Israel, as well as the value of the oil reserves, changed that
attitude.
   ``We are a very appealing piece of cake,'' former oil minister
Ahmed Zaki Yamani once said.
   Geographically, Saudi Arabia is a massive desert except for the
mountainous areas near the Red Sea. At roughly 873,000 square
miles, it is about one-third the size of the United States.
   No formal census statistics exist. But the population is
estimated at about 14 million, with more than 4.5 million
foreigners.
   The local populaton is overwhelming Sunni Moslem. There is a
Shiite minority in the eastern oil-producing province, often
suspected of harboring sympathies for the Islamic revolution in
largely Shiite Iran.
   Islam pervades the social, political, legal and cultural system
of Saudi Arabia. It was shaped by Wahhabism, named after an
18th-century puritan. He sought to maintain Islam as it existed
when the Prophet Mohammed founded the faith in Mecca in the 7th
century.
   Women and men are strictly separated in public. Women are
veiled, have a separate education system and are not allowed to
drive.
   The modern state dates only to 1932, when the king known in the
West as Ibn Saud unified a collection of tribal provinces. The
tribe numbers about 4,000 princes. The few hundred directly
involved in running the country control all significant posts.
   King Fahd is head of state, commander of chief of the armed
forces and prime minister. His crown prince is his half-brother
Prince Abdullah, head of the national guard.
   Next in line is Defense Minister Prince Sultan, a full brother
of Fahd. Interior Minister Prince Naif is a full brother as is the
governor of Riyadh, Prince Salman.
   All nine provincial governors are royals.
   Other prominent family members include Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Feisal, a son of the late King Feisal and nephew to Fahd.
The ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, is
son of the defense minister.
   Differences rarely spill into public, unless on the scale of the
early 1960s fight to get the incompetent King Saud off the throne.
   Decision-making is done by consulting the princes and other
powerful tribes. Each leader confers with the people through a
majlis, or audiences that any Saudi male has the right to attend.
   The system builds consensus but is painfully slow. Thus the
Saudi government has long relied on the United States to provide
backup to its 60,000-man army in times of crisis.
   Thousands of U.S. military advisers live in Saudi Arabia to help
with training.
   Saudi Arabia helped insulate the world economy from major oil
supply interruptions by increasing production at crisis periods
such as the 1979 revolution in Iran.
   But U.S.-Saudi relations have been rocky due to strong
Israeli-American ties.
   The Saudi Arabian king's most prestigious title is ``Guardian of
the Two Holy Cities,'' Mecca and Medina. The treasury once depended
totally on what Moslem pilgrims spent on their annual visit.
   As long as the third holiest city, Jerusalem, remains under
Israeli control, detractors like Iran can challenge the Al-Saud
role as guardians of the faith.
   Saudi Arabia has always avoided allowing U.S. forces openly into
the country out of fear their presence would help an internal
opposition jell.
   An air base near Dhahran was closed in 1962.
   The United States has been sensitive to the need for Saudi
Arabia to keep its distance.
   ``We must continue to recognize that preserving Saudi Arabia's
own stability requires the government to maintain a posture of
independence,'' Secretary of State Alexander Haig said during one
of the bruising congressional battles Saudi Arabia went through to
acquire sophisticated U.S. weapons. The Israeli lobby in Congress
always sought to block the sales.

<DATELINE>ROCKPORT, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution has agreed
not to interfere with this seaside town's plan to use a $1 million
bequest to convert an old school into a public library.
   The dispute was over the will of Franz Denghausen, a sculptor
and poet who lived in Rockport for 36 years. He died childless in
1987 and left $1 million to the town to replace the
turn-of-the-century Carnegie Library. The Smithsonian gets at least
$3 million more from Denghausen's estate.
   Ambiguous wording of one phrase in the will had led the
Smithsonian to argue that the town had to spend its own money for
the renovations and use the bequest only for operating and
maintaining the new library.
   The Smithsonian on Friday agreed to drop its challenge.
   ``This is really a terrific resolution to what was a thorny and
complex problem,'' said Attorney General James Shannon, whose
office supported Rockport's position and tried to settle the
dispute.
   Because Rockport cannot afford the renovations without the
bequest, the $1 million would have gone to the Smithsonian if the
museum had prevailed, Shannon said.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs said the museum simply
wanted good relations with the town. ``It was just getting to be a
very, very unhappy story,'' she said.
   Jacobs said the Smithsonian had received about 40 letters
criticizing its position. ``We were greatly distressed that our
motives were misinterpreted,'' she said.

   Jim Wells is used to snickers over his
boots for bovines, but he doesn't care so long as dairy farmers
keep snatching them up.
   ``That's everybody's first reaction. It's comical to see a cow
wearing a boot,'' said Wells. ``They come over, make a joke about
it, then ask what the boot is for. Then I've got them.''
   The clothing store owner introduced his Shoes for Moos a year
ago in eight countries, including Canada, the Soviet Union and
Japan.
   Since then, he has sold more than 15,000 of the boots at $50
apiece to help the hooves of dairy cows heal from corns, ulcers,
hoof rot and other infections.
   Paul Larkin, a dairy farmer from Hamilton, grinned as he looked
over the boot recently at a farm trade show in Seneca Falls. He
walked away with one under his arm.
   ``It's bad news when you have a cow with hoof rot or some other
kind of foot infection. I'm always looking for the better way and
this looked like one,'' Larkin said.
   The boot is a shorter version of a firefighter's boot. It's made
of fabric-backed rubber with two bright yellow straps and buckles.
It has a pebble-textured bottom for traction.
   Usually, when a cow develops hoof trouble, the animal is given
antibiotics and the foot is bandaged and wrapped in plastic bags to
keep the dressing dry.
   ``Plastic bags, as you can imagine, aren't the best fit. Cows
will rub them, chew at them or whatever until they come off,''
Wells said. ``They can't do that with the boot.''
   Some farmers use old galoshes, but they wear out easily. Others
use disposable diapers.
   There are 2{ million dairy cows in Canada and 11 million in the
United States. Capturing just 1 percent of the market would mean
sales of $6.5 million.
   ``Three years ago, I didn't know a thing about cows. But a
couple of Mennonite farmers came into my store and bought rubber
boots for their cows,'' he said. ``After talking to them, I
realized there was an untapped niche there.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Religious Group to Distribute Correction to Pamphlet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative religious group that cropped
pictures of an artist's work to suggest that it was sexually
explicit has been ordered by a federal judge to distribute a
correction to the pamphlet.
   The American Family Association of Tupelo, Miss., had reprinted
fragments of images by David A. Wojnarowicz to promote the
organization's contention that the National Endowment for the Arts
supports pornography.
   The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William C. Conner
came in a lawsuit by Wojnarowicz. The judge said the pamphlet had
probably harmed the artist's professional and personal reputation.
   Conner barred further publication of the pamphlet, ``Your Tax
Dollars Helped Pay for These Works of Arts.''
   He also awarded $1 in damages to Wojnarowicz, who had sought up
to $1 million. He said Wojnarowicz had not proved financial damage
because no galleries or museums had canceled exhibits of his work.
   Conner said the Amercan Family Association must send a
court-approved correction to the 4,000 churches, members of
Congress and other individuals who received the pamphlet.
   The association and its executive director, the Rev. Donald
Wildmon, have for years led campaigns against films, music, TV
shows, magazines and art that they deem obscene.
   Wildmon had objected to several of Wojnarowicz's works exhibited
this year at the Illinois State University Galleries. A catalog of
reproductions of 60 of his paintings, collages and photographs was
partly financed by the NEA.
   Wildmon's son, Tim, said the association had not decided whether
to appeal.

   A national security aide to George Bush when
he was vice president has testified before a federal grand jury
conducting a criminal investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   G. Philip Hughes, who has been nominated by President Bush to be
U.S. ambassador to Barbados, declined to discuss his testimony
Wednesday after being questioned by Iran-Contra prosecutors in
front of the grand jury empaneled at the U.S. Courthouse.
   Hughes until recently was the National Security Council's
executive secretary. He was deputy assistant for national security
affairs to Bush from 1981 to 1985.
   In 1985 and 1986, Hughes met periodically with North when Hughes
was the National Security Council's director for Latin American
affairs. At the time, North was running a secret network to
resupply the Nicaraguan Contras. The network operated during a
two-year congressional ban on U.S. military to the rebel force.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the Iran-Contra prosecutor's
office, declined to make any comment on Hughes' grand jury
appearance.

   Crosman Products is recalling nearly 53,000
air rifles that may have a defective trigger mechanism.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday the
company is recalling its Model 3100 air rifle, which has been sold
nationally since July 1986 and may contain an improperly hardened
sear in its trigger.
   If the sear is not properly hardened, it may wear prematurely
and the consumer may not be able to cock the airgun, the commission
said. If the gun is cocked with a defective sear, it could
discharge without the trigger being pulled _ even if the safety
mechanism is engaged.
   Consumers who own Crosman Model 3100 air rifles should
discontinue use and call the company toll free at 1-800-836-3100
for instructions. The line is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EDT,
Monday through Friday.
   The East Bloomfield, N.Y., company will inspect all returned
rifles, replace defective sears and return the airguns at no charge.

<HEAD>Study: Many Americans Can't Afford Necessities After Housing Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third of Americans spend so much for housing
they can't afford other necessities of life, according to a new
study.
   The report issued Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute, a
liberal economic research organization, said 27 million households
``are unable to meet their non-shelter needs at even a minimum
level of adequacy'' because of high housing costs.
   Those households contain 78 million people, or 32 percent of the
population, the organization said.
   The study said 42 percent of all who rent their homes were
``shelter poor'' in 1987, the last year of the study. Twenty-two
percent of homeowners were in that category, it said.
   The study's author, Michael E. Stone, professor of community
planning at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, used an
index that assumes a family pays its rent or mortgage first, then
uses what income is left to pay for basic needs such as food,
clothing, transportation and medical care.
   He concludes that people are ``shelter poor'' if their household
has too little left after paying the housing costs to afford the
minimum basic necessities, as defined by the federal government's
bureau of labor statistics low budget standards.
   His report contends that growth in one and two-person households
since 1970 has concealed an increase in housing affordability
problems experienced by families with children.
   The ``shelter poverty'' rate for one and two-person households
declined from 32 percent to 26 percent during the period, while the
rate for households with three or more people rose from 29 percent
to 34 percent.
   The problem is worst among the poorest one-third of households,
but also affects some middle-income households, particularly
renters, the study said.
   The study said the average ``shelter poor'' household faced a
gap of $290 a month between what they were paying and could afford
for housing.

   The FBI says it has settled a lawsuit filed
against it by a black agent who complained he had been a victim of
racial discrimination.
   The FBI statement announcing the agreement Wednesday did not
give details, including whether any payment was made to Donald
Rochon, a special agent who sued over alleged discrimination
against him in the bureau's Chicago office.
   In January the FBI settled racial discrimination complaints by
two other employees, Leadell Lee, a Chicago agent, and Gertie
Armstrong, a clerk in Omaha.
   Rochon's suit in U.S. District Court in Washington alleged he
was the butt of racial jokes and death threats in the Chicago
office.
   Rochon also had worked in Omaha and complained of racial
harassment there. That complaint was upheld in administrative
proceedings and was not part of the lawsuit.
   Rochon had been assigned to the Philadelphia office, but the FBI
statement said part of the settlement provided that he ``will not
return to active duty with the FBI.''

   An electronics company and two executives
have been indicted on charges of falsely certifying the quality of
parts for the space shuttle and numerous weapons.
   Impala Electronics Inc. was charged by a federal grand jury
Wednesday along with Joseph A. Pistone, owner and president, and
James Wilson, sales manager. Both live in Tampa.
   Government officials said there is no indication of safety
problems caused by the alleged scheme.
   Impala parts are in the shuttle's main engines, MX missiles,
B1-B bombers, Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles and components of the
``Star Wars'' anti-missile program.
   According to the indictment, low-quality resistors were falsely
marked as superior in reliability and other qualities. In addition,
the resistors allegedly were designated as newer than they actually
were.
   Resistors are small components that control current in an
electrical circuit.
   Impala was charged with operating a criminal enterprise, filing
false statements with government agencies and conspiring since 1971
to defraud the government. If convicted, the company could be fined
$4 million.
   Impala's telephones have been disconnected and officials could
not be reached for comment.
   Pistone, 47, could get up to 110 years in prison and $4.75
million in fines. Wilson, 46, faces up to 75 years in prison.
   The indictment stemmed from a yearlong investigation prompted by
a tip to the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Researchers Believe Tiny Skull Oldest Mammal on Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists claim to have found a tiny
skull of a shrew-like mammal that lived 10 million years before the
oldest mammal on record.
   A team of paleontologists from the New Mexico Museum of Natural
History found the fossil near Lubbock, Texas.
   ``What we've done is pushed back the record of mammals worldwide
by 10 million years,'' said Spencer Lucas, curator of paleontology
at the Albuquerque museum and head of the team.
   Scientists hope the fossil, which is smaller than a dime, will
be an important link in the evolutionary chain between reptiles and
mammals.
   The skull apparently belonged to a shrew-like animal with some
features common to reptiles and mammals and is 220 million years
old, Lucas said.
   That's 10 million years older than the Morganucodon, a British
fossil believed to be that of the oldest mammal in the world, and
25 million years older than the previously oldest mammal fossil
found in North America.
   ``Ten years from now, this mammal will be included in man's
understanding of the origin of mammals ... and the history of
life,'' Lucas said.
   University of Chicago professor James Hopson, considered an
authority on the link between reptiles and mammals, saw the fossil
at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and said it
probably belongs to the oldest known mammal.
   ``The area it comes from is older than beds in other parts of
the world where early mammals came from, such as in China, England,
South Africa and Arizona,'' Hopson said Wednesday.
   Openings in the brain casing indicate the mammal had a more
complex inner ear and circulatory system than reptiles, Lucas said.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis Says the White House Would Have Sent Her Over the
Edge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis says if her husband had become
president, the pressure of life in the White House would have sent
her over the edge.
   ``I am certain the first crisis would have sent me out of
control,'' the wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis said in her book, ``Now
You Know,'' excerpted in the current issue of Good Housekeeping and
reported in today's Boston Globe.
   ``I am equally certain that, thrust into the smothering,
protective confines of the White House, I would not have been able
to seek proper help.''
   Mrs. Dukakis acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction and
blamed many of her problems on her mother, Jane Goldberg Dickson,
and on her discovery that her mother was an adopted child of
illegitimate birth. Mrs. Dickson died in 1977.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she panicked before the New Hampshire primary
in 1988 when she realized her husband might win.
   ``Michael was good enough to be president, for sure, but was I
worthy to be his partner? In my despair, I turned to alcohol,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Dukakis wrote of periods of heavy drinking during the
campaign and after her husband's loss to George Bush as well. She
said she began a typical day at 9 a.m. by canceling her
appointments and downing three or four ounces of straight liquor.
   ``Then I'd go upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the phone, and
read till I passed out _ a process that usually took no more than
10 minutes. Two and a half hours later, I would wake up and repeat
the process,'' she said.
   The book, written with Jane Scovell, is due out in the fall.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she was 18 when cousin revealed that her
mother had been adopted.
   She said she was ``thunderstruck'' when she learned that the
couple she knew as her grandparents were her mother's adoptive
parents, and that the woman who lived with the couple as a nanny
was actually Mrs. Dukakis' grandmother.
   ``As far as I was concerned, there had been an enormous breach
of trust. That traumatic moment haunted me for years,'' Mrs.
Dukakis wrote.
   Within a year, Mrs. Dukakis said, she started using
amphetamines, or diet pills, discovered in her mother's room. She
said her mother ``took a lot of pills, including mood-altering
ones,'' and also was fond of alcohol.
   ``My mother was an extraordinary cook. But she never cooked a
meal without a glass of vermouth sitting on the counter next to
her. It was continuously filled,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   In the book, Mrs. Dukakis wondered if her 20-year addiction to
pills may have been responsible for four miscarriages she had
during her two marriages.
   She said her moods changed quickly whenever she stopped using
pills, causing her to fight with her husband and children.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who is taking lithium for manic depression, wrote
that when she was hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol last
year, she was not suicidal.

<TEXT>
   Leukemia patient Allison Atlas, whose nationwide
plea for a perfectly matched bone-marrow donor drew 50,000 people
to no avail, rested today in a hospital before transplant surgery
to receive her mother's marrow.
   The operation was scheduled for noon at Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center. The procedure could last as long as six hours.
   Miss Atlas, 20, of Bethesda, Md., decided to accept bone marrow
from her mother, even though it does not perfectly match her own,
while she was still strong enough to undergo the operation.
   Arline Atlas' marrow matches four of six antigens, or cell
identifers, in her daughter's marrow.
   The Atlas family mounted a search last fall for a perfect donor.
About 50,000 people in the United States and Israel took blood
tests to determine their chances, but none was suitable for Ms.
Atlas.
   Ten other people with leukemia found perfectly matched donors as
a result of the flood of new listings with the National Marrow
Donor Program.
   A support group, Friends of Allison, raised $3 million for
processing the samples. Actor Dustin Hoffman donated a six-figure
sum and made public appeals for help.
   Miss Atlas, who was a student at New York Unversity until she
became ill last year, was admitted to Fred Hutchinson on July 26.
She began chemotherapy July 31 to destroy her diseased marrow and
has responded well, center spokeswoman Alice Burgess said.
   Blood-producing marrow is a key element in the body's immune
system, and transplant recipients are extremely vulnerable to
infection immediately after the procedure, before the new marrow
begins functioning.

<HEAD>Peru's New Government Announces Harsh Austerity Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government of President Alberto
Fujimori has announced a harsh austerity plan aimed at ending
hyperinflation and rebuilding a collapsed economy. Troops were
deployed to head off any food riots.
   Subsidy cuts and a lifting of price controls mean Peruvians will
pay a lot more for food, gasoline and basic services, Economy and
Prime Minister Juan Hurtado Miller said in a nationally televised
speech Wednesday night.
   Hurtado said a gallon of gasoline would cost 30 times more
today. The price of milk and bread were to triple, while noodles
were to cost five times what they did Wednesday, he said.
   ``This is the price we must pay,'' said Hurtado. ``This is the
period for cleaning up and detoxifying.''
   The tough policy is a switch from the campaign platform of
gradual reform that helped catapult Fujimori from a virtual unknown
at the beginning of the year to the victor in the June election.
His opponent, acclaimed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, had backed
speedy market-oriented reform.
   But Fujimori, who took office July 28, has been told by
international creditors that he must control inflation before
they'll lend him more money.
   Soldiers and police took up positions throughout the capital
before Hurtado's speech. On Tuesday, the government declared a
state of emergency in Lima and 10 large cities, fearing food riots
would break out after the austerity measures were announced.
   Mobs on Tuesday looted the central markets of both Lima and the
nearby port of Callao before being controlled by police and
soldiers.
   Bread, noodles, beans, sugar, cooking oil and milk have all
disappeared from store shelves in recent days. This was due to both
panic-buying by consumers and hoarding by merchants, who were
awaiting higher prices.
   Most stores and market stalls remained closed in the hours
before Hurtado spoke.
   In his speech, Hurtado vowed to cut inflation to ``less than the
Latin American average'' by the end of the year. He said the
government will increase its income and spend only what it earns.
All price controls and subsidies will end, he said.
   The austerity measures also include emergency taxes on the
wealthy and a restructuring of import duties, Hurtado said.
   Press reports have said the government plans to devalue Peru's
inti by at least 50 percent, though Hurtado made no mention of such
a move Wednesday.
   To soften the effects of the measures on Peru's millions of poor
people, the government will set up soup kitchens and directly
subsidize water and bus services, Hurtado said.
   Fujimori has said that harsh measures are needed to stop Peru's
fall into economic chaos. Annual inflation tops 3,000 percent, four
of five people lack steady work and the economy has shrunk 20
percent in two years.
   Fujimori has taken office with Peru in the midst of its worst
drought this century, with up to 70 percent of the yearly
production of many basic crops destroyed. He must also deal with a
worsening guerrilla war that in the past 10 years has claimed
20,000 victims.
   Tension in the capital increased in the days leading up to
Hurtado Miller's announcement.
   The dollar doubled in value in the first three days of the week,
with its price jumping from 200,000 intis to 400,000.
   Many stores doubled their prices even before Hurtado spoke
Wednesday, getting a jump on the expected end of price controls.
   Other stores remained closed for fear that looting would break
out. Most market stalls were shuttered and those were open
displayed vastly reduced stocks.
   Drivers formed lines dozens of cars long to fill up before
gasoline prices jumped.
   The state of emergency declared in Lima and 10 other large
cities means that most of Peru is now under special law.
   A state of emergency is already in effect in half the country
due to guerrilla activity. It suspends constitutional guarantees of
freedom of travel and assembly and allows authorities to detain
people without hearing and search houses without warrant.

   Growing pessimism over the Middle East set stock
prices nose-diving in Tokyo today, and the dollar fell moderately
against the Japanese yen, traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 893.41 points, or 3.13
percent, ending the day at 27,615.73, its lowest level since Oct.
25, 1987, when the key index closed at 27,421.49.
   Traders said the Nikkei's fall quickened toward the end of
afternoon trading, when major securities houses such as Nomura
Securities Co. filed large sell orders in an attempt to take
profits between spot and the futures markets before today's
expiration of August options.
   ``The market was extremely weak, and almost no one was
interested in buying stocks,'' said Yoshio Ogawa, chief trader at
Nikko Securities Co.
   He said investors had become increasingly pessimistic about the
Middle East conflict, which they believe will be prolonged.
   The Tokyo stock market, already vulnerable due to higher
interest rates, has lost 4,348.01 points since July 20.
   ``It is rather natural for the index to plunge,'' said Masahiro
Yagi, deputy director of the capital trading department at Sanwa
Bank. ``The Japanese stock market has been suffering from
increasing interest rates, and that's the fundamental problem.''
   Yagi said the Bank of Japan will have to raise its discount
rate, now 5.25 percent, at some point.
   He said the Nikkei's 856.07-point surge on Wednesday was ``too
much considering the Middle East situation and rising interest
rates here.'' The market has not bottomed out, he added.
   Trading was thin today, with volume on the market's first
section estimated at 380 million shares, down from Wednesday's 580
million. About 5 percent of the issues remained unpriced with no
buy orders during the day.
   In contrast, the yen rose against the dollar as optimistic
currency investors sold the U.S. currency to take profits from its
surge following last Thursday's invasion by Iraq of Kuwait, dealers
said. The U.S. currency has gained 3.03 yen since last Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 149.68 yen, down 0.32 yen from Wednesday's
150.00-yen finish. It opened at 149.50 yen and ranged between
149.50 yen and 149.90 yen.
   ``Currency investors think the Middle East situation will not
get much worse, because many countries are jointly putting pressure
on Iraq,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in
Tokyo.
   The U.N. Security Council voted Monday for a worldwide economic
boycott of Iraq. The major industrial nations have already begun
sanctions, including an oil boycott.
   As higher prices and other negative effects of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti
conflict have been gradually factored into the market, investors
began selling the dollar, which they had overbought as a safe haven
in the wake of the Iraqi invasion last week, Ms. Takeuchi said.
   She said a declining trend in oil prices, which had surged to
about $28 a barrel earlier this week, also encouraged the yen's
strength against the dollar.
   Traders said the slide in oil prices resulted from prospects for
higher oil production by Saudi Arabia and other producers.
   At about 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT), Brent crude oil for October
delivery was valued at about $23.60-$23.70 a barrel, down from
$26.00-$26.20 Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 7.985 percent, up from
Wednesday's close of 7.915 percent. Their price ended at 83.52
points, down from 83.80 points.

   Pamela Richards became a hero at the auto
parts plant where she works when she refused on a game show to
accept a new car made at a non-union factory.
   But when the show aired a night after it was recorded, censors
deleted her explanation for rejecting the $17,500 Honda Accord.
   ``I was disappointed when they bleeped out my comment. I didn't
slam Honda. I just wanted to get across that I'm proud to be a
union member,'' Mrs. Richards, a member of United Auto Workers,
said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Richards has worked 23 years at Toledo Precision Machining,
a Chrysler Corp. subsidiary in Risingsun, a town of 700 about 30
miles from Toledo. The UAW has been trying for years without
success to organize employees at Honda's U.S. plants in Marysville,
100 miles from of Risingsun.
   Mrs. Richards was one of four contestants competing for cash and
Ohio-made prizes on an Ohio Lottery TV show videotaped Friday and
broadcast Saturday.
   When her turn came to choose from 24 boxes containing cash and
prizes, she picked one that revealed she had won an Accord made in
Marysville.
   She had the choice of accepting the car and ending her
participation or taking the cash prize in the same box and
continuing.
   ``I don't want that Honda. I am union,'' she said, accepting
instead the cash prize of $1,000. Ultimately, she won $6,400.
   At Toledo Precision Machining, workers hung a banner commending
her loyalty.
   ``It make me feel good. But I'm sure others at the plant would
have done the same thing,'' Mrs. Richards said.
   ``The union has given me a lot through the years. A lot of
benefits, wage increases, security when I retire. I feel if they
could give me this all these years, I can buy union-made products.''
   Marcus Advertising, which produces the TV program, made the
decision to edit her criticism of Honda. James Reed, a Marcus
account supervisor, defended the editing, saying companies often
provide the prizes at deep discounts.
   Bob Kowalcyzk, marketing director for the Ohio Lottery
Commission, said the censors may have overreacted. ``It is not
necessarily a forum for free speech. But what are we messing with
when we make these kind of decisions?'' he asked.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that
Iraq would be inviting a ``heavy tragedy'' if it attacked Israel
over allegations the Jewish state was sending forces to assist the
U.S. defense of Saudi Arabia.
   The concern was triggered by Iraq's claim on Wednesday that
camouflaged Israeli planes were participating in the U.S. military
build-up in the Persian Gulf. The Israeli army vehemently denied
the allegations.
   Media reports suggested preparations were in full gear to defend
against a possible strike by Iraq, which invaded Kuwait a week ago
and is reported to have massed 100,000 troops on the Saudi border.
   ``Whoever plots to attack Israel must know that Israel has the
capability, will and readiness to defend its security absolutely,
and whoever tries to hurt it is liable to bring on himself a heavy
tragedy,'' Shamir said on Israel radio.
   He assured Arab nations ``Israel has no intentions whatsoever to
attack any of its neighbors.''
   But he added, ``Israel's defense and security forces are aware
and alert and devoting their efforts to prevent any danger to the
people and state.''
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens and other leaders also said they
took the Iraqi threat seriously. Newspaper editorials called for
distribution of gas masks to defend against a possible assault by
chemical weapons.
   Shamir also ordered Cabinet ministers traveling abroad to
prepare to return, officials in his office said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Israelis have remained glued to their
radios, hoping that their ally the United States would rein in
Saddam's aggression.
   Jerusalem and Baghdad traded threats in April, when Saddam said
he would torch half of Israel with chemical weapons if attacked by
the Jewish state.
   The Iraqi statement Wednesday was widely seen as a possible
pretext for such an attack.
   ``Israeli warplanes were painted with American colors and
Israeli pilots were provided with American identity papers in order
to avoid Iraq's reaction against Israel,'' said a statement
broadcast on Baghdad radio.
   ``We hereby warn ... that we will answer back to any aggressive
act by Israel, as we would to any such act by the United States,''
the Iraqi statement added.
   Israel today was faced with the delicate dilemma of warding off
Iraq's threats while trying to refrain from involvement in the
Persian Gulf conflict. Analysts said there was concern that any
Israeli intervention could also run the risk of Israel getting into
a war with Iraq's Arab allies.
   On Wednesday, Shamir expressed support for the U.S. move into
Saudi Arabia as a show of force against Iraq, whose 1-million-man
army poses the most dangerous Arab threat to Israel.
   But officials also said the United States had not asked Israel
to commit troops to the Persian Gulf, and that such a request was
not expected.
   The army has decided in principle to distribute gas masks to the
entire population over the next six months, army officials said.
Israelis, increasingly anxious over Iraq's military expansion had
already begun stockpiling canned goods in their attics and looking
for gas masks to purchase.
   Israeli generals held an emergency meeting last weekend and
decided to step up the distribution of gas masks nationwide, but
some Israelis are too jittery to wait for the army-issued equipment.

<HEAD>Showers over Middle Atlantic States, Heat Wave Lingers in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers were scattered over the Middle Atlantic states today,
and a heat wave lingered in most the nation's interior.
   Today's forecast said thunderstorms were likely to develop over
the Carolinas, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin and
northeastern California.
   Rain also was likely in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
   Temperatures were expected to soar above 90 degrees over much of
the Plains and the West, and exceed 100 west of the Rockies and in
the desert Southwest.
   On Wednesday, temperatures pushed above 100 across much of the
West as far north as Washington and Idaho. Pasco, Wash., reached
103 and Ontario, Ore., hit 105.
   In Georgia, thunderstorms produced large hail near Roswell,
toppled trees at Stathams Landing and near Veazey, and downed power
lines and trees near Rockledge, Lothar and Soperton.
   Thunderstorms produced winds gusting to 55 mph in Atlanta and
hail as large as golf balls in Marion County, Fla.
   The high temperature for the nation was 121 degrees at Death
Valley, Calif.

<HEAD>Dart Man OK to Stand Trial, Charges Lowered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of being the ``Dart Man'' who
shot pins into women's buttocks was found mentally competent to
stand trial. But the charges were downgraded from felonies to
misdemeanors and he was freed on bail.
   Criminal Court Judge John Walsh released Jerome Wright, 33, on
$1,000 bail Wednesday.
   The reduced charges mean Wright would face only a year in jail
if convicted on a weapons possession charge, said Colleen Roche,
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. She would not
explain why the charges were reduced.
   Wright, who made a rambling statement to police after his
arrest, was examined by psychiatrists and ruled fit to stand trial.
   Police believe Wright used a blowgun to fire homemade darts
fashioned from pins and paper at 55 women, all wearing skirts. The
attacks, mostly in midtown Manhattan, took place between June 13
and his arrest on July 13.
   Wright was charged in only two attacks. Assistant District
Attorney John Sullivan requested permission Wednesday for another
two victims to see Wright in a lineup.
   Defense attorney Robert Wolf said he has evidence Wright was at
work when the attacks occurred.
   In addition to the weapons charge, Wright faces two misdemeanor
counts of reckless endangerment and two misdemeanor counts of
harassment.

<HEAD>Atlantis Back at Hangar; Columbia Heading Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented shuttle shuffle,
NASA returned Atlantis to the hangar today for repair of a hydrogen
leak and sent a newly fixed Columbia out to the launch pad to await
a September liftoff.
   Columbia had been rolled back to the hangar in June because of a
hydrogen leak.
   It was the first time two shuttles had passed one another in
upright launch positions.
   ``It's interesting both are passing, but it's unfortunate one's
having to be brought back off the pad,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham.
   Atlantis began the 3{-mile trip to the hangar Wednesday night
and arrived around 4 a.m., nearly six hours later. NASA parked
Atlantis outside the doors of the crowded hangar, and around
daybreak rolled Columbia out past Atlantis toward the vacated pad.
   Atlantis was expected to be inside the hangar by mid-afternoon,
after Columbia was secured at the pad.
   Until June, NASA had moved a shuttle from the launch pad back to
the hangar on only three occasions, the most recent in 1985.
   During its two months in the hangar, Columbia's leaky fuel lines
were replaced with components from the new shuttle Endeavour, under
construction in California.
   NASA is working toward a Sept. 4 or 5 liftoff of Columbia with
the $150 million Astro observatory. Atlantis' secret military
mission, originally scheduled for July, is off until November.
   Columbia's leak was detected during fueling for a May 30 launch
attempt. The leak on Atlantis was discovered during a test June 29.
   Atlantis' leak prompted NASA to ground the three-shuttle fleet
temporarily. Agency officials have since determined the leaks on
the two spaceships are different.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower In Cautious Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly lower in cautious European
trading late this morning as dealers awaited fresh developments in
the Persian Gulf.
   Gold prices rose more than $3.50 an ounce in London but were
fractionally lower in Zurich.
   Currency dealers ascribed the dollar's relative steadiness to
the absence of major news from the Middle East overnight.
   ``The whole market has calmed down,'' said a trader at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. ``I think the market is
consolidating.''
   Another trader at a major West German bank in Frankfurt said the
market remained nervous about a possible outbreak of Mideast
fighting. He said the dollar could jump several pfennigs if
hostilities are reported.
   In Milan, one trader said: ``The dollar has completely lost its
role as a `safe haven' currency.''
   He added that the U.S. currency is poised to move lower in the
near term because of soft U.S. interest rates. But in the longer
term, he said, there ``will be physical demand for dollars to pay
for higher oil prices'' and this will push the dollar back up.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.32 yen to a closing 149.68 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 149.60 yen.
   Japanese dealers said a bout of profit-taking followed dollar's
surge following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait a week ago.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.5917 West German marks, down from 1.5940
   _1.3397 Swiss francs, down from 1.3435
   _5.3358 French francs, down from 5.3445
   _1.7915 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7955
   _1,165.00 Italian lire, down from 1,166.37
   _1.1475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1485
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.8720, compared with $1.8660 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $382.80 a troy ounce, up
from $382.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $385.85.
   London dealers said trading was volatile amid nervousness over
the direction of oil prices and developments in the Persian Gulf.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $384.25, down from $384.35 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.52 to close at a bid $384.17.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $4.89 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $4.87.

<HEAD>Soviet Cosmonauts Return After Problem-Plagued Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet cosmonauts returned safely to Earth
today, ending a six-month mission during which they grew
million-dollar crystals for industry and survived a near-fatal
space walk trying to repair damage on their capsule.
   The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and
Alexander Balandin landed near the town on Arkalyk on the Central
Asian steppes, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The landing, one minute ahead of schedule, was not shown live on
Soviet television, but at the midday news showed pictures of the
cosmonauts waving goodbye to their replacement crew aboard the
orbiting Mir space station.
   Solovyev and Balandin were launched into space Feb. 11 in what
was billed as the first manned mission in the 33-year history of
the Soviet space program to turn a multimillion-dollar profit.
   Their hundreds of experiments included photographing 8.4 million
square miles of the Earth's surface and growing 23 pure crystals
for use in semiconductors and computer chips.
   Each crystal is worth about $1 million, Tass said.
   The cosmonauts also made two space walks last month, the first
to repair damage caused to the spacecraft on takeoff.
   On July 17, they spent seven hours repairing torn thermal
insulation surrounding the Soyuz capsule which would bring them
back to Earth. The repairs took longer than expected and Soviet
media reported the two cosmonauts could have died because their
oxygen was running so low.
   Their spacesuits soaked with perspiration from the exertion,
they were forced to leave the capsule's re-entry hatch slightly
ajar and return to the space station through an emergency porthole.
They left behind handrails attached to the exterior of the capsule.
   A second, shorter, space walk on July 26 was needed to close the
hatch and retrieve the handrails.
   Tass quoted ground control officials as saying Solovyev and
Balandin had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely
depressurized and it swung outward with such force that a key joint
was damaged.
   It was the latest in a series of problems for the Soviet manned
space program, which for decades had been a source of intense
national pride.
   For the past two years, the program has been plagued by docking
equipment malfunctions, human error and budget cuts.
   The replacement crew of Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov
docked with the Mir on Friday, two days after blasting off from the
Baikanor Space Center in Kazakhstan. They will remain in space
until Dec. 10, conducting an estimated 250 experiments, including
the production of more crystals.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressure has grown on the
space program to prove its worth in a shortage-plagued society.
Some Soviet lawmakers have raised the once taboo topic of cutting
the space budget since many Soviet people don't have decent housing
or enough to eat.
   Manakov and Strekalov will return to Earth with a paying
customer, a Japanese cosmonaut who will have been brought to Mir on
Dec. 2 by their replacement crew.
   Two employees of the Tokyo Broadcasting System are vying for the
seat: television camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi and former Washington
bureau chief Toyhiro Akiyama.
   Future flights in 1992 will carry British, Austrian, West
German, French and Spanish passengers.

<HEAD>Swiss Hostage Freed, But Colleague Still Held in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese kidnappers early today released
a Swiss Red Cross worker from 10 months of captivity, but one of
his colleagues remained a hostage.
   It was the first release of a Western hostage since two
Americans were freed in April. Officials denied any deal was made
for today's release.
   Emanuel Christen, 33, was set free just after midnight Wednesday
by a group calling itself The Palestinian Revolutionary Squads.
   The group had said in a statement Tuesday that his colleague _
24-year-old Elio Erriquez _ would also be released. There was no
immediate explanation for why only Christen was freed.
   A total of 15 Westerners, including Erriquez, remain hostage in
Lebanon. They include six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Christen was handed over to Swiss Charge d'Affaires Fritz Kuehni
at the Syrian Foreign Ministry in Damascus, witnesses said. They
said Kuehni and Christen were then driven to the Swiss Embassy.
   A member of the Swiss embassy in Damascus, Claudine Zbinden,
said Christen had lost about 30 pounds. ``But he is in relative
good shape, if one may say so,'' Ms. Zbinden said today in a
telephone interview.
   Red Cross officials said Christen was expected to return to
Switzerland by special flight due to arrive in Zurich this
afternoon.
   Christen and Erriquez were kidnapped Oct. 6. Both were
orthopedic technicians helping to manufacture artificial limbs for
Lebanon's war wounded in the southern city of Sidon, 25 miles south
of Beirut.
   In Beirut, his kidnappers issued a statement Wednesday night,
but it did not explain why only one captive went free.
   ``After we have promised last night to release the two delegates
of the International Red Cross in Lebanon within 24 hours, one of
them, Emanuel Christen, has been set free and handed over to a
representative of Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan at 6 p.m. this evening,''
said the text in full. It was handwritten in Arabic.
   The statement, signed by The Palestinian Revolutionary Squads,
was delivered to the Beirut office of a Western news agency. It was
accompanied by an instant photograph of Christen.
   Kenaan is the chief of Syrian army intelligence in Lebanon,
whose headquarters are in the east Lebanon village of Anjar in the
Bekaa valley.
   The statement said the decision to free the Red Cross captives
came in response to the wishes of Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid.
   Both the Swiss Foreign Ministry and the Geneva-headquartered
International Committee of the Red Cross denied that any deal had
been made with the kidnappers. In their statement Tuesday, the
Palestine Revolutionary Squads said they had decided to free the
two Swiss ``after we acquired guarantees that our demands will be
met.''
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Michel Pache said Swiss
authorities never had any contact with the kidnappers. ``We never
knew who they were and what they wanted.''
   The longest held foreign hostage in Lebanon is Terry Anderson,
42, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. The two most recently freed hostages were
Americans Frank Herbert Reed, 57, and Robert Polhill, 55. Both were
freed in April.

   Air raid sirens wailed in Amman today. A
government security official said Israeli jets had violated
Jordanian air space but the official news agency said it was an
unannounced test.
   The official, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said he had no immediate additional information.
   The siren warning came at 1:15 p.m. as the streets of the
capital were jammed with traffic during the lunchtime break. The
Petra news agency report said the sirens also sounded in the cities
of Irbid and Zurka.
   In the capital, people rushed to balconies and into the streets
to scan the skies for a few minutes. They returned to whatever they
were doing when they saw nothing.
   Despite the sirens there was no apparent move by citizens to
rush to air raid shelters.
   Amman is only 30 miles from the Israeli border, only a few
seconds flying time for a warplane.
   The warning added to the tension created by the weeklong crisis
that began when Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait.
   There is fear that any clash between U.S. troops now being
deployed in Saudi Arabia and Iraqi troops just across the border in
Kuwait could spark a full blown Middle East war.
   Israeli forces were on alert today. Israel has said previously
that it would move into Jordan if Iraqi forces crossed the
Iraqi-Jordanian frontier.
   Concern markedly following King Hussein's warning late Wednesday
that an Arab summit scheduled to start in Cairo later today was
``the last chance'' to avert the outbreak of war.

   Tropical Storm Edouard, packing top sustained winds
of nearly 45 mph, buffeted part of the Azores early today and
passed fewer than 100 miles from the Mid-Atlantic Portuguese
archipelago.
   Edouard's winds and rain blanketed the islands of Terceira and
Horta and tropical storm conditions were expected to continue
throughout the day.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Edouard's center was located near 38.3 north
latitude, 28.9 west longitude, or about 80 miles west southwest of
Terceira, according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   ``Edouard is certainly over the Azores right now, and they're
feeling it,'' said Miles Lawrence, hurricane specialist at the
center.
   The storm was heading east northeast at about 12 mph and was
expected to hold the same course and speed for the next 24 hours.
Lawrence said little change in strength was likely today for
Edouard.
   ``It's heading towards northern Europe, but it doesn't appear to
be doing anything dramatic,'' Lawrence said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard began to cut back crews
today as the cleanup of a 700,000-gallon oil spill in Galveston Bay
nears an end.
   Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Rich Muller said salvage crews
were sopping up remaining pockets of sludge near Houston Point in
the bay's northernmost part, but Coast Guard officials believe the
$3 million cleanup should be complete by Friday.
   ``We still have some people up there,'' Muller said of the
Houston Point area. ``That operation will be shutting down, just
because there isn't that much left to do.''
   Other crews, meanwhile, continue to take apart a battered barge
that remained outside the Houston Ship Channel.
   Crews began cutting the barge, one of two ruptured in a July 28
collision with a Greek tanker, with blow torches on Wednesday so
that the pieces can be moved to a Galveston scrap yard.
   Once the barge is severed, the Coast Guard plans to reopen the
ship channel to two-way deep draft ship traffic for the first time
since the accident.
   The Greek tanker Shinoussa collided with two of three barges
being towed by the tugboat, Chandy N, through the ship channel in
the bay. The tanker, although damaged, lost none of its cargo of
jet fuel because of a double hull, but the two barges spewed
700,000 gallons of a heavy catfeed oil used in petroleum refining.
   The accident, near Redfish Island, created a slick that at one
time measured 17 miles in length and threatened most of the
sensitive wildlife areas of the bay. The Texas Department of Health
is maintaining a ban on shellfishing in most areas of the bay
because of the spill.

<TEXT>
   A salesman says he developed suicidal impulses
while taking the anti-depression drug Prozac, and he once
intentionally smashed his car into a truck.
   In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Ralph
Langer of suburban Chicago is seeking more than $1 million in
damages from the drug manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of
Indianapolis, and its subsidiary, Dista Products Co.
   Langer contends in the lawsuit that Eli Lilly has failed to warn
doctors about what the suit said is a link between Prozac and
suicidal or aggressive behavior.
   An Eli Lilly spokeswoman refused to comment on the lawsuit, but
defended the drug as safe.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has no evidence of the
drug being linked to specific deaths and still considers the drug
safe, spokeswoman Eva Kemper said in a telephone interview from
Maryland.
   Langer contends he began experiencing suicidal and
self-destructive impulses after his therapist prescribed Prozac in
September 1987 to treat his depression.
   Other lawsuits also have been filed involving the drug.
   A New York woman sued Lilly last month. In addition, the widows
of three victims of a Kentucky man who murdered eight people before
shooting himself are each suing the pharmaceuticals company for $50
million, saying the aggression was linked to Prozac.
   Langer's lawsuit says that at one point while on the drug, he
intentionally drove his car at high speed into the rear of a truck.
He suffered broken bones and bruises in the crash.
   His attorney, Aron D. Robinson of Chicago, said his client had
never had suicidal impulses before being prescribed Prozac.
   He said this was the pattern in other Prozac cases studied by
his law firm.
   The aggressive or suicidal behavior ``began when the person
first began taking the drug and ended when the person was taken off
the drug,'' he said.
   Lilly spokeswoman Mari Abbott said the drug was tested on more
than 11,000 people before it was marketed. It has been prescribed
for more than 2 million patients without evidence that it was
linked to suicidal impulses, Ms. Abbott said.
   ``All of the data we have does not show a cause-and-effect
relationship between our product and suicidal thoughts and acts,''
she said. ``The safety and effectiveness of this product has been
tested.''

<HEAD>Cook County School Funds Reported in Non-Interest Bearing Accounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superintendent of Cook County schools
continued to deposit millions of dollars in state and federal funds
into accounts that pay no interest after promising to stop, a
newpaper reported today.
   Superintendent Richard Martwick had made the pledge after a
lawsuit in 1985 and criticism from prior state audits, according to
today's Chicago Tribune.
   But a partially complete audit for 1989 shows Martwick continued
putting the money into the non-interest accounts, said spokesman
Lee Milner of the state Board of Education.
   More than $1.35 billion went into the accounts, costing
taxpayers as much as $400,000 a year in lost interest, the Tribune
said.
   The Tribune said Martwick could not be reached for comment. The
bank's general counsel, William Dunn, declined to comment on the
deposits.
   State officials say the average daily balance in the account
Martwick keeps at Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank is $6.5
million to $7 million.
   State audits in 1987 and 1988 revealed the practice. After the
1988 audit, Martwick's office said the money would be invested in
an interest-bearing account.
   In the 1985 lawsuit, four school districts filed a class-action
suit in U.S. District Court charging the non-interest deposits
violated state and federal laws and deprived school districts
access to money to which they were entitled. The suit is still
pending.
   Last year, Cook County Clerk Stanley Kusper deposited $6.8
million in a non-interest account at Amalgamated.
   Amalgamated has been the depository of state government funds
and has made loans to prominent politicians, including Gov. James
Thompson, the Tribune said.

   A State Department task force has taken more than 11,000 calls
from people wanting information about Americans stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq, but word from the Middle East is reaching loved ones only
in dribs and drabs.
   Kevin York of Mount Prospect, Ill., has not talked to his wife,
Faye, who was in Iraq to visit friends and family, since before the
Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``She called (her sister) Amy at 1 a.m. last Thursday, bawling
her eyes out, saying that she was at the airport (in Baghdad) but
couldn't get on the plane because the airline wouldn't accept her
ticket. Then they closed the airport,'' he said.
   Mrs. York, a 31-year-old naturalized American of Iraqi descent,
is two months pregnant with their first child, York said.
   President Bush on Wednesday said U.S. troops were sent to Saudi
Arabia to deter an attack from Iraq. Also Wednesday, Iraq annexed
Kuwait.
   Poor telephone connections and confusion in Baghdad have made
contact difficult if not impossible since the invasion. Some
Americans said they heard about relatives through employers or the
State Department.
   Thirty-eight Americans remain in a Baghdad hotel from which they
are not allowed to leave, State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said Wednesday. The hotel is under guard, but the Americans
are safe, he said.
   He estimated there are 400 Americans in Iraq and 3,000 in
Kuwait. The task force is tracking 1,468 people in Kuwait and Iraq
it has identified or been in contact with, Boucher said.
   Emily Abramson of Southbury, Conn., said the decision to send
U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia has increased her fears for the safety
of her son and his family trapped in Kuwait.
   ``I'm dreadfully upset today, more so than I was up to now,''
she said Wednesday. She said the State Department has told her that
her son, Paul Pawlowski, his wife, Ingrid, and their 6-year-old
daughter, Tess, are safe.
   But Mrs. Abramson, a 79-year-old widow who lives alone, said she
has only left her house to go to the mailbox.
   ``I don't dare,'' she said. ``I'd rather be here in case a call
comes through.''
   Edwin and Irene Davis of Koran, La., last heard from their
daughter in a 4 a.m. telephone call a week ago: ``Daddy, don't
worry; we're under attack.''
   ``I know what warfare in the cities is like _ trigger-happy and
nervous. I advised them to stay in the house. I hope that's what
they did,'' said Davis, a retired Baptist minister.
   Their daughter, Martha; her Kuwaiti-born husband, Mahmoud
Al-Ghareeb, and their children, Millie, 18, and Michael, 14, were
visiting Al-Ghareeb's parents.
   Boucher said U.S. officials have met with the Americans at the
Rashid Hotel in Baghdad.
   ``What we are doing is trying to obtain Iraqi government consent
to open the borders, to open the airports, and to allow people to
leave the country,'' Boucher said. ``We are certainly working to
see that all Americans, including these people at the Rashid Hotel,
are free to go and are able to leave the country.''
   A 39th American at the hotel, 10-year-old Penelope Nabokov of
Albany, Calif., was taken to the U.S. Embassy by agreement with
Iraq, the State Department said Wednesday. One official said he did
not know where she would go next or when.
   The girl's family said she was among 367 passengers taken from a
British Airways jet in Kuwait while the invasion was under way. She
was traveling alone to India, where her mother was doing research.

<DATELINE>HARPSWELL, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents keep their windows shut and an
inn has closed as the stench from thousands of rotting fish fills
the air.
   In the waters of Quahog Bay, Maine's latest menhaden kill has
suffocated thousands of lobsters, crabs, snails and other sea life.
   ``The eels are even dead and they're hard to kill,'' said Linda
Webber, who owns Webber and Sons Lobster Co. with her husband in
this seacoast town of 2,500 about 15 miles from Portland. Webber
said the company has lost about $10,000 worth of lobsters.
   Robert Waddle, owner of Quahog Lobster Inc., the other lobster
dealer at Quahog Bay, said he has lost at least that much. Lobsters
generally sell for less than $4 a pound in Maine this time of year;
wholesalers commonly keep the crustaceans in holding pens in bays
or harbors.
   ``The overall loss is tremendous. Not just my loss, but
everyone's loss because everything in the bay's been killed,''
Waddle said.
   Vast schools of menhaden, or pogies, first were chased into
Quahog Bay by feeding bluefish about a month ago, Waddle said
Wednesday. The schools severely depleted the oxygen in the water,
killing lobsters and other aquatic life.
   Dead pogies can be seen floating in clumps throughout the cove
and are caked onto rocks along the shore.
   ``It's been like this for almost a month, but the past few days
have been unbearable,'' said Marianne Lavine, who has kept a summer
home at Quahog Bay for 20 years. ``We've had the doors and windows
closed for three days now. It irritates your throat and nose. It's
disgusting.''
   The smell is so bad that a bed-and-breakfast on the bay closed.
One of the inn's owners said he and his wife will not reopen until
the odor is gone.
   Fish kills have happened along Maine's coast several times in
recent years, but ``this is certainly a large die-off,'' said
Marshall Murphy, spokesman for the state Department of Marine
Resources.
   Pogies are oily fish that can weigh up to two pounds and are
used for lobster bait, fertilizer and cat food.
   An estimated 3,000 pounds of pogies, or 50 bushels, washed
ashore in Belfast Bay in September 1987. In August 1985, about
8,000 bushels of pogies washed into a cove in Southport, and
officials brought in a huge vacuum cleaner to suck the rotting fish
out of the water. In 1984 about 25,000 menhaden and 500 bluefish
died in the Kennebec River, also from oxygen deprivation.
   Murphy said the state won't attempt a cleanup in Quahog Bay. He
said past cleanups have proved to be ``very expensive and less than
totally successful.''
   ``At this point, our decision is to allow nature to continue the
decomposition process of the menhaden,'' he said. It takes about 10
days for the fish to decompose.
   There is no river is at the head of the bay to flush the cove,
so only winds and tides may help.
   A northerly wind last week carried some of the pogies away, but
a southwesterly wind this week carried the dead fish back into the
bay, Murphy said.

   Two freight trains collided in northwest
Georgia early today, killing three people and injuring four.
   Authorities said a northbound freight train ran head-on into
another train that was traveling onto the main Norfolk Southern
track from a side track shortly before 3:30 a.m. in a rural area
west of Resaca, about 60 miles north of Atlanta.
   The engineer and conductor of the train on the main track and
the conductor of the other train were killed, said Norfolk Southern
spokesman Bob Auman.
   Four other railroad employees were taken to Gordon County
Hospital in Calhoun with bruises. Hospital officials said three
would be treated and released and one admitted.
   Auman said both engines on one of the trains and one of the
engines of the other train derailed and caught fire. In addition,
at least 14 cars derailed, but none carried hazardous materials.

   King Fahd said today that foreign
nations were not establishing a permanent military presence in his
kingdom.
   ``These forces from friendly powers are here temporarily,'' the
king said in the nationally televised address, his first public
statement since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed it on
Wednesday.
   He spoke as at least 5,000 U.S. troops were pouring into Saudi
Arabia, backed by an armada of U.S. air and seapower in the region.
Another 4,000 U.S. Marines were moving close to the Saudi-Kuwait
border, diplomatic sources said.
   The king said the forces ``are to help defend the kingdom,
participate in joint exercises, and will leave here as soon as the
kingdom so demands.''
   He stressed that inviting Western and Arab forces to the kingdom
was ``not directed against anyone, but a purely defensive measure.''
   He said American, British and other unspecified forces were
invited into the country due to the the Iraqi troop buildup on the
Saudi-Kuwaiti border and to help Saudi Arabia in its duty to defend
its territory.
   The Iraqis ``massed large numbers of troops on the border of the
kingdom,'' the king said. ``Faced with this bitter reality, and out
of keenness to safeguard its territory and economy ... The kingdom
expresses a desire to Arab and friendly forces to participate'' in
the multinational force.
   Fahd called Iraq's move ``the most horrible aggression the Arab
nation has known in its modern history,'' and demanded a withdrawal
of Iraqi troops.
   ``Saudia Arabia calls for a return of things as they were before
the Iraqi invasion and that the ruling family be allowed to be
reinstated,'' he said in reference to the exiled Al-Sabah family.
   ``The invasion has caused Kuwaitis to become refugees, to
suffer. The kingdom of Saudia Arabia is very upset at this attack,
this invasion from Iraq,'' Fahd added.
   Fahd said he supported all attempts to resolve the crisis,
adding: ``We are supportive of the decision of the Islamic summit,
the Arab League, the Council of Gulf States and the international
community.''
   ``We are hoping that the emergency Arab summit called by Hosni
Mubarak, president of brotherly Egypt, that this summit will bring
the results that will (lead to) unity and solidarity among the Arab
world.''
   Egypt and Morocco have refused to join the U.S. and other
Western forces. Arab leaders were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch
effort to resolve the crisis caused by the invasion and the troop
buildup on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border.

<HEAD>Good Samaritan Ends Standoff Between Illegal Parker and Tow-Truck
Operator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nine hours, the illegally parked motorist
went eyeball to eyeball with a highly determined tow truck driver.
Neither blinked.
   Finally, early today, a knight in a white Lincoln Continental
came to the rescue.
   The standoff began Wednesday afternoon when Ann Miser parked in
a private lot without paying. In 10 minutes, Wilbey Mullen was
hooking Miser's car to his tow truck.
   Miser, apparently aware that it is illegal here to tow a car
carrying a passenger, jumped in the front seat and refused to budge.
   Mullen, 26, an employee of Maryland Impounding Inc., demanded a
$110 towing fee to unhook Miser's car.
   Miser said she would pay, but only had a check.
   Mullen refused. ``Company policy. You can't stop payment on
cash,'' he explained.
   Miser got a passer-by to call a co-worker, who telephoned area
television stations and a member of the City Council. An
unidentified woman also came to Miser's aid by bringing dinner _ a
turkey sandwich, boiled egg, pickles, raisins and a jug of water.
   Watching the local 11 p.m. newscasts, which featured live
reports on the impasse, was Norman McCarthy.
   McCarthy, who described himself as a celebrity bodyguard, was
naturally sympathetic since his car had been towed last fall. He
drove right down to the parking lot.
   In the meantime, Mullen had kept his meter running and was
demanding $400 by the time McCarthy arrived.
   He was willing to settle for $200, which the good Samaritan paid
off in nickels, dimes and quarters he kept in a plastic water
bottle in his car.
   ``I just don't want her to sit in the car, and I want to get rid
of my change,'' said McCarthy.
   Mullen was grateful: ``Thanks a lot, man. Now I can go home.''
   All Miser could say was: ``I just can't believe it.''

<TEXT>
   I want my MTV royalties, says a
39-year-old man who claims in a federal lawsuit that the music
television network stole his copyrighted idea for a rock 'n' roll
game show.
   Mark Winik, who runs a printing supply company, is suing MTV and
its parent company, Viacom Inc., over the network's 3-year-old game
show ``Remote Control'' and a 1990 show called ``Turn It Up.''
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, contends
Winik developed an idea in 1985 for a game show called ``Rockout.''
He copyrighted the concept and tried to sell it to MTV in 1986, but
the music network rejected his proposal, the suit said.
   ``Come to find out, sometime down the road, that the idea he
proposed he saw on TV,'' said Winik's lawyer, Henry B. Henrici.
   Hilary Condit, a spokeswoman for Viacom, said Wednesday the
company does not comment on pending litigation.
   Winik's lawsuit claims that ``key creative and distinct
elements'' of the game shows were stolen from him. His suit asks
for $100,000 for every instance of copyright infringement.
   Winik said his concept was to combine a traditional television
game show with trivia questions about rock music and a segment in
which contestants would try to identify artists or songs by
watching small parts of videos or listening to the first few bars
of a song.
   He said he went to New York in 1986 to discuss the idea with MTV
officials.
   ``They told me the idea was too commercial and wouldn't fit into
their programming, and then two years later they premiered `Remote
Control,''' Winik said.

<HEAD>Ambassador Suggests Iraq Prepared To Use Chemical Weapons If
Attacked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is prepared to use chemical weapons
if attacked, Baghdad's envoy to Greece suggested today.
   ``If we are attacked by a foreign power we will retaliate with
all sorts of defensive weapons that we have,'' the ambassador,
Abdel Fetah al-Khazreji, said in a telephone interview.
   Earlier, he was asked by reporters if Iraq had been preparing
for chemical warfare since its invasion of Kuwait last week.
Khazreji said that no special preparations had been made, but
acknowledged that Baghdad has chemical arms.
   President Bush has promised severe retaliation if President
Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against American soldiers.
   Thousands of American troops have arrived in Saudi Arabi to
defend the desert kingdom against possible attack in the wake of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait one week ago.
   Saddam used chemical weapons against Iran during the countries'
eight-year war, and also against Iraq's rebellious Kurdish minority.
   Saddam also threatened in April to attack Israel with chemical
weapons in the event of an Israeli attack.
   ``As we have declared for the last couple of months we have said
that we will retaliate if Israel attacks any of our installations.
But we will only act defensively,'' Khazreji said.
   The Iraqi envoy denied reports that Iraqi forces have been
increased on the border with Turkey, and he also reiterated the
Iraqi claim that there are no plans to attack Saudi Arabia.
   ``There is no deployment against Saudi Arabia. We will only
strike at any country that attacks us,'' he said.

   The case of the Central Park jogger was sent to
a jury after the prosecutor reminded jurors of the brutal gang rape
and beating endured by the victim.
   ``Imagine what went through the mind of (the jogger) as the
attackers surrounded her and started ripping off her clothes,''
Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer said in her four-hour
summation Wednesday.
   ``Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana had their fun
in Central Park on April 19, 1989,'' she said, referring to the
teen-age defendants. ``Today they have no one to blame for their
predicament but themselves. They showed no sympathy or mercy. ...
The only fair and just verdict is guilty.''
   Justice Thomas Galligan instructed the jurors, who began
deliberating this morning.
   Salaam, 16, Santana, 15, and McCray, 16, are charged in
Manhattan's state Supreme Court with attempted murder, rape, sexual
abuse, riot, assault and robbery in attacks on the woman and on two
male joggers during a gang rampage.
   About 10 minutes into Lederer's summation, a row of family and
supporters of the defendants walked out of the courtroom together
without speaking.
   ``The defendants dragged her into the cover of darkness,'' about
78 feet into the woods from the area where she took her nightly
run, and there beat and raped her, Lederer said.
   ``These defendants wanted her to die,'' the prosecutor said,
``and they took the steps to make that happen. These defendants had
every reason for not wanting her to survive.''
   The woman lost three-fourths of her blood in the ordeal.
   The jogger is back at work as a vice president at Salomon
Brothers investment bankers, but she testified that she still
suffers from impaired sight, balance and smell as a result of the
attack.
   ``The fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a
miracle,'' Lederer said.
   Defense lawyers summed up Tuesday, with one attorney suggesting
the victim was not gang-raped and another accusing detectives of
lying about how incriminating statements were obtained from the
three defendants. Those statements are the prosecution's chief
evidence.
   Referring to Salaam's contention that he was tricked into
confessing the crime, Lederer noted Salaam's confidence when he
testified.
   ``This is not a person who is manipulated. This not a person who
has words put in his mouth,'' Lederer said.
   She called Salaam's claim that he entered the park with a gang
of youths but spent his time there wandering around by himself
``absolutely incredible.''
   Lederer reminded the jury that in McCray's videotaped statement,
the youth freely offered information and corrected details the
police were trying to pin down.

   Heavily armed police in
armored vehicles today tried to restore order in the southeastern
city of Port Elizabeth after 23 people were reported killed in a
night of rioting and looting.
   Police said today at least five other people had been killed
Wednesday in different parts of the country.
   Hundreds of rioters stormed through Port Elizabeth on Wednesday
night, looting and attacking bystanders, police said.
   ``Criminal mobs ran amok ... looting and burning shops at random
and causing damage ... A baby was shot dead in its mother's lap,''
said local journalist Cliff Foster.
   Police spokesman Major Bill Dennis said 18 people were killed by
gunfire, but he did not have figures on how many of them were
killed by police. Police repeatedly opened fire with shotguns and
pistols to disperse the mob.
   Overall, police said 23 people were killed in Port Elizabeth.
   The rioters, who surged through parts of Port Elizabeth and
surrounding townships, destroyed and burned 23 shops, six houses,
two factories, one church and three schools, Dennis said.
   Police in armored vehicles patrolled the city's streets today to
try to restore order.
   In other unrest reported today, police said three people were
killed and 18 injured Wednesday night when workers attacked other
staff at President Steyn gold mine at Welkom in the Transvaal.
Police arrested 35 men.
   Anglo American Corp., which owns the mine, gave no reason for
the fighting, but it appeared to be black faction fighting.
   In Natal Province, police reported today two men had been killed
in black faction fighting on Wednesday.
   Police and residents in Port Elizabeth said they feared new
unrest could occur. Police reinforcements were being rushed to the
town to help exhausted local officers, police said.
   The rioting began Monday over a political dispute, but police
said criminals had taken advantage of the confusion to start
looting.
   One shopkeeper, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he and
his family hid in a garage for several hours to escape the mob.
``We heard windows breaking. We then watched the mob. They charged
across the road looting the shops. It was then we began to panic,''
the shopkeeper said.
   The man and his family escaped when a police armored vehicle
scattered the looters. They were able to follow it to safety.

   Iran, which fought a brutal eight-year
war with Iraq, today said that Tehran will not tolerate Baghdad's
annexation of Kuwait, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   A Foreign Ministry statement on IRNA condemned the Iraqi
takeover of its small, oil-rich neighbor and said the incursion
``has made the Persian Gulf region, the Middle East and the Islamic
world face an increasing crisis, making the future prospects for
this sensitive part of the world more ambiguous.''
   The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said the statement added
that ``as the major power of the Persian Gulf region, Iran will not
tolerate any alteration of the political geography of the region.''
   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, annexed it on Wednesday.
   The statement called for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, and said ``the situation
must come to an end as soon as possible,'' the news agency said.
   IRNA quoted an Iranian newspaper as saying today that Washington
had failed by sending troops to defend Saudi Arabia to adopt a
``clear-cut'' stand on Baghdad's aggression, which amounted to a
``tacit approval of the Iraqi invasion, or at last acceptance of
the invasion as a tolerable act.''
   The radical Farsi-language Jomhuri Islami added that the United
States was looking to use President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a
``scarecrow'' in the region to scare off anti-American Islamic
movements in the region.
   The newspaper was skeptical that international embargoes aimed
at strangling the Iraqi economy and forcing Saddam to retreat from
Kuwait would work. Therefore, ``regional regimes and sheiks of the
southern Persian Gulf in particular, must seriously contemplate
their future,'' the paper said.
   The more moderate English-language Tehran Times called the
international response to the invasion ``acceptable,'' but added
that ``only drastic action can adequately respond to the actions of
Baghdad's adventurism.''
   The newspaper, close to the Foreign Ministry which is known to
favor better relations with the United States, said such ``drastic
action should necessarily come from the United States.''
   The Times editorial was the first to encourage American military
action against Iraq. The Iranians had up until now urged a regional
solution to the problem, and vehemently condemned any foreign
intervention.
   Washington has disclosed it is seeking help from Iran and Syria,
two countries the United States has previously denounced for
encouraging terrorism, in forcing an Iraqi withdrawal.
   The Tehran Times did stress, however, that ``after the end of
the crisis such a force should leave the region and leave the
responsibility of peace and security of the region to the regional
countries.''
   But President Hashemi Rafsanjani's pro-Western inclinations
contrast sharply with those of his hard-line, vehemently
anti-American opponents. Rafsanjani's pragmatic government has been
locked in an increasing power struggle with radicals led by former
interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani's efforts at improving ties with the West have been
repeatedly frustrated by the hard-liners.

   Israel today launched the first test of a new
U.S.-financed missile developed to combat short-range ballistic
missiles, and state radio called it a direct response to an Iraqi
threat a day earlier.
   The radio report said the missile was launched at 3:40 p.m.
(8:40 a.m. EDT) at an undisclosed location. It left a short trail
of fire and underneath a small ring of smoke, said one of the
radio's reporters.
   Israel radio said the launch was a direct response to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's threat on Wednesday to launch a missile
attack on Israel. Saddam made the threat after alleging that
Israeli warplanes had been painted with American colors in
preparation for an attack on Iraq.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today said Saddam invited a
``heavy tragedy'' if he launched such a strike.
   Citing foreign reports, Israel radio said the missile is 12
yards long, has a range of 42 miles and can fly up to 18 miles
overhead.
   Today's missile launching was attended by officials from Israel
Aircraft Industries, which is developing the Arrow, and by American
representatives, the report said.

   Two men were charged with conspiring to
murder a neighbor they thought was a witch, authorities say.
   Karina Singer, 61, said she had no idea some of her neighbors
wrongly suspected she was a witch until two armed men were arrested
on her farm last week.
   ``I'm stunned my neighbors could believe these things when we've
lived here 21 years,'' Mrs. Singer said. ``And that instead of
calling me to find out if they were true, circulating them around
until they became like an atomic blast mushrooming out of the
prairie.''
   Jim Reppen, who works for a tire service company, and farmer
Dean Unterseher were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. The
charge carries a possible life term. Both were freed on $5,000 bond
after their arrests by police officers acting on a tip.
   Mercer County State's Attorney Alan Dupplier said rumors about
Mrs. Singer have circulated in the county for years. This summer,
they also included two visiting friends, he said.
   ``There have been rumors flying around Mercer County that these
three ladies are witches and they're sacrificing animals and doing
general cult-type of things,'' Dupplier said.
   The two arrested men, he said, apparently ``decided they were
going to go down and eliminate the problem.''
   A search of the Singer farm uncovered nothing witch-like,
Dupplier said.
   Mrs. Singer said she did not know the two men, who authorities
said hatched the alleged murder plot at a bar in nearby Hazen.
   Since the arrests, neighbors have told Mrs. Singer of hearing
stories of firelight rites at the farm.
   What really has been going on, Mrs. Singer said, was a plan she
developed with her late husband, John, to turn the farm into ``a
place of beauty and peace'' that friends could visit for extended
vacations. Her husband died of cancer in April.
   Last fall, the couple laid down two Indian ``medicine wheels,''
or rock configurations ``for the healing of the land.'' During the
spring and summer, several old frame buildings were torn down, a
pit was burned in the yard and a guest house was erected.
   But rumors circulated that the guest house was a church and that
visitors were seen dancing around a pit fire.
   The ``dancers,'' Mrs. Singer said, actually were workers from a
Hazen construction company that tore down the buildings and put out
grass fires started by sparks from the pit.
   All in all, she said, ``it was probably too fast a change'' for
the neighbors.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill awaiting President Bush's signature
would reverse a recent law denying unemployment benefits to
temporary census workers when their jobs end.
   Congress approved the provision providing the benefits to census
workers when it passed an unrelated trade bill last week in its
rush toward August recess. The House approved the bill early
Saturday, following Senate approval.
   The provision had been added by House and Senate conferees on
the trade bill as a way to reverse the exemption from jobless
benefits that Congress adopted as a cost-cutting move when it
passed an appropriations bill in May.
   It was intended to save an estimated $70 million set aside for
unemployment claims once the census workers lose their jobs.
   The law had set an April 20 cutoff for temporary census workers
to receive job credit toward later unemployment compensation. Work
after that date would not count when they eventually apply for
unemployment benefits.
   Repeal of the provision had been sought by Rep. Tom Downey,
D-N.Y., who said the census workers were being unfairly singled out
as a way to save money.

<TEXT>
   Lightning, strong winds and scorching temperatures fueled dozens
of fires in parched Oregon, Idaho and Utah, but scattered rain was
expected to cool off some areas next week.
   Four major forest fires in eastern Oregon _ including one that
scorched 80,000 acres and forced evacuations _ continued to grow
today and lightning sparked new blazes in the southwestern corner
of the state.
   In central Idaho, crews reined in a forest fire at Frank
Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area on Wednesday evening. But
a fire in southern Idaho advanced into the Sawtooth National
Forest, another was fanned by strong winds through sagebrush north
of Shoshone and timberland further north was hit by new
lightning-caused fires.
   The most dangerous fire in Oregon was the Pine Springs
combination of fires, including a blaze, which grew to about 80,000
acres overnight, fueled by winds up to 60 mph.
   It was within three miles today of the towns of Burns and Hines
in southeast Oregon and about 20 people were evacuated overnight
from Riley and nearby ranches after flames crept to the edge of
town, said Greg Thayer, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.
   They returned after the fire reversed course and no buildings
were damaged, he said.
   The fire was spreading through sage and juniper range land
today, he said.
   A fire 40 miles northwest of Burns on the Malheur National
Forest was at 7,600 acres, and another blaze 15 miles north of
Burns was reported at 3,500 acres, forcing the evacuation of a
campground.
   A fire 15 miles of Prairie City on the Malheur National Forest
was reported at 4,240 acres, while another burned 2,600 acres off
the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness Area southeast of John Day.
   ``All available (fire) crews are committed,'' said spokesman Don
Ferguson of the Oregon Multiple Agency Center in Salem. ``Air
support is in real short supply.''
   Ferguson said eight new fires were reported outside Medford in
the wake of a lightning storm Tuesday night that left 42 new fires
in the Klamath Basin. In the rest of the state, 19 small fires were
burning, but officials were hopeful they would be contained quickly.
   Terry Marsha, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said all
of Oregon is still vulnerable to lightning, but cool, wet weather
would help by early next week.
   In Idaho, Payette National Forest spokesman Dave Olson said
lightning sparked more than than 30 fires in the eastern part of
the forest Wednesday evening.
   ``Virtually every strike started a fire,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, in Utah, firefighters shored up the perimeter and
battled hot spots today on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation.
   The 5,350-acre fire is 80 percent contained. It has burned for
ten days through rugged wildlife habitat in the eastern Utah
reservation.

   The movement of tens of thousands of U.S.
soldiers, sailors and airmen to Saudi Arabia will take days to
accomplish and may last for months, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
says.
   Cheney described the deployment as ``a major commitment of U.S.
forces'' that included elements of the 82nd Airborne Division and
F-15 fighter jets.
   The breakthrough that paved the way for their deployment came
during a crucial, two-hour session between King Fahd and Cheney in
Jiddah on Monday night.
   ``The discussion ... was a significant moment,'' Cheney recalled
to reporters Wednesday.
   At President Bush's behest, Cheney had flown to Saudi Arabia,
armed with graphic descriptions provided by U.S. intelligence
agencies of Iraq's ``blitzkrieg'' drive through Kuwait and its
buildup of troops, tanks, artillery and surface-to-surface missiles.
   The Saudis had rejected many U.S. requests to base American
forces in the strategic country, the source for much of the world's
oil.
   However, this time ``it had become abundantly clear that the
Iraqis had, in fact, committed an act of infamy ... in their
aggression against Kuwait. Having told the Saudis they had no
intention to invade, they did in fact invade,'' Cheney said.
   ``The message was that preparation was the best way to deter
further aggression, and that if U.S. military assistance was
requested, we would stay only as long as the Saudis wanted us to,''
said a senior Pentagon official familiar with the talks.
   The king reminisced about his family's long ties with the United
States. But it was the realization of Iraq's ``naked aggression,''
coupled with Bush's personal diplomacy and Saudi Arabia's historic
ties to the United States, that convinced the royal ruler to
request U.S. military assistance, Cheney said.
   Military officials said Wednesday that U.S. warplanes and combat
troops, backed by an armada of Navy ships, had taken up defensive
positions in and near Saudi Arabia. Some Air National Guard members
in New York, New Jersey, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin
were called up for active duty.
   Cheney declined to provide a specific number of the troops
involved, citing security concerns. A senior military official in
the Pentagon said the deployment was ``open-ended'' and the numbers
of troops, airmen and sailors deployed would depend on Saddam's
reaction.
   Some Mideast diplomatic sources put the troop level at about
30,000 and several other estimates ranged even higher. On the first
day of deployment, at least 5,000 ground troops were being
dispatched, officials said, backed by an armada of air and
seapower. Another 4,000 Marines were moved close to the
Saudi-Kuwait border, diplomatic sources said.
   Nearly 40 warships and escort vessels _ some armed with
sophisticated cruise missiles programmed to destroy specific Iraqi
targets _ will be in Mideast waters by next week, the sources said.
   Squadrons of F-15 jet fighters from Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia were flown to the region, as were the 82nd Airborne's
Ready Brigade aboard huge transport planes.
   FB-111 fighter-bombers were in position at NATO bases in Turkey,
and B-52 bombersthat had arrived for long-planned exercises on the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia were held in position.
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said A-10 air-to-ground attack jets
from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C., had left for Saudi Arabia.
Unlike the F-15, an ``air superiority'' fighter designed to tangle
with other planes, the A-10 was designed to attack ground targets.
   The aircraft carriers Independence and Eisenhower were being
moved into position to do serious damage to Iraq's strategic sites.
   Pentagon sources said it would take several days for the troops
to converge on Saudi Arabia, but that the initial units would be in
place by early today.
   The length of their stay remains a question, Cheney said.
   ``The situation is uncertain. We don't know how long it will
last. We don't know when it will end,'' he said.
   ``We do not know how events will unfold over the next few
months, but obviously, the president had made it very clear that
... this is a part of the world that's of absolute strategic
significance to the United States and we are prepared to use U.S.
military forces, if necessary, to protect our interests and those
of our friends in the area,'' Cheney said.

   About 30 people gathered at the federal
courthouse to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia, contending that the move constitutes an unnecessary defense
of rich oil barons.
   Leaders of Wednesday's rally said it was the first in the nation
to question the most recent U.S. military moves.
   More were are scheduled today in Washington, D.C., New York, San
Francisco and other cities
   Sponsored by a group calling itself Women Against Military
Madness, protesters chanted ``Oil, Schmoil _ Ride your bike.''
   ``This seems kind of scary. It's not just protecting Saudi
Arabia, it seems bigger than that,'' said one protester, Jackie
Heine.
   The protesters say it's a conflict centered less on ideology
than crude oil.
   ``There's a moral question about defending rich Kuwaitis,'' said
Heine. ``It's important to have someone protesting so that people
realize something can happen because of this. A lot of people are
sleepers.''
   Protesters reject the U.S. government's assertions that the
troops are intended only to deter an Iraqi move on Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has scrapped
plans to move up all-German elections from Dec. 2 to Oct. 14,
officials said today.
   The decision followed a day-long parliamentary debate in which
the opposition Social Democrats made clear they would not let Kohl
have the two-thirds majority needed for a necessary constitutional
change.
   Kohl had originally planned elections for an all-German
parliament on Dec. 2. But last week East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere, after consultations with Kohl, said the date of
the elections and of formal German unity would be moved up to Oct.
14.
   It was not immediately clear what date Kohl has decided on for
formal German unity. The opposition Social Democrats want it to
occur on Sept. 15, with elections on Dec. 2.
   During a stormy Bundestag debate, lawmakers from Kohl's
governing coalition and his rivals charged each other with slowing
up the unity process and sowing uncertainty among the beleaguered
East German populace.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democrats, junior partner in
Kohl's coalition government, accused the Social Democrats of
``sinning against the people of the DDR (East Germany).''
   He maintained that holding elections in October rather than
December would ``improve the psychological situation (in East
Germany) and thereby create better frameworks for the (East German)
economy.''
   Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, a high-ranking Social Democrat, accused
Kohl's Christian Democrats of sowing ``uncertainty'' among East
Germans.
   During the West German parliamentary session today, lawmakers
postponed a key vote regulating the all-German election treaty. The
treaty lays the groundwork for the first pan-German elections since
1933.
   On Wednesday evening, East German lawmakers called for
all-German elections and unification on Oct. 14. But that vote does
little good without approval of a new election treaty.
   East Germany is suffering from fast-rising unemployment while it
shifts from 40 years of communism. Inefficient businesses exposed
to the free market have begun to fail or lay off excess workers.
   Economic unification began last month, with East Germany trading
in its currency for West German marks. But lower East German wages
have not kept up with the cost of living, and East Germans have
suffered from a loss of communist subsidies.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
assured Turkey today that it would receive full support from NATO
if it suffers for taking a ``forthright stand'' against Iraq.
   Baker and Turkish officials discussed ways in which the two
countries could cooperate ``to deter Iraqi agression.''
   However, he steered around the issue of whether the United
States would be able to use Turkish military bases as staging areas
for any operations in the Gulf.
   ``I don't plan to get into the specifics of any discussions we
might or might not have had on matters of defense cooperation,''
Baker told reporters before departing for Brussels, Belgium.
   He said they also discussed the economic hardships Turkey will
face in the loss of oil revenue by cutting off pipelines from Iraq.
   The ousted Kuwaiti leaders have offered ``to do what they can to
minimize those financial loses,'' Baker said.
   ``It goes without saying that Turkey is strategically very
important,'' Baker said earlier.
   He assured the Turks they would have the support of the NATO
alliance, of which Turkey is a member.
   Earlier, Baker disclosed that he dispatched John H. Kelly, the
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, to Damascus, Syria,
``to see if we can coordinate with the Syrians on collective
efforts regarding Iraqi aggression.''
   Kelly also will go to Saudi Arabia, where thousands of American
troops are being deployed to protect the oilfields, for talks with
Saudi officials and with Kuwaiti leaders who took sanctuary there
after Iraq overran their small country.
   Baker said before his meetings with Turkish officials that he
had received new assurances of Soviet support in enforcing the
economic boycott of Iraq ordered by the U.N. Security Council.
   Baker spoke for about a half hour by telephone from his U.S. Air
Force jetliner with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze _ their
third conversation in two days _ and then told reporters:
   ``They continue to support enforcement of the U.N. resolution.
We can look toward continued Soviet cooperation to carry out the
resolution.''
   Specifically, Baker said Moscow had dispatched naval forces to
the Persian Gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce
the sanctions approved unanimously Monday by the Security Council.
   ``The Soviets view this aggression in the same way that we do,''
Baker said.
   On Friday, he will meet in Brussels with Nikolai Afanasyevsky,
the Soviet ambassador to Belgium and to NATO.
   Baker's main purpose for going to NATO headquarters is to plot
with the 15 allied foreign ministers their ``possible participation
in military deployments'' to enforce the economic boycott of Iraq
voted unanimously Monday by the U.N. Security Council.
   Despite some reservations expressed privately by Moscow about
the economic boycott of Iraq and public disquiet about mounting a
military blockade, the cooperation between Washington and Moscow is
unprecedented in recent history.
   It is especially striking since Iraq has received a sizable
portion of its weapons from Moscow. Officials said the Kremlin
agreed to suspend further deliveries without hesitation.
   Baker's nine-hour visit to Ankara underscored both U.S.
gratitude for the actions Turkey has taken against Iraq, and the
additional demands that may be placed on NATO's only predominantly
Moslem member.
   Risking commerce with Iraq valued at $3 billion a year, Turkey
effectively ordered a shutdown Tuesday of Iraqi oil pipelines by
banning ships from loading Iraqi crude at offshore terminals in the
eastern Mediterranean.
   The pipelines carried more half of Iraq's total exports from its
northern fields. Turkey also banned trade with Iraq and froze $25
million in Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets.
   Baker has stressed Turkey's strategic situation. Besides sharing
a border with Iraq, there is concern in Ankara for an estimated
60,000 Turkish construction workers in Iraq.
   ``It is important that we make clear to them that they will
continue to enjoy the collective defense support that is afforded
to each and every member of the NATO alliance,'' he said.
   Probably the most dramatic step taken by the Bush
administration, however, was its willingness to solicit Syrian
participation in undercutting Iraq's Hussein.
   The enmity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments is intense.
Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saddam Hussein are longtime rivals
within the Arab world. The two countries are ruled by rival
Baathist parties, each considering the other outcasts.
   Baker declined to say what ``collective efforts'' Syria and the
United States might undertake against Iraq.
   ``I really don't want to get into the specifics of that,'' he
said.
   At the same time, Baker verified reports the United States also
has been in touch with Iran through ``third party contacts.''
   Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war in the Persian Gulf for a
decade. Iranian antipathy of Iraq may actually surpass Syria's and
is of much longer standing.
   A senior U.S. official, demanding anonymity, said it was up to
Saudi Arabia to decide whether Syria and Iran would participate in
defense of the country against Iraq.

   Britain today pledged to send jet fighters, a

forces dispatched to Saudi Arabia to deter Iraqi aggression.
   But as of today, Britain was the only other nation apart from
Saudi Arabia to pledge forces to the multinational force envisioned
by President Bush.
   The Soviet Union dispatched two warships to the Persian Gulf
``to protect Soviet maritime traffic,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yuri D. Gremitskikh said today. But Gremitskikh said the Soviet
Union would only consider participating in a multinational force or
naval blockade against Iraq if it were approved by the U.N.
Security Council.
   The U.N. Security Council today unanimously declared Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait to be ``null and void'' and called on all
nations to shun the government Baghdad installed in Kuwait. But
there was no indication that a vote on the multinational force
would be taken by the world body.
   Canada will decide whether to participate in a multinational
military blockade of Iraq following a meeting of NATO foreign
ministers in Brussels on Friday, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
Wednesday.
   Portugal, West Germany, Italy and Spain have offered the use of
bases.
   Egypt and Morocco _ considered the likeliest Arab participants
in a U.S.-led multinational force _ refused to join.
   A senior Turkish government official said Wednesday that Turkey
is unlikely to join a multinational force or commit itself to
allowing the United States to use the strategic NATO air base at
Incirlik for any military intervention in the Persian Gulf.
   Britain said it would send two squadrons of warplanes and a
number of ground-to-air missiles and to defend Saudi Arabia and
other gulf states, Defense Secretary Tom King said today. The
Defense Ministry said each squadron consisted of about 12 planes.
   King said Britain's contribution to the multinational effort
also included three mine sweepers, to be deployed initially to the
Eastern Mediterranean. The British destroyer HMS York is already in
the gulf, and two frigates are expected to arrive there this
weekend.
   Britain decided Wednesday to join the multinational force
following a formal request for British assistance from King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia.
   France, one of the few members of the 16-nation NATO alliance
with an appropriate military capability, said Wednesday that it had
not been asked by Saudi Arabia to send forces.
   France, which has two ships just outside the Persian Gulf and a
frigate with Exocet missiles en route, said French participation
was not envisaged at this stage in a multinational force.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said Wednesday that his country
had not sent troops but advocatged an Arab multinational force.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose forces invaded neighboring
Kuwait one week ago to touch off the crisis, has denied he intends
to invade Saudi Arabia. But Iraqi forces are reported massing on
the borders with Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
   The Portuguese Foreign Minister said late Wednesday that
Portugal has granted the United States use of the air base at Lajes
in the Azores islands in the mid-Atlantic in the build-up operation
of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia that began Wednesday.
   Portuguese news reports said six U.S. Air Force midair refueling
planes landed at the Lajes base on Wednesday. The base is shared by
Portuguese and U.S. forces.
   Italy has agreed to let bases be used to help facilitate
transport of troops and equipment and for logistical support, Prime
Minister Giulio Andreotti's office announced Wednesday.
   Spain, whose Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez opposes outside
intervention in the Persian Gulf, nonetheless agreed Wednesday to
allow the United States to use four jointly operated military bases
to support U.S. troops.
   Bonn signaled readiness Wednesday to allow the U.S. military to
use American facilities in West Germany as a ``basis for
operations'' for soldiers headed to Saudi Arabia.
   West Germany said Tuesday its constitution bars use of German
troops outside the country.
   Greece said Wednesday that nine U.S. support planes were granted
permission to pass through Greek airspace on their way to the
Persian Gulf.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that the
crisis in the Persian Gulf should be solved by gulf states and Arab
countries:
   ``The outside forces, especially the superpowers, should not be
involved in this matter. Otherwise, it will intensify the crisis.''
   Japan has expressed support for the U.S. decision to send troops
into Saudi Arabia as a defensive measure.

<TEXT>
   An ``art ambulance'' carrying coffins
containing once-banned books and paintings tours Boston
neighborhoods. A reproduction of Rodin's famous sculpture, ``The
Thinker,'' is covered daily with a shroud in San Francisco.
   A jazz funeral is held at the New Orleans Museum of Art. Curtain
speeches are given at New York Shakespeare Festival performances in
Central Park. Brochures mailed by the Virginia Symphony depict
Michelangelo's statue of David with the slogan ``Banned in the
U.S.A.?'' pasted over his genitals.
   Across the country this summer, the arts community is belatedly
mobilizing public support for the National Endowment for the Arts
in the escalating brouhaha over federal financing of controversial
art.
   Characteristically slow to anger, arts supporters have begun
striking back at conservative members of Congress and religious
fundamentalists who accuse the NEA of subsidizing obscene and
blasphemous art with taxpayers' funds.
   Concert audiences, theatergoers and visitors to museums and art
galleries are being recruited as foot soldiers in the arts
advocates' battle to protect the NEA from serious damage this fall
when Congress debates extending the life of the $171 million
federal arts agency.
   Pamphlets labeled ``Be Quiet and the Arts Will Just Go Away''
are being handed to theater patrons in Chicago, courtesy of the
Illinois Arts Alliance. Inside are cutout post cards urging
senators and House members to support the NEA, and this warning:
   ``A small faction of politicians and extreme right-wingers want
to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, which provides
government support for artists and arts institutions in the United
States. This minority is well organized and vocal. Their side is
winning.''
   In Baltimore, patrons of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra concerts,
Center Stage plays and Maryland Art Place exhibition openings are
asked to write members of Congress, sign petitions and dial a
special 900 telephone number appealing for a five-year extension of
the NEA, without any anti-obscenity restrictions on the grants it
awards.
   ``It's now time for us to stand up,'' said Philip Arnoult,
director of the Theater Project in Baltimore.
   The League of American Theaters and Producers in New York
published a pro-NEA editorial in Playbills that have reached an
estimated 1 million theatergoers. The Metropolitan Arts Commission
in Portland, Ore., working with Mayor Bud Clark, won the
endorsement of the U.S. Conference of Mayors for a letter to
Congress urging no-strings support for the endowment.
   Besides the ``art ambulance'' and a multimedia ``Caravan for
Freedom of Expression'' van that has toured Boston neighborhoods,
arts supporters there have circulated a ``Declaration of Cultural
Rights'' that opposes what they view as threatened government
censorship of the arts.
   A full-page advertisement in the Boston Globe last month,
featuring a once-controversial John Singer Sargent portrait of a
woman with a plunging neckline, resulted in 1,000 calls urging
members of Congress to support the NEA, the ad's sponsors said.
   An estimated 5,000 patrons of San Francisco Bay Area bookstores
signed letters petitioning Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., to vote
against anti-obscenity curbs on the endowment. Rodin's ``The
Thinker'' was shrouded for an hour every day during a 12-day
``Festival for Freedom of Expression'' in San Francisco that was
backed by more than 200 arts organizations.
   Bob Lynch, director of the non-profit National Association of
Local Arts Agencies, said his organization's 900-number campaign
has yielded an estimated 100,000 mailgrams and perhaps a
half-million personal calls and letters to Capitol Hill in support
of the endowment.
   Although the NEA's conservative critics are heavily financed,
Lynch said, ``we will ultimately win because it is becoming clear
that Americans recognize the value of the arts and the endowment,
and are not people who respond blindly to the other side's appeals
to `stop sin'.''
   The House has agreed to begin debate on the arts endowment's
fate in September, when it will consider Republican-led proposals
to restrict the agency's grant-making authority, shift the bulk of
its grant money to state control or abolish the NEA altogether.
   ``Time is of the essence,'' said Anne Murphy, executive director
of the non-profit American Arts Alliance, a national arts advocacy
coalition. ``Every individual who calls, writes or meets personally
with a member of Congress really does help.''

   Iraq has started beefing up its forces
along the border with Turkey, a news agency reported today, two
days after Turkey effectively shut down pipelines carrying Iraqi
oil through its territory.
   However, Turkey's defense minister, Safa Giray, denied the
report, telling The Associated Press: ``We have received no
intelligence indicating Iraq has added to troops already deployed
in the area.''
   Giray also denied Turkish news reports that Turkey has increased
its military readiness by moving some air force fighter planes to
bases close to the border with Iraq. But he said the government has
canceled the leaves of all high level-military officials and the
vacations of civilian officials.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency, which quoted villagers
on the Iraqi side of the border, said the Iraqi reinforcements
included armored units.
   Anatolia, which did not say how large the Iraqi force was, said
about 1,500 Turkish sentries had been sent to border guard stations
that had been unmanned since last year when a cease-fire took
effect in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq's ambassador to Greece, Abdel Fetah al-Khazreji, also told
reporters in Athens today there was no buildup of Iraqi forces on
the border with Turkey.
   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed it on
Wednesday, has reportedly massed tens of thousands of troops along
Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, prompting fears that Baghdad
will invade Saudi Arabia.
   The United States has sent thousands of troops into Saudi Arabia
to defend it against a possible attack, and nation's around the
world have imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in an effort to force
it to pullout of Kuwait.
   As part of that effort, Turkey effectively ordered a shutdown
Tuesday of pipelines carrying Iraqi oil through its territory by
banning ships from loading Iraqi crude at offshore terminals in the
eastern Mediterranean.
   The pipelines carried more half of Iraq's total exports from its
northern fields. Turkey also banned trade with Iraq and froze $25
million in Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is visiting Ankara,
today assured Turkey it would receive full support from NATO if it
becomes a target of Iraqi intimidation for taking a ``forthright
stand'' against Baghdad.

   The New Testament of the Christian Bible has been
translated into Mongolian for the first time, and 5,000 copies are
printed and awaiting distribution, the United Bible Societies said.
   The translator is a 45-year-old Englishman, John Gibbens, who
became interested in the project when he visited the communist
Mongolian People's Republic in 1972. He spent 18 years on his
self-appointed task.
   Gibbens was helped by his Mongolian wife, Altaa, whom he met on
his second visit in 1978. He is now working on a Mongolian
translation of the Old Testament, Steven Downey, information
officer for the United Bible Societies, said Wednesday. The
societies coordinate worldwide Bible translation, publishing and
distribution.
   Mongolia is officially atheist, and Downey said it is believed
to have fewer than a dozen Christians. But with growing political
freedom there has been a resurgence of interest in the traditional
Buddhist religion inside the country.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo, a central figure during a
tumultuous period in the airline industry and the bane of organized
labor, announced today he was getting out of the business.
   Lorenzo's Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. said he was selling
most of his stake in the company, formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., to Scandinavian Airlines System. He also will quit as
chairman and chief executive but will walk away with nearly $30
million in severance payments and sale proceeds.
   Lorenzo told reporters at a New York news briefing that he
decided to resign partly because the barrage of negative publicity
about his management practices was hurting the company's overall
performance.
   ``It's been obvious to me that I've become a lightning rod for
many of the attacks the company's taken,'' Lorenzo said. ``This
transaction allows me to step aside.''
   His departure marks the end of an era in the U.S. airline
industry, which has undergone sweeping changes since deregulation
more than a decade ago.
   Using billions of dollars in borrowed money, cheap fares and
bankruptcy laws to restructure high-cost airlines Continental and
Eastern, Lorenzo expanded his company to the nation's biggest
airline operator with about 20 percent of the domestic market.
   But Lorenzo has been bitterly criticized by airline unions,
which were driven from Continental and waged a bitter strike at
Eastern.
   Both airlines are under extreme financial pressure, and doubts
are widespread about Eastern's ability to survive.
   Lorenzo, 50, said he will be replaced as chief executive by
Hollis L. Harris, president of rival Delta Airlines. He called
Harris ``one of the industry's most experienced and highly regarded
executives.''
   Delta confirmed today that Harris, 58, left the company,
effective Wednesday, to assume a position with Continental. Delta
said Ronald W. Allen, its chairman, would take on Harris' duties.
   Lorenzo will immediately get about $17.13 million in cash. He
also will get $2.7 million over three years and $10 million from
SAS for his stake in Continental. But the $29.8 million total is
still only a franction of what he was worth a few years ago when
his airlines were in better shape.
   SAS, which first bought a stake in Lorenzo's business a few
years ago, said it was spending $50 million on the transaction,
which already was approved by Continental Holdings' board of
directors.
   Lorenzo became one of the most despised figures among union
groups in the 1980s because of what they called his brutal
treatment of organized labor.
   The most dramatic result: a strike at Eastern Airlines in March
1989 that prompted the carrier to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection from creditors while it reorganized.
   Lorenzo lost control of Eastern in April when federal bankruptcy
judge Judge Burton Lifland placed the airline in the hands of a
trustee, Martin Shugrue.
   Following that move, Lorenzo's company changed its name from
Texas Air to Continental Airlines Holdings, borrowing the name of
the airline that Lorenzo acquired in 1982 and continues to run.
   The sale of Lorenzo's stake would boost SAS's interest in
Continental Holdings to 16.8 percent in terms of equity and 18.4
percent in terms of voting control. SAS already holds 9.8 percent
of Continental Holdings and has a seat on the board.
   The transaction will require approval of the U.S. Department of
Transportation. It does not appear to violate laws limiting foreign
carriers to no more than a 25 percent stake in a U.S. airline.

   The truck smashed through a line of people waiting for a bus

<HEAD>Armenian President Says Soviet Troops Won't Disarm Militants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin has agreed to let Armenian authorities
try to disarm thousands of militants in the republic and will not
resort to sending in troops, the new president of Armenia said
Thursday.
   Levon Ter-Petrosyan also said it is time to ``expand state
sovereignty'' of his republic, and he said he is ready to negotiate
with neighboring Azerbaijan over the bitter dispute involving
control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Ter-Petrosyan said he
had ``positive'' talks with Soviet KGB and Interior Ministry chiefs
Wednesday about thousands of Armenian National Army volunteers
defying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's order to turn in their
weapons and disband.
   Gorbachev had threatened to send in Soviet Army and Interior
Ministry troops to forcibly disarm militants if they did not turn
in their weapons by Thursday.
   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin had suggested the
deadline be extended. Neither Ter-Petrosyan nor Bakatin, who spoke
in a Tass interview, defined the new deadline.
   Ter-Petrosyan also dismissed Kremlin estimates of up to 160,000
members in the Armenian National Army as ``grossly exaggerated,''
saying there are ``not more than 5,000.''
   The 45-year-old nationalist, once jailed by the Soviets for
organizing demonstrations over Nagorno-Karabakh, was elected
Armenian president on Saturday. He said he agreed with Moscow that
Armenian authorities will carry out Gorbachev's order to disarm
militants.
   ``As regards the deadlines, we talked about the fact that I am a
new leader of the republic and I cannot be held responsible for the
sins of the previous leadership,'' Ter-Petrosyan told reporters,
speaking in a pink marble hall at the Armenian government mission
in Moscow.
   ``But there was quite clear agreement it (the decree) will be
implemented by our own means, without any interference from the
Soviet Army or the Interior (Ministry) troops,'' he said.
   Bakatin told Tass that Armenia's new leaders agreed on ``the
need to strengthen law and order, protect citizens and rule out the
unlawful bearing of arms.''
   Gorbachev, trying to quell violence in this ethnically diverse
nation, on July 26 gave militants across the Soviet Union 15 days
to turn in their weapons.
   Many militants, especially those in Armenia, have refused to
comply. Armenia's parliament, which this week is considering a
declaration of independence, rejected Gorbachev's decree as
interference.
   Although no specific republic was mentioned in the decree, it
clearly was aimed chiefly at Armenia.
   Ter-Petrosyan said he had a ``warm conversation'' with the
vacationing Gorbachev by telephone this week.
   ``He expressed his readiness to cooperate with the new
leadership ... hence, my visit to Moscow,'' said Ter-Petrosyan, who
also met with KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and Soviet Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Ter-Petrosyan told reporters the main goal for Armenia is ``to
expand state sovereignty and radically democratize social life.''
   He also said it is possible for Armenia to have good-neighborly
relations with its traditional enemies _ the Moslem Azerbaijanis,
Turks, and Iran.
   Ter-Petrosyan said he is ready to open talks with Azerbaijan
over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian enclave that is part of
Azerbaijan. He said ``there is a basis for compromise.''
   ``The first step to be taken, which will satisfy both sides, is
to restore Soviet power and operation of Soviet laws in Karabakh,''
he said. ``That is the only territory in the Soviet Union where
there is no Soviet power. It is an occupied land, ruled by the
army.''
   Ter-Petrosyan also said he and Bakatin agreed that the state of
emergency in Nagorno-Karabakh will be eased.
   Ethnic battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over who
should control the mountainous region have killed more than 200
people in the past two years.
   He said his administration's priorities are settling the
Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, restoring the area devastated by the Dec.
7, 1988, Armenian earthquake, and easing the plight of the
thousands of Armenian refugees fleeing ethnic unrest.

   The Justice Department filed suit under the
Voting Rights Act today challenging Georgia's runoff election
system that requires candidates to receive a majority of the vote
to win an election.
   The law, similar to legislation in eight other Southern states,
gives ``white candidates an extraordinary power,'' said John R.
Dunne, assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights.
   The law has stymied black candidates who may win the most votes
in a three-way race with two white candidates but can't gain a
majority in the ensuing two-way runoff.
   Dunne said the law has had ``a demonstratively chilling effect
on the intent and willingness of blacks to become candidates for
office'' across the South.
   The other states with similar runoff systems are: Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South
Carolina, and Texas.
   Georgia's majority vote law requires a runoff election in every
state, local and federal election in which a candidate does not
receive a majority of the vote.
   The suit, filed in Atlanta, is the first challenge of a majority
vote runoff system brought by the Justice Department under the 1965
Voting Rights Act.
   Perry Michael, assistant state attorney general, said Georgia
officials only learned of the suit today and would not comment
until they have reviewed it.
   Dunne said the lawsuit was similar to one filed earlier in
Georgia by state Rep. Tyrone Brooks. But unlike the Brooks suit, he
said, the Justice Department action does not seek to invalidate the
entire runoff law.
   Dunne said the Justice suit would challenge only those elections
in which the majority vote requirement has been used to dilute the
voting strength of minorities. That would include all statewide
elections and many local elections where blacks comprise a majority
of the voting population but have been unable to elect black
candidates.
   Although 24 percent of Georgia's voting age population is black,
Dunne said blacks hold fewer than 10 percent of elected offices in
the state, and most of those are at the local level.
   ``The higher the office and the broader the constituency, the
smaller the number of black elected officials,'' he said.
   Dunne said the department waited until after Georgia's Tuesday
runoff election in the Democratic primary for governor to file the
suit so the action could not be interpreted as a challenge to those
results.

   Arab leaders gathered today for a high-stakes summit that
brought together envoys from conquering Iraq and the ruler of
vanquished Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council rejected Baghdad's
annexation of the emirate.
   The fate of thousands of foreigners trapped by Iraq's lightning
invasion of Kuwait one week ago became even more uncertain today,
as Iraq sealed its borders to all foreigners except diplomats.
   Thousands of American troops poured into Saudi Arabia today and
reportedly took up positions within seven miles from the Iraqi
border, and Iraq's envoy to the Cairo summit denounced ``overt U.S.
threats to the Arab nation.''
   The troops were sent to protect Saudi Arabia. Iraq has promised
not to invade it _ but it had said the same thing about Kuwait,
which it annexed Wednesday, six days after the invasion.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, in his first public comment on the
invasion, today called it ``the most horrible aggression'' in the
Arab world's modern history.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today visited another of
Iraq's neighbors, Turkey, and assured officials of full support
from NATO if Turkey, too, becomes a target of Iraqi intimidation.
   Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency today quoted
villagers on the Iraqi side of the border with Turkey as saying
Iraq has started beefing up its forces along the frontier. Turkey's
defense minister denied the report, which comes two days after
Turkey effectively shut down pipelines carrying Iraqi oil.
   On the economic front, delegates from industrialized nations
gathered in Paris today to assess the impact of the international
boycott against Iraq, imposed to punish Baghdad for the invasion.
Iraq is the world's second-largest crude exporter after Saudi
Arabia.
   In other developments today:
   _To solidify what it called its merger with Kuwait, Iraq today
appointed the head of Kuwait's Iraq-installed government a deputy
prime minister of Iraq, and canceled Baghdad's multibillion-dollar
debt to Kuwait.
   _Israel today launched the first test of a new missile developed
to combat short-range ballistic missiles. Israel radio said it was
a direct response to an Iraqi threat a day earlier.
   _Iran, which fought a bloody eight-year war with Iraq, today
warned that Tehran ``will not tolerate'' Baghdad's annexation of
Kuwait. A Foreign Ministry statement quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said the Iraqi takeover brought on a
``crisis'' in the region.
   _Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo today amid pessimism about how
the Middle East crisis will affect the economy of Japan, which
relies on imports for virtually all its oil needs. But stock prices
rolled forward in London in a recovery triggered in part by Wall
Street's strength a day earlier.
   Two top Iraqi officials were in Cairo for the emergency Arab
summit: Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's first deputy premier and a
member of the ruling military junta, and Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz. Ramadan said he was attending the summit ``to confront the
overt U.S. threats to the Arab nation.''
   ``U.S. land, naval and air forces have taken up positions on
Arab territories and waters to attack Iraq,'' he told reporters in
Baghdad before leaving for Cairo. His comments were distributed by
the Iraqi News Agency.
   Arab diplomatic sources had said the absence of Saddam or key
aides from the summit would dim the chances of effective action by
the Arab heads of state.
   Kuwait's deposed emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, also
arrived today to take Kuwait's seat at the summit. Egypt and most
Arab states recognize the ousted government as the legitimate ruler
of Kuwait.
   Arab nations were initially slow to denounce the invasion, and
have been reluctant to join in the U.S.-led multinational military
effort. Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, instead suggested an
all-Arab deterrent force.
   But the lone Arab member on the U.N. Security Council _ Yemen _
joined in the 15-0 vote declaring Iraq's annexation of Kuwait
``null and void.''
   The resolution calls upon all states and international
organizations not to recognize the annexation and not to take any
action that might be interpreted as inderect recognition of the
annexation.
   The Saudis and other oil producers including Venezuela, Mexico,
Iran and Nigeria have indicated they will pump more crude to make
up for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti production, which experts say
totaled 4 million barrels daily before the crisis.
   Oil prices, which had shot up at the onset of the crisis, began
dropping.
   In Paris, delegates from industrialized nations said there was
no immediate danger to world oil supplies.
   ``Presently there is not a significant shortfall of crude oil in
the market,'' said U.S. Assistant Energy Secretary John Easton as
the 21-nation International Energy Agency opened an emergency
meeting today.
   President Bush is deploying thousands of troops and scores of
warplanes in the Saudi desert and has send three aircraft carrier
groups to the region. Iraq has an estimated 100,000 troops just
across the border in Kuwait _ but the Americans have superior air
and sea power.
   Diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said U.S.
Marines arrived early today near Khafji, a coastal city seven miles
south of the Kuwaiti border that includes an oil terminal.
   Bush declined to discuss the size of the U.S. military force.
But government sources said Wednesday at least 5,000 ground troops
were en route or already taking up positions on Saudi soil, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers.
   Diplomatic sources said the U.S. force buildup would total at
least 40,000 troops. Several other estimates ranged up to 50,000.
In addition, a formidable U.S. naval fleet is gathering in and
around the Gulf and the Mediterranean.
   Travellers from the Khafji border point said Saudi troops in the
area confronting the Iraqi-occupied Kuwait were buttressing their
own positions continuously with missiles, tanks and armor.
   So far, Britain is the only nation to commit troops to the
U.S.-led effort, though other countries have offered support such
as use of bases. Britain said today it would send two squadrons of
warplanes and a number of ground-to-air missiles, along with three
mine sweepers, to be deployed initially to the Eastern
Mediterranean.
   The British destroyer HMS York is already in the Persian Gulf,
and two frigates are expected to arrive there this weekend.
   Bush promised severe retaliation if Saddam used chemical weapons
against American soldiers. Saddam used the arms against Iran during
the countries' 8-year war and also against Iraq's rebellious
Kurdish minority.
   Iraq's envoy to Greece suggested today that Iraq is prepared to
use chemical weapons if attacked.
   ``If we are attacked by a foreign power we will retaliate with
all sorts of defensive weapons that we have,'' the ambassador,
Abdel Fetah al-Khazreji, said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts End Six-Month Mission With Rich Payload</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by
technical problems and a perilous spacewalk returned to Earth on
Thursday with a multimillion-ruble payload of space-grown crystals.
   The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin landed on the Central Asian steppes at 11:34 a.m., one
minute ahead of schedule.
   The landing was not broadcast live on Soviet television. But the
midday ``Vremya'' TV news program showed the cosmonauts waving
goodbye to their replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space
station Mir.
   ``Back in the landing spaceship, we felt the slightly bitter
smell of absinthe in the Kazakh steppe,'' Solovyev told reporters
after landing and ending his six-month stay in space.
   ``I also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh delicious
apples when I was back on Earth,'' he said in remarks carried by
the Tass news agency.
   Solovyev and Balandin were launched into space Feb. 11 in what
was trumpeted as the first manned mission in the 33-year history of
the Soviet space program to turn a multimillion-dollar profit.
   They conducted hundreds of experiments, photographed 8.4 million
square miles of the Earth's surface and grew 23 pure crystals for
semiconductors and computer chips, Tass said.
   Tass said they also studied the influence of space flight on the
development and behavior of birds, and that this would help develop
life-support systems for future manned spacecraft.
   Crystals grown in the zero-gravity environment of space tend to
have far fewer imperfections, such as ripples or other impurites,
than those produced on Earth. The crystals are sliced into thin
sheets and etched to create tiny circuits, or semiconductors, with
optimum conductivity.
   Tass said each of the 23 crystals grown on the Mir station was
worth $1 million, but the news agency did not say how big the
crystals were or what material they were grown from.
   A $23 million profit from the space venture likely would help
the cash-hungry Soviet government fend off criticism about the cost
of its space program.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressure has grown on the
costly, but once sacrosanct, space program to prove its worth in a
society where many people do not have decent housing or enough
quality food to eat.
   Future expeditions to Mir will carry paying passengers. The
first will be an employee of the Tokyo Broadcasting System, who
will have a seat on an eight-day mission beginning Dec. 2.
   The Japanese passenger will return to Earth with the two
cosmonauts currently aboard Mir, Gennady Manakov and Gennady
Strekalov.
   Manakov and Strekalov, who replaced Solovyev and Balandin,
docked with the space station Aug. 3, two days after blasting off
from the Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan.
   They will conduct an estimated 250 experiments over the next six
months, including growing more crystals and making two spacewalks.
   Solovyev and Balandin made a life-threatening spacewalk July 17
to repair their capsule's thermal insulation, which was torn on
takeoff. The repairs took seven hours, longer than anticipated, and
their life-support supplies nearly ran out.
   Having damaged the exit-and-entry hatch at the beginning of the
spacewalk, the cosmonauts were forced to return through an
emergency porthole. In their haste, they left behind handrails
attached to the exterior of the capsule.
   A second spacewalk was required July 26 to retrieve the
handrails and fix the hatch.

Fahd's television address as translated by the The Associated Press:

   In the name of God the beneficent, the merciful.
   Brother citizens, God's peace, mercy and blessings be upon you.
   No doubt you know, by following the sudden and regrettable
events in the Arabian Gulf region during the past few days, the
extent of the dangerous situation confronted by the Arab nation
under the present circumstances.
   No doubt you know that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted
all it could in efforts and attempts with each of the governments
of the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait to contain the
dispute that developed between the two countries, and I undertook
in this connection a number of telephone contacts and brotherly
talks. As a result, a bilateral meeting of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
delegations was hosted by the kingdom in the attempts to heal the
rift and prevent an escalation of matters.
   Some of the brothers, kings and heads of state of the Arab
states, contributed vastly and commendably to this end, impelled by
faith in the unity of the Arab nation and bolster its march toward
solidarity and cooperation in a way that achieves complete success
in these matters of destiny.
   But, most regrettably, matters took a course contrary to what
we, the Islamic and Arab nations and the entire peace-loving world,
were seeking.
   The painful and regrettable events developed as of the dawn of
Aug. 2 in a manner that took the entire world by surprise _ when
the Iraqi forces overran sister Kuwait in the most horrible
aggression the Arab nation has known in its modern history. This
rendered the people of Kuwait homeless and afflicted them with
insufferable pains.
   The kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its deep denunciation of
the the aggression on sister state Kuwait and declares its
categoric rejection of all the measures and announcements that
followed the assault. Likewise, statements from Arab leaderships,
the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Conference and the
Gulf Cooperation Council, and all Arab and international
organizations and authorities rejected them.
   The kingdom of Saudi Arabia affirms its demand that the
situation in the sister state of Kuwait be restored to what it was
before the Iraqi invasion and the return of the ruling family led
by His Highness Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir and his
government.
   We hope that the emergency Arab summit called by President Hosni
Mubarak of sister Egypt will achieve the aspirations of the Arab
nation and bolster its march toward solidarity and unity.
   Following that regrettable event, Iraq ventured to amass large
numbers of troops on the border of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Faced with this bitter reality and out of the kingdom's keenness
to safeguard its territory and protect its vital and economic
potential, and desirous of bolstering its defensive potential and
enhance the level of training for its armed forces, and out of its
interest in peace and non-resort to arms in settling differences,
the kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its desire for the
participation of sister Arab forces and other friends.
   The governments of the United States of America and Britain and
other states hastened by virtue of the bonds of friendship between
the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and these states to send air and land
troops to help the Saudi armed forces perform their duty in defense
of the homeland and the nation against any aggression, while
affirming that this measure is not directed against any one but is
a purely defensive measure dictated by the circumstances that the
kingdom of Saudi Arabia is confronting.
   It is worth noting that these forces will participate in joint
exercises with the Saudi armed forces and their presence on Saudi
territory will be temporary. They will leave here as soon as the
kingdom so demands. We ask God to guide our steps for the good of
our faith, and the safety of our lands.
   God's peace, mercy and blessing be upon you.

   Here are some facts on the Arab League and
its members' positions on the Iraq-Kuwait controversy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Arab League was founded in 1945. Summit
conferences as an instrument of policy began in 1964. Because of
frequent inter-Arab bickering, there have been more emergency
summits than regular ones.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MEMBERSHIP _ The league had 22 members until May, when the
merger of North Yemen and South Yemen lowered membership to 21.
They are Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and
the Palestine Liberation Organization, now officially listed as
Palestine.

   POSITION ON IRAQ-KUWAIT CRISIS _ Member foreign ministers,
meeting as the Arab League Council, gathered in Cairo on Aug. 3 to
consider Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Fourteen members voted for a
resolution condemning the invasion and urging immediate Iraqi
withdrawal and restoration of the overthrown Kuwait government.
   By Egyptian government count, the 14 were: Algeria, Bahrain,
Djibouti, Egypt, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, Syria, Tunisia and the UAE.
   Against were Jordan, the PLO, Sudan and Yemen. Iraq and Kuwait
had no right to vote on the issue. Libya was absent.
   Those who opposed the resolution argued that condemnation of
Iraq would undermine Arab efforts to achieve a peaceful solution.
Despite their dissent, the league accepted Egypt's call for an
emergency summit. Libya also accepted.

   The White House issued a fresh call today for
other nations to join the United States in a military buildup to
defend Saudi Arabia from possible attack by Iraq. More U.S. forces
arrived in the Persian Gulf, and the Pentagon said Iraq was beefing
up its forces in Kuwait.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said an estimated 120,000 Iraqi
troops are now in Kuwait and that Iraq also had improved air
defenses in Kuwait as part of what appeared to be defensive
measures.
   ``They're holding on to what they have acquired,'' Williams said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush ``is
very satisfied with the course of events in the last 24 hours.'' He
declined to criticize Egypt or other Arab nations for failing to
join the United States and Britain in the defense of Saudi Arabia.
   `The United States acted in the interest of our country and
other Western nations,'' Fitzwater said. ``We would always like to
see others participate but the organization of that is up to the
Saudis.''
   Fitzwater said the Gulf Cooperation Council countries _ Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as well as Saudi Arabia _
have a 3,000-member force in Saudi Arabia.
   The Pentagon declined to detail the size of the U.S. deployment,
but Williams did say all F-15 fighters sent to Saudi Arabia had
arrived, as have five AWACs planes. Six U.S. ships are in the
Mediterranean and two aircraft carrier groups are positioned in the
Red and Arabian seas, he said.
   Fitzwater told a White House briefing that Bush would exempt the
military operation from mandatory spending cuts that could be
triggered if the president and Congress do not reach agreement on
cutting the federal deficit.
   The Middle East crisis notwithstanding, Bush planned to leave
Washington on Friday for a 25-day vacation at his oceanfront home
in Maine. Bush likely will return to the White House for a day or
so next week for military briefings, Fitzwater said.
   The Bush administration has urged Americans to leave Iraq and
Kuwait, but Fitzwater said Iraq's borders remain closed and only
diplomats are being allowed to leave. The State Department said
Iraq turned over a 10-year-old girl, Penelope Nabokov of Albany,
Calif., to U.S. diplomats in Baghdad but kept 38 other Americans
confined to a hotel under armed guard.
   By air and sea, additional U.S. troops and equipment headed for
the Saudi kingdom and elsewhere in the gulf region. Diplomatic
sources in Saudi Arabia said U.S. troops arrived today near Khafji,
a coastal oil city seven miles south of the Kuwaiti border. The
Saudi sources had identified the troops as U.S. Marines but the
Pentagon today said no Marines are among the forces deployed in
Saudi Arabia.
   Even more troops still on U.S. soil were placed on alert for
possible Mideast duty and Air National Guard members in a handful
of states were activated.
   At the United Nations, the Security Council voted 15-0 to
declare Iraq's annexation of Kuwait ``null and void.'' The U.S.
ambassador to the forum, Thomas Pickering, said ``the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait and the large military presence on the Saudi
frontier creates grave risk of further aggression in the area.''
   Fitzwater characterized the vote as ``one more block to the
growing international foundation of condemnation.''
   The president's actions are winning broad support in Congress,
but concerns were raised today about the lack of clear support from
other Arab nations.
   ``If it appears that it's the United States and Saudi Arabia
versus the rest of the Arab world, then that is not going to be in
our longterm interest or Saudi Arabia's interest,'' Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said.
   While expressing support for the deployment, Nunn cautioned that
``a longterm, protracted presence of 50,000 to 100,000 people is in
my view not desirable either militarily or certainly
psychologically or politically in that part of the world.''
   Hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis rested largely on
a gathering of Arab leaders in Egypt. But a summit meeting planned
for today was postponed until Friday.
   The effort to win regional support for its campaign against
Iraq's Saddam Hussein has the United States sounding out unlikely
partners _ including Iran, Syria and the Soviet Union. Also,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in Turkey today for
consultations with its leaders, and told them the deposed Kuwaiti
leadership had promised to help Turkey make up for revenues it
expects to lose because it shut down two pipelines that carry Iraqi
oil.
   Bush himself was out of the public eye this morning. On
Wednesday, he expressed optimism that the worldwide economic
pressure would force Saddam to abandon his conquest of Kuwait and
his threatening military position on the Saudi border.
   ``There are some indications that he's already beginning to feel
the pinch,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``Nobody can stand up
forever to total economic deprivation.''
   The stakes are high. Saudi Arabia provided 7 percent of U.S. oil
last year. Bush is counting on increased production from the Saudis
and other oil producers to make up for the loss of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti supplies.
   ``A line has been drawn in the sand,'' Bush declared as U.S.
warplanes and ground forces arrived in Saudi Arabia. However, he
said, ``We're not in a war.''
   Top U.S. military officials refused to reveal the size of the
president's commitment to Saudi defense, but some Middle East
diplomatic sources put the troop level at about 30,000. Other
estimates ranged up to 50,000. Those totals would include ground
and air forces as well as sailors aboard ships in the region. On
the first day of deployment, at least 5,000 ground troops were
being dispatched, officials said, backed by an armada of air and
seapower.
   No one was guessing how long they would be away from home.
   ``The situation's uncertain. We don't know how long it will
last. We don't know when it will end,'' Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said.
   Baker told reporters the Soviet Union sent naval forces to the
Persian Gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce a
United Nations trade embargo following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
last week.
   Baker also dispatched an aide to Syria ``to see if we can
coordinate'' and added the United States has been in touch with
Iran ``through third party contacts.''
   Both nations are bitter foes of Iraq. But Syria is on the
official State Department list of states supporting terrorism, and
Iran has long been accused of pulling the strings behind the
holders of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Bush said U.S. forces would safeguard the Saudi oilfields but
would not attempt to drive Iraqi troops from tiny Kuwait.
   Bush warned Saddam not to use his arsenal of chemical weapons,
saying that ``would be dealt with very, very severely.'' U.S.
troops were equipped with medical supplies and protective clothing
to counter a chemical weapon attack.
   Bush explained why he ordered the largest military deployment
since the Vietnam war, saying America imports half its oil and
``could face a major threat to its economic independence'' if
Saddam took over the oilfields of the Persian Gulf.
   Military sources said the U.S. contingent included 140 jet
fighters and bombers as well as battleships that carried 32
Tomahawk Cruise missiles programmed to destroy specific targets in
Iraq.
   ``You can be sure that for the mission we have been given we
will put in adequate forces,'' Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon briefing.
   He expressed confidence that American forces were prepared for
battle in the hostile, desert environment if called upon.
   ``We've trained for it, we've exercised in it,'' Powell said. He
said the battle-hardened Iraqis ``are not invincible. They are not
10 feet tall.''

   The Soviet Union refused Thursday to join a
U.S.-led multinational force to stem Iraqi aggression but said it
might go along if the United Nations organized a similar operation.
   ``At this stage we do not consider the possibility of
participating in either the international force or naval
blockade,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri D. Gremitskikh told
reporters.
   He coupled the Soviet restraint with a fresh demand that Iraq
restore the ``sovereignty, national independence and territorial
integrity of the state of Kuwait.'' Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The Soviet determination to refrain from military involvement
showed how stringently the Kremlin was sticking to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``new thinking'' in foreign
affairs. That policy, which calls for non-violent means of settling
conflicts and respect for other nations' positions, has been most
evident in the Soviet decisions to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan and to refrain from force to keep communist regimes in
place in Eastern Europe.
   In another development, the Soviet Union's point man in
diplomatic contacts over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Belonogov, met Thursday in Moscow with
representatives of Warsaw Pact nations, Tass reported. The news
agency said Belonogov and Yuri Kvitsinsky, another deputy foreign
minister, told the representatives about Soviet efforts to resolve
the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The Soviet people began speaking out publicly, as well, and
state television aired a panel discussion by political commentators
about the situation.
   ``We Warn: The Danger of Neo-Nazism. Hitler Began the Same
Way,'' read posters bearing a picture of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and displayed at a demonstration outside Iraq's embassy in
Moscow. About 100 people took part in the protest and burned the
posters.
   Stanislav Kondrashov, an analyst for the government newspaper
Izvestia, said in the TV discussion that the Soviet Union is
joining a worldwide boycott of Iraqi oil. The Soviet Union, a major
oil producer, received Iraqi oil as payment for goods, then passed
the crude on to Bulgaria and India, Kondrashov said.
   Alexei Vassilev, deputy director of the Soviet Institute of
Africa, said on the TV program the Soviet Union would benefit
financially overall because the Iraqi crisis had driven up oil
prices, including those of Soviet crude.
   Gremitskikh told a news briefing that Gorbachev had contacted
Saddam by telegram, hoping to persuade the Iraqi leader to adhere
to the U.N. Security Council resolution to withdraw from Kuwait,
Gremitskikh said. ``Unfortunately our hopes were not fulfilled,''
he said.
   He signaled the Soviets have no intention of sending troops into
Saudi Arabia, as the United States has done.
   ``The Soviet position is that the settlement in connection with
the Iraqi invasion into Kuwait must be coordinated within the
(U.N.) Security Council,'' Gremitskikh said.
   If the United Nations approved a multinational force or naval
blockade ``then we would think about it and would take our own
sovereign decision about what to do,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union has taken some protective military action,
however.
   The spokesman said two Soviet warships, a destroyer and an
anti-submarine vessel, were dispatched from the Indian Ocean to the
Persian Gulf ``to protect Soviet maritime traffic.''
   Gremitskikh said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze spoke
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III by telephone twice
Wednesday and received assurance the American-led troops massing in
Saudi Arabia would leave as soon as tensions eased.
   Baker told reporters traveling with him to Turkey that he spoke
to Shevardnadze again Thursday. He quoted the Soviet minister as
saying Moscow had dispatched its warships to the gulf for use in
any international blockade.
   Gremitskikh would not elaborate on their conversation.
   He read a Foreign Ministry statement that shied away from direct
criticism of the U.S.-led multinational force but appeared to be
referring to the operation when it called for prevention of
``actions that may pour oil on the flames.''
   ``The experience of many years shows that the most correct and
sensible way of acting in conflict situations is through collective
efforts and the utmost use of U.N. mechanisms,'' the statement said.
   Gremitskikh said the Soviet Union, which had been Iraq's main
arms supplier, has a special responsibility for ending the crisis.
Moscow suspended all arms sales to Baghdad shortly after the
invasion.

   The U.N. Security Council today
unanimously declared Iraq's annexation of Kuwait to be ``null and
void'' and called on all nations to shun the government Baghdad
installed in Kuwait.
   The vote was 15-0 on the council, which met for the third time
in one week to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to support the
ousted government. The majority included the council's only Arab
member, Yemen.
   Iraq's ambassador, Amir al-Anbari, rejected the resolution,
telling the council: ``My government reaffirms the unity between
Iraq and Kuwait is an indestructible one. It is eternal and
irreversible.''
   Al-Anbari denounced the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia,
saying it is responsible for instability.
   He said his government ``respects the territorial integrity of
all neighboring Arab states, including the brotherly country of
Saudi Arabia.''
   The Soviet delegate, Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinskiy, told the
council his government opposes use of force and unilateral
decisions and favors U.N. solutions to resolve such conflicts.
   The resolution says, ``Annexation of Kuwait by Iraq under any
form and whatever pretext has no legal validity, and is considered
null and void.''
   It calls upon all states and international organizations not to
recognize the annexation and not to take any action that might be
interpreted as inderect recognition of the annexation.
   It ``demands that Iraq rescind its actions purporting to annex
Kuwait.''
   The resolution repeats its demand that Iraq withdraw immediately
and unconditionally.
   It also says it is determined to bring the occupaion of Kuwait
to an end and restore the nation's sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity.
   The resolution says the council is determined to restore the
authority of the legitimate government of Kuwait.
   On Monday, the Security Council voted 13-0 with two abstentions
to order a worldwide economic boycott of Iraq. Hours after Iraq
invaded Kuwait last week, the Security Council unanimously
condemned Iraq and demanded that it withdraw.
   Yemen abstained from both earlier resolutions. Cuba abstained
from the call for an economic boycott.
   The council includes the five permanent members: The United
States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union and 10 other
members: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast,
Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.
   The Security Council handles issues relating to international
peace and security. Its resolutions are legally binding on all U.N.
members, although past council resolutions have often been ignored
or flouted.
   The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism.

   In a dramatic response to an Iraqi threat,
Israel on Thursday launched the first test of a new anti-ballistic
missile. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned of ``heavy tragedy''
for any nation attacking Israel.
   The launch of the U.S.-financed Arrow missile came a day after
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to start a missile attack
on Israel. Saddam made the threat after alleging that Israeli
warplanes had been painted with American colors in preparation for
an attack on Iraq.
   Observers said the timing of the launch was a clear signal to
Saddam _ who in April threatened to burn half of Israel with
chemical weapons if attacked _ that Israel is a power to reckon
with.
   The Arrow left a trail of fire and smoke and shot many miles up
and westward in less than a minute, then fell in an arc into the
Mediterranean, witnesses said.
   The Arrow was developed to combat the short-range ballistic
missiles of the kind possessed by Iran. Washington provided 80
percent of the $158 million cost of the first phase of the project.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens praised the Arrow as an important
technological achievement but noted it was only a ``developing
program at this stage.'' It is not expected to be operational until
at least 1992.
   Shamir assured Arab countries Israel had no aggressive plans,
but added: ``Whoever plots to attack Israel must know that Israel
has the capability, will and readiness to defend its security
absolutely, and whoever tries to hurt it is liable to bring on
himself a heavy tragedy.''
   ``Israel's defense and security forces are aware and alert and
devoting their efforts to prevent any danger to the people and
state,'' Shamir told Israel radio.
   Several Israeli analysts said Saddam may attack Israel in a
frustrated response to a U.S. military move.
   ``What he is actually saying to the Americans is ... `I'm going
to consider any military confrontation between Iraq and America as
an Iraqi-American-Israeli confrontation,''' said Amatzia Baram, an
Iraq expert at Haifa University. ```I cannot reach America, I don't
have missiles that reach that far, but I can reach Israel. So you
ought to know that if you launch an attack against me I'm going to
press the button.'''
   The atmosphere of anxiety was reflected in newspaper editorials
that called for distribution of gas masks to defend the population
against a possible assault by chemical weapons.
   ``We don't have to panic, but is this not the time to calmly and
quietly open our anti-chemical warfare arsenals that are intended
for distribution to the people?'' Yediot Ahronot wrote.
   The army has decided in principle to distribute the masks to the
entire population over the next six months, army officials said. In
two locations, the army carried out test distribution 18 months ago.
   ``The government can give us means of defense. We don't have to
be afraid,'' said 11-year-old Roi Samuel of Ramat Hasharon. He told
Israel radio he keeps a government-supplied gas mask in his closet.

   Weary Mel Gibson, squeezing his last ounce of
energy for interviews promoting his new film ``Air America,'' is
taking a year off.
   After his fourth movie without a break, the warrior has tired of
the road.
   ``It gets to a point where your work suffers. I've got to go
away and learn some new tricks. I've got to replenish my creative
energy because I'm out of it,'' he said in an interview this week.
   Gibson said he reached the burnout stage near the end of filming
the fourth movie, ``Hamlet,'' in which he co-stars with Glenn Close.
   ``Frankly, I didn't think I'd make it to the end of the movie. I
simply ran out of gas, and when that happens it's a good idea to
just go away for awhile,'' said the star, who gained fame in ``Road
Warrior.''
   Gibson's other recent films include ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and
``Bird on a Wire.'' He doesn't think the vacation will hurt his
career.
   ``I don't pay much attention to that movie star stuff. And I
don't pay much attention to that king of the hill stuff, either,''
Gibson said.

   Ronald Reagan says even he was taken aback by
the $2 million the Japanese paid him to make two speeches, but he
doesn't consider it improper.
   ``I didn't have a fee; it was their offer,'' the former
president said in the Aug. 12 issue of Parade Magazine. ``But I
have to say this: Yes, it sounds a little out of line, even to me,
that that much money was offered.
   ``But it wasn't cashing in on the presidency. If I'd been of a
nature to cash in, I would have returned to the industry that I
left,'' he said. ``I'm quite sure that there would have been some
healthy fees offered me if I agreed to play a part in the movies.''
   The 79-year-old Reagan said he plays golf once a week with actor
friend Tom Selleck and has added four inches to his chest since
leaving the White House.
   He's also started going to church, saying he has ``great faith
in the man upstairs.''
   ``What really ended church for me was when the Secret Service
said that, with all the terrorism existing at the time, it wouldn't
be just another assassination attempt against me, but that I could
be responsible for a lot of deaths from a terrorist bomb. ...
   ``I missed it very much. But now I'm going to church again.''

   British ice skating champion Christopher Dean
announced his engagement Thursday to French Canadian skater
Isabelle Duchesnay.
   Dean, 32, met his 26-year-old fiancee nine years ago and has
helped choreograph some of her skating routines. He proposed to her
last week in Germany, where she is training for the 1992 Olympics.
   No wedding date has been set.
   ``There's a bit of a bug at the minute with everyone getting
married -- we've all joined the same club,'' Dean said.
   Dean's skating partner, Jayne Torvill last month disclosed her
engagement to Phil Christensen, a 35-year-old American sound
engineer. They met when he worked on the Torvill and Dean tour of
the United States last year.
   Torvill and Dean won a gold medal in the 1984 Olympics for
Britain.

   Irish singer Sinead O'Connor is suffering
from an undiagnosed illness that may cause her to cancel dates on
her U.S. tour, a publicist said Thursday.
   Concert-goers booed Tuesday after O'Connor cut short her
performance by one song at the Star Lake Amphitheater in Washington
County west of Pittsburgh.
   ``She's got to take it easy,'' publicist Elaine Schock said in a
telephone interview from Pelham, N.Y. ``She wasn't feeling well,
but went through the set anyway and cut the encore. That's not all
that uncommon.''
   About 6,100 people attended the show, paying $20.25 for tickets.
   O'Connor's recent single ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' and album ``I
Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' topped Billboard magazine's charts
in both those categories.

   Charlotte Burnett acknowledges her transfer
three years ago to head a bank in Watts was not exactly the career
move she had in mind.
   After all, for many Watts is the definition of urban blight and
racial unrest, the community after which the Watts riot of 25 years
ago was named. California Federal's Watts branch is on 103rd
Street, once known as Charcoal Alley.
   But running the only bank in the Los Angeles community of Watts
proved a rewarding experience and greatly changed Burnett's view of
the community and its potential for the future.
   ``What I have found is that what I see on television and in the
newspaper about the community is basically not very true or the
whole picture,'' she said. ``I see a difference. I always see the
negative (in the media). I see the positive here.''
   Burnett is among a dedicated core of business people and
community activists working to turn Watts around.
   From her vantage point as a bank vice president, Burnett sees
the other side of Watts, the working people, the families, and
retirees who overwhelmingly outnumber the drug dealers and school
dropouts who always seem to make the news.
   Many of the people in Watts have lived there for 40 or more
years in homes from the 1940s with neat lawns and freshly painted
fences on tree-lined streets, many blocks away from the housing
projects and vacant lots.
   The CalFed branch, which opened in 1970, symbolizes for many
residents Watt's rebound from the riot of 1965 and offers an
example of where the community can go.
   The branch employs 13 people, 10 of them from Watts, and handles
a wide variety of services, from checking to mutual funds.
   As a local business person, Burnett often has duties outside the
office, from giving investment seminars to working on community
advisory programs.
   ``I see people who have pride in their community, (an attitude
of) we're going to make this work. It's going to be as good a
community as any other community,'' she said. ``But most important
thing is I see families, the pictures they (media) never show of
the mother, the father and the children. I see it every day.''

<HEAD>Saudi King Says Military Help Only Temporary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd, in his first address to
the nation since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, said Thursday his
decision to seek foreign military help was a defensive move forced
by the Iraqi aggression.
   It was the first time the Saudi government had explained to its
people the arrival of tens of thousands of American troops.
   Fahd called the takeover of neighboring Kuwait ``the most
horrible aggression the Arab nation has known in its modern
history'' and said his request for foreign military help was aimed
at restoring peace to the region.
   Fahd demanded that in addition to an Iraqi troop pullout, the
al-Sabah royal family return to power in Kuwait.
   Following the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Iraqis ``massed
large numbers of troops on the border of the kingdom,'' Fahd said.
   ``Faced with this bitter reality, and out of keenness to
safeguard its territory and economy ... the kingdom expressed a
desire to Arab and friendly forces to participate'' in the defense
task, he said.
   The king spoke as U.S. airborne rapid deployment forces and
fighter jets poured into Saudi Arabia.
   An official statement later distributed by the Saudi Press
Agency said the troop buildup was to be completed Friday.
   It expressed the kingdom's ``deep appreciation'' to all states
that were sending troops. Their involvement reflected ``keenness to
see security and stability prevail in the Arabian Gulf region until
normal conditions are restored as well as the legitimate authority
in the sister state of Kuwait, and all consequences of the Iraqi
invasion, are eliminated.''
   Diplomatic sources noted this would coincide with the emergency
Arab summit being held in Cairo. The summit was expected to take up
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposal to line up a pan-Arab
force, which would replace the Iraqi occupation troops inside
Kuwait until the differences over land, oil and money that sparked
the invasion could be settled.
   Referring to the foreign troops in Saudi territory, the king
said: ``These forces from friendly powers are here temporarily.''
   ``They are to help defend the kingdom, participate in joint
exercises, and will leave here as soon as the kingdom so demands,''
he said.
   Fahd stressed that inviting Western and Arab forces to the
kingdom was ``not directed against anyone, but a purely defensive
measure.''
   The landing of the thousands of foreign troops has been cloaked
from ordinary Saudis, since they were being deployed at the
northeastern desert edge of the kingdom.
   The area is known as Hafr al-Baten, where one of the world's
biggest military cities was completed in 1985. The city can
accommodate up to 70,000 officers and soldiers, aside from
dependents.
   A 10,000-strong fledgling rapid deployment force from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and the other four partners in the Gulf Copperation
Council alliance _ Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates _ is also based at Hafr al-Baten.
   ``We feel them but we don't see them,'' said a resident reached
by telephone in the vital oil center of the Eastern Province, where
the troops were headed.
   Aside from a run on newspapers and portable radios, residents
went about their lives, remaining mainly indoors as usual as the
summer temperatures soared to about 100 degrees.
   There has been no panic or mass evacuation of the estimated 4.5
million foreign workers and their dependents in the kingdom. But
some foreigners, especially dependents, were leaving if their stay
was not necessary.
   Many workers from the Indian subcontinent were lined up seeking
visas.
   Regional shipping executives and the London-based Lloyd's
shipping intelligence unit, which monitors the maritime navigations
of the Persian Gulf, said that Saudi Gulf ports of Dammam, Ras
Tanura, Juaymah and Jubail were operating normally.

   Iraq's massive war machine is largely a ground
force whose true military capabilities are less than its size and
armament would suggest, according to U.S. analysts.
   While President Saddam Hussein's 5,500 tanks and million-man
army are the Arab world's largest force, and the world's
fourth-largest military, the United States believes they can be
kept at bay and eventually starved by a much smaller contingent
that relies on air and sea power.
   It is true that an eight-year war with Iran that ended in 1988,
and a $34 billion military buildup over that period, left Iraq with
hardened, battle-tested forces. But a conflict over Saudi Arabia
would be of a far different character, and much of that experience
might be less relevant, according to U.S. officials.
   ``We treat them and view them as a capable military force,''
said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
``But they are not invincible and they're not 10 feet tall.''
   Against Iran, Iraqi troops became adept at building massive
earthworks, constructing tank traps and flooding land as a defense
against the human waves sent by the Ayatollah Khomeini. They
learned to move elite units quickly to hot spots along the border
and developed an extensive fleet of armored troop transports.
   Iraq also acquired SCUD missiles, a relatively clumsy
ground-to-ground weapon, from the Soviet Union, and improved their
range with help from private engineers in the West. And Saddam has
developed an independent capacity to make mustard gas and nerve
gas, and deliver them in artillery shells and on missiles.
   On paper, Iraq also has a substantial air force and formidable
defenses against possible sorties by U.S. fighters and bombers. But
the numbers lie, said one congressional military expert.
   ``Except for about 50 of them, Iraqi pilots are third-rate,''
said the source, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The
fifty pilots went through a three-year training course in France as
part of Iraq's purchase of French Mirage fighter planes.
   Some of those planes are equipped with French Exocet missiles,
one of which hit the USS Stark and killed 37 sailors.
   It was those four fighter squadrons which carried out the most
effective raids during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran, attacking
oil-loading facilities at Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf, said
the source.
   While the air force includes 450 other combat planes, some of
them Soviet MiGs, they have not been a threat. ``The pilots are
chicken and not very imaginative,'' said the source. Bombing runs
on Tehran during the war were carried out from 30,000 feet because
of fear of antiaircraft fire and did little damage, the analyst
said.
   The Iraqis have more than 300 surface-to-air missiles, which
could be used against American pilots, but are said to be
unprepared to use them. There was little need for air defense in
the war with Iran, so skilled personnel were not committed to those
areas.
   The Iraqi navy is almost non-existent, which is why military
strategists see a naval blockade to starve Saddam into submission
as a leading option. The Iraqi leader can deploy only five ships of
any size, and his primary waterway to the Persian Gulf remains
choked with the wreckage of ships sunk during the war with Iran.
   Even Saddam's million-man ground force is not as formidable as
it appears. Fully half of those troops are reserves, less well
equipped and minimally trained. Some forces must be kept to watch
the country's borders with Iran and Turkey.
   The elite Republican Guard, seven divisions numbering about
120,000 men, are the most experienced and are all positioned in
Kuwait. Any reinforcements would have to come from what one expert
called ``second-rate troops.''
   And even the elite units are not experienced in sustained
combat, the analyst said. The Iran-Iraq war was made up of a series
of short skirmishes, with only two or three major battles a year.
The longest conflict was less than two weeks.

   Arab leaders gathered in Cairo today for a high-stakes summit on
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait but put off formal talks for one day, and
the United Nations Security Council refused to recognize Baghdad's
annexation of the emirate.
   The Arab summit had been scheduled to start today, but the
leaders instead held preparatory talks while waiting for more
participants to arrive, President Hosni Mubarak's press secretary,
Mohamed Abdel-Moneim, said.
   Those on hand included top-level envoys from Iraq and the
deposed emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who wept
upon arrival when an Egyptian military band played the Kuwait
national anthem in his honor.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, who set the crisis in motion,
was not attending the Cairo gathering.
   The fate of thousands of foreigners trapped by Iraq's lightning
invasion of Kuwait one week ago became even more uncertain today,
as Iraq sealed its borders to all foreigners except diplomats.
Britain's Foreign Office announced the move by Baghdad and said it
assumed Iraqi frontiers now included annexed Kuwait.
   Thousands of American troops poured into Saudi Arabia today and
reportedly took up positions within seven miles from the Iraqi
border. Iraq's envoy to the Cairo summit denounced the deployment
as ``overt U.S. threats to the Arab nation.''
   The troops were sent to protect Saudi Arabia. Iraq has promised
not to invade it _ but it had said the same thing about Kuwait,
which it annexed Wednesday, six days after the invasion.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, in his first public comment on the
invasion, today called it ``the most horrible aggression'' in the
Arab world's modern history.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today visited another of
Iraq's neighbors, Turkey, and assured officials of full support
from NATO if Turkey, too, becomes a target of Iraqi intimidation.
   Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency today quoted
villagers on the Iraqi side of the border with Turkey as saying
Iraq has started beefing up its forces along the frontier. Turkey's
defense minister denied the report, which comes two days after
Turkey effectively shut down pipelines carrying Iraqi oil.
   On the economic front, delegates from industrialized nations
gathered in Paris today to assess the impact of the international
boycott against Iraq, imposed to punish Baghdad for the invasion.
Iraq is the world's second-largest crude exporter after Saudi
Arabia.
   In other developments today:
   _The Pentagon said an estimated 120,000 Iraqi troops are now in
Kuwait and that Iraq also had improved air defenses in the emirate.
``They're holding on to what they have acquired,'' spokesman Pete
Williams said.
   _The White House made a new call for other nations to join the
multinational military effort, but refused to criticize Arab
nations for failing to join in.
   _President Francois Mitterrand said today that France will beef
up its naval and air forces in the Persian Gulf and send war
materials and technicians to the gulf as requested by Saudi Arabia
and other states.
   _To solidify what it called its merger with Kuwait, Iraq
appointed the head of Kuwait's Iraq-installed government a deputy
prime minister of Iraq, and canceled Baghdad's multibillion-dollar
debt to Kuwait.
   _Israel today launched the first test of a new missile developed
to combat short-range ballistic missiles. Israel radio said it was
a direct response to an Iraqi threat a day earlier.
   _Iran, which fought a bloody eight-year war with Iraq, today
warned that Tehran ``will not tolerate'' Baghdad's annexation of
Kuwait. A Foreign Ministry statement quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said the Iraqi takeover brought on a
``crisis'' in the region.
   _Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo today amid pessimism about how
the Middle East crisis will affect the economy of Japan, which
relies on imports for virtually all its oil needs. But stock prices
rolled forward in London in a recovery triggered in part by Wall
Street's strength a day earlier.
   Two top Iraqi officials were in Cairo for the emergency Arab
summit: Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's first deputy premier and a
member of the ruling military junta, and Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz. Ramadan said he was attending the summit ``to confront the
overt U.S. threats to the Arab nation.''
   ``U.S. land, naval and air forces have taken up positions on
Arab territories and waters to attack Iraq,'' he told reporters in
Baghdad before leaving for Cairo. His comments were distributed by
the Iraqi News Agency.
   Arab diplomatic sources had said the absence of Saddam or key
aides from the summit would dim the chances of effective action by
the Arab heads of state.
   Kuwait's deposed emir also arrived today to take Kuwait's seat
at the summit. Egypt and most Arab states recognize the ousted
government as the legitimate ruler of Kuwait.
   Arab nations were initially slow to denounce the invasion, and
have been reluctant to join in the U.S.-led multinational military
effort. Mubarak instead suggested an all-Arab deterrent force.
   But the lone Arab member on the U.N. Security Council _ Yemen _
joined in the 15-0 vote declaring Iraq's annexation of Kuwait
``null and void.''
   The resolution calls upon all states and international
organizations not to recognize the annexation and not to take any
action that might be interpreted as indirect recognition of the
annexation.
   Oil prices, which had shot up at the onset of the crisis, began
dropping, and in Paris, delegates from industrialized nations said
there was no immediate danger to world oil supplies.
   ``Presently there is not a significant shortfall of crude oil in
the market,'' said U.S. Assistant Energy Secretary John Easton as
the 21-nation International Energy Agency opened an emergency
meeting today.
   President Bush is deploying thousands of troops and scores of
warplanes in the Saudi desert and has send three aircraft carrier
groups to the region. Iraq has an estimated 100,000 troops just
across the border in Kuwait _ but the Americans have superior air
and sea power.
   Diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said U.S.
forces arrived early today near Khafji, a coastal city seven miles
south of the Kuwaiti border that includes an oil terminal.
   Government sources said Wednesday at least 5,000 ground troops
were en route or already taking up positions on Saudi soil, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers.
   Diplomatic sources said the U.S. force buildup would total at
least 40,000 troops. Several other estimates ranged up to 50,000.
In addition, a formidable U.S. naval fleet is gathering in and
around the Gulf and the Mediterranean.
   So far, Britain is the only nation to commit troops to the
U.S.-led effort, though other countries have offered support such
as use of bases. Britain said today it would send two squadrons of
warplanes and a number of ground-to-air missiles, along with three
mine sweepers, to be deployed initially to the Eastern
Mediterranean.
   The British destroyer HMS York is already in the Persian Gulf,
and two frigates are expected to arrive there this weekend.
   Bush promised severe retaliation if Saddam used chemical weapons
against American soldiers. Saddam used the arms against Iran during
the countries' 8-year war and also against Iraq's rebellious
Kurdish minority.
   Iraq's envoy to Greece suggested today that Iraq is prepared to
use chemical weapons if attacked.
   ``If we are attacked by a foreign power we will retaliate with
all sorts of defensive weapons that we have,'' the ambassador,
Abdel Fetah al-Khazreji, said in a telephone interview.

   An emergency Arab summit to discuss Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait was postponed one day until Friday because some
Arab leaders did not arrive in time, President Hosni Mubarak's
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Mohamed Abdel-Moneim, said Mubarak would host a
dinner tonight for Arab presidents and kings who already had
arrived and who had expected the summit to begin today.
   Of the 21 Arab League countries, Tunisia, Mauritania, Yemen and
Djibouti had not sent delegations by the scheduled early evening
opening time.
   Egypt hopes the summit will forestall a Western military attack
on Iraqi forces in Kuwait and along its border with Saudi Arabia.
Both Iraq and Kuwait's ousted government have sent representatives
to the meeting.
   ``The emergency Arab summit will start tomorrow, Friday,''
Egypt's Middle Eastern News Agency said. ``Today will be limited to
side talks among the kings and presidents participating in the
summit. They will meet tonight (at the dinner) until the rest of
the delegations arrive...later Thursday.''
   Iraq's presence at the meeting could be a breakthrough for
moderate Arab leaders who have refused to join a U.S.-led force
that was deployed to defend Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   The moderates hope for a diplomatic solution.
   The Iraqi delegation chief, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said he was
attending the summit ``to confront the overt U.S. threats.'' He
said U.S. forces ``have taken up positions on Arab territories and
waters to attack Iraq.''
   Ramadan, first deputy premier and member of President Saddam
Hussein's ruling military junta, warned against an attack on his
country by the United States, which is building up forces in
neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   ``Any aggression on Iraq, regardless of its source, will be
answered decisively,'' Ramadan said. ``And when Iraq says
something, it is capable of following it through.''
   He spoke before his departure from Baghdad and his comments were
distributed by the Iraqi News Agency.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait a week ago and annexed it Wednesday. The
U.N. Security Council today declared the annexation ``null and
void.''
   Kuwait's deposed emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, also
arrived today to take Kuwait's seat at the summit. Egypt and most
Arab states recognize the ousted government as the legitimate ruler
of Kuwait.
   ``I find myself obliged to warn of the extreme danger,''
Mubarak, the summit host, said Wednesday.
   He called for a joint Arab force that would keep the Iraqis from
taking more territory, specifically Saudi Arabia. Such a force
would be unlikely to be used to try to push Iraqi troops from
Kuwait.
   Finding an Arab solution ``would be better than having a
solution forced on us by foreign powers,'' Mubarak said in a
nationally televised speech.
   ``I appeal to President Saddam and the Iraqi leadership to
respond to the idea of an Arab umbrella, withdraw its forces from
Kuwait, restore legitimacy, then there would be no objection to a
joint Arab force serving as a buffer between the two sides. Then
negotiations can follow,'' Mubarak said.
   U.S. officials had said Egypt would join the United States in a
multinational force defending the Saudis from Iraqi aggression; but
Egypt said it would not participate in an American-led force.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one
of the summit's options was to support Mubarak's idea of a joint
Arab deterrent force.
   Their other main alternative would be to join the world in
imposing sanctions on Iraq, hoping the seige would force Iraq to
withdraw. The very least they will do is reiterate their
condemnation of the incursion and urge Western powers not to
intervene, the diplomatic sources said.
   President Bush, seeking to dispel fears of an impending U.S.
attack against Iraqi forces, said in Washington on Wednesday that
U.S. forces being sent to Saudi Arabia were aimed only at
preventing an Iraqi incursion.
   Jordan's King Hussein was asked at an Amman news conference on
Wednesday if the summit was the last opportunity to avoid fighting.
He responded without hesitation: ``Yes, I see it as a last chance.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was the first Arab leader to
arrive for the summit. He was greeted Wednesday at Cairo
International Airport by Mubarak, who later welcomed Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi.
   Those arriving today included leaders of Algeria, Bahrain,
Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates as
well as Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   Senior officials attended from Morocco and Oman.

<HEAD>Report: Navy Fleet Maintenance Costs Higher Than Projected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of maintaining and overhauling the
nation's naval fleet exceeded original estimates by about 30
percent with expenses rising to $3.7 billion over a three-year
period, congressional investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office, the watchdog agency of Congress,
found cost growth and schedule overruns at the eight public
shipyards and 44 private shipyards across the United States between
fiscal 1985 and fiscal 1988.
   Public shipyards generally work on more sophisticated ships,
including submarines, carriers and nuclear-powered surface ships.
Private shipyards usually handle auxiliary and amphibious ships.
   The GAO blamed the problems at private shipyards on an inability
to determine beforehand what repair work must be done, unplanned
work added after the government contract has been awarded and
difficulty in obtaining materials.
   In the study, released the end of July, the GAO also found that
the market for ship maintenance and modernization is highly
competitive, forcing contractors to submit low bids to obtain Navy
work.
   Similar problems also existed at public shipyards, where the GAO
found that in some cases the companies did not have enough labor to
do the work properly.
   At the private shipyards, the GAO said that over a three-year
period, contract costs increased from $2.8 billion to $3.7 billion
with the final prices exceeding the contract award prices on 357 of
402 projects.
   The cost increase at public shipyards was about 3 percent as
estimates rose from $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion over the same
three-year period.
   Completion dates for the projects at the private shipyards
overran the original schedules by an average of 43 days, while at
the public shipyards, completion dates overran the original
schedules by an average of 81 days.
   ``The Navy is aware of the problems, but past efforts to correct
them have not been fully successful, as evidenced by the continued
cost growth and schedule overruns,'' the GAO said.
   ``A new plan to correct depot maintenance problems was recently
approved by the Secretary of the Navy (Lawrence Garrett III). This
plan is a step in the right direction, but more corrective actions
are needed.''
   In comments included in the GAO report, the Defense Department
largely concurs with the GAO findings, but cites a number of
unusual reasons for the cost increases.
   ``Schedule overruns at public shipyards for the last four years
are directly attributable to an unusually high number of submarine
overhaul starts, beginning in the fiscal 1985 to fiscal 1998 time
frame, which created a serious imbalance between workload and
shipyard trade and management skills,'' the department said.
   Both the GAO and the department note that since the early 1970s,
the Navy has changed its strategy for maintaining and modernizing
ships by scheduling fewer regular overhauls and opting for
``shorter, more frequent,'' repairs.
   The GAO report was requested by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee.

<HEAD>Commercial Real Estate Woes Spreading, Fed Member Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weak commercial real estate markets have
spread from the Northeast and Southwest to the Midwest and even the
booming West Coast, a Federal Reserve Board member said Thursday.
   Real estate problems have been most pronounced in New England,
John P. LaWare told the House Banking Committee, but weakness now
exists along much of the East Coast.
   ``Market conditions in some Midwestern cities have also begun to
show a marked loss of strength, and even the western states of
California, Oregon and Washington, long the beneficiaries of strong
real estate markets, have begun to report increased office vacancy
rates in at least some areas,'' he said.
   As a result, the number of delinquent real estate loans at
commercial banks are mounting, up 37 percent in 1989 and 8 percent
to $32 billion in the first three months of 1990, he said.
   However, LaWare and Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.
Clarke, whose office oversees nationally chartered banks, said
regulators were on top of the trend and insisting on sound lending
standards.
   The comptroller's office ``has been sounding the alarm on real
estate lending for the past three years,'' Clarke said.
   Members of the committee reacted skeptically, likening the
deterioration in bank profits and the regulators' reactions to the
early phases of the savings and loan mess.
   ``During the '60s, '70s and '80s, the regulators said pretty
much what you're saying today,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, chairman of the panel.
   ``I'm worried,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Some of the
very same fundamentals that caused problems in the S&amp;L industry are
going to continue to cause problems in the banking industry until
we examine it and change the way ... banks operate.''
   However, private analysts appearing before the panel said that
banks' position, while serious, cannot be compared with that of
savings institutions.
   ``U.S. commercial banks are in varying degrees under
considerable strain,'' said James J. McDermott Jr. of Keefe,
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. ``Nevertheless ... banks in the aggregate
should avoid the plight of the savings and loan industry and manage
their way through the current stresses.''
   Gonzalez also rebuked the regulators for refusing to answer
questions about $2 billion in bank loans to Donald Trump, who is
struggling to preserve his real estate empire.
   ``The savings and loan scandals grew in the dark basements of
official government secrecy and the facts did not reach the
American public until the problems became massive and
unmanageable,'' Gonzalez said, asking how depositors were to know
where to put their money.
   Clarke replied that there was a longstanding regulatory
tradition to keep information about bank customers confidential.
   ``I think it would be a terrible mistake for bank supervisors to
come up here and present financial information about individual
bank borrowers in a public forum,'' he said.
   Trump and representatives of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank,
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp.
all declined invitations to address the committee. Trump, in a
letter to Gonzalez, said he did not want to reveal proprietary
business information and the bankers said they were obligated to
preserve customer confidentiality.

   A businessman who drops his gasoline
prices every Aug. 8 to mark his daughter's anniversary stuck to his
promise this year, even while others jacked up prices after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Leland Morgan said Thursday his goodwill gesture cost him dearly.
   ``We lost a considerable amount, I'm sure,'' he said. ``It ran
into a couple of thousand. In retrospect, I'm not too happy I
guess. But we'll do it again next year.''
   Morgan announced last week that gas prices would drop to 98.8
cents a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline and $1.08.8 for super
unleaded for one day only _ Aug. 8, his daughter Marta's second
wedding anniversary.
   A few days later, Iraq invaded Kuwait, driving up oil and
gasoline prices.
   On Tuesday, Morgan paid his supplier more than $1.20 for regular
unleaded and more than $1.30 for super unleaded.
   Customers began arriving at Marta's Mini Mart in central
Connecticut at 5 a.m. Wednesday, and lines were steady all day
long. Morgan said he sold all but 300 of the 8,000 gallons of gas
in his underground tanks.

   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday
unanimously expressed outrage over Iraq's annexation of Kuwait,
declaring it ``null and void'' and called on all nations to
repudiate the puppet Kuwaiti regime.
   Iraq repudiated the council.
   The vote was 15-0 on the 15-member council, which met for the
third time since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. It demanded
immediate and unconditional Iraqi troop withdrawal from Kuwait. It
has already called for a worldwide economic embargo against Iraq.
   The move was considered one of the strongest Security Council
actions. Combined with the two earlier resolutions of condemnation
and sanctions, it indicated that after years of division and
ineffectiveness, the body was performing its original peacemaking
role.
   Yemen, the council's sole Arab member, voted with the rest of
the council. It abstained in previous votes that condemned the
invasion and ordered global economic sanctions.
   Iraq scorned the resolution, which is considered legally binding
on all U.N. members.
   ``My government reaffirms that the unity between Iraq and Kuwait
is an indestructible one. It is eternal and irreversible,'' Iraqi
Ambassador Ameri al-Anbari said after the vote.
   Al-Anbari blamed the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and
in the region for causing instability and said it had delayed the
promised Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. He said his government has
no intention of invading Saudi Arabia.
   The resolution, introduced by Kuwait and sponsored by
non-aligned nations, says: ``Annexation of Kuwait by Iraq under any
form and whatever pretext has no legal validity, and is considered
null and void.'' It demands Iraq rescind its annexation and urges
all states not to give even indirect recognition to the Kuwaiti
government installed by Iraq.
   ``We cannot allow sovereign state members of the United Nations
to be swallowed up,'' U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the
council.
   Pickering said Iraq repeatedly had lied about its intentions and
demonstrated its ``scorn'' for the international community and
disdain for international law.
   Pickering emphasized that the U.S. presence in the area is
strictly defensive, under provisions of the U.N. Charter, and
intended to help protect Saudi Arabia.
   Pickering and other speakers likened Iraq's behavior to that of
dictators in the 1930s, referring indirectly to Hitler. At that
time, Pickering said, ``The result was global conflagraiton.''
   ``We here will not and cannot let this happen again,'' he said.
   British Ambassador Crispen Tickell said: ``This is an important
day in the history of this (U.N.) institution.'' He said it set a
precedent for the kind of Security Council envisioned when the
United Nations was formed in 1945.
   As the council met, the Soviet Foreign Ministry said Soviet
participation in an international force in the crisis was
contingent upon U.N. auspices.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he respected
the Soviet position, that it deserved consideration, and that the
Security Council would have to decide whether to call for a U.N.
presence in the region.
   The council includes the five permanent members: The United
States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union; and 10 other
members: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast,
Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

   A leukemia patient received her mother's bone
marrow Thursday, after doctors failed to find a perfect match among
50,000 people who volunteered as donors.
   Allison Atlas, 20, had the transplant at Fred Hutchison Cancer
Research Center in Seattle. Her mother, Arline, 54, was the donor.
   The plight of Miss Atlas, a New York University student from
Bethesda, Md., prompted 50,000 people to volunteer for bone marrow
tests. There was no perfect match for Miss Atlas, but 10 other
leukemia patients got donors.
   Mrs. Atlas' marrow matched four of six antigens, or cell
identifiers, from her daughter's marrow.
   Doctors said Miss Atlas would have had a 60 percent chance of
recovery if the donated marrow was a perfect match. Her chances are
reduced ``somewhat'' but other patients with the same degree of
mismatch have recovered, said hospital spokeswoman Alice Burgess
said.
   Without the transplant, she would live less than a year, Burgess
said.
   Leukemia causes white blood cells to multiply uncontrollably.
Bone marrow produces blood, and doctors combat the cancer by
replacing the diseased marrow.
   The Atlas family's public campaign last fall raised $3 million
to process blood samples from the 50,000 people in the United
States and Israel who registered with the National Marrow Donor
Program.

   U.S. Marines fired from a helicopter at
the fortified mansion of President Samuel Doe today, wounding one
of Doe's advisers, a presidential spokesman claimed in a radio
interview.
   The State Department denied that the incident took place.
   The Liberian spokesman described the attack as an attempt to
assassinate Doe.
   He said in a telephone call to the British Broadcasting Corp.
that the unidentified Doe adviser was hit in the chest and neck and
had been hospitalized. The spokesman called on the international
community to pressure the United States to stop any U.S. attempt to
remove Doe.
   ``We categorically deny that happened,'' said a spokesman for
the State Department's Liberian task force.
   Earlier today, relief workers said rebels who oppose
intervention by West African forces in Liberia's civil war
ransacked Nigeria's Embassy, pushing out hundreds of people seeking
refuge there.
   The rebels led by Charles Taylor, advancing toward downtown
Monrovia, today battled government soldiers around the only
hospital still operating, the relief workers said.
   Taylor's rebels launched the embassy attack Wednesday night as
part of their bid to capture the city before the five-nation West
African force arrived, according to Western relief workers who sent
radio messages from Monrovia to Europe.
   Diplomatic sources quoted Taylor as declaring he would capture
the capital by the weekend.
   Taylor's men today fought Doe's troops in Congo Town, an eastern
suburb in which several embassies are located as well as St.
Joseph's Catholic Hospital.
   ``There is fighting going on all around the hospital and workers
there are cut off from an embassy where they were staying,'' said a
relief worker.
   Government soldiers had managed until now to hold Taylor's
forces back in Paynesville, on the outskirts of Monrovia. But they
reportedly met little resistance in their overnight advance.
   The five-nation West African force, dominated by Nigerian
soldiers, mobilized to move into the war-ravaged nation and impose
a cease-fire, using force if necessary.
   Troops and tanks were reported to be massing across Liberia's
northern border in Guinea and to the east on the Sierra Leone
border, according to military sources in Ghana and Sierra Leone.
   The rebel movements raise tensions in the region two days after
leaders of the West African Economic Community decided to send
troops to impose a cease-fire in the 7-month-old civil war.
   Rebels fighting for Taylor's National Patriotic Front on
Wednesday forced hundreds of Nigerians taking refuge in the embassy
compound into the streets of Monrovia, said a spokeswoman for a
Western relief group.
   ``They plundered the embassy and forced the refugees out,'' said
the spokeswoman for the group. It was not clear whether anyone was
injured.
   The name of the agency was withheld to protect the safety of its
workers.
   There was no immediate comment from Nigeria's ruling military
council. It was meeting today in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, to
give the force of law to President Ibrahim Babangida's decision to
send troops to Liberia.
   On Wednesday, the rival rebel forces of Taylor and Prince
Johnson waged bruising street battles in Monrovia with each other
and with forces loyal to Doe, who remains holed up in his mansion
in Monrovia.
   Johnson on Wednesday freed the last of dozens of foreign
hostages, including one American, he had seized earlier in the
week. Johnson's threat on Saturday to begin rounding up Americans
and other foreigners prompted hundreds of U.S. Marines to enter
Liberia from Navy ships offshore to rescue Americans.
   Taylor had threatened to attack any international force that
might intervene, saying it would be trying to prop up Doe's
government. But this week his envoys told an African summit in
Gambia that he might accept the force.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday
that 2,000 West African troops were being sent to Monrovia by sea
from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
   Nations sending soldiers are Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra
Leone and Togo.
   The seven-month war began when Taylor led an insurgent force
across he border from the Ivory Coast, accusing Doe of corruption
and mismanagement. The war has since turned into a largely tribal
conflict, with both sides accused of killing hundreds of civilians
from opposing tribes.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the foreigners freed by Johnson on Wednesday were back at a hotel.
He said they include one American, whom he identified only as Chris
Mendez.
   A contingent of Marines was at the walled U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia, ready to defend it if necessary. About 2,100 remained
stationed in ships off Liberia. They were sent to evacuate
Americans.

   Red Cross relief worker Emanuel
Christen, appearing thin but healthy, had an emotional homecoming
Thursday after 10 months in captivity in Lebanon.
   But joy at his release was tempered by concern for fellow Swiss
hostage Elio Erriquez, who was abducted Oct. 6 along with Christen.
   Christen was the first Western hostage released since two
Americans were freed in April.
   Christen, 33, bounded down the steps of a Red Cross-chartered
aircraft that arrived at Zurich's Kloten airport after a four-hour
flight from the Syrian capital, Damascus. His parents and four
brothers and sisters rushed onto the tarmac to embrace him.
   Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber and Cornelio Sommaruga,
president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, also
greeted Christen, who was turned over late Wednesday to Syrian
officials.
   Dressed in white shirt and beige trousers, Christen was clean
shaven and showed few signs of his ordeal. He smiled at dozens of
waiting reporters and photographers but declined to answer
questions.
   A hitherto unknown group, calling itself the Palestinian
Revolutionary Squads, announced on Tuesday night that both of the
Swiss Red Cross workers would be freed within 24 hours.
   There was no explanation from the kidnappers for the delay in
freeing Erriquez.
   Before being abducted, both men worked as orthopedic technicians
at a Red Cross hospital in the southern Lebanese port of Sidon.
   The Swiss foreign minister told Swiss TV he was confident
Christen's release was a ``signal for the next liberation.''
   ``We are happy that Emanuel is free but we are also concerned
that Elio is still a captive,'' Christen's mother, Marianne
Christen, said in a separate television interview.
   She said she was shocked earlier when she saw a photo of her son
released by the kidnappers shortly before he was freed. She said he
seemed thin and ``has such a sad look.''
   A Swiss Embassy staff member in Damascus, Claudine Zbinden, said
Christen had lost about 30 pounds. ``But he is in relative good
shape, if one may say so,'' Ms. Zbinden said Thursday in a
telephone interview.
   Both the Swiss Foreign Ministry and the Geneva-headquartered
International Committee of the Red Cross denied any deal was made
with the kidnappers to win the hostage's release.
   In their statement Tuesday, the Palestine Revolutionary Squads
said they decided to free the two Swiss captives ``after we
acquired guarantees that our demands will be met.''
   Erriquez's brother Antoine said he was convinced there had been
a deal between the kidnappers and Swiss officials.
   ``They had to make a concession even if they deny it, '' he
said. ``But it is also possible that the terrorists, after
releasing one hostage, are now waiting whether all of their demands
are being met before also freeing my brother.''
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the release may have
been a result of France's decision last month to pardon Anis
Naccache and four other members of a pro-Iranian assassination team.
   A ministry spokesman said France was informed immediately after
Naccache's release July 27 that Iran would pursue efforts to free
hostages held in Lebanon and that two Europeans would be freed soon.
   Christen's release brought to 15 the number of foreigners held
hostage in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   After six weeks of testimony, the jury in the
Central Park jogger case began deliberations Thursday, weighing the
charges against three teen-agers in one of the city's most infamous
crimes.
   Yusef Salaam, 16, Raymond Santana, 15, and Antron McCray, 16,
are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, riot,
assault and robbery in attacks on the woman and on two male joggers
during a rampage on April 19, 1989.
   The woman was dragged into the woods, gang-raped, bashed with a
brick and a pipe and left to die in a pool of blood after going
into the park for her nightly run. The brutality of the attack and
her surprising recovery caught the attention of the city and the
nation.
   Defense lawyers summed up Tuesday, with one attorney suggesting
the victim was not gang-raped and another accusing detectives of
lying about how incriminating statements were obtained from the
three defendants.
   The three were tried as adults, but if convicted would be
sentenced as juveniles, limiting the length of any prison terms.
   Videotaped statements by McCray and Santana were shown during
the trial and again during the closing argument Wednesday.
   The jury Thursday requested the written statements the three
defendants gave police. The defense has charged the statements were
coerced from the defendants.
   The panel also asked the judge about the admissibility of any
statement made by a minor without a parent or guardian present.
   ``The fact that a parent was not present during the questioning
of a juvenile does not automatically mean the statement is
involuntary,'' Justice Thomas Galligan told the jurors.
   The 30-year-old jogger is back at work as a vice president at
Salomon Brothers investment bankers. In a dramatic appearance at
the trial, she testified that she still suffers from impaired
sight, balance and smell as a result of the attack.
   ``The fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a
miracle,'' prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl dropped plans
Thursday to advance all-German elections by six weeks, a major
political defeat for the leader who until now had set the pace of
German unification.
   Still uncertain, however, was whether formal unity would proceed
on Oct. 14 apart from parliamentary elections, now set for Dec. 2.
Kohl and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere had wanted
to hold elections and declare unity the same day.
   Kohl's decision followed a day-long parliamentary debate in
which the opposition Social Democrats insisted they would not give
him the two-thirds majority necessary for a constitutional change
needed to move up elections.
   In addition, the East German parliament failed Thursday to
approve new electoral rules for an Oct. 14 election.
   Also Thursday, Kohl said the cost of bailing out beleaguered
East Germany is exceeding expectations.
   Up until Thursday, Kohl had been able to set the pace of unity
more or less according to his own plans to ensure continued control
for his conservative coalition in the new Germany.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble announced Kohl's change in
position during a meeting of the ``German Unity'' committee of
government ministers, according to participants who spoke later on
condition of anonymity.
   The West German Social Democrats welcomed abandonment of what
they termed Kohl's and de Maiziere's ``nonsensical'' plan for
elections and unity Oct. 14.
   A spokesman for the East German Social Democrats said the party
was ``pleased to see Dec. 2 confirmed as the date for all-German
elections.''
   ``It is not an earlier election date but quick unity that
creates the necessary framework ... for secure investments,'' said
Social Democrats spokesman Juergen Itzfeldt.
   The Social Democrats demand unity first, then elections Dec. 2.
   West Germany has previously said that unity should not occur
before the Sept. 12 meeting in Moscow of the four World War II
allies and the two Germanys to wrap up the ``two-plus-four'' talks
on international aspects of German unity.
   The two Germanys are finishing work on a unification treaty that
paves the way for the legal merger of the two countries. It is
expected to be finished by late August or early September.
   Kohl had also hoped to have a treaty regulating all-German
elections ratified by both Parliaments by Thursday evening.
   But the measure just barely failed to get the needed two-thirds
majority in the East German parliament, and West German lawmakers
decided to postpone their own vote until Aug. 23. East German
lawmakers are to consider the measure again Aug. 22.
   The treaty in all likelihood will be passed on those dates. But
the delays put a time squeeze on the West German chancellor's hopes
of making the constitutional change necessary for Oct. 14 elections.
   The Social Democrats had charged that Kohl wanted to speed up
elections out of fear voters will turn against him as East
Germany's economy further unravels. But Kohl maintained that
earlier elections would be best for helping ensure economic and
social stability in East Germany.

<HEAD>USDA Forecasts Slightly Larger Corn Harvest This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are looking at a potential 1990 corn
harvest of 7.85 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   At 7.85 billion bushels, this fall's harvest would be the
largest since 8.25 billion bushels in 1986. The record was the 1985
crop of nearly 8.9 billion bushels.
   ``Dry conditions in the southeastern states have reduced yields
in most areas from the record levels of 1989,'' said the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board.
   But the report added that ``late plantings in the Corn Belt have
been offset by excellent growing conditions in July.''
   Farmers harvested 7.53 billion bushels in 1989, and the
department a month ago projected this year's output might be 7.85
billion bushels, based on yield trends and normal weather.
   Thursday's figures were the first of the season by USDA based on
yield estimates and surveys, reflecting conditions as of Aug. 1.
   Corn yields were estimated at 117.7 bushels per acre harvested,
compared with 116.2 last year. The record was 119.4 bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is an essential ingredient for the production of
meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb 6 percent or more in 1990.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.84 billion bushels, down 5 percent from
last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.9 million bales, up 22
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales.
   Total wheat output was estimated at 2.71 billion bushels, up 33
percent from the 1989 harvest and fractionally more than indicated
in July.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 111
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. That is the
highest reading since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985.
   Last year, although crop production rebounded sharply from the
1988 drought, total output averaged only 106 percent. The record
was 117 percent in 1981 and 1982.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1990-91 marketing year, which
begins Sept. 1, is expected to be about 7.975 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand exceeding 1990 corn production, that will mean a
further drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.2 billion bushels
left over by Sept. 1, 1991, down from inventories estimated at 1.33
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year this Sept. 1.
   But that represents only a slight dip in the U.S. corn
stockpile, compared to last season's decline, when it plummeted
from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988 to 1.93 billion bushels
on hand last Sept. 1.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of
$2.35 to $2.75 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, compared
with $2.38 forecast for the current season.
   Soybean prices at the farm were forecast at $5.50 to $7 per
bushel in 1990-91, compared with $5.70 in the last marketing year.
   The report said farm prices of wheat may average $2.65 to $3.05
per bushel, compared with $3.72 the last two marketing years.
   Other 1990 crop estimates, based on Aug. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 546.8 million bushels and an average yield of 59.1
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   _Rice, 158.1 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,611 pounds
per acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   _Peanuts, 4.18 billion pounds and a yield of 2,449 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   _Tobacco, 1.52 billion pounds and a yield of 2,102 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   _Sugar beets, 28.1 million tons and a yield of 20.4 tons per
acre, compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   _Sugar cane, 24.9 million tons and a yield of 35.1 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

   Iraq announced Thursday its borders were closed to foreigners _
apparently meaning both arriving and departing. Arab evacuees
reaching Jordan said Thursday a group of Westerners trying to leave
Iraq had been stopped just before the Jordanian border.
   About 400 Americans are believed stranded in Iraq, and 3,000 in
Kuwait. Their plight raised fears the Iraqis might seize them as
hostages.
   The Americans in Baghdad include 38 who were transported from
Kuwait to the Iraqi capital after the invasion. In Washington, the
White House said the 38 still were not being allowed to leave their
hotel, which was ringed by armed guards. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
also said, ``We have been told that diplomats, only, will be
allowed to leave.''
   Meanwhile, some misgivings began to emerge in Washington about
the U.S. role on the front line of the Arab crisis, particularly in
the absence of broad Arab backing.
   ``If it appears that it's the United States and Saudi Arabia
versus the rest of the Arab world, then that is not going to be in
our long-term interest or Saudi Arabia's interest,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., Armed Services Committee chairman. He expressed
support for the deployment but said a large long-term U.S. presence
is ``not desirable.''

<HEAD>EPA To Require Reduced Diesel Fuel Sulfur Levels</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it will require an 80 percent reduction of sulfur in
diesel fuel starting Oct. 1, 1993.
   The new requirement is expected to add from 1.8 to 2.3 cents per
gallon to the cost of the fuel, the agency said.
   Diesel exhaust has been identified as a potential cause of
cancer. EPA administrator William K. Reilly said the sulfur
reduction requirement and new standards to reduce particulates
beginning in 1991 ``will virtually eliminate the black smoke from
diesel tailpipes, cutting particulates by 90 percent.''
   The most impact will be felt in urban areas, where pollution is
heaviest and the most people are exposed, Reilly said in a
statement.
   However, the private Environmental Defense Fund said the EPA
plan doesn't go far enough because it does not reduce aromatics _
chemicals the defense fund says are responsible for almost half the
particulate emissions in some cities.
   The EPA said it will control aromatics ``at about current
levels'' by requiring a performance rating for diesel fuel or an
optional maximum aromatics content standard.
   That plan ``doesn't take advantage of a major strategy to help
clean up polluted cities that's relatively cost effective and
cleans up emissions from every vehicle on the road that burns
diesel,'' said Bob Yuhnke, a senior attorney with the defense fund.
   He said EPA's steps will result in a 15 to 20 percent reduction
in particulate emissions from diesel fuel compared to a 35 to 40
percent reduction in California, which has reduced both sulfur and
aromatics.
   The new EPA sulfur rule is based on a 1988 proposal developed
jointly by the diesel-engine manufacturing and petroleum refining
industries.
   It requires refiners to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuel
used on the road from .25 percent by weight to .05 percent.
   Cost to refiners is expected to range from $380 million to $910
million in 1995 and $540 million to $1.3 billion by 2010.
   Those costs will be at least partially offset for the consumer
by cheaper emission control devices, fuel savings from catalytic
devices and possibly less wear on the engine, EPA said.
   Small refiners have until 1995 to phase in the new standards as
they install equipment needed to remove the sulfur. They will have
to meet interim standards during that period.
   From 1993 to 1995, fuel produced under the interim standards
will be sold only for pre-1994 engine equipped vehicles or to
off-highway markets, the EPA said. That is in order to protect 1994
and later model-year engine designs that will require only
low-sulfur fuel.
   The sulfur reductions are expected to help diesel engine
manufacturers meet tighter particulate exhaust standards that will
take effect in 1991 and 1994. The EPA said the lower level of
sulfur will reduce direct emissions of sulfate particulates and
also reduce secondary formation of particulates in the atmosphere.
   By 1995, particulates are projected to be down by 196,000 tons a
year. Sulfur dioxide levels should decrease by 580,000 tons per
year, the agency said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III received
pledges Wednesday from Turkey that its air bases could be used as
staging areas for U.S. military strikes against Iraq in the event
of war.
   Baker then flew to NATO headquarters in Brussels seeking a
reaffirmation the allies would rush to Turkey's defense if Iraq
attacked its neighbor.
   Baker's meetings in Ankara with President Turgut Ozal and other
Turkish officials will expand military and intelligence cooperation
with the front-line state, which fears Iraqi intimidation for
effectively shutting down two oil pipelines and freezing trade with
Baghdad.
   U.S. and Western diplomats said the Turks took those steps
reluctantly, and that some 60,000 Turkish workers in Iraq could be
vulnerable as the U.S.-organized economic boycott tightens.
   Turkey, which stands to lose an estimated $3 billion a year in
commerce with Iraq, received through Baker an offer of some
compensation from the oil-rich Kuwaiti royal family that was
overthrown in the Iraqi invasion.
   For his part, Baker promised the United States would back Turkey
in its request for development loans from the World Bank and would
provide credits for Turkey to import industrial machinery.
   Also, an administration official said, Baker wrote a letter to
the European Community supporting Turkey's application for
membership in the 12-nation European Community.
   As Baker left Ankara after a nine-hour visit, he was reluctant
to discuss his request for permission to use an air base near the
southern city of Adana or smaller posts as a staging area in the
event of a U.S. attack on Iraq.
   The United States has a military force of 2,400 at the
Turkish-operated training facility and rotates up to two dozen
F-111 bombers there, similar to the planes used in a 1986 raid
against Libya.
   Turkey is also strategically located for gathering intelligence
on the Soviet Union, Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries.
   ``The use for which we can utilize those bases is well
understood,'' Baker said. ``I'm not going to speculate about
possible hypotheticals.''
   Later, on the flight to Brussels, an administration official
briefing reporters on Baker's meetings said that ``in the event
there were to be full-scale hostilities, I am quite confident that
we could count upon our allies, the Turks.''
   The official, who demanded anonymity, added: `We've long had
cooperative military relationships with Turkey. I think the Turks
see the threat that (President) Saddam Hussein represents. And I
think they see the threat his long-range missile capability and his
chemical weapons capability presents to many, many nations.''
   Describing Turkey as ``exposed'' to a potential Iraqi attack,
the official said ``I think they know that the allies are going to
be there and that the United States is going to be there _ and they
are going to be there for the United States.''
   On the other hand, Baker said Turkey had not committed itself to
join the multinational force the United States is organizing to
enforce the economic sanctions approved by the U.N. Security
Council.
   ``Turkey has not, and that's a question that the Turkish
government will have to consider,'' Baker said.
   The strategy of the Bush administration is to encircle Iraq with
a diverse group of nations, including Turkey, a staunch U.S. ally
in NATO, and two bitter adversaries, Syria and Iran.
   Baker was cheered by the unanimous U.N. Security Council vote
condemning Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.
   ``Our strategy from the very beginning is to try to bring about
as much of an international consensus in condemnation of this
action and support of an immediate withdrawal as we could,'' an
administration official said.
   Asked if he would like Saddam Hussein to look at a map and see
all those countries lining up against him, the official broke into
a grin.
   ``Yeah, you bet,'' he said.
   In Brussels on Friday, Baker will meet with the 15 NATO foreign
ministers to try to organize a military blockade to back up the
U.N.'s economic boycott.
   The crisis over Iraq apparently will benefit Saudi Arabia in at
least one way.
   The official said the Bush administration would revive a plan to
sell 20 F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, hoping the threat Iraq
poses to Saudi oil fields would convince Congressional critics not
to try to block the deal.

   The eerie silence is often broken by the
sound of gunshots in the deserted streets of Kuwait City, where
soldiers of the Iraqi invasion army squat and sleep on the
sidewalks, travelers reported Thursday.
   After reaching Manama, the travelers told of beatings,
humiliations and looting they said were committed by Iraqi soldiers.
   They said the Iraqis often knock on doors and ask frightened
Kuwaitis for cold water. Sometimes they ask for food, mainly beef
and fruit.
   Kuwaiti refugee Youssef al-Rashidi, 26, told The Associated
Press in an interview at the plush Diplomat Hotel that in the
sweltering summer heat, ``profusely sweating Iraqis soldiers look
tired and, I would say, ashamed of themselves.''
   ``A number of Iraqi soldiers came to us and tried to calm us
down, saying ``we will do you no harm ... we have nothing against
you ... we only carry out orders,''' he said.
   ``But my companions here have different things to tell you
about. Not all Iraqi soldiers are good. Some of them are sons of
disgrace.''
   He pointed to four other young Kuwaiti men, who quickly nodded
approval. One claimed that Iraqi soldiers were ``not begging for,
but forcing local residents to give them bottles of cold water and
fruit.''
   ``I saw Iraqi soldiers heap in trucks sacks of money and bits of
furniture stolen from the Gulf Bank,'' said another. ``My brother,
Essa, saw Iraqi soldiers loot the al-Ghanem and al-Babtain car
showrooms.''
   Another Kuwait refugee, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, claimed he saw from a distance jewelry shops being
looted.
   ``I saw Iraqi soldiers armed with rifles stop uniformed Kuwaiti
soldiers, force them to remove the uniforms and then order them to
return home in their underwear,'' he said.
   Kuwaiti businessman Mohsen al-Ajmi, 28, said he took part in
garbage removal and maintenance operations to help housewives whose
husbands were stranded outside Kuwait when the Iraqis struck.
   ``We supplied these families with food and gas cylinders (for
cooking),'' he said. ``We also took part in minor resistance
operations, knocked down two Iraqi soldiers with our speeding car,
and distributed anti-Saddam leaflets.''
   He was referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``There are committees at district and suburb levels to help out
Kuwaiti families in many ways. I saw a number of Palestinians take
part in street patrols alongside the Iraqis. These must be
Palestinians loyal to Arafat. But there are other Palestinians who
curse Saddam and Arafat and fight alongside Kuwaiti resistance.''
   Many Kuwaitis accuse PLO chairman Yasser Arafat of backing the
invasion and denounce him.
   Al-Ajmi said Iraqi soldiers at an intersection stopped him and
others two days ago for questioning.
   ``They did not search us. In fact, they apologized and cursed
Saddam. One said `Why are we here? We have been hurting Kuwaitis
and drinking warm water in this heat, when Saddam sits there in his
air-conditioned palace,''' he said.
   Al-Ajmi said the Iraqis spotted two Egyptian workers passing
nearby, called them, asked them to show identity cards and then
said: ``Egyptians? You don't deserve to live.''
   ``They beat the two Egyptians so savagely that we implored them
to stop. They let the Egyptians go. They were hurt quite badly .''
   Most expatriate workers have left Kuwait, a shipping company
executive said.
   He said he communicated with contacts in Kuwait by radio earlier
Thursday. ``I was told that probably more than 70 percent of the
kuwaitis have left the country,'' he said.
   Even before the invasion, Kuwaitis were a minority in their own
country _ making up about 27 percent of the total population of 1.9
million. The rest are expatriate workers, mostly Palestinians,
Egyptians, Iranians, Indians and Pakistanis.
   Al-Ajmi said resistance was ``getting weaker.''
   ``Resistance is not really organized,'' he said. ``A number of
Kuwaiti soldiers and civilians have banded together in resistance
nests and occasionally harass the Iraqis.
   ``But their stocks of weapons and ammunition, not to mention
food and other necessities, are steadily getting scarce. Resistance
can grow, but not before we ensure adequate and secure supply
routes to them from wherever Allah deems fit,''
   Travelers said Iraqi soldiers scared away a group of ``stubborn
Kuwaiti women'' who demonstrated in the Suleibikhat area. The women
were shouting ``Long live Jaber! Kuwait will never die! Down with
Saddam!''
   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah is the deposed emir.
   ``The Iraqis thretened to shoot and scattered the women when
they attacked and hit with rifle butts,'' said one Kuwait woman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Other Kuwaitis said they saw from behind window shutters Iraqi
women shouting ``Down with Jaber! Long live Saddam, hero of Arab
unity!''
   ``I saw that demonstration,'' said 16-year-old Rasha al-Faraj.
``The women's accent was unmistakably Iraqi. They were guarded and
protected by Iraqi soldiers.''

   Barbara Bush returned to the White House
Thursday after 12 days apart from President Bush in Maine.
   She brought the family's English springer spaniel, Millie, with
her. The dog has been recovering from acute lead exposure after
ingesting paint remover used in White House restoration work.
   The first lady planned to head back to the family's oceanfront
retreat in Kennebunkport Friday with President Bush, who is
planning a 3{-week stay in Maine.
   The White House said Thursday that Bush still intends to go on
vacation, despite the ongoing crisis in Kuwait and his decision to
send American troops, ships and warplanes to defend Saudi Arabia.
   Both Bushes spent the last weekend of July in Kennebunkport.
When the president returned to the White House July 29, Mrs. Bush
stayed behind with several grandchildren and other family.
   Sondra Haley, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said Mrs. Bush
had no public events planned. ``It's a private day,'' she said.

   Even if other oil-producing nations start
pumping to capacity, the world will still have a million barrels a
day less oil than before Iraq invaded Kuwait, analysts said
Thursday.
   Prices this fall could double or even triple the June level,
they said.
   The embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait last week has removed 4.5 million barrels of oil
from the market _ more than 9 percent of production in the
non-communist world.
   If Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates together increase
their production to full capacity _ a big if, analysts say _
together they could replace only 2.5 million barrels daily.
   The Energy Department said Thursday that Iran also is
considering increasing production by as much as 500,000 barrels a
day, hoping to replace Iraq as a key supplier to India and Japan.
   Outside the Middle East _ Venezuela, Nigeria, the United States
and possibly Great Britain together could add another 1 million to
1.5 million barrels to daily world production over time, but that
would still leave at least a 1 million barrel shortage.
   ``If this offsetting surge capacity were brought on line, it
could reduce the temporary loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to a net
loss of only 1.45 million barrels per day,'' the Energy Department
said in a statement.
   Prices of West Texas Intermediate crude soared from an average
$17.70 last week to more than $28 on Tuesday before settling around
$25.85 Thursday after President Bush dispatched 5,000 troops to
help protect Saudi oil fields.
   But analysts predict prices will rise to the $30-$35 range in
September and October if consuming countries don't fill the gap by
tapping their emergency government stockpiles. Some maintain prices
could rise above that range until the increased production is
flowing.
   ``Prices will undoubtedly go higher, possibly reaching $40 to
$50 per barrel in the absence of action by consuming nations,''
said Philip Verleger, an oil analyst for the Institute of
International Economics.
   The situation will only get worse if the embargo continues into
the winter, when cold weather will push the worldwide demand up
another 3 million barrels, experts say.
   ``The fourth quarter is going to be a problem no matter how you
slice it,'' said Adam Sieminski, an oil economist for Washington
Analysis Corp.
   ``Everybody seems to be hoping that this production will be
coming on real fast, but what if there's a hitch ... and a cold
winter?'' he said. ``The system already is going to be stretched
everywhere.''
   Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency, meeting in Paris,
took the first step Thursday to what could result in a draw down of
government stockpiles in Europe, the United States and Japan to
help fill temporary shortages.
   Although the agency traditionally has looked upon a 7 percent
drop in supplies as the ``trigger point'' for scheduling a
coordinated draw down, the government energy officials stopped
short of ordering one Thursday doing it in response to the 9
percent supply loss represented by Kuwait and Iraq.
   Instead, they agreed to begin collecting daily statistics on
stocks, usage, supplies and prices in what was described as
``gearing up to be capable to do something.''
   The United States has 587 million barrels of crude stored in its
Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Texas and Louisiana, enough to
replace the 750,000 barrels of the country had been getting daily
from Iraq and Kuwait for 800 days. Iraq and Kuwait had supplied by
5 percent of the U.S. daily oil consumption of 17.6 million barrels.
   Japan, which had relied on Iraq and Kuwait for 14 percent of its
oil imports, has 206 million barrels and Germany 189 million
barrels in reserve.
   The Bush administration contends that because of recent cuts in
production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, enough producing capacity is available without tapping
the emergency reserves as a price control mechanism.
   Cheating by member nations on quotas imposed by OPEC had
contributed to oil prices dropping from $23 a barrel last January
to $15.50 in mid-June.
   In response to an OPEC meeting then when exporting countries
agreed to quit cheating on the quotas totaling 22.5 million barrels
a day, prices had risen back to $20 by the end of July.

   A highly decorated Vietnam fighter pilot has
been put in charge of America's effort to bolster Saudi Arabia's
defenses.
   Air Force Lt.Gen. Charles A. Horner, a native of Davenport,
Iowa, is in the region to oversee ``Desert Shield'' _ the U.S.
effort to deter any Iraqi move against the oil-rich kingdom, the
Pentagon announced on Thursday.
   ``He's the forward commander. He's the one that's on the ground
and out in the boonies directing the show,'' said one Pentagon
officer.
   The 53-year-old three-star general is known as a hard-driving
worker, a command pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours who
regularly takes to the skies in a variety of modern fighter jets.
   Ironically, when the general appeared before the Rotary Club in
his native Davenport in 1987, he told its members that the United
States' interest in the Persian Gulf area was protection of oil
sources and shipping.
   At the time, the U.S. Navy was helping escort Kuwaiti tankers
during the Iran-Iraq hostilities.
   According to an account of the speech in the Quad City Times
newspaper, Horner told his listeners that American forces were in
the area to protect freedom of navigation, ``not to take sides in
Arabian wars.''
   Horner is the commander of the 9th Air Force and the U.S.
Central Command Air Forces at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.
   The Central Command is responsible for the Middle East theater,
which stretches from Pakistan to Kenya and has at its heart the
region that contains 70 percent of the world's oil reserves.
   During tours of duty in Thailand during the Vietnam War, Horner
tallied more than 100 combat missions in F-105 fighter bombers. He
served as an F-105 instructor at the Fighter Weapons School in
Nellis AFB in Nevada and went on to hold a number of positions in
the Tactical Air Command, at Langley, AFB in Virginia.
   A graduate of the Armed Forces Staff College and the National
War College, he commanded the 405th Tactical Training Wing at Luke
AFB in Arizona, the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing at Nellis and the
833rd Air Division at Holloman AFB in New Mexico.
   In May, 1985, he was assigned the deputy chief for plans at the
Tactical Air Command Headquarters and assumed his present command
in 1987.
   Horner's military decorations include the Distinguished Service
Medal, the Silver Star with one oak leaf cluster, the Legion of
Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Meritorious Service Medal, Air
Medal and Air Force Commendation Medal.
   An Iowa native and a graduate of the University of Iowa with a
general science degree, Horner is remembered as being a serious
student and a good companion.
   ``So Charlie is running the show in Saudi Arabia?'' said Phil
Lainson, a physician who was Horner's fraternity brother in
college. ``I remember him as a man who enjoyed himself but was a
hard worker.''
   Judy Hendershot, director of placement services at the
University of Iowa education department, recalled her childhood
friend as ``very pleasant, fun.''
   She said his life was touched by tragedy when his parents, his
sister, brother-in-law and their two children perished in a car
accident in the 1960s.
   Nona Wilson Warden, who attended high school with Horner, said
she received a four-page letter from him about a month ago because
he had been unable to attend a school reunion.
   ``He sounded just like he did when we were in high school,'' she
said. ``He was just a fun-loving kid. ... He had a great
personality. Everybody liked him and he liked everybody.''
   ``What he has accomplished is amazing. But from his letter, you
can just see that he has taken everything in stride,'' Ms. Warden
said.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Debt Limit Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a measure Thursday
raising the federal debt limit to almost $3.2 trillion through Oct.
2.
   The move will keep the government from running out of money in
mid-August, raising the permissible amount of federal indebtedness
by $72.3 billion to $3,195,000,000,000.
   The House last week voted to raise the limit by $322 billion to
give the Treasury more breathing room.
   But that bill was faced extended debate and possible amendments
on unrelated subjects, so the lawmakers passed the smaller to keep
then government running before the leaving last weekend for a
one-month vacation.
   The government is expected to hit its old debt ceiling of
$3,122,700,000,000 on Aug. 15. As of the close of business
Wednesday, total federal debt was $3,117,914,000,000 _ to the
nearest million.
   The federal government has never defaulted on its loans. In
debate last week, lawmakers warned that even a brief default could
send interest rates soaring and stagger confidence in the economy.

   The government sent more
police, soldiers and helicopters Thursday to a southeastern port
city where rioting in mixed-race suburbs has killed more than 30
people.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said many more people had
been injured in Port Elizabeth, but he gave no figures. Police said
33 people had died since Monday and more than 100 had been arrested.
   Police and political organizations in the city say that most of
the violence was caused by roving mobs of people looting and
burning. Criminals are also contributing to the chaos.
   Another six blacks died elsewhere in the country Wednesday and
Thursday, including four in black factional fighting at the
President Steyn gold mine in Orange Free State province.
   The riots in the northern Port Elizabeth suburbs of Bloemendal,
Arcadia, Chatty, Windvogel and Hillside began Monday in a clash
between members of a political group and police.
   But neither the local Northern Areas Action Committee nor the
affiliated African National Congress has any control over the
hundreds of rioters who have stormed through the streets, throwing
rocks and gasoline bombs.
   ``Criminal mobs ran amok ... looting and burning shops at random
and causing damage ... A baby was shot dead in its mother's lap,''
said local journalist Cliff Foster.
   Police repeatedly fired shotguns and pistols to disperse the
mobs. Businessmen have also been reported firing at looters before
fleeing with their families.
   Government television showed crowds of people walking out of
stores with stolen goods as riot control officers made vain
attempts to chase and nab one or two looters.
   Police removed liquor from many shops Thursday to cut down on
the mob behavior.
   Telephone, trash collection, mail and all other public services
were cut off to the riot areas. Municipal employees had been
targeted for attack and, along with almost all other residents,
stayed home from work to protect their houses.
   The car manufacturing plants that employ many of Port
Elizabeth-area blacks were nearly at a standstill. Burning
barricades in the streets blocked ambulances and fire trucks from
getting in.
   Shops, factories, schools, a church, police and private vehicles
were burned, said Port Elizabeth police spokesman Maj. Bill Dennis.
   In other unrest, police said Thursday three people were killed
and 18 injured Wednesday night when workers attacked other staff at
President Steyn gold mine at Welkom. Police arrested 35 men. On
Thursday, the mine owner, Anglo-American Corp., announced that a
fourth miner had been found dead underground, but gave no further
information.
   The National Union of Mineworkers denied the police version of
the conflict. The union said police fired on miners protesting
discrimination at the mine.
   Police reported Thursday two men had been killed in black
faction fighting in Natal Province, including one man ``necklaced''
with a burning car tire.
   New factional fighting between supporters of the African
National Congress and Inkatha, a conservative Zulu group, broke out
again Thursday in Kagiso, a black township outside Johannesburg,
police said. No new deaths were immediately reported in the
fighting, which has claimed 15 lives since Sunday.

   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched in 12 years, reaches Venus on Friday, raising
NASA's hopes for a major success after its woes with the Hubble
space telescope and the shuttle fleet.
   ``We're just thrilled to be here and are rarin' to go. We're
just as excited as we can be,'' said John McCarthy, Magellan
program manager for Hughes Aircraft Co. Hughes built the science
instruments on the 21-foot-long spacecraft.
   At noon PDT Thursday, Magellan was only 242,009 miles from
Venus, speeding toward the cloud-shrouded planet at 10,398 mph. It
was 144 million miles from Earth, but had traveled 946.3 million
miles since it was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
   The $413 million spacecraft, centerpiece of a $744 million
mission, was scheduled to zoom over Venus' north pole and then drop
into orbit after it fires its braking rocket at 9:32 a.m. PDT
Friday. The spacecraft will be behind Venus at the time, so
engineers won't know if all went well until about half an hour
later.
   After a few weeks of tests, Magellan will start using its radar
by Sept. 1 to penetrate the thick Venusian clouds and make pictures
and maps of the planet's surface 10 times more detailed than those
returned by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which were
launched in 1983.
   During a news conference Thursday at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, engineers and
scientists expressed confidence that Magellan's rocket will fire
properly and place the vessel in orbit.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' kicking off a decade in which unmanned craft will
study Jupiter, Mars, asteroids, comets and Saturn, said Wesley T.
Huntress Jr., NASA's director of solar system exploration. ``We're
looking forward to the drama.''
   Magellan is the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since
1978, when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13
probes to Venus.
   If Magellan's rocket fails to ignite, the spacecraft would fly
past Venus uselessly and wouldn't encounter the planet again for
100 years, said Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the
laboratory.
   NASA has been plagued by trouble lately, including temporary
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen fuel leaks and a
defective mirror that largely crippled the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Huntress said. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   If Magellan works as planned, it will return more data than all
previous NASA missions combined, said Steve Saunders, NASA's chief
scientist for Magellan.
   Venus is similar to Earth is size, density and position in the
solar system. Magellan will study's the planet's geology and
geography to learn if its geological processes are similar to those
on Earth, which is shaped by volcanoes and large-scale movements of
gargantuan plates of the planet's crust.
   ``Venus really is our sister planet,'' Saunders said. ``We need
to know a lot more about that planet to understand more about our
own.''
   The raw radar echoes collected by Magellan will be returned to
NASA Deep Space Network antennas in California, Spain and
Australia, then converted into pictures at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   NASA expects to release the first pictures next month, unless a
major discovery is made during radar tests this month.
   Magellan is named for Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan,
who circumnavigated the world in the early 1500s.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying ``life goes on,''
Thursday decided to head for Maine on a 3{-week vacation despite
the crisis in the Middle East.
   ``Gotta keep moving. Can't stay in one place all the time,'' a
jocular Bush told reporters after leaving the Oval Office early in
the evening.
   The White House announced earlier that Bush would leave for his
summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, as planned Friday, but will
take extra staff with him because of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   Bush, who was on his way out to dinner with wife Barbara, told
reporters, ``Life goes on.''
   Barbara Bush has been staying at the summer home by herself
since July 27. She flew to Washington for the day Thursday and will
return to Kennebunkport with the president Friday.
   ``The president will be conducting the business of the
presidency at Kennebunkport just as he does every year and every
vacation,'' press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   That goes on ``24 hours a day, every day of the week, wherever
he is,'' the spokesman added.
   But Bush is also expected to make a quick trip back to the
capital on Wednesday for a comprehensive briefing from military
planners on the status of the U.S. forces sent to Saudi Arabia.
   Bush's oceanfront home at Walker's Point has its own helipad,
sophisticated communications equipment, and is heavily protected on
land by the Secret Service and at sea by Coast Guard ships hovering
offshore.
   The president has hosted world leaders during past vacations.
Top advisers shuttled back and forth from Washington last August as
Bush readied his national drug strategy.
   While the president has not announced a VIP guest list for this
vacation, Fitzwater said Bush will have full access to one of his
favorite instruments of diplomacy, the telephone.
   ``We believe that the communications system is excellent for
maintaining liaison with anyone in Washington or around the world
that the president should need to get in touch with,'' the
spokesman said.
   He said the White House never seriously considered cancelling
the vacation plans.
   Asked if the president was not concerned about being
photographed out boating or on the golf course while American GIs
in Saudi Arabia are worried about a possible chemical weapons
attack by Iraq, Fitzwater answered, ``No.''
   Bush has gone to Kennebunkport every summer of his life except
1944, when he was off in the Pacific flying bomber missions for the
Navy against the Japanese in World War II.
   Either Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, or his
deputy, Robert Gates, always accompanies Bush to Kennebunkport and
provides daily briefings on the latest U.S. intelligence from hot
spots around the world.
   ``Our forces are in Saudi Arabia on a defensive basis. They're
not involved in conflict, and there's not the need for any kind of
minute-by-minute or hour-by-hour update that might be necessary if
they were actually involved in combat,'' said Fitzwater.
   He said Bush's budget advisers also may make the trip to
Kennebunkport at some point to prepare for the resumption of
deficit-reduction talks with congressional Democrats in early
September.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``probably'' will return to Washington next
week for a briefing.
   Bush plans to fly to Baltimore Aug. 20 to address the Veterans
of Foreign Wars convention. He also plans to attend fundraising
events for several GOP candidates in New England during his
vacation.

<TEXT>
   Arab leaders gathered Thursday for an
emergency summit seen as a last-ditch diplomatic effort to end the
Persian Gulf crisis without outside military intervention.
   The summit, originally planned Thursday, was postponed a day.
The official reason for the postponement was some late arrivals.
   However, unconfirmed reports said the summit hit a snag because
the Iraqi delegation brought its own representative for the new
Baghdad-installed Kuwaiti government. Most delegates to the summit
reject that government.
   One of those arriving, the ousted Kuwaiti emir who is still
recognized by most Arab governments as the sheikdom's ruler, wept
as an Egyptian military band played the Kuwaiti national anthem.
   Senior Iraqi officials are representing Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, who appointed a Kuwaiti Cabinet loyal to him after his
troops swept away the royal government.
   President Hosni Mubarak's press secretary, Mohamed Abdel-Moneim,
told reporters that representatives to the summit would be arriving
as late as Friday, forcing delay of the meeting.
   Organizers said that of 21 Arab League countries, only Tunisia
and Mauritania were still absent late Thursday.
   Mubarak organized the summit to discuss last week's invasion of
Kuwait by Iraq. He said he hoped the meeting would forestall any
Western military attack to punish Saddam.
   The United States has sent troops and materiel to Saudi Arabia
as part of a multinational force to guard against possible threats
from Iraq.
   A source close to the summit told The Associated Press the Arabs
want to give Saddam a final chance to resolve the crisis peacefully.
   ``The Arab leaders want to do their duty by Iraq once and for
all, to give her a final chance to reverse what she has done,''
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``If this effort fails and there is no response from Iraq, then
he (Saddam) deserves what he will get. We are almost certain that
there will be an external strike against him. The question is
when.''
   On Wednesday, when he requested the emergency summit, Mubarak
warned Iraq would be the target of a ``harsh strike'' by Western
powers if it refused to withdraw from Kuwait.
   He said in the nationally televised speech that the summit
``would be better than having a solution forced on us by foreign
powers.''
   Answering his call, Arab leaders swarmed in Thursday, their
private jetliners lined up at Cairo International Airport like
limousines in a parking lot.
   Included in the Iraqi delegation were Taha Yassin Ramadan, first
deputy premier and a member of the ruling junta, and Foreign
Minister Tarek Aziz.
   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Kuwait's deposed emir, looked
weary and thinner than usual as he stepped in his white robes from
a blue-and-white Kuwait Airways jetliner.
   The playing of the anthem evoked tears from the emir and his
entire delegation. It symbolized the refusal of Egypt and most
other Arab states to recognize Iraq's appointed government in
Kuwait.
   On Wednesday, Iraq said it had annexed Kuwait. The U.N. Security
Council declared the move ``null and void'' on Thursday.
   The conference source said Egypt would demand that Iraq withdraw
from Kuwait and return al-Sabah to the throne held by his family
for more than 230 years.
   Egypt also would propose possible formation of a joint Arab
force to serve as a buffer between Iraq and Kuwait after Saddam's
troops withdraw, the source said.
   He said the proposed Arab force would not interfere with the
U.S.-led multinational force.
   The gathering is the first Arab League summit in Egypt since
October 1976. Egypt's membership was suspended in 1979 to retaliate
for its peace treaty with Israel. Mubarak has attended two Arab
summits since Cairo regained its League seat last year.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators moved Thursday to recover
$40.9 million from Charles H. Keating Jr. and five associates for
losses the regulators claim the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan
suffered from sour business deals.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision also demanded a complete
accounting within five days of Keating's personal assets as it
seeks restitution from the Arizona businessman and his associates.
   OTS Director Timothy Ryan said regulators do not believe
Keating's repeated claim that he went broke when his American
Continental Corp., the Phoenix-based holding company that owned
Lincoln, filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``There was just too much money available to him and to short a
time for it to disappear,'' Ryan told reporters at a news
conference. ``We believe Mr. Keating and his associates profited
from the improper use of depositors' funds and we want that money
returned to Lincoln.''
   The $40.9 million is sought from Keating and the five executives
either individually or as a group, Ryan said. It is the largest
amount sought in a thrift restitution proceeding.
   The administrative charges also seek to permanently bar Keating
and the five executives of American Continental from the thrift
industry and to remove them from the Phoenix-based company.
   The restitution is being sought to cover losses to the savings
and loan from three business deals that OTS attorney Richard
Delliveneri said were ``evidence of blatant disregard for the
safety and soundness of Lincoln Savings.''
   These include the $24.2 million Lincoln lost when a subsidiary
invested in a money-losing Detroit hotel and $4.4 million it lost
from the purchase and resale of Arizona desert land that regulators
say falsely inflated the thrift's profits.
   OTS also seeks to recover $12.3 million Lincoln lost to finance
the purchase of American Continental stock from Keating and others
by an employee stock-ownership plan.
   The business deals allowed Keating and his associates to take
tax deductions and enjoy other personal financial benefits,
regulators charges. Ryan said OTS was investigating other
transactions involving Lincoln and may file charges to seek more
restitution from Keating.
   The Irvine, Calif., thrift made heavy investments in the junk
bond market, losing $2 billion before it was taken over by federal
regulators on April 14, 1989. American Continental, which Keating
chairs, filed for bankruptcy protection a day before Lincoln's
seizure.
   Keating could immediately challenge in federal court the
temporary cease-and-desist order, which directs him to account for
his assets and bars him from transferring anything worth $5,000
without first informing OTS.
   The OTS charges will be heard by an administrative law judge in
late October, Ryan said. A final OTS decision can be appealed to
federal circuit courts.
   Besides Keating, the OTS charges were also filed against Judy J.
Wischer, president and chief executive officer of American
Continental; Robert J. Kielty, a director, senior vice president
and general counsel of the company; Keating's son, Charles H.
Keating III, an executive vice president and director; and two of
Keating's sons-in-law who are vice presidents, Robert J. Hubbard
and Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr.
   OTS also seeks their removal as American Continental officers.
   Bradley Boland, Keating's son-in-law and a spokesman for
American Continental, said Thursday that the six executives will
``take every legal opportunity that is available'' to fight the
charges.
   Boland scoffed at the allegations, calling them ``the same old
wine from the same old bottle'' and accusing OTS of political
grandstanding.
   A $1.1 billion racketeering and fraud suit filed in September
against Keating and his associates by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp. charges they fraudulently
diverted depositors' money for business dealings.
   Separately, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles is investigating
Keating's dealings at Lincoln.
   The Justice Department is also examining whether Keating
improperly donated $1.3 million to five senators who met on his
behalf with federal regulators in 1987, law enforcement sources say.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is reviewing allegations of improper
intervention with regulators by the five senators: Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and John Glenn, D-Ohio,
   An American Continental suit challenging Lincoln's seizure is
pending before a federal judge here.
   The second-largest restitution case is a $24 million suit filed
this year against Thomas Spiegel, former owner of the financially
troubled Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills,
Calif.

<HEAD>Former Chicago-Philadelphia FBI Agent Gets Pay-Plus-Pension
Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A black FBI agent who charged in civil suits
he was racially harassed by white agents will receive full pay and
pension benefits, possibly worth more than $1 million, under a
settlement of the case, his lawyer said Thursday.
   Attorneys for Donald Rochon, 40, and the FBI signed an agreement
this week that settles the three-year-old legal battle arising from
the black agent's charges he was harassed by white colleagues when
he worked in the FBI's Chicago office.
   The settlement is a further admission by the FBI of racial
problems in its ranks.
   Officials earlier this year acknowledged that the FBI had
settled three other racial discrimination suits, including one
involving 30 employees of the fingerprint identification division.
   The FBI announced the settlement with Rochon on Wednesday but
declined to give details.
   Rochon, who has been on disability leave since April because of
emotional stress, will receive full compensation and full pension
benefits under the terms of the settlement, said his attorney,
David Kairys of Philadelphia.
   Rochon will remain on disability leave until he is eligible to
retire in 11 years, Kairys said. As a result of the emotional
strain, ``he never wants to go back to the FBI,'' the lawyer said.
   The FBI has also agreed to award Rochon some back pay for a
promotion the agent claims he was unfairly denied, Kairys said. It
will also pay Rochon's former wife, Susan, a sum of money as
compensation, Kairys said. The attorney declined to disclose the
amount of that sum.
   But overall, the lawyer said, the entire settlement could be
worth more than a million dollars.
   The FBI also agreed to conduct a full investigation of Rochon's
claims and make public its findings by next April, Rochon said.
   Under the terms of the settlement Rochon will receive disability
payments under a finding by the Labor Department that he is
entitled to federal workmen's compensation for his emotional
distress, Kairys said.
   In addition, the FBI will pay the difference between the
disability insurance and what Rochon would earn if he remained with
the FBI. After a year of further leave, Rochon will be formally
separated from the bureau but will continue to receive raises and
get a pension when he reaches retirement age in 11 years, Kairys
said.
   Agents become eligible to retire on their 51st birthday.
   Rochon will be paid the average salary of FBI agents who joined
the bureau when he did in 1981, taking into account promotions that
some of his colleagues received, Kairys said. This provision of the
settlement gives Rochon the so-called ``front pay'' allowed in
civil rights law for employees who are forced to leave hostile work
environments.
   Rochon also received as $6,000 award to cover moving expenses
that the FBI originally refused to pay when he was transferred at
his request from Chicago to Philadelphia.
   Kairys said week-long negotiations ended with the signing of a
settlement agreement on Wednesday. Motions to dismiss the
complaints will be filed in federal courts in both Chicago and
Washington, where Rochon had suits pending.
   Kairys expressed surprise that the FBI had agreed to settle the
case after refusing to do in the past.
   Several years ago, the federal judge who presided over the
Washington case had urged Justice Department lawyers and attorneys
representing individual agents named in the complaint to settle the
case, but those talks broke down quickly.
   Rochon claimed his family received threatening telephone calls
and letters, including one that contained a picture of the
dismembered body of a black man. Another contained a bull's eye
superimposed with a picture of a black man.
   One white FBI agent, Gary W. Miller, acknowledged in a 1985
affidavit that he forged Rochon's signature on an application for a
death and dismemberment insurance policy for the black agent's
family.
   Another Chicago agent, Richard Ganslein, was recently added to
the suit in that city after the plaintiffs had discovered he had
admitted participating in the harassment, Kairys said.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis Describes Alcohol and Drug Dependency, Emotional
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Had Michael Dukakis become president two years
ago, Kitty Dukakis believes the pressure of life in the White House
would have sent her ``out of control.''
   In excerpts from her new book, ``Now You Know,'' Mrs. Dukakis
blames many of her problems on her mother, who was illegitimate.
Learning that fact was the turning point in her life, she said.
   ``Now You Know'' describes in greater detail the extent of Mrs.
Dukakis' already known addiction to drugs and diet pills. Her bouts
with depression and her struggles with these problems also are
futher revealed.
   ``I am certain the first crisis would have sent me out of
control. I am equally certain that, thrust into the smothering,
protective confines of the White House, I would not have been able
to seek proper help,'' she writes in excerpts from September's Good
Housekeeping magazine. The autobiography written with Jane Scovell
will be available early next month.
   Mrs. Dukakis said there were periods of heavy drinking during
the 1988 presidential campaign. She said she panicked before New
Hampshire's Democratic primary, because she realized her husband
might win.
   ``Michael was good enough to be president, for sure, but was I
worthy to be his partner? In my despair, I turned to alcohol,'' she
wrote.
   At one point after Dukakis lost to George Bush, she said her
son, John, found her unconscious in a bedroom, ``lying in my own
vomit.''
   The book describes her drinking habits after the election:
   ``On a typical day I would rise, wait till my husband left and,
by 9 o'clock in the morning, cancel all my appointments. I would go
to the liquor cabinet in the dining room, measure out three or four
ounces of straight spirits, and drink it down. Then I'd go
upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the phone, and read till I passed
out _ a process that usually took no more than 10 minutes. Two and
a half hours later, I would wake up and repeat the process.''
   Mrs. Dukakis blames her late mother, Jane Goldberg Dickson, for
much of her alcohol and drug addiction and for a long history of
low self-esteem.
   When she was 18, a cousin revealed that her mother had been
adopted. Later she learned her mother was illegitimate.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she was ``thunderstruck'' on learning that the
couple she and her younger sister, Jinny, knew as their
grandparents were her mother's adoptive parents. Her biological
grandmother had given up her daughter on one condition: That she be
allowed to live with the adoptive couple as a nanny.
   ``Why did you keep this from me?'' she demanded of her mother,
who replied, ``Well, now you know.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said it was ``an enormous breach of trust. That
traumatic moment haunted me for years,''
   Within a year, Mrs. Dukakis started using amphetamine pills that
she discovered in her mother's room, the start of a 26-year
addiction.
   She said her mother took many pills, including mood-altering
ones. She also said her mother had a fondness for alcohol.
   Mrs. Dukakis wonders if her addiction to pills was responsible
for four miscarriages she had during her two marriages.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who is taking lithium to control manic depression,
wrote that when she was hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol
last year, she was not suicidal, but depressed. She also said that
last December when she took a handful of Tylenol-with-codeine
tablets, she was just trying to get to sleep.

<TEXT>
   U.S. envoy John Kelly flew to Syria
Thursday to try to persuade that country to formally join
international sanctions against Iraq, diplomatic sources said.
   Kelly, the undersecretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs,
is the highest ranking U.S. official from the Bush administration
to visit Syria publicly.
   He was met at the aiport by Deputy Foreign Minister Nasser
Qaddour and U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian.
   The United States is spearheading diplomatic efforts to make
sure all nations isolate Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq is almost wholly dependent on oil sales for revenue. A
dormant Iraqi pipeline runs through Syria to the Mediterranean Sea.
   Syrian sources in Beirut, Lebanon, said Thursday that Iraq's oil
minister, Issam Al-Chalaby, came to Damascus this week to ask Syria
to reopen the line, but was refused.
   Syria and Iraq have a bitter rivalry going back 20 years. Their
borders have been sealed since Syria supported Iran in the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   Most of Iraq's 2.7 million barrels per day in exports flowed
through pipelines in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. That slowed to a
trickle after the United Nations imposed mandatory sanctions on
Iraq Monday.
   Turkey said it would respect the sanctions. Saudi Arabia has yet
to announce its position.

<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces shot and killed three rioters
Thursday during unrest over austerity measures that sent the cost
of food soaring by 300 percent or more.
   Soldiers patrolled the capital city of Lima in armored cars,
brandishing automatic weapons and wearing ski masks for fear of
retribution from rioters. The violence broke out after Prime
Minister Juan Hurtado Miller announced economic austerity measures
Wednesday night in a bid to ease the worst economic crisis in
Peru's history. On Thursday, the government announced a new
measure, saying it has decided to float Peru's currency, the inti.
   The price of gasoline, a government monopoly, jumped from 7
cents a gallon to more than $2. Private bus lines halted runs
Thursday, stranding thousands of people. Commuters fought one
another for room in the back of pickup trucks.
   Police reported looting in a dozen small street markets in
shantytowns that ring Lima.
   Police and soldiers opened fire and killed a man and a woman
among about 130 protesters who were burning rubber tires to block a
highway 10 miles east of Lima.
   In Ancon, a beach town 25 miles north of Lima, a Peruvian marine
shot to death a man involved in a fight with other shoppers at a
municipal food market.
   Tension in the capital had mounted in the days leading up to
Hurtado's announcement. Many shops doubled their prices even before
his address. Bread, noodles, beans, sugar, cooking oil and milk
disappeared from store shelves.
   The emergency economic package included elimination of subsidies
to cut a huge budget deficit, which Hurtado blamed for Peru's 3,000
percent annual inflation.
   The decision to let the currency float means its value will be
determined by supply and demand. The subsidized dollar cost only
about one-sixth of the free-market dollar in the final days of the
previous government of President Alan Garcia.
   Peru's inti is expected to quickly fall on the open market,
lowering the price of the country's exports on the world market.
However, the move will bring much higher prices for imported goods.
   ``The government must exercise leadership even if it means a
loss of its popularity,'' said Hurtado, who also is economy
minister in the new centrist government of President Alberto
Fujimori.
   Fujimori's predecessor, Garcia, was a populist who spent the
country's last dollar reserves before leaving office July 28.
   ``What we are suffering today was originated by a government
that treated us all like guinea pigs to try out its wonderful
theory that a nation can indiscriminately increase its deficit by
printing money without affecting prices,'' Hurtado said in a
television address.
   Weighed down by hyperinflation, Peru's economy shrank 20 percent
in the last two years. Four of five people are out of work.
   Starting now, Hurtado said, Peru's new government would not
spend more than it receives in tax revenues. He said public
services must charge enough to cover their costs.
   The emergency package also includes special taxes on the rich,
reduction of import duties to open up the economy to competition
from foreign goods, and a wage bonus for workers equivalent to
their July pay.
   Some observers have suggested Fujimori will have to use the army
to keep order in the face of the harsh economic measures. He named
two army generals to head the Defense Ministry and the Interior
Ministry, which controls the police forces.
   Most public markets in the capital were closed Thursday. Troops
were sent to Huancayo, a major commercial center 120 miles from
Lima, to prevent looting. Shops stayed closed in Arequipa, Peru's
second-biggest city, 465 miles southeast of the capital.
   The dollar doubled in value on Lima's parallel street market,
jumping from 200,000 intis to 400,000 in three days. On Thursday it
fell back to about 350,000 intis.
   During a brief visit Wednesday, Vice President Dan Quayle said
the United States supported Fujimori's austerity measures and
expressed confidence the reforms would ``put this country back on
the road to economic recovery.''
   He said the Bush administration was seeking congressional
approval for $160 million in military and economic aid for Peru in
1991.

   Americans strongly support President Bush's
decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia, even though most believe
the United States is headed toward war with Iraq, according to
polls released Thursday.
   Survey respondents also supported the embargo of Iraqi oil, and
many said they would accept higher gasoline prices to make it work.
But most blamed last week's jumps in gasoline prices on oil company
greed, not the embargo.
   Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait last week and annexed it
Wednesday. Bush dispatched U.S. troops to deter an Iraqi attack on
Saudi Arabia, explaining his move in a televised address to the
nation Wednesday.
   USA Today, in a survey of 610 people Wednesday, found that 81
percent supported sending troops to Saudi Arabia. CBS News,
surveying 773 people Tuesday and Wednesday, found 63 percent
approval. And a poll of 769 people Wednesday by ABC News and The
Washington Post found 74 percent support.
   However, the CBS poll indicated military action was not
Americans' first choice. Asked the best response to Iraq, 42
percent said ``hold off for the time being'' and 35 percent favored
using ``diplomatic and economic weapons.'' Just 13 percent favored
military force; the rest favored some combination, or were unsure.
   ``The bottom line is basically this is a popular action,'' said
Kathleen A. Frankovic, pollster for CBS. ``While there may be
clouds over the horizon, right now they're still in the distance.''
   Polls conducted on breaking news events tend to measure visceral
reactions, and the surveys found immediate fears of war were high.
Seventy-three percent in the USA Today poll said U.S. forces are
likely to end up in combat against Iraqi forces.
   Similarly, 66 percent in the CBS poll called it likely that the
situation in the Middle East will lead to an extended war involving
the United States. Twenty-two percent called that ``very likely,''
44 percent ``somewhat likely.''
   In the USA Today and CBS surveys, 49 percent favored using U.S.
troops to try to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Support for economic and
political sanctions was considerably higher.
   In the ABC-Post survey, 69 percent favored a naval blockade of
Iraq. But strong majorities opposed U.S. military strikes against
Iraq.
   On the oil embargo, 68 percent told CBS it was a good idea even
if it meant higher prices, and 50 percent said they would support
the embargo even if it made gasoline prices reach $2 per gallon.
Forty-nine percent told USA Today they would pay an additional 50
cents or more per gallon to make the embargo work.
   But most said the embargo was not the culprit in recent price
increases: Eighty-seven percent in the ABC-Post poll and 84 percent
in the CBS poll said gasoline companies were using the crisis as an
excuse to raise prices.
   The telephone surveys had error margins of plus or minus four
percentage points.

   Pentagon plans call for sending up to 250,000
ground troops to Saudi Arabia's defense in the face of a continued
Iraqi military buildup in Kuwait, Pentagon sources and
administration officials said Thursday.
   The substance of the military's so-called ``detail planning''
came as the White House hinted at a possible naval blockade to
choke off Iraq's oil exports in the face of its week-old invasion
of Kuwait.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that the U.S.
movement of troops continued on Thursday and would take ``many
days'' to complete.
   Williams declined to specify the force level the United States
intends to deploy.
   However, an administration official, speaking privately, said,
``There's a certain minimum force we have to put over there as a
deterrent. For now, we're marching ahead with it.''
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was prepared to put ``many divisions'' in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion
of up to 200,000 to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done,''
said this source, who spoke on condition that further
identification be withheld.

   Relief worker Emanuel Christen
arrived to an emotional homecoming Thursday after his release by
kidnappers in Lebanon, but he said his joy was tempered by thoughts
of a colleague still in captivity.
   Appearing thin but healthy, 33-year-old Christen bounded down
the steps of a Red Cross-chartered aircraft that arrived at Kloten
airport after a flight from the Syrian capital, Damascus. His
parents and four brothers and sisters rushed onto the tarmac to
embrace him.
   He was handed over to Syrian officials Wednesday after 10 monthsFellow
Swiss hostage Elio Erriquez, who was abducted
Oct. 6 with Christen, remains a captive.
   Before being
in captivity.  abducted, both men worked as orthopedic technicians
at a Red Cross hospital in the southern Lebanese port of Sidon.
   ``It's very difficult for me to accept that Elio is still in
captivity today,'' Christen told a news conference less than 90
minutes after arriving in Switzerland. ``We had hoped to be freed
together.''
   At his arrival, Christen was greeted by Swiss Foreign Minister
Rene Felber and Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International
Committee of thny who left Kuwait for
Saudi Arabia on Aug. 3, one day after the invasion.
   During the 75-minute drive, Whitaker said, Iraqi soldiers ``were
lined up all along the road and they had tanks. They had machine
guns and rifles. It was an army.''
   The group was stopped twice by Iraqi soldiers. The second time,
``I just acted like I didn't hear him and kept going,'' said
Whitaker, who returned Sunday to Abilene.
   ``There's no order back in Kuwait. Nobody goes to work, there's
no police, no services. We don't intend to go back there,'' said
Kimberly El-Zahr, 29. She, her husband, Camille, 33, and two young
children arrived Wednesday in Los Angeles after escaping
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The family plans to stay with relatives in
Oregon for now.
   The estimated 3,400 Americans still in Kuwait and Iraq left many
loved ones in this country ignorant of their whereabouts and
condition.
   Bush received high marks in the latest ``Pulse of America''
survey conducted in Lubbock County, Texas _ the president's adopted
sounding board for America.
   Sixty-four percent of 400 people surveyed Aug. 6-8 said they
would support Bush if he opted to use military force to push Iraq
out of Kuwait. Twenty-one percent did not support military use, 12
percent were undecided and 3 percent had no answer. The survey,
sent to Bush on Thursday, was conducted by Southwest Research
Associates and has a 4 percent margin of error.
   Laureen Utz Aljazireh, who moved to Kuwait from Springfield,
Minn., but was visiting American relatives at the time of the
invasion, also supports the president.
   ``I'm glad America is stepping in to stop (Iraqi leader Saddam)
Hussein before he continues into Saudi Arabia,'' she said. ``Living
in Kuwait, reading the newspapers there, you got more of a sense of
how powerful Hussein is.''
   Aljazireh's husband, Manhal, is an oil refinery engineer in
Kuwait, and she has not heard from him since the invasion.
   Bobby Parker, 48, is one of 38 Americans being detained in a
Baghdad, Iraq, hotel. ``I am very frightened for him and I'm
concerned for the troops and their families,'' said his wife, Lynda
Parker of Beaumont, Texas.
   All 38 were reported to be in good condition.
   Arab-American groups were divided in their reaction to U.S.
military action.
   ``We are U.S. citizens and we share the same concerns and feel
the same economic consequences as all citizens living in this
country. Furthermore, many U.S. Chaldeans have relatives still
living in Iraq. This gives us cause for even greater concern,'' the
Detroit-based Chaldean Federation of America said in a statement.
Chaldeans are Christian Arabs, mostly from Iraq.
   ``Our confidence is behind President Bush and the government of
the United States of America.''
   ``All it takes is a manufactured Bay of Tonkin or an accident
and we're in another Vietnam,'' radio and televison personality
Casey Kasem, who is of Lebanese heritage and often speaks out on
Arab issues.
   ``Gunboat diplomacy is not what the '90s is all about. Shooting
from the hip is not what the 90s is about. It's the age of
reason,'' he said.
   M.T. Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committee
and the National Council on Islamic Affairs, and about 30 other
Arab leaders held a news conference Thursday in New York City. The
metropolitan area has about 200,000 Arab-Americans.
   He said about 60 percent were anti-Saddam, about 40 percent pro,
but they unanimously opposed the American military deployment.
   ``We feel it will increase Arab and Muslim hostility to the U.S.
and only increase Saddam Hussein's prestige in the Arab world,''
Mehdi said. ``We're all convinced the route to a solution is
through the U.N., not the U.S.''
   Mehdi said most Arab-American leaders in the area favor economic
sanctions.
   Ten members of the American Friends Service Committee held a
vigil in Atlanta on Thursday to protest the U.S. military
intervention. Members of AFSC, a Quaker pacifist organization, said
they want Iraq out Kuwait but oppose American troops being sent to
neighboring Saudi Arabia.

   A preliminary check did not find any damage caused by the storm
to the exposed shuttle, but NASA planned to conduct a more thorough
examination of the spacecraft Friday, said agency spokeswoman Lisa
Malone.
   The newly repaired Columbia, which took Atlantis' place at the
launch pad, was not affected by the high winds and heavy rain.
   Atlantis' 3{-mile trip back to the hangar for repair of a
hydrogen leak took nearly six hours and ended around 4 a.m.
Thursday just outside the doors of the crowded Vehicle Assembly
Building. Shortly before 6 a.m., Columbia was rolled from the
structure and out to the pad.
   It was the first time two shuttles had passed one another in
upright launch positions.
   NASA intended to roll Atlantis into the hangar Thursday
afternoon, after Columbia had been secured at the launch pad.
Lightning in the area, however, prevented Atlantis from being moved
until Thursday night.
   Columbia was returned to the hangar in June because of a
hydrogen leak that was detected during fueling for a May 30 launch
attempt. The faulty fuel lines were replaced with components from
the new shuttle Endeavour, under construction in California.
   NASA plans to launch Columbia with the $150 million Astro
observatory around Sept. 4 or 5. Atlantis' classified military
mission, originally scheduled for mid-July, is now set for November.
   The space agency had planned nine shuttle missions this year,
but now is aiming for seven. So far, only three of them have flown.

deploying up to 250,000 troops; picks up 6th graf: ``Wiliams

   Thousands of American combat troops took up
defensive positions Thursday in the heart of Saudi Arabia's vital
oil-producing province as U.S. military strategists prepared to
fight a ``high intensity war'' on a vast scale.
   The Bush administration kept its official silence on details of
the U.S. troop deployment, code-named ``Desert Shield.'' President
Bush ordered the operation Monday, saying he hoped to deter Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein from sending his million-man army into the
kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter.
   At least 2,300 American ground troops landed in Saudi Arabia on
the first day of the deployments Wednesday, and Pete Williams, the
chief Pentagon spokesman, said ``there's much more to come'' over
the next several days and possibly weeks.
   ``This is an operation that is going to continue for several
days _ one might say many days,'' Williams told reporters.
   As the buildup of Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait swelled,
Pentagon and administration sources revealed that military leaders
have prepared long-range plans that could put 200,000 to 250,000
U.S. troops on Saudi soil.
   ``We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion
of up to 200,000 to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done,''
said a Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The
United States is prepared to put many divisions on the ground.''
   The sources said the plan would be evaluated at each step and
such a large force might never be necessary.
   ``Hussein's response will determine exactly how much combat
power we put on the ground,'' the source said. ``The idea of
deterrence is to place your forces so that they never have to be
used.''
   ``If deterrence fails and we fight, it will be a high-intensity
war with many casualties, many chemical casualties, much equipment
destroyed,'' the oficial said. ``It will mean warfare on a scale
that we haven't seen since World War II.''
   A force of 250,000 ground troops would account for a significant
fraction of the fighting power of the 940,000 active-duty troops in
the Army and the Amrine Corps. It would also require thousands more
in warships and airplanes in the theater of operations and in the
supply train stretching back to the United States.
   Williams said U.S. intelligence reports from the Middle East
indicated that Saddam was sending additional troops into Kuwait,
the tiny but oil-rich country his forces seized a week ago,
prompting international sanctions and the U.S. military response.
   Williams added, however, that there were no signs of offensive
operations by the Iraqis, who numbered about 120,000 in Kuwait.
   In a late-afternoon update, the Pentagon said if all Iraqi
combat units that were moving south in Iraq went as far as Kuwait,
they would increase the number of troops there to about 170,000.
   The statement said there ``seems to be some gathering'' of Iraqi
troops on the Turkish border but ``no significant gathering is
noted on the Jordanian border.''
   The Iraqi troops in Kuwait ``seem to be in a defensive
posture,'' he said. ``They're holding on to what they've
acquired.'' Williams also said he could not confirm reports that
Iraq had readied chemical weapons in the border area.
   The U.S. forces, though greatly outnumbered by a battle-hardened
Iraqi army, have sophisticated air and naval weapons designed to
shatter advancing armored columns that would have to cross desert
wastelands to reach Saudi oil fields.
   Diplomatic sources in the Middle East said elements of the U.S.
82nd Airborne Division, after arriving Wednesday at the Saudi air
base at Dhahran along the Persian Gulf coastline, headed for a
remote military installation near the Iraqi border.
   Williams said American troops were spending Thursday unloading
their equipment, preparing their defensive positions and planning
unspecified joint maneuvers with Saudi soldiers.
   In addition to a nine-ship U.S. navy armada plying the Persian
Gulf, two American aircraft carrier battle groups were stationed
nearby; the USS Independence, with six accompanying combatant and
supply ships, was patrolling the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the
gulf, and the USS Eisenhower, with three combatant and two supply
ships, was in the Red Sea near the end of a Saudi pipeline that
carries Iraqi crude. Not counting supply ships, at least 21 surface
warships were in the area or headed toward it.
   Williams said the three warships accompanying the Eisenhower
included one that was added on Thursday. He also said the USS
Saratoga aircraft carrier battle group, including nine vessels, was
headed for the Mediterranean Sea.
   The Pentagon spokesman said five U.S. Airborne Warning and
Control System aircraft were in place in Saudi Arabia, as well as
an unspecified number of F-15 fighter jets from Langley Air Force
Base, Va. The F-15 contingent was believed to include two
squadrons, or about 46 aircraft.
   The Middle East diplomatic sources, speaking only on condition
of anonymity, said at least portions of the American ground force
were settling in at the remote military installation at Hafr
al-Baten just south of the Iraqi border. The base is in the
al-Hajarah region, a stony plain traversed by the Trans-Arabian
Pipe Line, which extends 1,068 miles from the gulf coast to
southern Lebanon.
   The main landing for American aircraft is the Dhahran airfield
near the vital oil terminal at Ras Tanura. The main Saudi oil
producing area is part of an irregular plain ending in a ragged
coastline of tidal flats, sand spits and offshore sandbars.
   Extending over this plain and along the gulf coast are most of
the major oil facilities that process and export oil that is vital
to the global economy. Saudi Arabia is the world's third-largest
oil producer behind the Soviet Union and the United States. Because
of its small domestic oil needs, its export volume of about 5
million barrels a day is the largest in the world.
   Saudi Arabia provides about 15 percent of American oil imports,
making it the largest single foreign supplier.

   Iraq has virtually sealed its borders,
preventing thousands of foreigners from leaving that country and
Kuwait, Western European diplomats said Thursday.
   Some U.S., British and other Western nationals trying to leave
Iraq by road were stopped near the Iraqi desert border post of
Rutbah, said Arab travelers who reached Jordan.
   A Jordanian news report said a group of Americans who had been
transferred from Kuwait to Iraq were trying Thursday to cross into
Jordan. However, there was no independent confirmation of that
report.
   Despite earlier assurances that foreign tourists could leave,
reports reaching Rome indicated they were being turned back, said
an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   ``At the moment, the situation isn't very encouraging,'' said
the Italian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   British Foreign Office officials in Amman said only foreign
diplomats will now be allowed passage across Iraqi borders.
   In London, a British Foreign Office spokesman said he believes
the borders of Kuwait, which was annexed Wednesday by Iraq, are
also being closed by the Iraqi order.
   ``These were Iraqi frontiers, which I assume in Iraqi terms now
includes the frontiers of Kuwait,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi officials on Thursday notified Italian diplomats of the
border closing, Western European diplomats said. Italy holds the
current presidency of the European Community.
   Italy had asked that Iraq observe the Geneva convention
providing for the protection of civilians in occupied territory, in
this case Kuwait. The request, filed on behalf of Western countries
including the United States, also asked Baghdad to assure that any
foreigner who wanted to leave could do so.
   The Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq has trapped thousands of
Westerners in both countries.
   There are about 2,600 citizens of EC countries in Iraq. About
3,700 are in Kuwait, including about 3,000 British, according to
the Italian embassy in Baghdad. There are about 3,000 Americans in
Kuwait and 580 in Iraq.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Thursday that Iraqi officials have refused exit visas to Americans
and other foreigners in the two countries.
   U.S. officials have focused their concern on 38 Americans at the
Hotel Rashid in Baghdad. Almost all were bused from Kuwait by Iraqi
authorities last week and are confined to the hotel under armed
guard. But the State Department is refusing to call them hostages.
   Jordan's official Petra news agency said earlier Thursday that a
small group of U.S. citizens who had been transferred to Baghdad
from Kuwait last week were waiting at Rutbah for transport to
Jordan.
   The Petra correspondent allowed to reach Rutbah quoted Michael
Sabah, a stranded American, as saying he was rounded up with other
U.S. citizens in Kuwait after the occupation and taken to Baghdad.
   ``We stayed at one of the Baghdad hotels, and we were free to
leave any time. I am here with other Americans to find a U.S.
Embassy official to arrange our transportation to Jordan.'' His
home town was not given.
   There was no report of their situation late Thursday.
   A State Department spokesman in Washington said he knew of no
other group of Americans transferred from Kuwait besides the 38 at
the Baghdad hotel. However, he said it was possible another group
exists.
   The Italian official said Iraq initially agreed that foreign
tourists and those in transit at the time of the invasion could
leave. He said an initial wave of people, including many Japanese,
had been allowed to depart.
   Jordanian officials said thousands of foreigners, mainly Arabs,
had fled Kuwait in recent days. They entered Saudi Arabia and then
crossed the border into Jordan 60 miles southeast of Amman.
   The Italian official said, however, that foreign residents and
businessmen were considered to be in another category from
tourists, requiring special exit permits. He said those permits
were not being granted.
   Arab evacuees arriving in Jordan told The Associated Press
Thursday that Westerners trying to leave Iraq were stopped at
Traibel, a few miles before the Rutbah border post. Rutbah is 590
miles west of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   In Turkey, Harry Cole, head of the U.S. Consulate in the
southern city of Adana, said he waited at the nearby Habur border
post Thursday, but no U.S. nationals arrived there.

   Two gunmen disguised as policemen killed
the government's chief witness in the 1989 assassination of
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, police said Thursday.
   Jose Orlando Chavez and his brother were shot dead last Sunday
in a south Bogota neighborhood, a police spokesman said in a
telephone interview.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity, a standard practice of the
national police.
   Chavez had been questioned about being an accomplice in the
death of Galan, the governing Liberal Party's choice for president.
Galan's murder on Aug. 18, 1989 led to a crackdown on drug
traffickers.
   Chavez told police he was hired to hold up a large poster at a
Galan political rally. Assassins hid behind the placard until they
opened fire.
   Chavez was arrested but gained his freedom by cooperating with
authorities in the investigation.
   His testimony led police to the killers, the Bogota daily El
Tiempo said.
   The daily said information provided by Chavez led authorities to
conclude that the assassination was ordered by Jose Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, a major drug trafficker who died in a shootut with
police last December.
   According to El Tiempo, Chavez agreed to help in the
assassination after the cocaine cartel promised him a house and a
car.
   The newspaper said Sunday's attack was the second attempt on
Chavez's life. It said he survived eight bullet wounds from an
unknown gunman shortly after being released from jail earlier this
year.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs agents have impounded aircraft,
missile and gun parts and computers, satellite equipment and other
hardware bound for Iraq or Kuwait in the New York area and
Baltimore, officials said Thursday.
   Customs officials began impounding the goods on Sunday, the same
day FBI agents sealed Iraqi Airline offices in Manhattan, Detroit
and Los Angeles, FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said.
   Nearly $1 million worth of goods was held at Kennedy
International Airport this week, said Customs inspector Ed
Hotchkiss.
   It included 960 barrels of jet fuel, 23 crates of military
aircraft parts, three crates of radar equipment, 26 air
conditioning units and 21 boxes of personal computers. A small
shipment of radios to Kuwait also was impounded.
   At Port Elizabeth, N.J., in the New York area, Customs agents
seized $2 million in U.S.-made satellite equipment bound for Iraq,
said Customs spokeswoman Joan Baran.
   At the Port of Baltimore, two shipments of military equipment
bound for Kuwait in 190 containers was impounded, said Customs
spokesman Pat O'Malley. The shipments consisted of spare parts for
F-18 warplanes, Hawk and Sidewinder missiles, and guns, O'Malley
said.
   Another shipment of 36 containers was expected and would be
held, he said.
   ``All the documentation was in proper order. However, the
licenses have been suspended and there can be no export at this
time,'' O'Malley said.
   The value of the shipments was not immediately available, he
said.
   Anyone deliberately trying to circumvent the embargo declared by
President Bush following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 would
face criminal prosecution, Hotchkiss said.
   Most of the shipments were ``already in the pipeline'' before
Bush's proclamation, he said. No charges were expected against any
of the shippers.
   The goods will be held until the federal government determines
ownership, Hotchkiss said. Goods already paid for by the Iraqis
will probably be confiscated, while those still owned by U.S.
companies may be returned, he said.

   Burmese troops reportedly shot and
killed at least two monks and two students demonstrating Wednesday
in Mandalay, central Burma, on the anniversary of the 1988
pro-democracy uprising, Western diplomats said.
   They said the deaths could not be confirmed, but one said as
many as seven demonstrators may have been killed. One monk and one
student were reportedly wounded. Several people were arrested, a
diplomat said.
   The shootings occurred as thousands of monks, forming a line
three miles long, went on their morning rounds to gather food, the
Rangoon-based diplomats said.
   The diplomats were interviewed by telephone from Bangkok and
spoke on the condition of anonymity. They quoted sources in
Mandalay.
   One envoy said the demonstration appeared organized and was
``presumably intended to be provocative.''
   The 1988 insurrection closed schools and universities throughout
Burma. It ended six weeks later when the army shot thousands of
demonstrators.
   The morning alms ceremony is a Buddhist tradition, but one
diplomat said the monks usually gather in groups of 20 or 30.
   Students, including members of the National League for
Democracy, the major opposition party, joined the procession and
shouted slogans, diplomats said.
   One envoy gave this account:
   The shootings occured about 7:30 a.m., after one student raised
the red flag of a fighting peacock, the league's symbol.
   When security forces tried to restrain the student, a captain
was hit on the head with a rock.
   Troops then began firing.
   The league swept national elections on May 27, but the military
government refused to transfer power. Opposition leader Aung San
Suu Kyi is under house arrest and other prominent foes of the
government are in prison.

<HEAD>Filipino Sailors Win $32 Million Court Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a ruling described as the largest such
award in maritime history, a Japanese shipping company was ordered
to pay 21 underpaid Filipino sailors $32 million in back wages and
punitive damages.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner said the Delica Shipping Co.,
which admitted underpaying the MV Pine Forest's sailors on voyages
between Japan and the United States, had acted in a ``flagrant,
malicious, indifferent and unconscionable'' manner.
   In his ruling Monday, Tanner awarded the sailors $150,000 in
back pay, $15 million in compensatory and penalty wages and $17
million in punitive damages.
   It was by far the largest wage award in maritime history, said
Jim Lafferty, director of the New York-based Center for Seafarers'
Rights. The previous highest award was $2.6 million, he said.
   The Vanuatu-registered Pine Forest carries Douglas fir logs from
Weyerhaeuser Co. docks in Tacoma and Longview to ports in Japan.
   The seamen were recruited last year with employment contracts
that left blank a space indicating their wages, and later signed
shipping articles promising them higher wages under a collective
agreement with the Worldwide International Transport Workers
Federation, Tanner said.
   The sailors never got the higher pay.
   U.S. law gives federal courts jurisdiction over wage cases
involving foreign vessels and crews whose voyages end in U.S.
waters.

   A State Department task force has taken more than 11,000 calls
from people wanting information about Americans stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq, but word from the Middle East is reaching loved ones only
in dribs and drabs.
   Poor telephone connections and confusion in Baghdad have made
contact difficult if not impossible since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Some Americans said they heard about relatives through
employers or the State Department.
   Thirty-eight Americans remain in a Baghdad hotel from which they
are not allowed to leave, State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said Wednesday. The hotel is under guard, but the Americans
are safe, he said.
   He estimated there are 400 Americans in Iraq and 3,000 in
Kuwait. The task force is tracking 1,468 people in Kuwait and Iraq
it has identified or been in contact with, Boucher said.

   Few areas of the planet are more forbidding
for the American warrior than Saudi Arabia, home of the world's
largest sand desert, where the summer heat often tops 120 degrees
and can sap even the native tribesmen.
   Drinkable water is scarce. Sand and dust can debilitate not only
armies on the march but also aircraft, supply vehicles and gun
sightings on tanks and rifles.
   Add to that the threat of being attacked with poison gases you
can neither see nor smell, and you have a picture of the
peculiarities of mobilizing on the Arabian Peninsula to defend the
world's largest oil reserves from the Iraqi army.
   President Bush told the nation Wednesday that American forces

menacing million-man Iraqi army. The president said U.S. troops
would not initiate a conflict but would respond if attacked.

<HEAD>Government Plans to Punish Drug Users, Not Just Sellers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long after a drug pusher was shot
outside the nearby grammar school, the woman who runs the newsstand
in Dos de Mayo square caught her young son playing with a bloody
syringe.
   ``Thank God the needle was capped, otherwise he would have
jabbed himself,'' she said, her eyes on the drug dealers sitting at
their regular cafe tables. ``I've seen everything here, but that
really scared me.''
   Consumption of illegal drugs in Spain has grown to the point
that the government is drafting laws to punish users for the first
time since democracy returned in 1977. Laws passed three years ago
provide tough penalties for traffickers and money launderers.
   In 1983, soon after gaining power, the Socialist government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez lifted restrictions on the
possession of vaguely defined ``small amounts'' of drugs for
personal use.
   By deciding to change the rules, the government is tacitly
admitting Spain's drug problem is out of control. It also is a
response to pressure from other members of the European Community
partners to strengthen drug laws before the 12-nation trading bloc
abolishes internal borders in 1993.
   ``We are heading for a new situation in Europe and we need to
bring our laws more in line with those of other EC countries,''
said Santiago de Torres, deputy director of the government
anti-narcotics program.
   Spain is one of the main European entry points for Colombian
cocaine, Moroccan hashish and heroin from Turkey. Drugs confiscated
by Spanish police in 1989 made up 40 percent of the total in 16
major European countries.
   So far this year, Spanish police have seized more than 3,800
pounds of cocaine, 480 pounds of heroin and 10 tons of hashish.
They describe it as a small portion of the total entering the
country.
   The drug bill, which Parliament is expected to pass in
September, imposes fines for consuming narcotics in public,
discarding syringes or allowing drug use in public places like bars
and discos.
   Unlike Italy, which passed a new law earlier this year, Spain
does not plan to imprison drug users.
   ``We won't throw addicts in jail and scare them away from
treatment centers,'' de Torres said. He predicted Italy also would
not send drug users to jail, whatever its new law says, ``because
there's no room in the jails and they don't believe it's the
definitive solution.''
   Some Spaniards want to give police more leeway to clean up
drug-infested neighborhoods. They say dealers caught with small
quantities of drugs now avoid conviction by claiming it is for
their personal use.
   Half the 20,000 people at a recent protest in Barbate, southern
Spain, threatened small-time heroin dealers and painted ``Drugs
Sold Here'' on pushers' homes.
   People who live in towns near Gibraltar, a British colony,
demand that heroin dealers and addicts be expelled from the
country. They say Gibraltar is the base for drug smugglers who
supply Spain's southern Mediterranean coast.
   Agustin Sahagun, the conservative mayor of Madrid, called for
tougher public consumption laws after the owners of Archy, a
fashionable disco, claimed police had no grounds to close it for
alleged use of cocaine on the premises.
   Sahagun and other centrist and conservative politicians have
criticized the initial permissiveness of the Socialists.
   Gonzalez and many other Socialist Party leaders came of age in
the 1960s, when drug use was considered a protest against the
authoritarian rule of Gen. Francisco Franco.
   Enrique Tierno Galvan, the venerable Socialist mayor of Madrid
after Franco's death in 1975, once told a youthful audience to
``turn on and tune in.''
   Franco's tight control was enough to dissuade most Spaniards
from taking such advice. Now, few dealers in Dos de Mayo bother to
leave their tables when a patrol car pulls up at a cafe.
   ``Somebody would have to be pretty spaced out to do a deal here
now, but they can always go to some apartment,'' a woman officer
said. ``We can't go in there without a judicial order.''

   David Serafin, a dignified Oxford professor,
writes about a dentist who rides the subway with female mannequins
dribbling fake blood from their mouths.
   R.D. Zimmerman, a blond and boyish American, imagines a Russian
ax murderer who chops up his girlfriend's ex-lover just so he can
take over his victim's luxurious Leningrad apartment.
   And Susan Moody, a short, white English woman, creates a tall,
black female detective who sends aid to Third World countries from
the profits of her boyfriend's jewel heists.
   The unexpected, the macabre and the bizarre abounded at a
convention last month of crime writers dubbed ``Black Week'' in
this northern Spanish port. Sponsored by the city of Gijon and
several businesses, the gathering brought together more than 60
writers from 20 countries.
   They included ex-cops, journalists and former housewives, some
of whom had witnessed or lived through events stranger than the
most bizarre mystery story.
   One claimed to own a bullet-proof raincoat, another said he had
been taken for a harrowing ride by members of an Argentine death
squad and still another once saw a man throw a baby to its death
from the window of a New York apartment.
   The third annual convention united writers from the East and
West, including Americans who talked like Karl Marx and Russians
who sounded like Donald Trump.
   They gave talks, held meetings and exchanged endless war stories
over drinks in the sidewalk cafes that ring Gijon harbor.
   Jan Eik, a writer from East Germany, talked about German
unification and what it would mean for his future: more freedom but
less money. Under communism, Eik said, East German bookshops
offered a small selection of crime novels and his works sold out
rapidly.
   ``People bought everything in three or four days. Now, they can
buy any book they want,'' he said.
   Eik does not expect East Germans to buy a lot of crime novels in
the next few years because they will be busy purchasing Western
products that were out of reach under communism.
   ``People want new cars, video recorders and electronic
equipment,'' he said. ``These things are much cheaper now.''
   Twenty-nine-year-old Soviet author and editor Artem Borovik does
not write crime stories, but publishes them in a magazine called
Top Secret, which is dedicated to stretching the limits of glasnost.
   ``We call it `Top Secret' because it sells better,'' said
Borovik, who lived in the United States for six years and speaks
fluent English. ``Remember, this is the free market we're moving
towards.''
   Borovik, whose faith in capitalism appears unbounded, said
Soviet crime writers now have a new enemy to write about instead of
the American Central Intelligence Agency: ``The Communist Party of
the Soviet Union and the bureaucrats who do not want to turn power
over to the press and parliament.''
   Borovik may believe the CIA is no longer the enemy, but Cuban
writer Luis Adrian Betancourt is not convinced. His novel,
``Hurricane,'' tells of a Cuban who collaborates with a trio of CIA
agents who try to sneak on to the Caribbean island and sow
instability. In the end, the CIA loses and the forces of communism
triumph.
   Betancourt said he and a recognized Cuban poet once headed a
joint book-signing session in Havana. When Betancourt's books ran
out, the crowd left. ``I turned to the poet and said, `We Cubans
aren't very cultured. We buy spy novels and throw the real
literature in the trash.''
   Zimmerman, a 37-year-old who lives in Minneapolis, was shadowed
by agents of the KGB while traveling in the Soviet Union in 1978.
He was working as a guide for a U.S.-sponsored agricultural exhibit.
   He has incorporated his experiences in the Soviet Union into
several of his novels, which include ``Blood Russian,'' ``The Red
Encounter'' and ``The Cross and the Sickle.''
   Jesse Slattery, a crime writer who has worked as a New York Post
reporter for 17 years, talked about his bulletproof raincoat, the
time he got stabbed while reporting in Harlem and his dealings with
a woman who is considered one of the world's 10 best mercenaries.
   Author of ``The Julie Effect,'' he also reminisced about the
time he dove into a tank of sharks at the New York Aquarium just so
he could write a story about it.
   The protagonist of Susan Moody's novels is Penny Wanawake, a
tall, independent woman who always dresses in white and braids her
hair in beaded corn rows. When Penny gets angry, she shakes her
head and clacks the beads together.
   Moody, whose latest addition to the world of crime fiction is
called ``Playing With Fire,'' said she prefers not to emphasize
gore in her books. Far more important than the crime itself, she
said, is the unraveling of the mystery, the moving from clue to
clue.
   ``I'm not afraid of blood,'' she said. ``But I certainly don't
go into grisly descriptions of hideous decapitations.''

   If Mariah Carey had never been born, some record
company executive would have surely invented her.
   She has a seven-octave voice and looks and ambition well beyond
the whisper range. She also can write and arrange songs.
   The only question is why she had to wait until age 20 to hit it
big.
   ``For ... a year I couldn't pay someone to listen to my tape,''
explained Carey, whose debut single, the 1950s-styled ballad
``Vision of Love,'' quickly topped the charts.
   ``They think if you don't have a high-powered manager or don't
have a record company that's already interested in you, you're no
good. I had no connections and I was running with my writing
partner (Ben Margulies), who was also new and didn't have any
connections, either,'' she said.
   After working in bars and restaurants around New York, Carey was
signed by Columbia Records. She had been singing backup for Brenda
Kay Starr, a Columbia artist, and managed to get herself into a
party attended by company President Tommy Mottola.
   ``Someone grabbed him and told him to listen to the tape,''
Carey recalled. ``He got out in his car, played it, and turned
around and came back to find me. Everything worked out.''
   Dog owners beware, Carey's range is so powerful that the two
highest octaves are unintelligible to human ears. This is a voice
that can probably shatter glass and then put it back together, that
sounds as if she's taking the words and twirling them over her head
like a cowboy with a lasso.
   ``I was using my upper register on `All in Your Mind,''' she
said of one song from her self-titled album. ``What happened was at
the end of it, I did these vocal flips. When I was doing it, my
voice split and went into a harmony. If you hear it, it splits. I
was saying, `Get rid of that,' but everyone said, `No way, we're
keeping that.'''
   ``Mariah Carey'' includes 11 songs, most of them co-written by
Carey and Margulies. But if her life seems like a Cinderella story,
you'll have to listen hard for any Prince Charming here.
   ``I Don't Wanna Cry,'' ``All in Your Mind,'' ``Alone in Love''
and ``You Need Me'' are all about breaking up.
   ``So when the morning comes, you know I'll be gone,'' she sings
in ``Prisoner.'' In ``Vanishing'' and ``Love Takes Time,'' it's
already over.
   ``A lot of those songs were written when I was kind of
struggling, before I had a record deal,'' she said. ``It was a
harrowing emotional time in my life. I was doing odd jobs and going
towards this goal. They weren't necessarily all about
relationships, but they were about things happening in my life.''
   Narada Michael Walden, whose credits include Aretha Franklin and
Whitney Houston, produces along with Rhett Lawrence and Ric Wake.
Carey, who'd just assume look after herself, decided to accept the
outside help _ for now.
   ``They did put me with different producers that they wanted to
have me work with and this being the first album, I took a certain
amount of direction from the record company,'' she said. ``You
know, they are taking a chance. Ideally, though, I'd like to be
involved with everything.''
   Carey, born and raised in New York, is the daughter of Patricia
Carey, a former singer with the New York City Opera and a vocal
coach. Her parents divorced when she was young.
   Childhood was a waiting game for Mariah, a gospel fan who knew
she wanted to sing for a living at a time her classmates were
dreaming of being doctors or astronauts.
   ``I'd hang out with my friends and go to parties, and just be
stupid and goof off, but when I was at home, I was listening to
music and writing songs,'' she said. ``I would go and work with Ben
or whoever I was working with. I wasn't like an outcast being a
musician. I was like everyone else, but really I wasn't.''
   You can find aspiring singers or actors in just about any New
York restaurant, but Carey pushed for it just a little bit harder.
While her fellow employees were out partying after work Carey was
writing songs.
   Maybe she didn't make a lot of close friends that way, she
admits, but there was business to take care of, sweet destiny to
achieve. How long can you sit tight when seven octaves are just
bursting to get outside?
   ``I was doing all that because I wanted to get a record deal and
make an album,'' she said. ``I can hang out and do things that
aren't productive or I can make an album.
   ``Now, I like to take time out to go to a beach whenever I can,
spend time with my friends and family. I just wanted it all to
happen before it was too late.''

<HEAD>Photographer's Passion Plays Out in Jazz Pictures</HEAD>

   Herman Leonard's admiration for jazz and his
fascination with the people who play it led him to spend many late
nights photographing the musicians in dark and smoky clubs.
   ``I love to photograph interesting people, musicians, artists,
writers,'' Leonard said. ``I get to know them and photograph them
as I see them. This is my passion.''
   The results of that passion are the 45 photos capturing jazz
greats such as Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday and
Charlie Parker now touring the country in Leonard's ``Images of
Jazz'' exhibit.
   The exhibit will be in Chicago at the Catherine Edelman Gallery
until Aug. 18, on the fourth stop of a 10-gallery U.S. tour. The
photos also will be shown in seven cities in Europe.
   Leonard's photos capture the 1940s and '50s jazz scene. His
back-lighting technique plays light off the skin of many of the
musicians, highlighting the sweat on their foreheads, an occasional
smile of joy and frequent frowns of concentration.
   ``I wanted to get images that for me personally were
representative of the atmosphere,'' Leonard said in an interview.
   Leonard took the pictures in clubs around the world from New
York to Paris to Los Angeles. But it wasn't until the 1980s, when
he was living in Paris and a French publisher approached him about
putting together a book of his jazz photos, that he pulled them out
after almost 20 years of neglect.
   ``I'd put them in a cardboard box and stuck them under the
bed,'' said Leonard, whose photos were compiled into the 1985 book,
``The Eye of Jazz.''
   The 67-year-old photographer said age plays a big part in the
reaction people have to his photo exhibit.
   ``For the gray-haired guys, it kind of revives a memory,''
Leonard said. ``It's different for the teen-agers. They've heard
and loved the music, and it gives them a chance to feel what it was
like to be there.''
   The exhibit has attracted everyone from jazz buffs to parents
who try to explain who the musicians are to their small children,
said Catherine Edelman, owner of the Chicago gallery. She added
that Leonard's photos have such a mass appeal they are bringing a
new audience into her gallery.
   ``Jazz crosses barriers. It's a concept they respect,'' Edelman
said.
   ``But nothing really prepared me for the amount of love coming
out of people,'' she said. ``It's not just dealing with fine art.
People go up to each other and ask, `Hey, have you ever seen Dizzy
play?'''
   Edelman said she also sees Leonard's photos as a kind of visual
history.
   ``I think they capture a special time, a period we'll never be
able to return to,'' Edelman said. ``It's nostalgia. A record of
time gone by.
   ``It's very classic. The smoke, the atmosphere _ you can almost
taste these things. All of a sudden you want to put on some jazz.''

   Responding to the dramatic changes in Eastern
Europe, Roman Catholic bishops are sending fact-finding, good-will
delegations to that area, renewing ties and checking on ways to
help.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati said three
delegations will fan out to various parts of Eastern and Central
Europe to ascertain needs and coordinate aid efforts.
   ``These delegations represent the first major step in what the
bishops envision as a substantial program of aid by American
Catholics to the long-suffering church in those countries.
   ``Equally important, the delegations will be a key part of a
process of renewing and deepening bonds of solidarity ... bonds
that had been broken or severely weakened in the past decades due
to government interference.''
   One delegation, led by Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los
Angeles, visited Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria in early August. A
second, led by Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, N.J.,
will visit Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia Aug. 18-30. A
third, led by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago and Archbishop
John L. May of St. Louis, will visit the Soviet Union Aug. 27 to
Sept. 6.

street campaigns in New York each summer for the past 15 years,
says its campaign this time got bigger results than ever before.
   ``The spiritual receptivity quotient has shot way up,'' said
Tuvya Zaretsky, campaign leader. He said there were l,2l2 converts
and 2,798 others interested, compared to 568 converts last summer
and fewer before.
   He added: ``It's been like knocking your head against the wall

   Southern Baptist moderates have called a national
meeting Aug 23-25 to consider what to do in the face of a
fundamentalist wing gaining full-scale control of the huge
denomination.
   The gathering in Atlanta was called to explore ways to uphold
principles that differ with the new fundamentalist directions and
to consider alternate means for channelling giving to missions.
   ``I think we are ripe for God to use us in creating something
new and visionary and historic,'' said the Rev. Daniel Vestal of
Dunwoody, Ga., the moderates' defeated candidate in June for the
denomination's presidency.
   That victory by fundamentalists for the 12th year in a row
completed their gradual control over agencies of the 14.9
million-member denomination.
   A Houston-based moderate organization, Baptists Committed, and
Dunwoody called the Atlanta meeting as a growing number of
congregations across the country planned limits on giving to the
denomination's cooperative budget.
   Moderate discontent was intensified by the recent firing of the
top editors of the denomination's news agency, Baptist Press.
Indicating moderates have given up regaining influence over the
denomination, Vestal said they don't plan to enter a presidential
candidate in 1991.

   Once it became a public matter, United Methodist
bishops intervened and stopped it. But church blessing of same-sex
unions still goes on, some ministers say, but quietly.
   That is the nebulous aftermath in that denomination, with
similar inklings in others, after bishops in Washington, D.C., and
Wisconsin blocked plans for sanctioning such unions.
   ``By and large, it's done very quietly rather than publicly for
obvious reasons,'' said the Rev. George McLain of New York,
executive secretary of the Methodist Federation for Social Action.
   Despite such general statements, specific cases are hard to pin
down in mainline denominations, but it happens, and a woman pastor
in San Francisco says she implements it, in her own way.
   The Rev. Kim A. Smith, pastor of Bethany United Methodist
Church, said she has led several ``celebrations of commitment''
between couples of the same sex, and has talked with many pastors
who provided similar services.
   ``They have to be private about it,'' she said in a telephone
interview, declining, like others, to identify them. ``They have to
do it in secret. It can be dangerous for the pastor.''
   However, she said the particular terminology used was part of
the difficulty, with church authorities against phrases seen as
equating such ceremonies with ``holy matrimony'' or marriage.
   ``There are a lot of semantics around the issue,'' she said.
``It's very technical, a very fine line. That's what is being
tested. It's a wide-open question.''
   Ms. Smith chairs the national board of a ``Reconciling
Congregations Program,'' in which 46 United Methodist congregations
so far have committed themselves to provide full ministerial
services to homosexuals.
   She said she requires the same standards for homosexual as
heterosexual couples seeking church affirmation of their
partnership _ whatever it's called _insisting that they go through
preliminary counseling.
   Some homosexuals exchange rings, while others don't, she said.
``They commit themselves to long-term relationships. They're active
Christians, work, go to camp, pay their water bill. All they want
is what straight people have.''
   She noted four couples in her congregation have been together
for more than 30 years, two of them homosexual couples. However,
she said the ``dominant culture doesn't acknowledge this long-term
commitment'' between homosexuals.
   The issue came to a head last May when Dumbarton United
Methodist Church in Washington approved a new congregational
policy, affirming same-sex unions and announcing two lesbians would
exchange vows in a ``holy union'' ceremony.
   However, Washington Bishop Joseph H. Yeakel strongly objected,
and the planned ceremony was canceled.
   About the same time, Bishop David J. Lawson of Sun Prairie,
Wis., blocked a policy adopted by University Methodist Church at
Madison, Wis., for celebrating ``holy union'' of same-sex couples.
   ``What was happening now was outside the pale of the church,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   Some services there previously had joined same-sex couples under
a 1986 congregational policy recognizing same-sex relationships,
but disavowed that the joining of the couples was ``a substitute
for marriage,'' Lawson said.
   He said 1988 changes in the church's Book of Discipline made it
definite that the congregation had overstepped church law in a
planned liturgy for same-sex ``holy union,'' which was ruled out.
   Like most major denominations, United Methodism bars
self-avowed, practicing homosexuals from the ministry, and
specifies that marriage occurs only between men and women.
   However, the church terms homosexuals ``individuals of sacred
worth'' who need the church's ministry, part of which includes
validating marriages. But that service was blocked for homosexual
couples in the two cases.
   In Boston last February, the Episcopal parish of St. John the
Evangelist blessed ``the covenanting of relationship'' between a
lesbian couple, despite the opposition of Bishop David E. Johnson.
   Remonstrating parish priests for that service, Johnson said it
``was not an act of the Episcopal Church,'' which does not sanction
such relationships.
   Homosexual ties are openly condoned in some smaller
denominations, notably the Unitarian Universalist Association and
the mainly homosexual Metropolitan Community Church. It coined the
term, ``holy union,'' for such services, considering it equivalent
to marriage.
   Similar services with various wordings go on sporadically behind
the scenes in congregations of most major denominations, Ms. Smith
said, attributing that conclusion to conversations with other
ministers.
   However, as to the number of such congregations, she said she
couldn't guess. ``It may be a dozen, it may be a hundred,'' she
said.
   Asked if any United Methodists congregations were doing it, now
that the Washington and Wisconsin churches had been stopped from
it, Robert Lear, the church's Washington information director, said:
   ``You can always find (among the denomination's 38,000
congregations) a Methodist preacher that has done everything
irregular there is to do.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of all three countries have approved
the integration of Singapore with parts of Indonesia and Malaysia
in a compact economic ``growth triangle'' designed to attract
foreign capital.
   The idea is to present Singapore, the southern tip of peninsular
Malaysia and several nearby Indonesian islands as a single
investment center, not separate areas competing for capital.
   No formal treaty or European-style common market is planned,
officials said, but cooperation would mean uniform standards of
economic management and safeguards for investors in individual
projects.
   Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore proposed the
idea in December. His affluent city-state would seem, at first
glance, to gain more than its poorer neighbors from such an
arrangement.
   Singapore has only 2.7 million people and no hinterland. Its
growth is limited by insufficient labor, water and room to expand.
   Goh suggested the triangle could boom in the 1990s by combining
the land, labor, water and gas of Malaysia's Johor State and
Indonesia's Batam Island with the managerial talent available in
Singapore.
   As an added attraction, the area could be promoted as a sort of
``Caribbean tourist playground,'' Goh said, with beach resorts on
Johor and Batam and Singapore for shopping.
   President Suharto of Indonesia and Malaysia's prime minister,
Mohamad Mahathir, endorsed the idea in June when Suharto visited
Kuala Lumpur.
   ``We agreed that we should work together,'' Mahathir told
reporters. ``It will be beneficial for all three of us. We can
benefit from the prosperity and spending power of Singapore and the
spillover effect of its tourism industry.'
   Singapore had 4.8 million tourists last year.
   Government and private planning groups were set up last year
between Johor and Singapore, and earlier this year between
Indonesia and Singapore, to expand cooperation and streamline
customs procedures.
   As operating costs in Singapore soared in recent years, many
manufacturing firms shifted labor-intensive operations to Johor,
which is linked to Singapore by a causeway that carries a highway,
railroad and water pipeline.
   Another bridge is planned. Electronic components and other goods
shipped into Johor and later exported are not taxed.
   With costs increasing in Johor, Singapore manufacturers have set
their sights on Batam Island, a duty-free zone only 12 miles to the
southeast by ferry.
   Industrialists estimate the labor cost in Johor is about half
that of Singapore, and in Batam only half that of Johor.
   Two state-owned Singapore companies announced in January they
would put $220 million into a joint venture with an Indonesian firm
to build an industrial park, mainly for computer assembly plants.
The promoters said it would employ 40,000 people when completed in
five years.
   Politically, the triangle could help forge closer ties between
Singapore, most of whose people are ethnic Chinese, and its big
Malay neighbors, which experienced anti-Chinese bloodshed in the
1960s.
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said the joint planning showed
Singapore's neighbors realized they had more to gain by plugging
into the city-state's success than by trying to go it alone. Goh is
scheduled to replace Lee in November.
   Not everyone is so confident. Muhyiddin Yassin, head of the
Johor government, likes the idea in principle but insists his state
be a full partner, not ``a mere supplier of primary resources.''
   Tosrin Jarvanthi, a Johor state legislator, questioned
Singapore's sincerity: ``We have to examine the proposal very
closely to make sure that we will not lose out in future.''
   B.J. Habibie, an Indonesian government minister who oversees
Batam's industrial development, praised the triangle concept but
said Singapore probably stood to gain more than Jakarta.
   Frans Seda, a former Indonesian finance minister, saw great
benefits for Singapore, some gain for Batam and uncertainty for the
rest of Indonesia.
   The Straits Times took note of such sentiments in an editorial:
``The underlying fear, no doubt, is that Singapore would have not
have come out so enthusiastically and at such high level, in favor
of the idea if it did not stand to benefit disproportionately from
it.
   ``The government may thus have no choice but to maintain a
watchful eye over the whole project to ensure that Singaporeans
venturing to Johor and Riau (Batam) are good envoys as well as good
businessmen.''

   Within what is called the Russian Compound, in
the heart of Jerusalem, are two jails that symbolize the struggle
for this ancient land.
   One held Jewish guerrillas who fought British rule in the
Palestine of the 1940s. It is a museum now, with a plaque dedicated
to ``the heroes who fought against foreign rule.''
   The other, 300 yards across the compound, remains a jail, mainly
for Palestinians fighting Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. It has no plaques, just prisoners' tales of beatings,
torture and overcrowding.
   In the 1860s, the Russian Orthodox Church built the two yellow
brick buildings as part of a complex of hostels and a green-domed
church for pilgrims to the Holy Land.
   One day in July, dozens of Palestinian families crowded outside
the jail, a block-long, one-story building topped by rolls of
barbed wire. The Arabs call it Moskobiyeh, or Muscovite.
   An officer shouted the names of families who would be allowed to
visit prisoners _ four families at a time, 15 minutes per visit.
   Many waited for hours, some in vain. Any who asked questions
were pushed aside by officers.
   Sayra al Hamoni, a gaunt, 50-year-old woman from the Silwan
district of Jerusalem, said she had come to see her 17-year-old son
Bader, who was picked up two months ago.
   Mrs. Hamoni, her hair covered by the white scarf of observant
Moslem women, said Bader confessed to throwing stones at police
after being beaten for 19 days. His nose was broken and he was
often unconscious, said Mrs. Hamoni, who has eight other children.
   ``I brought him new clothes one day and they gave me the old
ones; they were all bloody,'' she said, wiping away tears. ``I get
sick each time I see him.''
   Betselem, an Israeli human rights group, issued a report
recently that said interrogators beat prisoners in the jail to
extract confessions. It said the report was based on affidavits
from Palestinians aged 18 and younger.
   ``Almost all the minors ... testified that they had been beaten
_ generally very severely: slapping, punching, kicking, hair
pulling, beating with clubs or with iron rods, pushing into walls
and onto floors,'' according to the report.
   It said some prisoners who were 16 or older told of
interrogations by the Shin Bet security service after being locked
in one of three special cells.
   Prisoners have given each of the cells a name: the ``closet,''
three feet wide and the height of a man; the ``grave,'' a box in
the ground covered by an iron door, and the ``lockup,'' a cubicle
about less than five feet square with a toilet inside.
   Najib, a 30-year-old Palestinian from Dheishe, a West Bank
refugee camp, told an Associated Press reporter he spent three
months in the Moskobiyeh, including several days in the ``lockup.''
   ``It was very dark; I was forced to sit in the lockup with my
hands tied behind my back,'' said Najib, who is tall and thin. He
said he refused to confess to charges that he was recruiting for a
radical PLO faction.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori denied the existence of the three
solitary-confinement cells. The Shin Bet has no spokesman to
question about its role in the jail.
   When asked about reports of beatings, Sandori cited a police
response to the Betselem report that was published with it in June.
   Superintendent Elinoar Mazuz said in it that all complaints of
police brutality were being investigated. She said police had not
finished investigating six of the eight alleged beatings of minors
Betselem cited and that files of the other two cases had been given
to the state prosecutor.
   Sandori would not let the AP reporter see any of the jail's 22
cells. He said only humanitarian groups were allowed to visit.
   Philip Veerman, a childrens' rights activist who toured the
youth wing in March, said it was seriously overcrowded.
   Eighty-three younsters were held in four cells with 34 beds,
Veerman said, and in one of the cells, 39 minors shared 12 beds and
one toilet. Two Israelis were held separately in one cell, he said.
   ``I almost fainted from the terrible smell,'' said Veerman, who
represents Defense for Children International. ``The air is stuffy
and it is difficult to breathe. In the night, mattresses are spread
out, but there is still not enough room.''
   In her response to the Betselem report, Ms. Mazuz acknowledged
``extreme overcrowding'' and blamed it on the increased number of
prisoners since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987.
She said the building was being renovated to create more space.
   Jews call the former jail across the compound Bevingrad, for
Ernest Bevin, Britain's anti-Zionist foreign minister of the late
1940s.
   As a museum, it is named ``The Shrine to Heroism.'' School
children visit it on tours and stare at the pictures of Jews
executed by the British before Israel was founded in 1948.
   Like the Moskobiyeh, the British jail originally was a hostel
for Christain pilgrims. Its 10 solitary-confinement cells are still
there and the gallows has been preserved, along with a death row
cell where two condemned Jewish guerrillas committed suicide.
   On April 21, 1947, Meir Feinstein and Moshe Barazani embraced
and ignited an explosives-filled orange pressed to their hearts.
They died two hours before their scheduled hanging.
   Another famous prisoner was Yisrael Eldad, who was co-leader
with Yitzhak Shamir, now the prime minister, of the Stern Gang
guerrilla group.
   Eldad, 80, said in a telephone interview from his home in
Jerusalem that he spent six months in Bevingrad in 1944 and was not
mistreated.
   ``Lots of Lehi people were there,'' he said, using the Hebrew
name for the Stern Gang. ``I was not even investigated. I was just
sitting in the cell with my friends.''

<TEXT>
   You say it's the long, hot, nasty-grindy part of
August and you don't know where to turn for a good movie?
   You say you've seen ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall'' is sexist
trash, ``Arachnophobia'' isn't scary, you READ ``Presumed
Innocent,'' your spouse IS a SEAL and Tom Cruise hasn't done
anything decent since ``Taps''?
   You say your clothes are sticking to you and you can't face the
crowds in the Downtown Cinema Hell Octoplex? You say Poogie the
Wonder Tot just stunned the cat with a sickening, underhand blow?
   Cheer up, America! Don't hit the kid! Hit the video store!!!
   It's not a lack of imagination keeping you away from network
television and the movie theaters. Really, it's not. Most of what
they're offering you this summer really IS dreadful claptrap!
   Home video, on the other hand, whether rented or store-bought,
is better than ever.
   You can own a $9.95 pre-owned copy of the Warren Beatty-Dustin
Hoffman comedy ``Ishtar,'' or, for about the same price, the
equally funny Good Housekeeping video ``Colors and Shapes'' for
young viewers like Poogie.
   Even if you bypassed VHS for an 8mm camcorder, the big video
stores are starting to offer new releases and old classics in 8mm,
from the Star Trek movies and ``Tucker'' to ``Moscow on the
Hudson'' and ``Gigi.''
   The 8mm format also offers digital stereo sound, higher
resolution than VHS, a smaller cassette and new releases priced to
sell at $29.95.
   Thanks to a glut of product and ``sell-through,'' where a hit
movie is released at a bargain price (usually from $14.95 to
$24.95), prices for most VHS releases are very reasonable. Most
popular movies on VHS are $19.95.
   For those of us who can't live without our own copies of ``Dr.
Strangelove,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon'' or ``The Producers,'' this is
good news.
   If you simply MUST own a copy of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' it's
available at $72.95 in VHS stereo and the superior ``letterbox''
format that maintains the wide-screen viewing aspect. It's a lot
cheaper to rent it, though.
   Two other new VHS releases worth mentioning are ``Blood Alley,''
with John Wayne and Lauren Bacall, and ``A Summer Place'' with Troy
Donahue and Sandra Dee; priced to sell at $59.95 and much cheaper
to rent.
   New VHS releases you'll have to nag your rental video dealer for
are Pier Paolo Pasolini's ``Accattone,'' at $79.95; Hiroshi
Teshigahara's ``Woman in the Dunes'' and Federico Fellini's ``I
Vitelloni'' are $59.95.
   Hold onto your money awhile if it's foreign film you crave.
Fellini's ``Satyricon,'' Akira Kurosawa's ``Ran'' and Jacques
Tati's ``Mon Oncle'' are selling for $29.95 this summer.
   Regrettably, the aptly titled ``Stuff Stephanie in the
Incinerator'' is holding at $79.95, but ``Slumber Party Massacre (I
and II)'' (``You Bring the Pizza, I'll Bring the Drill'') are
priced at $19.95.
   Laser disc releases in the stores this summer are more tempting
than ever. If you love movies and haven't bought a disc player,
you're missing out on crisp, clear images and crystalline, dynamic
``CD quality'' sound.
   ``Batman,'' which was too dark and cramped in its hastily dubbed
VHS version, sells for $39.95 on a beautifully transferred disc
version, in letterboxed format, with a digital stereo soundtrack
and Danny Elfman's score.
   There's also a wide-format ``Star Wars'' out there for $69.95,
and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in cut-down pan-and-scan LaserDisc
is only $29.95.
   VHS Colorized Classics priced at $19.95 include: ``The
Magnificent Ambersons'' (now there's an Orson Welles movie that
cries out for colorization even louder than ``Citizen Kane,'' eh?),
``The Maltese Falcon,'' and ``White Heat.''
   If you want to see an Arnold Schwarzenegger summer movie, why
not rent ``Predator'' or ``The Terminator,'' two excellent,
suspenseful action movies that take to the little screen as if they
were made for it?
   If you insist on a Bruce Willis actioner, go rent the original
``Die Hard.'' It sells for $19.95 and is available in wide-format
laser disc.
   If you want a Spike Lee movie, go rent ``Do the Right Thing'' or
``She's Gotta Have It.''
   Then rent Poogie the delightful ``Willie Wonka and the Chocolate
Factory,'' in which all sorts of nasty fates await wicked children
inside the wonderful chocolate factory. Heh, heh.
   It's not NICE to slug Mr. Kitty, Poog ...

   Elsewhere in television . . .
   `WE ACCEPT YOU, ONE OF US' _ That haunting refrain will engrave
itself into the bad dreams of a whole new generation in September,
when MGM-UA home video releases Tod Browning's ``Freaks'' for home
video at $19.98.
   The 1932 horror classic was disowned by MGM because it used real
side show folk; it was banned in Great Britain for 30 years. It
ranks with George Romero's ``Night of the Living Dead'' for dumb
dialogue and scary sequences.
   It's a fable about the circus, and of how a little man from the
side show falls in love with the beautiful trapeze artist who
deceives, exploits and abuses him. And it's about payback.
   It's also, for its 1930s ambience, a remarkably sensitive
treatment of the lives and feelings of exceptional people. And the
payback will scare the living willies out of you.

<HEAD>Soviet, U.S. Teachers Study Teaching Students to Live in
Democracies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty Soviet, American and Polish teachers
spent two weeks discussing educational alchemy _ how to turn the
leaden classrooms of pre-perestroika Eastern Europe into golden
laboratories of democracy.
   They talked about ways teachers can run their classrooms
democratically, and how students could be taught skills and
attitudes needed in a democracy. And they basked in the changes
brought on by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev himself has said, `We are a people who don't know
how to carry on a discussion. We are used to giving orders,''' said
Alan Shapiro, director of the Soviet education project of Educators
for Social Responsibility which co-sponsored the gathering here.
   ``What's missing is the culture of democracy. People are not
really accustomed to what the democratic process means, how long it
takes. Authoritarianism can be much more efficient.''
   Schools reflected that authoritarianism.
   ``Classes have been conducted more like a catechism. The teacher
asks the question and the student must give the right answer. You
could go through a lot of Soviet classrooms and never hear a
student ask a question,'' he said.
   At one point in the workshop, which ended last weekend, the
teachers sat in a circle, trying to name the world's most populous
countries. With give and take, they came up with the answers.
   Such a freewheeling exercise, as common in American classrooms
as chalk, was formerly unheard-of in Polish and Soviet classrooms.
   ``In the 1960s and 1970s I may have had that, but it would have
been risky,'' said Valentina Mitina, who taught for 22 years and is
now a researcher in comparative education at Moscow's Academy of
Pedagogical Sciences.
   The Flint meeting _ the third sponsored by the academy, Soviet
Educators for Peace and Mutual Understanding, and Educators for
Social Responsibility based in Cambridge, Mass. _ took place at a
time of rapidly increasing contacts between U.S. and Eastern
European educators.
   The Americans want to help U.S. students appreciate the
historical significance of changes in Eastern Europe. The Europeans
are looking to America for lessons in how to teach democratic
concepts and foster an inquiring attitude among students accustomed
to accepting lessons unquestioningly.
   The American Federation of Teachers has been particularly active
in fostering such contacts. Through the International Federation of
Free Teachers' Unions based in the Netherlands, the union has been
working with emerging free teacher unions in Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary.
   American universities have also been increasing their East bloc
ties. Clemson University announced plans in July to set up an MBA
program in Moscow. The University of Michigan announced in June it
is establishing a center for social research in Warsaw, Poland.
   Changes do not come easily. Educators who want to shed
dictatorial ways often face opposition from parents and students,
said Alexander Bannov, a school principal in the Siberian town of
Novosibirsk.
   They are afraid to have choices and participate in
decision-making because they don't want to take responsibility for
poor decisions, he said. In the old days, they could blame the
leaders.
   ``People are just not prepared for that. The process of
preparing our people to live in a democracy is a very difficult
pedagogical problem.
   ``If we just declare a democracy, nothing happens. It can lead
to anarchy. It (democracy) must be in every minute, in every
detail. We should not teach about democracy. We should live
democracy,'' he said.
   Gennady Belyaev, a Moscow teacher, is helping students write a
peace dictionary in which children develop their own definitions
for words such as trust and understanding.
   The class openly discusses the use of Soviet weapons by the
Iraqis on the Kurds, for example, as it shatters the assumption
that everything done by the Soviet Union automatically is good.
   ``We try to call a spade a spade,'' he said. He confessed his
main problem is freeing students from the fear of repercussions for
expressing their views.
   ``No one is going to go to the headmaster'' and report them, he
said.
   But Ruth Bowman, executive director of the Cambridge group, said
there are unexpected similarities between American and Soviet
students, and American teachers also are searching for ways to
teach citizenship.
   ``What I've learned from being with the Soviets is we seem to
have very common problems,'' Bowman said.
   ``This surprised me. They use the word apathy quite a bit. One
of the Soviet educators said her students want to be spoonfed. They
don't want to work for their learning. We're asking the same kind
of questions.''
   That made the institute a two-way exchange, rather than a
seminar taught by Americans for Soviets, she said.
   ``One specific thing I have learned is we are not as democratic
as we think we are and they are not as undemocratic as we think
they are,'' said Arthur Marquardt, an Adrian, Mich., high school
teacher.

<HEAD>Money Shortages Choking Reform in Big City Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, Philadelphia schools have offered students a chance
to study Latin as early as fourth grade. But this fall, fewer kids
will learn their ``amo, amas, amat's'': a tight budget has forced
the layoff of six out of 26 itinerant Latin teachers.
   ``An awful lot of them won't even finish high school, and the
only language they are exposed to is street language. This is the
one opportunity they have to get a little something beyond
that,''said one laid-off Latin teacher, H. Michael Dunn.
   Many such cuts, affecting both innovative programs and
day-to-day operations, await big-city districts across the country
this fall. A check by The Associated Press found that districts
from Philadelphia, Boston and New York to Dade County, Fla., and
Los Angeles face the worst fiscal problems since the mid-'70s.
   ``It's going to be tough to innovate when you're trying to
survive,'' said James Fleming, associate superintendent of Dade
County schools, a district that gained national notice for school
reforms but now faces a $108 million deficit that will likely lead
to more crowded classes.
   With a possible recession looming and worsening state finances
putting a squeeze on school budgets, big-city school officials
everywhere are bracing for teacher hiring freezes, layoffs, and
larger classes.
   ``It's a very bleak fall,'' said Jewell Gould, research director
of the American Federation of Teachers.
   He and others believe next spring could bring even worse news
when districts customarily send out layoff notices.
   One leading reformer called this fall's cutbacks fresh evidence
that political leaders give more lip service than resources to
school improvement.
   ``If snow is piling up in city streets, you get a greater sense
of emergency than if half the kids drop out of school year after
year,'' said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching.
   ``On the one hand, we say education is at the center of what we
hope for and dream about, and we almost get maudlin about it. But
then if something happens, it gets put off as `kid stuff,''' he
said.
   ``This is easily the worst fiscal crisis I have seen in the last
20 years,'' said Fleming of Dade County.
   State funding fell $44 million less than expected, said Dade
County school spokesman Andy Gollan. It's already meant elimination
of a merit schools program where schools devised innovative
programs to help students achieve educational goals.
   Philadelphia, anticipating deficits of $68 million for fiscal
year 1991-92, $170 million in 1993, and $275 million in 1994, has
put on hold reforms including full-day kindergartens, lengthening
the school day and year, and more classroom computers.
   ``It's come to a period where we have to make hard choices,
which are not necessarily popular choices,'' said Leontine D.
Scott, associate superintendent.
   In Boston, a $397 million budget approved last week is $6.4
million lower than last year's. Cuts include 100 fewer non-tenured
teachers, fewer school police, reduced extracurricular and
after-school programs, less funding for a city-financed parent
organization, and reductions in a private industry council that
provides jobs for high-school students.
   The city's schoolchildren are ``treated like second-class
citizens because they don't have the political clout that other
communities have,'' said Boston School Committee member Peggy Davis
Mullen.
   In Los Angeles, a $220 million budget gap earlier this year
forced extensive administrative cuts. The crisis worsened last week
when Gov. George Deukmejian announced he was withholding $465
million in school funds statewide, compelling the district to cut
$77 million more from the 1990-91 budget.
   School officials haven't decided yet how to parcel out the cuts.
But a number of reform ideas have already been shelved or reduced.
   A Bilingual Master Plan designed to help non-English speaking
students in all major subject areas has been only partially funded.
The district is also postponing expansion of its school-based
management program in which more than 60 schools participate.
   ``Devastating would not be too strong a word,'' said school
board member Rita Walters. ``It just socks it to us.''
   New York City's school board must come up with $26.8 million in
instructional cuts this fall after having already eliminated some
350 jobs at the central board.
   ``How that will be done is the unanswered question,'' said Susan
Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers.
   The district is likely to cut school aides and
paraprofessionals, measures that the union fears will put more
students in already-overcrowded classes. School officials insist
that won't happen. Kindergarten classes currently average 24.8
pupils, and high-school classes of 40 or more are not uncommon.
   Seattle's $243.6 million school budget has meant eliminating 165
teaching, administrative and other positions, mainly through
attrition.
   ``It's been a difficult time,'' said Seattle schools budget
manager George Steinhofer. ``We've taken a number of reductions in
central administration and this year we took reductions in special
education and bilingual programs. The only place left to look is in
basic educational programs.''
   New Orleans is closing two of its three centers for problem
students, and 60 school employees were laid off to balance the $358
million budget, said superintendent Everett Williams.
   ``That's been the story of our life in this school district for
the past four or five years. I have had no budget that's been an
even budget, where I have been able to start off the year with no
cuts at all,'' he said.
   In Houston, Superintendent Joan Raymond is pushing for a record
18 percent tax rate hike to fund a $797.9 million budget. The
proposed budget would provide a 10 percent pay raise for teachers,
31 new principals and deans, a dropout prevention program, beefed
up security, a principal performance incentive program and funding
of a massive construction program.
   But some taxpayers are resisting:
   ``By no extent of the imagination is the public going along with
this, '' said John Pellicciotti, a board member of the Taxpayers
Coalition of Greater Houston.
   Not all cities are in such dire straits.
   In Atlanta, public schools comptroller Lawrence Thompson said
the district has not had cuts. Next year's budget is $331.3
million, compared with $319.3 million this past school year.
   ``We've been pretty fortunate,'' Thompson said.
   Newark, with a $421 million school budget, has an $8.5 million
shortfall but has largely avoided layoffs. Some assistant
principals and other administrators may be demoted to save money,
said spokesman Kirk Smith.
   Next year, the district will get as much as $50 million in
additional funds as part of a state plan to boost the quality of
New Jersey city schools. But another state plan to shift teacher
pension costs entirely to local districts could cancel out those
gains, Smith said.
   In Detroit, an $889 million budget for the 1990-91 school year
includes such reform initiatives as expanded preschools and special
schools meant to help troubled ninth-graders avoid disciplinary
problems.
   A 5-mill property tax increase and a bond issue approved by
voters last September wiped out the district's $160 million deficit.

<HEAD>Primetime Producers Discover Benefit of Merchandising Their Shows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There's gold in them thar peaks, and Mark
Frost and David Lynch are not above trying to mine it.
   The richly textured ``Twin Peaks,'' laden with 14 Emmy
nominations and unchecked praise from TV critics, is going
commercial ... as in books, tapes, records, cherry pie and coffee.
   Yes, executive producers Frost and Lynch, who have tended to put
art above profit, want to make a bigger buck from their surreal
nighttime soap opera.
   The way they figure it, someone is going to cash in on the cult
following surrounding their saga of sex and murder (and dancing
midgets and a woman who carries around a log all the time), and it
might as well be them.
   Like their show, however, Lynch and Frost's approach is slightly
off kilter. This is not your average merchandising campaign of
T-shirts, hats and buttons.
   But, then, there is precious little that is ordinary about
television advertising and marketing campaigns these days. With
changing federal network regulations and an increasingly fierce
battle for viewers, the landscape of TV promotions is being plowed
under.
   CBS and NBC are launching mammoth commercial campaigns in
concert with such bastions of the American middle class as K mart
and McDonald's.
   Simon and Schuster will publish ``The Secret Diary of Laura
Palmer,'' the high school homecoming queen whose murder propelled
``Twin Peaks.''
   The book, written in 1{ months by Lynch's 22-year-old daughter,
Jennifer, will hit the stands in time for the Sept. 30 premiere of
the second season of her father's show. But that's not all.
   ``The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper,'' chronicling
coffee-guzzling FBI agent Dale Cooper's rambling cassette
dissertations to his secretary, will hit stores at about the same
time.
   Also in the works: a line of ``Twin Peaks'' coffee and cherry
pie.
   And while networks and individual programs are selling
themselves with an unprecedented fervor, it is for entirely
different reasons.
   The networks want to lure viewers. Program producers want to
make money.
   No one involved in primetime television merchandising for shows
such as ``Twin Peaks'' or cartoon superstars ``The Simpsons'' would
say how much they make from program products.
   But Playmates Toys Inc. sold $115 million last year in ``Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle'' items ranging from pizza to underwear. Trade
estimates put last year's income from merchandise inspired by
television and movies at $3 billion.
   In the case of ``Twin Peaks,'' ``we had some serious debate over
whether we should get into the commercial aspect of
merchandising,'' said Ken Scherer, chief operating officer and
``camp counselor'' of Lynch-Frost Productions. ``We figured, look,
other people are doing it so we might as well do it.''
   The ``other people'' Scherer was referring to are the unlicensed
sellers of ``Twin Peaks'' T-shirts cropping up in Los Angeles and
New York that read ``I Killed Laura Palmer'' and ``Who Shot Agent
Cooper?''
   Added Scherer, ``There's an awful lot of money out there for
other people'' who are illegally selling ``Twin Peaks''
merchandise. When independent production companies such as his
launch merchandising campaigns, Scherer said, profits are used to
enhance the quality of programming.
   ``The money that comes back you can put on the screen,'' Scherer
said. ``Independent production companies don't have the money that
big networks do.''
   Such producers may not have network-sized budgets, but they do,
for the most part, own the licensing rights to their shows. ABC,
CBS and NBC produce only a limited number of programs broadcast on
their networks, thus they have been barred from merchandising
specific shows.
   In November, that will change with the lifting of Federal
Communications Commission regulations that ban networks from
producing more than five hours of prime-time programming each week.
When the FCC ceiling is obliterated, ABC, CBS and NBC can produce
as much of primetime's 22 programming hours as they want.
   Television executives said the FCC rules change is likely to
result in networks playing a much larger role in merchandising
campaigns.
   Until then, however, the primary focus of the networks'
marketing strategy is getting viewers to watch their programs, not
selling them books, toys, key chains or coffee mugs.
   ``The power of advertising and television will reach thousands
and thousands of more people than will ever see a `Twin Peaks'
mug,'' said George Schweitzer, senior vice president of
communications for CBS Broadcast Group.
   CBS is repeating its behemoth campaign with K mart's 2,300
stores this fall. Last year, in the biggest television contest of
its kind, the eye network gave away 6 million prizes, from cars to
VCRs to coffee mugs.
   Attention, K mart shoppers: This year, CBS has upped the ante.
More cars will be given away, along with 10 million two-litre
bottles of Pepsi and a grand prize of $250,000 in MasterCard funds.
   According to Schweitzer, last year's campaign increased fall
premiere viewership by 28 percent. Players matched the numbers on
game cards obtained at K mart stores with figures broadcast during
certain CBS programs.
   The new campaign, which begins Sept. 26, is part of the
network's strategy to lure money-spending baby-boomers. CBS has
even signed The Temptations to sing their Motown hit ``Get Ready,''
but with eye network lyrics, in commercials promoting the fall
season.
   Product merchandising, Schweitzer said, is lucrative for only a
short time and only with giant hits such as Fox's ``The Simpsons.''
   ``These things are interesting as gimmicks,'' Schweitzer said,
``but they pale in comparison to the power of a summer's worth of
television commercials.''
   And, Schweitzer added, networks don't have to pay for their own
air time. ``Each network spends about $40 to $50 million a year''
on advertising in addition to production costs for in-house
commercials promoting their shows, Schweitzer said. ``If we had to
pay for air time, that would cost about $400 to $500 million.''
   Next month, NBC begins a $35 million contest with McDonald's
tied to its fall schedule, said John Miller, executive vice
president of marketing for the network. ``We've never done anything
quite this large before,'' he said.
   Probably because competition between the four networks, cable
and video rentals has never been this intense. Nor has viewership
in general ever dropped so much, according to ratings _ vehemently
disputed by CBS, NBC and ABC _ from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Still, ABC has hung back from the contest route taken by its
competitors.
   ``Ultimately, it's our philosophy that people watch the show
because there's something in the show that intrinsically interests
them,'' said Mark Zakarin, vice president of marketing for ABC
Entertainment. ``Our fall campaign really focuses on the stars of
our shows. No one watches a television show because of a singing
group.''
   The bottom line for network marketing strategies is that
contests and advertisements help get viewers to sample a new show,
but new car or no, viewers won't come back unless they like the
program.
   ``People watch TV shows, they don't watch fall campaigns,''
Zakarin said.
   Meanwhile, independent and studio-produced shows continue to
exploit merchandising as a way to make more money.
   There is a limit, however, to how far Lynch-Frost Productions
will go in selling ``Twin Peaks,'' Scherer said.
   ``We wouldn't sell firewood,'' he said, ``because the Log Lady
would never burn her log.''

<HEAD>The Going Looks Tough for Many Incumbent Governors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden's near-loss in a
three-way Republican primary last week is the latest evidence that
1990 is turning into a mean campaign season for incumbents.
   Voters have lots of reasons to be dissatisfied with government _
among them the savings and loan crisis, the federal budget deficit
and the weakened economy. Their discontent already is shaping some
of the 36 governor's races this year.
   ``There's a loss of confidence in government,'' said Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton, who is having his own difficulties as he seeks a
fifth term.
   ``There's a reserve of cynicism in the electorate for a variety
of reasons,'' said Mark Gearan, director of the Democratic
Governors' Association. ``There's a concern among incumbents. But
every state takes on a different hue and cast.''
   Hayden won renomination in Kansas by fewer than 8,000 votes and
3 percentage points, after trailing through most of a long night of
vote counting Tuesday.
   Hayden's political troubles stemmed from changes in the property
tax system that had resulted in big tax increases for many Kansans.
His predecessor, former Gov. John Carlin, who shared some of the
heat for tax changes dating back to his term, lost a comeback bid
and the Democratic nomination by fewer than 1,800 votes to Joan
Finney, veteran state treasurer.
   An incumbent's advantage is strong, through the ability to raise
money, generate publicity and use the powers of government. Yet
Kansas is hardly alone in its unease with incumbents.
   Next door in Nebraska, Republican Gov. Kay Orr is at the top of
the GOP endangered list as she seeks a second term.
   She's in trouble over tax increases and her belated admission
that taxes had indeed been raised. To bolster her campaign, she's
hosted visits from President Bush, Barbara Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle. Ronald Reagan is expected to show up, too.
   Another shaky Republican, Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, is
considered vulnerable because of his opposition to abortion, his
vacillation on taxes and general doubts about his management
ability. He's presented the Democrats with an opportunity to
capture the governorship of one of the largest states, and one that
will be a redistricting battleground next year.
   Democratic governors are having difficulty, too. Clinton in
Arkansas, James Blanchard in Michigan and Rudy Perpich in Minnesota
all have been in office for eight years or more and face their most
serious challenges yet.
   Nearly all the New England governors have suffered along with
the region's economy. And the three Democrats _ Michael Dukakis in
Massachusetts, William O'Neill in Connecticut, and Madeleine Kunin
in Vermont _ all decided not to run again.
   Meanwhile, Republican Govs. John McKernan of Maine and Edward
DiPrete of Rhode Island are trailing their Democratic challengers
in the polls.
   DiPrete's troubles stem not only from Rhode Island's flagging
economy but also from personal ethics questions. His favorability
rating has been as low as 17 percent in polls. While Democrats have
yet to select their nominee, DiPrete trails all three Democratic
contenders in one-on-one polling tests.
   Michele Davis, director of the Republican Governors'
Association, says she doesn't see a wave of anti-incumbent
sentiment washing across the governors races. Each, she says, is a
victim of individual or regional difficulties.
   ``I don't see it as an overarching theme or problem,'' she said.
``Each incumbent is judged by their own merits.''
   Clinton, however, says President Bush's break with his
read-my-lips pledge against new taxes has contributed to an eroding
confidence in government at all levels.
   ``He said X and now he's doing Y,'' Clinton said. ``It's hurting
not just him, it's hurting all of us.''
   In Clinton's case and a few others, another factor may be at
work: voters are just getting tired of the same names and faces.
   Clinton has been on the Arkansas political scene since 1974 _
and he's only 43 years old. He's been governor for 10 of the last
12 years, including three two-year terms and one four-year term
that ends this year.
   Now seeking a fifth term, Clinton is facing a strong challenge
from Republican Sheffield Nelson, himself the victor in a tough
primary. Polls show Clinton ahead, but Republicans say he fails to
get more than 50 percent in their polls _ giving them reason to
believe he is vulnerable.
   Blanchard won re-election in Michigan four years ago with 68
percent of the vote, but he faces a tougher test this time.
   He's leading Republican John Engler, majority leader of the
state Senate, but Republicans believe Engler is within striking
distance. Blanchard vetoed a restrictive abortion bill this year,
and abortion could emerge as a big issue in the race. To top off
his problems, his ex-wife Paula Blanchard, whom he divorced while
in office, has written a book about their marriage and has embarked
on a promotional tour.

   It looked like a television game show
setup, replete with hundreds of spectators, a gavel-bashing host
and a raucous band that exhorted the audience to applaud the best
players.
   But the business at hand in the Newport Marriott Hotel wasn't a
contest for winning cash, cars or washer-dryers. The players were
homebuyers and investors, and the prizes were prime pieces of New
England property, sold at auction by developers under pressure
because of a weak real estate market.
   Auction day was a Saturday afternoon in late July, with about
500 people jammed into the ballroom of the hotel in this quaint
waterfront town known for its swank mansions, sailboat racing and
summertime jazz.
   Most prospective buyers already had toured the properties to be
auctioned, two fancy-sounding subdivisions named Butterfly Estates
and Weekapaug Bluffs in nearby Rhode Island communities. The units
for sale ranged from empty lots to townhouse condos.
   Prospective bidders came to Newport with the plot numbers of
their favorite sites in hand, hoping to win one at a fraction of
the original asking price.
   The bar outside the ballroom didn't do much business, just a few
beers and glasses of wine. Inside, a three-piece combo played while
auction-goers milled about discussing the sites.
   After company president Steven L. Good outlined the proceedings,
auctioneer Gordon Green led the group through a mock-auction as
bid-spotters worked the crowd. The practice auction involved
Newport mansions, and the phony bids were in the millions.
   Green managed to keep the crowd, for the most part quiet and
reserved, laughing and interested.
   ``With a name like Weekapaug Bluffs, these lots have got to be
good,'' he said.
   Weekapaug, in the coastal town of Westerly, was built in 1988
when the value of oceanfront property was rising dramatically. The
units are within walking distance of two golf courses and have a
view of Block Island Sound.
   Bidding started at $65,000 on the Weekapaug Bluffs condos,
originally priced at $285,000 to $325,000. Offers shot up to
$140,000 in 25 seconds. Two minutes later, the first auctioned unit
sold for $142,000.
   The next went for $140,000, and after that prices leveled off
around $138,000. Forty-five minutes into the auction, the units
were being snapped up for about $131,000.
   To the auctioneer's left, signs representing the auctioned units
were moved from the ``Available'' board to the ``Sold'' sign.
   After each winning bid, the band would strike up a jaunty tune
as the buyer moved to the front of the ballroom, like a game-show
contestant receiving a prize. The crowd clapped.
   After the buyer filled out the necessary paperwork and put down
deposits, he was escorted to the ``mortgage rooms'' on the other
side of the floor to work out details with representatives from
Rhode Island's Fleet National Bank, which offered financing.
   Dennis and Debra Rider, of Enfield, Conn., claimed the seventh
unit sold for $137,500. The Newport auction was the first for the
Riders, who bought the Weekapaug Bluffs property as an investment
and don't plan to move there.
   ``We got caught up in the excitement of it all,'' Dennis Rider
said later. He ended up paying about $2,500 more than he wanted to,
``but we got the style we wanted.''
   Why did they do it? ``The price and the willingness of the banks
to work with us,'' he said.
   When the day was over, Sheldon Good &amp; Co. had pulled in $4.6
million in total sales, said company spokesman Terrence Kaye. That
included 21 condos sold at the Weekapaug Bluffs site, and 31 of 34
plots of land at Butterfly Estates.
   The Butterfly lots, in the town of Lincoln, originally were
priced at $100,000 to $400,000, but went for $50,000 to $82,000.
   Some prospective buyers left disappointed they hadn't ventured
any bids.
   ``We considered buying,'' said Cleve Elswick of Warwick, R.I.,
``but it was a little bit higher than what we wanted to pay. Of
course, the prices went down.''
   Nonetheless, Elswick, who works in real estate, and his wife,
Ruth, came away with a newfound admiration for property auctions _
mainly because there weren't any pushy real estate agents in bright
blazers shoving contracts in their faces.
   ``Here you have total control of yourself,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Here's a general buyer's guide to real estate auctions, based on
advice from experts in the field:
   _ Read the papers, get on a list. The Sunday newspapers are
usually jammed with advertisements in real estate sections for
property up for auction. Also, auctioneers can put you on their
mailing lists and provide a calendar of sales. _ Get a brochure.
The auction company will send you material that provides basic
information on the property, such as total square footage and the
latest asking price. Photos are included.
   _ Learn the lingo. Auctioneers have a language of their own. For
instance, an ``absolute auction'' means the property will be sold
to the highest bidder regardless of price, while an auction with
``reserve'' means the owner can reject even the highest bid. A good
real estate lawyer or accountant can help. _ Inspect the property.
Most auction companies have open houses at least a week before the
auction date. If none is planned, ask for permission to see the
property beforehand. In cases of multiple units up for auction find
out if you'll be seeing more than just models.
   _ Ask questions. You'll want to know what's included in the
property _ such as kitchen appliances or carpeting _ or how long
any remaining tenants will be occupying a residence. At the site
you'll get even more information like a sales contract, an
engineer's report, floor plans or financing details. It's a good
idea to have a lawyer or accountant look the deal over.
   _ Register. To make a bid you must register with the auction
company. You should do this only after you or your lawyer have
completely evaluated the property. Registered bidders will get a
``bid card'' that entitles them to participate in the auction. In
addition, auctioneers require that you bring a cashier's check or
money order.
   _ Arrive early, listen. At the day of the auction, usually held
away from the property, try to arrive an hour early to ensure a
seat. Listen for any announcements prior to the auction's start,
such as changes in the property or terms of the auction.
   _ Hang on to your seats. Usually there will be a practice round
of bidding to give first-time participants a feel for the
auctioneer's tempo and the bidding process. When the auctioneer is
ready to begin, you'll hear ``Do I have an opening bid?''
   _ Be ready to pay. The highest bidders are required to sign a
real estate sales contract when the bidding is concluded. Your
cashier's check is taken and used as ``earnest'' money. At that
time, bidders may have to increase their ``earnest'' money to the
required percentage amount, usually 10 percent of the bid.

<HEAD>Modern Pirates Prey on Shipping in Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Piracy, the centuries-old scourge
of the sea, is making a comeback in Brazil.
   Brazilian authorities have been unable to stop modern buccaneers
who raid cargo ships and terrorize crews in ports along the
southeastern coast.
   ``Piracy is getting worse and more violent,'' said Joao
Dilermando Goncalves, chief fleet inspector of Lloyd Brasileiro,
the country's largest shipping company. Pirates have attacked three
Lloyd ships in Rio this year.
   The new pirates are different from the sneak thieves who always
have plagued merchant ships, Goncalves said.
   ``These are highly organized gangs of up to a dozen armed men,''
he said. ``They intimidate the crew and break containers open _
real heavy assault.''
   Although today's pirates use speedboats, Uzi submachine guns and
radio communications, their methods have changed little from the
days when buccaneers prowled the South American coast in sailing
ships.
   A typical attack occurs at night, when most crew members are
ashore.
   ``One of the gang tosses a grappling hook and rope over the side
or climbs up the anchor chain,'' Goncalves said. ``He overpowers
the duty officer and lowers the ship's ladder, just like in the old
days.''
   While some of the raiders hold the crew at gunpoint, others go
for the cargo. They take cables, binoculars, bearings,
chronometers, electronic appliances, even the ship's compass.
   Goods containers are a favorite target.
   ``They know beforehand what's inside,'' said Helcio Muniz,
president of the National Union of Merchant Marine Officers. ``They
only go for the containers that have valuable cargo.''
   Crews are virtually helpless, Muniz said. Ship rules do not
allow crewmen to carry guns, and the deck watchman the unions
require also is unarmed.
   Piracy became a serious problem in Brazil about two years ago,
said Meton Soares Jr., president of the National Union of Shipping
Companies.
   Brazilian ports are as dangerous as Singapore, Hong Kong and
Bangkok were decades ago, before economic prosperity brought
improved security, he said in an interview.
   About 40 percent of pirate attacks in Brazil occur in Santos,
Latin America's largest port, about 280 miles southwest of Rio,
Soares said.
   Last year, 55 ships reported losses from piracy in Santos, but
many others were attacked and did not bother to file complaints, he
said.
   ``The federal police began acting with rigor there,'' Soares
said, ``but piracy continues and now it has spread to Rio.''
   Rio is ideal for such marauders. Ships awaiting dock space ride
at anchor for days in the middle of the Guanabara Bay, miles from
land, and are easy prey.
   Pirates gravitated to Brazil centuries ago because of its
4,593-mile coastline and many natural ports. The word ``buccaneer''
is from a French term for early pirates who used the ``boucan,'' a
Brazilian grill for roasting meat.
   English and French pirates raided Portuguese coastal settlements
in Brazil as early as the 16th century, and later attacked ships
carrying gold and gemstones to Europe. They were not driven off
until the 19th century.
   Lloyd Brasileiro has strengthened its duty watches and improved
on-board lighting to combat the latest outbreak of piracy. Anchor
hatches are covered and the ship's ladder is raised at dusk.
   Goncalves said there even was a suggestion to put left and right
shoes in separate containers of export footwear to discourage
pirates. But he admitted the precautions were not enough.
   ``The problem is the bays are not policed,'' he said. ``We need
armed, uniformed naval vigilance.''
   Robbery on the sea is the responsibility of federal police, but
they don't have boats and patrolling harbors is difficult.
   ``Police don't have the equipment to act on the water,'' Soares
said. ``By the time a pirate attack is reported, that's often as
far as it gets.''
   Vice Adm. Sergio Doherty, director of coasts and ports for the
Brazilian navy, said neither the navy nor police was equipped to
fight piracy.
   ``What we need is a Coast Guard, like the United States or
Argentina,'' Doherty said.
   The government shelved a proposal to create a coast guard in the
early 1980s.
   Soares said the police ``have enough problems fighting crime on
land,'' and he sees little chance of curbing piracy soon.

   Piracy is a terrifying threat to defenseless
refugees fleeing Indochina, but the International Maritime Bureau
says it is a declining nuisance to shippers in most parts of the
world.
   Shipping companies face greater losses from damage to cargo or
injuries to crews, said bureau director Eric Ellen, but piracy
remains a risk.
   Pirates steal yachts in the Caribbean, perhaps intending to use
them for drug smuggling. Vietnamese refugees are brutally attacked
in waters off Thailand and crew members on giant tankers sometimes
are victims of armed robbery.
   Ellen said whole ships are stolen in the Philippines. ``You can
steal a ship to order, put the crew overboard or take them along if
you want them,'' he said in an interview.
   Government functionaries can be bribed to provide the ship with
a new name and call sign, and ``what you develop is a phantom
ship,'' Ellen said. ``These ships with new identities can pick up
cargoes, and then steal the cargo. It seems incredible, in this day
and age, that a ship can just disappear.''
   ``If it was an aircraft,'' he said, ``every airport in the world
would be alerted. There is no such system in the maritime world.''
   The bureau, a branch of the International Chamber of Commerce,
is trying to update a world survey on piracy completed in 1988, but
finds statistics hard to come by because ``very few incidents are
officially reported,'' he said.
   According to Ellen, a truer picture emerges from reports of the
``protection and indemnity clubs'' shippers form to insure
themselves against loss.
   He mentioned reports he had seen of hundreds of attacks on
yachts in the Caribbean, compiled by a yachting magazine.
   Soviet and Israeli vessels generally are well armed, but Ellen
said many ships have little defense other than the captain's pistol.
   ``Quite honestly, we don't have a good response to vessels that
are under attack,'' he said. ``There is no maritime police service
that can get to you in time.''
   After the Palestinian hijacking of the Italian passenger liner
Achille Lauro in 1985, during which an American passenger was
killed, the bureau urged seaports to install airport-style security.
   Only the port of London did so, and there ``is a remarkable
degree of complacency'' at many others, Ellen said.
   The most vulnerable people at sea are refugees fleeing Southeast
Asia by boat.
   Pirates attacked 37 boats in the first half of 1990, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees headquarters in Geneva reported. It
said at least nine refugees were killed and 266 were missing.
   Eighty-four boats were attacked last year, with 18 people
confirmed dead and 734 missing, the refugee office said.

<HEAD>Entomologist Says Americans Should Eat More Bugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM McCALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What has a nutty flavor and looks like
brown scrambled eggs?
   Bakuti. That's Nepalese for squished honeybees.
   What looks like ridged french fries, only with eyes and legs,
and tastes great deep-fried?
   Bamboo worms.
   Yuk, you say? How about a nice helping of honey instead?
   Sorry to disappoint you, but it's really bee barf.
   OK, so maybe you can deal with the truth about honey. But that's
not all. Most Americans don't realize they're already eating a
pound or two of insects every year.
   You just can't see them because they're ground up into tiny
little chunks in your strawberry jam, peanut butter, spaghetti
sauce, applesauce and frozen chopped broccoli.
   The insect parts even add to the protein, making some products
more nutritious, said Michael Burgett, an entomologist at Oregon
State University.
   He estimates every acre of land in Oregon contains about 100
pounds of insect protein. In tropical areas, it's about 400 pounds.
   Burgett bemoans the fact that most of the protein is going to
waste. Except for that extra touch of tartness in the jam on your
English muffin, of course.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says there is no way to
eliminate all bugs from our food, so it sets what are called
``defect action levels'' to control the amount of insect parts,
rodent hairs, molds and other tiny particles that pose no health
hazard.
   ``Essentially, the FDA is saying you can only have enough bugs
so you can't see them,'' Burgett said.
   ``We have an innate bias against insects I blame on our European
heritage. For our culture, insects are outside the realm of food.
The glaring exception is honey, which is bee vomit, essentially.
It's a plant product mediated by an insect.''
   Burgett is an internationally recognized expert on bees. He
respects bees. He is fascinated with their behavior.
   And, he said, they make delicious cookies.
   ``A pound of bees is about 3,500 bees. You put them in the oven
at low heat for eight hours, then grind or blend the dry husks into
flour. Makes great cookies. About half my students ate the cookies
the first year I made them. Most of them said they didn't taste any
different. So I cheated the second year and put in `Grape-Nuts' to
make them crunchy.''
   But if you really want crunchy, the giant waterbug is the
appetizer of choice. Roasted and eaten whole, it's a favorite in
Asia, said Burgett, who's sampled a variety of insect fare.
   ``You'll find that Asian cultures have incorporated insects in
their diets for a long time. One of the most popular insects in
Asia is the giant waterbug, which is like a big cockroach. It's
easily collected around lights at night, especially around ponds.''
   In Thailand, you can judge a restaurant by the bugs on the menu.
   ``In Thailand, about 50 species of insects are commonly eaten.
That's a lot. And they're eaten by a broad spectrum of society.
I've gone to very nice Thai restaurants and they have excellent
insect dishes on the menu,'' Burgett said.
   American consumers are so finicky about bugs they'll never eat
them, Burgett said. At least they won't ``mass consume'' them in
the numbers needed to make bug ranching a solid commercial success.
   ``They've talked about using termites in the Northwest. Highly
nutritious with high protein content per body weight. But who's
going to eat them?
   ``Bee keepers in western Canada kill their bees in the fall
because it's too expensive to keep them through the winter. They
restock from Southern California in the spring but all those bee
pupae are going to waste. The major hurdle, again, is who wants to
eat it? There is a gourmet market in Japan for the male pupae of
the honeybee, but that market is small.''
   If people won't eat cooked bugs, no matter how tasty and
nutritious, at least they could tolerate more bugs in what they do
eat, Burgett said. If the FDA would relax the limit for insect
parts, say double it, U.S. farmers could significantly reduce the
amount of pesticides sprayed every year.
   ``Snap beans are a perfect example. The 12-spotted cucumber
beetle takes tiny little bites out of the beans. It doesn't harm
the bean but consumers want perfection. So the growers spray the
beans to rid them of beetles and bite marks. When growers drive up
to the food processing plant, people sample the beans and bite
marks, and if the ratio is too high, the company will tell the
grower, `We'll have to process this batch differently,' so the
growers makes less money.''
   Farmers are spraying less because pesticides costs are rising
and alternate pest management strategies are working, Burgett said.
Much of the spraying that remains is for appearance, and that won't
change until consumers stop being so squeamish about bugs, he said.
   ``If you say, `I don't want any bugs in my food, and I don't
want any insecticide residue,' then we'll all starve,'' Burgett
said.
   ``I'd rather eat more insects and less pesticide residue,'' he
said.
   Will consumers agree? Burgett is a pessimist.
   ``Consumer acceptance is a big problem. Fifty years ago, it
wouldn't matter if an apple had a moth larva inside, or if the bean
had a beetle bite. Are these people shopping for flawless apples
willing to pay the price for less insecticides? I think not.''
   But he has advice for environmentalists and consumers who want
to reduce the pesticides in our food: ``Bug the government.''

<HEAD>Gallbladder Removal Avoids Incision, Speeds Recovery

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeons have started using a new way to remove
a gallbladder: They pull it out through a hole smaller than a dime.
   Patients can leave the hospital in a day or less, and return to
work much faster than after standard surgery, surgeons say.
   The new technique also saves money and hurts less, they say.
   Surgeons are scrambling to learn the procedure, and they may use
it for a quarter of gallbladder removals by 1992 and 75 percent by
1994, Kenneth Abramowitz, a health care market analyst with Sanford
C. Bernstein &amp; Co., predicted.
   ``Right now, patients are flocking to the physicians'' to get
the new operation, said Nashville, Tenn., surgeon Douglas Olsen, a
pioneer in the technique.
   Gallbladder removal, used to treat gallstones, is one of the
nation's most common surgical procedures, done more than 500,000
times a year.
   The new procedure is called a laparoscopic or endoscopic
cholecystectomy. As with a regular gallbladder removal, the patient
is put under general anesthesia.
   Standard surgery has then called for an incision of 4 to 6
inches in the abdomen, although recently some surgeons have reduced
that to 2 or 3 inches, Olsen said.
   The new procedure avoids any such incision. Instead, the surgeon
makes two quarter-inch punctures and two half-inch punctures. One
hole goes in or near the navel, one below the breastbone and two
below the ribcage on the right side.
   The surgeon slips surgical instruments into the body through
sleeve-like tubes in the holes. One instrument contains a tiny
video camera so the surgeon can watch his progress on a screen.
   Using the instruments, the surgeon grasps the bag-like
gallbladder, cuts it free with a laser or electric cauterizing
device, and performs other follow-up procedures. Then he pulls the
gallbladder out through the navel puncture.
   Olsen said he usually concludes by putting a single stitch in
the navel and a few absorbable stitches in the other puncture
sites. Once the holes heal they resemble minor skin blemishes
rather than a surgical scar, so women ``can still wear their
bikinis,'' Olsen said.
   The surgery avoids the injury to muscle and associated tissues
that comes from a standard incision, so recovery hurts less and
proceeds faster, surgeons say.
   Rather than spending five to eight days in the hospital, most
patients go home in a day or less, said Olsen. He said he does it
as an outpatient procedure; some surgeons hospitalize the patient
overnight.
   And rather than waiting four to six weeks to return to work, the
average patient needs only five days to a week, Olsen said.
   ``I've had people go back to work the following day after their
operation, and that's not unusual,'' said Olsen.
   ``Patients almost immediately feel their energy return'' because
the body needs not spend energy on healing tissues from the
standard surgical incision, said Minneapolis surgeon Leonard
Schultz.
   ``This is a patient-led revolution in health care,'' Schultz
said. Insurance companies ``are now being deluged by patients
saying, `I want this operation.'''
   For his patients, insurance companies that require pre-surgical
authorization usually grant it for the new procedure, he said.
   About half the nation's 74 independent Blue Cross and Blue
Shield plans cover the procedure, although the national association
has made no recommendation on coverage, a spokeswoman for the
national association said.
   Some other insurance companies cover the procedure, too, said
spokesman Donald White of the Health Insurance Association of
America. ``It is in fact a widely accepted technology.''
   He recommended that people contemplating the surgery contact
their insurance companies.
   Schultz said the cost of hospitalization plus the surgeon fees
may come to about $7,000, or about $1,000 less than for standard
gallbladder removal. The faster return to work also cuts disability
payments, he said.
   While people talk about high technology boosting health care
costs, ``here technology is helping to bring down costs,'' he said.
   Some surgeons express cautions. Dr. Paul Ebert, director of the
American College of Surgeons, said about one in 20 patients who go
under anesthesia for the new surgery wake up to find that a
standard procedure was done instead.
   That occurs when the surgeon discovers severe scarring or some
other problem that rules out the new procedure. The college
recommends the new procedure be done by surgeons qualified to do a
standard removal.
   The odds of an unexpected switch to standard surgery may decline
as doctors learn to identify patients with such problems ahead of
time, Ebert said.
   He also said complications and long-term outcome from the new
procedure have not been documented, though initial indications
suggest they will be about the same as with the standard procedure.
   ``The more of these I do, the more I realize there may be
certain inherent problems of this operative procedure that still
need some refinement,'' Schultz said. ``I think we've made it 99
percent safe. We've got 1 percent to go.''
   Dr. Charles McSherry, director of surgery at New York's Beth
Israel Medical Center, recommended selecting a surgeon carefully.
He acknowleged it is very difficult for patients to get first-hand
information on the skills of a particular surgeon.
   ``As best they can, they should certainly do whatever they can
to check out the individual to see that he's experienced, and see
what his reputation is in the community with his surgical
talents,'' McSherry said.
   While gallbladder removals have gotten much attention from
surgeons and patients, the technique has also been applied to other
operations. Gynecologists use it routinely for a number of
procedures.
   Surgeons have also used the technique to remove the appendix.
And following hernia repairs with the new technique, Schultz said,
patients take a couple pain pills and go back to work in two days.
   ``This blows my mind,'' he said.

   Two days after Cyndi Newman's gallbladder was
removed, she was cheering at a Little League game and lifting her
toddler out of his crib.
   ``It's hard to believe you can have an operation and not need
pain medicine,'' said the 30-year-old mother of three.
   Sandra Ludwig, 39, gave an engagement party and went shopping
the weekend after her surgery. The message on the answering machine
at her northern Virginia home says: ``Hi, this is Sandra, a modern
medical miracle. I'm out venturing around.''
   And Ken Beswick, a United Nations official, went shopping the
day after his operation and gave a presentation in Washington two
days after that.
   Newman, Ludwig and Beswick are among several thousand people
around the country whose doctors have removed their gallbladders
using a new technique called laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
   About 500,000 people, two-thirds of them women, have their
gallbladders removed every year.
   Most still are removed using traditional surgery, which requires
four to six days in the hospital and three to six weeks of
recuperation.
   Traditional surgery also leaves a 4- to 6-inch scar, similar to
the prominent scar President Lyndon B. Johnson displayed to the
press after having his gallbladder removed at the Bethesda Naval
Center in 1965.
   Belly-button surgery was brought to this country from France a
year and a half ago by Dr. Eddie Joe Reddick of West Side Hospital
in Nashville, Tenn. Physicians use thin, elongated instruments and
a tiny video camera on the end of a probe to remove gallbladders
through a half-inch incision in the navel.
   ``Ninety-eight percent of our patients are in the hospital for
less than 24 hours. They're able to return to normal within three
to five days,'' said Dr. Karl A. Zucker at the University of
Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.
   Last fall, Zucker and his colleague, Dr. Robert W. Bailey, began
using an electric cauterizer, instead of an expensive laser, to
seal blood vessels and veins. The technique, using a common
surgical tool, popularized the operation. They estimate about 5,000
surgeons nationally have learned the new procedure.
   Patients marvel at how well they feel almost as soon as they
wake up from the anesthesia.
   Ludwig, a therapist at a community health center in Springfield,
Va., said she was so anxious she had called Zucker frequently
during the two months before her operation. ``I woke up, all I had
was these little Band-Aids.''
   Beswick, 59, had his gallbladder removed at University of
Maryland Medical Center on his way back to Argentina from a
conference in Canada.
   Three days after the surgery, he gave a presentation in
Washington. Five days later, the chief technical adviser in Latin
America for the International Atomic Energy Agency had flown for 18
hours back to Buenos Aires without discomfort.
   ``It's certainly the way to have one's gallbladder removed,''
Beswick said. ``You feel a little bit tender around the navel,
that's all. Stiffness more than anything. The first couple days you
have to be little bit careful when you stretch and straighten up.''

   A promising new magazine aims to combine good
eating and eating well.
   With just its premiere issue out, Eating Well seems to have
found a niche with an attractive format, brightly written stories
both serious and funny and recipes that should appeal to relatively
well-off people who care about their health but cringe at tofu
burgers and pickled seaweed.
   Eating Well created ``a lot of excitement'' at the recent
National Nutritional Foods Association show in Boston, said Sara M.
Starr, vice president of HealthFocus, a consulting firm for the
healthy foods market.
   Too many health magazines, she said, are ``bland, brown and
boring. They don't make food fun.''
   ``I think it's a good idea, and I just hope they remember that
one of the biggest parts of eating well is tasting good,'' New York
restaurant consultant Clark Wolf said. ``We are just recovering
from the nubby, dirty health food trends of the '70s.''
   Well, there is a story about yogurt, and all the recipes include
the nutritional content. But with stories about designer beef, the
Napa Valley, Calif., estate of vintner Robert Mondavi, and even
Southern cooking, the first issue could hardly be classified as for
stereotypical ``health food nuts.''
   ``I am looking forward to an article on butter,'' Wolf said.
   Not to be found in the first issue. There is, however, the very
funny story of a woman who very wrong-headedly decides to go into
the chocolate business, partly to rationalize her binges. And the
distressing journey of a fish from its capture off Washington state
as a rockfish to its sale a week later as fresh red snapper in an
Iowa supermarket.
   Editor Barry Estabrook, 38, became interested in food journalism
when his doctor told him his cholesterol was too high. He changed
his diet, but ``at the same time, I don't want to give up
interesting food,'' he said from the magazine's office in
Charlotte, Vt.
   Eating Well is published by the Canadian company Telemedia and
is a sister publication to Harrowsmith Country Life. It was the
result of water-cooler conversation among the staff, many of them
approaching age 40, Estabrook said.
   ``People started to talk about cholesterol levels, their parents
having heart conditions and their own children's nutrition,'' he
said. ``These are people who had been talking about Club Med
vacations and real estate in the '80s.''
   Eating Well, Estabrook said, fits between food magazines that
``blithely pour on Devon cream'' and the health magazines that
``shoehorn a food article in if they have the space.''
   ``Once the land of meat and potatoes, North America is in the
midst of one of the most significant shifts in eating habits in
modern history,'' Publisher James M. Lawrence writes in his
introduction to the first issue.
   With 144 pages, Eating Well has, predicatably, advertisements
for spring water, Simple Pleasures, fancy kitchen cabinets, Lean
Cuisine and Land's End. Its newsstand price is $2.95, and
subscriptions for six yearly issues are $12.
   The difficult market for magazines _ while food magazines have
prospered, Cook's magazine recently folded _ has not dissuaded
Eating Well's publishers, who are guaranteeing paid circulation of
225,000 the first year, Estabrook said.
   This may be in part a result of the audience the magazine seeks:
``well-educated people who are not going to sit around and let the
woes of middle age take over them,'' he said.
   ``There is a real genuine interest among people in their own
health. It's one of things they have control over,'' Starr said.
``You may not be able to control the economy or the environment or
the new taxes we're all going to get, but you can control what you
put in your body and how it makes you feel.''
   Eating well, Starr said, ``is not a special interest any more.''
   Said Clark, ``Let's truly eat well. Eating well used to mean
fois gras and caviar. Now it's a lot more complex. ... Let's make
sure the `well' means more than just cholesterol levels.''

<HEAD>New Danger Found in Destruction of Tropical Forests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have identified a new threat to the
atmosphere with the discovery that the burning of tropical forests
is releasing large amounts of nitrogen into the atmosphere.
   Tropical forest destruction has been known to contribute to the
warming of the Earth's atmosphere by the release of carbon dioxide.
As carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the atmosphere traps
more of the sun's heat, giving rise to the so-called greenhouse
effect.
   A study reported in the current issue of the journal Nature
finds that the burning of tropical forests also is releasing
significant amounts of nitrogen, some of it in the form of nitrous
oxide _ a potent greenhouse gas.
   ``Nitrous oxide put into the atmosphere by biomass burning is a
greenhouse gas 250 times more powerful (molecule for molecule) than
carbon dioxide,'' said Joel S. Levine of NASA's Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va., in a commentary on the new study.
   The burning of tropical forest ``biomass'' is also releasing
nitric oxide, which contributes to pollution and is the fastest
growing component of acid rain, Levine said.
   The study was directed by Paul J. Crutzen of the Max Planck
Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Less Depressed if Expected to Do Well,</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Study Says
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing home residents became less depressed
when their caregivers were given rosy _ but bogus _ predictions
about their progress, a study says.
   The residents also became more dependent on help for performing
day-to-day tasks, researchers said.
   Both changes may have occurred because the caregivers spoke more
warmly to them and physically helped them more, researchers
suggested in the July issue of the Journal of the American
Geriatrics Society.
   The study focused on 63 elderly people newly admitted to six
nursing homes. They were randomly assigned to a high-expectancy
group or a comparison group.
   Nurses and aides were told that members of the first group could
be expected to do better than average compared with other residents
with the same sorts of problems. No such prediction was given for
members of the comparison group.
   On average, members of the experimental group showed a decline
in depressive symptoms within three months, while those in the
other group showed an increase. But the high-expectancy residents
became more dependent on physical help, while the other group
became less dependent.
   Previous research has linked increased helping by caregivers to
a decrease in functional abilities, the researchers said.
   Study authors were from Harvard University, Beth Israel Hospital
in Boston and the Brockton-West Roxbury Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Boston.

   A day after reaching their highest level in nearly five years,
oil prices sank under the prospects that many oil-producing nations
could pump plenty of crude to prevent shortages from further Iraqi
aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the cost of crude for
September delivery plummeted $2.35 to settle Wednesday at $25.96 a

   A number of utilities called Wednesday for energy savings
programs to help curb oil consumption. The American Automobile
Association hopes to tell its 32 million members how to cut down on
gas consumption because the average price nationally for self-serve
unleaded has jumped 16.2 cents a gallon in a week.

   The sudden jump in oil prices may not
create any abrupt increase in demand for coal, but mines may
receive a needed boost if oil remains high.
   Coal doesn't compete directly with oil and U.S. utilities cannot
quickly switch from oil to coal in power plants, John Gresser of
the National Coal Association said Wednesday. But the industry is
positioned well to hike production if other countries switch fuels.

   Amid fears higher energy costs could shock the soft economy into
a recession, the Fed survey released Wednesday showed the economy
growing but at a slow or slack pace. And the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce predicted that even without higher energy costs, the
economy would grind to a standstill during the current quarter and

<HEAD>Broker Suspended for 2 years in Thayer Inside Trading Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former pro football player turned
stockbroker has been barred from the financial industry for at
least two years because of his involvement in the Paul Thayer
insider trading scandal of the early 1980s.
   An administrative law judge ruled in favor of the Securities and
Exchange Commission against William H. Mathis, barring the account
executive with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in Atlanta, Ga., from any
dealings with SEC-registered brokerages for at least two years.
   Mathis, a former National Football League running back who
captained the New York Jets team that won the 1969 Super Bowl, can
reapply for SEC approval to return to the business after two years,
as long as it is in a non-supervisory position, Administrative Law
Judge Brenda P. Murray said in a 27-page decision.
   In 1988 Mathis settled SEC civil charges without admitting or
denying wrongdoing. Murray's decision came in an SEC administrative
action.
   Mathis was not at the Bear Stearns office in Atlanta when called
for comment. His lawyers in Washington also were out of the office
Wednesday.
   But one of them, Mahlon M. Frankhauser, issued a statement
through his office which said in part: ``While Mr. Mathis believes
two years' suspension from the business to be absolutely
unjustified in light of the fact that he did not violate the
securities laws.'' Frankhauser said Mathis probably won't appeal
the decision.
   Mathis was among a wide circle of people who bought shares in
potential takeover targets between 1981 and 1983 with inside
information supplied by former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Thayer
and a close friend, Dallas stockbroker Billy Bob Harris.
   Both Thayer and Harris pleaded guilty in 1985 to obstructing
justice. They were sentenced to prison and ordered to pay a total
of $1 million in penalties and restitution.
   Thayer was deputy defense secretary in the Reagan administration
for a year beginning in January 1983.
   Prosecutors said that Thayer, while chairman of the board and
chief executive officer of the LTV Corp. and a board member of two
other companies, gave confidential corporate takeover information
to Harris, who in turn, bought stock for himself and friends and
passed the information on to other associates, including _
allegedly _ Mathis.
   Mathis was accused of tipping others about LTV's tender offer
for Grumman Corp.; Anheuser-Busch's tender offer for Campbell
Taggert Inc. and Allied Corp.'s tender offer for Bendix Corp.
   The SEC claimed he knew, or should have known, the information
was confidential.
   Mathis' lawyers had argued before Murray that the SEC shouldn't
be able to suspend him for violating securities laws simply because
he settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing.

<HEAD>UAL Board Extends Deadline to Obtain Financing in Buyout Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Employees of United Airlines have an additional
two months to find financing for their $4.38 billion buyout
attempt, but any thought of coming in with a lower offer is
probably out.
   Directors of the parent UAL Corp. met into the evening Wednesday
before agreeing to extend today's deadline to Oct. 9.
   They said the company's financial advisors would continue
negotiations with the employee group, but any restructured offer
must retain the shareholder value contemplated in the $201-a-share
bid made in April.
   ``Get the $200 any way you want, but get the $200,'' commented
airlines analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New
York.
   United Employee Acquisition Corp., the company formed to buy
UAL, told the directors that the Middle East crisis ``had slowed
the progress of its discussions with financing sources.''
   But Buttrick noted that while the economic turmoil engendered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait no doubt exacerbated the search for
financing, the buyout group was having problems long before the
recent events in the Middle East.
   ``It's obviously been a long and difficult road for the
acquisition group to find adequate equity financing,'' he said.
   The UAL board of directors told the employee group that if it
fails to find backing by the Oct. 9 deadline, the deal is off.
   And, the board said, ``In light of the events in the Middle
East, state of the financial markets and softening economy, there
can be no assurance that a transaction can be completed.''
   A man who answered the telephone at the buyout group's office
Wednesday evening said there would be no immediate comment on the
board's actions.
   Before the company revealed the extension, UAL stock recovered
some ground it had lost in trading during the last couple of weeks.
   Analysts said the rally Wednesday in UAL's stock after a plunge
of 38 percent in less than two weeks stemmed mainly from a sharp
drop in oil prices.
   UAL's stock rose $13.50 to $114.50 a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange. In the prior seven business days, the stock
tumbled from $163 to $101 amid doubts that the buyout would ever be
accomplished.
   Much of the skepticism was prompted by the withdrawal of three
large New York banks _ Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical Banking
Corp. and Citicorp _ from a five-bank group that had begun loan
talks with the buyout group.
   The two remaining banks, Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., have been joined by Security Pacific
Corp. of Los Angeles, said Penny Maines, a spokeswoman for the
California bank.

   By now, Jim Wells is used to the
laughs evoked by his product _ cow boots.
   But he says the number of dairy farmers who find it the perfect
answer to serious hoof problems is increasing.
   ``That's everybody's first reaction. It's comical to see a cow
wearing a boot,'' said Wells.
   ``They come over, make a joke about it, then ask what the boot
is for. Then I've got them.''
   Wells is attending New York's Empire Farm Days in Seneca Falls
to find buyers and distributors in the United States for his
``Shoes for Moos.'' Since introducing the boot last August, Wells
has sold more than 15,000 at $50 apiece in eight countries,
including Canada, the Soviet Union and Japan.
   ``The response has been unbelievable,'' said Wells, a part-time
marketing instructor at Conestoga College in Elmira, Ontario, and
the owner of a clothing store.
   Paul Larkin, a dairy farmer from Hamilton, N.Y., grinned as he
looked over Well's boot recently at the New York farm trade show.
He walked away with one under his arm.
   ``It's bad news when you have a cow with hoof rot or some other
kind of foot infection. I'm always looking for the better way and
this looked like one,'' Larkin said.
   The boot _ which looks like a shorter version of a firefighter's
boot _ is made of black, fabric-backed rubber with two bright
yellow straps and buckles to hold it in place. It has a textured
pebble bottom for traction on slippery surfaces.
   It's designed to protect the injured hoofs of cows while they
heal. Normally, when a cow develops hoof rot, corns, ulcers or
other foot infections, the cow is given antibiotics and the foot is
bandaged and wrapped with plastic bags to keep the dressing dry.
   ``Plastic bags, as you can imagine, aren't the best fit. Cows
will rub them, chew at them or whatever until they come off,'' said
Wells. ``They can't do that with the boot.''
   Another benefit is that boot-clad hooves don't need to be
treated with antibiotics. That saves the farmer milk, which must be
thrown away while a cow is on antibiotics, and the cost of
prescriptions, which can cost as much as $170, Wells said.
   ``It's a smart idea,'' said Everette Bridgeman, a dairy farm
worker from Bergen, N.Y.
   ``We've used old rubbers but they don't last long. I've heard of
other farmers using disposable diapers. Something that's durable
and works is what farmers are looking for,'' said Bridgeman.
   Customers with problems like Bridgeman's gave Wells the idea for
his reusable cow boot.
   ``Three years ago, I didn't know a thing about cows. But a
couple of Mennonite farmers came into my store and bought rubber
boots for their cows. After talking to them, I realized there was
untapped niche there,'' he said.
   There are 2{ million dairy cows in Canada and 11 million in the
United States. Capturing just 1 percent of those markets would mean
sales of $6.5 million.
   To discover what a cow looks for in comfortable footwear, Wells
turned to his brother-in-law, Tom Byers, a classifier with the
Holstein Association of Canada.
   Together, they designed and tested the prototype and convinced
amused officials at Kaufman Footwear in Kitchener, Ontario, to
manufacture it.
   ``We honestly thought this was just going to be a fad item,''
said Wells, who has been traveling full time in recent months to
promote his product at dairy shows throughout North America.

<HEAD>Deja Vu: Americans Asked to Save Energy and Drive Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shades of the Seventies. Americans are being
asked to cut down their power consumption and park their gas
guzzlers because a Middle East conflict has crimped the flow of
Arab oil.
   No, there aren't any long queues at gas stations or odd-even
rationing based on license plate numbers. And no one's been ordered
to adjust the thermostat to a set level.
   But car clubs and utilities have endorsed President Bush's
appeal to conserve energy after cutting off Iraq imports since its
takeover of Kuwait.
   ``Motorists understand action needs to be taken to guarantee
access to gasoline supplies, not only for their cars but for theirs
jobs and employment,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, spokesman for the
American Automobile Association.
   In a leter to the White House sent Wednesday, the AAA supported
the president's Persian Gulf actions. It also re-instituted its gas
watchers program, a collection of tips on cutting gas consumption
first issued in the 1970s during the Arab oil embargo.
   AAA, which has 32 million members, said the average price of
self-serve unleaded gasoline was $1.24 cents on Wednesday, an
increase of almost four cents from the day before and a jump of
16.2 cents a gallon in a week.
   Even car-crazed California, which has an abiding love affair
with the automobile, is preaching savings.
   ``Try to make five gallons do the work of six,'' said Tom Rohrer
of the California Automobile Association.
   None of the conservation would be needed if Americans weren't so
hooked on foreign oil. Half the country's oil _ about 8.4 million
barrels a day _ is imported.
   The dependence was first underscored with Arab oil embargoes in
1973 and 1979. It has now hit home again.
   ``Americans everywhere must do their part,'' Bush said in a
nationally televised speech that appealed for conservation.
   There were more calls and visitors than normal Wednesday at the
energy conservation center set up in 1979 by Consolidated Edison
Co. of New York. The office helps consumers chose the most
efficient appliances and touts energy-saving flourescent light
bulbs.
   ``You don't have to change your lifestyle, but you do have to
live smarter,'' said Harold McShane of Con Ed. ``Conservation is
important. We shouldn't just wait for a crisis to do something
about it.''
   The utility's 2.8 million customers face higher bills because
the company's oil costs have jumped $5 a barrel in a week. About 30
to 40 percent of its electricity comes from burning oil.
   ``We've been urging conservation all along,'' said utility
spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. ``People can help cut their costs if
they use energy wisely and don't waste.''
   One consumer who visited the center said she wouldn't mind
cutting back because of Iraq.
   ``I'm willing to sacrifice. Why should we use their oil?'' said
Madi Argueta, 30, of Guttenberg, N.J.
   Conservation was also the word in Sacramento, Calif., despite
temperatures above 100 for the second straight day.
   ``There's not a shortage today, just a fear of a shortage,''
said David Freeman, general manager of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District. ``This latest Middle East conflict is a wake up
call to America. We dare not fall asleep again.''
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, which promotes
the use of nuclear power, said about 5 percent of the nation's
energy comes from oil, down from about 17 percent in 1973.
   But dependence on oil has grown nearly 40 percent in the past
three years to 730,000 barrels of oil per day for electricity.
   ``We are far too dependent on foreign oil. It's a message we've
been carrying for a long time,'' said USCEA spokesman Scott Peters.
``We definitely need a strong energy strategy at the national level
to prevent this kind of thing from happening.''
   Nuclear power accounts for about 19 percent of the nation's
electricity.

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNK, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wouldn't have to travel
far from his Maine retreat this weekend to get an earful about
soaring gasoline prices. Talk about price-gouging and big oil's
greed surrounded the pumps at the Port Mobil filling station just
down the road from the First Family's seaside hideaway.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait a week ago, prices have jumped 20
cents a gallon, angering summer vacationers and townspeople in this
bustling tourist haunt midway between Portland and the New
Hampshire line.
   Craig Fraser, an attendant at Port Mobil, said some motorists
aren't swayed when he tells them the station is merely passing on
increases imposed by suppliers and isn't making any more money.
   ``You try to explain it to them and they get really frustrated
with you. They get real ugly,'' Fraser said.
   At Port Mobil and at the high-volume Gulf stations along the
Maine Turnpike, where prices were a few pennies lower, motorists
had no difficulty seizing on a villain.
   Some accused local dealers of price-gouging, but most pinned the
blame on the big oil companies.
   ``The oil companies have taken advantage of a perceived panic to
raise the price,'' said Gary Greene of Simsbury, Conn. ``The
dealers are just passing it along.''
   ``I don't fault the dealer,'' agreed Gordon Feldman of
Baltimore. He accused the big oil companies of profiteering as they
had during previous periods of international tension that raised
prices.
   Others questioned why prices were going up so rapidly and
maintained that there is no reason to charge more for gasoline
already in stock or in the pipeline.
   ``I think the dealers are jumping the gun,'' said Jean Cornwell
of Kennebunk Beach. ``I don't see any need for prices to go up
now.''
   William Franklin of Baltimore, driving his family of five home
from picturesque Bar Harbor in a van with a camper that gets 11
miles per gallon, reserved his wrath for Iraq.
   ``It upsets me,'' he said. ``We helped Iraq once, and this is
the thanks we get.''
   Port Mobil, less than two miles from the president's home in
Kennebunkport, is frequented by the Secret Service agents and other
members of the White House staff. Owner E.R. Warren Co. Inc., an
oil distributor as well as a retailer, has supplied te fuel that
powers the president's limousine and his speedboat as well as the
diesel-powered generators at the Bush compound.
   While tourism appears to be down from last year in much of
Maine, Kennebunk's Lower Village and Kennebunkport's Dock Square
have swarmed with vacationers this summer, sampling boutiques,
restaurants and art galleries made famous by their proximity to the
Bush family's summer home.
   Tourists account for roughly half the business at Port Mobil, a
two-pump station overlooking the river that separates the two
towns, but manager Michael Taylor said most complaints about gas
prices come from Maine natives. Tourists seem less inclined to
quibble, he said.
   ``They're here on vacation, and if it's $2 a gallon they're
going to fill it up,'' Taylor said. ``I'm the same way when I'm on
vacation.''
   By Wednesday, Port Mobil was charging $1.359 for regular
unleaded and $1.459 and $1.559 for the higher-octane blends, an
eight cent increase that day alone.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Bush Should Tap Oil Reserves to Keep Prices Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil industry analysts blame President Bush's
reluctance to tap the nation's emergency oil stockpile after the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis for much of the 15 cents more a gallon many
Americans are now paying for gasoline.
   ``There's a real question why we should put the economy and
consumers through all this pain when we have the oil available,''
said Adam Sieminski, an oil economist for Washington Analysis Corp.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week and other nations agreed not
to buy the 4.2 million barrels they had been exporting daily, oil
prices have skyrocketing faster than any time since World War II,
including the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
   The United States built a 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum
Reserve for just such a rainy day _ at a cost of $20 billion to
taxpayers over the past decade. Japan and most European countries
also have built similar stockpiles totaling 425 million barrels.
   Because there are countries that can still increase oil
production _ chiefly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela _ administration officials maintain there is no oil
shortage and no need to tap the reserve to drive down prices.
   ``There's an overhead of oil in the marketplace, thank God,''
Bush told a news conference Wednesday. ``I hope that this rapid
spike in oil prices will not be permanent. ... If the world begins
to see assurances that there will not be a dramatic cutdown on oil,
then things will return much more to normal in the market.''
   At a conference in Washington on Wednesday, Mexican Foreign
Secretary Fernando Solana, announced that his country would send an
additional 100,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States to
help fill the 700,000-barrel-a-day gap caused by the embargo of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The Mexican commitment is scheduled to last
two months.
   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there is ``evidence on the ground'' that Saudi Arabia is
moving to increase its oil production along with the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.
   ``But there's been no official acknowledgement of it; they're
keeping quiet,'' he said. ``We'll be pushing everybody who has any
additional capacity to start using it.''
   Amid those reports, prices of Brent Blent and West Texas
intermediate crude fell between $1.50 and $1.90 a barrel on the
London and New York markets Wednesday from $27.40-$28.30 a day
earlier. The prices averaged $19.40 in July.
   Analysts said it would take up to a month to get all that
incremental oil flowing, particularly from the Saudis.
   The Energy Department says it can have oil flowing from the U.S.
strategic reserve 16 days after a presidential decision to use it.
Sieminski and other analysts estimate that it would more likely
take a month.
   Once oil is flowing, the Energy Department can pump up to 3.5
million barrels from the U.S. reserve, which is stored in salt
caverns along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
   It would only take a fraction of that _ 500,000 barrels a day _
coupled with similar coordinated releases from the other world
stockpiles to douse fears of shortages and the resulting
speculation and hoarding, analysts said.
   ``If you're going to let the market handle this, you're looking
at a $15 increase and prices between $30 and $35 and spikes well
above that in September and October,'' Sieminski said.
   At those prices, he said, the use of oil throughout the world
would drop by a million barrels, but it would take six months to
accomplish it, risking a worldwide recession in the process.
   ``If September is going to be a problem, and it looks like it
is, the time to make a ... decision (to tap the reserve) is now,''
he said.
   U.S., Japanese and European officials in charge of the
government stockpiles scheduled a meeting today at the
International Energy Agency in Paris to coordinate possible use of
their government reserves.
   ``We will draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ in
cooperation with our allies _ if the severity of the situation
warrants it,'' said John Easton, a member of the U.S. delegation.
```Presently _ I emphasize presently _ there is not a significant
shortfall of crude oil in the market.''
   Philip Verleger, an oil analyst for the Institute for
International Economics, argued that immediately after the invasion
of Kuwait last Thursday, Bush should have announced releases of oil
from the reserve and closed trading in oil on the futures market
for a day.
   ``Doing nothing fanned the flames and drove prices up ... a
tragic mistake that has cost the consumers billions of dollars,''
he said.

<HEAD>Sears Announces Management Realignment in Merchandise Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chairman Edward A. Brennan of Sears, Roebuck and
Co. apparently figures if he wants it done right, he better do it
himself.
   Operating on this theory, Brennan replaced the head of the
company's retail division and took on the added responsibilities
himself.
   He said the flagging retail operation has to ``move faster''
than it had under Michael Bozic. Bozic was moved Wednesday from
chairman and chief executive officer to president and chief
operation officer for the division.
   There will be no change in Sears' ``everyday low pricing''
merchandising strategy, Brennan said in a statement. The strategy
began 17 months ago as the company struggled to reverse a decline
in profits.
   ``While we have complete confidence in our strategy, we need to
move faster and step up its implementation,'' Brennan said.
   The Merchandise Group's operating income in the last quarter
plunged 32 percent, to $110 million from $161.6 million.
   Retail revenues rose 2.2 percent to $7.9 billion from $7.7
billion, but the group continued to underperform discount
competitors such as K mart and Wal-Mart.
   Analysts said the realignment will give Brennan more control of
the retailing division and more responsibility for its success or
failure.
   ``It certainly signifies the importance of turning around the
retail group,'' said Richard Nelson, a retailing analyst with Duff
and Phelps Inc., in Chicago.
   Brennan started his Sears career in retailing and served as the
division's top officer for four years before ascending to the
corporate presidency in August 1984.
   Leo J. Shapiro, chief executive officer of Leo J. Shapiro and
Associates Inc., a Chicago-based retail research firm, said Brennan
faces an enormous task.
   ``I can see what Sears sees in him, but given his success I
don't see why he wants the job,'' Shapiro said.
   ``He has to make Sears live up to its promise, to be a vital
growing part of retail industry,'' he said. ``Right now, it's not.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices were higher at midday Thursday,
helped by a strong performance on Wall Street Wednesday and an
advance in the stock index futures market.
   A Wall Street rally a day earlier, which drove the Dow Jones
industrial average up 24.26 points to 2,734.90, buoyed sentiment in
London during the morning, traders said.
   A rally in the September Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index futures contract also spurred buying in the stock
market.
   Dealers said trading was light with the turbulence of the Middle
East keeping both institutional and private investors away from the
market.
   Oil stocks, the only sector to benefit from the potential
shortage in world oil, were hampered by profit-taking and a drop in
spot crude oil prices, dealers said.
   At 1 p.m. in London, the FT-SE 100-share index was up 11.5
points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,249.0.
   Volume came to 203.6 million shares at midday, compared with
258.6 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>Reports Rise in Fourth-Quarter Profit</HEAD>

   Sara Lee Corp. said Thursday its profit rose 15.3
percent in its fourth fiscal quarter, despite a decline in revenue
and lower results from its packaged meats and bakery products
businesses.
   The packaged food and consumer products company said it earned
$118.4 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months ended
June 30 compared with $102.7 million, or 43 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter slipped 3.3 percent to $2.95 billion
from $3.06 billion a year earlier.
   ``Higher margins in our coffee and grocery operations combined
with a continued strong profit ... in our personal products
businesses more than offset lower earnings in our packaged meats
and bakery line of business,'' chairman John Bryan said in a news
release.
   The company said total bakery volume fell 3 percent. Packaged
meat volume increased 5 percent but profits were down because of
higher hog costs, the company said.
   For the fiscal year, the company reported its profit rose 14.6
percent to $470.3 million, or $1.91 a share, from $410.5 million,
or $1.75 per share, in fiscal 1989.
   Net sales for the fiscal year fell 1 percent to $11.61 billion
from $11.72 billion in fiscal 1989.

   Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it will
offer four-year loans at 4.8 percent on selected car lines and
$1,000 cash rebates on others.
   The low-financing rate and rebate program runs through Sept. 26,
the official introduction of Ford's 1991 models. The 1991 Escort
and the Ford Explorer already are in showrooms and are exempt from
the incentive program.
   Ford will offer the 48-month financing at 4.8 percent through
Ford Motor Credit. Vehicles eligible for the rate are the Ford
Taurus and Thunderbird and the Lincoln Mercury-built Sable and
Cougar. Most other 48-month interest rates through Ford Credit are
7.9 percent.
   Cash rebates on Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles range from
$600 on the Aerostar minivan to $2,000 on the Lincoln Mark VII.

   Stock prices were modestly higher in quiet early
trading today as investors assumed a wait-and-see attitude while
events in the Persian Gulf unfold further.
   The market has a more secure foundation following the solid
gains posted Wednesday. As oil prices declined, Wall Street ended a
string of losses in the previous session when bargain-hunters
stepped in and picked up marked-down issues.
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks was up 2.48 points at 2,737.38.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchangewith 504 issues up, 428 issues down and 531 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Boardtotaled 20.6 million shares
as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.21 at 185.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index advanced 0.27 at 340.30.
   While traders believe the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia will deter further aggressive moves by Iraq, the fact that
Iraq is unwilling to leave Kuwait after last week's invasion
continues to cloak the market in a veil of uncertainty.
   ``Everyone is sitting around watchfully waiting,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, second vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. She predicted little movement in either direction.
   ``With a weekend coming, I don't think anyone is going to step
out and try to be a hero by buying the market,'' Zagorski said.
   Among actively traded issues, Wal Mart was up { at 30}; Pan Am
was unchanged at 2&lsqb;, and Philip Morris was up { at 46&lsqb;. Among
energy issues, which were hard hit Wednesday, Texaco was off &lsqb; at
62| and Exxon was down &rsqb; at 51&rsqb;.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average snapped a string
of six straight losing sessions and advanced 24.26 to 2,734.90.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by better than 5 to
3 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,015 up, 601
down and 406 unchanged.
   Trading activity slowed from the brisk pace of recent days.
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 190.40 million shares,
down from 231.58 million in the previous session.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 1.95 to 185.40.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at
340.03, up 0.19.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Turmoil May Fuel Drive for Better Auto Efficiency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait should build support
in Congress for requiring major improvements in automobile fuel
efficiency, environmentalists and consumer advocates say.
   ``Our troops in the Middle East may have to pay the ultimate
sacrifice,'' Bill Magavern of the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group said Wednesday. ``Encouraging conservation through greater
fuel economy is relatively painless.''
   Legislation is pending in Congress to require 40
miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency by the end of the decade, up from
the current standard of 27.5 mpg.
   Automakers, who fiercely oppose the bill, acknowledge the Middle
East crisis could make their lobbying more difficult.
   ``We're afraid it's going to be harder to fight,'' said Charles
Lockwood, general counsel of the Association of International
Automobile Manufacturers. ``We fear the Senate may take action
without considering all the consequences.''
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., cleared the
Senate Commerce Committee on a 14-4 vote April 3. Floor debate is
expected next month.
   ``We have been reminded that we squandered the breathing space
of the 1980s _ not using that period of low prices constructively
to lessen our dependence on foreign oil,'' Bryan said.
   More than 50 senators support the bill and Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and its aftermath may provide the 60 votes needed to halt a
filibuster, Magavern said.
   Under current law, new car fleets _ all the cars a company
manufactures in a model year _ are required to average at least
27.5 miles per gallon. The Bryan bill would require each company to
boost its average 20 percent by the 1995 model year and 40 percent
by 2001.
   The typical fleet would average 34.4 mpg in 1995 and 40.2 mpg by
2001.
   Supporters say higher mileage standards are needed to force the
auto industry to make more fuel-efficient cars. In addition to
saving oil, improved efficiency would reduce air pollution, they
say.
   Automakers say the bill's targets are technologically
unrealistic and would require drastic reductions in automobile
weight. All but the smallest cars would disappear from showrooms,
they warn, and many consumers would hold onto their old gas
guzzlers rather than crowd the family into a subcompact.
   ``It's an attempt to legislate the family car out of
existence,'' General Motors Corp. spokesman Bill Noack said.
   When the first gasoline shortages hit in the 1970s, domestic
auto companies had no fuel-efficient cars to sell, Ford Motor Co.
Vice President Helen Petrauskas said.
   Now, however, ``we have numerous small and mid-size, highly
fuel-efficient cars and trucks available,'' she said. ``We could
adjust production volumes to accommodate greater consumer demand.''
   Automakers will watch closely to see whether the latest oil
scare rekindles interest in smaller cars, Chrysler Corp. spokesman
Richard Muller said. If so, manufacturers will meet the demand _
but even then the Bryan standards would not be feasible, he said.
   Sales trends have been toward larger cars for the past eight
years, Muller said. ``This is the age of cheap gasoline,'' he said.
``It's still priced very reasonably compared to other countries.''
Adjusted for inflation, he said, gasoline actually sells for less
than during the early 1970s.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner notified Congress in
March that the Bush administration opposed the bill. A spokesman
said developments in the Middle East had not altered that position.

   If the Mideast crisis moves
consumers toward more fuel-efficient cars, General Motors Corp.
says it quickly can increase production of four-cylinder engines.
   ``We've got plenty of (engine-making) capacity if there is a
market shift. We would be able to handle it literally overnight,''
GM President Lloyd Reuss said Wednesday during a management
conference organized by the University of Michigan.
   Questions about fuel-efficient cars are cropping up more and
more as gasoline prices rise stemming from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   But one of the company's largest dealers says fuel efficiency
isn't high on consumer's preference lists.
   Joseph Celozzi, new car sales manager at Celozzi-Ettleson
Chevrolet-Geo in Chicago, said GM shouldn't worry about making lots
of four-cylinder cars.
   ``You try to sell a four-cylinder car and you aren't going
anywhere,'' he said. ``Very seldom will I sell a car with a
four-cylinder. I don't even stock a four-cylinder for a midsize.''
   The auto industry still is assessing potential effects from
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent rise of gasoline
prices. Typically, as gas prices increase, the balance between
sales of large and small cars tips in favor of smaller vehicles
with better fuel efficiency.
   Chrysler Corp., which has the best fuel-economy rating of the
Big Three, gave up the subcompact market when it stopped making its
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts in February.
   Ford Motor Co. is the only one of the Big Three that makes a
subcompact in the United States. But sales of its Escort have
slipped to the point that the company is offering incentives on its
new 1991 models.
   Many of GM's most fuel-efficient cars are tied up in its
four-vehicle Geo line. Two of the cars are imported directly from
Japan and two others are made at joint ventures in California and
Canada.
   As an alternative to making subcompacts, Reuss said GM is ready
to increase production of its four-cylinder engines for larger cars.
   There's a risk for automakers in increasing the percentage of
small cars they sell at the expense of large-car sales _ they
aren't nearly as profitable as larger cars.
   The Big Three were burned during the oil and gasoline supply
crisis in the early 1970s, and Japanese companies got their feet in
the door of the U.S. market with small, fuel-efficient cars.
   The U.S. auto industry has changed since then. Engine technology
during the 1980s improved horsepower and fuel efficiency at the
same time. Also, efficiency of exhaust emission systems has
improved, resulting in better overall fuel economy.
   The Big Three carefully are monitoring consumer attitudes,
mainly through their dealers.
   Business at River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in Houston has been
slow during the last few days, General Manager Alan Helfman said,
possibly because of the Mideast events.
   ``Sales of big cars are going down,'' Helfman said. ``I had a
sales increase just before this happened, and in the last few days,
it's gotten quiet.''

   Stock prices were marginally higher in quiet
early trading today as investors focused on narrow segments of the
market and assumed a wait-and-see attitude while events in the
Persian Gulf unfold further.
   Dealers said much of the trading activity was occurring in
retail and energy issues. The nation's major stores are reporting
mixed July sales today, and oil stocks continue to attract
attention as U.S. forces take up defensive positions in Saudi
Arabia to protect the world's largest oil producer.
   In addition, there is some nervousness surrounding the
Treasury's planned sale this afternoon of $10.25 billion in 30-year
bonds. The auction comes on the heels of a disappointing response
to Wednesday's sale of 10-year notes.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 3.47 points
at 2,738.37 at midmorning.

   Six to eight General Motors Corp. assembly
plants may have to close or cut production because of a strike by
2,800 workers at a parts plant, the automaker says.
   The walkout Wednesday at GM's AC Rochester Division Flint West
plant came after negotiations with the United Auto Workers union on
employee grievances about health and safety issues broke off
Wednesday morning.
   ``We're obviously disappointed,'' said GM President Lloyd Reuss,
reached at a meeting at Traverse City. He estimated the walkout
could force production cuts or shutdowns at six to eight assembly
plants.
   ``I would expect the assembly plants to be impacted in the next
two to three days,'' Reuss said, declining to identify the plants.
   With a typical assembly plant employing 5,000 people or more,
the numbers of employees affected could be in the tens of
thousands, GM spokesman John Maciarz said.
   The strike will affect assembly operations more quickly because
of the automaker's adoption of the just-in-time parts inventory
system.
   The just-in-time system involves manufacturing gas tanks, van
doors and grilles, pickup truck grilles and other parts, and
shipping them as they are needed, rather than keeping costly
inventories in storage. ``There are no big warehouses out in back
any more,'' Maciarz said.
   ``Certainly a large number of our assembly operations would be
impacted, and other supplier divisions would be impacted because of
not being able to send parts to assembly plants,'' he said. ``By
Monday, anyway, we would begin to see an impact.''
   Maciarz said GM negotiators were ready to continue talks with
the union, but he didn't know when they might resume.
   ``Hopefully, it won't be a long strike,'' said Duane
Zuckschwerdt, a UAW bargainer.
   Because the impact would spread rapidly to other plants and
other employees, the local is under pressure not only from GM but
from other UAW locals, said David Cole, director of the Office for
the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of
Michigan.
   If a strike is a local matter and not part of a national UAW
plan, he said, ``Both GM and the UAW are going to find a way to
eliminate them from the game.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in
quiet, cautious trading in advance of this afternoon's Agriculture
Department crop report.
   Wheat futures were moderately higher, extending Wednesday's
gains. Corn was fractionally lower and soybeans were up slightly.
   The USDA report was due out after the close and was to contain
the first government estimates of 1990 U.S. corn and soybean
production based on field surveys.
   A survey of grain analysts yielded corn production estimates
ranging from 7.7 billion to 8.2 billion bushels compared with last
year's 7.5 billion.
   Analysts estimate 1990 U.S. soybean production at 1.8 billion to
1.9 billion bushels versus last year's 1.9 billion.
   The USDA also is expected to revise upward its projection for
the U.S. corn stockpile as of Aug. 31, 1991, due to an expected
decline in Soviet grain imports during the crop year that begins
Sept. 1.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 3\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.87} a bushel;
corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with September at $2.51\ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with September at $1.17{ a
bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3\ cents higher with August at
$5.94{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after Wednesday's advance; pork futures were
lower, extending Wedneday's steep losses.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August
at 78.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .30
cent higher with August at 89.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent to .52 cent lower with August at 56.20 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.15 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2
cents lower with August at 48.50 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Artist's Estate Reaches Settlement With Magazine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Playboy can only sell two of four posters based
on drawings Keith Haring had done for the magazine, and it must
tell buyers they were not authorized by the late pop artist,
according to an out-of-court settlement.
   The settlement was announced Wednesday.
   Haring's estate filed suit in June in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan against Playboy Enterprises Inc., claiming copyright
infringement and deceptive trade practices.
   The posters were being sold along with ``certificates of
authenticity'' for up to $600, said Peter Stern, attorney for the
Keith Haring Foundation. The posters are worth only about $5, he
said.
   The estate also claimed that three of the four drawings had been
``colorized,'' at least one was altered and Haring's signature was
added to two of them.
   Under the settlement, Chicago-based Playboy agreed to recall and
cease marketing two of the posters, Stern said.
   The other two must bear a disclaimer stating: ``This (work) was
made without the participation of Keith Haring or his Estate.''
   Playboy also agreed not to issue ``certificates of
authenticity'' or to use the Haring trademark or logo.
   The settlement did not involve any payment of money by either
party, Playboy said in a news release.
   The Haring estate, Playboy said, agreed to stop selling and turn
over to Special Editions Ltd., its inventory of Haring-designed
T-shirts that was published in ``Playboy'' magazine in 1986.
Special Editions is a subsidiary of Playboy Enterprises.

<TEXT>
   The nation's big retailers today reported mixed July results as
seasonal weather and promotions to clear out summer merchandise
buoyed business at several major store chains.
   Last month marked a continuation of a gradual slowdown in
consumer spending, analysts said. With unemployment on the rise and
inflation expected to flare up due to the recent oil price surge,
retailers coulrlier's
$2.02 billion. But on a comparable store basis, sales grew a more
modest 2.2 percent.
   One of the standouts, as usual, was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which
posted a 21 percent increase in total July revenue to $2.4 billion
from $1.98 billion. Its same-store sales grew 8 percent in July.
The rapidly growing discounter is expected to challenge Sears and K
mart for the No.1 ranking in terms of nationwide revenue this year.
   Several specialty apparel retailers also outperformed the
industry. The Gap Inc., for instance, said its July sales jumped 36
percent to $114 million from $84 million last year. Sales at stores
open a year or longer rose 28 percent.
   Among other retailers reporting today were:
   _Department store operator J.C. Penney Co. said its July sales
rose 3.2 percent to $1.01 billion from $974 million a year earlier.
Same-store sales grew 2 percent.
   _Dayton Hudson Corp., which owns department stores and the big
Target discount chain, said its sales grew 16.4 percent to $984
million in July from $845 million a year earlier. Same-store sales
were up 4.4 percent.
   _May Department Stores Co. said its sales grew 9.8 percent to
$606.8 million from $552.7 million last year. Comparable store
sales rose 4.4 percent.
   _Woolworth Corp., owner of numerous specialty store chains, said
its domestic sales increased 8.7 percent to $389 million in July
from $358 million last year. Domestic same-store sales rose 4.9
percent.
   _Melville Corp., which operates off-price, drug and other
specialty stores, said its July sales rose 9.7 percent to $554.1
million from $505.2 million a year earlier. It didn't release
results on a same-store basis.
   _Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. said its sales grew 19
percent to $348.9 million in July from $292.5 million in 1989.
Same-store sales rose 6 percent.

   In addition, nervousness surrounds the Treasury's planned sale
this afternoon of $10.25 billion in 30-year bonds. The auction
comes on the heels of a disappointing response to Wednesday's sale
of 10-year notes.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 2.72
points at 2,732.18 at midday.
   Gainers were nearly matching losers on the New York Stock
Exchangewith 627 issues up, 663 issues down and 545 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Boardtotaled 71.94 million shares
at noon, compared with 93.78 million shares at the same time
Wednesday.
   While traders believe the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia will deter further aggressive moves by Iraq, the fact that
Iraq is unwilling to leave Kuwait after last week's invasion
continues to cloak the market in a veil of uncertainty.
   ``Everyone is sitting around watchfully waiting,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, second vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``With a weekend coming, I don't think anyone is going to step
out and try to be a hero by buying the market,'' Zagorski said.

   Salomon Inc., parent of the Wall Street house
Salomon Brothers, said Thursday it will scale down the commodities
trading operation of its Philipp Brothers unit.
   In a statement, Salomon attributed the move to ``prolonged
difficult market conditions and trading losses.''
   The operation that will be scaled back and repositioned within
the parent company trades nonferrous and precious metals,
agricultural products and other non-energy-related commodities,
said Salomon spokeswoman Macy Egerton.
   She said she could not provide information on whether the
downsizing would involve job losses or provide any other details.
   Salomon said in its statement that it was too early to say how
much the downsizing program would cost the company, but that it was
not expected to exceed $200 million before taxes.
   The downsizing does not involve the energy-related activities of
Salomon's Philbro Energy unit or the securities traded by Salomon
Brothers, the company said.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart's Quarterly Net Up 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Thursday
reported 25 percent growth in its second-quarter profit on a 25
percent sales gain.
   The fast-growing discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., earned
$272.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the three months ended July
31, up from $219 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales grew to $7.54 billion in the retailer's fiscal 1990 second
quarter from $6.05 billion a year before.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, credited the
company's merchandising strategy for producing the profit
improvement.
   ``Our customers continue to support our efforts to serve them
with quality merchandise and service,'' he said in a news release.
   But he said that forecasts for the second half of the year ``are
characterized by anticipated economic uncertainty.''
   Wal-Mart has bucked the slowing trend in the retail industry
this year and has consistently outperformed its competitors. The
discounter might pass Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart Corp. this
year in annual sales volume, industry analysts say. Sears and K
mart are the nation's first- and second-ranked retailers,
respectively.
   Also on Thursday, Wal-Mart reported its sales for July, which
exceeded the gains posted by most other major general merchandise
chains. Last month sales rose 21 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier. Sales at Wal-Mart-owned stores open a year
or longer rose 8 percent.
   For the first half of its year, Wal-Mart earned $526 million, or
46 cents a share, up 26 percent from $417 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales for the first half amounted to $14.31
billion, up 25 percent from $11.42 billion in 1989's first half.
   Wal-Mart opened two new distribution centers and completed a
third during the second quarter, resulting in an addition of
3,110,620 square feet of distribution space.
   In the quarter, 18 new Wal-Mart stores and four Sam's Wholesale
Clubs were opened. For the year, the company has opened 36 Wal-Mart
stores, nine Sam's and one Hypermart USA.
   Wal-Mart operates in 30 states.

<HEAD>VW Offers 30-Day Money Back Guarantee On Passat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling with weak sales, Volkswagen United
States Inc. is offering a 30-day money back guarantee on its
mid-size Passat automobiles.
   Anyone unsatisfied with a Passat car or station wagon in the
first 30 days or 3,000 miles of ownership may return it and get
their money back, Bill Young, vice president in charge of
Volkswagen United States, said Wednesday.
   Other automakers have offered or are offering similar
guarantees, although none allow a buyer to walk away with their
money.
   Oldsmobile, for example, is offering to let buyers of its 1990
models who are not satisfied after the first 30 days or 1,500 miles
of ownership return a car for credit toward the purchase of another
Oldsmobile.
   At VW, Gelgota said, ``You get the full refund, sales tax, title
and license fees and everything. It's your cash back.''
   VW doesn't think it is risking its money, Gelgota said. ``It's
based on our research. Ninety-seven percent of our customers are so
satisfied they would recommend the Passat to a friend or relative.''
   VW will purchase any returned cars from dealers, Gelgota said.

   The German automaker, which holds less than 2 percent of the
U.S. auto market, has been plagued with sluggish sales. The company
sold an average of 1,426 Passats a month through July, compared
with Volkswagen's ultimate goal of 3,000 a month.

   It's just after dawn as David Whitehead
maneuvers his boxy milk truck up the first driveway of the day. At
the house, he grabs two half-gallons as he jumps out, drops them
into the insulated box, then is off to his next stop.
   The thud of cartons has replaced the clatter of bottles. But
otherwise, this could be a scene from the 1940s, when nearly every
gallon of milk Americans drank at home was delivered to their
doorsteps.
   His reassuring presence may not be as pervasive as it was 50
years ago, but the milkman is definitely back, in Connecticut and
other parts of the country.
   And he's updated for the '90s with a product list that rivals
any small grocery store.
   ``With more women working, the convenience of having the product
delivered to the home is more appealing because they have better
things to do with their discretionary time,'' says Michael Marcus,
president of Marcus Dairy in Danbury, Conn.
   ``There are enough people out there who want the service,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of getting the word out.''
   Nostalgia is part of the appeal. Marcus said his customers are
clamoring to have their milk delivered in glass bottles, partly for
ecological reasons _ they're recyclable _ but also for the memories
they conjure up.
   His milk now comes in plastic-coated paper cartons, but he plans
to bring back bottles as soon as he can find a manufacturer.
   For the same reason, drivers for the Palm Beach Milk Co. in Palm
Beach, Fla., wear the traditional white uniform, black bow tie and
white hat. Marcus drivers wear gray uniforms, sans hat.
   ``The old axiom of the milkman being part of the family, we're
fostering that image,'' said Jacques von Spiro, who started Palm
Beach Milk three months ago to cater to a growing market.
   In Connecticut, 25 Marcus trucks fan out across the state six
days a week. The 110 stops on Whitehead's route include fancy
beachfront estates, modest homes in middle-class neighborhoods and
small homes in public housing projects.
   Orders run the gamut. One family gets a half-pint of cream
delivered twice a week. Another gets practically everything Marcus
Dairy offers: eight varieties of milk, orange and grapefruit juice,
cottage cheese, sour cream, eggs, ice cream, yogurt, butter, bacon
and plastic trash bags.
   Fat-free beef will soon be offered on some routes, and the dairy
is negotiating with an independent grocer to deliver all groceries,
Marcus said.
   ``If I could have all my groceries delivered, I would,'' said
Patricia Carrubba, a customer on Whitehead's route who has been
getting her milk and orange juice delivered for two years.
   Marcus charges $1.92 for a half-gallon of home-delivered milk,
compared to a dollar and change in some stores. That's enough of a
difference to make the milkman the ``first to go'' when a family
suffers a financial crunch, said Whitehead, a beefy, bearded
42-year-old who has been with Marcus Dairy for 21 years. Business
also slows down during the summer, he said.
   Michael Marcus, whose grandfather started the dairy in 1924,
says home milk delivery started to decline during the 1950s and
1960s with the rise of the two-car family.
   His deliveries dropped to their lowest point around 1978, but
started to rebound slowly about five years ago. Today, they account
for about 9 percent of his business, or about 7,500 accounts.
   Marcus, whose other customers include schools, hospital and
other institutions, projects growth of 1 percent a month and hopes
home deliveries will account for half his business within a couple
of years.
   Von Spiro said he researched the home delivery business for two
years before starting Palm Beach Milk in May with 208 customers.
   He now has more than 1,000 customers, and hopes to expand in
Florida and across the country.
   His company offers 98 products, including baked goods and smoked
salmon, delivered in pre-packaged, cooler-like boxes. The milk,
which comes in glass bottles, is $1.99 a half-gallon.
   Just 1 percent of the 3 billion gallons of milk produced
nationwide is delivered to the home, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. But dairymen like Marcus and von Spiro
see a growing if modest niche for the home-delivery business.
   ``With both husbands and wives working, there's not a lot of
time,'' von Spiro said. ``They appreciate this.''
   Von Spiro said his typical Palm Beach customers aren't
spectacularly wealthy, but working couples between the ages of 25
and 50, most without children.
   In addition to yuppies, Marcus's Connecticut drivers also serve
some lower-income families and elderly shut-ins who can't get to
the market.
   For some customers, like Vera Cole with a mansion on Long Island
Sound, delivery simply makes life easier.
   ``I find I spend less money on groceries because if I get milk
and orange juice from the milkman, I don't make as many trips to
the grocery store,'' she said.

<HEAD>Reports 66 Percent Rise in Fourth Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Thursday its
fourth-quarter profit climbed 66 percent from results a year ago
that were depressed by a big onetime charge.
   The consumer products giant said it earned $284 million, or 78
cents per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with
$171 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.
   P&amp;G said its quarterly earnings would have increased 14 percent,
excluding the effect of the $78 million, after-tax reserve
established in June 1989 to consolidate production facilities.
   Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter rose 14.4 percent to
$6.22 billion from $5.43 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, the company said its earnings rose 32.8 percent to
$1.6 billion, or $4.49 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $3.56 a
share, the previous year.
   Worldwide net sales rose 13 percent to $24.08 billion for the
year from $21.4 billion the previous year.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the earnings increase for the year was due
primarily to what Chairman Edwin L. Artzt called the biggest
worldwide unit volume increase the company has achieved in 32 years.
   P&amp;G also said a lower corporate income tax rate and the
manufacturing consolidation reserve fund contributed to the
earnings increase.
   The growth in earnings was greater than the increase in earnings
per share because of the November 1989 acquisition of Noxell Corp.,
a Maryland-based maker of skin care products, in exchange for P&amp;G
common stock.

   Delta Air Lines joined the list of airlines
boosting their fares because of recent increases in jet fuel,
announcing Thursday a 5.3 percent increase on all international and
domestic fares effective Aug. 15.
   The announcement follows by one day the announcement of a 10
percent hike by American Airlines. Pan American World Airways and
Northwest Airlines also have said they will raise fares to offset
higher fuel prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Whit Hawkins, Delta's senior vice president for marketing, said
that jet fuel costs have risen 10 cents a gallon since July 31. He
said that the fare hike reflects only the fuel price increase.
   Delta says the 10-cent a gallon increase in fuel represents $200
million a year in operating expenses.
   Michael W. Gunn, American Airline's senior vice president for
marketing, said the increase at American will go into effect Friday
for flights in the continental United States, Hawaii and the
Caribbean and on Aug. 15 for international flights.

<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange today elected Wall
Street veteran William H. Donaldson as chairman and chief executive
officer, replacing retiring head John J. Phelan Jr.
   The NYSE's board also expanded President Richard A. Grasso's
duties to executive vice chairman. Both appointments take effect
Jan. 1.
   ``I don't think we could get a finer selection than Bill
Donaldson,'' Phelan told a news conference. Donaldson, who first
came to Wall Street 35 years ago, called the appointment ``a
tremendous homecoming.''
   The announcements came after a special board meeting to select a
new leader for the nation's largest and the world's second largest
stock exchange.
   Donaldson, 59, founded Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. in 1959
with two college friends one year out of Harvard Business School.
He was tabbed by a nine-member search panel appointed after Phelan
in February announced plans to retire at the end of the year.
   Grasso's additional responsibilities were described by people
familiar with the selections as an inducement to keep him at the
exchange. It was widely known that he had wanted the chairman's job.
   Donaldson praised Phelan's administration for being ``responsive
to the unexpected,'' during such events as the market gyrations
that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.
   ``As we've seen from the last few days, new challenges come from
unexpected places,'' Donaldson said.
   He said some of the challenges facing the exchange in the 1990s
will be keeping up with technological changes affecting global
securities trading.
   ``New generations of technology will have to be deployed in
support of the soundest trading concepts,'' Donaldson said.
``Innovative financial products will have to be tested for their
acceptability in the marketplace as well as their technical
excellence.''
   Phelan, chairman since 1984, will remain a consultant for NYSE
relations with foreign stock exchanges. He currently is chairman of
the Association of International Stock Exchanges and has traveled
extensively during his tenure cultivating ties with markets abroad.
   Donaldson left DLJ in the early 1970s to serve as an
undersecretary of state to Henry Kissinger. He later founded Yale
University's School of Organization and Management before returning
to Wall Street in the early 1980s.
   He founded and still operates a money management and merchant
banking firm, Donaldson Enterprises Inc. in 1980.
   Donaldson is best known on Wall Street for leading and winning a
fight to overturn an NYSE ban on publicly owned securities firms.
After the exchange agreed to let DLJ sell stock to the public in
1969, many securities firms followed.
   Donaldson takes over one of the most high-profile jobs in the
securities industry at a time of increased competition from
overseas markets, rapidly developing technology and controversial
volatility that allegedly has undermined individual investors'
confidence in the stock market.
   Wall Street executives said Donaldson's strong ties in
Washington would help Wall Street in such fights as a Bush
administration plan to tax stock transactions.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators moved today to get $40.9
million in restitution from Charles H. Keating Jr. and five other
officers of a Phoenix holding company that owned the failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision also said it also wanted to
remove Keating and five other officers from American Continental
Corp., which owned the Irvine, Calif., thrift before its $2 billion
failure last year.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the federal agency, called the move
``the most significant enforcement action OTS has ever
undertaken.'' The restitution order is largest sought by federal
regulators.
   The administrative action against Keating and the other American
Continental officers seeks to recover $40.9 million in losses from
three business deals that one official said showed ``evidence of
blatant disregard for the safety and soundness of Lincoln.''
   If recovered, the money would be returned to Lincoln, which was
seized by federal regulators April 14, 1989.
   The restitution order applies to Keating and the five executives
and Ryan said the agency is seeking the money from all six, either
individually or as a group.
   Keating is already named in a $1.1 billion racketeering suit
filed by the Resolution Trust Corp. charging him with fraudulently
diverting depositors' money.
   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is conducting a criminal
investigation of Keating's financial dealings and sources say the
Justice Department is investigating whether he improperly donated
$1.3 million to five senators who intervened with regulators on his
behalf three years ago.
   OTS also issued an order demanding that Keating produce in five
days a detailed accounting of his own assets. Ryan said regulators
don't believe Keating's repeated claims since his company filed for
bankruptcy protection last year that he is broke.
   ``There was just too much money available to him and too short a
time for it to disappear,'' Ryan told reporters at a news
conference. ``We believe Mr. Keating and his associates profited
from the improper use of depositors' funds and we want that money
returned to Lincoln.''
   The order requires Keating to identify all foreign bank accounts
and assets and bars him from transferring any money overseas. It
also requires Keating to give OTS two days notice before he
transfers any money or assets worth more than $5,000, OTS said.
   The administrative action seeks to remove Keating and the top
executives of American Continental from office and to bar them
``from ever serving in position in any federally insured
institution,'' Ryan said.
   OTS also sought to remove Judy J. Wischer, president and chief
executive officer of American Continental; Robert J. Kielty, a
director, senior vice president and general counsel of the company;
Keating's son, Charles H. Keating III, an executive vice president
and director; and two of Keating's sons-in-law who are vice
presidents _ Robert J. Hubbard and Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr.
   The amount sought represents losses that regulators say Lincoln
suffered as a result of three business deals involving subsidiaries
of American Continental.
   The transactions detailed by regulators include the purchase by
an American Continental subsidiary of the Hotel Ponchartrain in
Detroit and its subsequent resale at an inflated price to a limited
partnership that included Keating and his associates.
   Regulators contend that Lincoln financed the hotel purchase
without sufficient underwriting and continued to pour money into
the losing Detroit hotel with a line of credit that exceeded its
market value.
   The OTS restitution order includes $4.4 million in losses from
purchase of 1,000 acres of desert land 20 miles from Phoenix and
its resale at inflated prices to Westcontinental Mortgage Corp.
Regulators contend the sales were intended to improperly boost
Lincoln's profits and allow American Continental to take tax
deductions.
   The order also seeks recovery of $12.3 million in losses that
regulators say Lincoln suffered from the misuse of an employee
stock ownership plan. The plan borrowed money by Lincoln to finance
the purchase of American Continental stock from Keating and others,
including the five other executives named in the order.
   Until today, the largest restitution action was a $24 million
suit filed earlier this year against Thomas Spiegel, former owner
of the failed Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   Spiegel is accused by regulators of squandering depositors'
money on vacations, wine, guns and business deals with junk bond
king Michael Milken.

<TEXT>
   BP America Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co. and
Conoco Inc. said today they were cutting their gasoline prices,
while Atlantic Richfield Co. announced a one-week price freeze.
   Other big oil companies promised to practice price restraint
amid public outcry over alleged price gouging and after President
Bush asked the industry to show restraint in the face of escalating
tensions in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
   The companies have denied allegations that they have been using
instability in the Gulf as an excuse to drive up prices at the gas
pumps. Unleaded gas has risen more than 16 cents a gallon since
Iraq invaded Kuwait last Thursday.
   The price cuts came as Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
sent telegrams to top executives of 11 oil companies on Wednesday
warning of possible legislation in response to recent gasoline
price increases. He urged the companies to delay any additional
price increases ``until clear and convincing justifications can be
presented.''
   ``I can assure you that it will be very difficult to stop
legislation controlling the prices of petroleum products or taxing
profits resulting from these increases should no action be taken by
the oil industry,'' Dole said.
   The telegrams were sent to chief executive officers of Amoco,
Mobil, Conoco, Exxon, Shell, Texaco, BP America, Unocal, Pennzoil,
Atlantic Richfield and Chevron.
   BP, the Cleveland-based subsidiary of British Petroleum and the
9th-largest oil company in the United States, said it was rolling
back prices at the gas pumps by 3 cents per gallon. The company
cited recent easing in prices in the pretroleum markets and Bush's
request for restraint.
   No. 11 Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said it was
cutting prices at some of its gasoline terminals by as much as 4.5
cents due to market changes.
   Conoco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilmington, Del.-based Du
Pont Co., said it lowered by 3 to 4 cents its wholesale prices for
gasoline and by a penny its price for diesel fuel.
   Kevin Lindemer, an energy analyst at Cambridge Research
Associaties in Cambridge, Mass., said the companies' actions were
``primarily to help consumers and wholesalers take the edge off,
maybe help head off some hoarding.''
   ``It takes some of the panic and fear out of the market,'' he
said. ``It helps prices take a bit of a breather.''
   Arco said Wednesday its freeze affects prices of gasoline,
diesel and jet fuel. Arco said it was encouraging its dealers, who
by federal law set their own pump prices, to avoid increases.
   The company said if crude oil prices continued to rise at the
end of the week it would be forced to raise prices. ``Otherwise, if
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the
marketplace,'' Arco said.
   Several oil companies said they backed Bush's call for
restraint, but defended price hikes on the grounds that crude oil
prices had increased much faster than gasoline prices in the last
month.
   ``Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, crude prices have
increased approximately 35 percent,'' Houston-based Shell Oil Co.
said in a statement today.
   The company promised to exercise restraint but it did not lower
prices, saying its increases had been about half of the national
average.
   The industry has come under assault in recent days from
politicians and consumer groups alleging price gouging. Some took
to the offensive against their critics.
   ``Unfortunately we are in an election year and there is a
temptation on the part of many of those in the political arena who,
in the desire for public exposure, thrash out one more time at the
oil industry,'' said Robert McClements, chairman and chief
executive of Philadelphia-based Sun Co.
   Exxon Corp. said it would continue pricing its products ``in a
responsible manner that reflects overall market supply
conditions.'' The world's largest oil company said it buys 2.7
million barrels of oil daily and ``must compete on world markets
and pay world market prices.''
   Oil companies have been criticized frequently since gas prices
soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a year
later following the Arab oil embargo. Prices climbed to 69 cents by
1978, before surging above $1 when Iranian supplies were cut off by
its 1979 revolution deposing the regime of U.S. ally the Shah.
   More recently, prices jumped after the Exxon Valdez spill off
the Alaska coast last year and heating oil skyrocketed during a
December freeze. Despite allegations, no profiteering or collusion
by companies was proven.
   Herbert Schmertz, a senior public relations official at Mobil
Corp. during the 1970s oil crises, said the companies should
criticize the government for increasing reliance on foreign oil by
balking at developing domestic sources.
   ``The finger should be pointed right back at the people who are
doing the screaming,'' he said. ``They caused this problem.''
   He said that in 1973, ``we treated those attacks as if they were
rational attacks and we responded in a rational way. You can't deal
with irrational attacks in a rational wars' funds.
   Concert audiences, theatergoers and visitors to museums and art
galleries are being recruited as foot soldiers in the arts
advocates' battle to protect the NEA from serious damage this fall
when Congress debates extending the life of the $171 million
federal arts agency.
   Congress, prompted by protests of NEA-financed projects, amended
this year's agency budget to ban federal support of ``depictions of
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   Supporters of restrictions say the issue is not censorship, as
many artists contend, but taxpayers' right to decide where their
money is spent.
   In a recent full-page ad in major newspapers, the Rev. Pat
Robertson asked members of Congress, ``Do you want to face the
voters in your district with the charge that you are wasting their
hard-earned money to promote sodomy, child pornography and attacks
on Jesus Christ?''
   On the other side, pamphlets labeled ``Be Quiet and the Arts
Will Just Go Away'' are being handed to theater patrons in Chicago,
courtesy of the Illinois Arts Alliance. Inside are cutout post
cards urging senators and House members to support the NEA, and
this warning:
   ``A small faction of politicians and extreme right-wingers want
to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, which provides
government support for artists and arts institutions in the United
States. This minority is well organized and vocal. Their side is
winning.''
   In Baltimore, patrons of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra concerts,
Center Stage plays and Maryland Art Place exhibition openings are
asked to write members of Congress, sign petitions and dial a
special 900 telephone number appealing for a five-year extension of
the NEA, without any anti-obscenity restrictions on the grants it
awards.
   ``It's now time for us to stand up,'' said Philip Arnoult,
director of the Theater Project in Baltimore.
   The League of American Theaters and Producers in New York
published a pro-NEA editorial in Playbills that have reached an
estimated 1 million theatergoers. The Metropolitan Arts Commission
in Portland, Ore., working with Mayor Bud Clark, won the
endorsement of the U.S. Conference of Mayors for a letter to
Congress urging no-strings support for the endowment.
   Besides the ``art ambulance'' and a multimedia ``Caravan for
Freedom of Expression'' van that has toured Boston neighborhoods,
arts supporters there have circulated a ``Declaration of Cultural
Rights'' that opposes what they view as threatened government
censorship of the arts.
   A full-page advertisement in the Boston Globe last month,
featuring a once-controversial John Singer Sargent portrait of a
woman with a plunging neckline, resulted in 1,000 calls urging
members of Congress to support the NEA, the ad's sponsors said.
   An estimated 5,000 patrons of San Francisco Bay Area bookstores
signed letters petitioning Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., to vote
against anti-obscenity curbs on the endowment. Rodin's ``The
Thinker'' was shrouded for an hour every day during a 12-day
``Festival for Freedom of Expression'' in San Francisco that was
backed by more than 200 arts organizations.
   Bob Lynch, director of the non-profit National Association of
Local Arts Agencies, said his organization's 900-number campaign
has yielded an estimated 100,000 mailgrams and perhaps a
half-million personal calls and letters to Capitol Hill in support
of the endowment.
   Although the NEA's conservative critics are heavily financed,
Lynch said, ``we will ultimately win because it is becoming clear
that Americans recognize the value of the arts and the endowment,
and are not people who respond blindly to the other side's appeals
to `stop sin'.''
   The House has agreed to begin debate on the arts endowment's
fate in September, when it will consider Republican-led proposals
to restrict the agency's grant-making authority, shift the bulk of
its grant money to state control or abolish the NEA altogether.
   ``Time is of the essence,'' said Anne Murphy, executive director
of the non-profit American Arts Alliance, a national arts advocacy
coalition. ``Every individual who calls, writes or meets personally
with a member of Congress really does help.''

   The Department of Trade and Industry on Thursday
cleared Cabdury Schweppes PLC's 125 million-pound ($34 million)
acquisition of Source Perrier's non-cola soft drinks business.
   The department also cleared the planned merger of the home

   The Perrier purchase, announced in May, includes two plants in
the Paris area and another in Marseilles for various brands of
Perrier subsidiary Compagnie d'Exploitation de Boissons
Refraichissantes, including Oasis, Atoll, and Gini.
   Under a deal announced in June, Boots and W.H. Smith will each
hold 50 percent of a home improvements joint venture, which is
expected to operate under the trade name of W.H. Smith's ``Do It
All'' chain.
   The combination of ``Do It All'' and Boots' ``Payless'' chain

   The U.S. dollar edged lower today against major
foreign currencies in quiet trading in Europe. Gold prices were
higher.
   Herwig Priellip, chief trader at Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in
Frankfurt, said trading reflected ``a total lack of interest'' in
currency dealings for the moment.
   Dealers said the dollar has some underlying support as tensions
remain high about developments in the Persian Gulf where Iraq
invaded Kuwait last week.
   But other traders expect the dollar to weaken, as the Middle
East situation settles down and attention refocuses on the
weakening U.S. economy and the possibility of lower U.S. interest
rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 149.68 Japanese yen from
150.00 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 149.80
yen. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 149.735 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8720 from $1.8660 late
Wednesday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8685.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.5915 German marks, down from 1.5940; 1.3385
Swiss francs, down from 1.3435; 5.3340 French francs, down from

   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.5960
German marks, 1.3440 Swiss francs, 1,166.45 Italian lire and
1.14685 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to $385.25 a troy ounce, up from $382.25
late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $385.00 an ounce, up

<HEAD>President of Thrifty Corp. Resigns; 100 Stores to Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Thrifty Corp. announced his
resignation and said 50 to 100 of its stores would be closed in two
years.
   Richard G. Eils, who began his career with Thrifty 25 years ago
as an industrial engineer, announced his departure after serving as
chief executive since February and president for 10 years. Eils,
52, said he is leaving to pursue other interests.
   His replacement as president, Daniel Seigel, practiced law and
had never worked in the retail industry before joining Thrifty in
March as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
   Seigel, who began his tenure with Thrifty's parent, Pacific
Enterprises, in 1974, was promoted to president of the company's
alternative energy and leasing businesses before working for
Thrifty.
   He will be in charge of Thrifty's day-to-day operations, while
Leonard H. Straus remains company chairman.
   Thrifty's chief executive position, meanwhile, was left vacant.
Company officials said they will begin interviewing candidates with
executive retailing experience, but said no decision had been made
on whether the job would be filled.
   No decision was announced on which stores will be closed. As
many as 2,000 employees could be affected by the shutdowns, but
officials said dismissals would be kept to a minimum by
transferring workers to healthy stores.
   Thrifty's seven chains include Thrifty, Thrifty, Jr. and Big 5
Sporting Goods. It operates 1,070 drugstores and sporting goods
shops, accounting for 29,000 of Pacific Enterprises' 40,000
employees and close to half of its revenue.
   Price-slashing by such competitors as the Sav-On drugstore chain
have hurt the stores' business. Last year, Thrifty brought in only
one-fifth of its after-tax operating income.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Pacific Enterprises said it lost $229
million in the second quarter, stemming from a one-time accounting
charge of $275 million. Analysts predict the loss will result in
higher earnings for the energy and retailing company in future
quarters.

   Stock prices advanced in subdued trading today
as investors focused on narrow segments of the market and assumed a
wait-and-see attitude while events continued to unfold in the
Persian Gulf.
   Traders said much of the day's activity centered on retail and
energy issues. The nation's major stores reported mixed July sales
today, and oil stocks continued to attract attention as U.S. forces
take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia to protect the world's
largest oil exporter.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 15.60
points at 2,750.50 at midafternoon.

Stock Exchange,with 737 issues up, 656 issues down and 549

   Volume on the floor of the Big Boardtotaled 105.49 million
shares at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices seesawed in a narrow range but began a more
decisive move upward in afternoon trading. Nervousness surrounding
the Treasury's sale of $10.25 billion in 30-year bonds was
alleviated as early indications pointed to satisfactory demand for
the issues. The bond sale came on the heels of a disappointing
response to Wednesday's 10-year note auction.
   While traders believe the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia will deter further aggressive moves by Iraq, the fact that
Iraq is unwilling to leave Kuwait after last week's invasion
continues to cloak the market in a veil of uncertainty.
   ``What's dominated the market is concern about whether the
Iraqis will attack Saudi Arabia'' and whether the situation will
overheat, said Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   He noted that most investors are lightly exposed to stocks and
aren't likely to ``hop aboard'' until there is more definitive news
out of the Middle East.

   Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose in
Thursday's auction to the highest level in more than a year as the
government concluded its quarterly refunding.
   The average yield was 8.87 percent, up from 8.84 percent at the
last auction on May 10.
   It was the highest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 9.11
percent on May 11, 1989. The notes will carry a coupon interest
rate of 8} percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for
$9,874.70.
   A total of $10.3 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling
$26 billion.
   The Treasury on Thursday also sold $10.1 billion in 36-day cash
management bills with an average discount rate of 7.79 percent.
   The discount rate understates the actual return to investors:
7.96 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,922.10.
   The refunding included the sale of $11.5 billion in three-year
notes on Tuesday and $10.5 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday.
   The notes and bonds are regularly sold at auctions held four
times a year to replenish the government's coffers. Undersecretary
Robert Glauber said the proceeds this week would refund $20 billion
of privately-held notes maturing on Aug. 15 and raise approximately
$12.25 billion in cash.

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybean Futures Rally Ahead of Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures prices rallied strongly
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a final round of
jockeying for position ahead of an eagerly awaited Agriculture
Department crop report.
   Corn futures fell slightly.
   John Frazier, director of agricultural trading with Gerald Inc.,
said the market moves reflected expectations that the government
would project a larger 1990 U.S. corn crop and a smaller soybean
crop than last year.
   A pre-report survey of grain analysts yielded corn production
estimates averaging 7.92 billion bushels compared with last year's
7.53 billion.
   Analyst estimates for 1990 U.S. soybean production averaged 1.86
billion bushels versus last year's 1.93 billion.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the USDA
projected corn production at 7.85 billion bushels and soybean
production at 1.84 billion bushels.
   Both numbers were below market expectations and were expected to
prompt higher openings in those markets on Friday.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.90{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1} cents lower with September at $2.50{ a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to 3 cents higher with September at $1.19{ a

at $5.98 a bushel.

   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday its
profit fell 44 percent in the second quarter and British Petroleum
Co. PLC posted an 89 percent drop.
   They each cited weaker crude oil prices in the period that ended
more than a month before prices rocketed higher after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Royal Dutch-Shell said its results also reflected lower margins
in its chemical division and the weakness of the dollar.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands,
and in London, said its net income for the three months ended June
30 fell to 563 million pounds, or $940 million, from 1.01 billion
pounds a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 4 percent to 16.7 billion pounds, or $27.9 billion,
from 16.1 billion pounds a year earlier.
   ``The outlook for the rest of the year is obviously extremely
uncertain and almost entirely dependent on how events in the Middle
East unfold,'' Royal-Dutch Shell said.
   The company said its net income for the first half fell 40
percent to 1.38 billion pounds, or $2.3 billion, from 2.29 billion
pounds a year ago.
   Revenue rose 12.8 percent to 34.2 billion pounds, or $57
billion, from 30.36 billion pounds a year earlier.
   London-based BP, which owns Cleveland-based Standard Oil Co.,
said its second-quarter net income fell to 53 million pounds, or
$92 million, from 477 million pounds a year earlier.
   Its revenue fell 1 percent to 7.26 billion pounds, or $12.2
billion, in the quarter from 7.34 billion pounds a year earlier.
   For the half year, net profit plummeted to 397 million pounds,
or $663 million, from 1.09 billion pounds a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 10 percent to 15.3 billion pounds, or
$25.5 billion, from 13.9 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The results for both companies are not directly comparable with
those for American companies, since they use an accounting method
that values inventories at their acquisition costs rather than at
current costs. American companies generally use a method that
values inventories at current costs.

<HEAD>Chrysler Delaying Development of Luxury Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is delaying the
introduction of a new luxury car in favor of a vehicle to succeed
its compact Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim, a company executive
said Thursday.
   ``We're going to adjust the timing of the LX,'' said Glenn
Gardner, Chrysler's general manager of new platform engineering,
referring to the code name for the new luxury car.
   The LX originally was to be introduced shortly after the
so-called LH went into production. But because a successor to the
Spirit-Acclaim has a potential to sell better than a luxury car
and, consequently, return more profit for the investment, it was
decided to push back the LX, Gardner said.
   He said the most pressing priority for the company is the LH, a
midsize car due out in the fall of 1992 as a 1993 model, and there
is some pressure in the corporation to bring the car out earlier.
   ``Mr. Iacocca said he wants six months (cut from the
introduction schedule). I told him he can't have it,'' Gardner
said, referring to company Chairman Lee Iacocca. ``He's a very
persistent individual.''
   The realignment comes about a year after Iacocca said a
billion-dollar cost-cutting program would not alter the development
plans for new vehicles.
   ``Our $15 billion, five-year program remains intact and we don't
comment on sepecific future products that are contained in that
program,'' Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said.
   Gardner's comments came during the fourth day of a week-long
management conference sponsored by the University of Michigan.
   Wall Street analysts have criticized Chrysler for opting to
build the Viper low-volume, high-performance sports car when the
company should accelerate development of the LH midsize car.
   Between the introduction of the LH and the Spirit-Acclaim
successor, Chrysler is expected to bring out a new subcompact car.
Chrysler left the subcompact segment when it shut down the Detroit
assembly plant that built the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizion last
February.
   The Spirit-Acclaim successor will be introduced sometime around
1995, Gardner said. Those cars were introduced in the spring of
1989 and are assembled in Newark, Del.
   Also at the conference, Ford Motor Co. officially unveiled its
4.6-liter, V-8 engine for the 1991 Lincoln Town Car which goes into
production later this year.
   The engine to be built at Ford's $780 million revamped engine
plant in Romeo, Mich., is the first of the company's ``modular''
family of engines. Modular engines give manufacturers flexibility
and cost reductions by creating common basic engine structure with
interchangeable components giving each kind of engine its own
characteristics.
   ``Overall, we estimate the new family of engines will share
about 350 parts, or about 75 percent of the engine,'' said David F.
Hagen, general manager of Ford's engine division. ``New V-8
variations will cost about $60 million to develop compared to about
$500 million for a typical new engine program.''
   He said the modular engine concept will be expanded to Ford's
huge Cleveland engine plant, which will build a new series of V-6
engines to enter production in the mid-1990s.
   Meantime, Richard Donnelly, head of General Motors Corp.'s newly
created Engine Division, said the company is moving to consolidate
its engine research, development and manufacturing, which could
close an engine plant sometime in the future.
   He did not say which factory may be affected.

   The stock market moved solidly higher today in a
late rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.29 at 2,756.19
with five minutes left to go in the session.

<HEAD>Energy Delegates Assess Impact of Middle East Oil Crisis</HEAD>

   Emergency oil stockpiles do not yet need to be
tapped to make up for an embargo against Iraq and Kuwait, delegates
from industrialized nations decided Thursday.
   But the 21-nation International Energy Agency will take steps to
``sharpen preparedness if the situation deteriorates,'' said
Chairman Ulrich Engelmann. ``We must be prepared for that.''
   Concluding a daylong meeting to assess the impact of the
boycott, the IEA decided enough oil exists on world markets to
forestall dipping into emergency reserves.
   Engelmann blamed speculation for dramatic increases in oil
prices, but said the higher prices should dampen demand. He
predicted some OPEC members will boost production, but did not say
which ones or by how much.
   Conservation and switches from oil-based fuels to natural gas
would also help to keep stocks high, he said.
   The IEA is empowered to help its members survive the potentially
damaging loss of loss of 4.2 million barrels of oil per day
produced by Iraq and Kuwait.
   The members are ready to use their emergency stockpiles and to
share them with each other if necessary, said a Canadian delegate
on condition of anonymity.
   IEA members include the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, and most Western European countries except France,
Finland and Iceland.
   Oil supplies have not been affected by the boycott yet,
Engelmann said, because shipments from Iraq or Kuwait to IEA
countries normally take 10 days. The United Nations imposed the
embargo Monday to punish Iraq's invasion of its smaller neighbor a
week ago.
   Delegates will meet again in two weeks, when the market could
begin to feel the shortfall.
   The IEA's two main weapons are to inject emergency stockpiles
into the market, or share oil with members suffering the worst
shortages.
   The emergency stock-sharing program is the group's ultimate
weapon. It is supposed to take effect when 7 percent of projected
supplies to the entire IEA or any of its members is obstructed.
   Once triggered, the system allots oil reserves to member
countries according to a preset formula.
   U.S. Assistant Energy Secretary John Easton said neither measure
is immediately necessary. But the United States favors putting oil
from its 590 million-barrel stockpile on the market as simpler.
   ``We will draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ in
cooperation with our allies _ if the severity of the situation
warrants it,'' he said.
   The IEA issued a communique urging countries to refrain from
``abnormal purchases'' of petroleum.
   ``Companies should show restraint by avoiding abnormal spot
market purchases or other undesirable purchases of oil during the
period of this supply disruption,'' the statement said.
   Engelmann, of West Germany, said the group found no evidence oil
companies had taken advantage of the invasion to boost prices.
   IEA Executive Director Helga Steeg said the group does not plan
to deal with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on
supply questions. Iran has shown interest in such talks.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena said in Algeria on Wednesday that
individual OPEC members should avoid breaking ranks to increase
production unilaterally.

   Crosman Products is recalling nearly 53,000
air rifles that may have a defective trigger mechanism, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.
   The company is recalling its Model 3100 air rifle, which has
been sold nationally since July 1986 and may contain an improperly
hardened sear in its trigger.
   If the sear is not properly hardened, it may wear prematurely
and the consumer may not be able to cock the airgun, the commission
said.
   If the consumer does manage to cock a gun with a defective sear,
it said, the rifle could discharge unexpectedly without the trigger
being pulled _ even if the safety mechanism is engaged.
   The commission said no reports of injury or accidental discharge
have been received. Crosman discovered the problem after inspecting
a returned airgun that would not cock.
   Consumers who own Crosman Model 3100 air rifles should
discontinue use and call the company toll free at 1-800-836-3100
for instructions. The line is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EDT,
Monday through Friday.
   The East Bloomfield, N.Y., company will inspect all returned
rifles, replace defective sears and return the airguns at no charge.

   Stocks advanced solidly today in a late rally
sparked by positive response to the Treasury's latest bond auction
and the absence of any further escalation of hostilities in the
Middle East.
   Stock prices seesawed in a narrow range but began a more
decisive move upward in midafternoon. Nervousness surrounding the
Treasury's sale of $10.25 billion in 30-year bonds was alleviated
when the government received $25.96 billion in bids for the issues.
   ``When the results of the auction were released, the bond
futures rallied and took the stock market along,'' said Alfred E.
Goldman, a vice president at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
Inc.
   The market was particularly nervous about the auction, which
made up the final leg of a three-part record refunding, because
Wednesday's sale of 10-year notes went off poorly.
   Traders said much of the day's activity centered on retail and
energy stocks. The nation's major stores reported mixed July sales,
and oil stocks continued to attract attention as U.S. forces took
up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia to protect the world's
largest oil exporter.
   Traders believe the presence of U.S. forces there will deter
further aggressive moves by Iraq. But they assumed a wait-and-see
attitude as Arab leaders gathered in Cairo for a high-stakes summit
on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

   Bondholders in Australian businessman Alan Bond's
financially troubled Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. failed to agree to
the sale of the company's brewing assets, a company director said
Thursday.
   Alan Bond said last month he would resign as chairman of
Australia-based Bond Corp. if shareholders and bondholders approved
the 1.85 billion Australian dollar ($1.5 billion) sale, and two
other proposals.
   Most of the bondholders who attended a meeting in London
Thursday voted in favor of the resolutions but the vote fell short
of the required 75 percent, director Peter Lucas said.
   Holders of sterling bonds agreed to the sale of the brewing
assets to Bell Resources Ltd., which is 58 percent controlled by
Bond Corp., but U.S. bondholders did not, he said.
   U.S. bondholders are to be asked to meet Nov. 10 to vote again,
he said.
   Both types of bondholders also failed to agree to a 12-month
moratorium on bondholders' interest payments and the formation of a
committee to discuss the restructuring of Bond Corp.'s debt.
   They will meet again on Nov. 30, Lucas said.

<HEAD>SEC Alleges Fraud and Manipulation in New Jersey Firm's Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
complaint Thursday alleging fraud and stock manipulation during the
public offering and subsequent trading of over-the-counter
securities of a New Jersey manufacturing company.
   The firm, Beres Industries Inc. of Lakewood, N.J., two of its
officers and the president, and three traders of the now-defunct
brokerage that executed the offering were named in the lawsuit
filed in Newark, N.J.'s federal court.
   The complaint seeks more than $1 million in alleged illegal
profits from Beres chairman, Charles Beres, and his son and company
president, Charles Beres Jr.
   It also seeks unspecified profits from the brokerage employees.
SEC attorney David Miller said the firm, Monmouth Investments Inc.,
made about $3 million through the alleged illegal practices.
   The SEC said Beres Sr. and Monmouth president Arden R. Brown
failed to disclose to regulators an agreement in which Beres would
sell 1.2 million shares of his privately held securities to
Monmouth at below-market prices.
   The complaint further alleged that after the July 1986 public
offering, Monmouth dominated the market of Beres securities through
``boiler room'' selling tactics and artificially manipulated the
stock price through various schemes.
   Monmouth, a former member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, was based in Englishtown, N.J., and had 14
branch offices with about 10,000 customer accounts. It went out of
business in March 1989.

   U.S. financial markets steadied today as traders assessed the
military developments in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose
24.01 to 2,758.91, buoyed mostly by a positive response to a
Treasury auction.
   ``Everyone is sitting around watchfully waiting,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, an executive at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. She predicted little movement in either direction.
   ``With a weekend coming, I don't think anyone is going to step
out and try to be a hero by buying the market,'' Zagorski said.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average rebounded from six straight
losing sessions to gain 24.26 points.
   In the oil market today, the September contract for the U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil lost 29 cents to settle
at $25.67 per 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract plummeted by $2.35 per barrel Wednesday following
reports that other oil-producing countries would step up production
to cover any disruption in shipments from Iraq.
   A barrel of North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was
up 7 cents in London trading at $25.05 per barrel.
   Elsewhere, stock prices tumbled in Tokyo and the dollar firmed
in cautious foreign exchange trading.
   Worries that Japan will be jolted by a disruption in oil imports
discouraged Japanese investors, despite the rebound on Wall Street.
Japan relies on imports for virtually all of its oil needs.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 893.41 points, or 3.13 percent, ending the day at 27,615.73,
its lowest level since Oct. 25, 1987, when the key index closed at
27,421.49.
   Meanwhile, stock prices rolled forward in London in a recovery
triggered in part by Wall Street's strength a day earlier. The
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 7.4 points at
2,244.9 at the close.
   Currency dealers in Europe said the dollar was firming in the
absence of major news on the Persian Gulf.
   In late London dealings, the dollar was quoted at 149.80
Japanese yen, down from its earlier Tokyo close of 149.68 yen. The
dollar also lost ground against the German mark in Europe, slipping
to 1.5915 marks, from 1.5940 marks late Wednesday.
   In New York dealings, the dollar was quoted at 149.85 yen and
1.5985 marks.
   In the American credit markets, long-term Treasury bonds rallied
on the strength of a refunding auction that attracted greater
demand than expected. In late trading, 30-year issues were up about
$8 per $1,000, yielding 8.75 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 522 money market mutual
funds rose by a sharp $6.03 billion in the latest week, as Middle
East tensions prompted an exodus of investors from stocks and
bonds, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a new high of $401.94 billion in the seven-day
period ended Wednesday, followed a revised $1.30 billion increase
in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The previous week's total also was revised, to $395.91 billion.
   The influx of cash came as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
subsequent tensions caused gyrations in the stock and bond markets
due to speculation about the possible economic impact of events in
the key oil-producing region.
   ``Investors moved out of stocks and bonds in light of unsettled
markets and placed their money in money market funds,'' said Jacob
Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the institute.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market
collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 249 general purpose funds rose $3.7 billion to $139.42
billion, assets of 104 broker-dealer funds rose $946.9 million to
$162.24 billion, and assets of 169 institutional funds rose $1.39
billion to $100.29 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.50 percent from 7.56 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.58 percent from 7.62 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, up from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.10 percent as of Wednesday from 6.11 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.04 percent from 5.02 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.75
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.81 the
previous week. Yields were 7.90 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.97 percent; 7.96 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.02 percent;
and 8.06 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.11 percent.

   William H. Donaldson, a Wall Street veteran and
friend of President Bush, was named Thursday as chairman and chief
executive of the New York Stock Exchange.
   Donaldson, 59, will succeed John J. Phelan Jr., who won wide
praise for safely steering the nation's largest exchange through
the 1987 stock market crash and helping to avert a protracted world
financial crisis.
   The NYSE's board also named president Richard A. Grasso, who had
wanted the top post, as executive vice chairman with expanded
responsibilities. Both appointments take effect Jan. 1.
   Donaldson, a co-founder of the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette Inc., brings broad experience on Wall Street, in
government and academia to one of the most high-profile jobs in
American business.
   He arrives at a time of rapid technological change, global
market interdependence and increased competition overseas that
threaten to redefine the basic structure of the 198-year-old
exchange, a worldwide symbol of capitalism.
   ``This is one of the most challenging jobs in the country
today,'' Donaldson told a news conference at the exchange in lower
Manhattan. ``The opportunity to be here at a time of great change
appeals to my spirit.''
   Donaldson's first job on Wall Street was at the old brokerage
G.H. Walker &amp; Co., run by Bush's uncle Herbert Walker. Donaldson
was a classmate of the president's brother, Jonathan, at Yale
University and is friends with the Bush family.
   In 1959, just one year out of Harvard Business School, Donaldson
and two friends founded Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He left in
1973 after the company grew from its initial $100,000 investment to
the nation's 10th largest brokerage.
   Donaldson served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, first as
an undersecretary of state to Henry Kissinger in 1973-74 before
becoming special White House counsel to vice president Nelson
Rockefeller.
   A Yale trustee, Donaldson in 1975 helped create a graduate
business school and served as dean of Yale's School of Organization
and Management until 1980, when he returned to Wall Street to open
a private investment firm, Donaldson Enterprises Inc.
   ``He's coming from a major background,'' said Muriel Siebert, a
Wall Street veteran who heads her own brokerage. ``He knows (the
NYSE) from a business basis because he has headed a firm. He knows
his way around Washington and politics.''
   ``The combination is important,'' said Primerica Inc. President
Jeffrey Lane, a board member of the competing American Stock
Exchange. ``The industry needs a strong leader who can pick up the
baton that John Phelan is passing. He has all the right
credentials.''
   Donaldson becomes the fourth full-time, paid chairman of the Big
Board since the job was created in 1972. He was tabbed by a
nine-member search panel appointed after Phelan in February
announced plans to retire at the end of the year.
   Donaldson is known on Wall Street for leading and winning a
fight against the NYSE to lift a ban on publicly owned securities
firms. After the exchange agreed to let DLJ sell stock to the
public in 1969, many securities firms followed.
   Donaldson said among his main concerns will be the NYSE's role
in global securities trading and the ``maintenance, restoration and
enhancement of public confidence in the operation of the market''
that eroded after the 1987 crash.
   Among other challenges, he cited new forms of electronic
trading, the prospect of round-the-clock securities trading,
monitoring new regulation and wild fluctuations that have shaken
public confidence in the stock market.
   Donaldson praised Phelan's administration for being ``responsive
to the unexpected,'' during such events as the market gyrations
that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.
   Phelan, chairman since May 1984, will remain an advisor for NYSE
relations with foreign stock exchanges. He currently is chairman of
the International Federation of Stock Exchanges and has traveled
extensively during his tenure cultivating ties with markets abroad.
   Phelan, 59, said he will serve as chairman of the Aspen
Institute, a policy think tank that arranges speakers on various
issues, continue his work on foreign markets at the exchange and
serve on corporate boards.
   Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said the SEC looked forward to working with Donaldson.
He said Phelan ``consistently demonstrated strength, wisdom and
vision'' and ``helped to maintain both the integrity and the
competitiveness of the U.S. securities markets.''
   Grasso, 44, is a 22-year NYSE veteran. His additional
responsibilities were described by people familiar with the
selections as an inducement to keep him at the exchange. It was
widely known he had wanted the chairman's job.

<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance in U.S.
trading Thursday after moving mostly lower in earlier dealings
abroad.
   Gold prices gained.
   Interest in the dollar as a safe investment haven waned in the
absence of fresh Middle East hostility, currency dealers said.
   Earlier this week as outcry over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait
intensified, investors scrambled to buy dollars. Investors
typically turn to dollars in times of political and economic
uncertainty.
   A retreat in oil prices from the lofty levels reached in recent
days also paved the way for an end to the dollar-buying binge.
World oil transactions are conducted in dollars and a rapid runup
in petroleum prices had boosted demand for dollars.
   But on Thursday oil prices fell in the United States for a
second straight session. The contract for September delivery of
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
edged 29 cents a barrel lower to $25.67 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The dollar also was weighed down by concerns about the U.S.
economy's health. There has been widespread speculation that the
Federal Reserve soon will try to revive the faltering economy by
pushing down interest rates. Lower rates would reduce returns on
dollar-denominated investments and tend to curb demand for dollars.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo where the currency fell
to 149.68 Japanese yen at the close from 150.00 yen Wednesday.
Later in London, it rose to 149.80 yen. In late New York trading,
the dollar was quoted at 149.805 yen, down from 149.90 yen late
Wednesday.
   The dollar strengthened against the British pound in New York
trading after weakening in London. A pound fetched $1.8680 late in
New York, compared to $1.86885 late Wednesday. In London, sterling
rose to $1.8720 from $1.8660 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.5965 German marks, up from
1.5920; 1.3435 Swiss francs, down from 1.3380; 5.3510 French
francs, down from 5.3365; 1,168.50 Italian lire, up from 1,165.00;
and 1.14695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14785.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday,
were: 1.5915 German marks, down from 1.5940; 1.3385 Swiss francs,
down from 1.3435; 5.3340 French francs, down from 5.3445; 1.7930
Dutch guilders, down from 1.7955; 1,164.75 Italian lire, down from
1,166.37, and 1.1467 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1485.
   Precious metals prices posted scattered gains.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $385.80 a troy ounce, up $2.60 from Wednesday's
settlement. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted an
ounce of gold at $385.60, $2.90 higher than Wednesday's late bid.
   Gold rose in London to $385.25 an ounce from $382.25 late
Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $385.00 an ounce, up from
$384.35 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.52 an ounce to $384.17.
   Silver bullion prices were flat to modestly higher. On New
York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.857
a troy ounce, up from $4.843 Wednesday. An ounce of silver was
unchanged in London at $4.87.

   The stock market advanced Thursday as investors
were encouraged by a successful Treasury auction and the absence of
further negative news out of the Middle East.
   Stock prices seesawed in a narrow range before moving decisively
upward at midday. The gains, however, were not entirely broad
based. Much activity centered on retail issues, since the nation's
major chain stores reported July sales, and on energy stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.01 points to
close at 2,758.91. The advance builds upon Wednesday's 24-point
rise, which snapped a six-session losing streak.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
837 up, 695 down and 474 unchanged.
   Trading was subdued. Volume on the floor of the Big Board came
to 155.81 million shares, down from 190.40 million in the previous
session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 188.04 million shares.
   Activity was lackluster early in the session, but nervousness
mounted ahead of the Treasury's sale of $10.25 billion in 30-year
bonds. Traders continued to reflect on Wednesday's auction of
10-year notes, which went very poorly.
   But the government received a healthy $25.96 billion in bids in
the final leg of a three-part record refunding, and the yields on
the bonds were lower than expected. On that, ``the the bond futures
rallied and took the stock market along,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
a vice president at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   With stock prices already depressed, Goldman said the
``conditions were there, and the bond market provided the excuse''
to buy.
   Looking to the Middle East, traders were relieved that
hostilities did not escalate. Still, they were monitoring events as
Arab leaders gathered in Cairo for a high-stakes summit on Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Everyone is still very concerned ... but the fact that there
is still no blow-up over there ... gives (the Arabs) time to mend
some fences,'' said William Lord, first vice president at Shearson
Lehman Brothers.
   He predicted traders will lighten up their stock holdings on
Friday so they are not exposed over the weekend.
   In the retail sector, Wal-Mart led the Big Board actives list,
rising &rsqb; to 30|. Elsewhere, K mart was down &rsqb; at 30&rsqb;; Sears Roebuck
was up | at 30\; J.C. Penney was down ~ at 52\, and Limited was up

   Oil stocks were mixed. Texaco was up &lsqb; at 62~; Mobil was down {
at 65~; Exxon was up &lsqb; at 51~ and Amoco was up { at 56}. Many major
oil companies rolled back or froze their gasoline prices.
   Among other actively traded issues, Unitel was up 1 at 25&rsqb;;
General Motors slipped &lsqb; to 40~; Philip Morris gained ~ to 46{ and
Boeing jumped 1{ to 54{.
   Leading the actives list on the Amex was Continental Airlines,
which gained 1} to 6\. The carrier confirmed Chairman Frank Lorenzo
was stepping down.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $18.43 billion, or 0.57
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.84 to 186.24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.24 to 401.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.59 at 339.94.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 5.25 to 412.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 341.49, up 1.46.

<HEAD>Markets Steadying From Iraq Shock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices sank and stocks advanced Thursday for the second
straight day in the absence of fresh shocks from the Persian Gulf.
   ``We're in the eye of a hurricane right now,'' said Peter
Beutel, an oil trader for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Most
people believe something else is going to happen, but we don't know
what.''
   Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait a week ago caused severe
reactions across all financial markets as traders fretted about
possible disruptions of oil shipments from the Middle East.
   Although those concerns persist, the movement of U.S. troops
into the region to defend Saudi Arabia against a strike from Iraq
have reassured many traders the past two days. In addition, other
oil-producing nations have indicated they would increase production
to counter a cutoff of oil from Iraq.
   In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30
blue-chip stocks gained 24.01 to finish at 2,758.91, extending a
rebound that began with a 24.26-point jump Wednesday.
   In the oil market, the September contract for U.S. crude oil
lost 29 cents to settle at $25.67 per 42-gallon barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract had plummeted $2.35 per
barrel Wednesday.
   Crude oil contracts traded between $25.35 and $26.60 per barrel
Thursday, which some traders described as the narrowest range in
the last several trading sessions.
   ``There was no fresh news that would make us react,'' Beutel
said. ``Everybody's playing defense right now.''
   Reports during the day about the movement of Iraqi and U.S.
troops caused some blips in the market, but in general, those
reports were not a major concern.
   ``The build-up of troops is not a plus or a minus at this
point,'' said Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It's
what takes place with oil supplies now.''
   Statements aired at an emergency meeting of the 21-nation
International Energy Agency in Paris further bolstered confidence
about supplies.
   ``Presently there is not a significant shortfall of crude oil in
the market,'' U.S. Assistant Energy Secretary John Easton told
delegates from industrialized nations.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
the near-term contract for home heating oil dropped .36 cent to
69.77 cents per gallon. The September contract for unleaded
gasoline gained .21 cent to 76.42 cents per gallon, partly on
technical trading factors.
   Elsewhere, stock prices tumbled in Tokyo after making strong
gains the previous day. Oil worries have been harder to shake in
Japan, which relies on imports for virtually all of its energy
needs.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 893.41 points, or 3.13 percent, ending the day at 27,615.73,
its lowest level since Oct. 25, 1987, when the key index closed at
27,421.49.
   Stock prices made slight gains in London in a recovery triggered
in part by Wall Street's rebound on Wednesday. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 7.4 points at 2,244.9.
   In the currency markets, the dollar was mixed in New York after
drifting lower in overseas trading. With the price of oil dropping,
so was the demand for dollars, which are used to conduct the
world's oil transactions.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 149.805 yen,
down from 149.90 yen late Wednesday. The dollar fetched 1.5965
German marks, up from 1.5920.
   In the American credit markets, long-term Treasury bonds rallied
on the strength of a surprisingly strong auction of new issues. The
rally lowered spot interest rates, which helped propel the stock
market's rise.

<HEAD>Money Supply Higher In Latest Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 30, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,270.4 billion from a revised $3.270.1 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,056.8 billion from $4,056.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $809.8 billion from $807.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.1 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.0 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,269.4 billion, a 0.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,056.1 billion, down 0.6 percent, while M1
rose 1.8 percent to an average of $808.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.178 billion,
compared with a rise of $383 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $455 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$522 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $220
million in the two weeks ended Aug. 8, down from a revised $351
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $309.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Aug. 8, down from $309.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Tough Guy in the Airline Business Says He's Out of There, For Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline boss Frank Lorenzo said Thursday he's
quitting the flying empire he built in the 1980s, hurt by a barrage
of bad publicity and labor bitterness about his tough-guy
management style.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. to Scandinavian Airlines System.
The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake in Houston-based
Continental for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President Hollis L. Harris.
Harris, a highly respected manager, was lured to Continental after
a discreet search that started four months ago.
   Lorenzo will receive nearly $30 million in severance, retain a
small interest in Continental's stock options and keep a seat on
the company's board of directors.
   But Lorenzo's influence in running the company virtually will
disappear and his compensation reflects a fraction of the value the
airline operation used to have in better times.
   Houston-based Continental Holdings, formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., once commanded 20 percent of the domestic airline market
through its ownership of Continental and Eastern airlines.
   But its business has been severely crimped by heavy debts and a
debilitating strike at Eastern that's now 17 months old. Last year
the parent company lost $885.6 million, an industry record.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, Lorenzo said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   He spoke to reporters at a New York news briefing, flanked by
Hollis and SAS Chairman Jan Carlzon. All three called the
arrangement a strategic move that would strengthen Continental into
a global airline for the 1990s.
   SAS, which is spending a total of $50 million in the deal, will
roughly double its stake to 18.4 percent of the company's voting
stock. Carlzon said SAS had no interest in gaining control of the
airline. Federal law already limits foreign ownership is limited to
25 percent.
   ``We think Continental has an interesting future,'' Carlzon
said. ``It's better to have 18.4 percent than 9.9 percent.''
   Wall Street reacted positively to the announcement, reflecting
investor optimism that the change would help Continental's business
improve.
   Its stock, which traded as high as $23.75 a share over the past
year but recently traded in the $4-5 range, rose $1.75 on the
American Stock Exchange in active trading to $6.75.
   Lorenzo's exit from the airline world marks the end of an era
that in many ways was shaped by him. From his initial plunge into
the flying business in the 1960s as an analyst for Trans World
Airlines and later as an executive of a small Texas airline
company, Lorenzo helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate
fares to the industry's first hostile takeover.
   But Lorenzo aroused labor hatred because of what unions called
his brutal tactics to cut employee costs, one of the biggest
expenses in the industry besides fuel.
   Lorenzo called his strategies necessary to stay profitable in
deregulated skies that allowed airlines to set their own fares and
fly wherever they wished _ enormous changes in an industry unused
to competition.
   His war with labor began after he won Continental Airlines in a
takeover bid in 1981. Two years later he plunged the airline into
bankruptcy court, scrapped union contracts and hired low-cost
replacements for striking workers.
   Lorenzo's reputation among unionists worsened after he bought
unprofitable Eastern Airlines in 1986. Three years later angry
unions struck, accusing Lorenzo of gutting the airline.
   He responded by placing Eastern in bankruptcy court, but its
enormous debts and enduring strike crippled the carrier and made
creditors increasingly edgy. Last April an irritated federal
bankruptcy judge gave control of Eastern to a trustee, which many
strikers regarded as vindication.
   Unionists reacted to Lorenzo's announcement Thursday with a mix
of satisfaction and resentment. The International Association of
Machinists, which has led the Eastern strike from the start, said
he was largely responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``Frank Lorenzo demolished Eastern Airlines, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued Continental
Airlines,'' said John Peterpaul, IAM general vice president.
``Those facts dampen our elation at seeing Lorenzo finally leaving
the industry. He is the epitome of what is wrong with corporate
America today.
   ``Our condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Prices Expected to Rise After Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain analysts predicted a rally in corn and soybean futures
prices after the Agriculture Department on Thursday released
harvest projections that fell short of market expectations.
   Soybean futures rose Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in
anticipation of the report. Wheat futures also advanced while corn
retreated.
   On other commodity markets, gold and silver futures advanced;
oil futures fell; and livestock and meat futures were mostly lower.
   Wheat futures settled 3{ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.90\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2 cents lower with September at $2.50\ a bushel; oats
were 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with September at $1.19{ a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 6\ cents higher with August at $5.98\
a bushel.
   In a report released after the close, the USDA estimated the
1990 corn harvest at 7.85 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last
year's crop. The government projected a soybean crop of 1.84
billion bushels, down 5 percent from last year's harvest of 1.93
billion bushels.
   Both numbers were below market expectations, which averaged 7.92
billion bushels for corn and 1.86 billion bushels for soybeans.
Analysts predicted corn futures would open 2 cents to 4 cents
higher Friday in reaction to the report while soybeans would open 5
cents to 10 cents higher.
   Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc., a Chicago-based
analytical firm, said soybeans would draw further support from the
USDA's projected drop in U.S. soybean stockpile.
   The government said soybean stocks are likely to fall from an
estimated 275 million bushels at the end of this month to 225
million bushels by Aug. 31, 1991, the end of the 1990-91 crop year.
The latter estimate was 40 million bushels below the USDA's July
projection.
   The government raised its projection for Aug. 31, 1991, corn
stocks to 1.21 billion bushels from last month's 1.13 billion. The
increase reflects expectations for a 19 million metric ton increase
in Soviet Union grain production over last year and a corresponding
8 million ton drop in Soviet grain imports.
   ``The corn market will have to grapple with what the wheat
market has been grappling with: less export demand,'' Karlin said.
   He said that in light of the projected decline in Soviet grain
purchases and the market's recent weakness, ``I'm not so sure
whether the positive implication will be able to hold over long
term.''
   Gold and silver futures ended higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange while oil futures retreated on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in see-saw trading that closely followed developments in
the standoff between Iraqi and U.S. troops in the Middle East.
   Analyst Peter Cardillo, who follows the oil and precious metal
markets for Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co., said he believes there is a 50
percent to 60 percent chance of an Arab solution to the problem,
possibly as early as Friday.
   But unless the Arab nations agree on a formula to end Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait and bring down oil prices, he said the
economies of the Western world will fall into a recession and
severely reduce demand for Arab oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 61 cents
lower with September at $25.67 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent
to 1.2 cents lower with September at 69.77 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.25 cents lower to .21 cent higher with September at
76.42 cents a gallon.
   Gold settled $2.40 to $2.60 higher with August at $385.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.4 cents higher with August at
$4.857 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .28 cent
lower to .77 cent higher with August at 78.77 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 89.77
cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with August at 56.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50
cent to 1.98 cents lower with August at 48.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Philips Earnings Fall Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earnings at N.V. Philips, the major Dutch
electronics company, fell sharply in the second quarter, the
company said Thursday.
   Philips said it earned the equivalent $20.6 million in the
quarter ended June 30, based on Thursday's value of the Dutch
guilder. That compares with a profit of $131.1 million in 1989's
second quarter.
   Revenue for the second quarter totaled $7.55 billion, down
marginally from $7.56 billion a year earlier.
   The results were an improvement from the first quarter, when
Philips reported a profit of about $3.2 million, down from $117
million a year earlier. The drastically lower results shocked
investors, leading to the resignation of Philips Chairman Cor van
der Klugt and lawsuits by U.S. sharholders.
   In June, Philips said in a statement that its 1990 profit would
be ``very low.''
   At an shareholders meeting last month, Philips said it would
undertake a major restructuring primarily involving its computer
division, which has performed poorly.

<HEAD>Schering Plough Withdraws Anti-Hypertensive Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. announced Thursday
that it was withdrawing from the market a blood pressure-reducing
drug that has been linked to isolated cases of liver damage.
   Though the number of toxicity cases ``was quite small in
relation to the number of patients using dilevalol, our decision
was taken in the best interest of the potential patient population
for the drug,'' Alexander Z. Lane, president of Schering-Plough
Research, said in a statement.
   The company said it was halting the sale of dilevalol in Japan
and Portugal _ the only two countries where it is sold over the
counter. A pending marketing application before the federal Food
and Drug Administration will be withdrawn, the company said.
   Company spokesman Linn Weiss said liver toxicity developed in 17
of 176,000 patients who had been taking the drug as part of
worldwide clinical trials or under the care of a physician.
   In all but one of the 17 cases, flu-like symptoms and fatigue
disappeared after the medication was discontinued, Weiss said. A
Japanese man taking the drug died, but Weiss said medical experts
could not link his death definitively to the anti-hypertensive drug.
   Sales of dilevalol in the first eight months since it was
introduced overseas totalled about $20 million, the company said.
   Withdrawing the drug from the market will not affect
Schering-Plough's financial performance or its projected earnings
per share this year, the company said.

<HEAD>UAL Workers, Investors Encouraged by Buyout Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   United Airlines workers and stock market
investors indicated Thursday they were encouraged by a decision
extending the life of an employee buyout bid.
   But the two-month reprieve granted late Wednesday by UAL Corp.,
United's parent company, offered no guarantee that the $4.38
billion, $201-per-share deal will get done.
   Indeed, there is some concern that a provision allowing UAL's
board to call off the deal at any time could hamper the buyout
group's ability to obtain financing commitments by the new Oct. 9
deadline.
   Steven Matthews, a spokesman for the union-led buyout group,
declined comment Thursday on that possibility. He said the group
was ``going forward'' and hoped to arrange financing commitments as
quickly as possible.
   Matthews also declined comment on a Wall Street Journal report
that the buyout group had requested a three-month extension.
   UAL stock initially rose on the New York Stock Exchange, trading
as high as $123, but it closed at $113.75, down 75 cents.
   Without the deadline extension, the bid to make United the
world's largest employee-owned company would have expired Thursday.
   The buyout group blamed its failure to line up loan commitments
on the Middle East crisis, which it said had ``slowed the progress
of its discussions with financing sources,'' according to a
statement issued Wednesday by UAL.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last week has caused airline fuel
prices to soar and airline stock prices to drop, presumably making
United a greater credit risk.
   Airline analyst Robert Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago,
said the Middle East situation ``provides a convenient alibi.''
   ``It certainly is a factor,'' he said. ``But the way events were
unfolding, it didn't seem the group would have financing arranged
by the deadline anyway.''
   Decker said the extension gives the buyout group more time to
either find financing or restructure its proposal, perhaps to
reduce the $155-per-share cash component of the offer.
   UAL indicated, though, that it would not accept a lower total
bid.
   Skepticism about the buyout mounted in recent weeks after three
large New York banks _ Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical Banking
Corp. and Citicorp _ withdrew from a group of banks that had begun
loan talks with the buyout group.
   The banks indicated they might be willing to make the loans if
the buyout group obtains other financing from non-bank sources. The
group reportedly is negotiating with a number of aircraft
manufacturers and parts suppliers for such financing.
   At least three other banks _ Bankers Trust New York Corp.,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Security Pacific Corp. _ are
continuing to discuss loan possibilities with the buyout group.

   Officials representing 2,500
union workers at Western Union Corp. on Thursday said they have
rejected the company's proposal to extend an expired contract by 90
days.
   Union employees have been working under the terms of the
two-year contract since it expired Aug. 6.
   Union members have authorized their leadership to call a strike,
but a settlement deadline has not been set, Dan J. Beckstead,
president of the Communications Workers of America-United Telegraph
Workers Bargaining Council, said.
   Warren Bechtel, a spokesman for Upper Saddle River-based Western
Union, said more than 1,000 workers have been trained to replace
striking union workers.
   Bechtel has been close-mouthed on the substance of the talks,
but Beckstead said Western Union has given ground on two crucial
issues, while maintaining a firm stand on its attempt to cut
medical costs by putting union workers' medical benefits on par
with those offered to non-union employees.
   The two sides have been negotiating this week at a hotel in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   The CWA represents operators, customer relations clerks, other
clerical workers and field technicians that work for Western Union
nationwide, Beckstead said.
   Meanwhile Thursday, the company said it lost $27.6 million, or
44 cents a share, on revenues of $146 million in the second
quarter. The company lost $4.9 million, or 40 cents a share, on
revenue of $158 million in the second quarter of 1989.
   Western Union said the loss in the April-June period of this
year was due at least partly to costs incurred with the firm's
proposed recapitalization plan.
   Total revenues for the first six months of 1990 were $291
million, down 8 percent from revenues of $316 million for the first
half of 1989.

   An attorney formerly with a prestigious
corporate law firm was accused Thursday of selling inside
information about planned takeovers in a multimillion-dollar
trading scheme.
   The lawyer, Steven L. Glauberman, was charged with four counts
of conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud in a criminal
information brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
   Glauberman, 39, of Manhattan, was an associate at the firm,
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, where he specialized in
mergers and acquisitions.
   The government alleged he leaked inside information about
clients involved in some of the best-known takeovers of the 1980s
to a stock broker, who passed it along to others.
   Glauberman simultaneously settled a civil complaint by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay back $221,000
in his alleged illegal profits.
   The SEC said he tipped off Eban Smith, a former broker-dealer at
the Stamford, Conn., office of Smith Barney &amp; Co., to 29 planned or
pending corporate transactions between 1984 and 1989.
   These included Bristol Meyers' 1985 bid for Genetic Systems, a
management leveraged buyout of National Gypsum, also in 1985, Black
and Decker's 1988 unsolicited bid for American Standard, Walt
Disney Co.'s offer for Gibson Greetings, and K mart's bid for
Payless Drugstore Stores Northwest Inc.
   The SEC said Smith paid Glauberman $50,000 for the information
and also traded in a special account for Glauberman's benefit.
   Glauberman's attorney, Martin Perschetz, said he had no comment
on behalf of his client.
   Smith, 41, of Greenwich, Conn., was charged in a separate
criminal indictment with using the information he obtained from
Glauberman to buy and sell securities for his own account and to
solicit more business for his firm.
   In addition, two other investors who allegedly were tipped off
by Smith were charged criminally with making trades based on the
information from Glauberman.
   They are Peter H. Jeffer, 44, a Manhattan money manager, and
Stanley P. Patrick, 43, of Old Lyme, Conn., a former stock trader.
Jeffer Management Corp., a New York corporation created by Jeffer
that stopped doing business in 1988, was also named in the
indictment.
   Court papers said Smith, Jeffer and Patrick earned a total $3.75
million in illegal profits through the trades. The SEC said Smith's
portion of profits was more than $1.1 million.
   Smith, Jeffer and Patrick also were named in the SEC civil
complaint. Jeffer settled, but Smith and Patrick did not, meaning
the commission is still trying to recover their alleged profits in
the scheme.
   In addition, Glauberman's sister Lori, an associate director in
the preferred stock department of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., was accused
by the SEC of trading in the securities of at least 11 of the deals.
   According to the SEC, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
Glauberman agreed to disgorge $221,098; his sister, Lori, 36,
agreed to disgorge $19,135.
   Jeffer and his company would have been liable to disgorge $1.77
million but the SEC said that penalty was waived based on
affidavits that they were unable to pay.
   A sixth defendant in the SEC complaint, Anthony Correra, 55, of
Albuquerque, N.M., a former analyst and portfolio manager, will pay
back $496,842.
