<HEAD>Phillies' Mulholland Hurls Season's 8th No-Hitter, a Record</HEAD>

   Terry Mulholland of Philadelphia Phillies
pitched the eighth no-hitter of the baseball season Wednesday
night, the most ever by major league pitchers in one year.
   His performance, sealed in the ninth inning when third baseman
Charlie Hayes caught a line drive by pinch hitter Gary Carter,
lifted the Phillies to a 6-0 defeat of the San Francisco Giants.
   The season's eighth no-hitter surpassed the modern record of
seven set in 1917 and 1908.
   Mulholland (7-6) struck out eight and walked none in making
baseball history against the team that traded him to Philadelphia
last season.
   Only one batter reached base against Mulholland. Rick Parker
reached first base on Hayes' throwing error to lead off the seventh
inning, but was erased on a double play.
   It seemed only natural that the record would be surpassed in a
season already becoming known as the year of the no-hitter.
   The no-hit parade started on April 11 when the California
Angels' Mark Langston and Mike Witt combined to beat Seattle. Randy
Johnson then pitched the first no-hitter in Seattle history,
beating Detroit on June 2.
   Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers pitched his unprecedented sixth
no-hitter to beat the Oakland A's on June 11. Oakland's Dave
Stewart and the Los Angeles' Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela made
another bit of history on June 29 by pitching no-hitters on the
same day different leagues.
   Less than 24 hours later, Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees
pitched a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox _ but lost 4-0.
   On July 12, the Sox' Melido Perez pitched the record-tying
seventh no-hitter of the season, a rain-shortened six-inning
victory at Yankee Stadium.

<HEAD>Guardians Appointed for Children in Forced Bone Marrow Donor Case</HEAD>

   A judge on Wednesday appointed guardians for a
leukemia-stricken boy and his two young half-siblings, whom the
sick boy's father wants tested as potential bone-marrow donors.
   But the Illinois Supreme Court later stayed any action by the
guardians until it reconsiders its original order that they be
appointed.
   The high court gave no indication when it would reconsider that
ruling, Supreme Court spokesman John Madigan said.
   The father and the attorney for 12-year-old Jean-Pierre Bosze
said they hope the boy's 3-year-old twin half-brother and
half-sister would be tested if the guardians overlook the
objections of the twins' mother.
   ``Mom is making the wrong decision in this case,'' said the
children's father, Tamas Bosze of suburban Hoffman Estates. ``The
children would decide differently if they were grown up.
   ``If my brother asked me for a blood test, I would say `sure',''
Bosze said after the hearing.
   Jean-Pierre's doctor says a bone-marrow transplant is the boy's
only chance for survival, and the twins offer the best chance of a
match. Bosze, who fathered the twins by a former girlfriend, went
to court to force the testing after the woman refused to allow it.
   In an order July 18, Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds refused to
order the tests, saying it would be an invasion of the twins'
privacy.
   The Illinois Supreme Court last week sent the case back to
Reynolds with further hearing with an order that guardians be
appointed for the three children.
   Beverly Pekala, an attorney for the twins and their mother,
Nancy Curran, appealed the high court's order.
   ``The trial record is replete with evidence that all children
involved with this case have had their interests zealously
protected,'' Pekala said.
   But Attorney Edward Jordan, who represents Jean-Pierre, said the
more objective view provided by guardians can help the court as it
tries to balance the benefits to the boy versus the risk, pain or
inconvenience to the twins.
   Jordan said in his appeal to the high court that he wants time
to gather more evidence. He said this might include further medical
information and testimony by people who have been donors in other
cases.
   ``And if any parents whose children were donors want to come
forward, we'd be happy to talk to them,'' Jordan said.
   The boy's father said that Jean-Pierre's leukemia must be in
remission before he can receive a transplant.
   Bosze said his son recently underwent five days of chemotherapy
and that doctors are close to bringing the disease under control to
allow the operation.
   He said that many non-relatives have volunteered as donors, but
none has proven to be compatible.
   The guardians named by Reynolds are both Chicago attorneys _
Sheldon Engel for Jean-Pierre and Charles Fleck for the twins.

<HEAD>Rare Cases of Stroke Reportedly Caused by Lyme Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Heart Association is urging doctors
across the country to consider testing for Lyme disease in patients
with unexplained strokes.
   The suggestion comes after neurologists at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in Washington, D.C., reviewed 12 cases of stroke
caused by the disease contracted in Europe.
   The serious and possibly permanent brain damage that may result
from strokes ``make it imperative'' that infection with Lyme
disease ``be suspected in any atypical stroke ...,'' neurologists
Eugene May and Bahman Jabbari wrote in the August issue of Stroke,
a heart association journal.
   Jabbari is director of the epilepsy and neurophysiology section
at Walter Reed.
   ``I suspect strokes caused by Lyme disease have occurred in the
United States, but none has been reported so far,'' said May,
senior neurology resident at Walter Reed. ``Hopefully, ...
neurologists in the United States will start looking more closely
for Lyme disease infections in stroke patients.''
   The doctors were alerted to the Lyme-stroke connection when a
20-year-old U.S. Army soldier was transferred to Walter Reed in
January 1989, where it was determined he had suffered a stroke
triggered by an infecting agent that causes Lyme disease.
   The spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to humans
mainly by certain species of ticks, each about the size of a
pinhead.
   May and Jabbari found 11 similar cases in scientific literature,
and determined that all 12 had experienced meningitis and all had
been infected in Europe.
   But they noted that only a few of the European strains of the
Lyme spirochete are closely related to the strains that cause Lyme
disease in the United States.

<HEAD>Probe Finds Some Truth in Allegations of Nimitz Cheating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has confirmed that several
sailors aboard the USS Nimitz cheated on tests of their technical
knowledge of the aircraft carrier's nuclear reactor operations and
procedures.
   But the Navy said it found no evidence that such cheating would
harm the crew's ability to operate the ship. It denied public
allegations by four sailors of unsafe procedures aboard the ship,
including shortcuts in various systems tests and the possibility of
sabotage.
   It found that ``the ship's reactors are safe and that crew
members are qualified to operate them,'' the Navy said in a
statement Tuesday.
   The problem of ``several sailors'' cheating on exams was being
resolved by the Nimitz crew, the Navy said.
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., met Tuesday with Nuclear Reactors
Office head Adm. Bruce DeMars. Dicks said testing procedures
involving the Navy's nuclear reactors were being reviewed because
of the cheating.
   ``There were nine people out of 345 who were involved in
cribbing for exams, and that's simply unacceptable,'' Dicks said.
``But it didn't relate back to any safety problem on the ship.''
   Lt. Col. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman in San Diego, said the
exams require crew members in charge of reactor operations to
answer a short list of questions. The questions deal with their
technical knowledge of operations and procedures concerning the
power plant.
   Four sailors who said they work with the ship's nuclear
propulsion system had alleged on KIRO-TV on Aug. 3 that the crew
was overworked, cheating on examinations was widespread, and
shortcuts were being taken in the ship's system safety programs.
   They claimed many nuclear crew members did not have sufficient
knowledge to handle a nuclear accident and that some had considered
minor acts of sabotage against the reactor to ease their workload.
   The Navy said it found no evidence of sabotage or a conspiracy
to commit sabotage.

<HEAD>Consumers Warned of Investment Scams Tied to Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state regulators' group is warning consumers
about con artists who may try to exploit the crisis in the Persian
Gulf by peddling bogus oil, gas and precious metals investments.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association has
issued an investor bulletin to warn small investors about the
latest scams tied to recent developments in the Mideast.
   The group is an association of state government regulators that
periodically alerts the public to the latest twists in
consumer-related securities fraud.
   ``People shouldn't expect to make money overnight,'' Susan E.
Bryant, president of NASAA, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``If a legitimate oil company is going to profit from the Mideast
oil crisis, it's going to take a while.''
   She said the organization had no direct reports of Persian Gulf
oil-related scams, but there are ``rumors that they're on the
streets.''
   ``We usually don't get the complete story until someone figured
out they lost money, which could be several years down the road,''
she said.
   A con man's ``best friend is a headline or television news flash
out of the Mideast that threatens a disruption of oil supplies to
the United States,'' said Bryant, who is also administrator of the
Oklahoma Securities Department.
   Con artists previously have seized on the scam potential of
Mideast turmoil, including the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, the 1979
Iranian revolution and the tanker war during the Iran-Iraq war in
the 1980s, Bryant said.
   ``Investors should realize there are hundreds of high pressure
telephone sales operations in the United States that will be
burning up the phone lines with these kind of pitches for
non-existent or blatantly abusive investments,'' she said.
   Investors should not to give money to strangers who contact them
by phone, NASAA said. It also advised checking out whether an
investment is registered with state authorities and if the promoter
is licensed.
   The NASAA bulletin warned that crooks, through high pressure
telephone sales from temporary ``boiler room'' operations,
encourage investors to buy into oil partnerships for $5,000,
$10,000 or more.
   To sweeten the deal they say the gulf conflict will drive up oil
or commodity prices and the investor will be getting in early
enough to ride the price rise.
   But, NASAA advised, the wells in question often don't exist,
belong to someone else or are dry. Even a legitimate oil field can
take as long as two years to reach full production, the bulletin
stated.
   War and the rumor of war also can drive up the price of precious
metals such as gold, silver and platinum _ historically used as
investment hedges during times of uncertainty _ and attract scam
artists hawking bullion and coins, NASAA said.
   Investors should be particularly careful about promotions for
bank-financed or collateral loan programs involving gold or silver.
   The salesperson usually has made extravagant or misleading
claims about the profit potential and very often high commissions,
interest charges, storage fees and other expenses ``make it
extremely unlikely that an investor will see a penny of profit,''
the bulletin said.

   A two-day, nationwide
strike over sharply higher prices led to clashes between police and
protesters that left at least 11 people dead and 50 wounded,
authorities said today.
   The general strike virtually paralyzed the Caribbean nation of 7
million people on Monday and Tuesday. Nearly all stores, factories
and offices were closed and public transportation was scarce.
   Normal activity resumed today, however.
   The anti-government strike, which was organized by nine major
unions, led to violent confrontations between protesters and
security forces in the capital, Santo Domingo, and several other
cities.
   Police said the 11 people who died were all killed as a result
of bullets fired by police and soldiers to disperse unruly crowds.
   It was earlier reported that an 10-year-old girl had died after
being struck by a stone during looting, but police said today that
she was accidentally hit by a bullet. At least 50 protesters were
wounded and 2,000 arrested over the 48-hour strike period.
   The unions organized the protest in response to an austerity
program introduced last week by the government of President Joaquin
Balaguer to shore up the country's faltering economy.
   Juan Jose Arteaga, presidential economic adviser, said today the
strike would have no effect on the government's economic policies.
The program includes sharp increases in the costs of basic consumer
goods. The price of gasoline, for example, rose 83.6 percent from
55 cents to $1.07 a gallon.
   The conservative Balaguer, 83 and blind, is to be inaugurated
Thursday to a second consecutive four-year term. He narrowly
defeated his longtime challenger, leftist Juan Bosch, in a disputed
election May 16.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ordered the restoration
of citizenship to a large number of exiles, and an official
suggested that Nobel laureates Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Joseph
Brodsky may be among them.
   The Soviet president ``canceled the decrees on citizenship
concerning a number of persons who are now living abroad,'' the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported, citing an official
announcement.
   The decree came two days after Gorbachev issued a sweeping
decree restoring the rights of all victims of Stalin's repressions,
saying thousands of innocent people still bore ``a stain of
injustice.''
   The brief report on today's order said it dealt with
``injustices that occurred between 1966 and 1988,'' but did not say
if it affected everyone whose citizenship was revoked during that
period. Nor did it name anyone in particular.
   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the
order ``concerns a rather large number of people. Some names were
mentioned _ Brodsky, Solzhenitsyn.''
   ``I just heard that ostensibly Mr. Solzhenitsyn got back his
Soviet citizenship, but I don't know for sure,'' Gremitskikh said.
   The government of former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev revoked
the citizenship of prominent authors and performing artists who
spoke out against repression in their homeland.
   But Gorbachev's government has restored the citizenship of a
number of them, notably cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich
and his wife, singer Galina Vishnevskaya.
   Gremitskikh was unable to say whether the presidential order
also applies to Jews who emigrated to Israel and were deprived of
their citizenship.
   Both Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky spent time in Soviet prison camps
for their political views.
   Solzhenitsyn is the author of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which
depicted the horrors of dictator Josef Stalin's prison camps. The
author was charged with high treason in 1974, stripped of his
citizenship and expelled from the country. He now lives in Vermont.
   Other well-known works by Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize
in literature in 1970, include ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich'' and ``Cancer Ward.'' The Soviet Union banned his books
for decades but in the past year has published several of them,
including ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   Solzhenitsyn came under particular criticism in his homeland
because he has condemned not only Stalin but also Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, calling him ``evil.'' Lenin is still generally
revered in the Soviet Union.
   Solzhenitsyn has said he would not return to the Soviet Union
unless all of his books were published and widely available. A
number of his books have been printed, but almost none can readily
be found in the shortage-plagued Soviet Union.
   Brodsky is a poet and essayist who now lives in New York. Only a
few of his works were published in the Soviet Union until the
literary monthly Novy Mir printed a selection after he won the 1987
Nobel Prize for Literature.
   He was sentenced to five years in an Arctic labor camp in 1964
after being convicted of ``parasitism,'' but released after 18
months. Parasitism was the crime of not holding a job. Many
dissidents were fired, barred from working and then found guilty of
parasitism.
   Brodsky left the Soviet Union in 1972 after being told by secret
police to emigrate or ``face the consequences.'' He understood the
threat to mean that he might face another prison term if he stayed.
   He left behind an eloquent appeal to Brezhnev that he be
permitted to return home one day.
   ``Although I am losing my Soviet citizenship, I do not cease to
be a Russian poet. I belong to Russian culture, I feel part of
it,'' he said.
   ``I feel bitter as I leave Russia, I was born, raised and have
lived here and I owe everything I have in the world to Russia.
Everything bad I have suffered has been more than compensated by
the good, and I have never felt that I have been hurt by my
homeland.''
   In an interview in Paris with the reporters from the Soviet
newspaper Izvestia in 1988, Brodsky said he might be interested in
returning to Leningrad for a private visit.
   Moscow News said today that a book of Brodsky's poetry is being
published for the first time in the Soviet Union. The Northwest
publishing house in Leningrad plans 100,000 copies of the book,
``The Autumn Cry of the Hawk.''

   A television monitor shows the destruction
of one of the world's most loathed weapons _ a rocket armed with
deadly nerve agent being cut by a machine and dumped into an
incinerator.
   It was the 63rd M-55 rocket destroyed Tuesday at this remote
outpost 800 miles southwest of Honolulu and the 1,104th incinerated
since the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System or JACADS
plant began tests June 30.
   ``I came here with a few doubts, but I leave here reinforced in
my support for this facility,'' Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said
after seeing the process.
   He and several other visitors wore gas masks and nerve gas
antidote syringes strapped to their sides.
   The $240 million facility was built to destroy 300,000 aging
chemical weapons moved here from Okinawa in 1971. Pending
government approval and the outcome of a lawsuit filed by the
environmental group Greenpeace USA, the facility also will
incinerate 100,000 rounds being shipped from West Germany.
   Some Pacific leaders and environmental groups fear the facility
is unsafe and could turn Johnston Atoll into the nation's _ and
perhaps the world's _ chemical munitions disposal site.
   To address those fears, Inouye traveled to the small, flat atoll
on Tuesday with congressional delegates Ben Blaz, R-Guam, and Eni
Faleomavaega, D-American Samoa, Pacific forces commander Adm.
Huntington Hardisty and several reporters.
   An Army spokesman said it was the first time reporters had been
given access to the atoll's chemical weapons facilities.
   Inouye, chairman of the Senate defense appropriations
subcommittee, said he arranged the tour because a lack of
information about activities at Johnston Atoll was causing
unfounded concern.
   Inouye said he came away convinced the facility was safe, would
not harm the environment and would not be used for weapons stored
on the U.S. mainland.
   ``My reaction is very good,'' Blaz said. ``I am absolutely
convinced this facility is as good as it can be to do the job for
which it is intended.''
   Col. David Moss, in charge of JACADS, told the visitors the
facility is safe.
   ``We take all the precautions we possibly can. We do extensive
monitoring. We've destroyed over 1,100 rockets already without
incident,'' Moss said.
   Similar plants are planned for the mainland, where nearly all of
the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile is kept. The Johnston Atoll and
European weapons amount to 6.6 percent of the U.S. chemical
munitions arsenal.
   The disposal facility, which resembles a factory or power plant,
covers several acres on the coral atoll that is barely large enough
to accommodate its airport.
   The facility is being tested in a 16-month trial run, burning
obsolete rockets containing the nerve agent GB, which kills by
paralyzing the respiratory system.
   Greenpeace sued to block the shipment of weapons from West
Germany to Johnston Atoll. A federal judge in Honolulu will
consider the group's request for a preliminary injunction to halt
the shipment at an Aug. 20 hearing.
   Greenpeace claims the Army's environmental impact statements for
the incinerator are not comprehensive and fail to address
alternatives to incineration.
   Two ships that will carry the weapons to the Pacific are not
scheduled to leave West Germany until next month.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's top political party relieved
its general secretary of his duties today after a news magazine
said he had worked for the former Communist secret police for 15
years.
   Martin Kirchner, chief of the Christian Democratic Union of
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, was told to step aside pending
an investigation of the accusations, said party deputy chairman
Horst Korbella.
   Kirchner was pushed aside shortly after the West German magazine
Stern reported in its latest edition that he worked for the
notorious secret police as a paid informant for 15 years.
   Stern, which cited as sources three former secret police
members, said Kirchner was working for the intelligence network
when he met last year with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
other West German officials.
   Kirchner was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.
He has denied previous reports in the press that he had ties to the
secret police, known as the Stasi.
   The Stern report is the latest of several accusations that
prominent people in East Germany's new democratic system were
informers for the once-feared domestic intelligence network.
   In recent months, there also have been widespread reports that
the Stasi harbored notorious leftist terrorists and may have
plotted and carried out the assassinations of dissidents and
refugees.
   Considered one of the most skilled intelligence services in the
world, the omnipresent Stasi created an atmosphere of fear and
intimidation that helped keep in power the government of former
hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker. Honecker was ousted in
the fall by a popular pro-democracy uprising.
   The Stern report said Kirchner reported to the Stasi details of
a meeting with Kohl and other West German officials during the
waning days of the former government.
   Kohl's West German Christian Democrats helped turn the East
German Christian Democratic Union from a Communist-linked puppet
party into a sister party that will soon merge with its West German
counterpart.
   The Stern report said Kirchner supplied information from the
meeting with Kohl to the Stasi so it could prepare for the days
following Honecker's fall.
   The Christian Democrats won the most votes in East Germany's
first free elections on March 18 by promising to seek quick unity
with West Germany.
   De Maiziere has denied accusations that he also supplied
information to the secret police.
   Stern said Kirchner was paid monthly by the Stasi and worked as
an informant for the agency until a few days before the opening of
the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.
   Stern said two of the three former Stasi members it quoted were
Kirchner's bosses during his relationship with the secret police
between 1978 and 1989.
   The Stasi had more than 80,000 members but was believed to have
had even more people working with it on a regular basis. This group
included educators, scientists and numerous other people.
   East Germans are torn between seeking retribution and
prosecuting former Stasi agents and informants or granting a
general amnesty.

   ABC anchor Ted Koppel, planning a second day of
reports from Iraq today, says Jordan's King Hussein may have helped
get him there in hope of airing the Iraqi point of view.
   The ``Nightline'' anchor scored a journalistic coup Tuesday when
he became the first American reporter let into Iraq since that
country's takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Today, CBS anchorman Dan Rather and a CBS team that included
correspondent Allen Pizzey also were allowed in, a CBS spokeswoman
said. NBC and Cable News Network still were trying to arrange
similar trips.
   Koppel, in a phone report from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to
his ``Nightline'' program Tuesday night, said he'd spent 2{ hours
with King Hussein several days ago.
   He said the king, an ally of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, ``is
extremely eager to have the Iraqi point of view communicated
through the American media....''
   The king, he added, ``was very helpful, I think, in making our
trip possible.''
   He speculated that Iraqi officials let him in because they feel
things are going so poorly for them that ``they have nothing to
lose by letting us come over here and report from here.
   ``Because the reporting has been all so anti-Iraq that I guess
they feel it can't get much worse. And who knows? Some of their
point of view might get across.''
   Koppel, whose Emmy-winning series is known for offering
interviews with heads of state who engage in what some call
television diplomacy, flew to Iraq from Jordan late Tuesday.
   The ABC crew with him included morning news anchor Forrest
Sawyer, who reported from Bagdhad today on ``Good Morning America.''
   But Koppel was unable then to interview the country's leader,
and his ABC crew him was unable to arrange a satellite video hookup
from the state-run television facilities in Baghdad.
   So, as Sawyer did today, Koppel phoned in his reports to ABC's
``World News Tonight'' and then ``Nightline,'' the latter anchored
in New York by Chris Wallace.
   Koppel also included on his late-night broadcast an interview
with Bob Vinton, whom he identified as a U.S. businessman who has
lived in Iraq since last fall. Vinton works for Johnson Controls
Inc., a Milwaukee-based company that makes automotive batteries and
building instrumentation.
   Vinton said Iraqis continued to treat Americans in Baghdad
courteously and that ``we have complete freedom of movement.''
   But he said there had been ``no indications'' that Americans in
Iraq ``can go home at any time'' during the current crisis, and he
expressed surprise Koppel was allowed in the country.
   Koppel said on the air that Iraqi leaders had been trying to get
news of U.S. moves and glean U.S. intentions from the global
broadcasts of Cable News Network received in Baghdad.
   NBC, seeking entry into Iraq for ``Sunday Today'' co-anchor
Garrick Utley and correspondent Rick Davis, has had difficulty
getting visas due to communications problems between Iraqi
officials in Jordon and Baghdad, said NBC News foreign editor David
Miller.
   ``But we're hopeful,'' he said.

   Pro-choice activists burned mock baptismal
certificates and declared themselves ``voluntarily excommunicated''
to protest an anti-abortion campaign developed for the Roman
Catholic Church.
   ``I'd certainly like to be excommunicated if that's what they
are doing to people who support abortions,'' said Alison Gude, 28,
who was baptized in the Catholic church.
   Gude was one of 20 protesters who gathered Tuesday outside the
Cathedral Hill Hotel where 200 Catholic officials and laymen got
their first glimpse of the campaign put together by the public
relations firm Hill and Knowlton.
   ``We're here to let them know the majority of people in this
country are pro-choice and no slick advertising campaign is going
to deter women from seeking abortions,'' said Marianne Jensen, a
spokeswoman for the Bay Area Coalition Against Operation Rescue,
which organized the protests.
   Some church officials have termed the campaign as informational
rather than advertising.
   The protesters chanted slogans such as ``Keep Your Rosaries Out
Of Our Ovaries'' as they gathered around a skeleton draped in red
robes which they said represented Cardinal John O'Connor.
   O'Connor, the archbishop of New York and chairman of the
Bishop's Committee for Pro-Life Activities, addressed the diocesan
pro-life coordinators Monday during the first day of the two-day
conference.
   Protesters said the church intended to spend $5 million on the
Hill and Knowlton campaign. Church officials have not released the
project's cost, but said $3 million in private donations has been
earmarked for the project.
   ``We think their money would be better spent on Social Services
programs,'' Jensen said.
   ``The point is to get professional assistance on how to better
communicate our message so it will be heard,'' said the Rev. John
Goudrick, executive director for the Secretariat for Pro-Life
Activities. ``I don't think it's being heard because I rarely see
reference to the unborn.''
   Goudrick said the abortion debate instead centers on the
conflict between women and government.
   ``We're focusing on the fact that right now respect for human
life in this country is eroding,'' Goudrick said.
   Goudrick said the campaign would not target just a Catholic
audience.
   ``Human life is a human issue. It's not just a Catholic issue,''
he said.

<HEAD>Americans Closely Following Gulf Crisis, Survey Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two out of three Americans say they are
following the action in the Persian Gulf very closely and 85
percent of those polled say it is the most important news of the
month, a media organization reported today.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press said the
level of interest was significantly higher than for news of
previous actions involving U.S. armed forces.
   For example, 60 percent said they paid very close attention to
the December invasion of Panama and 58 percent to the U.S. air
strikes against Libya in 1986, compared with the 66 percent for the
Gulf developments.
   Times Mirror said it was unprecedented to have 85 percent
responding that the Gulf action was the most important story. The
previous high was 56 percent for the invasion of Panama.
   The center is an arm of Times Mirror, which publishes a number
of newspapers and has other news media interests. The center makes
monthly surveys of public interest in the news.
   It said the public was reasonably well informed about the Gulf
crisis, with 66 percent knowing that the Soviet Union is supporting
U.S. efforts to get Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Almost as many,
64 percent, knew that other countries were sending forces to Saudi
Arabia to defend against an Iraqi invasion.
   The organization surveyed 1,213 adults by telephone from Aug.
9-12. The error attributable to sampling and other random effects
is plus or minus 3 percentage points, the center said.
   The center also said that 30 percent of the public, an unusually
large proportion, said they had followed news about the condition
of the economy closely during the previous four weeks. In May, only
18 percent said they were paying close attention to news about
increasing interest rates and higher inflation.
   Still, however, just as was the case in June, only 18 percent
claimed to be closely following stories about the efforts of the
administration and Congress to cut the budget deficit.

<TEXT>
   The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and
seven other ships left East Coast ports this morning on their way
to join the growing U.S. military presence in the Middle East.
   Leaving from Norfolk were the Kennedy; the guided missile
cruisers USS Mississippi, USS San Jacinto, and USS Thomas S. Gates;
and the combat stores ship USS Sylvania.
   The destroyer USS Moosbrugger from Charleston, S.C., the guided
missile frigate USS Roberts from Newport, R.I., and the fast combat
support ship USS Seattle from Earle, N.J., will join the carrier
group at sea, said Lt. Cmdr. Carrie Hartshorne, an Atlantic Fleet
spokeswoman.
   ``The Kennedy battle group will be available for potential
relief of the Eisenhower battle group or additional tasking to be
determined by rapidly changing events,'' said Ms. Hartshorne. The
Eisenhower battle group has been in the Mediterranean for several
months.
   About 150 family members and friends gathered at the Norfolk
Naval Station as the Kennedy departed with its crew lining the
rails.
   ``I really don't want him to go,'' said 15-year-old Trevor,
whose father is a petty officer aboard the aircraft carrier. The
Navy requested that the last names of family members not be used.
``He told me what was happening and explained why he had to go,''
the boy said.
   Tuesday, the Navy hospital ship USS Comfort and two amphibious
vessels set out from Norfolk.
   The 1,000-bed Comfort left on a direct route to the Middle East,
but the amphibious vessels, the USS Portland and the USS Trenton,
headed for Morehead City, N.C., to pick up troops en route to their
deployment.
   The carrier battle group will carry about 9,000 sailors and
Marines, the spokeswoman said.
   Activated Monday for duty in the Middle East was the Cape
Mohican, a freighter from the James River Reserve Fleet. It is the
sixth ship called to duty from the approximately 100 at anchor in
the James River off Fort Eustis, said Anthony A. Schiavone, the
James River Fleet superintendent. He said the ship should be ready
to go by the end of the week.
   The ship can carry 36 barges that are 95 feet long and 35 feet
wide, said William S. Chambers, Maritime Administration director
for the South Atlantic region. The Maritime Administration operates
the fleet.
   The Cape Mohican also can carry Army landing craft and small
cargo boats, Schiavone said.
   The Roberts weathered a previous Middle East crisis. On April
14, 1988, it hit an Iranian mine while escorting a Kuwaiti-flagged
oil tanker during the Iran-Iraq war.
   The blast tore a 22- to 25-foot hole in its bottom, flooded its
engine room and set off a fire that took five hours to control. Ten
crewmen were injured, and have since recovered.

   Rebel fighters escorted staff and
refugees living in the West German, Moroccan and Egyptian embassies
from the battle front of Monrovia today but refused to let Guineans
evacuate their mission.
   The rebels of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front have
accused Guinea of supporting Liberian President Samuel Doe with
troops.
   Taylor's rebels escorted 11 Germans, two Moroccan diplomats, the
Egyptian ambassador, 4 Lebanese and 24 Liberians in an 18-vehicle
convoy headed for neighboring Ivory Coast, West German Ambassador
Juergen Gehl told reporters as he departed.
   It would take at least 12 hours to reach the northeastern
border, traveling through rebel-held territory.
   About 60 Guineans, including the ambassador, were not allowed to
join the convoy, Gehl said.
   Rebels attacked the embassies of Guinea and Nigeria last week,
forcing more than 8,000 people sheltered there into the streets,
where the rebels were battling Doe's troops with rockets,
anti-aircraft guns and assault rifles.
   People at Guinea's mission made their way back to the building
rather than risk passing through numerous rebel check points
blocking the route to the border.
   Many of those chased from the embassy were Mandingos, a tribe
rebels accuse of supporting Doe's government. People suspected of
aiding Doe risk summary execution.
   Taylor's forces have captured at least four Guinean soldiers
accused of fighting with Doe's troops. But one of the prisoners
told reporters he was guarding the embassy when he was taken.
   An estimated 1,400 people are still sheltered at the Nigerian
Embassy, next to the West German compound.
   In the past, Taylor has said he would allow the Nigerian and
Guinean embassies to evacuate their personnel.
   But that was before both countries announced they were sending
troops to a six-nation West African task force mobilizing in
neighboring Sierra Leone. The force has orders to sail to Monrovia
and force a halt to the nearly 8-month-old civil war.
   The West African nations sending troops are Ghana, Gambia,
Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo.
   Rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. In February, rebel
commander Prince Johnson split with Taylor and formed a rival
faction that is fighting Doe's soldiers in central Monrovia and
fending off attacks from Taylor's forces.
   On Tuesday, Taylor said his rebels had killed Johnson in an
ambush, but reporters later interviewed Taylor's rival, who laughed
at the claim.
   Doe and Johnson have welcomed the West African intervention.
   The intra-rebel fighting has prolonged the rebellion in which
5,000 people have been killed, mostly civilians.
   More than 100 people, including 52 West Germans, 28 Spaniards,
five Swiss, four Filipinos and two American citizens were evacuated
Sunday by U.S. Marines in helicopters from the Atlantic Ocean port
of Buchanan, 90 miles east of Monrovia. They had traveled by convoy
from Congo Town, about a mile outside Monrovia, through rebel-held
territory.
   About 2,000 U.S. Marines in ships off the Liberian coast are on
standby to protect U.S. citizens and installations or are in
Monrovia guarding the U.S. Embassy.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Blocks Release of Counselor's Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taped conversations between a psychotherapist
and two brothers accused in the shotgun slayings of their wealthy
parents can't be released, a state appeals court said in a
temporary ruling.
   The court blocked release of tapes confiscated in connection
with the arrests of Erik and Lyle Menendez. The brothers are
accused in the Aug. 20, 1989, murders of their father, Jose
Menendez, and his wife, Kitty, inside their Beverly Hills mansion.
   Prosecutors allege the sons were motivated by the prospect of a
$14 million inheritance.
   The 2nd District Court of Appeal issued the emergency stay
Tuesday and set Aug. 24 for the prosecutors' rebuttal, said clerk
John Lepo.
   The recordings are of counseling sessions between the brothers
and their psychotherapist, L. Jerome Oziel. Prosecutors, who
already have listened to the tapes, consider them key evidence.
   Defense attorneys claim the tapes fall under doctor-patient
privilege and thus cannot be introduced as evidence.
   ``We're delighted by the ruling,'' said defense attorney Gerald
Chaleff.
   Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James Albracht ruled Aug. 6
that the privilege protection did not apply because Oziel was
threatened.
   Communication between a therapist and patient is considered
confidential unless it involves threats or has been disclosed to a
third party.
   Albracht said Oziel believed the brothers made threats during
the sessions and it was necessary to disclose the conversations to
protect himself and others.
   In another development, Erik, 19, has refused to give
authorities a handwriting sample. Beverly Hills Municipal Judge
Charles Rubin warned him Monday that his refusal can be used as
evidence.
   Prosecutors want to compare the brothers' handwriting to that
found on records used to buy two shotguns in San Diego.
   A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Oct. 22.

<TEXT>
   A conservationist vessel deliberately rammed two
Japanese fishing boats in the North Pacific, disabling equipment
used to recover driftnets, a crew member reported.
   The action was part of a campaign to document and halt the
incidental deaths of millions of seabirds, marine mammals and sea
turtles from driftnetting, said Chris Keyser in a marine satellite
telephone call Tuesday to The Associated Press.
   The Sea Shepherd II, operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society, came upon the six-boat Japanese squid fleet Monday about
1,500 miles north of Honolulu, said Keyser, a free-lance writer
aboard the British-registered, 196-foot North Sea trawler.
   ``It was necessary to disable their fishing gear in order to put
them out of operation,'' said Paul Watson, the skipper of the Sea
Shepherd II and founder of the radical conservation group.
   ``It was also necessary to create an international incident to
focus international attention on the issue,'' he said.
   The Japanese driftnetters are in violation of the North Pacific
treaty on the protection of migratory seabirds, which was signed by
the Japanese government, Watson said.
   But he contended that U.S. and Japanese authorities for the past
decade have done nothing to enforce the treaty, which protects 22
species of sea birds, 13 of which are threatened or endangered.
   ``We're fed up with people just talking about it. It's about
time someone did something to get these pirates out of here,'' said
Watson, who charged that the North Pacific area has become ``a
biological wasteland'' because of the driftnetters.
   ``Any consequences are worth the action we took. The Sea
Shepherd Society has always taken responsibility for its actions
and (we) have never committed a criminal act nor caused any
injuries,'' he said.
   There were no injuries, although two of the Japanese fishermen
threw knives at the Sea Shepherd II after the ramming, Keyser said.
   The Coast Guard had not received any reports of the ramming, but
will be looking into the matter to see if any U.S. citizens were
involved, said Lt. Michael Mohn at the Joint Rescue Coordination
Center.
   Keyser identified the Japanese vessels as the Shunyo Maru and
Ryoun Maru.
   After sideswiping the two boats, the Sea Shepherd II went after
two more boats, but they were faster and were able to escape,
Keyser said.
   There has been a growing movement throughout the Pacific to ban
the nearly invisible driftnets, known by critics as ``walls of
death,'' which can stretch for 30 miles trapping a wide variety of
marine life and birds as well as large schools of squid for which
they were developed.
   Watson was one of the original founders of the conservation
group Greenpeace before breaking ties to found the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society, now said to have 15,000 members worldwide.
   The 23 crew members of the Sea Shepherd II include citizens of
the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Spain and the
Philippines, Watson said.

   The death toll in four days of
black factional fighting soared to at least 99 today after armed
bands attacked shantytowns east of Johannesburg, hacking people to
death with axes and spears.
   The Star newspaper put the death toll at 105, but police
officials said they could confirm only 99 killings since fighting
began Sunday. At least 90 of the deaths came Tuesday night and
today, police said.
   ``We just keep on finding bodies,'' a spokesman said. He spoke
on condition of anonymity. Police said they expected the death toll
to climb.
   Long columns of police armored vehicles and trucks filled with
police armed with assault rifles and shotguns roamed through the
townships today in a huge show of force. Many areas in Tokoza and
Katlehong townships were quiet, but police and residents feared
violence would begin again tonight.
   Police were seen today loading more than 40 bodies onto trucks
in various places.
   The fighting pits Xhosa people of the African National Congress
against the conservative Zulu Inkatha movement. The ANC and Inkatha
oppose apartheid, but they are divided by leadership disputes,
tribal divisions and their visions of a future South Africa.
   The fighting is the biggest single outbreak of township violence
in recent years, the independent South African Press Association
reported.
   Armed bands of Zulus attacked several shantytowns Tuesday night
and again today. They set fire to houses and attacked fleeing
residents with spears, pangas _ a machette-like weapon _ knives and
other weapons.
   An armed Xhosa-speaking man with blood covering his shirt told a
local journalist his group had just killed ``eight Inkatha'' and
had suffered two losses.
   State-run South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said about 90
people had been treated for injuries at the Natalspruit Hospital.
   A police spokesman, Capt. Eugue Opperman, said a policeman
sustained shrapnel wounds today after a hand grenade was hurled at
police by an unidentified man. He said police had been fired at on
several occasions.
   Police used tear gas today to drive back several hundred armed
Inkatha supporters as they moved toward a shantytown at Katlehong
that had been attacked during the night, witnesses said. Police
also fired several gun shots.
   Police seized hundreds of knives, spears and other weapons and
reported finding a chest containing Soviet-designed AK-47 assault
rifles and grenades. A large police truck piled high with
confiscated weapons was seen leaving Katlehong.
   More than 5,000 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting between
Inkatha and ANC supporters in Natal, but only in recent weeks has
the factional fighting begun to spill over into the Johannesburg
area.

<TEXT>
   California's ban on political party
endorsements in elections of judges and local government officials
is unconstitutional because if violates freedom of speech, a
federal appeals court has ruled.
   The 8-3 ruling of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the
second blow in two years to state laws restricting party
endorsements. Last year the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a
California law that prohibited parties from endorsing candidates in
their own partisan primaries.
   ``This decision constitutes a charter of freedom for political
parties,'' state Democratic Chairman Edmund Brown Jr., the former
governor, said in a statement after Tuesday's ruling. ``Lobbyists
and special interest groups have enjoyed a free hand, while
official political parties have been left out of local government.''
   Deputy City Attorney Burk Delventhal of San Francisco, whose
office defended the state law, said the ruling could be damaging to
local government and judicial independence if it led to widespread
party endorsements in nonpartisan elections.
   ``It would deprive local governments of the opportunity to have
people with independent points of view who do not necessarily have
to toe the party line to gain access to the public,'' Delventhal
said. He said no decision has been made on an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   The ban on endorsements in nonpartisan local government, school
board and judicial elections was added to the state Constitution by
the voters in 1986 after the state Supreme Court had ruled that the
endorsements were not prohibited by law.
   Sponsors of the 1986 measure claimed roots in the reforms of the
1910s that sought to break the grip of big-money interests by
weakening political parties. One of the reforms was to make all
local government offices nonpartisan.
   The measure was immediately challenged by a diverse group of San
Francisco political activists, backed later by the state Democratic
Party. U.S. District Judge Alfonso Zirpoli ruled in their favor; a
three-judge appellate panel overturned his decision, saying the law
was needed to protect nonpartisan elections, but the larger panel
on Tuesday reinstated Zirpoli's ruling.
   Chief Judge Alfred Goodwin, in the majority opinion, said
parties and their members have rights of free speech and
association that cannot be completely suppressed without a
compelling reason. He said nonpartisan elections had been
adequately protected by keeping the parties out of the nomination
process and restricting the candidates' partisan activities.
   In a separate concurring opinion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt,
joined by Judge Alex Kozinski, said the integrity of the political
process is threatened not by parties, but by ``the corrupting
influence of money in politics.''
   Keeping parties weak does not prevent corruption and may even
encourage it, Reinhardt wrote; office-holders and candidates ``must
go directly to the big monied interests and beg for the funds
necessary to finance their campaigns.''
   He also said that as long as California elects its judges, it
must leave the voters ``free, rightly or wrongly, to consider the
political philosophy of the candidates.'' Banning party
endorsements merely leaves the field free to special interests,
Reinhardt said.
   Dissenting Judge Arthur Alarcon said a party endorsement in a
judicial race might be tempting to ``a frightened incumbent who has
been subjected to media criticism for an unpopular decision,''
Alarcon said.
   Judge Pamela Rymer, in a separate dissent joined by Alarcon and
Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, said allowing party endorsements ``would
effectively destroy the nonpartisan system.''

   A state agency today put nine homes
up for sale near the Love Canal chemical dump and said the
neighborhood bought up by the government in the 1970s is safe, but
with no guarantees.
   The homes have been rigorously tested and are as safe as any in
Niagara Falls, said William L. Broderick, executive director of the
Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency.
   But he said it was impossible to guarantee that the toxic
chemical leaks that once drove 2,500 people from the neighborhood
would not recur.
   ``There's no written guarantees going to be given,'' Broderick
said at a news conference at his agency's offices about 500 feet
from the site of the toxic dump. ``All we have is the written
assurance of the state Health Department and the state
environmental department as to the maintenance of the canal.
   ``If there is a problem in the future, I'm sure the state will
come back and do as they did last time.''
   The agency originally planned to offer 10 homes today, but
Broderick said a resident of the neighborhood already had offered
to buy one.
   Eight years ago, the idea that anyone would want to move back to
Love Canal was so preposterous that it became a joke in the movie
``Tootsie.''
   James E. Carr, the agency's planning director, said tours of the
homes will be given for the next 20 days to interested buyers. The
agency plans to start accepting offers Sept. 5.
   Broderick said a flurry of last-minute court action on Tuesday
would not prevent the agency from going ahead with plans to sell
some Love Canal homes.
   More than 200 people, including several former residents, have
expressed interest in the small, single-family homes. Asking prices
of $40,000 to $60,000 _ about 20 percent less than comparable homes
elsewhere _ have stimulated interest.
   Many prospective buyers say they believe the danger from the
22,000 tons of chemicals still buried there has been overstated.
   ``The canal went right through my back yard. As kids, we used to
go back in those fields, mow them down, play baseball,'' said Gail
McClinsey. ``I'm fine, and I have two children. They're fine. I
keep in touch with some of the friends I grew up with. They're
fine.''
   But doubts remain about allowing people to move into homes just
a few blocks from the canal bed where Hooker Chemical Co. dumped
dioxin, PCBs and other toxic chemicals in the 1940s and 1950s.
   Leaks discovered in the late 1970s led 2,500 residents to
abandon their homes, making Love Canal a national symbol of the
threat posed by toxic waste. In ``Tootsie,'' Dustin Hoffman's
character considers taking a part in a play called ``Return to Love
Canal.''
   Carr said the area containing the 10 homes is safe even though
most of the chemicals dumped in the canal have not been removed.
``They do testing all the time. There's continual monitoring going
on,'' he said. ``Sure, I'd live there.''
   Richard J. Lippes, a lawyer for environmental and community
groups seeking to block resettlement, disagreed.
   ``I would never buy a home in Love Canal. I would never put my
family in such jeopardy,'' he said. ``And if I wouldn't do it,
there is no way I could recommend to anyone else to do it.''
   The groups asked state Supreme Court Justice Joseph Mintz to
enforce his 1985 injunction barring resettlement pending
environmental and livability studies. But the agency urged him to
lift the order, saying the studies have been done.
   The attorney general's office, which originally sought the
injunction, said it would not object. ``We feel that the terms of
the injunction have been met,'' said Leslie Gersing, spokeswoman
for Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   No rulings are expected until Mintz returns from vacation next
month.
   A study completed in 1988 found that the resettlement area north
and northwest of Love Canal, which contains about 250 single-family
homes, was no more contaminated than comparable parts of Niagara
Falls. An area east of the canal containing about 270 homes was
deemed uninhabitable because of contamination.
   Resettlement opponents claim the livability study, and an
environmental review completed this year, are flawed. Among other
things, they say that other areas of Niagara Falls may be polluted
from several chemical plants and other toxic dumps.
   ``They haven't determined that those control areas are safe, and
if those control areas aren't safe, neither is Love Canal,'' Lippes
said.

<HEAD>Ousted Kuwaiti Official Says Iraq Invasion Came Despite
Concessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's takeover of Kuwait came despite the
emirate's concessions on two key Iraqi demands, the foreign
minister of Kuwait's ousted government said in an interview
published today.
   In talks that broke down less than 24 hours before the Aug. 2
invasion, Kuwait had agreed to write off Iraq's war debts and let
Baghdad use a Kuwaiti island for its oil operations, said the
minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber.
   In remarks published in this week's edition of the state-owned
Al-Mussawar magazine, Sheik Sabah said Iraq had demanded the
writeoff of an estimated $14 billion to $15 billion in loans Kuwait
provided Baghdad during its eight-year war with Iran.
   ``Iraq asked us to drop the debts, and we did not object,''
Sabah said.
   He said the questions surrounding Iraq's need of an outlet for
its oil exports had not been completely resolved, but that Kuwait
had done what it could to meet Baghdad's demands.
   He said Iraq had asked for ownership of two strategic Persian
Gulf islands _Bubiyan and Warba _ and that Kuwait had areed to
lease Iraq one of them instead.
   ``Iraq asked for Bubiyan Island,'' he told the magazine. ``We
agreed to give them Warba island instead because Bubiyan is about a
quarter the area of Kuwait and because Warba is enough for Iraq's
purposes.''
   He said Iraq would have been able to use Warba as an outlet to
the gulf for oil from its wells in Rumaila, a rich field in on the
disputed Iraq-Kuwait frontier.
   The former minister said the demand for ownership was refused
because the Kuwaiti Parliament had issued a decree banning the
ceding of any land.
   Iraq stormed out of the meeting in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and the
invasion followed. Afterward, Baghdad contended it invaded at the
request of a new government that had overthrown the old ruling
family. Most diplomats discounted that claim.
   Iraq later announced formation of a new Kuwaiti government, then
declared it had annexed Kuwait.
   The ousted foreign minister said the island question had been an
irritant between Iraq and Kuwait throughout the Iran-Iraq war.
Baghdad repeatedly asked for the use of the two islands; Kuwait
consistently refused.
   In the fortnight before the invasion, Iraq accused Kuwait of
stealing $2.4 billion in oil from the wells near the frontier. It
also charged Kuwait was trying to ruin Baghdad's economy by
producing more than its OPEC quota of oil, pushing down world
market prices.
   At the time of the Jiddah talks, diplomatic sources said the
war-debt problem could be resolved but that Kuwait's refusal to
cede sovereignty over the two islands was a main sticking point.

   East Oregonian, Pendleton, Ore., on rising oil and gasoline
prices:
   It's fascinating to observe that whenever the price of oil and
gasoline skyrockets, some oil company hotshot tells the rest of us
we don't know how markets operate. Maybe fascinating isn't the
word. How about disgusting?
   Recent statements by Charles J. DiBona, president of the
American Petroleum Institute, typify the arrogance and obfuscation
of those who think they know better as they gouge us during times
of crisis. DiBona told the Senate Commerce consumer subcommitee ...
that critics of the recent price increases were taking ``a naive,
one-sided view of how markets work.'' Oil industry representatives
issued similar statements after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Mr. DiBona, we may be naive in the sense that we expect the oil
industry to show a little more restraint (a little more
patriotism?) when our nation faces a tough situation. But we know
how markets work. The big oil companies use any excuse possible to
jack up prices and the American consumers must fork over the dough
if they want to get to work every day and keep American industry
functioning.
   Considering the crisis in the Mideast, it's to be expected that
oil prices would rise. ... But there is a difference between a
legitimate price increase and a gouge. ...
   Taxpayers are spending millions to finance a strong, effective
response to this crisis. At the same time, we are hostage to the
profiteers at home.
   More critical is the possibility that the oil companies' policy
of greed before country is driving America into a recession.
Economic growth has been slow the past few months _ almost stagnant
_ while unemployment and interest rates are rising. Steep energy
prices could plunge us into an economic downturn. ...
   (S)upply isn't the problem. This week an Energy Department
official said U.S. commercial supplies of 392 million barrels are
at the highest level in nine years.

   The Journal, Lorain, Ohio, on rising oil and gasoline prices:
   Political cases are funny in that the final verdict may not
always equal the sum of all the evidence. Such, we suspect, will be
the case in the investigation into the rapid rise in gas prices
allegedly resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   At a House Subcommittee Energy and Power hearing looking into
the rapid rise in gas prices, chairman Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind.,
suggested the cut-off of oil from the Persian Gulf warranted
dipping into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve. That would
reduce consumer prices for gasoline.
   But John Easton of the Energy Department claims those reserves
could only be used to make up for supply shortages, not to bring
down the price of gas.
   But wait a minute. If there isn't a shortage of oil then why is
the price of gas rising so rapidly at the pump? Spokesmen for the
big oil companies, who claim no price gouging is taking place, say
it's because the price of crude oil rose about $7 a barrel (last)
week on the world market. ...
   These contradictions in supply and demand deserve investigation.
But the body doing the investigating is Congress, which has been
stuffing its pockets annually with PAC money from the big oil
companies.
   We'll just bet this probe turns out to be a case where Congress
couldn't hit water if it fell out of a boat.

   The Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   With the array of opposing forces deployed around him, why does
Saddam Hussein persist in his annexation of Kuwait and his threats
to Saudi Arabia? Is his pride so important that he would commit
national suicide rather than back off?
   The situation would be laughable but for the modern-day arms
supplied him by the Soviets and our friends the French. And how can
we laugh when a nation the size of Iraq raises a million-man army
and uses poison gas on its own people?
   Perhaps the ghost of Hitler and the Munich Pact serve us now,
for President Bush said, ``We must resist aggression, ...
appeasement will not work. ... Iraq cannot be allowed to benefit
from its invasion of Kuwait.''
   If all the pressure fails to dissuade Saddam, we will at least
be nipping in the bud a force that is a clear and definite threat
to world peace and the world economy. What we are doing is the best
we can do in a dangerous situation we cannot control, only oppose.

   Los Angeles Times on Japan and the Persian Gulf crisis:
   (Japan) is wholly dependent on foreign oil for all that it does,
and so much of that oil comes from the (Persian) Gulf. .. Japan is
prevented by its constitution _ imposed on it in the settlement of
World War II _ from developing or deploying anything other than a
force for self-defense. ...
   For the Japanese, the best course of action is often the one
that permits it to go quietly about its business. ... But unable to
send troops and in the position of not wishing to alienate its Arab
oil vendors, Japan needs to figure out its best profile in this
crisis.
   Tokyo was right in agreeing to join the embargo early, even
before the key (United Nations) Security Council sanctions vote
..., and now it would be well-advised to assume the role of one of
the anti-Hussein coalition's key underwriters.
   Japan would be a key beneficiary of a more stable gulf region
and would be an even bigger loser than the United States or Britain
if the place goes to pieces. It could offer to help bankroll, for
instance, the cost of any U.N. Security Council peacekeeping effort
if one is established.

<DATELINE>WAYNESBORO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lew DeWitt, the Statler Brothers tenor
and guitarist for more than 18 years, died today at home, his
business manager said. He was 53.
   DeWitt died this morning in his sleep, said Chet Fitzgerald.
DeWitt had suffered from an intestinal disorder for nine years.
   ``He was coherent up until the end. He's been in ill health for
several months,'' Fitzgerald said.
   DeWitt wrote one of the Statlers' biggest hits, ``Flowers on the
Wall,'' in 1965. It sold more than 1 million copies and has been
recorded by about 30 other artists. In those years the group
traveled with country singer Johnny Cash's road show.
   Shortly after leaving the Statlers in 1982, DeWitt resumed his
career on a smaller scale with the Star City Band. He retired again
in November 1989.
   DeWitt, who suffered from regional enteritis, or Crohn's
disease, said life on the road ``was miserable at times.'' At one
point, his weight dropped from 213 pounds to 119 pounds.
   The Statlers were ``kicking around, singing gospel'' when they
met Cash in nearby Roanoke in 1964, DeWitt once recalled. ``He saw
something different in us _ something we could do to make more
money.''
   The Statlers converted to country music, and Cash put the group
in his show.
   ``We had two flop records before we made it big,'' DeWitt said.
``We weren't really big in Columbia Records' eyes until `Flowers on
the Wall.'''
   Over the next two decades, the Statlers became one of the most
widely recognized groups in country music. They won three Grammy
awards and were named top vocal groups nine times by the Country
Music Association.
   DeWitt is survived by his wife, Judy, and four children, and his
mother, Rose.

   A federal appeals court has cleared the way for
the extradition to Israel of a Palestinian-American accused of
taking part in a machine-gun attack on a bus traveling through the
occupied West Bank.
   Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad has been in jail since his arrest three
years ago while lawyers argued over whether he could get a fair
trial in Israel.
   In a unanimous ruling, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected Ahmad's argument that the crime was a political act not
covered by an extradition treaty with Israel.
   Ahmad's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said
today he would seek a stay of extradition while he petitioned the
U.S. Supreme Court to review Ahmad's case.
   If the high court refuses to hear the case, Ahmad could be
extradited, Clark said.
   Ahmad, 37, who Israeli authorities sometimes refer to as Mahmoud
Abed Atta, is charged with taking part in a 1986 attack in which
three Palestine Liberation Organization terrorists hurled Molotov
cocktails and opened fire on a bus carrying Jewish settlers. The
driver was killed and a passenger injured.
   Ahmad left Israel after the attack and was arrested by FBI
agents in 1987 on a flight from Venezuela.
   In hearings last year before U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein, Ahmad argued he would not get a fair trial in Israel and
would be tortured.
   Weinstein ruled in September that Ahmad should be extradited,
saying his offense was not a political crime and that he would
receive just treatment in Israel.
   The appeals court affirmed Weinstein's ruling but criticized him
for holding such long hearings.
   ``The interests of international comity are ill-served by
requiring a foreign nation such as Israel to satisfy a United
States district judge concerning the fairness of its laws and the
manner in which they are enforced,'' Judge Ellsworth H. Van
Graafeiland wrote.
   The U.S. secretary of state has the final decision on whether
extradition should be denied on humanitarian grounds, the court
said.
   Ahmad was born in the West Bank town of Ramalah and became a
U.S. citizen eight years ago.

   The Commericial Dispatch, Columbus, Miss., on David Souter:
   So far, we like what we don't hear about Judge David Souter, the
president's nominee to the Supreme Court. He's a man who minds his
own business and is too immersed in the law to seek the
self-aggrandizing spotlight.
   He sounds like a man who has no use for the trend setters _
preferring to spend his time with the writings of the influential
minds of the ages than with Andy Warhol and his 15-minutes-of-fame
gang. His is an American character and mind we can be proud of.
   There seems little doubt that Souter is a strict
constructionist, not prone to divining implications from the
Constitution.
   We believe Souter will defer to Congress' prerogative of making
the law ... and then test those laws against the immutable
principles of the Constitution.
   The trouble comes when judges circumvent elected
representatives, and thus the people, to decide social policy.
Judge Souter will be a law tester within the context of learning
and constructionism, not a lawmaker. He should be confirmed by the
Senate when hearings start next month.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on the Red Cross:
   The American Red Cross is the nation's largest charity and it
enjoys a high degree of public trust. But ... it (has) found itself
defending its reputation on two fronts.
   The Pittsburgh Press reported on a nine-month investigation of
the Red Cross response to more than 200 disasters. The paper found
that the charity sometimes overstated its response to an emergency,
especially right after a disaster. Sometimes, donated funds didn't
go where contributors thought they were going.
   _Three days after a flood in Alabama, the Red Cross said it had
opened a feeding site in Elba and was distributing hundreds of
cleanup kits. Only one Red Cross worker was in Elba that day, the
Press reported, and she didn't have cleanup kits. The Red Cross
wasn't running a food operation, either; church groups were.
   _A local Red Cross unit raised $1.13 million after a tornado
ripped up an Alabama subdivision. The recovery effort has cost the
Red Cross $400,000 so far. The rest of the money went into the
national disaster fund.
   _Contributors earmarked $40 million to help earthquake victims
in northern California, and found out later that the Red Cross did
not intend to spend that much there. Complaints were so vociferous
that the Red Cross established a new policy; henceforth, funds
contributed to a disaster will be used there.
   _The Red Cross gives the impression that disaster relief is its
main line of work. But only about $100 million _ 9 percent of the
$1.2 billion the Red Cross raised and spent last year _ went for
disaster aid. About $664 million went for blood processing expenses.
   Red Cross blood operations have also come under fire _ serious
when you consider that it supplies half the hospitals in the
country. A Food and Drug Administration investigation showed
weaknesses in Red Cross reporting of accidents and errors in
handling blood. As a result, the charity is reorganizing its system
and has replaced its director of blood services. ...
   The Red Cross will have to work overtime to explain some of
these criticisms to the public on which it depends.

   The Dallas Morning News on foreign investment:
   After decades of deriding the rest of the world for refusing the
benefits of U.S. investment, Americans are growing more fearful of
losing their own economic and political independence to foreign
interests investing in the United States. ...
   Why are Americans so afraid of foreign investment? If investment
is good, what difference does it make where it comes from, as long
as it is not from organized crime? Since Americans have been busy
buying consumer goods and transferring incomes among themselves,
rather than putting money into productive investments, it is nice
someone has considered the United States to be worthy of
investment. ...
   While foreign assets in the United States have increased to $2
trillion, the best guesses are that they amount to only about 1
percent of the nation's total wealth; foreign-owned firms employ
less than 4 percent of the non-bank work force.
   One reason foreigners are transferring their huge dollar
holdings into U.S. assets is that they can get good prices.
Restrict this repatriation of capital ... and the U.S. economy will
lose one of the few energetic factors left in it.
   The United States is not going to provide for its economic
future by halting investment that gives foreigners a stake in
keeping the U.S. economy healthy. The United States will provide
for its future by getting its own house in order.

   Nurses kept hospital patients alive by operating
respirators by hand and a Wall Street firm set up in a hotel
ballroom because of a fire-caused blackout in its third day today
in lower Manhattan.
   The fire Monday at a Consolidated Edison substation trapped
thousands of Wall Street workers in steamy buildings. By Tuesday,
most of the Wall Street area and the American Stock Exchange and
New York commodities markets had reopened.
   But Con Ed said the South Street Seaport, the Fulton Fish Market
and a 1,550-unit high-rise apartment complex could be without power
until Sunday. The utility estimated 1,600 customers were affected.
   About 2,000 utility workers were pulling and splicing cables
today in the 38-block zone surrounding the South Street Seaport
tourist attraction-shopping area, said Con Ed spokeswoman Pat
Richardi.
   ``Things are pretty much the same as they were yesterday,'' she
said.
   Residents and businesses in the area, for the most part, were
showing great forbearance and keeping their spirits up, Ms.
Richardi said. ``I think by and large people have shown a lot of
patience and even good humor.''
   The 300-bed Beekman-Downtown Hospital was without power Tuesday
for about 1{ hours when its emergency generators failed.
   No patients were hurt, but nurses had to operate the respirators
of 14 patients by hand until portable generators provided by Con
Edison and the Fire Department were set up in their rooms, said
nursing director Sandra Sperry.
   The hospital canceled all non-emergency operations.
   The hospital was providing all essential services to its
patients this morning, said spokeswoman Joan Macri. ``Things are
very good now. ... Everybody's spirits are up. Everyone is pitching
in.''
   County Natwest USA shifted 75 people in its equity sales and
trading operations to the Grand Renaissance ballroom at the
Helmsley Palace hotel in midtown Manhattan after it was driven from
its offices on Wall Street.
   Employees of Quick &amp; Reilly Inc. hauled trading and account
records down 14 flights of stairs. The discount brokerage managed
to hook up telephones in its stock clearing firm shortly after the
market opened at 9:30 a.m.
   ``We all came down carrying boxes and bags,'' said Thomas Quick,
the brokerage's president. ``Then it was navigating the crowds on
the streets.''
   At the Fulton Fish Market, Joe Minio, owner of Smitty's Filet
House, said he had bought about $1,000 worth of dry ice to try and
keep his salmon, tuna and swordfish cold. John Flanigan, owner of
Emerald Sea Food, said he could lose 75 percent of his Monday
shipment of fish.
   Con Edison spokesman Bill Murphy said damage was so extensive to
the substation that it was impossible to determine the cause of the
fire.

   Messimvrini, Athens, Greece, on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   One would assume that after 50 years of human progress and the
attempts that have been made to heal the wounds of World War II
there should no longer be any ``madmen'' anywhere who would play
with fire. ...
   And yet, as if there were no Hitler, as if there were no
Mussolini, ... as if there were no merciless war in which rivers of
blood were spilled and the world were divided into two camps, up
comes ... Saddam Hussein _ wanting to follow in the footsteps of
those notable dictators.
   In 1940, though, the free people of the West either did not
notice the danger in time or shrank back when they should have said
the big ``no'' in the way that smaller but brave nations such as
ours did. ... And so those two paranoid ``conquerors of the world''
began the slaughter. ...
   Today, fortunately, things are different. Or appear to be
different. ... (F)ellow Arabs have joined in the Western
multinational force against the Iraqi ``visionary conqueror'' and
herald of the ``holy war'' of hatred. ...
   In this way it is possible that his blackmail will not succeed.
In fact, Saddam Hussein may pass into history as one of the failed
``conquerors'' of humanity, whom no one will remember in a few
years, in far less than 50 years.

   Stampa Sera, Turin, Italy, on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   Saddam Hussein is sufficiently intelligent to know that the
United States cannot impose, even if it wanted to, anything on
Israel. And if ever it wanted to ``convince'' the present rightwing
government of Israel to clear out of the occupied territories, the
U.S. could not do it particularly now when paradoxically, thanks to
Saddam, Israel will recover that role of ``bulwark of the West''
that was weakened as a result of the American-Soviet thawing.
   But to tie a possible withdrawal from Kuwait, obviously in
exchange for some guarantees (that is, money and strategic islands)
to the problematic withdrawl of Israeli forces from the territories
would serve Saddam primarily to save his face, and secondarily to
repropose himself as the ``knight of the Arabs.''

   El Mercurio, Santiago, Chile, on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   Some think that the other oil exporting countries will not be
able to increase their production to fill the vacuum left by the
(United Nations) embargo (on Iraq). That is a reasonable point of
view, although it is also disputable. Those holding that point of
view seem to ignore that strategic reserves of oil exist that will
ensure supplies for a fairly long period of time.
   On the other hand, both Iraq and Kuwait have very large food
deficits. Will the threat of famine make (Sadam) Hussein change his
mind? Or, on the contrary, will it be able to strengthen the unity
of the Arab peoples in an Islamic crusade seeking to do away with
the pro-Western Arab monarchies, Israel and Christians still living
in Lebanon? Should that happen, the answer from the West would be
immediate, violent, paralyzing.

   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, Moscow, on the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   The developments of the recent days _ Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait and worldwide reactions to the act _ have brought into focus
the long-pressing question _ to give a boost to the work of the
Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council. ...
   During the war in Korea, the functions of the direction of armed
forces placed at the disposal of the United Nations by some member
states were transferred, as a result of U.S. political maneuvers,
directly to the General Assembly. The Military Staff Committee
thereby turned into a stillborn agency.
   In the 1970s ... committee sessions were held regularly but they
were a pure formality. ...
   Now that the Cold War has ended, the situation has radically
changed. ... The Soviet Union has reconsidered its attitude toward
many U.N. agencies, including the Military Staff Committee.
   Undoubtedly, conditions are quite ripe to add substance to its
functioning. A solution to problems that have arisen in the Persian
Gulf area could be the first practical step in this respect.
Collective efforts and full use of U.N. mechanisms are the surest
and the most reasonable way to act in such conflict situations. ...
   In the current complex situation in the Middle East, it would be
apparently quite useful to use the potential of the United Nations,
the Security Council and its Military Staff Committee, and not just
the efforts of the United States alone with the involvement of
other countries.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on Pakistan:
   The dismissal of ... Benazir Bhutto as prime minister of
Pakistan answers to a familiar pattern in Pakistani politics. Ever
since its inception in 1947, Pakistan has had problems coming to
terms with democracy. ...
   However, the proper way to deal with weaknesses of the
government would have been to subject it to questioning and
possible defeat on the floor of Parliament, not dismiss it from
above. The presidential action is a problematic one, therefore.
   Ms. Bhutto has alleged that the military, with which she had
growing differences, had a hand in her dismissal. If this is true,
the whole affair would be a reminder of the way the army has
intervened in politics whenever, in its judgment, the politicians
have made a mess of things. ...
   Pakistan has fought, and lost, four wars with India. There are
some who think that army rule contributed to Pakistan's decision to
fight, and that a dilution of military professionalism because of
involvement in politics contributed to its defeat.
   Given that the next war might not remain non-nuclear, regional
stability would dictate that Pakistan make every effort to resolve
its political problems effectively and quickly.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on Marion Barry:
   (Washington Mayor Marion) Barry's case is a striking indictment
of the state of race relations in America.
   A public officer found guilty of an offense which the
administration sees as one of the greatest threats to society
should have resigned immediately. Instead, the mayor basks in the
adulation of his supporters and speaks sentimentally of forgiveness.
   A government which believed in justice would hasten to
strengthen its case. Instead, it appears to be wavering for fear of
a black backlash.
   Such muddled thinking diminishes public respect for the rule of
law and, by encouraging them to see themselves as eternal victims,
does a profound disservice to blacks.
   It is time to recall Martin Luther King's words that a man
should be judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of
his character.

   The city of Potsdam stripped Adolf
Hitler of his honorary citizenship on Wednesday, more than 45 years
after the Nazi dictator's death.
   City councilors in this town outside Berlin were correcting an
embarrassing oversight that was hushed up by the former Communist
regime.
   Potsdam officials also revoked the honorary citizenship for
Hermann Goering, the top Nazi official who directed Hitler's air
war against the Allies.
   Both votes in the 76-member city council were unanimous.
   Potsdam officials made Hitler an honorary citizen in March 1933,
an action that dozens of other German cities also undertook.
   City officials discovered in 1988 that they had not revoked the
honor for Hitler and Goering. They hushed up the oversight to avoid
the wrath of the hard-line Communists.
   Earlier this summer, Potsdam officials admitted their mistake
and promised to take care of the matter.

   Bus and tram drivers in the city of Krasnoyarsk in
eastern Siberia staged a one-day strike Wednesday for higher pay,
affecting thousands of commuters, the Tass news agency reported.
   The transit workers, whose monthly salary averages about $735,
are seeking a 25 percent pay increase, the official news agency
said.
   The City Council agreed to form a commission to deal with the
drivers' demands, and the strike ended at 6 p.m., Tass said.
   The workers went on strike for higher pay, among other issues,
one year ago, Tass said. While many of the other demands have been
satisfied, the wage issue remains outstanding, the news agency said
without elaboration.
   Soviet workers increasingly have been resorting to strikes to
protest their working conditions. Last summer, thousands of coal
miners staged strikes in the Soviet Union to press economic and
political demands.
   Krasnoyarsk, a city of 885,000 people, is 1,920 miles east of
Moscow.

   Seven people fell ill with cholera in southern
Russia along the Don River, apparently from raw sewage that is
flowing into the waterway, a Soviet newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The seven were stricken in the community of Koluzaevo, near the
city of Rostov, about 600 miles south of Moscow, the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda reported.
   About 2.8 million cubic feet of raw sewage are pumped daily into
the Temernik River, a tributary of the Don, causing bacterial
levels to increase up to 100 times more than is permissible, the
newspaper reported.
   One of the victims apparently drank water from the Don, Pravda
said. It did not say how the others were infected.
   Health officials are making house-to-house inquiries to check
people who may have come in contact with those who fell ill, the
newspaper said.
   Fishing and the operation of private boats on the river are
forbidden, Pravda added.

   The Tokyo High Court on Wednesday upheld a
three-year prison term for the owner of a Tokyo hotel that burned
in 1982, killing 32 people.
   Presiding Judge Taro Okubo said the court agreed with the lower
court's 1987 ruling that Hideki Yokoi, owner of the now-closed
Hotel New Japan, was responsible for the failure to improve the
hotel's fire safety measures.
   A pre-dawn blaze destroyed the top two floors of the 10-story
hotel Feb. 8, 1982, killing 32 people.
   Prosecutors argued that the hotel's fire-prevention systems were
inadequate, despite orders from the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Board
for improvements, and said the hotel had failed to install
sprinklers and train employees on how to evacuate guests.
   Yokoi, 77, is being held on $1.7 million bail.
   Lawyers for Yokoi said he has not decided whether to appeal to
the Supreme Court.

   Taiwan's navy acknowledged Wednesday that
one of its patrol boats accidentally slammed into a Chinese boat
filled with people being forced back to China. Twenty-one people on
the Chinese boat drowned.
   Defense Minister Chen Li-an said a court will investigate the
collision and that those responsible will be ``dealt with
severely.''
   The vessel Min Ping Yu No. 5202, carrying 50 illegal Chinese
aliens, was being forced to return to China when the accident
occurred Monday night.
   The navy initially claimed the fishing boat rammed into the
patrol ship.
   The navy rescued 29 Chinese from the high seas. Searchers found
three bodies Wednesday, and 18 other people were missing and
presumed drowned.
   All of those on board the fishing vessel, except the crew, were
locked in a cabin to prevent them from jumping ship and swimming
back to Taiwan. The crew were also Chinese illegal aliens.
   Taiwan has repatriated more than 10,000 mainland Chinese since
1987.
   Last week, China's official Xinhua News Agency claimed Taiwanese
authorities sealed 26 Chinese in the cabin of a fishing boat and
sent them back to China, causing 25 of them to suffocate to death.
   Taiwan denied the report and said mainland Chinese were
repatriated in humane ways.

   Swiss art historian Felix Klee, the son
of artist Paul Klee, is dead at age 82.
   He died Monday, three days before he was to open a commemorative
exhibition of his father's works at the Bern Kunstmuseum, the
museum announced.
   The exhibition is to mark the 50th anniversary of his father's
death. Paul Klee, a German expatriate born in Bern, rose to
prominence in Germany in the 1920s. He returned to Switzerland in
1933 when the Nazis seized power and declared his work degenerate
art.
   Felix Klee, his only son, studied music in Germany and was
drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1944 to serve on the Russian front.
After his release from a Soviet prison camp, Felix Klee moved to
Switzerland where he was naturalized in 1960.
   In 1957 he published the diaries of his father and since 1963,
he headed the Paul Klee-Foundation.

   The army has completed preparations for handing
out gas masks to all Israelis, but Israeli leaders said Wednesday
they were hesitant to give the order because it might create panic
and send a wrong message to Iraq.
   Many Israelis were not waiting for government action. Alarmed by
Iraqi threats to attack Israel with chemical weapons, residents
were buying protective gear from private stores.
   ``By the time the army distributes the gas masks it will be too
late,'' one shopper told the Yediot Ahronot daily Wednesday. The
man bought a gas mask, plastic poncho, rubber boots and gloves at
Amos Gazit Co., a safety equipment store in Tel Aviv.
   In Jerusalem, a store called Safety and Protection tried to lure
shoppers by hanging a white protective suit and gas mask outside
the front door. Boxes of gas masks were piled on the small shop's
floor. Employees refused to discuss business.
   Israeli newspapers have been running full-page articles
explaining what type of gloves, clothing, boots and gas masks are
needed for protection against chemical weapons.
   Israel has long prepared itself for chemical warfare. Students
go through gas attack drills and even the telephone book contains
instructions of what to do in the event of a gas attack.
   Anxiety about an Iraqi attack increased Sunday after Iraqi
President Saddam warned he would attack Israel if the Americans
launched a military strike in the Persian Gulf. Saddam has nerve
gases in his arsenal.
   Israel army radio reported Wednesday that Israel's Civil Defense
had completed preparations for distributing gas masks to all
Israelis, and that it was now up to the government to issue such an
order.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens reportedly is trying to assess
whether mass distribution of gas masks would be perceived by Iraq
as an Israeli preparation for a strike against it.
   Foreign Minister David Levy said that in the current tense
atmosphere, Saddam might use the distribution of gas masks as an
excuse to attack Israel.
   ``It could be interpreted as preparation of an Israeli step, and
this could be used as an alibi by that dictator (Saddam) to do
something,'' Levy told army radio.
   An army source said gas masks could be distributed to all 4.5
million Israelis within four or five days if the government gave
the go-ahead.
   In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, the municipality's Emergency Committee
met with army officials to discuss emergency preparations and said
hundreds of bomb shelters have been checked in recent days.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bert Parks said today that despite ``residual
resentment over the years,'' he reluctantly agreed to appear in the
Miss America Pageant's 70th anniversary show this year.
   Parks was fired in January 1980 after being host of the Miss
America Pageant for 25 years. Then-pageant director Albert Marks
Jr., who died last year, said Parks was too old at age 65 to
continue.
   Parks, now 75, will sing ``There She Is,'' the theme song he
made famous, to a parade of former Miss Americas.
   But the new Miss America still will be serenaded by Gary
Collins, who will remain the pageant co-host with Phyllis George.
   Asked whether he was happy with the arrangement, Parks replied,
``I'm not crazy about that _ no.''
   The decision to have Collins sing was made for ``contractual
reasons. But we'll see about that,'' he said impishly.
   Parks appeared at a news conference with Dorothy Benham, Miss
America 1977, and Leonard Horn, chief executive officer at the Miss
America Organization.
   They symbolically buried a hatchet in a cake that read,
``Welcome back Bert. Miss America Pageant 1990.''
   Horn said Parks would have other, as yet undisclosed, roles in
the show. He said Parks and show officials had not discussed
whether he would be back for more than one year.

<TEXT>
   For more than 20 years Edward W. Gnehm Jr.
toiled the diplomatic ranks on his way to being confirmed as new
ambassador to Kuwait. Then, within hours, Iraq's invading army made
him an envoy without a post.
   Gnehm, a 45-year-old career Foreign Service Officer, was
endorsed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his first
ambassadorship only seven hours before Saddam Hussein's forces
swept into the tiny Persian Gulf sheikdom. The Senate formally
approved him a day after the invasion.
   ``It was fair irony,'' he said in an interview.
   Gnehm had left his post as deputy assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, and was ``in the throes
of packing'' when Iraq's takeover of Kuwait disrupted his travel
schedule.
   Gnehm, a Georgia native known as ``Skip,'' said he and his
family had planned to take a beach vacation last week and then
return to Washington to pack and depart for Kuwait.
   Instead, he has been thrust into the job of director of Task
Force One, a State Department crisis center handling family liaison
and other political, military and consular matters concerning the
Middle East situation.
   Gnehm is also at the Washington end of critical
telecommunication lines with U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad.
   He said he is putting in 16- to 18-hour days and ``it's a big
job. .... We receive thousands of calls a day'' from people with
family or other personal interests in Iraq or Kuwait.
   The outgoing ambassador to Kuwait, Nat Howell, is to remain
indefinitely in Kuwait City. It is not yet clear how the Bush
administration will respond to Iraqi orders for all foreign
diplomats to leave the city by Aug. 24.
   Meanwhile, Gnehm's ambassadorial responsibilities have been
confined to such duties as escorting the foreign minister of
Kuwait's government-in-exile around Washington.
   Gnehm had anticipated that his new posting might be a troubled
one. In July 25 Senate confirmation hearings, he said the State
Department was ``deeply concerned'' about Iraqi troop movements
toward Kuwait. ``They are near the Kuwaiti border. They are
threatening. There is no question about Saddam's intentions.''
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan, at the same hearing, advised Gnehm, ``Do
not hesitate to tell them in Kuwait that they are a very small,
weak country that is very rich. And there are a lot of countries,
other countries, that would like to gobble them up.''
   Gnehm, who speaks Arabic and French, received a master of arts
degree from George Washington University in 1968 and a year later
joined the foreign service as a commercial officer in Saigon,
Vietnam.
   He went on to serve as vice consul in Nepal, economic officer in
Syria, head of the embassy liaison office in Saudi Arabia and
deputy chief of mission in North Yemen.
   He worked as deputy chief of mission in Jordan from 1984 to 1987
before being appointed deputy assistant secretary of defense for
the Near East and South Asia and then moving to his most recent
State Department post last year.
   Gnehm said he was still excited about his first chance to head a
diplomatic mission and hoped he could assume his post soon.
   ``I'm looking forward to a successful term in Kuwait,'' he said,
``once the Iraqis leave.''

   The army defused a 40-pound

   The IRA telephoned a local radio station and said a bomb was on
the line in southern County Armagh, near the Irish border, police
said.
   They said the bomb contained homemade explosives and a timing
device. The railroad, a frequent target of bombs, was closed while
police searched the area.
   In Londonderry, in the northwest of the British-ruled province,
police said they fired a plastic bullet while dispersing youths who
threw 30 gasoline bombs at army patrols. There were no injuries,
they said.
   Army bomb disposal experts were called to defuse bombs planted
on two hijacked vehicles, they added.
   Police said the incidents were believed linked to the 21st
anniversary of the arrival of the British troops on the streets of
Londonderry.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.

   Forest fires this week in California's Yosemite National Park
have cooked up memories of 1988, when flames swept across another
cherished piece of the West: Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   The fires have a lot in common. Both were aggravated by extreme
drought and a decades-long buildup of dry, downed wood. And fires
in both parks are considered natural _ even essential _ ecological
forces.
   But Yosemite officials are glad of one big difference: They have
so far escaped the harsh criticism that Yellowstone's fires focused
on the National Park Service's policy of letting some forest fires
burn.
   During the virtually rainless summer of 1988, fires swept
through nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres. The unusual
drought surprised Yellowstone managers, who clung for weeks to
their standing policy of letting most natural fires burn if no
human lives or property are threatened.
   By mid-July, when officials declared war on all fires within the
park, it was too late. Only the cooler, wetter weather of autumn
stopped the flames.
   The controversy raged even longer, as the Park Service took heat
for what critics called a ``let-it-burn'' policy.
   This past week in Yosemite, fire has charred more than 18,000
acres and caused more than $10 million in property damage. While
small compared to the Yellowstone fires, the fires have been
especially destructive in the popular park, where almost every
feature of the landscape is treasured by visitors.
   Fire destroyed 66 homes in Foresta, a vacation village near the
park. Four other communities were evacuated, and the 759,000-acre
park has been closed to visitors since Friday.
   But criticism of the Park Service has been light.
   Like Yellowstone, Yosemite has a policy of letting
lightning-struck fires burn in some areas. But the fires this
summer are burning in ``suppression areas,'' where fires are fought
automatically because of their proximity to roads or buildings,
said Sue Fritzke, a Yosemite fire official.
   ``There was no question of policy at all,'' she said.
   It also helps that Californians are more accustomed to drought
and wildfire, she said. While Yellowstone's fires were a
hundred-year event, the Yosemite fires are the result of a
four-year statewide drought, and are by no means California's worst
blazes this summer.
   ``California was made to burn,'' Fritzke said. ``People here
understand that fire is a part of the ecosystem.''
   In both parks, officials blamed the intensity of the fires on
100 years of unenlightened management. ``You always thought fires
were bad and you put them out. That was in the days before we
understood the role fire plays in forest ecology,'' said Joan
Anzelmo, a Yellowstone spokeswoman.
   By not allowing periodic, small fires to sweep the forest clear
of fallen dead wood and underbrush, managers set the stage for
huge, destructive fires. That practice changed in the early 1970s,
but there's still a buildup of downed wood and underbrush left over
from earlier days.
   Huge sequoias in Yosemite, for example, have survived 2,000
years of periodic fire and drought. But they are susceptible to
intense crown fires that roar through the canopy of the overgrown
forest, so crews this week sprayed the majestic sequoias with flame
retardant chemicals.
   Normal fire policy is on hold in both parks. In Yosemite,
managers are waiting for more manpower and cooler weather before
resuming theri controlled burns. In Yellowstone, all blazes have
been fought since 1988, pending adoption of a new, stricter fire
management plan due out next year.
   Officials in both parks said fire demonstrates nature's amazing
recuperative ability. After the 1988 fires, Yellowstone researchers
watched in wonder as plants poked up through ash and wildlife
wandered back to begin a new cycle of life.
   In Yosemite this week, the persistence of human nature was also
apparent.
   Doug Martin, a Foresta resident whose home burned down, is
calling neighbors this week to tell them of damage to their homes.
Most of them don't care so much about how the town looks or if it's
safe to return. Martin said their first question is: ``Are we going
to be allowed to rebuild?''

<HEAD>Helms Group Files FEC Complaint Against Gay Boycott</HEAD>

   Supporters of Sen. Jesse Helms have filed a
complaint with the Federal Election Commission over a boycott of
Philip Morris products by gay rights groups.
   The complaint filed by an independent group called Re-Elect
Jesse Helms says homosexual groups are acting as a political action
committee in boycotting Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, both
made by Philip Morris Inc.
   The boycott was called because Philip Morris' political action
committee has contributed to Helms' re-election campaign.
   ``While economic boycotts may be considered lawful as a means of
political protest, (newspaper articles submitted with the
complaint) leave no doubt that the true purpose and intent of
defendants' activities extend beyond acts of protest to the defeat
of Senator Jesse Helms for re-election,'' says the complaint filed
last week.
   Because none of the groups are registered as political
committees, efforts promoting the boycott amount to an improper
spending of funds to influence an election, the complaint alleges.
   The complaint names ACT UP-District of Columbia and ACT UP-San
Francisco, which are AIDS activist groups with gay rights
components; as well as the Dallas Gay Tavern Guild, the Dallas Gay
Alliance and the Tarrant County (Texas) Gay Alliance.
   Kate Raphael, a member of ACT UP-San Francisco who helped
organize the boycotts, said the group was assured by its attorneys
that the boycotts comply with federal elections laws.
   ``We've been assured that what we're doing is most certainly
permissible with the FEC,'' Ms. Raphael said. ``What it does make
clear is that this action is having the desired effect'' by hurting
Helms' campaign.
   Helms angered gay activists this year by criticizing National
Endowment of the Arts grants for a Robert Mapplethorpe photography
exhibit that included photos of homoerotic acts and naked children.
   The exhibit by the late Mapplethorpe led Helms to propose
restrictions on federal support of art deemed obscene or offensive.
   Helms also has been a vocal critic of any federal spending on
AIDS education that might condone or promote homosexuality.
   The FEC complaint is at least the second filed by Helms'
supporters in the past week.
   State GOP chairman Jack Hawke last week filed a complaint with
the commission asking that it investigate any relationship between
the National Abortion Rights Action League and the campaign of
Harvey Gantt, Helms' Democratic opponent in November.
   Hawke questioned an ad by the league that criticized Helms'
opposition to abortion. Hawke asked the FEC to investigate whether
the ad is an independent expenditure or whether it is connected to
the Gantt campaign.
   Gantt campaign manager Mel Watt denied any connection between
the campaign and the ad.

   Two grape growers have been charged with
passing off inexpensive wine grapes as premium varieties.
   Brothers Nick and Frank Bavaro, who own vineyards and a grape
brokerage in Escalon in the San Joaquin Valley, are at the center
of a statewide grape scandal.
   An indictment charged them with conspiracy, mail and wire fraud
and false statements to the United States Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms in connection to the sale of wine grapes to
seven northern California wineries.
   The indictments from a federal grand jury were issued late last
week.
   If convicted of all charges, each faces a maximum of 130 years
in prison and fines up to $6.5 million.
   Lawyers for both brothers declined comment.
   According to the indictment, inexpensive grapes such as
Valdepena and French columbard were sold as expensive Zinfandel,
Chardonnay and other varieties. The Bavaros made $400 to $1,200 per
ton for grapes that usually sell for $100 to $200 per ton.
   The brothers allegedly lied about at least 6,500 tons of wine
grapes valued on the wholesale market at about $4 million.
   Among the wineries that purchased the grapes in question were
the Delicato Vineyards in Manteca, the Lost Hills Winery in Acampo
and the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville.

   Iraq's Saddam Hussein, facing U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi
border, today sought peace on another front by promising to
withdraw from Iranian territory and release soldiers captured
during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Also today, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Washington seeking
to mediate the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush on Tuesday said
the United States may extend its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba to shut off Iraq's last unhindered trade route.
   In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said today it had
sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops to include
Baghdad. Soviet officials also said Soviet women, children and
invalids would be allowed to leave Iraq.
   President Bush today denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of
war,'' and said the United States is ``striking a blow for the
principle that might does not make right.''
   In a speech delivered at the Pentagon, Bush seemed to suggest
that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time.
``No one should doubt our staying power or determination,'' he said.
   The U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continued at fever
pace, with Syrian troops now part of a multinational force camped
out in the desert to guard the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust by
Iraq.
   In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read by a
broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said he will begin
withdrawing troops from Iranian territory on Friday and release
Iranian prisoners of war.
   Iran said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran
to deliver Saddam's message, which it said it would review ``with
optimism.''
   Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had
rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the
eight-year war with Iran.
   The move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with Iran,
which had condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also
criticized the multinational force dispatched to Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam said he sought to ``turn the gulf into a lake of peace
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions
against us.''
   In other developments:
   _The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is
considering urging Bush to order a national callup of armed forces
reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending
soldiers abroad. Bush can call up to 200,000 reservists for up to
180 days without seeking congressional approval.
   _Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said special
ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left Tuesday for consultations with the
governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries.
Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations,
is also expected to visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh said at a regular
news briefing today.
   _The outlook darkened for about 3,000 Americans caught in Iraq
and Kuwait when Saddam sent his forces into the small, oil-rich
sultanate.
   The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said in Athens the Americans and
other stranded foreigners could leave ``as soon as the threats from
the United States and its allies are eliminated.'' ABC quoted an
Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as saying Americans in
Iraq are ``restrictees'' who will stay there until the crisis ends.
   _The Soviet Foreign Ministry said Soviet women, children and
invalids would be permitted to leave Iraq. Spokesman Yuri
Gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling in
Baghdad today, but evacuation plans were hampered by desert heat
and lack of transportation.
   Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of
foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has agreed to allow all
880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but only by a 1,200-mile road route
through Iraq and to the Iraq-Jordan border.
   _The British Foreign Office said today conditions in Kuwait
appear to be deteriorating. There have been reports of wholesale
looting but food and gasoline were still available, said a
spokesman, who by custom was not identified. Banks remained closed.
   _The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said on Tuesday that Iraq
would retaliate against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members
if they boost oil production to fill the gap created by blocked
supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now ``annexed,'' Iraq
has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep rise
in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion.
   The U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ordered a global embargo on
trade with Iraq as punishment for seizing Kuwait. Bush then sent
U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, saying Iraqi troops massed
nearby in Kuwait threatened Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves.
   Twelve Arab League nations voted for an Arab force to protect
Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent arriving
Tuesday, according to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi
capital.
   Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already there.
   The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said today its
troops would join multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of
the contingent was not disclosed.
   Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect shut down Iraq's major oil
outlets through those countries, but according to Jordanian
officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained operating.
   Truckloads of goods rolled into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday and
Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded from ships at the Red Sea port
ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions.
   King Hussein was reportedly carrying a message to Bush from
Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king met Monday. The monarch will meet
Bush on Thursday in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and political
adviser, was asked today about the message the king was said to be
carrying. In an interview from Jordan on ABC, he declined to
discuss details, but said: ``I don't think that his majesty would
be traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not
have a rational approach to the future.''
   A CBS News report citing unidentified Jordanian sources said
that Saddam's message called for an international conference to be
convened to discuss an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. In exchange,
the buildup of U.S. forces in the region would halt. Bush, however,
says he sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the
gulf crisis _ at least until economic sanctions force Saddam to
withdraw his army.
   Bush held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it
cooperates with the trade embargo.
   On Tuesday, the United States and Soviet Union conferred in
Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United
Nations umbrella.
   The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far
to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia
among the other nations lending support at sea.
   The embargo is meant to cripple Iraq by cutting off its exports
of oil and imports of food and military supplies. Iraq imports
about three-quarters of its foodstuffs.
   U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the
Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize
such a naval operation.
   Bush told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade
now in force might be extended to Jordan's Aqaba ``if it is a hole
through which commerce flows'' in and out of Iraq.
   In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of ``Desert Shield,''
the operation designed to confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi
soldiers now in Kuwait. Iraq boasts an army of 1 million members.
At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to be committed to Desert
Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army air assault forces,
paratroopers and infantry.
   Iraq said it invaded Kuwait because of disputes over oil and
money. It accused Kuwait of deliberately slashing Iraqi oil
revenues by overproducing oil and driving down prices, among other
charges.
   Iraq has 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million.

   Two-thirds of Americans surveyed say they're
closely following developments in the Persian Gulf while 85 percent
say the crisis is the most important news of the month, a media
group reported Wednesday.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press said the 66
percent of Americans who say they're closely watching the Persian
Gulf story is the fourth highest level recorded since the surveys
began in 1986.
   The highest percentage was set by the 1986 explosion of the
space shuttle Challenger _ 80 percent. That was followed by last
year's San Francisco earthquake at 73 percent, and the 1987 saga of
Jessica McClure, a toddler who was rescued after falling into a
well near her Texas home at 69 percent.
   The center, an arm of the Times Mirror Co., makes regular
surveys of public interest in news developments.
   The Persian Gulf story was considered the most important story
of August by 85 percent of those surveyed, the center said. The
previous high was set by December's U.S. invasion of Panama,
regarded as the most important story of that month by 56 percent of
those surveyed.
   The surveys also found that 60 percent paid very close attention
to the invasion of Panama and 58 percent to U.S. air strikes
against Libya in 1986.
   The Marine landing in embattled Liberia last week to evacuate
American citizens attracted very close interest among only 27
percent of the public, the center said. Among blacks, the figure
rose to 33 percent. Liberia was founded by freed slaves from
America.
   Nelson Mandela's announcement that the African National Congress
would end its armed struggle with white-ruled South Africa was
followed very closely by 47 percent of black Americans and only 8
percent of white Americans.
   Thirty percent of African-Americans very closely followed the
verdict in the drug trial of Marion Barry, the black mayor of
Washington, D.C., compared with 14 percent of whites.
   The center said 66 percent of the public knew that the Soviet
Union is supporting U.S. efforts to get Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait and 64 percent knew that other countries will send forces to
defend Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi invasion.
   In other news, the center said that 30 percent of the public, an
unusually large proportion, said they closely followed news about
the economy during the previous four weeks. In May, only 18 percent
said they were paying close attention.
   Comedian Roseanne Barr's controversial rendition of the national
anthem attracted more attention than George Steinbrenner being
forced to give up control of the New York Yankees, the center said.
   Twelve percent followed the Steinbrenner story closely, while 21
percent kept track of the controversy involving Ms. Barr.
   Only 4 percent of Americans said they followed very closely the
ouster of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's first female prime minister.
   The organization surveyed 1,213 adults by telephone from Aug.
9-12. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Bush Order Allows Bank to Operate Programs in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush issued an order Wednesday
allowing the Export-Import Bank to operate its loan guarantee and
credit programs in East Germany.
   Bush's decision will be beneficial to U.S. companies that want
to do business in East Germany, said White House spokesman Bill
Harlow.
   The Export-Import Bank, a U.S. agency, is designed to enhance
exports from the United States by providing loans to foreign
interests.
   The order waived the Jackson-Vanick law, generally used to set
criteria for granting the most favorable U.S. trading relations
with other nations. The law requires that a nation must grant free
immigration and other rights to gain most-favored trading status
with the United States.
   East Germany has met those conditions, but its pending
unification with West Germany made a trade agreement moot, Harlow
said.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of East German farmers
protested today on the square where communism was toppled to demand
protection from free-market forces crushing their industry.
   Late in the day, East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
fired four ministers who dealt most closely with the nation's
crumbling economy.
   Dismissed were Finance Minister Walter Romberg, Agriculture
Minister Peter Pollack, Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl and Justice
Minister Kurt Wuensche.
   Pollack presides over the economic sector of the nation that has
been hardest hit by East Germany's shift to a free market.
   The estimated 30,000 farmers who converged on East Berlin's
Alexanderplatz were part of a nationwide series of strikes.
   At the protest, farmers waved banners demanding protection from
Western competition and black flags of mourning to protest what
they said was the imminent death of their industry.
   ``Ending Agriculture with a Clearance Sale,'' read a large
green-and-white banner spread high above the crowd, a reference to
the slashed prices at which farmers must now sell their goods.
   Just a few hours before de Maiziere announced his removal,
Pollack was pelted with eggs and tomatoes when he tried to speak to
the protesting farmers.
   The protest was the biggest yet among East German farmers, the
most militant and hardest-hit section of the country's troubled
economy.
   The economic merger of the two German states on July 1 opened
the floodgates to Western competition, and East German grocery
stores have been filling their shelves with Western products.
   The large, Soviet-style collective farms that once had a captive
market now are forced to price their products at market levels, and
many are unable to meet their formerly subsidized payrolls.
   Experts say up to half of the collectives, which employ more
than 800,000 people, are essentially bankrupt and doomed to fail
soon. Up to 70 percent of the market has been lost, economists say.
   Rainer Prizkow, who works on a pig farm in the city of
Neuruppin, said his operation has sold no pork in the last month.
   ``We won't survive the winter,'' he said.
   Arno Mittendorf held up a red-and-gold banner awarded to his
collective by the former Communist regime two years ago because the
farm had the highest production in its district of Neubrandenburg.
   Mittendorf, an agricultural economist, said production is the
same, but little is sold.
   ``We can only pay our workers through September,'' he said.
   Experts say up to 4 million of East Germany's 8.8 million
workers could lose their jobs as the nation makes the transition to
the free market.
   Almost 1 million workers are either jobless or working shorter
hours at lower pay under a West German-financed program to keep
workers targeted for layoff on the job.
   Romberg, a member of the left-leaning Social Democrats who are
uneasy coalition partners in de Maiziere's broad-based government,
often clashed with the Christian Democrats who dominate the Cabinet.
   Pohl is a Christian Democrat, and the other two are not aligned
with a party.
   Romberg has been accused of overstating East Germany's economic
situation and once predicted that the country would experience a
``hot autumn,'' a reference to unrest prompted by high unemployment
expected in the fall.

<HEAD>Two Ex-Prosecutors Plead Guilty in Cocaine Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former state prosecutors pleaded guilty
today to cocaine charges in federal court.
   Richard Guida, who headed the attorney general's criminal
division until 1986, pleaded guilty to one count of cocaine
distribution. The offense is a felony, punishable by up to 20 years
in jail and a $1 million fine.
   Michael Trant, who was an associate deputy attorney general,
pleaded guilty to one count of cocaine possession. He could be
sentenced to up to one year in jail and fined $5,000.
   The pleas were entered before U.S. District Judge Edwin Kosik.
Guida and Trant, who served under former state Attorney General
LeRoy Zimmerman, waived indictments and pleaded guilty to the
charges.
   Federal prosecutor Gordon Zubrod said in court that Guida
provided cocaine to friends on a number of occasions between August
1985 and October 1987. During part of that period, he worked as a
state prosecutor.
   Zubrod said the government found no evidence to show that Guida
sold cocaine.
   Guida's plea is conditional on the outcome of a related appeal.
Guida earlier pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of cocaine
possession. But that agreement was dissolved at the request of
federal prosecutors who accused Guida of withholding information.
He appealed.
   If Guida loses the appeal, today's plea would stand. If he wins,
the earlier plea would be reinstated.
   Both men are to be sentenced later.

   The Soviet Union on Wednesday prepared to evacuate
its citizens from Iraq and Kuwait and announced it has sent an
envoy to the Middle East to help settle the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said special
ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left Tuesday for consultations with the
governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries.
   Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United
Nations, is also expected to visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh said at a
regular news briefing.
   ``This visit goes along with the efforts by the Soviet Union to
stop the escalation of tensions in the region and to resolve the
crisis caused by Iraq's aggression against Kuwait,'' he said.
   Gremitskikh said 32 Soviets have managed to leave Iraq by
airplane since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He did not elaborate.
   Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of
foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, including 193 military
advisers to the Iraqi government.
   Iraq has agreed to allow all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but
only via a 1,200-mile route through Iraq to the Iraq-Jordan border.
   All Soviet women, children and invalids will be permitted to
leave Iraq, but not Soviet men. Officials have not said how many of
the Soviets trapped in Iraq are men.
   Gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees were assembling
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Wednesday. Evacuation plans were
hampered by intense desert heat and lack of transportation, he said.
   Iraq will not allow cars with Iraqi license plates to leave the
country, he said, so buses have to be rented in Jordan to transport
the evacuees.
   Gremitskikh reiterated that the Soviet military advisers did not
advise Iraq's President Saddam Hussain to invade Kuwait.
   ``Military advisers who participate in planning military
operations, we do not have such kind of advisers there. They did
not and could not participate in the planning of Iraqi
operations,'' he said.
   He said an unspecified number of Iraqi students were studying at
a Moscow military academy. ``Most of them are about to graduate and
we will have to see what will become of them.''
   Moscow has maintained it prefers a political solution to the
crisis over a military solution and has called for an expanded U.N.
mediation role.
   It has refused to consider participating in a multinational
force or naval barricade of Iraq unless sanctioned by the United
Nations. However, it has sent two warships to the region to protect
commercial shipping and has supported an economic embargo by
cutting arms supplies to Iraq.
   ``We do not support any unilateral actions aimed at establishing
a sea blockade that some countries are considering now,'' Politburo
member Gennady Yanaev told a news conference. ``Any solution by
force might provoke unpredictable consequences. We do not want
those consequences to occur.''
   Yanaev is the Politburo member responsible for international
affairs.

   Marlon Brando's son was released today on $2
million bail after 90 days in jail on charges he killed his
half-sister's boyfriend.
   ``It's good to be out,'' said Christian Brando. ``I'm just going
to go home and try to straighten this out.''
   He was greeted outside the Los Angeles County Jail by his father
and brother Miko, as well as girlfriend Lorene Landon Coughlin.
   ``It's a very special moment, a moment I have long looked
forward to,'' said Marlon Brando. ``I'm proud to have my son out of
jail.''
   The actor had to put up his $5 million estate in the hills above
Los Angeles as collateral.
   Santa Monica Superior Court Judge David Perez approved the
arrangement Tuesday. Christian Brando had been jailed since the May
16 slaying at the estate.
   Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Marlon Brando was asked what he
believed was the best he could hope for in a trial.
   ``The best I could hope for is accidental manslaughter,'' he
said.
   Christian Brando, 32, is accused of shooting to death Dag
Drolett, 26, in an argument at the Brando family manor. Cheyenne
Brando, the actor's 20-year-old daughter, was pregnant at the time
with Drollett's son.
   She has since returned to Tahiti and given birth.
   The judge decided Marlon Brando's home may be used to back his
son's $2 million bail, which was reduced from $10 million last
week. The 66-year-old actor would lose his property if his son
jumped bail.
   Prosecutors vehemently opposed bail for fear Christian Brando
would flee the country.

<HEAD>Auto Manufacturing Put Brakes on Overall Industrial Growth in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automotive output dropped sharply and stalled
overall industrial production in July, the government said
Wednesday, although it noted the economy continued its slow growth
in most other manufacturing areas.
   The Federal Reserve said that while overall output was unchanged
from June, ``excluding motor vehicles, industrial output rose 0.2
percent last month, about the same rate of growth that has been
evident so far this year.''
   In another report Wednesday pointing to continued growth, the
Commerce Department said business sales were up 1.0 percent in
June, while inventories fell 0.4 percent.
   If inventories were to rise excessively in relation to sales, it
could cause production cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses
attempted to sell off the backlog.
   ``It's modest growth,'' Michael K. Evans, head of Evans
Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting firm, said of both
reports. ``Not very exciting, but not recession numbers.''
   Nevertheless, Evans and other analysts pointed out the July
report preceded the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August and they
questioned the impact of the subsequent rise in oil prices on
economic growth later this year.
   While weakness in auto sales has been a major factor
contributing to the overall sluggishness of the economy this year,
economist Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank in New York
said he expects a strong increase in vehicle production this month.
   ``We're going through an intentional car buildup in the third
quarter,'' Niemira said, pointing to a backlog of just 55 days'
supply compared to the normal 60-65 day supply.
   Evans said he thought the auto industry was positioning itself
for a possible strike when the Big Three labor contracts expire
this fall.
   The Fed report also cited a falloff in production of stone, clay
and glass products as further signs of weakness in the construction
industry as well.
   Overall industrial production has fallen just twice so far this
year _ 1.0 percent in January and a slight 0.1 percent in April.
But the rates of growth in the other months have been less than 1
percent, including a 0.4 percent gain in June.
   Production in manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods inched down 0.1 percent in July after a 0.3
percent gain a month earlier. That was even weaker than the 0.5
percent advance first reported.
   Output of durable goods, motor vehicles and other big-ticket
items expected to last at least three years fell 0.4 percent and
offset a 0.4 percent advance in June.
   Manufacturing of non-durable goods such as food and clothing was
up 0.3 percent after a 0.2 increase a month earlier.
   Output at mines jumped 1.0 percent after a flat June, while
utility production was off 0.4 percent after a 1.9 percent gain a
month earlier.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in July stood at
109.9 percent of its 1987 base, the same level as the previous
month.
   The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories,
mines and utilities _ which usually move in tandem with industrial
production _ slipped 0.2 percentage point to 83.4 percent. The
operating rate measures not only output but also changes in
productivity levels.
   The operating rate at factories producing durable goods fell 0.5
percentage point to 81.6 percent, while the rate at plants making
non-durable goods was unchanged at 83.9 percent.
   The operating rate at mines was up 1.1 percentage point to 90.2
percent, while it slipped from 86.2 to 85.7 percent at utilities.

<HEAD>Saudi Officers Ready to Fight Fellow Arabs `To The Death'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi military officers said Wednesday they
have no qualms about fighting fellow Arabs if Iraqi forces invade
their desert kingdom. One pilot declared that if Saddam Hussein
``wants to fight, we will fight to the death.''
   Several Saudi pilots, interviewed by U.S. reporters, said they
were prepared to defend their nation if the Iraqi president
launches an attack. Their squadron commander said his U.S.-trained
pilots were so eager to take on the Iraqis that ``we have to put a
leash on them. ... We have to put a leash on me,''
   Asked about the possibility of fighting fellow Arabs, one pilot
said:
   ``It's not that, it's a matter of pride. We are a nation that is
not willing to start a fight but we will fight to protect the
sovereignty of our country and we will win.''
   Another pilot commented, ``I'm a soldier; when I go to fight, an
enemy is an enemy.''
   Added a third. ``Nobody likes war, but if he wants to fight, we
will fight to the death.''
   The pilots were interviewed at a Saudi air base under ground
rules that prevent the journalists, flown to Saudi Arabia by the
Pentagon, from disclosing the size or location of U.S. and Saudi
troop deployments. Only command-level officers may be quoted by
name.
   The base's commander, Brig Gen. Turki Bin Nasser, a member of
the Saudi royal family, told the reporters:
   ``We would not like to see Arabs fighting Arabs, but if we have
to we will do it. If anybody wants to come to the kingdom and
attack, we will fight to defend ourselves.''
   No Arab nation had taken up arms against other Arabs in modern
times, until Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The Saudi pilots all spoke English and were all trained in the
United States.
   Before the meeting with Turki, the journalists were allowed into
Saudi jet hangars and maintenance facilities that officials said
are off-limits to many Saudis.
   The journalists saw further evidence of the growing U.S.
presence, including the first-ever field deployment of the Patriot
surface-to-air missile system. Transport planes land day and night,
bringing in heavy artillery and other equipment to reinforce
American units deployed after Saddam's army overran Kuwait.
   Turki said that Saudi, American, and British pilots were
conducting joint missions but that many command responsibilities
have yet to be worked out. ``We hope the higher authorities will
solve the problems of command control,'' he said.
   A squadron commander said the three nations' pilots have been
flying as a single force under a single command.
   ``From the first day they arrived here, that plan had to be
implemented before we leave the ground,'' the commander said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to visit Saudi Arabia later
this week, presumably to discuss command questions.
   President Bush committed U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia to protect
the kingdom's oil fields, the world's richest, and to back up his
call for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   American troops are equipped with masks and special suits to
protect themselves against Iraq's formidable supply of chemical and
gas weapons. But Turki questioned Saddam's ability to effectively
use such weapons.
   ``As far as we know, he doesn't have means of delivery with
ballistic missiles but he has the means if they are carried by
aircraft,'' the general said.
   ``Air to air, I have no problem,'' he added, meaning he believes
U.S., Saudi and British air defenses can intercept any Iraqi plans
carrying chemical bombs.
   The Saudi air force is equipped with American F-15s and F-5
fighters, AWACS radar planes and C-130 transports, plus
British-made Hawks, Lightnings and Tornadoes.
   Turki said Saudi Arabia needed help from the United States and
other nations simply because of Iraq's huge army. ``If you face a
million-man army, you have to have a large enough force to deter it
and to fight it if you need to,'' he said.
   He said the threat of an attack by Iraq remains significant,
citing Iraqi defensive positions set up near the Saudi-Kuwaiti
border.
   One Saudi pilot, trained in San Antonio, Texas, called the Iraqi
air force quite strong but no match for a joint Saudi-U.S.-British
defense.
   A squadron commander, who said he received his first training in
Selma, Ala., said Iraqi plans have been spotted near the border
with Kuwait but none has crossed into Saudi airspace.
   ``I don't think it wise for them to cross the border,'' he said.
``We will react to that. ... I'm confident that we could inflict
heavy damage.''

<HEAD>Four Government Ministers Fired; Farmers Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere on
Wednesday fired four Cabinet ministers who had dealt closely with
the nation's crumbling economy. They included the agriculure chief,
who earlier was pelted with eggs by angry farmers.
   The fired officials were Finance Minister Walter Romberg,
Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl, Justice Minister Kurt Wuensche and
Agriculture Minister Peter Pollack.
   Hours before de Maiziere announced the dismissals, Pollack tried
to speak to thousands of protesting farmers on East Berlin's main
square. He was shouted down with cries of ``Bandit!'' and ``Dog!''
   Protesters hurled eggs and tomatoes. During the melee Pollack
was hit on the head by a farmer who grabbed a reporter's
microphone. He was unhurt, but the rear window of his car was
smashed.
   The fired finance minister is a member of the left-leaning
Social Democrats, who are uneasy coalition partners in de
Maiziere's broad-based government. He frequently clashed with the
Christian Democrats, who dominate the Cabinet.
   Pohl is a Christian Democrat. The other two fired ministers are
not aligned with a party.
   Romberg has been accused of overstating East Germany's economic
woes and once predicted that the country would experience a ``hot
autumn,'' a reference to unrest that could be prompted by high
unemployment expected in the fall.
   Farmers have been especially hard-hit by East Germany's shift to
a free market after four decades of socialism.
   On Wednesday, about 50,000 farmers converged on the
Alexanderplatz, the sprawling East Berlin square where protests
last year helped topple Communist rule. They were among hundreds of
thousands of farmers who took part in a series of two-hour strikes,
rallies and other protests across the country.
   The farmers waved black flags to mourn their dying industry and
listened to farm leaders demand an economic bailout from both
German states, which are expected to unify by year's end.
   The economic merger of the two German states July 1 opened the
floodgates to Western competition, and East German grocery stores
have been filling their shelves with Western products.
   The bloated, Soviet-style collective farms that once had a
captive market now are forced to price their products at market
levels, and many are unable to meet their formerly subsidized
payrolls.
   Farmers are sitting on thousands of tons of unsold pork, beef,
produce and grain.
   Experts say up to half of the collectives, which employ more
than 800,000 people, are essentially bankrupt and doomed to fail
soon. Up to 70 percent of the market has been lost, economists say.
   Rainer Prizkow, who works on a pig farm in the city of
Neuruppin, said his operation has sold no pork in the last month.
   ``We won't survive the winter,'' he said.
   Arno Mittendorf held up a red-and-gold banner awarded to his
collective by the former Communist regime two years ago because the
farm had the highest production in its district of Neubrandenburg.
   Mittendorf, an agricultural economist, said production is the
same, but little is sold.
   ``We can only pay our workers through September,'' he said.
   Edgar Mueller, president of an association of farm collectives,
demanded $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion in aid for this year.
   Officials in both German states say the inefficient, overstaffed
farms must change to model the leaner, privately run operations in
the West.
   Protests also were reported in the cities of Rostock, Dresden,
Halle, Gera, Erfurt and Suhl.
   Several highways were blocked by tractors and other farm
equipment.
   Nationwide, up to 700,000 farmers took part in the two-hour
strikes, the East German news agency ADN said.
   Officials say other sections of the economy will quickly follow
the plunging fortunes of the agriculture industry.
   Experts say up to 4 million of East Germany's 8.8 million
workers could lose their jobs as the nation continues its move to a
market economy at an unprecedented pace.
   Almost 1 million workers now are either jobless or working
shorter hours at lower pay under a West German-financed program to
keep workers targeted for layoff on the job.

<HEAD>Inventories at Best Level Since 1984</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A combination of rising business sales and
falling stocks on shelves and back lots in June put inventories at
their most favorable level in at least six years, the government
said Wednesday.
   ``It's a rather impressive decline'' in inventories, said
Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
forecasting firm. ``One of the reasons we start a recession is that
inventories get out of line, and there's no evidence of that
happening.''
   ``It means there's room for more growth if sales hold,'' added
Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York,
who said the inventory correction that began at the beginning of
the year apparently continues.
   In fact, Niemira said, the decline in inventories combined with
strong sales probably means a much better balanced economy in the
second quarter than the government first estimated last month.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales jumped 1.0
percent in June to a seasonally adjusted $544.4 billion, the same
rate of increase as in May. The advances were the strongest since
February, when sales rose 1.4 percent, and regained a 1.0 percent
decline in April.
   Inventories, meanwhile, dropped 0.4 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $797.3 billion, down $3.1 billion from May when
inventories posted a 0.5 percent advance. It was the largest drop
since a similar 0.4 percent decline in February.
   The combination produced a 1.46 ratio of inventories to sales,
the lowest ratio since this series began in 1982, a Commerce
spokesman said. The ratio means it would take 1.46 months to
exhaust the backlog of goods at the June pace. The ratio stood at
1.49 in both April and May.
   If inventories were to pile up excessively while sales slowed,
it could prompt businesses to cut back purchases, resulting in a
drop in production and job layoffs.
   In its initial estimate of second-quarter growth, the Commerce
Department reported last month the 1.2 percent gain in the gross
national product was due almost entirely to a big buildup in
business inventories. Other major components of the economy
declined.
   The initial report on the GNP _ the nation's total output of
goods and services _ will be revised twice including the first
reexamination on Aug. 24 when the June sales-inventory report is
taken into account.
   Wholesalers showed the biggest sales gain in June, 1.7 percent,
while retailers posted a 1.1 percent advance and manufacturers a
0.5 percent increase.
   Wholesalers had a 0.8 percent decline in inventories, followed
by a 0.5 percent drop by manufacturers. Retail inventories, on the
other hand, edged up 0.1 percent.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Black Factional Fighting in South Africa Hits 140</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival black factions battled
Wednesday with axes, spears and other crude weapons, hacking people
and burning homes as four days of fighting brought the death toll
to at least 140.
   ``We just keep on finding bodies,'' a police spokesman said.
   The violence was in three black townships east of Johannesburg.
It pits mostly Xhosa supporters of the African National Congress
against the conservative Zulu Inkatha movement. The independent
South African Press Association said the township fighting was the
worst in years.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but they are divided by leadership
rivalry, tribal loyalty and differing visions of a future South
Africa.
   Police said 140 bodies had been recovered late Tuesday and
Wednesday in Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus. Police and hospital
officials said hundreds of people were injured.
   Columns of armored vehicles and trucks filled with police
bearing assault rifles and shotguns roamed the stricken areas
Wednesday in a show of force.
   Armed bands of Zulus attacked several shantytowns Tuesday night
and early Wednesday. The bands set fire to houses and attacked
fleeing residents with spears, knives and pangas _ a crude
machete-like weapon.
   One resident, who did not want to be named, said he saw ``more
than 2,000'' Zulus with guns, spears, butcher's knives and axes
attack a squatter camp in Katlehong.
   ``I saw mothers with babies on their backs running past my
house. ... I didn't know what was happening and then I saw the
Zulus,'' he said.
   Witnesses said the Zulus searched houses, hunting out and
attacking Xhosa residents. Some residents tried to flee to a nearby
swamp but were chased down and hacked to death. Others died when
their houses were set afire.
   Police used tear-gas barrages and shotguns later Wednesday to
drive back several hundred armed Inkatha supporters who tried to
attack the squatter camp a second time, witnesses said.
   Hundreds of residents gathered for safety in large groups with
the remains of their possessions after their attack. The South
African Red Cross said it was trying to set up refugee camps to
house them.
   Police spokesman Capt. Eugue Opperman said a policeman sustained
shrapnel wounds Wednesday after a hand grenade was hurled by an
unidentified man. He said police had been fired on several
occasions.
   Police seized hundreds of knives, spears and other weapons and
reported finding a chest containing AK-47 assault rifles and
grenades. A large police truck piled with confiscated weapons was
seen leaving Katlehong.
   The South African Press Association reported Wednesday the army
had been called in to assist police, but no troops were seen. South
African Defense Force spokesman Riaan Louw confirmed police had
requested army help, but gave no details.
   The fighting started Sunday after a minor clash, but as of
Tuesday police said only nine people had been killed. Violence
increased after peace talks failed Tuesday.
   The battles between the ANC and Inkatha began spilling into the
townships around Johannesburg in recent weeks. Previously it had
occurred mainly in Natal province. The government cited the
violence when it left in effect a state of emergency in Natal
province. The emergency measures were lifted elsewhere in the
country in June, including Johannesburg.

   Christian Brando pleaded innocent to murdering Dag Drolett, 26,
at the Brando estate May 16. He had been jailed since the shooting.
   After the shooting, Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, 20, gave birth
to Drolett's son in Tahiti, where she reportedly remains.
   Outside the courthouse Wednesday, Marlon Brando said ``the best

   Christian Brando is the son of the actor and his first wife,
Anna Kashfi. The couple divorced in 1960.

   Actress Glenn Close missed a press
conference because she was losing her voice, but was back on the
set Wednesday of the television movie ``Sarah, Plain and Tall.''
   Close, who is also executive producer of the Hallmark Hall of
Fame show, bowed out of a press briefing Tuesday night because
she'd been up since 6 a.m. and was losing her voice, said Russ
Patrick, a Hallmark spokesman.
   Miss Close was back on the set at the Stuhr Museum on Wednesday,
said Lew Cole, the museum's public relations director.
   The museum's Railroad Town became Hays, Kan., circa 1910, this
week when Miss Close and actor Christopher Walken arrived to film
portions of the movie, which will air on CBS this winter.
   Miss Close has been nominated for an Academy Award five times.
Her films include ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and
``The Big Chill.''
   Walken starred in ``The Deer Hunter.''

   Bert Parks has buried the hatchet with the Miss
America Pageant and will sing at the contest's 70th anniversary
show this year.
   Parks, 75, will sing ``There She Is,'' the theme song he made
famous, to a parade of former Miss Americas.
   Parks was fired in January 1980 after hosting the Miss America
Pageant for 25 years. Then-pageant director Albert Marks Jr., who
died last year, said Parks was too old at age 65 to continue.
   During the anniversary show, the new Miss America will be
serenaded by Gary Collins, who will remain the pageant co-host with
Phyllis George.
   Parks said he was ``not crazy about that'' and that the decision
to have Collins sing was made for ``contractual reasons.''
   Parks appeared at a news conference with Dorothy Benham, Miss
America 1977, and Leonard Horn, chief executive officer at the Miss
America Organization.
   They symbolically buried a hatchet in a cake that read,
``Welcome back Bert. Miss America Pageant 1990.''
   It hasn't been decided whether Parks will appear at later
pageants, Horn said.

   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had invited Diana, but last
week Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Bhutto and
declared a state of emergency.
   The Sept. 17-20 trip would have been Diana's first solo journey

   Iraqi authorities have told U.S. envoys that
``new guidelines'' are being prepared governing travel rights of
the estimated 3,000 Americans stranded in Kuwait and Iraq, the
State Department said Wednesday.
   Privately, U.S. officials said they doubted that the rule
changes would permit the Americans to leave. Besides the Americans,
more than 2 million other foreigners have been detained within the
borders of the two countries since the Iraqi invasion two weeks ago.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said an Iraqi
Foreign Ministry official informed a U.S. diplomat in Baghdad on
Tuesday that the new guidelines would be issued.
   ``We are waiting right now,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She continued to refuse to describe the Americans as hostages
and she dismissed as ``pure semantics'' an Iraqi official's
description of the Americans as ``restrictees.''
   ``Whatever terms the Iraqis use, it doesn't change the facts. We
have been telling you for days these people are restricted from
leaving,'' she said. ``There is no secret about this. The world
knows it. Finally, they are admitting behavior that is contrary to
all international norms.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attached no significance
to the Iraqi official's use of the word ``restrictees.''
   ``That's not an official description and not what the government
has told us,'' said Fitzwater, who spoke to reporters while flying
with President Bush back to Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The Iraqi official told ABC News on Tuesday the Americans would
not be allowed to leave Kuwait and Iraq until the current crisis
ends. Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Sadiq Mashat,
has said the Americans will be allowed to leave ``in due time.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi officials have been giving contradictory
information about the status of the Americans. She said the
administration has been avoiding the term ``hostage'' because the
Iraqis have made no demands for their release and they are not
``bound and gagged.''
   Iraqi authorities have closed airports and borders to most
foreigners since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Ten Americans
connected to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad were allowed to leave last
Saturday and another group was expected to be allowed out soon.
   About 500 Americans are estimated to have slipped out of Kuwait,
circumventing the Iraqi travel ban. The State Department has been
discouraging Americans from trying to leave since a British citizen
was shot to death during an escape attempt last weekend.

   Iran's spiritual leader Wednesday called
the stationing of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia an ``insult to the
Moslem people of that country,'' Tehran radio reported.
   Speaking at a religious gathering in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei said the United States was using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
as a pretext to strengthen its military presence in the region.
   Lashing out at Saudi Arabia for inviting the U.S. forces,
Khamenei said ``those governments which invited the U.S. forces to
their countries are devoid of grassroots support, and do not
command the backing of their peoples.
   ``This is the reason they are unable to defend themselves,'' he
added.
   He said the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia was an
``insult to the Moslem people of that country.''
   ``They will have to pay a dear price for the bullying, U.S.
military forces,'' he said.
   Khamenei also condemned the West and Arab countries that backed
Iraq in its eight-year war against Iran, and said: ``Global
arrogance and reactionary regimes of the region maintained an
inhumane silence during the eight-year incursion against Iran.''
   Iran often refers to the United States and the West as ``global
arrogance.''
   Khamenei made his comments before Iraq offered to seek a formal
peace treaty to end the Iran-Iraq war, according to the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
   Some analysts fear that anti-American radicals in Iran will
pressure the government to back Iraq in the current gulf crisis to
help force the U.S. military out of the region.
   Iranian officials have criticized Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait, but have also denounced the dispatch of foreign forces
to the region.
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were Baghdad's largest financial backers
during the Iran-Iraq war, extending an estimated $30 billion to
Iraq in loans for its war efforts.

<HEAD>Bush Considering First Call-Up of `Weekend Warriors' in 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering the
first call-up in more than 20 years of the nation's ``weekend
warriors,'' the reservists the Pentagon has come to rely on to back
up its fulltime military men and women.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney discussed the reserves question
with Bush in a private meeting at the Pentagon Wednesday, but the
defense secretary has not decided on a recommendation, said Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.
   The issue is politically sensitive because of the public
perception that a reserve mobilization is tantamount to a
declaration that the nation is on a war footing.
   More than 20,000 active-duty U.S. ground forces already are in
Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield to help deter an
Iraqi attack on the desert kingdom. The Pentagon has contingency
plans to deploy as many as 250,000 troops.
   Some reservists called to active duty would be deployed to U.S.
military installations and ports to help with the transportation of
troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia, while others would make the
7,000-mile trip as part of the U.S. combat force.
   The president has the authority to activate as many as 200,000
reservists for 90 days. He can extend the period an additional 90
days without declaring a national emergency.
   Reservists perform a wide range of combat roles on the ground,
at sea and in the air.
   Military officials said the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia will be
seriously hobbled if at least some of the nation's 1.2 million
Army, Navy and Air Force reservists are not mobilized.
   The last time that reserves were ordered to active duty was in
1968, when President Johnson called up 35,280 reserves after the
start of the Tet offensive in Vietnam and the seizure by North
Korea of the surveillance ship Pueblo. Those reserves served on
active duty from January 1968 to December 1969.
   Most reservists train for one weekend a month, in addition to a
two-week training session each year. Some work fulltime with
active-duty units as civilians but also perform their reserve
training. Others are not obligated to train at all.
   Some military officials said they foresaw at least a partial
mobilization of reservists, although a Pentagon spokesman, Maj.
Doug Hart, said no decision had been made.
   The services have come to depend on reserve forces for a wide
variety of military missions.
   The Army, for example, relies on reservists to fill 80 percent
of its combat service support units, including medical specialists
and engineers. Its armored divisions typically include two brigades
of active-duty soldiers and one brigade of reservists.
   ``The U.S. Army cannot sustain a major deployment, except with
great difficulty, without them,'' said one Army strategist who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Reservists served voluntarily during the U.S. invasion of Panama
last December, and others volunteered for minesweeping operations
when the United States began escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf starting in 1987.
   About 1,000 members of National Guard units already have
participated in the Saudi Arabian deployment as volunteers. No
guard or reserve units have been ordered to active duty, Hart said.
   The largest contingent of reserve forces is the Army National
Guard, with 457,000 members, according to Pentagon figures. There
are 319,000 members in the Army Reserve, 151,000 in the Navy
Reserve, 116,000 in the Air National Guard, 83,000 in the Air Force
Reserve and 43,000 in the Marine Corps Reserve.
   In addition to those nearly 1.2 million reservists, the services
have 460,000 people in the Individual Ready Reserve and the
Inactive National Guard. These are former active-duty personnel who
could be called on in a national emergency but are not trained as
extensively.
   Reservists are most often called on to assist in natural
disasters. For example, Air Force Reserve C-130 Hercules transport
planes from the 913th Tactical Airlift Group in Pennsylvania flew
relief missions after the San Francisco earthquake last October.

<HEAD>Higher Production May Bring Some Price Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers will see some relief from record
meat prices as production increases next year, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   Retail pork prices are expected to decline 1 percent to 3
percent in 1991 from this year's record level, the department's
Economic Research Service said. Poultry prices may be down 4
percent to 6 percent.
   The 1991 forecast was based on indications that farmers will
boost livestock production in response to favorable returns this
year.
   However, beef production is not expanding enough to keep up with
population growth, so further price increases can be expected next
year. But the report said 1991 retail beef prices may rise only 1
percent to 2 percent.
   In 1990, the report said, retail pork prices are expected to
climb an average of 12 percent from last year.
   Overall, 1990 poultry prices, which include broilers and
turkeys, were forecast to drop 2 percent as production rises this
year.
   Analysts said per capita consumption of red meat and poultry may
rise about six pounds in 1991 from the record level of about 220
pounds annually in 1990 and 1989.

<HEAD>Europe Unites on Sanctions, Divides Over Military Response</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Europe remains united on economic sanctions
against Iraq but divided over the U.S.-led military response to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   There has been a notable lack of enthusiasm in Europe for
joining the U.S.-led multinational force to defend Saudi Arabia.
Only Britain and The Netherlands have committed troops.
   Support for the sanctions, meanwhile, is virtually unanimous and
is the first major issue on which Eastern Europe and Western Europe
have been united.
   Geographically, Europe is a strategic link in the military
operation, but there are worries about how severely that link may
be tested in coming days.
   Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany and Greece have given the United
States access to some bases to use for the Persian Gulf operation.
That contrasts with the situation in April 1986, when only Britain
allowed U.S. planes to use bases for the bombing of Libya.
   Denmark is permitting its merchant ships in the gulf to act as
supply vessels for the multinational force.
   But Italy, Belgium and Spain, while preparing or sending
warships to the eastern Mediterranean, are waiting at least until
Tuesday's Paris meeting of the nine-nation West European Union
before making any commitment to the multinational effort. Belgium
said it wants the union, the main European pillar of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, to assume a more active role in
coordinating a European contribution.
   Italy, president of the 12-nation European Community, ``cannot
remain in the rear guard,'' commentator Antonio Maccanico wrote in
a page-one opinion piece in Il Messaggero, the Rome-based national
daily.
   Germany, in a unique position because its constitution bars the
military from operating outside NATO territory, remains split over
sending ships to the gulf. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was quoted as
saying West German minesweepers would join a European naval group
sent to the gulf, but Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
remains opposed on constitutional grounds.
   Some Greeks, including former Premier Andreas Papandreou, have
expressed fears of retaliation if they go beyond the letter of the
U.N. Security Council resolution barring trade with Iraq.
   Francis Tusa, European editor of Armed Forces Journal
International, said there has been some serious concern in Europe
that ``the Americans are going in feet first, gung ho.''
   In their drive to put teeth into the sanctions, the United
States and Britain have declared their navies are ready to prevent
ships from carrying goods to and from Iraq. Australia has said its
ships are ready to do the same.
   ``We are determined not to see sanctions busted,'' Sir Crispin
Tickell, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday.
   But France and the Soviet Union, formerly Iraq's main arms
suppliers, have said the U.N. Security Council must decide when any
interdiction takes place. Both have sent sizable naval forces but
refuse to participate in any barricade without U.N. authorization.
   Gennady Yanaev, the Politburo member responsible for
international affairs for the Soviet Communist Party, told a Moscow
news conference Wednesday that economic sanctions should be given
time.
   ``I emphasize, any solution by force might provoke unpredictable
consequences,'' he said. ``We believe that common sense will
triumph without any military force.''
   The Independent, a leading British daily, said a U.S. barricade
not authorized by the U.N. ``would risk breaking ... the broad
coalition that made the embargo possible and thus jeopardize the
embargo itself.''
   But The Daily Telegraph, a conservative newspaper, said unless
goods are stopped and sanctions enforced, they are worthless.
   ``If that can be done under a U.N. mandate, so much the better.
If not, then we should accept the necessity for the American,
British and Australian navies to do the job on their own,'' the
Telegraph said.

   When Iraqi's Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he
let comedian Roseanne Barr off the hook.
   A Chicago entrepreneur had planned to produce a poster of Ms.
Barr, with a bull's eye superimposed on it, after she shrieked the
national anthem at a baseball game, offending Americans all the way
up to President Bush.
   But Saddam has outraged even more people, and Mike McCormack put
the Barr poster on a back burner to print up 40,000 Saddam targets.
   ``The poster allows Americans to relieve a lot of frustration,''
said McCormack, president of ACBA Co., producer of the poster.
``It's designed for people using darts or at rifle ranges.''
   ``We're not advocating any form of violence, just emotional
release,'' he said.
   McCormack plans to begin production this week on the first batch
of the 17-by-22-inch posters of Saddam, complete with a two-ring
bull's eye. The posters will be available at poster shops and rifle
stores nationwide on Aug. 20, McCormack said. He said the $4.50
poster also will be sold in Europe.
   Americans detained in the Middle East will receive Saddam
posters when they return home, McCormack said.
   His company produced and sold about 1.5 million similar posters
of the late Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, during the
Iranian hostage crisis, he said.

   In a small office off Forbes Field,
volunteers answer telephone calls around-the-clock for relatives of
airmen who have gone on active duty with the Kansas Air National
Guard because of the Mideast crisis.
   Sometimes the callers want to know whether fighting has broken
out. Sometimes they want to know things like how to unplug a
stopped-up sink.
   ``Whatever arises, we'll find a cure for it,'' said a volunteer
named Vicki, whose husband has gone on active duty. Members of the
support group have decided not to give their last names for the
time being.
   ``I've had calls from family members who are very distressed
about the situation,'' said Captain D. L. Mitchell, chaplain for
the 190th Air Refueling Group, a unit of state guard. ``We have a
barrage of calls after each presidential announcement.''
   Last week, Gov. Mike Hayden approved a Department of Defense
request allowing 500 members of the unit to go on active duty after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The unit has 955 members, including
about 300 people who are full time.
   On Saturday, three of the unit's KC-135 aerial tankers left
Forbes Field, reportedly for Saudi Arabia, although National Guard
officials declined to comment. The tankers refuel jet fighters and
bombers while aloft.
   Most National Guard airmen serve one weekend a month and two
weeks during the summer. The prospect of going on active duty
during a national crisis doesn't occur to many people when they
sign up, Mitchell said.
   Many left spouses, children and jobs behind them.
   Mitchell acknowledges that some wives are a bit dazed by the
developments, telling him: ``I was not ready for this.''
   Frequently, he invites them to join the family support group as
volunteers, so they feel like they are part of the effort.
   ``We have more help than we can use, but we use all the help we
get,'' said Vicki.
   Capt. John Andrews, family support coordinator for the Kansas
National Guard, said he receives many questions about benefits and
insurance. In some cases, wives of airmen who have gone on active
duty might not have paid the bills and need advice on how to do it,
he said.
   Members of the 190th come to Topeka from all over Kansas and the
surrounding states, including one person from Colorado Springs,
Colo., Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Party Official Appeals for Halt to Attacks on Lenin Statues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's top ideologist appealed to
the nation Wednesday to stop a series of attacks on statues of
Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union.
   Politburo member and party ideology chief Alexander S. Dzasokhov
told viewers of the nightly television news program ``Vremya'' that
the party's secretariat held a ``very serious and worried
discussion'' Wednesday on the various assaults on Lenin monuments.
   In recent weeks, monuments to Lenin have been destroyed in
dozens of towns in the republic of Georgia; vandals have disfigured
statues from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific; and authorities in the
republics of Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, Moldavia and the Ukraine
have acted to dismantle them by legislative means.
   This week's edition of Moscow News reported that in the town of
Petro-Pavlovsk-Kamchatsky, in the Soviet Far East, a statue to
Lenin was defiled by someone who scrawled the word ``hangman'' on
it in white paint. City Police Chief Ivan Dankulinets said the
local prosecutor's office and KGB is investigating, but no one has
been arrested.
   Despite the changes that have taken place under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev with previous leaders such as Josef Stalin and Leonid I.
Brezhnev being officially denounced, Lenin remains a sacred, almost
grandfatherly figure to many Soviet citizens.
   ``There has been a stream of telegrams and messages from Soviet
citizens censuring the defilement of monuments to the founder of
our state, and they have called for urgent measures to stop it,''
Dzasokhov said.
   He compared the attacks on Lenin statues to the destruction of
temples and churches ``during the tragic years of the 1930s'' under
Stalin.
   Dzasokhov said the party secretariat would push for legislation
to protect the statues as cultural and historic monuments.
   The secretariat also called on the Foreign Ministry and the
Ministry of Culture to hold talks with authorities in Eastern
European nations to obtain guarantees that monuments, memorial
plaques and museums connected to Soviet history in those countries
will be adequately protected, the Tass news agency reported.
   As Communists have lost power across Eastern Europe the past two
years, statues to Soviet figures such as Lenin have been removed _
sometimes with decorum and sometimes with disrespect.
   Dzasokhov singled out for criticism those local authorities in
Soviet republics who have decided to dismantle the monuments
through legislation.
   Tass reported the party secretariat noted that city councils in
the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, as well as the Ukrainian cities of
Ternopol and Chervonograd had ordered that Lenin statues be taken
down, ``thereby demonstrating disrespect not only for the Soviet
state founder but also for history itself.''
   Last month, the Ternopol City Council voted 64-0, with 21
abstentions, to remove the statues of Lenin and Karl Marx, the
father of modern communism, by Sept. 21, in time for the city's
450th anniversary. The city reportedly is seeking to sell the
statues.
   The Moscow City Council, now headed by radical reformers, voted
this summer to remove a huge bust of Lenin from its chambers.
   Dzasokhov said that in the past, ``there were people trying to
debunk Lenin in intellectual ways and in fanatical ways.''
   He urged public and cultural figures to fight these ``fallacious
actions.''
   ``Lenin's name is alive and will stay alive,'' Dzasokhov
concluded, ``and Lenin's doctrine is dynamic and not a static one.''

Losses</HEAD>

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins outlined oil
production and conservation proposals Wednesday that he said by
yearend could replace up to 90 percent of the supplies lost because
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Half the saving would come only if Americans accept conservation
efforts that, for example, would require them to keep tires
properly inflated and drive at the speed limit or less.
   The other half, achieved by stepping up domestic oil production,
could require some compromises on the environment.
   ``This is what we should be doing at home to minimize the
disruption that is taking place,'' Watkins told reporters.
   Watkins said there is no indication that President Bush is
considering relaxing rules on offshore drilling because of the
Mideast crisis. The secretary said the government continues to
consider whether the nation's 587 million-barrel Strategic
Petroleum Reserve should be tapped because of the disruption of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Watkins said his proposals should not be taken to mean that the
United States is expecting oil shortages the rest of the year. The
world has ample oil on hand, he said, even though the market is
being denied 4.2 million barrels each day because of Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait and the resulting international boycott of both
countries' oil.
   The world price of oil has risen significantly since the Aug. 2
invasion and is hovering about $26 a barrel. ``Nobody believes it's
going to drop precipitously,'' Watkins said.
   Before the invasion, the United States was importing between
600,000 and 700,000 42-gallon barrels per day from Iraq and Kuwait,
or about 4 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. The list of
proposals outlined by Watkins would, by the end of the year,
replace up to 550,000 barrels of that, he estimated.
   But a lot of things would have to happen before those savings
were realized. Here are items on Watkins' list:
   _Boost production from Alaska's North Slope, now 1.8 million
barrels daily, by 50,000 barrels. That could be done within 90
days, Watkins said.
   _The department would attempt to mediate a long-running dispute
over whether oil from the offshore Point Arguello fields in
California should be transported to refinery via pipeline or ship.
Chevron Oil and Santa Barbara County authorities welcome mediation,
Watkins said. If successful, it could produce an extra 75,000
barrels a day within six months.
   _Encourage utilities to switch from oil to other fuels, even
those that are more expensive, saving 100,000 barrels a day. This
could require relaxed environmental regulations.
   _Boost production of Naval Petroleum Reserve fields, mainly Elk
Hills, Calif., by 5,000 barrels a day by October.
   _Ask state regulators to be more flexible in setting
``allowables'' _ determining who may extract oil from what fields
and in what quantities. This could raise 30,000 barrels a day by
yearend.
   _Operate ethanol-producing facilities, now running at 80 percent
of capacity, at full speed, resulting in production of more gasohol
and saving 10,000 barrels of oil per day.
   The secretary's conservation proposals are far more tentative.
Nevertheless, he said, ``We must begin to get Americans, without
changing their lifestyles, to begin reducing consumption.''
   Watkins estimated:
   _Operating automobiles at proper tire pressure would save
100,000 barrels of oil a day because of improved gas mileage. He
said the department plans a campaign to have service stations make
the point to customers.
   _Driving at the posted speed limit or slower would save 50,000
barrels daily.
   _Another 40,000 barrels daily would be saved if only 20 percent
of families with two cars used the more efficient vehicle. Over
half of U.S. households have two or more cars.
   _Increased use of carpools would save 90,000 barrels a day.

   One of every four births in the United States
in 1988 was to an unwed mother, the government said Wednesday. The
1 million births to unmarried women was an 8 percent increase over
the previous year.
   The report, by the Department of Health and Human Services, said
that while the rates for children born out of wedlock were highest
among black women, the rates have been rising faster for white
mothers.
   The statistics also saw a rise in births to young teen-agers for
the second straight year, after declining through much of the 1970s
and 1980s. There were 33.8 births per 1,000 population to
teen-agers ages 15 to 17.
   HHS said the largest annual increase for any age group was to
women ages 40 to 44, up 9 percent from 1987 and 20 percent over
1985. Birth rates for women in their 30s have risen more than 40
percent since 1975.
   Nearly two in three births to unwed mothers was among blacks and
it was one in three for Hispanics. For whites the proportion was
nearly one out of five. The overall average was one in four.
   ``The highest levels of births to unmarried mothers continued to
be among women ages 18 to 24,'' HHS said.
   Since unmarried mothers are much less likely than married
mothers to begin prenatal care early, the proportion of women
beginning such care in the first trimester showed no improvement
through the 1980s and remains at 76 percent, HHS said.
   The percentage was particularly low among black and Hispanic
women.

   After four months of patching streets,
sweeping gutters and mowing lawns, inmates at a National Guard
armory have repaired something even bigger: their image.
   County Sheriff Michael Ashe said Wednesday he's not surprised
that Holyoke, which greeted the surplus prisoners from nearby
Springfield with trepidation and a lawsuit, has been won over by
good behavior.
   ``I'm just pleased that things are going well,'' said the
mild-mannered lawman. He catapulted into national news in February
when he solved his overcrowding problems by commandeering an armory
in Springfield and refusing to budge until suitable quarters were
found for his inmates.
   Ashe and state officials compromised by moving the prisoners 10
miles to a vacant National Guard armory in this western
Massachusettes town. The agreement was met with horror by Holyoke
residents, who feared the inmates would upset the neighborhood and
could pose a problem for a preschool center across the street.
   But those fears haven't materialized, said Mary E. Kates,
director of Holyoke's library, a few blocks from the armory.
   ``I was a little apprehensive, especially when I heard it was
being located so close to the Early Childhood Learning Center,''
said Kates.
   Now, she is full of praise for her new neighbors.
   ``They sweep the curb and get rid of that and then they've been
sweeping our walks, picking up any trash that's been disposed of in
the park and they've been edging and removing weeds,'' she said.
``I've got loads of projects.''
   The saga began Feb. 16 when Ashe dug up a 17th-century statute
allowing sheriffs to demand aid and assistance and marched into a
National Guard armory in Springfield, the main city in Hampden
County. Stunned guard officials watched as the sheriff installed
about a dozen prisoners.
   State officials eventually decided that Ashe was justified in
taking extraordinary measures. Ashe's century-old jail was built to
hold 279 inmates, is under federal orders to hold no more than 500
and had a waiting list at the time of the seizure.
   When the compromise was reached, angry Holyoke officials filed a
lawsuit trying to block the transfer, but Ashe prevailed, moving in
quietly in April.
   Holyoke Mayor Martin Dunn said Wednesday he's still not thrilled
with the location of the temporary jail, scheduled to be used until
a new, permanent jail is built in the county. But he said he's
dropped the lawsuit and intends to keep using the inmates for such
projects as park renovation.
   ``We've had them cleaning city lots, filling potholes,'' he
said. ``Basically it's been going very well. It's been a productive
experience.''
   Ashe, who has a master's degree in social work, has won
accolades for his innovative jail and community programs, including
his pre-release program and a jail garden project teaming inmates
and senior citizens.
   Inmates sent to the Holyoke center are those who are close to
the end of their sentences and are serving for minor offences. From
the beginning, Ashe called the Holyoke armory a ``Community Service
Center,'' and assured residents the inmates would bring nothing but
good to their neighborhood.

<HEAD>GAO Calls For Tighter Control Of Government-Backed Enterprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

   Closer federal supervision is needed to avoid
a savings-and-loan style crisis among government-sponsored
enterprises providing low-cost loans to home buyers, farmers and
students, congressional auditors said Wednesday.
   ``The government has little ability to identify, prevent or
contain the effects of the kinds of problems that have led to
taxpayer losses in the past,'' the General Accounting Office said
in a report.
   The GAO, as required by last year's S&amp;L bailout bill, examined
the potential for a similar crisis among eight so-called
government-sponsored enterprises, with collective obligations of
more than $800 billion.
   It said closer government oversight was needed of three of the
biggest: Sallie Mae, which finances four of every 10 college loans,
and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together finance about one
fourth of the nation's home mortgages.
   The enterprises were created by Congress but earn profits for
private stockholders. They are more formally known, respectively,
as the Student Loan Marketing Association, the Federal National
Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   While there is no evidence that any of the enterprises are in
danger of immediate failure, the GAO said they have many of the
same unhealthy incentives that existed in the thrift industry.
   They are not explicitly guaranteed by the government, but most
private investors assume Congress and the administration would not
stand idly by were one to near failure.
   ``It seems clear that ... the federal ties cause investors to
behave like insured depositors who believe their investments to be
very safe,'' the report said.
   In fact, Congress in 1987 approved $4 billion in
government-guaranteed bonds to prop up the Farm Credit Banks and
the Banks for Cooperatives, which finance agriculture.
   Because of the perception of government backing for the
enterprises, it is easy for them to raise money even when they are
ailing, the GAO said.
   ``The enterprises can continue to borrow money in private
markets even when performing poorly,'' the GAO said.
   ``In financially troubled times, after capital is depleted,
owners and managers may have incentives to take unusual risks in a
last-ditch effort to recover,'' it said.
   The GAO recommended that private investors in the enterprises be
required to put up more of their own money, or capital, to insulate
taxpayers from risk and provide an incentive against reckless
behavior.
   And the risk-taking and capital levels of Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac and Sallie Mae need closer government supervision, it said. No
agency oversees Sallie Mae, while the Department of Housing and
Urban Development oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
   The auditors expressed skepticism that HUD, whose mission is to
provide Americans with affordable housing, could properly ensure
the safety of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
   ``The department has not provided the kind of safety and
soundness supervisory controls normally imposed by banking
regulators,'' the GAO said.
   ``The government cannot depend on the department to reconcile
its role as a safety and soundness regulator with its role as a
promoter of housing,'' it said.
   Other enterprises included in the report were the Federal Home
Loan Banks, which provide money for home mortgages; the College
Construction Loan Insurance Association, which supports
construction on college campuses, and the Federal Agricultural
Mortgage Corp., which supports farming.
   The GAO's findings are similar to the conclusions in a Treasury
Department study issued in May. In that report, the Bush
Administration backed a controversial proposal to require
government-sponsored enterprises to meet the standards applied by
independent credit-rating agencies to the healthiest private
corporations with triple-A ratings.
   The GAO said it would present more specific recommendations when
it issues a second report, due next May. Wednesday's report was
issued three months late.

   The American Red Cross is sending 12 workers
to the Persian Gulf to help U.S. forces keep contacts with their
families, the Red Cross said Wednesday.
   Spokeswoman Diane Powers said one Red Cross volunteer arrived in
the gulf Tuesday and four others will depart with a Marine unit
Thursday. The remaining seven will be assigned to U.S. forces in
the Persian Gulf soon, she said.
   Their main function will be helping military personnel reach
their families in emergency situations.
   The workers will staff a 24-hour electronic emergency
communications system linking service personnel with more than
2,700 Red Cross chapters in the United States, Ms. Powers said.
   The Red Cross also will provide emergency financial assistance
for troops sent to the gulf to defend Saudi Arabia and other
countries in the region following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The Red Cross workers are traveling to the Mideast at the
request of the Defense Department.

   The Soviet Union on Wednesday restored the
citizenship of an undetermined number of exiles, and among those
reported on the list were Nobel Prize-winning authors Joseph
Brodsky and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
   In his second major human rights decree in three days, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``canceled the decrees on citizenship
concerning a number of persons who are now living abroad,'' the
official news agency Tass reported.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the order
``concerns a rather large number of people. Some names were
mentioned _ Brodsky, Solzhenitsyn.''
   ``I just heard that ostensibly Mr. Solzhenitsyn got back his
Soviet citizenship, but I don't know for sure,'' Gremitskikh said.
   In a statement issued in her husband's name from their home in
Cavendish, Vt., Natalia Solzhenitsyn said: ``In Solzhenitsyn's
case, the original decree was not only a deprivation of
citizenship, but before that a forced eviction from the U.S.S.R.
that was accomplished through arrest and the accusation of treason.
Since nothing has been said about that in today's resolution, it
does not apply to Solzhenitsyn.''
   Brodsky, who lives in New York, were not immediately available
for comment.
   The brief Tass report said the order dealt with ``injustices
that occurred between 1966 and 1988,'' but did not say if it
affected everyone whose citizenship was revoked then. Nor did it
name anyone. Gremitskikh said he did not know the number of people
affected but that it was not in the thousands.
   Tass later reported that those people whose citizenship was
being restored would be informed by the Foreign Ministry.
   Solzhenitsyn is the author of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which
depicted the horrors of dictator Josef Stalin's prison camps. He
was charged with treason in 1974, stripped of his citizenship and
expelled.
   Brodsky, a poet and essayist, was forced to emigrate in 1972
under threat of imprisonment for his political comments.
   Publication of works by both Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky was barred
for years in the Soviet Union, but the restrictions were gradually
lifted under the reform policies pushed by Gorbachev, who came to
power in March 1985.
   On Monday, Gorbachev issued a decree restoring the rights of all
victims of Stalin's repressions, saying thousands of innocent
people still bore ``a stain of injustice.'' Gorbachev said he took
the action because ``our society ... has chosen the path of moral
revival, democracy, and legality.''
   A 1989 Soviet high school history textbook says 40 million
people were ``repressed,'' a word used to cover death,
imprisonment, exile and other punishments.
   Under Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet government revoked the
citizenship of prominent authors and artists who spoke out against
domestic repression. However, Gorbachev has restored the
citizenship of such notables as cellist and conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich and his wife, singer Galina Vishnevskaya.
   Rostropovich, who has conducted the National Symphony Orchestra
of Washington, D.C. for 13 years, returned to Moscow in February
for a triumphant concert. He promptly held a press conference to
call for the government to drop treason charges against
Solzhenitsyn and apologize.
   Wednesday's announcement said nothing about the treason charges
against Solzhenitsyn.
   Other exiled cultural figures have returned for visits in recent
years under Gorbachev, although most have stayed in the West. One
exception was theater director Yuri Lyubimov, who has resumed his
job as director of Moscow's Taganka Theater.
   Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970.
Government pressure on him increased after that, and in February
1974 he was arrested on the treason charge, which carried a
possible death sentence. He was put on a plane to West Germany and
stripped of his citizenship.
   Solzhenitsyn's opus, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' was published in
the Soviet Union last year. Other well-known works include ``One
Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``Cancer Ward.''
   Brodsky was forced to emigrate in June 1972 after secret police
gave him a choice to leave or ``face the consequences.'' He
understood the threat to mean he might face another prison term if
he stayed.
   Brodsky left behind an eloquent appeal to Brezhnev, who was then
Soviet leader, that he be permitted to return home one day.
   ``Although I am losing my Soviet citizenship, I do not cease to
be a Russian poet. I belong to Russian culture, I feel part of it.
   ``I feel bitter as I leave Russia, I was born, raised and have
lived here and I owe everything I have in the world to Russia,'' he
said.
   He was sentenced to five years in a labor camp in 1964 after
being convicted in 1964 of ``parasitism,'' but released after 18
months. Parasitism was considered the crime of not holding a job.
Many dissidents were fired, barred from working and then found
guilty of parasitism.
   Brodsky moved to New York and became an American citizen. Only a
few of his works were published in the Soviet Union until the
literary monthly Novy Mir printed a selection after he won the 1987
Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Moscow News reported Wednesday that a book of Brodsky's poetry
is being published for the first time in the Soviet Union. The
Northwest publishing house in Leningrad plans 100,000 copies of the
book, ``The Autumn Cry of the Hawk.''
   Solzhenitsyn came under particular criticism in his homeland
because he condemned not only Stalin but also Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, calling him ``evil.'' Lenin is still revered by
most Soviets.

<HEAD>Lew DeWitt, Statler Brothers Tenor For 18 Years, Died At Home</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto RM1</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WAYNESBORO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lew DeWitt, who sang tenor for the
Statler Brothers and composed ``Flowers on the Wall,'' one of the
country group's biggest hits, died Wednesday after a long illness.
He was 52.
   DeWitt, who left the group in 1982 because of a severe
intestinal disorder, died Wednesday morning at home in his sleep,
said Chet Fitzgerald, his road manager and business manager.
   ``We knew how bad his health was of course, but we were not
expecting this so soon,'' said Ann Peters, the group's spokeswoman.
``We're shocked. our prayers go out to his family.''
   The 1965 hit ``Flowers on the Wall'' sold more than 1 million
copies and has been recorded by about 30 other artists.
   DeWitt had regional enteritis, or Crohn's disease, an
inflammation of the digestive tract.
   He left the group on doctor's orders, but continued to perform
sporadically with the Star City Band. DeWitt retired permanently
last November.
   He was replaced at tenor by Jimmy Fortune of Charlottesville.
   DeWitt and three boyhood friends _ Harold Reid, Phil Balsley and
Joe McDorman _ formed the Four-Star Quartet in 1948. The group,
later known as the Kingsmen, sang mostly gospel music. McDorman
quit and was replaced by Don Reid, Harold's younger brother.
   DeWitt once said the group changed its again because several
other acts _ all better known _ were billed as the Kingsmen. The
new name came from a box of Statler tissue, he said.
   The quartet switched to country music in 1964, after meeting
country singer Johnny Cash and joining his road show.
   Over the next two decades, the Statlers won three Grammy Awards
and were named top vocal groups nine times by the Country Music
Association.
   DeWitt is survived by his wife, Judy; four children, Denver,
Brian, Donna Kay DeWitt and Shannon DeWitt, and his mother, Rose
Hogan DeWitt.
   A private family memorial was planned.

   Its creators call it art with a message. But when
a poster showing kissing men and women was displayed Wednesday on
city buses, two politicians said freedom of speech had gone too far.
   ``Where will we draw the line in terms of this
homosexuality-heterosexuality thing?'' said city Alderman Robert
Shaw, who said he would introduce an ordinance banning the AIDS
awareness poster.
   ``Is anything going on in this country now (acceptable) under
the guise of free speech?''
   About 80 of the posters, which depict three couples _ one
heterosexual, one lesbian and one gay _ each locked in a romantic
kiss, were displayed Wednesday on buses and at transit stations.
   ``Kissing Doesn't Kill: Greed and Indifference Do,'' reads the
poster, created by a New York art collective. A version has
appeared in the mass transit systems of both New York and San
Francisco.
   ``It's our way of saying we're all affected by AIDS,'' said Gran
Fury collective member Loring McAlpin.
   ``Yes, we are affirming sexuality across the board,'' said
McAlpin. ``We don't think it's advocating a homosexual lifestyle.''
   The posters were approved earlier this year and refusing to
display them would violate the First Amendment protection of free
speech, said Alfred Savage, executive director of the Chicago
Transit Authority.
   ``Under the law, we have a requirement to post them,'' Savage
said. ``We have no jurisdiction over the content.''
   The transit authority was sued last year for refusing to post
another AIDS awareness poster it deemed ``too black-oriented.''
   After the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit, the
authority began displaying the ads, said John Hammell, who directs
the ACLU's AIDS and Civil Liberties Program in Chicago.
   Shaw said he planned to call a special City Council meeting to
discuss his proposed ordinance, which would bar depictions such as
that in Gran Fury's poster.
   ``This poster has nothing to do with the cure of AIDS,'' he
said. ``It has something to do with promoting a lifestyle, which I
object to.''
   State Rep. Robert Regan, a Republican, said Tuesday he would
reintroduce legislation in the Illinois General Assembly that would
bar such displays of sexuality. A similar bill failed this spring.
   McAlpin said the poster, paid for by the New York-based American
Foundation for AIDS research, overcame initial objections in San
Francisco and New York.
   ``Nobody said, `This is great, we'll take it' _ there was a
certain amount of resistance,'' he said.
   The poster is intended to address the deadly virus ``as an
epidemic of corporate greed, government inaction and public
indifference,'' she said. ``We don't believe anyone is going to see
that ad and change their sexual preference.''

   The government's Nazi-hunting agency Wednesday
sought to revoke the citizenship of a Somerset, N.J., man alleged
to have killed Jewish prisoners at the Koldyczewo concentration
camp in World War II Poland.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations said
Sergis Hutyrczyk was a member of the Byelorussian
``Shutzmannschaft,'' the local police controlled by Nazi Germany,
and participated in killing Jewish and other prisoners at the camp
as well as Jews in and around the city of Baranowicze.
   Baranowicze, then part of Poland, now is in the Byelorussian
Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union.
   The OSI said in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Newark that Hutyrczyk was a supervising guard known to Koldyczewo
inmates as the ``Black Commander.''
   ``Because of his wartime activities and postwar lies,
Hutyrczyk's citizenship must be revoked,'' OSI Director Neil Sher
said.
   So far, 32 former Nazis have been stripped of U.S. citizenship
and 27 have been deported, the Justice Department said. It said
more than 600 people remain under investigation by Sher's unit.

<TEXT>
   Libya on Wednesday asked for a Security
Council meeting in Geneva to oppose U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and to request that any forces there fly the U.N.
flag, U.N. officials said.
   A meeting has not yet been scheduled.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, said Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi wants the meeting to criticize the U.S.
military presence and quoted him as telling the agency:
   ``Any troops that are in the gulf that do not carry the banner
of the United Nations or that are not formed by the Security
Council and under its command are regarded as troops of colonialist
invasion and should be resisted.
   ``We reject individual attempts by some United Nations members
in a bid to control and practice hegemony.''
   Security Council officials confirmed that Libya sent a letter
but said the English-language text was not yet available.
   Security Council President Aurel Dragos Munteanu of Romania was
expected to discuss the request in informal consultations with
members.
   On Monday some Security Council members criticized the United
States, saying it acted hastily and should not unilaterally enforce
the U.N. embargo against Iraq _ imposed as punishment for Iraq's
Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait _without council approval.
   Envoys of Cuba, Canada, France and Malaysia said the best course
was to wait for the Security Council to evaluate the effectiveness
of sanctions on Iraq. The council next would decide whether to call
for a U.N. blockade of Iraq to enforce the sanctions, they said.
   The United States says its action is justified under a U.N.
Charter provision that calls for collective self-defense. It cites
a letter from the ousted government of Kuwait requesting U.S. aid
in enforcing sanctions on Iraq.

   Folks in this Army town know from
experience that something is up at Fort Hood. Soldiers are updating
wills and stockpiling desert gear. Rumors are flying.
   But the Pentagon and the post refuse to say whether any troops
have been or will be deployed to the Middle East.
   ``I can't speculate on that. We have no comment,'' said Fort
Hood spokesman Maj. Jesse Seigal on Tuesday.
   ``We simply haven't announced anything out of Fort Hood,'' a
Pentagon spokeswoman said.
   The post is the largest armored post in the U.S. and home of the
1st Cavalry and 2nd Armored divisions. The Associated Press has
quoted an Army source in Washington as saying troops from Fort Hood
would be deployed.
   The people of Killeen are sure that troops and equipment from
their neighboring post will be involved somehow in the the Persian
Gulf.
   ``There's something going on. You don't see any GI's downtown.
At lunch we usually have five or six, but I haven't seen a GI in 2
or 3 weeks,'' said Margaret Galindo, an employee at The German
Restaurant in Killeen.
   Almost 70,000 people live in Killeen, located at the main
entrance of Fort Hood. About 45,000 of them are military, their
families or military retirees.
   Bell County Justice of the Peace Robert Stubblefield said his
office has been inundated with calls from soldiers who want to
update their wills or designate power of attorney.
   ``Everybody kind of gets jittery and wants to get their stuff in
order,'' Stubblefield said.
   Others point to the run by soldiers on desert supplies at Army
surplus stores.
   The Fatigues and Things store was sold out of desert bandanas
and camouflage, said assistant manager Maryann Carrillo. Canteens
and desert goggles also were going fast.
   Much of that equipment is issued by the Army, but Ms. Carrillo
said soldiers are telling her the post is either out of the items,
or they're afraid they won't get them in time.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Mother Not to Smoke in Front of Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother has been ordered not to smoke
in front of her 5-year-old son by a judge hearing a child custody
dispute.
   Judge David Stirling issued the ruling Tuesday in Superior Court
when the boy's father, Manfred Kallweit, complained of health risks
associated with inhaling second-hand smoke.
   The mother, Anna Maria De Beni Souza, called the order crazy.
Terry Eagan, regional vice president for the Tobacco Institute and
Tobacco Action Network said he's ``never heard of anything like
this in any other part of the country.''
   Eagan said he would have the industry's lawyers investigate the
case. ``The first thing that comes to my mind is the privacy
issue,'' Eagan said.
   Kallweit, who has joint custody of the boy, asked the judge to
impose the order after De Beni Souza petitioned the court for sole
custody. The petition is pending.
   The ruling, which bans smoking ``in direct presence of child
within the home,'' will stay in effect until the boy turns 18 or a
higher judge overrules it.
   ``If this is a new wave, so be it,'' said Kallweit's lawyer,
Charles Asbury. ``I appreciate all the problems that cigarettes
pose in the world.
   ``The courts have regularly forbidden people to drink alcohol
and consume drugs in child custody cases, the reason being the risk
of harm to the child. Smoking poses the same risk of harm.''
   De Beni Souza said she's a light smoker who goes through a pack
of cigarettes in two or three days.
   ``What right does the court have to dictate my behavior in the
privacy of my own home?'' she said. ``This is not Russia, right?''

<HEAD>Buyers Flock To Love Canal Homes; State Refuses To Guarantee Them</HEAD>

   Home-seekers flocked to the
neighborhood surrounding the Love Canal toxic-waste dump Wednesday
as a state agency put nine houses up for sale but refused to
guarantee their safety in writing.
   ``The area's been real quiet. It'll be nice to get neighbors
back,'' said William Stevenson, one of about 70 people who stayed
in the neighborhood rather than accept a government buyout during
the late 1970s.
   But environmentalists and former neighborhood residents
denounced plans to resettle the area, which became a powerful
symbol of America's toxic waste problem when toxic chemical leaks
drove about 2,500 people away.
   ``I think there is a very real risk,'' said Rebecca Todd of the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   The Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency originally planned to
put 10 homes up for sale Wednesday, but one was snapped by a
resident of an area the government considers uninhabitable, agency
Executive Director William L. Broderick told a news conference.
   About 20 people visited the agency's sales office and another 10
called in the first four hours it was open, said Len Rinallo, the
agency's salesman. Rinallo said two people had already put down
$100 deposits on houses they want to buy when the rehabilitation is
finished.
   The homes are priced at $40,000 to $60,000, about 20 percent
less than comparable homes elsewhere. About 250 houses in the area
eventually will be sold.
   The agency also announced that it was renaming the neighborhood
Black Creek Village. The agency decided to borrow the name of a
tiny local creek to help erase the area's toxic-waste image, said
agency Planning Director James E. Carr.
   Love Canal gained notoriety after 22,000 tons of dioxin, PCBs
and other hazardous chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier by
Hooker Chemical Co. began leaking into a middle-class neighborhood
built on top of the dump.
   The 2,500 people fled their homes, and 240 houses and an
elementary school were demolished. More than 800 other homes have
stood vacant since then.
   The dump has been capped and a monitoring system installed, but
most of the chemicals remain buried beneath a 70-acre fenced-off
mound. The area chosen for resettlement is north and northwest of
the dump.
   State studies show that it is no more contaminated than
comparable neighborhoods elsewhere in Niagara Falls, agency
officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's probably the safest area in the city of Niagara Falls,
because we know the most about it,'' said Broderick.
   However, Broderick said the agency could not give any written
guarantees chemical leaks would not recur.
   ``All we have is the written assurance of the state health
department, the state environment department,'' he said. ``If there
is a problem in the future, I'm sure the state will come back and
do as they did last time.''
   Joseph E. Ceretto, a 28-year-old substitute teacher who
inspected some of the homes, said the lack of guarantees would not
deter him from buying one.
   He said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had deemed the
area habitable. ``With the continuous monitoring, I'll know what's
in my backyard,'' Ceretto said.
   Outside the house Ceretto wants to buy stood Luella Kenny, a
former resident whose 7-year-old son died of a kidney ailment she
blames on dioxin from the dump.
   She said she didn't trust the government's assurances.
   ``The government is fooling with people, just like they fooled
us 12 years ago, telling us everything was going to be all right,''
said Kenny, who now lives on nearby Grand Island.
   But other onlookers, such as the Stevenson and his wife,
Phyllis, said they never believed the danger was as great as
everyone feared.
   ``We raised a family, and they grew up and had children, and now
(the children) have children. They're all healthy,'' Mrs. Stevenson
said.
   Todd of the Natural Resources Defense Council confronted agency
officials at their news conference, then held one of her own across
the street.
   She said offering the homes for sale put the agency in contempt
of a 1985 court order. Her group and four others have asked a state
judge to enforce the order and block any sales.
   Agency lawer Paul Reid said the court order only barred the
sales until a habitability study and an environmental impact
statement were completed, and said those requirements had been met.

   Libya on Wednesday asked for a Security
Council meeting in Geneva to oppose U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and to request that any forces there fly the U.N.
flag, U.N. officials said.
   A meeting has not yet been scheduled.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, said Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi wants the meeting to criticize the U.S.
military presence and quoted him as telling the agency:
   ``Any troops that are in the gulf that do not carry the banner
of the United Nations or that are not formed by the Security
Council and under its command are regarded as troops of colonialist
invasion and should be resisted.
   ``We reject individual attempts by some United Nations members
in a bid to control and practice hegemony.''
   Security Council officials confirmed that Libya sent a letter
but said the English-language text was not yet available.
   Security Council President Aurel Dragos Munteanu of Romania was
expected to discuss the request in informal consultations with
members.
   On Monday some Security Council members criticized the United
States, saying it acted hastily and should not unilaterally enforce
the U.N. embargo against Iraq _ imposed as punishment for Iraq's
Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait _without council approval.
   Envoys of Cuba, Canada, France and Malaysia said the best course
was to wait for the Security Council to evaluate the effectiveness
of sanctions on Iraq. The council next would decide whether to call
for a U.N. blockade of Iraq to enforce the sanctions, they said.
   The United States says its action is justified under a U.N.
Charter provision that calls for collective self-defense. It cites
a letter from the ousted government of Kuwait requesting U.S. aid
in enforcing sanctions on Iraq.

   The Bush administration said Wednesday it has
asked Congress to clear the sale of 46 F-16 jet fighters and other
weaponry to Egypt.
   A Congressional source estimated the value of the package at
nearly $2 billion.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler called the
deal ``the final phase of a decade-long program to modernize and
westernize the Egyptian air force'' and said it was ``totally
unrelated to the current crisis'' in the Persian Gulf region.
   But, she said, ``As part of our response to the current Gulf
crisis, we will review requests from our friends for additional
arms sales on a case-by-case basis.''
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said he had hoped the administration
would use the Gulf crisis ``as a time to reevaluate a policy of
unrestrained arms sales to the region.''
   Levine, a member of the House Middle East subcommittee, said the
sales ``had the effect of making a tinderbox more volatile.''
   Egypt has played a leading role in the Arab world in supporting
the U.S. economic boycott of Iraq. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
also sent troops to Saudi Arabia to assist in the defense of the
oil fields should Iraq attack.
   Congress was notified informally of the sale last Thursday. This
started a 20-day period in which Congress has a chance to propose
changes in the package.
   Then, if both the House and Senate do not vote against the sale
within 30 days it goes through.
   There is no indication so far of congressional opposition. Egypt
is the only Arab country at peace with Israel. As a result, Israeli
governments have not objected to U.S. arms sales to Cairo.
   The administration also is preparing to ask Congress to clear
the sale of at least a dozen F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia. That
could get a far different reception on Capitol Hill.
   Supporters of Israel and members of Congress concerned about the
proliferation of arms in the Middle East or the possibility the
weapons could be captured by terrorists are apt to fight a Saudi
deal.
   On the other hand, the Bush administration probably will make
the argument that Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and threat to the
Saudi oilfields requires building up the Saudi arsenal.

<HEAD>Haiti's Council of State Passes No Confidence Vote on President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The Council of State said Wednesday
it had passed a vote of no confidence in President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, declaring her administration has become an
obstacle to holding free elections.
   General elections in this poor, violence-wracked Caribbean
country are scheduled for Nov. 4. But on Wednesday the Electoral
Council set up to oversee the voting pushed back the opening of
voter registration from Aug. 19 to Sept. 3.
   There has been much speculation that the Electoral Council will
have to postpone the elections.
   The 19-member Council of State, which rules alongside Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot, passed the no-confidence vote Tuesday. A
statement released Wednesday by the council did not indicate how
members voted.
   ``Having respected none of its commitments, the executive is no
longer able to win the confidence of the people and has become an
obstacle to the holding of genuine elections,'' the council
statement said.
   In passing its no-confidence vote, the council declared it was
impossible to collaborate with the government. But the council's
president, Dr. Louis Roy, told The Associated Press that council
will not resign.
   It was unclear what effect the no-confidence vote would have,
although it does not oblige Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot to resign.
   The vote was seen as a symbolic gesture to put pressure on Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot to abide by the joint governing agreement under
which the council was to have veto power over her Cabinet
appointments and major decisions.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's civilian caretaker government came to
power March 13, after a week-long popular uprising toppled military
ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, 46, a former Supreme Court justice,
became the first female president in Haiti's 186-year history.
   At the time, she agreed to govern alongside the Council of
State, whose members were appointed by civilian opposition leaders,
until after the country's first free elections could take place
later in the year.
   The council is comprised of representatives of civic
organizations and provincial districts.
   The conflict between the council and Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot came
to a head May 21, when the president appointed Marie Violene
Legagneur as finance minister without the council's authorization.
   Council members regarded Legagneur as a sympathizer of the
Duvalier family dictatorship of Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier,
who fled into exile in 1986, and of his late father, Francois
``Papa Doc.''
   Legagneur resigned a month later.
   Also in June, Council of State member Serge Villard was
assassinated by four gunmen, two of whom were dressed in army
uniforms.
   In a statement of Aug. 7, the council accused the government of
not pursuing the investigation of Villard's murder.
   Information Minister Carlo Desinor said last week that the
conflict between the council and the president stemmed from
``over-sensitivity _ personality not political differences.''
   But in Wednesday's statement, the council accused the president
of failing to implement the administrative, judicial, military and
economic reforms that were set down as prerequisites for genuine
elections when the caretaker government came to power.
   Haiti's last attempt at holding free elections ended in failure.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, thugs in collusion with the army killed at
least 34 voters at the polls, halting the first free general
elections in Haiti since independence from France in 1804.

   The Philippine government will sell an estimated
$10 million worth of Old Master paintings and a 100-piece silver
service acquired while Ferdinand Marcos was president.
   ``We appreciate fine art and we wish we could afford the luxury
of keeping these art pieces for ourselves,'' M.A.T. Caparas,
chairman of the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good
Government, said in a statement released Wednesday by Christie's,
the auctioneer.
   ``Our people, however, suffer from many needs that the proceeds
from these art works will help assauge. ... At least part of the
money from this sale will probably be directed to the relief of the
victims of our recent killer quake,'' said Caparas.
   The commission was created by President Corazon Aquino in
February 1986, primarily to recover wealth accumulated at the
expense of the government by Marcos, his relatives, subordinates
and close associates. Marcos was ousted in 1986 and died in Hawaii
last September.
   Dana Micucci, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said it was not
clear who acquired the silver and 70 paintings to be auctioned, or
where they were kept.
   The sale is planned for January.

<TEXT>
   RCA has released a ``new'' song by Elvis
Presley, a poignant ballad called ``My Happiness'' that had been
believed lost, an RCA executive said in the late singer's
birthplace.
   An 18-year-old Elvis recorded the song for his mother Gladys on
July 18, 1953, at the Memphis (Tenn.) Recording Service. The vanity
acetate disc, for which the singer paid $3.98, is thought to be
first recording by ``the King.''
   ``It could be called the underpinnings of rock 'n' roll _ it's
still blues and country,'' said Dan Wardell, national director of
catalog music for RCA. ``Some have described it as the birth of
rock 'n' roll.''
   ``My Happiness'' is the lead cut on RCA's just-released ``Elvis:
The Great Performances,'' a companion album to a two-volume music
video of the same name due out Friday from Buena Vista Video.
   Thursday is the 13th anniversary of Elvis' death on Aug. 16,
1977. He was 42 years old.
   The acetate disc had been in the possession of a high-school
chum of Presley; RCA obtained the license to the song.
   The song was snapped up immediately for radio airplay in the
United States and Europe, said Wardell.
   ``There's always extraordinary interest in anything having to do
with Elvis,'' he said. ``This is unusual because it was thought to
be lost for many years.''
   Wardell was a guest at welcoming ceremonies Saturday at the
Elvis Presley Birthplace and Park in Tupelo. The sentimental
strains of ``My Happiness'' _ ``How I long to be with you'' _
played over a speaker, giving the occasion a warm, ironic note.
   The disc reappeared in 1988, in the possession of retired
airline pilot Ed Leek, who attended high school with Presley.
   RCA was approached about it 18 months ago, Wardell said, and it
took that long to conclude arrangements for its release. Sun
Entertainment Corp. bought the rights to ``My Happiness'' from
Leek; RCA obtained a license to use the song from Sun Entertainment.
   Presley recorded another song on the other side of the disc _
``That's When Your Heartaches Begin'' _ and discussions about that
song are under way at Sun, Wardell said.
   That song needs a lot of restoration work, he said.
   However, there is some skepticism about ``Heartaches.'' An
expert hired by ``NBC Nightly News'' said the ``aural
fingerprints'' of a tape of the acetate didn't match a 1956 version
of the same song by Elvis.
   Wardell said, ``We have an affidavit from Marion Keisker, who
was a secretary at Memphis Recording Service that day. The Elvis
Presley Estate says it's authentic. We have no reason to doubt it's
the real thing.''

   Iraq will be allowed to participate in
an emergency OPEC meeting to make new price and production
decisions, Venezuela's acting foreign minister said Wednesday.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has not yet
announced a date and location for its meeting.
   ``Iraq is a member of OPEC, and has the right to participate in
any of its meetings,'' acting Foreign Minister Adolfo Raul
Taylhardat told reporters.
   He spoke in the presence of Iraq's ambassador to Venezuela,
Majid A. Al Samarra'i.
   The ambassador visited Taylhardat to clarify a government
version of comments he made Tuesday, which indicated that Iraq was
threatening OPEC not to raise production in the aftermath of the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces. The ambassador said he
made no such threat.
   Iraq, with the de facto annexation of Kuwait, controls about 20
percent of the world's oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said he hoped a pricing
decision would be made this week.

   The remains of a weakening tropical storm brought thunderstorms
and a threat of flash floods to the Southwest on Wednesday, and it
also rained across much of the Southeast.
   The same weather system pelted Southern California with hail and
heavy rain Tuesday.
   There were widely scattered showers and thunderstorms along the
western Gulf Coast, west Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and
Arizona.
   A flash flood watch was posted for parts of Texas, Nevada,
southern Utah, New Mexico and most of Arizona.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also developed along a front
curving from Missouri and Oklahoma through the central Gulf Coast
states to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   A few showers developed along a cold front in the upper Midwest
over central Michigan and east central Wisconsin.
   An upper-level weather disturbance crossing the northern Plateau
over eastern Washington state and northern Idaho produced a few
showers.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were mostly in the 80s and lower 90s from the
southern Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast Wednesday afternoon.
   Afternoon readings were in the 70s in the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeast.
   Clouds and rain kept temperatures relatively cool in the
Southwest. Readings in the normally torrid desert areas of southern
Arizona and southern California barely topped 90 degree mark at
midday.
   Seasonable temperatures prevailed over the Northwest.
   The low for the Lower 48 states Wednesday morning was 41 at
Warroad, Minn., and West Yellowstone, Mont.

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Calls for Changes in Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's advisory panel on the
treatment of cancer and AIDS proposed major changes Wednesday in
government testing of experimental drugs to speed them to patients
``for whom time is running out.''
   For patients who are not benefited by approved and readily
available medicines, ``still unproved therapies may represent their
only hope,'' the panel said in its final report.
   For patients who resist all available therapies, ``new
treatments on the cutting edge of science may represent the best
standard of care,'' it said.
   The President's Cancer Panel, chaired by industrialist Armand
Hammer, a physician by training, concluded that patients are
willing to accept the risks associated with new and untried
therapies.
   But it said they can become more widely available only if the
Food and Drug Administration, the agency charged with approving and
regulating medical therapies, ``can be allowed and is willing to
become more flexible in implementing such innovations'' for
patients ``for whom time is running out.''
   Activist groups representing AIDS and cancer patients also have
called for expediting and expanding use of experimental treatments.
   The panel made these recommendations and findings:
   _The secretary of health and human services should establish a
permanent policy and oversight committee to monitor the FDA's
regulation and approval of drugs and biologic therapies for human
use.
   _Expedited approval of cancer and AIDS drugs could result if the
FDA relied more frequently on the opinion of qualified experts
serving on agency advisory committees.
   _The FDA should consider modifying its current criteria for
approval of new drug applications. The present standard, proof of
improved survival, might well be changed to include complete or
partial positive responses in patients whose cancers have resisted
all current therapies.
   The panel said drugs that produce tumor regression in more than
20 percent or 30 percent of patients in approval trials should be
approved for marketing.
   _Congress should give prompt attention to FDA's inadequate
resources, staff and facilities.
   _FDA studies designed to determine if a drug under investigation
is superior to that of a prescription drug may no longer be
required for that drug to receive market approval.
   _The FDA's advisory committee system for human prescription
drugs should be fundamentally restructured with panels permitted to
bypass intermediate staff and report directly to the FDA
commissioner. The panels should have an independent staff and
control their own agendas and priorities.
   The panel also recommended that companies sponsoring
experimental drugs have the option of paying the FDA for outside
review of the applications by qualified and unbiased experts in
order to resolve the FDA's problem of increasing responsibilities
and decreasing staff.
   Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers should give identical
coverage for experimental drugs and all related medical care for
AIDS and cancer patients, the committee said.
   ``We endorse the development of community-based clinical trials
that permit widespread access to investigational drugs without
sacrificing statistical analysis of drug effectiveness and thus
that can lead to early regulatory approval,'' the panel said.
   Hammer said he hopes the report will prove useful in improving
the federal drug review process ``and in reducing delays in
marketing new drugs, thus benefiting cancer and AIDS patients
throughout the country.''
   The study was initiated in June 1988 at the request of President
Bush, then serving as vice president.

   An American mother and daughter were
killed when a suspected drug dealer commandeered the car they were
riding in, leading to a car chase and a gun battle with police, the
U.S. Embassy said Wednesday.
   Also in the car were the husband and three other children.
   The mother, Kimberley Hinkson, was 4{ months pregnant withsin Dennis
Hansen reported in Provo, Utah. Also
killed was her daughter, Courtney, 10, one of the six Hinkson
children, he said.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Adam Shub said
both mother and daughter apparently were killed by the gun
twins, her couman.
   An embassy statement said the incident took place Tuesday night
in Riyadh, the capital, and identified the man who seized the car
as a Saudi citizen.
   Family members in the United States said Kent Hinkson and his
family moved from Orange County, Calif., to Saudi Arabia eight
years ago and were scheduled to move back to the United States on
Aug. 29 and settle in Provo.
   Hansen said Mr. and Mrs. Hinkson and four of their children were
out for hamburgers when a man being pursued by police jumped in
their car and shot the daughter in the throat, killing her.
   During the chase that followed, Mrs. Hinkson was shot to death
and Kent Hinkson was wounded in the scalp, he reported.

   It's a tough place. Officials can
tell even Godzilla to get out of town.
   A 35-foot-high balloon rendition of Japan's cinematic monster
that was used to herald the opening of a new computer store will be
taken off his rooftop perch after a five-day stay.
   The city council in this San Francisco suburb decided three
years ago that such inflatables are tacky and limited merchants to
displaying them for just five days each quarter-year.
   Godzilla may be the first balloon in Walnut Creek since a
chicken was tethered to the top of a fast-food restaurant just
befor the ordinance passed, said Bill Englund, chairman of the
Design Review Commission.
   Heanac Chung, spokeswoman at the new ComputerCraft store, said
the balloon would be taken down and moved on to a new assignment.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Announces Travel Restrictions For Romanians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government imposed travel
restrictions on Romanian tourists after hundreds of Romanians were
turned back into Czechoslovakia by East German authorities, the
official CTK news agency said Wednesday.
   As of Monday, Romanian tourists traveling to Czechoslovakia will
have to show an official invitation, a voucher proving they have
paid for their stay, or a valid visa for a country of final
destination, CTK said.
   However, it said the measures ``do not mean cancellation of the
mutually agreed visa-free travel'' between the two countries.
   CTK said that starting Thursday, Romanian tourists going to East
Germany through Czechoslovakia must produce the required papers at
the Czechoslovak-Hungarian border or be turned back.
   The new regulations came after a growing number of Romanian
tourists sought to stay in Czechoslovakia after being denied
admission to East Germany.
   Romania has the weakest economy among the six Eastern European
countries which are trying to introduce market-oriented reforms.
   Many Romanians augment their incomes by buying products abroad
that are scarce at home and selling them on the black market,
leading Romanian authorities to impose stricter customs regulations.
   Thousands of others have sought to emigrate in hopes of finding
better living conditions and jobs.
   East German authorities now require Romanians to produce an
official invitiation or proof that they possess enough hard
currency to pay for their stay. Romanian visitors also must hold
round-trip tickets.
   East German border officials have turned back about 800
Romanians at the Czechoslovak border over the past few days. The
Mlada Fronta newspaper said most of those sent back were Romanian
Gypsies.

<HEAD>Panama Will Not Stop Iraqi, Kuwaiti Ships in Canal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panama said Wednesday it will
continue to allow Iraqi and Kuwaiti ships through the Panama Canal,
citing the 1977 treaties with the United States guaranteeing
neutral operation of the waterway.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panama is putting the Panama
Canal Treaties above all other international agreements, including
those under the U.N. Charter. Last week, the U.N. Security Council
imposed a mandatory economic embargo against Iraq for its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   According to the Panama Canal Commission, 27 Kuwaiti ships
passed through the canal last year. Only two ships flying the Iraqi
flag have made the passage in the last seven years, the commission
said.
   In an interview, Linares said the United Nations could have no
legal objection to Panama's decision to abide by the 1977 treaties.
   The 1977 agreement ``declares the neutrality of the Canal so
that, in times of peace as in times of war, it will remain secure
and open to the peaceful transit of the ships of all nations ... so
that the canal and the Isthmus of Panama will not be the target of
reprisals in any conflict between other nations of the world.''
   The Panama Canal Commission issued a brief statement Wednesday
saying ``there has been no change in current policy ... in respect
to the transit of ships through the Panama Canal.''
   President Guillermo Endara said that both the United States and
Panama agree that ``ships should be able to pass through the canal,
no matter what their nationality.''
   The United States and other Western nations have amassed a large
naval force in the Middle East to stop shipping into and out of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti ports.
   The Panama Canal Treaties call for control of the waterway to be
turned over to Panama at the turn of the century, with that nation
guaranteeing the neutral operation of the canal.
   In 1979, Panama took control from the United States of the Canal
Zone, which extends for five miles on either side of the waterway
between the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Senate candidate Josie Heath wasted no
time Wednesday launching her campaign against her GOP opponent,
U.S. Rep. Hank Brown, after defeating her opponent in the Colorado
primary election.
   Heath challenged Brown, who ran unopposed in Tuesday's primary,
to debates, and criticized his record in Congress on energy, the
environment and defense. She said the Nov. 6 general election was
``a referendum on the future of this country.''
   Brown spokeswoman Katy Atkinson responded that the congressman
in June had challenged the Democratic nominee to a series of seven
debates. ``What she said today was in response to his challenge
three months ago. We're glad she apparently has accepted,'' said
Atkinson.
   Meanwhile, state Republican Chairman Bruce Benson asked the
Federal Election Commission to investigate the Heath campaign's
failure to report 18 campaign contributions. The Heath campaign has
said the records of those contributions were lost due to a computer
glitch.
   Heath, a former Boulder County commissioner, defeated Alamosa
attorney Carlos Lucero in the Democratic primary. She received
115,935 votes, or 59 percent, to 82,044, or 41 percent, for Lucero.
   Heath and Brown, are vying for the seat held by U.S. Sen.
William Armstrong, who decided not to seek re-election after two
terms.
   In other action Wednesday, proponents of a major-league baseball
team in Denver pushed forward in their effort to obtain a National
League expansion franchise after area voters approved a .1 percent
sales tax to pay for a stadium.
   In other primaries Tuesday, Wayne Allard defeated Jim Brandon
for the GOP nomination for the 4th Congressional District seat
Brown gave up after 10 years to run for the Senate. Allard, a
veterinarian, outpolled Brandon 18,563 to 14,917, or 55 percent to
45 percent.
   The Democratic candidate in the general election is state Rep.
Dick Bond, who was unopposed Tuesday.
   The stadium-tax question won approval on a vote of 187,539 to
157,539, or 54 percent to 46 percent.
   The next step for baseball supporters would be to find local
business people interested in owning a Denver club. Gov. Roy Romer
and his three-member baseball task force met shortly after dawn
Wednesday to begin planning their strategy.
   William W. Fletcher, chairman of the board of the Rocky Mountain
News, said his newspaper is interested in a minority stake in a
team.

<HEAD>ABC News Chief Doubts Iraq Will Open TV Floodgates
^By JAY SHARBUTT

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Ted Koppel and CBS anchorman Dan Rather
have been allowed in Iraq, ABC News president Roone Arledge said
Wednesday he doubts this means a wave of other TV correspondents
will be allowed in.
   ``I don't get that sense and our people there don't get that
sense,'' said Arledge. He also said Iraq didn't seek out ABC to be
the first network: ``We just worked like hell to get in there.''
   He spoke a day after Koppel, anchor of ABC's ``Nightline,''
became the first U.S. network correspondent allowed in Iraq since
its Aug. 2 military takeover of Kuwait.
   Rather, who arrived Wednesday in Baghdad, filed his first
reports by phone because no TV satellite uplink was available, CBS
said.
   Koppel also had to do that Tuesday, but on Wednesday was able to
send via satellite a videotaped interview with Iraq foreign
minister Tariq Aziz.
   ``We are not going to yield to pressure. We are not going to
yield to this kind of intimidation,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz said Wednesday in a segment of the interview broadcast on
ABC's evening news. ``Iraq is not going to initiate a war.'' The
interview was carried on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Arledge, speaking at a press lunch, said he doubted any
correspondent, including Koppel, would be granted an interview with
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein simply because he rarely gives any.
   Hussein's only previous U.S. television interview was in July
with ABC's Diane Sawyer. However this time, Arledge, ``I don't
think anybody's going to get Hussein.''
   He said the Iraqis set no conditions in return for allowing
Koppel and an ABC team in, but have restricted what his camera
crews could shoot there, and once stopped him from taking a still
photograph on a street.
   He noted that similar restrictions apply in Saudi Arabia, which
is allied with the U.S. in opposing Iraq's takeover of Kuwait and
has allowed a large U.S. military buildup on its soil.
   Iraqi officials generally haven't limited Koppel's movements,
Arledge said, but made him leave a Baghdad hotel where 36 Americans
and two British citizens are being held. They were brought there
from Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion.
   Koppel began pressing for entry into Iraq last week when he
talked with the country's foreign minister after a news conference
in Cairo, and on Sunday got Jordan's King Hussein to intervene for
him, Arledge said.
   Before ABC could transmit from Iraqi TV facilities, it had to
get a waiver from the U.S. government and INTELSAT, the
international satellite cooperative, Arledge said.
   This was because payments for use of Iraq satellite facilities
are barred by the United Nations' economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Cable News Network and NBC still are trying to get
correspondents into Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Rebels evacuated most foreigners from
Monrovia's battlefront in an 18-vehicle convoy on Wednesday, but
prevented scores of Guineans and Nigerians from leaving.
   Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo, commander of a West African
peacekeeping force set to sail to Liberia, said a confrontation
with Charles Taylor's rebels while they were holding West Africans
could make his mission a disaster.
   President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, where some rebels say
they were trained, said he opposed the military intervention by
fellow West African leaders and warned of a possible ``spillover''
of Liberia's violent civil war.
   Insurgents of Taylor's National Patriotic Front invaded from
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to oust what they called the corrupt
government of President Samuel Doe. Fighting between Taylor, a
former Doe aide accused of embezzlement, and a splinter group led
by former army officer Prince Johnson has prolonged the conflict.
The fighting has killed 5,000 people, mostly civilians.
   Taylor had said he would allow the Nigerian and Guinean
embassies to evacuate personnel. But that was before both countries
sent soldiers to join the West African army. Taylor spokesman Tom
Woewiyu says Nigeria and Guinea, whose leaders are friends of Doe,
are trying to use the West African force as a cover to get troops
into Liberia to bolster the besieged president.
   Nigerian and Guinean troops are mobilizing in Freetown, capital
of neighboring Sierra Leone, with soldiers from Gambia, Ghana,
Sierra Leone and Togo forming a force to exceed 2,500 men. They
have orders to fight to force an end to the war.
   Taylor threatens to attack any foreign troops sent to Liberia.
He excludes 2,100 U.S. Marines on standby on warships off Monrovia
and in the capital itself evacuating Americans and some other
foreign nationals and protecting a skeleton embassy staff and U.S.
installations.
   Washington says it will not intervene militarily to end the
conflict.
   On Wednesday, Taylor's rebels escorted a convoy of foreigners
and Liberians from the West German, Moroccan and Egyptian embassies.
   West German Ambassador Juergen Gehl told reporters as he left
that 11 Germans, two Moroccan diplomats, the Egyptian ambassador,
four Lebanese and 24 Liberians were heading for neighboring Ivory
Coast.
   But about 60 Guineans, including the ambassador, were refused
permission to join the convoy, Gehl said.
   Other diplomats said about 1,400 people at the Nigerian Embassy
also had to stay behind.
   Hundreds of Guinean troops have massed with tanks on the border
with Liberia since Guinea accused Taylor rebels of making
cross-border raids and killing Liberian refugees of the Mandingo
tribe.
   The war has degenerated into a tribal conflict with rebels
killing civilians of Doe's Krahn tribe and Mandingos accused of
supporting him. Soldiers have slaughtered people of the Gio and
Mano tribes, to which most rebels belong.
   Compaore's warning that the conflict may spill over was
contained in a letter to Gambian leader Sir Dawda Jawara, head of a
Liberia mediation committee set up by the Economic Community of
West African States.
   Quainoo, commander of the multinational force, told reporters
Wednesday a cease-fire was a precondition for the kind of
peacekeeping operation he would like to command.
   He spoke before leaving Freetown for Banjul, the Gambian
capital, where Taylor has promised to meet Jawara to discuss the
war and his opposition to the intervention force.
   Doe's troops control a few square miles of Monrovia. Most of the
capital is in the hands of Johnson's men. Taylor's fighters hold
most of this country of 2.3 million people.
   In Washington, the State Department said U.S. forces off Liberia
evacuated a total of 314 people as of last Monday, most of them
Americans.

   The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and
seven ships of its battle group left East Coast ports Wednesday on
a quickly planned deployment to the Middle East.
   ``Please don't worry, we can take care of ourselves,'' Capt.
Henry C. Giffen III, commander of the guided missile cruiser USS
Thomas S. Gates, told well-wishers over the public address system
at the Norfolk Naval Base.
   ``The major challenge for the families has been getting ready
for this sudden deployment,'' said Capt. Tom Johnson, Atlantic
Fleet chaplain. ``The feelings will have to be dealt with when they
see an empty pier and the reality of the separation sets in.''
   In Georgia, wedding bells are ringing like crazy for soldiers
rushing to say ``I do'' in a marriage frenzy reminiscent of World
War II scenes.
   Jill Sweat, 23, of Hinesville, and 2nd Lt. Michael Vandenbos,
23, were among about 60 military couples who applied for marriage
licenses in the past few days.
   Vandenbos, a mortar platoon leader at Fort Stewart, is on alert
and must check in at the post periodically, even on Thursday, his
wedding night.
   ``When we first decided to do this it was such a disappointment
because we had planned this big wedding'' in December, said Ms.
Sweat, an Armstrong State College student. ``But now I realize that
I am not the only one who had to do this. I know of three other
couples who are getting married this week.''
   Meanwhile, Pentagon sources said 22 radar-evading F-117A stealth
fighters would leave for the Middle East on Thursday.
   One of the ships in the Kennedy battle group is the
guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts, which was crippled by a
mine in the Persian Gulf in 1988 while escorting a Kuwaiti oil
tanker. It headed to sea from Newport, R.I.
   The Kennedy battle group and its 9,000 men may be used to
relieve the Eisenhower battle group in the Red Sea, the Pentagon
announced Tuesday. Or, the Pentagon said, the Kennedy could be
added to the naval forces arrayed around the Middle East as part of
the ``Desert Shield'' operation to defend Saudi Arabia.
   In one of the many deployment moves Wednesday, soldiers and
helicopters from Fort Rucker's only combat unit, the 2nd Battalion
of the 229th Aviation Regiment, got a flag-waving send-off in
Alabama as they departed for an unspecified destination. And
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt approved the deployment of more than 130
members of the state's Air National Guard to the troubled region.
   Troops from Fort Bragg's 82nd Airborne Division boarded C-5
transport planes Wednesday at Pope Air Force Base, N.C., while
Marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C., prepared for deployment to the
Middle East on ships.
   Hundreds of people gathered along Interstate 75 in Tennessee to
cheer members of Ft. Campbell's 101st Airborne Division traveling
from the Kentucky base to Florida and then to Saudi Arabia.
   Some, displaying banners, lined up along highway overpasses,
while passing vehicles honked at the military caravan.
   ``My husband is in the reserves and, you know, do unto others as
you would have them do unto you,'' said Charlotte Brumley, who
spent her lunch hour in the 96-degree heat watching the Army trucks.
   At Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., more than 200 friends, relatives
and military personnel gathered Wednesday to honor the first
American serviceman to die in Saudi Arabia since President Bush
deployed U.S. troops there. Staff Sgt. John Campisi, 30, died
Sunday when he was hit by a truck.
   The Kennedy group will conduct previously planned training
operations off the Virginia coast for several days, according to
Navy officials, while awaiting a decision on where to send the
ships.
   Navy officials declined to say how long the ships might be at
sea. The ships are the second carrier battle group put to sea since
Iraq invaded Kuwait. Last week, the Saratoga battle group left from
Florida for the Mediterranean.
   The USS Independence and its battle group are stationed in the
Mideast and the Eisenhower group has moved from the Mediterranean
into the Red Sea.
   Besides the Kennedy and Gates, the guided missile cruisers USS
Mississippi and USS San Jacinto, and the combat stores ship USS
Sylvania left Norfolk on Wednesday.
   The Roberts and the fast combat support ship USS Seattle from
Earle, N.J., will join the carrier group at sea, said an Atlantic
Fleet spokeswoman, Lt. Cmdr. Carrie Hartshorne. The destroyer USS
Moosbrugger was scheduled to leave Charleston, S.C., on Thursday to
join the battle group.
   The Kennedy's departure is the second major force movement from
the Norfolk base this week.
   On Monday, the 13 ships of Amphibious Group Two began their
departures. The ships will pick up their Marine air and ground
troops at Morehead City, N.C., before heading for the Middle East.
   Also leaving Norfolk on Tuesday was the 1,000-bed Navy hospital
ship USS Comfort heading for the Middle East.
   On April 14, 1988, the Roberts hit an Iranian mine while
escorting a oil tanker in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq
war. The blast tore a 22- to 25-foot hole in its bottom, flooded
its engine room and set off a fire that took five hours to control.
Ten crewmen were injured, two critically. All have since recovered.
   The Roberts underwent several months of repairs at Bath Iron
Works in Portland, Maine, and returned to Newport in October 1989.

<TEXT>
   A retired Israeli army colonel helped
Colombian cocaine traffickers murder a presidential candidate whose
death set off a major crackdown on the Medellin drug cartel, the
secret police said Wednesday.
   The suspect, Yair Klein, was a ``mercenary, narco-terrorist
instructor and presumed accomplice'' in the murder last Aug. 18 of
Luis Carlos Galan, said a report by the Department of Adminstrative
Security, Colombia's secret police.
   At the time Galan was the leading presidential hopeful of the
ruling Liberal Party.
   His campaign manager, Cesar Gaviria, became the Liberal Party
candidate and won the presidential elections. He was inaugurated
Aug. 7.
   The killing of Galan led to a war between the government and the
Medellin cocaine cartel. Since the asssassination, drug traffickers
have killed more than 500 Colombians, police say.
   Galan's murder, the police report said, ``was part of a plot to
produce a situation of political chaos and government
instability.'' The plot's objective was to stop prosecution of drug
traffickers.
   Wednesday's report said the government has identified most of
the people involved in Galan's assassination. A previous government
inquiry found that Galan's murder was ordered by the Medellin
cartel.
   The investigation has so far implicated 19 people, including
Klein and cartel leaders Pablo Escobar and Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   Seven of the 19 have been arrested. Three others, including
Rodriguez Gacha, have been killed by the police. Escobar, the
cartel's leader, remains at large.
   Colombia's government has issued an arrest warrant for Klein for
allegedly training private armies working for drug traffickers.
   Klein is now in Israel. He has said he believed he had been
hired to train ranchers to defend themselves against leftist
guerrillas. He has denied any involvement with drug traffickers.
   The secret police report summarized the investigation of Galan's
murder. It said the weapons used to murder Galan where shipped from
Israel via the Caribbean island of Antigua.
   Klein coordinated the arms shipment, the report said.
   Galan was the first of three presidential candidates to be
assassinated during the 1989-90 electoral campaign.

   Emperor Akihito on Wednesday led the nation in
honoring the war dead with a minute of silence exactly 45 years
after his father broadcast the Japanese surrender that ended World
War II.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged Japan not to repeat ``the
tragedy of the war'' and pointedly did not visit a Shinto shrine
where many of Japan's war dead, including 14 convicted high-ranking
war criminals, are enshrined.
   This was to avoid offending nations that suffered from Japanese
aggression in World War II.
   Akihito, flanked by Empress Michiko, bowed deeply before a
wooden pillar that stood as a monument to the dead and a huge
display of white and yellow chrysanthemums. He prayed for world
peace during a memorial ceremony at the Budokan martial arts hall
near the Imperial Palace.
   About 7,600 survivors of Japan's war victims also participated
in the nationally televised ceremony.
   ``It is a very important task for each of us to establish
lasting peace in order not to repeat the tragedy of the war,''
Kaifu told the hushed crowd.
   Earlier in the day, all members of the Cabinet visited the
Yasukuni Shrine except Kaifu, the chief Cabinet secretary, and the
foreign minister.
   No prime minister since Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1985 has visited
the shrine in an official capacity. Nakasone discontinued the
visits because of opposition from China and other neighboring
nations.
   ``I think it is a natural expectation for the head of the state
to pay respect to those who are sent to a war ... and lost their
lives,'' said a disappointed Tsutomu Hata of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, who was among nearly 200 members of Parliament
who visited the shrine.
   About a dozen riot police vehicles surrounded the shrine to
prevent violence between small groups of demonstrating rightists
and leftists. Each group blared messages through loudspeakers that
were virtually impossible to understand because of the high volume.
   Police later reported that three undetonated bomb-like devices
were found around the television station that broadcast the
memorial ceremony.
   No group claimed responsibility for planting the devices,
officials said, but local media speculated that extremists who
oppose the monarchy may have been responsible.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Showa,
announced to a stunned nation Aug. 15, 1945, that Japan would
surrender to the Allies. The United States had just leveled the
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs.
   Akihito, who is Hirohito's son, led the minute of silence at
noon. It even interrupted action at the national high school
baseball tournament in Osaka, one of Japan's most popular sporting
events.
   ``I renew my deep sorrow when I think of many people who lost
their precious lives in the last war and their survivors. ... I
pray for further development of our country and for world peace
with all the people in this country, and I would like to present my
condolences from the bottom of my heart to those who died on the
battlefield and in the war,'' the emperor said.
   At a separate ceremony, Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako
Doi urged the government to admit Japan's responsibility as an
aggressor in World War II.
   Japan has been issuing stronger expressions of remorse for its
actions in Asia during the war.
   When South Korean President Roh Tae-woo visited this spring, for
example, Akihito acknowledged that Japan had caused the Korean
people a great deal of suffering.
   While the emperor did not explicitly apologize for Japanese
actions, Kaifu did.
   In the days leading up to the anniversary, newspapers have run
accounts from readers recalling the horrors of the atom bombings
and the hardships during the war. The English-language Japan Times
newspaper ran a series of accounts of atrocities during the war,
but most of the Japanese-language media still shy away from such
reports.

<TEXT>
   A Beirut newspaper said Thursday that
kidnappers were paid a $5.5 million ransom for freeing two Swiss
hostages. Officials in Switzerland, however, have denied making any
payoff.
   The conservative Al-Anwar daily, citing anonymous sources in the
southern city of Sidon, did not say who paid the ransom for freeing
Emanuel Christen and Elio Erriquez, kidnapped in October.
   In another development, Iran's deputy foreign minister Thursday
called for a goodwill gesture from the West to help gain the
release of other hostages in Lebanon, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   The Iranian agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Mahmoud Vaezi
told visiting Swiss envoy, Klaus Jacobi, the No. 2 official in the
Swiss Foreign Ministry, that a goodwill gesture by the West ``would
help materialize the freedom of all hostages, whether Iranian or
others,'' held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Switzerland represents American interests in Iran due to the
absence of formal Washington-Tehran ties, so Vaezi's call was
believed directed at the United States.
   In its report on the ransom, Al-Anwar said Erriquez's release
Monday was delayed for several hours because of the kidnappers'
last-minute effort to increase the ransom.
   ``The kidnappers insisted on collecting the full amount and that
the share of the third party which worked as a mediator be added to
the previous amount,'' the source said without further elaboration.
   Erriquez, 24, an orthopedic technician, was held by a group
calling itself Palestine Revolutionary Squads. Christen, 33, also
an orthopedic expert, was released six days earlier. Both worked
for the Red Cross in Lebanon.
   Al-Anwar said the kidnappers insisted on getting a lump sum and
not installments, which prolonged Erriquez' release to give time
for the mediators to contact the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the Swiss government. It did not elaborate.
   Both Swiss and Red Cross officials have denied making any deals
for the hostages' release.
   Fourteen Westerners, including six Americans, are believed held
hostage in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian extremists. Longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

   An army brigade and a team of world observers
took up positions outside Montreal before negotiations began
Wednesday to try to settle a land dispute that has led to an armed
standoff between police and Mohawks.
   With the observers in place, the way was cleared for provincial,
federal and Mohawk authorities to resume talks that were stalled
for a month. They arranged to meet at a hotel in Dorval on the west
island of Montreal.
   Chateauguay, a suburb south of Montreal on the edge of the
Kahnawake reserve, has become a flashpoint in the conflict. Mobs of
white youths have taken to the streets there the previous three
nights, hurling rocks and gasoline bombs at police.
   The suburb lost its main artery to Montreal with the blockade of
the Mercier Bridge, mounted by the Indians five weeks ago in
sympathy with fellow Mohawks of Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal.
   Police and natives have faced each other across barricades at
Oka since July 11, when a botched police raid on a Mohawk roadblock
claimed the life of a police officer. The roadblock was to halt the
planned expansion of a golf course onto territory the Indians say
is ancestral land.
   On Wednesday, jeeps, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying 2,629 soldiers of the 5th Canadian Mechanized Brigade
rolled into communities outside of Montreal. The troops moved from
their base at Valcartier, near Quebec City, at the request of
Premier Robert Bourassa.
   The maneuver also involved ambulances, a crane, earth-moving
vehicles and a dozen military helicopters.
   ``We are ready to react if asked to intervene,'' Maj. Serge
Quenneville said at a makeshift camp housing a battalion of
soldiers in St-Remi, nine miles south of Chateauguay.
   More troops and supplies were in place at a military base in
St-Hubert, south of Montreal, and Longue Pointe in Montreal's east
end.
   Eight observers attached to the Internation Federation of Human
Rights stationed themselves at Oka and Kahnawake.
   ``Since 6 a.m. today the observers have been at both places,''
said Louise Chicoine, an official of the Paris-based group. There
are 24 observers in all and they work eight-hour shifts.
   Under an agreement signed Tuesday by the negotiators, the
observers are to man eight positions between police and native
barricades at Oka and Kahnawake.
   In Quebec City, the province's chief negotiator, Alex Paterson,
said talks will aim at lifting the barricades.
   The stage was set for a return to the bargaining table when an
agreement was reached Sunday on preconditions, including the role
of the international observers and the free passage of provisions
and advisers into Mohawk-controlled zones.
   ``My mandate is pretty vague but it doesn't include native
rights or land claims,'' Paterson said. ``It is just to get rid of
the barricades.''
   On Wednesday, Mohawk leaders said they were anxious to begin
talks but they decried the military's stepped-up presence.
   Provincial and federal authorities say the army's role will be
peaceful.
   Quebec's public security minister, Sam Elkas, said Wednesday
said forcibly removing the Mohawk barricades ``would be the last
recourse and we want to avoid that.''

   In a bold stroke, Iraq's Saddam Hussein held out a hand of
friendship Wednesday to old enemy Iran, proposing a powerful
partnership against the Americans who are ``fishing in dirty
waters'' in the Persian Gulf.
   The Iranians sounded receptive to making peace with Iraq _ a
potentially troubling note for the U.S. military operation in the
Mideast. Iran's spiritual leader condemned the United States as a
``hellish'' power trying to dominate the region.
   Baghdad radio, meanwhile, said Arab and Palestinian groups were
forming in the region to launch suicide attacks on U.S. ships.
   In Washington, President Bush traveled across the Potomac to the
Pentagon, nerve center of the U.S. Mideast mission, and declared
that ``no one should doubt our staying power'' in confronting Iraqi
expansionism.
   The American ``way of life'' is threatened by Saddam's growing
control of the region's oil, the president told an assembly of
military men and women.
   Bush and Pentagon planners were considering escalating the U.S.
mobilization by calling up thousands of reservists to reinforce the
regular soldiers, sailors and airmen streaming into Saudi Arabia to
face off with the Iraqi army, which two weeks ago invaded and
occupied neighboring Kuwait.
   A fresh U.S. Navy battle group steamed from East Coast ports
toward the troubled Mideast, led by the aircraft carrier Kennedy.
   ``I really don't want him to go,'' one 15-year-old said of his
father, a petty officer on the Kennedy. But, the boy said, ``he
told me what was happening and explained why he had to go.''
   Some in the task force had first-hand knowledge of the gulf's
unseen dangers. In 1988, one of the vessels, the guided missile
frigate USS Roberts, was heavily damaged by an Iranian mine in the
gulf.
   As Saddam maneuvered and the Pentagon mobilized, immediate hopes
for a negotiated solution focused on Jordan's King Hussein, who
piloted his own plane to Washington late Tuesday, reportedly
bearing a private message for Bush from the Iraqi president.
   The royal mediator and the U.S. chief executive will meet
Thursday at Bush's oceanside retreat in Maine.
   Concerns heightened daily over the estimated 3,000 American
civilians trapped in Kuwait and Iraq. On Wednesday, Turks, Indians,
Iranians, Soviets and other foreigners were reported departing
Kuwait and Iraq _ or arrangements were announced for their
departure _ but the Americans were still barred from leaving and
looked increasingly like insurance for the Iraqis against attack.
   The Iraqis said they seized Kuwait on Aug. 2 to settle economic
and territorial grievances. They quickly ``annexed'' the small,
wealthy oil state.
   The U.N. Security Council has ordered a punitive trade embargo
against Iraq, and Bush has dispatched thousands of U.S. troops to
Saudi Arabia to defend that oil kingdom against a perceived threat
of Iraqi aggression, which he said would also threaten U.S. oil
supplies and the U.S. economy.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz accused the United States of
pushing through the embargo ``for the purpose of starving and
intimidating the people of Iraq, which is a proud people ... and
rejects humiliation and subjugation.''
   ``The Iraqi people, the Arab nation ... will reject by all
legitimate means the attempts of the United States to extend its
domination over the world by force, intimidation and deception,''
Aziz said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar. The text of the letter was released Wednesday.
   Under growing economic and military pressure, Saddam made a bold
move Wednesday, offering Iran favorable terms for final peace in
the devastating 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq.
   In a letter to Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Iraqi
president said his country, beginning Friday, would withdraw its
troops from Iranian territories occupied in the war and free the
tens of thousands of Iranian prisoners of war it has held, in
exchange for a peace treaty.
   Saddam called for ``a new life of cooperation'' between Iran and
Iraq, ``so we can deter all those fishing in dirty waters and
cooperate to turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign
fleets.''
   In Tehran, a spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security
Council said the proposal would be reviewed ``with optimism.'' The
Iranian foreign minister called the Iraqi concessions Iran's
``greatest victory.'' Iran's Cabinet met late Wednesday to consider
the plan.
   Although Tehran has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday directed new
bitterness toward the United States and the Saudi and other oil
autocracies in the region.
   Speaking to a religious audience, the Moslem cleric said foreign
powers were in the region only to fight ``over material interests
and resources.'' He said a ``hellish establishment'' was dominating
the world.
   If Saddam wins Iranian agreement, it would at least relieve the
military pressure on the Iraq-Iran border and allow him to divert
troops to his southern frontier with Saudi Arabia. At the most, a
deal might allow isolated Iraq to conduct trade through Iran and
give Saddam a potential military partner for harassing or
confronting U.S. forces in the region.
   In the face of international boycott, Iraq's main outlet now is
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba. But Bush is expected to press King
Hussein to close that seaport to Iraqi goods. Otherwise, the U.S.
Navy will probably set up a maritime cordon off Aqaba to block
Iraqi trade.
   Trucks, many with distictive yellow Iraqi license plates, on
Wednesday were seen streaming northward out of Aqaba on the road to
Amman, and presumably continuing hundreds of miles on the desert
highway to Baghdad.
   Said one official at an Aqaba port facility, ``They appear to be
in a hurry to get as much Iraq-bound cargo to that destination
before the sanction loophole at Aqaba is closed.''
   American and British warships maintained a close watch on sea
traffic Wednesday in the Persian Gulf. Radio monitors said the
British frigate HMS Jupiter, for example, called two or three
commercial ships in the morning to ask their destination and cargo.
   The U.S. Navy has massed 27 ships, including three carriers, in
the gulf, the nearby Arabian Sea and the Red Sea.
   ``We are not going to yield to pressure. We are not going to
yield to this kind of intimidation,'' Aziz, the Iraqi foreign
minister, said Wednesday in an interview with ABC News. ``Iraq is
not going to initiate a war.''
   However, Radio Baghdad, in a broadcast later Wednesday, said,
``Arab and Palestinian suicidal groups arrived in the gulf area and
said that they are ready to launch suicidal attacks against the
American ships which are imposing blockade against Iraq.'' The
broadcast, monitored in Washington on shortwave radio, gave no
details.
   The Bush administration asserts a right to ``interdict'' vessels
under the U.N. Security Council resolution ordering the anti-Iraq
economic sanctions. But even some U.S. allies disagree, saying the
council itself must approve a blockade.
   Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, backed down Tuesday
from previous government statements that three Australian warships
headed for the region would stop vessels violating the sanctions.
Instead, he said, the Australians would only interrogate and warn
such ships against breaking the embargo.
   The State Department, seeking to end such misunderstandings, has
been conferring with representatives of other major powers about
putting the Mideast naval forces under a U.N. flag or U.N. command.
   The Security Council may take up the issue after hearing a
report Friday on international compliance with the embargo.

   The vast majority of nations say they are
complying with a U.N. embargo on Iraq, but envoys of some poor
countries said Wednesday they may seek compensation from the world
body to offset financial losses.
   The U.N. ambassadors said no country has formally sought
assistance from the U.N. Security Coucil to make up for the loss
they incurred by joining the sanctions. However, they said
unofficial talks on the issue are under way.
   A U.N. committee is studying compliance of the 159 U.N. members
with the embargo. That body is to meet Friday, and a report is
expected later this month.
   Meanwhile, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called on Wednesday for
the Security Council to hold a meeting in Geneva to condemn U.S.
military intervention in the Persian Gulf in order to prevent a
``needless calamity.''
   U.N. officials said that so far no council meeting had been
scheduled and consultations on Gadhafi's request were expected.
   ``Any troops that are in the gulf that do not carry the banner
of the United Nations or that are not formed by the Security
Council and under its command are regarded as troops of colonialist
invasion and should be resisted,'' Gadhafi told the Libyan news
agency in a dispatch monitored in Rome.
   Virtually all envoys who have commented publicly stressed their
nations were honoring the sweeping sanctions.
   Jordanian diplomats declined comment, citing the delicacy of the
topic and the arrival of King Hussein to discuss the crisis
Thursday with President Bush. Jordan, which has close ties with
Iraq, has not put the sanctions into effect and has allowed
commercial traffic bound for Iraq to use its Red Sea port of Aqaba.
Bush has threatened to close that port.
   On Aug. 9, Bulgaria informed U.N. officials it was honoring the
embargo ``in spite of the serious difficulties that this would
create for the Bulgarian economy.''
   Ambassador Dimitar Kostova said in a letter that Bulgaria
reserves its right to address the Security Council under the U.N.
Charter.
   Under Charter Article 50, any state that faces special economic
problems because of Security Council enforcement action may consult
the Council about a solution. Relief is not specified but could
include exemption and appeals for compensation.
   The Council adopted mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq on
Aug. 6, banning all imports, exports and even indirect financial
dealings with Iraq and Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2. The
sanctions includes most food deliveries but exempt medical supplies
and, under special humanitarian circumstances, food.
   Ivan Sotirov, another Bulgarian U.N. envoy, emphasized Wednesday
that Bulgaria was ``living up to its commitment'' to observe the
quarantine. ``But we must admit, we feel the pinch,'' he said in an
interview.
   Bulgaria is a major transporter and transit point for commerce
between Europe and the gulf region. Iraq owes Bulgaria about $1.2
billion, Sotirov said.
   Iraq was paying Bulgaria mostly in oil deliveries, he said, and
this year Bulgaria stands to lose an estimated $140 million because
all commerce has stopped with Iraq and Kuwait. Bulgaria also has
doubled the price of gasoline because of the oil shortage, he said.
   Sri Lankan Ambassador Daya Perera said his government was also
supporting the embargo.
   But he added that Sri Lanka faces ``a tremendous hardship'' as a
result and may eventually seek U.N. relief. He said Iraq buys about
25 percent of Sri Lanka's tea and provides oil to his nation.

   Firefighters contained
several major forest fires Wednesday and experts said they were
confident the blazes will soon be fully controlled.
   Three big fires in Yosemite National Park were all expected to
be contained within lines of bare earth by Friday night, officials
said. The park was closed to visitors Aug. 9 because of the fire
danger.
   The park will be partly reopened Friday, officials announced. A
highway through the park across the Sierra Nevada range will be
opened, but Yosemite Valley, the main tourist destination, will
remain closed until at least Monday.
   For the third day in a row, fire bosses gave highest priority to
the Finley Lake fire in Tehama County in northern California, which
had burned 21,880 acres as of Wednesday and was 70 percent
contained. There was no estimate of when the fire burning 230 miles
northeast of San Francisco would be contained, said Dwayne Collier
of the California Department of Forestry.
   The Finley Lake fire, which threatened about 1,600 homes earlier
this week, was within four miles of the town of Manton but it
didn't appear to pose a threat, Collier said.
   Forest and range fires also burned in parts of Alaska, Arizona,
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon and Washington state, said the
National Fire Information Center in Boise, Idaho. So far this year,
the Boise Interagency Fire Center has shipped 1.9 million tons of
firefighting supplies at a cost of $11.3 million, officials said.
   In Yosemite, the A-Rock fire, which burned across 17,000 acres,
was 70 percent contained Wednesday and was expected to be fully
contained by Friday evening, said Collier.
   The Steamboat fire, which burned 4,400 acres and was 60 percent
contained, was expected to be fully contained by Thursday evening,
he said.
   The T-Grove 4 fire, covering 4,700 acres, was 90 percent
contained with full containment expected by Thursday night, Collier
said.
   Other small fires also burned in the 757,000-acre park, but none
on the valley floor where tourists congregate. A total of 22,100
acres in the park had been burned as of Wednesday, Collier said.
   The T-Grove 4 fire was less than two miles from Merced Grove, a
stand of ancient sequoia trees, but didn't pose an immediate threat
to the grove, Collier said.
   However, smaller trees burning along the park's roads might keep
the park closed, officials said.
   Burning trees were still toppling onto roads, said Janet Buzzini
of the U.S. Parks Service.
   ``We cannot open the park until we get those closest to the
roads down,'' she said, adding that falling rocks, crews and
equipment posed additional hazards. ``It's really not safe yet.''
   The first of 1,200 Army troops from the 4th Infantry Division in
Fort Carson, Colo., began arriving Tuesday to help with the Finley
fire.
   Tehama County, the Campbell complex fire _ the largest of the
siege of fires that spread across the northern part of the state
this month _ had burned across 115,000 acres and was 85 percent
contained Wednesday, Collier said.
   In the community of Foresta near Yosemite, 66 homes were burned
earlier this week.
   A total of 250,956 acres of California has been burned by an
estimated 1,300 wildfires since Aug. 3.

   President Bush authorized naval commanders to
use ``the minimum force necessary'' to interdict shipments to and
from Iraq, a senior administration source said Wednesday.
   The president's message was expected to be sent Thursday to the
U.S. Navy fleet in Middle East waters, the source said.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
instruction described a step-by-step approach under which
commanders should first request ships to halt and to seek their
cooperation before taking any more aggressive steps. Those steps
could include attempting to block the ship's passage or firing
warning shot across the bow.
   A minimum use of force might include steps taken to disable the
ship so that it couldn't continue on its way, the source said.
   ``It will tell them to use the minimum force necessary,'' said
the source.
   Ever since Bush has spoken of his barricade against Iraqi
commerce, administration officials have said they hoped the mere
threat of a possible confrontation would deter unarmed merchant
vessels from carrying Iraqi cargo.
   In a pep talk address at the Pentagon earlier Wednesday, Bush
vowed to use the massive infusion of U.S. military might in the
region to put a stranglehold around Iraq and force it to abandon
Kuwait.
   ``Together we must ensure that no goods get in and that not one
drop of oil gets out,'' he said.
   The source said the president had actually approved the minimum
use of force ``a couple of days ago'' but that the directive had
gone through a rigorous intra-agency approval process.
   Departments such as State and Commerce were brought into the
process because of the delicate nature involved in dealing with a
situation where shipments might be carried by ships flagged by
third countries.
   A preliminary message was sent out to commanders late Wednesday
but was pulled back for revision and the formal final directive was
scheduled to be sent to the fleet early Thursday, the source said.
The official did not define what the problem was, describing it
only as a minor glitch.
   Bush spent 90 minutes at the Pentagon getting an update on
Operation Desert Shield from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.
   The issue of a possible callup of the nation's reservists was
discussed but no decision has been made, the source said.
   Another matter still under study is the development of a joint
command for the tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers and their
international counterparts sent to Saudi Arabia to defend the
oil-rich kingdom from the threat of an attack by Iraq.
   ``There has been progress made, but we're not there yet on that
one,'' the source said.
   Underlining the president's words, the aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy and its eight-ship battle group left Norfolk, Va., for the
Middle East and Pentagon officials said aircraft leaving soon would
include F-117A stealth fighters.
   Defense Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 22 of the radar-evading fighters, which saw their first combat
in Panama last December, would leave for the Persian Gulf on
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the State Department said more than 2 million
foreigners, including about 3,000 Americans, were being kept from
leaving Iraq and the small nation it invaded two weeks ago. A
spokeswoman said Iraq had promised ``new guidelines'' on
foreigners' travel rights, but officials said privately they
doubted any changes would mean the Americans could leave.
   Noting that an Iraqi official had been quoted as referring to
the foreigners as ``restrictees,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said, ``Finally, they are admitting behavior that
is contrary to all international norms.'' However, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said merely, ``That's not an official
description and not what the government has told us.''
   Bush's remarks came one day before he was to meet with Jordan's
King Hussein, who has continued to allow supplies to flow into
Saddam Hussein's Iraq despite a United Nations trade embargo. The
king, who has put himself forward as a mediator in the crisis, was
said to be carrying a message from Saddam to the president's Maine
vacation home on Thursday.
   Fitzwater said the White House had no indication there was such
a message but was ``willing to listen'' to Hussein.
   The spokesman said Saddam's public peace overture toward
longtime adversary Iran ``doesn't appear to have any impact'' on
the Mideast crisis except as ``another effort to separate the
countries and create a diversion.''
   Bush also will meet with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince
Saud al-Faisal, and Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan on Thursday
following his talks with King Hussein, Fitzwater said Wednesday
night.
   ``The meeting will allow further consultations between the two
countries as agreed to by the president and King Fahd,'' the
spokesman said.
   Bush returned to Kennebunkport, Maine, shortly after his
Pentagon remarks, less than 24 hours after arriving in Washington
for meetings, a news conference and Wednesday's speech.
   The president also was expected to get cost estimates for the
huge operation and to discuss whether to call up the nation's armed
forces reserves and National Guard to bolster units depleted by the
Gulf crisis. Fitzwater said later that Cheney had not reached a
decision on the reserves.
   In his speech, Bush offered no new information on the questions
of how many U.S. troops will go to the Mideast and how long they
will stay. In the event full-scale conflict, the Pentagon has made
plans to ship up to 250,000 soldiers to the region.
   Defending his decision to dispatch tens of thousands of U.S.
combat troops and dozens of warships halfway around the globe, Bush
said nothing less than world order is at stake.
   Bush denounced what he called Saddam's ``raw territorial
ambition'' and attempts to portray the conflict as ``a holy war of
Arab against Infidel,'' a struggle between ``the haves and the
have-nots.''
   The president said the U.S. action was important to maintain
access to energy resources that are key to America's way of life
and to the world's economy.
   But he also said, ``We are striking a blow for the principle
that might does not make right. Kuwait is small. but one conquered
nation is one too many.''
   Calling once again for Iraq's immediate and complete withdrawal
from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait's government, and the
protection of all Americans caught up in the conflict, Bush warned
Saddam not to ``doubt our staying power or our determination.''
   As long as Iraq ignores the need for international order, Bush
said, ``peace and freedom are impossible. The rule of law gives way
to the law of the jungle.''
   ``It is Saddam who invaded an Arab state. It is Saddam who now
threatens the Arab nation,'' he said. ``We, by contrast, seek to
assist our Arab friends in their hour of need.''
   At the State Department, officials said Americans stuck in
Kuwait are running out of cash, and the U.S. Embassy has been
advancing some of them money.
   In Iraq, Ms. Tutwiler said, the 500 or so Americans are able to
move about _ but not to leave the country _ except for the 39 held
in a hotel in Baghdad.
   Again, she cautioned against their trying to leave either
country, saying that would entail ``serious risk.'' But she also
kept to the administration's stance that the Americans should not
be described as hostages.

   The Soviet Union prepared to evacuate its citizens from Iraq and
Kuwait and at least 3,600 foreigners reached Jordan overland from
Baghdad on Wednesday. Western governments demanded that Iraq grant
Westerners freedom to leave.
   About 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons, 500 Italians and more than
450 Japanese were stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2
million foreigners are in both countries.
   A Jordanian border official said at least 3,600 foreigners from
19 countries, including Poles, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and Somalis,
had crossed Wednesday evening at the Ruweishid border post, about
200 miles northeast of Amman.
   No North Americans, West Europeans or Japanese were among them,
said the official, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington that an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official informed a U.S.
diplomat in Baghdad on Tuesday that ``new guidelines'' were being
prepared governing travel rights for the stranded Americans, but no
new guidelines had been disclosed as of Wednesday. Privately, U.S.
officials said they doubted the rule changes would let Americans
leave.
   Iraq's ambassador to Greece, Abdel Fetah al-Khazreji, said
Tuesday in Athens that Americans and others could leave ``as soon
as the threats from the United States and its allies are
eliminated.'' ABC quoted a Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as
saying Americans in Iraq were ``restrictees'' who would stay until
the crisis was over.
   Ms. Tutwiler said, ``We have been telling you for days these
people are restricted from leaving. . . . Finally, . . . (the
Iraqis) are admitting behavior that is contrary to all
international norms.''
   The Americans were caught in the war of nerves. Although the
Americans were not being called hostages, U.S. officials suspected
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein might try to use them as
blackmail if his confrontation with the United States worsened.
   While most Westerners are free to travel around within Iraq and
Kuwait, one group of 36 Americans and two Britons has been
restricted to a luxury hotel in Baghdad, according to ABC News.
   An ABC correspondent said the detainees in the hotel are ``being
treated rather well,'' spending much of their day at the hotel
pool, but ``seem to be under enormous tension'' and are afraid they
will be stuck in Iraq until the crisis ends.
   Ms. Tutwiler said banks in Kuwait were still closed and the U.S.
Embassy was giving cash to stranded, strapped-for-money Americans.
   An estimated 500 Americans slipped out of Kuwait after the Aug.
2 Iraqi invasion. The State Department has been discouraging
Americans from trying to leave since British businessman Douglas
Thomas Croskery, 49, was shot to death while trying to flee into
Saudi Arabia on Saturday.
   In northern England, Croskery's widow, Thelma, 45, appealed to
Iraqi authorities to send her husband's body home for burial.
   ``Can they not realize that I am torturing myself that my
husband's body is lying in the sand for days and I want him home?''
she said.
   Iraq has agreed to allow all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but
only by a 1,200-mile road through Iraq to the Iraqi-Jordanian
border.
   All Soviet women, children and invalids will be permitted to
leave Iraq, but not Soviet men. Officials have not said how many of
the 9,000 Soviets in Iraq are men.
   There are 193 Soviet military advisers in Iraq.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the
first group of 230 evacuees were assembling in Baghdad on
Wednesday. He said intense desert heat and lack of transportation
hampered evacuation plans.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday accused Iraq of showing an
``absolute lack of respect for fundamental human rights'' by
refusing to say when it would let Westerners leave.
   It said European Community ambassadors to Iraq, including
Italy's envoy, met Wednesday with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in
Baghdad and asked that foreigners be allowed to depart but met with
a ``very disappointing'' response. In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry
said Iraq was asked to let Japanese nationals leave after six
Japanese were denied permission to go to Jordan.
   About 230 Japanese business people remained in Iraq, after all
Japanese on tourist visas were permitted to leave. The ministry
said the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait was sheltering 246 Japanese
citizens.

<HEAD>N.J. Governor Asks New Jersey Residents for Patience on Tax Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio on Wednesday night asked
state residents angered by higher taxes for patience, vowing in a
rare televised address that his plans would benefit many and keep
New Jersey's economy strong.
   Calling the $2.8 billion in tax increases a ``good investment
that will take time,'' Florio said it would ease skyrocketing
property taxes and improve schools.
   In his 25-minute speech, the governor acknowledged that his
popularity has waned because of the proposal, which prompted
several anti-tax campaigns by citizens groups.
   ``Would I like to be the most popular governor in the history of
New Jersey?'' Florio asked. ``Sure. Who wouldn't?
   ``But not if it means sacrificing the future for my
grandchildren. Not if it means losing the quality of life we
cherish in New Jersey,'' he said.
   The Democratic governor blasted his Republican predecessor,
Thomas H. Kean, for leaving a $600 million budget deficit that
Florio said made tax increases necessary.
   The governor, who requested the prime-time slot, spoke from the
studios of WWOR-TV in Secaucus across the Hudson River from New
York City. His speech was carried by television and radio stations
across New Jersey.
   In a Republican response to the governor's speech, Assembly
Minority Leader Chuck Haytaian appealed to the anti-tax groups,
saying the tax hikes will harm the state's economy.
   Haytaian said the increases ``insult the intelligence of New
Jerseyans,'' and have spawned ``New Jersey's summer of discontent.''
   Florio's popularity plummeted in a recent newspaper poll in what
experts said was a tax backlash.
   The governor's plan included raising the sales tax from 6
percent to 7 percent, and expanded to cover previously untaxed
products, including toilet paper. The sales tax and other levies
went into effect last month, and a higher income tax for about 17
percent of the state's residents takes effect next year.
   The new taxes will be used to close the deficit, pump more than
$1 billion in new money to schools and reduce property taxes. The
plan also includes a shifting of state dollars from richer school
districts to poorer ones.
   The new taxes, passed by a wary state Legislature in June, have
been sharply criticized.
   ``You've heard about the people going around, getting petitions
signed, demanding we undo what's just been done, before it even
gets a chance to work,'' Florio said. ``Well, I can't help feeling
most people are more patient. They have questions, not demands.
They're not yelling. They're more interested in answers than
confrontation.''
   Florio denied that he lied during last year's campaign when he
said he saw no need for new taxes.
   ``I believed we would have the surplus money Governor Kean said
we would,'' Florio said. ``I was wrong.''
   Florio said a $274 million surplus quickly became a $600 million
spending gap in the budget he inherited from Kean, forcing him to
make cuts in state departments and raise the sales taxes and levies
on liquor, cigarettes and oil.
   Haytaian blasted the tax plan as one that will hurt many
residents, particularly middle-class homeowners in rich areas that
stand to lose education dollars.
   ``The grassroots tax revolt that is sweeping our state was born
out of the anger and frustration of yet another political promise
broken and yet another political promise for property tax relief,''
he said.

   Radical students hurling firebombs and
shouting anti-American slogans attacked a U.S. Army facility
Thursday near downtown Seoul, police and officials said.
   ``We oppose the U.S. and demand unification of the fatherland!''
yelled about 60 radicals who tossed firebombs at the U.S. Army's
Corps of Engineers building, witnesses said.
   On Wednesday, thousands of leftist students clashed with riot
police who blocked them from marching to the border for a
unification rally. Police said 350 people were arrested and more
than 100 others hurt.
   But about 2,000 people were allowed to rally peacefully near the
heavily fortified border with Communist North Korea. They were
protesting what they said was the North's unwillingness to allow
them to visit relatives in North Korea.
   The protests overshadowed what would have been a festive mood
for the 45th anniversary Wednesday of Korea's liberation from
Japanese colonial rule. The holiday is observed in both Koreas.
   In Thursday's incident, students pelted riot police with
firebombs as they fled, police said. One student was arrested, they
said.
   It was not known how many people were inside the building at the
time of Thursday's attack, but a spokesman for the U.S. 8th Army
said there were no injuries and no significant damage.
   The leftist rally at Seoul's Yonsei University turned violent as
some 10,000 student radicals and dissidents, throwing rocks and
firebombs, tried to march off campus to go to the border.
   About 2,000 riot police, backed by a dozen armored vans equipped
with tear gas launchers, blocked all entrances to the school.
   Police said about 350 people were arrested and more than 100
injured in the two-hour clash at Yonsei and in protests in other
parts of the capital.
   The protests were limited to a section of the capital and along
the main highway to Panmunjom, a border village 35 miles north of
Seoul where the pro-unification rally was to be held.
   The border village is off-limits to civilians and no one can
enter the area without the approval of the two Korean governments.
   Authorities deployed 16,000 police in Seoul and along the main
highway leading to Panmunjom, the destination of the march.
   ``Let's drive out U.S. imperialists!'' radical students chanted
as riot police blocked their march.
   Protesters demand the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense treaty be withdrawn immediately. They
claim the U.S. military presence hinders dialogue with North Korea.
   ``Kill me!'' one student shouted, ramming against shields held
by riot police in front of her. Police kicked and punched some
arrested students.
   Under a South Korean proposal, the 155-mile border was to have
opened for five days beginning Monday. The opening has not taken
place because both sides failed to agree on conditions.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
peninsula in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.
The border is heavily fortified and there is no mail or other forms
of regular communication between the two sides.
   In Seoul, President Roh Tae-woo indicated that the government
may offer another temporary border opening around Chusok, the
Korean thanksgiving day, which falls on Oct. 3.
   ``Free travel between the South and the North is an
indispensable step toward unification,'' Roh said.
   He also called for talks with North Korea on pending issues such
as arms control and the establishment of permanent representative
missions in the Korean capitals.

   Iraq's Saddam Hussein, in a move that
could free military manpower and ease the stranglehold of economic
sanctions, offered Wednesday to make peace with his longtime enemy,
Iran.
   Iran greeted the proposal ``with optimism'' but said a thorough
study was needed. That country's Islamic Republic News Agency said
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his Cabinet were meeting to
discuss the proposal.
   Iran and Iraq never formally settled their eight-year war,
although it ended with a cease-fire in August 1988.
   In his proposal, the Iraqi leader said he would pull troops out
of territories seized from Iran and free Iranian prisoners of war.
He also suggested he was relinquishing the Iraqi claim to full
control of the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway to the Persian Gulf.
   Those were major points of disagreement that stalled peace talks
almost from the time they began, five days after the 1988
cease-fire.
   In addition, Iraq allowed Iranians trapped by the invasion of
Kuwait to leave. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
the first of the estimated 100,000 Iranians in Kuwait arrived in
Iran on Wednesday.
   The Iraqi president outlined his peace proposal in a letter to
Rafsanjani. A broadcaster read it over Baghdad radio, which was
monitored in Nicosia.
   Saddam indirectly called for an alliance with Tehran against the
United States, saying the Persian Gulf should be ``a lake of peace
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions
against us.''
   The Iraqi president said he was ``looking forward to a new life
of cooperation on the principles of Islam and respect of each
other's rights.''
   Iran has denounced Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait, but it has
also criticized the buildup of thousands of Western troops in Saudi
Arabia to deter any Iraqi attack.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated
criticism Wednesday of ``any sort of aggression in the region'' and
said Iran considers ``the presence of American forces in Saudi
Arabia ... to the detriment of Islam and Moslems and against the
Islamic revolution.''
   His remarks were carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia, before the Baghdad announcement.
   Iran's press trumpeted Saddam's proposals with large headlines,
but one newspaper cautioned that Iran should not become more
embroiled in the gulf conflict.
   ``Peace between two regional powers is certainly conducive to
peace, stability and security for the whole region,'' said the
English-language Tehran Times in an editorial made available in
advance of publication Thursday.
   But the paper, which often reflects Rafsanjani's thinking, said
Iran's leaders ``should not allow the country to get involved in a
crisis that might prove detrimental to our own national interest
and security.''
   Saddam said the troop withdrawal and the prisoner release would
start Friday. He did not specify the size of the territory from
which his troops would withdraw, and the number of Iraqi troops
involved was not known.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent a message to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asking him to instruct
the head of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group to cooperate
with Iraqi authorities in the troop withdrawal, Iraqi national
radio said Wednesday.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 772 square miles of territory occupied in
the final weeks of the war. The United Nations says the area is
half that size.
   In any event, a peace treaty with Tehran would ease pressure on
Saddam to defend the 730-mile frontier with Iran, Iraq's longest
border.
   Saddam could also be hoping Tehran would break with the rest of
Iraq's neighbors and allow food and other goods to pass through
Iranian territory to Iraq.
   But Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations,
said Tehran remained opposed to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and
would continue to abide by U.N. economic sanctions.
   ``We cannot accept aggression against another Islamic country
and annexation of that country to another country,'' Kharrazi told
the BBC.
   ``The settlement of the dispute between Iran and Iraq does not
necessarily mean any sort of support or so-called help toward that
country. ... Certainly we have our principles and we are committed
to the resolutions adopted by the Security Council,'' he said.
   Even if Iran formally maintained an embargo, a relaxation of
military strength on the border would be a bonanza for smugglers.
   The Iraqi president said he wanted to settle the dispute over a
1975 treaty that divided the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms
the gulf border between the nations.
   Saddam abrogated the treaty before invading Iran in September
1980 and had claimed full control of the Shatt al-Arab as one of
the main fruits of the war. It remains closed to shipping.
   Iran immediately interpreted Saddam's announcement Wednesday as
dropping the claim to the full waterway. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, speaking on Tehran Radio, called it ``the greatest
victory of the Islamic Republic of Iran in its history.''
   As for prisoners of war, the Red Cross has registered 50,000
prisoners held by Iran and 19,000 Iranians in Iraqi hands. But
United Nations and other officials have estimated the total number
at 100,000, some of them held since the early days of the war.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross headquarters in
Geneva said Iraq had asked it to handle the repatriation, beginning
with 2,000 Friday.

   Three former Northwest Airlines pilots used
an ``Alice In Wonderland'' defense at their trial on charges they
flew while drunk, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday in closing
arguments.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega said the defense
attempted to make a routine flight look difficult and at one point
contended it was easier to fly during an emergency.
   She said the pilots also told of being sober when common sense
and blood-alcohol tests showed obvious impairment.
   ``It tells you a lot about the defense in this case. It sounds
like Alice in Wonderland,'' de la Vega told the U.S. District Court
jury. ``They say it's hard to fly if it's easy, but it's easy to
fly if it's an emergency.''
   William Mauzy, attorney for First Officer Robert Kirchner, said
in his closing argument that de la Vega had no evidence of alcohol
impairment and that her case was an appeal to public fears about
flying with drunken pilots.
   ``What we have in this case is Stealth impairment,'' Mauzy said,
``impairment that hasn't been detected.''
   Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; Captain Norman Lyle
Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; and Flight Engineer Joseph Balzer, 35,
of Antioch, Tenn., have been on trial since July 25 on charges of
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.
   If convicted, each man faces up to 15 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   The three were arrested after their March 8 flight from Fargo,
N.D., to Minneapolis. In tests about two hours after the flight,
Kirchner's blood-alcohol was 0.06 percent; Balzer's 0.08 percent;
and Prouse 0.13 percent. In many states the legal limit for driving
a car is 0.10 percent.
   The case marks the U.S. Justice Department's first prosecution
under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a common carrier
while under the influence.
   The law doesn't specify an illegal blood-alcohol content. To
find the aviators guilty, jurors must conclude they were impaired
by alcohol even though there were no problems with the flight.
   Judge James Rosenbaum said he would instruct the jury Thursday
after Balzer's attorney, Bruce Hanley, gives his closing argument.
De la Vega said she would present a rebuttal closing argument.
   Prouse's attorney, Peter Wold, maintained that his client, an
alcoholic, has a stiff tolerance to alcohol from 35 years of
drinking.
   ``It's not hocus-pocus to suggest there are different tolerances
for alcohol,'' Wold said.
   Proving impairment doesn't require proof that the pilots were
staggering or that the flight was flawed, de la Vega said. The law
only requires that she prove the pilots did not have the
``clearness of intellect and control that they otherwise would
have,'' she said.
   Mauzy said, ``What's going on here is an appeal to fear. It's a
scary thought to think that a pilot with a little alcohol in his
blood would go flying.''
   But while the public may think its unsafe for pilots to drink
the night before a flight, Mauzy said, it's not against the law.
   There is an FAA prohibition against flying within eight hours of
drinking, but the pilots are not on trial for that. Kirchner and
Balzer said they did not break the rule, but all three were fired
for violating Northwest's 12-hour prohibition against drinking
before flying.

<BYLINE>Cable Networks Mostly Avoid Networks' September
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Come September, the networks' annual banzai
charge of new and returning shows will begin in earnest, with 35
new series on tap. But don't expect a counterbarrage then of new
shows from cable TV.
   Although cable now is plugged into 58.6 percent of the nation's
households and at least five new cable series will arrive next
month, cable networks still generally avoid the September rush.
   The idea, say cable executives, is to avoid getting stomped by
the megabuck ``watch-us'' campaigns of ABC, CBS and NBC.
   ``That is the primary reason for us,'' says Kay Koplovitz,
president of USA Network, a cable heavyweight with nearly 53
million subscribers. ``We feel that we're more competitive
introducing series at different times of the year.''
   Although the fall campaigns of the Big Three have become more
frenzied in recent years as audiences defect to cable and
independent stations, cable's annual ``watch-us'' campaign still is
held in April.
   Unlike the networks' big month, April is more a display of what
cable has to offer than the premiere month for a flood of new
series.
   ``Cable launches new programs all year around,'' says Turner
Entertainment Networks President Gerry Hogan, sounding the
traditional slogan of his industry.
   And instead of cable eventually joining the September Stomp, ``I
think it'll change the other way,'' says Hogan, who runs Ted
Turner's TNT network and TBS SuperStation network.
   ``I think the networks are going to recognize that what we do is
more correct in the current television environment,'' Hogan says.
   Even though viewing levels are lowest in the summertime, cable
programmers at times premiere new shows then, the idea being to
offer an alternative to network reruns, busted pilots and a few
awful summer series.
   Last month, for example, the extra-fee Home Box Office service
offered a sitcom, ``Dream On,'' and the USA Network began
``Counterstrike,'' an action-adventure epic co-starring Christopher
Plummer in his first series.
   But some of the larger cable networks now appear to be gradually
edging into the fall fray with a mix of new series and former
network series that in pre-cable days would have been syndicated to
local TV stations.
   Example: On Sept. 7, the USA Network starts a new half-hour
fantasy series, ``Swamp Thing,'' adding that to new episodes of
three other existing made-for-USA series, including
``Counterstrike.'' Another newcomer, ``Uncle Pooch,'' about a
talking dog, is due in October.
   But USA also has some potent Old Reliables from the networks,
too, arriving in September.
   On Monday, Sept. 17, the unofficial start date of the new TV
season, it will start Monday-through-Friday repeats of
``MacGyver.'' Later in the month, it will add repeats of ``Just The
Ten of Us'' to its current rerun roster of ``Crime Story,'' ``Miami
Vice,'' ``The Equalizer'' and ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   On Sept. 3, the Lifetime cable network, targeted at women and in
49.7 million homes, will premiere an ambitious double-barrelled
project that will be seen Monday through Friday evenings.
   Its weeknights will start with the one-hour, Canadian-built
``E.N.G.,'' which, like CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' and new ``WIOU''
series, has a TV newsroom setting. ``E.N.G.,'' which takes the
drama of news seriously, will be followed by repeats of NBC's
``L.A. Law.''
   Those who denounced CBS for axing ``Beauty and the Beast''
probably will cheer the Family Channel next month. It will run its
first repeat of the series Sept. 7 and start the show's weekly run
Sept. 21.
   But the Family Channel, serving nearly 53 million homes, also
has three new series arriving in September, the most of any cable
network.
   Two are sitcoms, ``Maniac Mansion,'' and ``Big Brother Jake.''
The latter features Jake Steinfeld, body-builder to the stars, in
his acting debut. He plays a Hollywood stuntman who returns to the
old neighborhood in Brooklyn to care for a group of foster children.
   Old pro Mickey Rooney, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1979 as
the trainer in ``The Black Stallion,'' will reprise that role in
the third new series, ``The Adventures of the Black Stallion.''
   The Family Channel also next month is bringing back three other
series it premiered in past seasons _ ``Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop,''
``Bordertown'' and the new version of ``Zorro.''
   On the news front, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network will
premiere on Sept. 20 a new, British-made current events series,
``World in Action,'' hosted for American viewers by Bill Kurtis,
former anchor of the ``CBS Morning News.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   DEPT. OF WHEN WILL IT STOP?: Effective Aug. 27, the number of TV
households in the U.S. will be 93.1 million, according to A.C.
Nielsen estimates. That's up one million from 1989-90, and 19.5
million more than in the halcyon season of 1979-80.

<HEAD>A ``Boring'' Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An indicator of smaller business optimism has
fallen to its lowest level since 1982, suggesting the economy isn't
likely to regain strength before the end of the year.
   The indicator, an index based on analysis of more than 2,000
responses from members of the National Federation of Independent
Business, was completed before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Developments in the Mideast will undoubtedly increase
uncertainty,'' said William Dunkelberg, who interprets the results.
Dunkelberg, an economist, is dean of Temple University's school of
business and management.
   He said the deterioration in confidence reflects an economy that
``is going down, at least for the count of 2 or 3,'' but that no
particular aspect of the economic situation could be blamed more
than another.
   Rather, said Dunkelberg, ``each index component continued to
reflect the slow deterioration apparent in the data for some
time,'' an erosion he describes as slow motion.
   The index, begun by Dunkelberg in 1974, is based on detailed
responses regarding expected business conditions, climate for
expansion, sales volume, credit conditions, job openings, capital
outlays, inventories, hiring and more.
   These responses are formulated into the index, which ranks 1978
conditions as 100. It fell to a seasonally adjusted all-time low of
81.1 in the second quarter of 1980 and reached its high of 108.7 in
1984's first quarter.
   The latest reading of 98.2 for the third quarter 1990, down from
100.8 in the second quarter, was the lowest since 95.3 was recorded
in the third quarter of 1982. Shortly thereafter the index ascended
into 100-plus levels.
   While the index is valued as a measurement of private-sector
strength or weakness, it is watched also because of its fairly
accurate record in forecasting future economic conditions.
   Based on responses to the latest survey, Dunkelberg believes the
inflation outlook may continue to improve, that pressure from labor
costs may ease and that the jobless rate likely will edge up as the
year ends.
   Still, he believes inflation fears will prevent the Federal
Reserve from any major easing of credit conditions. At best, he
suggests, the Fed will make ``ease noises'' rather than take strong
action.
   The companies on which Dunkelberg's analyses are based, all
members of the National Federation, range from very small companies
_ proprietorships and the like _ to companies with annual sales of
more than $100 million.
   None of these companies would qualify by size for lists of the
1,000 largest companies, which generally are said to constitute
``big business.'' Broadly categorized, therefore, they are
``small.''
   The community they represent, the federation says, involves a
vast and varied number of companies employing about one-half the
nation's private, non-farm work forces and producing about 50
percent of gross national product.
   As such, says Dunkelberg, they provide a grass-roots view of
attitudes and experiences that add up to an accurate picture of
present conditions and an indication of what lies ahead
economically.
   While reminding people that the survey was conducted shortly
before the latest oil problems, he doesn't foresee dramatic changes
ahead.
   ``The expansion was not characterized by any extremes, and it is
consequently likely that the slowdown that follows will be equally
boring,'' he said.

<HEAD>Travel Agents Say Book Air Fares Now Because of Fuel Uncertainty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deciphering airline fares never has been easy
for passengers, and the latest gyrations caused by the rising cost
of oil are making the picture more frustrating than a rush-hour
runway backup.
   That's why many travel agents have started urging clients to
book flights several months ahead of time, fearing that airlines
inevitably will push fares higher to compensate for an enormous
jump in jet fuel prices.
   ``I'm writing tickets for February, March and April,'' said Ben
Chanowitz, an agent at Travel Magic, a Manhattan travel agency.
``We're recommending that people lock in now.''
   Even for veteran air passengers, the past week has been one of
the more confused periods in the economics of air fares, a
convoluted science crammed with fine-print limitations.
   First, most airlines announced fare increases of more than 5
percent to defray unexpected increases in jet fuel prices caused by
the crisis in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
   But on Monday, Eastern Airlines and Trans World Airlines, two of
the most financially weak carriers, cut certain fares by up to 40
percent to stimulate sales. Competitors matched them.
   Then on Tuesday, all major airlines delayed fuel surcharges by a
week, evidently out of partial fear that they could discourage
would-be travelers from flying.
   The net result is an atmosphere of uncertainty that is
convincing a growing number of travelers to postpone plans or buy
tickets now for Thanksgiving, Christmas and beyond, travel agents
said.
   ``We are encouraging people to buy whatever is available at the
moment,'' said Juergen Krenzien, president of Paul Klein Travel
Service in Chicago. ``Our feeling is fares aren't going down.
They're going to go up.''
   Others said it was a good idea to buy tickets now even if prices
decline over the next few months, because generally airlines will
reissue the same tickets at the lower fare and refund the
difference to the buyers.
   But that generalization is loaded with some important
exceptions, especially in the case of discounted advance-purchase
tickets that in many cases are non-refundable.
   The widely accepted rule is that airlines will only exchange the
more expensive ticket for the cheaper one if the class of ticket is
identical and the itinerary remains unchanged.
   ``Say you're holding a non-refundable ticket for $200 and a
lower fare is introduced at $150. All you do is contact a travel
agent and you may switch to the lower fare,'' said Jackie Pate, a
spokeswoman for Delta Air Lines.
   ``But there are conditions,'' she said. ``You can't change the
flight or date. If you were holding the 7-day advance purchase
non-refundable and the new fare is a 14-day non-refundable, then
you may not be able to switch.''
   Even with all the airfare uncertainty, many travel agents say
some good bargains are likely to endure, especially going into the
fall travel season that historically is one of the year's slowest
periods.
   For example, one of the most popular discounts, a 14-day
advance-purchase non-refundable ticket, still offers a 40 percent
discount off the peak price. However, it's generally only good for
Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday travel.
   Moreover, if you're a senior citizen, you can get some of the
best discounts, because airlines and hotels have targeted people in
their 60s as one of their most lucrative untapped markets. Some
airlines offer packages to seniors that save hundreds of dollars on
tickets, with few limitations.
   Some travel experts are even predicting airlines will be forced
to lower fares. They speculate carriers might face a passenger
boycott if they hike prices substantially to defray jet fuel costs,
which have jumped 25 percent and more since Iraq seized Kuwait Aug.
2 and provoked world fear of an oil shortage.
   ``The airlines have panicked over the fuel situation,'' said
Eric Munro, chief executive officer of the San Diego office of
Uniglobe Worldwide Travel. ``But people are going to refuse to fly,
let's face it.''
   Others said it was more likely that the airlines eventually will
seek to minimize any fuel-related increases and that many travelers
probably wouldn't notice the rise in cost.
   ``Ten or 15 bucks just isn't going to make any difference for a
bunch of people,'' said Herbert Teison, editor of the newsletter
Travel Smart for Business.

   An art expert says stolen German treasures stored
at Dallas Museum of Art rank among the world's rarest and most
important religious artifacts.
   One of the treasures may contain material linked to the Virgin
Mary, said Dietrich Koetzche of the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin.
   He visited Dallas to study the relics for a German church that
claims to own them. They were believed to have been taken from a
mine shaft at Quedlinburg, East Germany, near the end of World War
II by a soldier from Texas.
   The objects ``rank among the three most significant medieval
church treasures in Germany,'' he told the Dallas Times Herald. Joe
Meador, the soldier, died in 1980, leaving the art to his brother
and sister. It later was turned over to the museum.
   Officials say most of the treasures were reliquaries or
containers used to hold relics. Koetzche said he believes some
small reliquaries hold items belonging to the Virgin Mary, possibly
including a lock of her hair.

   Appealing to alienated Roman Catholics to

   ``Too many alienated Catholics have heard only the voice of

   The ads, inviting telephone calls and participation in group
sessions, stress the gentler, compassionate side of the church.
Similar programs have also been used in Boston and Cincinnati.
   Of 15 million non-practicing Catholics in the country, 40
percent of them would like to mend fences and return to church
activity, according to a Gallup Poll, the article says.

<HEAD>Study Finds Celibacy Rule Widely Violated And Unexamined</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An extensive study of celibacy among Roman Catholic priests
finds that only half of them adhere to the discipline and that the
subject itself is largely unexamined and confined to ``a realm of
the secret.''
   Psychotherapist A. W. Richard Sipe, a resigned Roman Catholic
priest who made the 25-year study involving 1,000 priests and 500
of their intimates, said the church shuns exploring realities of
the celibacy requirement.
   To church officials, ``it can't be talked about in any way of
actually discussing it,'' he said. ``It can't be questioned or
logical arguments put forth about it.
   ``All that is considered acceptable is to reiterate the party
line.''
   Sipe, 57, a lecturer in the psychiatry department of the John
Hopkins University medical school in Baltimore and also in private
family-therapy practice there, added in an interview:
   ``An astounding thing, not one seminary in the country has a
course on celibacy. Not one even has a course on the history of
celibacy. So my church demands a state of celibacy without
educating about it or supporting it.''
   Sipe, whose findings are to be detailed in a book, ``A Secret
World: Sexuality and the Search for Celibacy,'' to be published
next month by Brunner@Mazel, said the church avoids the issues.
   ``It relegates that activity to the area of the secret, to a
secret world,'' he said. ``You cannot have Christian responsibility
and put an important part of it in a secret world.''
   Roman Catholicism's rule of priestly celibacy is not a doctrine
of faith but a clerical discipline. It was not required until the
12th century.
   Even afterward, some priests, bishops, cardinals and even an
occasional pope were married and ``concubinage flourished for
centuries among clergy vowed to celibacy,'' Sipe said.
   His findings came as surveys indicate a rising majority of U.S.
priests and laity favor ``optional celibacy,'' allowing marriage
for priests who chose it.
   On the basis of his large-scale data, Sipes estimates 50 percent
of priests uphold celibacy to a great extent, while the other 50
percent violate it. Twenty percent have regular relationships with
women, he said.
   ``Many of these relationships are remarkably durable and
personally compatible with the practice of ministry,'' he added.
``Some behaviors, of course are exploitative and pathologically
determined.''
   In a preliminary summary of his findings last Saturday to a
convention of the American Psychological Association in Boston,
Sipes said another 6 to 8 experiment with non-celibacy in a
``dating-like behavior.''
   Additionaly, 10 to 13 percent of priests are active homosexuals,
he said, while 6 percent involve themselves sexually with children
or minors, in most cases homosexually.
   One percent practice cross-dressing transvestism and 5 percent
involve themselves in ``problematic sexual activity'' such as
pornography and ``compulsive masturbation''
   Sipes said masturbation, which the church condemns, is a ``great
conundrum for the student of celibacy because it is a common
occurrence'' _ about 80 percent of priests do it occasionally.
   Of the half of priests upholding celibacy, Sipes said only 2
percent have firmly ``achieved celibacy'' in a mature sense, while
another 6 to 8 percent, despite missteps, have solidly established
the discipline.
   Additionally, he said 40 percent of priests are ``practicing
celibacy sufficiently well enough to be called celibate,'' although
``unresolved personal and spiritual issues'' sometimes bring
non-celibate behavior.
   Sipe, who left the priesthood in 1970 to marry, said his study
identified four essential elements that make for a mature
adjustment to celibacy, namely:
   ``Productive work, a well-defined prayer life, a deep sense of
community, and a dedication to service.''
   The study, conducted from 1960 through 1985, involved in-depth
interviews and reports from 1,500 people, a third of them priests
in psychotherapy, a third priests in other settings, and a third
lovers or others closely associated with priests.
   He said that despite the obscurity in which celibacy has been
shrouded and the lack of objective study of it, ``celibacy has been
a powerful factor in spiritual and cultural achievement in both the
West and East.''
   However, he said the present church approach is crippled by
inadequate training of priests in human sexuality generally and by
lack of education in celibacy itself.
   Considering the wraps kept on the subject, preventing genuine,
pro-and-con analysis of it, Sipes said:
   ``I say that bishops don't know any more about celibacy than
priests and that you would find among bishops the whole spectrum of
sexual adjustment and problems just as you do among priests.
   ``It is logical to assume that bishops suffer the same sexual
pressures as priests. And if priests get involved sexually, bishops
must also. There is no question about this. The further I go in
this study, the more surprises there are about what goes on.''

<TEXT>
   Tepito, the infamous smugglers' market, is
suffering an identity crisis.
   Mexico has thrown its doors open to imports, making Sonys and
Mars Bars legal. Yesterday's contraband is available at stores with
names like Super Gringo.
   What's a smuggler to do?
   Cut prices. Build a shopping center. Offer cheap parking.
   ``Tepitenos have always had a keen sense of timing, an eye for
opportunity,'' said Miguel Galan, president of the Confederation of
Tepito Merchant Associations.
   In the 1970s, when Mexico was flush with oil money, Tepito
became known as the place to buy contraband, known as fayuca.
   Tough import restrictions meant only smugglers could supply the
booming consumer demand for Japanese televisions and stereos, for
shampoo and sweets made in the U.S.A.
   Residents of Tepito, a scrappy inner-city slum, were glad to
oblige.
   It became a place where guts and a pickup could make a prince of
a pauper. Tepitenos streamed back and forth across the U.S. border
like ants, buying off police and customs officers.
   ``Fayuca flourished because it was good business for everybody:
customs, the police, the Tepitenos, the consumers,'' Galan said.
   Things began to change after Mexico joined the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1986. President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has further eased import restrictions since taking office
in 1988.
   Most of merchandise in Tepito, which specializes in electronics,
now is imported legally because ``people realized it was easier to
pay taxes than to make payoffs,'' Galan said in an interview.
   The prospect of legitimacy has spawned ambitious visions of
direct imports from Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. It
evokes dreams of conventional grandeur.
   Galan proudly unfurled an architect's rendering of a five-story,
172,000-square-foot commercial center that would replace the maze
of stalls, booths and shops run by thousands of people whose
families have done business here for generations.
   ``We need 4,000 parking spaces, minimum,'' Galan said.
   Is it possible that infamous Tepito, home to 14,000 merchants,
could become just another shopping mall?
   On the surface, the district seems to have changed little. It
hums with the raffish energy that made it legend.
   Housewives haggle with hustlers; carts jam the streets, laden
with products as diverse as fresh donuts and eggs of endangered
turtles. Pickpockets prey on the unwary in a bruising din of
radios, stereos, televisions, video players and Nintendos.
   Merchandise still changes hands on a cash-only,
don't-even-think-of-asking-for-a-receipt-or-warranty basis.
   Tomorrow's Tepito already seems to be evolving, however. Since
Mexico opened its borders, small-time smugglers have been largely
replaced by bulk importers, legitimate and otherwise.
   ``There used to be thousands of people bringing stuff across the
border,'' said Alejandra Escareno, a third-generation Tepitena.
``Now there are only a handful of big guys. They bring in stuff by
the trailer load, put it in their warehouses and sell it to small
vendors.''
   Escareno, 42, said small-timers can't offer competitive prices,
so she quit dealing in electronics when it became legal.
   ``How could we compete when we had 10 televisions and they had
100?'' she asked. Escareno went back to the family's old line: used
clothes, another time-honored business in Tepito.
   Tepito is a scavenger on the edges of Mexican history. For
decades, it was like a quirky mirror that reflected the silver
lining instead of the cloud.
   ``There has always been a special kind of person here who could
figure out how to keep ahead of the game,'' Tepito historian
Alfonso Hernandez y Hernandez said in a recent interview with the
newspaper La Jornada.
   Its open-air markets emerged after the desperate years of the
1910-1920 Revolution. Craftsmen displaced by war settled in Tepito
and survived by patching old clothes and shoes.
   World War II shortages rekindled the demand for refurbished
items, and then came the postwar years of growth.
   As people moved into Mexico City's new suburbs, Tepitenos
snapped up their discarded possessions.
   ``They cast off their old things in the rush to be `modern',''
Galan said, running a hand over the huge, claw-footed desk his
father had found. ``Tepito became known as the place to get
bargains on antiques.''
   Businessmen like Galan, who quit living in Tepito after he made
a fortune in pirated cassettes, sometimes are described as
insensitive to its special nature.
   Most Tepitenos are fiercely loyal to the neighborhood, which
already was a teeming slum when Spanish conquerors arrived in 1519.
   The spirit that bred its smugglers also has spawned writers,
painters and poets. Some fear legitimacy may be the one thing this
barrio of about 400,000 people cannot survive.
   Escareno considered Galan's vision of megashopping, parking lots
and computerized marketing, and said:
   ``Tepito is a special place. The community is very united. But
it just wouldn't be the same.''

<HEAD>New Policy of Disengagement Frustrates Soldiers and Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army plans to lower
the Israeli flag and remove a tent encampment near Gaza City as
part of a new policy intended to reduce friction with Palestinians.
   Soldiers have orders not to open fire and to avoid
confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Patrols rarely enter the
villages and crowded refugee camps.
   The disengagement reflects a radical shift in the army's
military doctrine, and its effectiveness is reducing bloodshed in
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began in
December 1987.
   No one has been killed since May in the Gaza Strip, where the
uprising began. In July, three Palestinians were killed in the West
Bank, the lowest monthly toll of the revolt, in which Israelis have
killed well over 700 Palestinians.
   ``This can't be called turning a blind eye . . . but whoever
thought of it was brilliant,'' a military commander said, on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the policy had been implemented gradually after the
massacre of seven Gaza workers by an Israeli gunman May 20 started
10 days of riots in which 18 Palestinians died.
   Israel is changing its tactics at a time of of increasing
conflict among Palestinians.
   Since June 1, twice as many Palestinians have been killed by
other Palestinians as by soldiers, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   Assad Saftawi, an elementary school principal and leading PLO
supporter in the Gaza Strip, described the new policy as a ploy by
Defense Minister Moshe Arens to improve Israel's image abroad.
   Some prominent Palestinians say the uprising is in trouble and
seek a new, longer-term strategy to revive morale.
   Hamdi Faraj, a journalist in Bethlehem, said PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat should acknowledge the revolt, or intefadah, has flagged and
is unlikely to bring Palestinian statehood in the new future.
   ``There is a gap between what the PLO says and what the people
see,'' he said. ``The state is not a stone's throw away like they
claim in slogans.''
   At the Dheishe refugee camp in the West Bank, several activists
blamed Palestine Liberation Organization policy for the revolt's
loss of impetus and accused Arafat of making concessions without
getting anything in return.
   Khaled, 25, who says he has been wounded three times and served
10 months in jail without trial, said Arens timed his change of
strategy well. ``The intefadeh has cooled down and Arens played his
cards at the right time because people are tired and not chasing
after the army,'' he said.
   Ibrahim, 33, said: ``The intefadeh has almost stopped, and the
people have to start realizing that they have to take the solution
in their own hands and do it themselves.'' He said younger men
should be brought into the PLO leadership.
   Neither gave his last name.
   For the army, the Arens policy signifies reversal of a
longstanding military doctrine of taking the offensive and
confronting each small demonstration to keep riots from developing.
   ``It was very strange for the soldiers, who have been drilled to
charge, to attack and to fire, to be told, `halt . . . restrain
yourselves','' the military commander said.
   Because of the relative quiet, he said, an army encampment set
up in the middle of the village of Beit Hanun would be dismantled
and the troops evacuated. Villagers were told soldiers would return
in force at the first signs of violence.
   Restraint also was evident elsewhere.
   From an army lookout post near the Jabalia refugee camp, black
smoke could be seen rising as Palestinian youths ignited a tire in
the streets.
   In the past, such an act would have brought swift action by an
army patrol, and possibly casualties.
   This time, Itzik, a 21-year-old first sergeant, looked at the
smoke and shrugged his shoulders.
   ``We'll probably let it burn itself out,'' he said. ``Besides,
it creates a lot of heavy black smoke and the (Palestinians) have
to breathe it. If it were four or five tires, then we'd probably go
in with a company'' of about 100 men, he said.
   Politicians have praised the army for restraint, but military
sources said some soldiers of lower rank felt it could be
interpreted as a sign of weakness.
   Young Palestinians say they will carry the fight to the army.
   ``Arens might pull back the soldiers, but in that case we will
start chasing the army,'' said Fuad, 17, who showed a reporter
wounds behind the ear and on his arm from rubber-coated steel
bullets.

<HEAD>Bonnie Bedelia Is Widow of Slain Policeman in HBO Thriller</HEAD>

   Bonnie Bedelia, following roles in two of
this summer's biggest box office hits, also stars in a
race-against-time TV thriller about evidence that might free a man
about to go to the electric chair.
   Bedelia plays the widow of a slain policeman in the Home Box
Office movie ``Somebody Has To Shoot the Picture,'' which debuts
Wednesday, Sept. 12.
   She also plays Bruce Willis' wife in ``Die Hard 2'' and Harrison
Ford's wife in ``Presumed Innocent.''
   ``If I'd been in `Ghost,' I'd be in the three biggest pictures
of the summer,'' she said.
   In the HBO movie, Arliss Howard, about to be executed for
killing Bedelia's husband seven years earlier, requests that a
burned-out photographer played by Roy Scheider photograph the
execution.
   Scheider reluctantly accepts the job. When the execution is
stayed for 48 hours, an alcoholic ex-cop who was at the murder
scene kills himself. Scheider finds an old photograph among his
effects that refutes crucial evidence at the trial and indicates a
cover-up might have taken place.
   ``Although Hannah has an affair with the photographer, this is
not a love story,'' Bedelia said of her character. ``This washed-up
photographer comes to town and she's bowled over. She's been a
widow for a long time, and sometimes it takes someone from the
outside.
   ``She's a working-class woman, and he's famous. She even goes to
the library to look up his work. They're not in love. It was just
an impulsive thing.''
   Their fling is the backdrop for a complicated story that even
Bedelia admits she had difficulty following. Director Frank Pierson
used the opportunity to also examine the issue of capital
punishment, which he said in an HBO press release that he opposes.
   Robert Carradine plays the murdered policeman's partner, and
Andre Braugher is a reporter. The screenplay was written by Doug
Magee, a photojournalist who published a book on death row
prisoners in 1980.
   Pierson co-wrote the screenplay for ``Presumed Innocent,'' but
Bedelia did not meet him until he directed ``Somebody Has To Shoot
the Picture.''
   She said she didn't find her character to be as complicated as
the story.
   ``She was a woman whose husband had been killed, and she had
stayed in the town,'' she said. ``I don't know why, but it wasn't
important to the story. ... I don't imagine she was very
well-educated. It wasn't a part that required a lot of delving. She
was a simple person.''
   Bedelia said her three recent roles, two wives and a widow, have
little in common.
   ``In `Die Hard 2,' she's an executive of a multinational
corporation. Her husband's a cop. She probably makes five times
what he does. She's left him. She's totally secure and confident.
In `Presumed Innocent,' she's a mathematician who's totally caught
up in her work at the university. She's insecure and has
deep-rooted problems stemming from her childhood. In the HBO movie,
she's a manicurist married to a cop who was killed in his rookie
year.
   ```Die Hard' was a lark. It's not something you have to give a
lot of thought to. It's not meant to be deep. It's bang-bang-bang.
In `Presumed Innocent,' she's an interesting person. She's very
bright, but not very confident. She's insecure, and her husband
gives her a lot of reason to be.''
   Bedelia grew up in New York, and made her acting debut at the
age of 7. She had been in six Broadway shows by the time she was 17.
   She appeared in more than a hundred shows during the heyday of
live television drama and also worked in several series filmed in
New York, such as ``Naked City,'' ``East Side, West Side'' and
``The Defenders.''
   Her career reached a low point in 1980 when she returned to work
after her second son entered kindergarten. But in 1983, she played
race driver Shirley Muldowney in ``Heart Like a Wheel,'' a turning
point for her.
   In November, she will co-star with Billy Crystal in ``City
Slickers,'' a comedy about a group of city dwellers who sign up for
a vacation cattle drive.

   Recent high-profile campaigns to locate
bone-marrow donors have overshadowed a worrisome plight: The
nation's two major bone-marrow registries are at odds.
   Wide-ranging campaigns to enlist potential donors have created a
backlog of blood samples for testing. And when the tests finally
are done, not all patients get access to the results, partly
because the two registries have acted in competition, not in
concert.
   Their failure to share information is more than a bureaucratic
tangle. It wastes time, and time is the one thing these dying
patients don't have.
   ``Patients are caught in the middle,'' acknowledges Liz Quam,
spokeswoman for the National Marrow Donor Program, which has been
criticized by its smaller rival, the American Association of Bone
Marrow Registries.
   ``The country and the patients are not going to be helped to the
fullest with these two groups fighting like dogs and cats,'' said
Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute.
   A marrow transplant is the last hope for thousands of patients
with leukemia, aplastic anemia and other diseases. But time is
precious in the search for a donor.
   ``You don't have an extra day or month,'' said Bonnie Lundquist
of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who searched for months for a transplant
for her husband, Peter. He died in February _ a week after
potential donors were found.
   The odds of finding a perfect match are, at best, 20,000-to-1,
so the bigger the pool of donors, the better the chance.
   The National Marrow Donor Program, a quasi-governmental agency,
is the nation's largest donor bank, with more than 150,000 names.
American has 35,320 potential donors, and also offers low-cost
access to foreign registries.
   About 10,000 Americans a year search for a marrow match. Public
awareness about transplants has burgeoned in the past eight months
_ largely because of people like leukemia patient Allison Atlas,
20, of Bethesda, Md.
   Her determined supporters, Friends of Allison, ran a highly
publicized search for a perfect marrow match that raised $3 million
and enrolled 50,000 potential donors. Atlas's quest was
unsuccessful; she got an imperfectly matched transplant from her
mother before time ran out.
   National, based in St. Paul, Minn., hopes to one day have the
nation's sole registry. It is supported in part by federal funds
and draws on 70 major blood banks for its donor base.
   American's registry, based in Mandeville, La., is a network of
community-based donor pools and gets no federal funds. Each local
pool began to help a particular patient, then expanded to aid other
patients before joining in a network.
   The rift between the two registries came to light in February in
a congressional staff paper co-written by health policy analyst
Hellen Gelband, who noted a lack of coordination from the patients'
perspective.
   ``People didn't always find out that there were different
registries they could go to,'' Gelband said in an interview.
   Have deaths occurred because patients weren't aware of all their
options?
   ``You'd have a hard time documenting it. But it could have
happened, certainly,'' she said.
   ``We get kids who've been searching with National eight to nine
months and found nothing, and don't have eight weeks left when we
get them,'' said Joanne Raymond, executive director of American.
   ``When I'm talking to the mother of a 6-year-old who died
yesterday because we had a donor but they didn't get to us in time,
I can't see the big picture any longer,'' she said.
   Critics say there are two basic obstacles: Patients don't know
where to turn, and the donor banks don't share their resources.
   National started sharing donor lists with American on April 16,
but its data is too incomplete for a successful search, Raymond
said. And American thus far has refused offers to merge with the
larger National.
   The reason, says the congressional paper: ``Major philosophical
differences having to do with transplant center access, costs,
search information and approval of transplant centers.''
   National requires patients to be admitted to costly hospital
transplant centers before they can search its donor registry. At
American, patients can search with permission from their doctors,
without entering a center.
   National says transplant centers ensure that donors get the best
possible care and don't waste their time giving marrow to a patient
who isn't eligible for transplant or properly prepared for surgery.
Quam said the centers also relieve unqualified patients of false
hope.
   American believes in trying, even when the odds seem impossible.
   And while National focuses on donor protection, with an eye
toward research, Raymond says she's more oriented toward patients.
   The congressional paper said the price of searching for a match
and harvesting bone marrow varies substantially by transplant
center even though the center itself ``is minimally involved in
those activities and is paying the registry for those services.''
   Gelband found that patients who never find a successful match
spend an average of $4,000, and sometimes up to $15,000. Patients
who go through transplants can spend $100,000 to $200,000,
depending on whether there are complications, said Quam.
   American and National are considering proposals that would help
them work together, though neither side will discuss them yet.
Congress also is looking at the rivalry. For now, the turmoil
continues in court battles and press releases.
   Until recently, the Life-Savers Foundation of America, based in
Covina, Calif., was National's recruitment and fund-raising nerve
center. Friends of Allison was a major tributary of Life-Savers.
   Then Life-Savers and National split. In a pending court case in
Minneapolis, Life-Savers says it now is a registry in itself. It
enlisted 100,000 donors for National in the past and wants to share
them; National wants sole rights to them.
   Dr. Rudolf Brutoco, founder and chairman of Life-Savers, said he
was disgusted by delays at National that wasted patients' precious
time. But it was Life-Savers' success that helped overload the
system, backing up lab tests and paperwork at the donor centers.
   When the Atlases began their search, National had gathered
57,000 donors in three years.
   The money the program had allocated for blood typing paid for
1,300 new donors a year; the Atlases brought in that many in two
days.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: two days.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Matching marrow is a three-step process. First, the blood is
tested to classify its first four antigens, or cell identifiers;
that costs $75 per donor. The second step is to identify the last
two antigens; that costs about $300. If all six match, a final test
mixes the patient's and donor's blood to see if one rejects the
other.
   Because of the cost, the second step _ called DR typing _
usually is not done until a match is achieved on the first four
antigens. Only about 30 percent of National's donors, for example,
have had DR typing.
   On June 1, Life-Savers' staff followed up on potential marrow
donors whose names had been submitted to National as far back as
March. In two days, the staff members claimed, they located 62
potential donors who had not yet been contacted by National for
follow-up tests.
   National responds that it sometimes has trouble locating donors
after a potential match is found. And the registry says some
patients with common blood types can be matched preliminarily to
scores of donors; National says it can't test each of those matches
immediately, due to the logistics and high cost.
   For its part, National said it wants to do away with
Life-Savers' publicity techniques, featuring poignant pleas for
donors by patients and their families. Instead, it will seek donors
to contribute marrow and money through corporations and service
organizations.
   Quam said Life-Savers, in essence, told families how much money
had to be raised. ``We don't want these determined moms and dads to
feel so much pressure they have to second mortgage their homes,
plead with relatives or cash in IRAs,'' she said.
   Leaders of each registry include people who got involved because
of the illness of a family member or friend, and those emotional
ties color the debate over what approach to use.
   Those same emotions are at work among those who want to
reorganize a system that is not working.
   ``I'm concerned because it isn't a cohesive system, because it's
too much of a burden'' on families, said Mrs. Lundquist, the widow
whose husband's match came too late. ``I'm concerned that lives are
being lost because of an inadequate system.''

   The search for a bone-marrow transplant for
Peter Lundquist dragged on for months. It was more time than he had.
   Lundquist, 37, a Miami television news anchor and father of
three, died of lymphoma in February, a week after potential donors
were found.
   His wife, Bonnie, says administrative delays in a bogged-down
system robbed her husband of precious time.
   Lundquist wanted others to have the chance that eluded him.
Before he died, he extracted some ``pretty stringent'' promises
from his wife: to help other patients and better the system.
   ``Peter was a really giving person, who cared about other
people,'' Mrs. Lundquist said in a telephone interview. ``He left
those good qualities: I tried to step in where he had to leave
off.''
   Mrs. Lundquist promotes marrow donation, because ``patients have
no other options: It's the only system we have right now.''
   But she wants lawmakers and the public to know that:
   _The bureaucracy needs to be speeded up. Lundquist was orking
through a transplant center; in August, his doctor asked the center
to authorize a search with the nation's biggest donor bank. The
search wasn't begun until November. Later, there were delays in
processing potential matches.
   ``You don't have an extra day or month with cancer or leukemia
patients,'' said Mrs. Lundquist.
   _The medical establishment doesn't tell patients about all their
options. A month after starting a search at the National Marrow
Donor Program, she heard from another patient's family about the
American Association of Bone Marrow Registries. She immediately
started a search in the second registry.
   _Patients' families need to keep constant tabs on the progress
of their donor search. Mrs. Lundquist said she called the
transplant center weekly for updates; the National Marrow Donor
Center doesn't take calls from patients.
   _Families, already under stress because of a loved one's
life-threatening illness, often must resort to public appeals for a
donor. They might not have to if more potential donors could be
found.
   ``I'm concerned because it isn't a cohesive system, because it's
too much of a burden'' on patients' families, she said. ``I'm
concerned that lives are being lost because of an inadequate
system.''
   Eventually, she said, ``each and every one of us will be faced
with a cancer or leukemia situation _ a brother, sister, friend,
father, co-worker, somebody you know will be affected.''
   Mrs. Lundquist, a former broadcast journalist, now lives in
suburban Fort Lauderdale and works as an aide to a state lawmaker.
She hopes to start a foundation to help people who need transplants.
   In the meantime, she gives advice and emotional support to
patients and their families.
   ``Remembering my situation doesn't paralyze me: it makes me
empathize and sympathize with them,'' she said. ``But it's hard,
because I realize the frustrations they feel. I wish I could wave a
magic wand and make it go away and have all the answers for them.
   ``For me to become bitter now would not help other people. I've
become a lot more positive and motivated to make some good out of
it _ not to become bitter and vengeful,'' she said.
   ``Each day is a precious day.''

   A government witness in the conflict of
interest case against Neil Bush says the president's son lost his
ethical moorings _ but did not try to deceive anyone _ while a
director of a Denver savings and loan.
   In testimony released Tuesday by the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision, University of Colorado professor Edward J. Conry wrote
that the 35-year-old Bush did not lie, try to conceal or mislead.
   Still, Neil Bush's conduct was unethical because he ``placed
himself in situations where his self-interest or loyalty to others
was in competition with the interests of depositors, shareholders,
insurers and taxpayers,'' wrote Conry, a professor of business law
and ethics.
   ``He became ethically myopic, unaware that his perspective or
conduct were biased,'' he said.
   Neil Bush was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association of Denver, which collapsed in December 1988 at a cost
to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   Conry was one of several expert witnesses on both sides whose
testimony was released by OTS and Bush's attorney, James Nesland.
The testimony was submitted to Administrative Law Judge Daniel J.
Davidson as part of the proceeding in the Bush case.
   Bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on Sept. 25
in Denver before Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to
OTS Director Timothy Ryan.
   In documents submitted by Bush, two experts disputed the
regulators' contention that Bush failed to adequately disclose to
Silverado his business relationships with Kenneth M. Good and Bill
L. Walters, two big borrowers from the thrift institution. Bush has
denied any wrongdoing.
   ``I have never observed charges of unsafe or unsound practices
as insubstantial as the charges filed against Bush,'' wrote Charles
M. Pickett, a former attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. ``In my opinion, Bush's actions underlying the charges
against him are not unsafe or unsound practices.''
   The OTS also submitted statements by several former Silverado
directors that they were not informed of Bush's precise
relationships with Good and Walters.
   In another document made public Tuesday, the OTS asked Davidson
to authorize subpoenas for former Silverado chairman Michael Wise
and Russell M. Murray, a former loan officer of the thrift.
   The thrift office noted that Wise has announced his intention to
refuse to testify by asserting his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination. However, the office said it believes Wise's
assertion of that right is invalid.
   In addition to the thrift agency's case, the FDIC is considering
filing a negligence lawsuit against Bush and other Silverado
directors.
   Pickett and Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a professor at Yale Law
School, supported Bush's contention that it was not a breach of his
duty to vote as a director on Silverado loans to Good and Walters,
since he didn't have a financial interest in the developers'
projects.
   Good and Walters invested millions of dollars in Bush's oil
partnership, JNB Exploration Co., which drilled a number of dry
holes in Wyoming over two years and never became profitable.
   Bush has asserted that before he joined the Silverado board, he
disclosed his relationships with Good and Walters to Wise, other
Silverado managers, the board of directors and the thrift's
attorneys.
   Good and Walters, two of Silverado's biggest borrowers, got a
combined total of $117 million in loans that they never repaid.

<HEAD>United, Northwest, American Delay Proposed Fuel-Related Fare
Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Several airlines are delaying for about a week a scheduled 5.3
percent fare increase that the carriers proposed to defray the
rising costs of jet fuel.
   At the same time, major airlines moved to match fare cuts that
Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines proposed earlier this
week for flights after Labor Day.
   The 5.3 percent fare hikes were to have gone into effect today,
but United Airlines and Northwest Airlines said Tuesday they were
delaying the hike until Aug. 22 while American Airlines postponed
it until Aug. 23.
   They said they were taking the action for competitive reasons
and that the delay meant they would absorb higher fuel costs for
the time being.
   The fare hikes were announced in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait that drove oil prices higher.
   American, for instance, said that each penny-a-gallon rise in
fuel prices costs the airline $25 million a year on an annual
basis. United estimated its costs go up $22.5 million a year under
similar conditions.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said his airlines' jet fuel
costs climbed 8 cents a gallon to 74 cents in 48 hours following
the invasion.
   In another development Tuesday, United, Northwest and American
offered lower fares in response to the post-Labor Day fare cuts
announced Monday by Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
   United said it would match the TWA and Eastern fare cuts,
American said it would match the TWA fares and Northwest announced
a reduction plan that it said ``parallels price reductions'' at TWA.
   Eastern had said it will introduce discount one-way fares
ranging from $69 to $139 and cover all of its 62 U.S. destinations
from Sept. 5 through Dec. 16. The tickets must be bought by Aug. 29.
   TWA said it will cut non-refundable domestic fares in most
markets at least 20 percent under similar conditions.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said
Tuesday he'll talk with airline executives this week to see what
the Department of Transportation can do to help them cope with high
fuel prices.
   He said he won't know what form the help might take until he
meets with the executives, ``but I think we can do a lot.''
   Skinner spoke with reporters after a tour of The Boeing Co.'s
commercial jetliner factory in Renton, Wash.

   Stock prices moved broadly higher today amid
signs that the Mideast crisis may be easing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 9.66 to
2,757.43 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining
ones by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 823
up, 388 down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 52.12 million
shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market was reacting favorably to the visit by
Jordan's King Hussein to the United States. Hussein was carrying a
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to President Bush.
   Speculation that the Mideast situation might be easing prompted
a stock rally in Japan. The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
the Nikkei, closed 5.4 percent higher. Stock prices also were
higher in London trading.
   Optimism about the Mideast prompted a turnaround in stock prices
Tuesday from lows earlier in the session.

   Ambase was the most active issue on the NYSE, losing 5 to 2{.
The financial holding company announced Tuesday it would sell its
insurance unit, reducing its assets by less than half, and use the
proceeds to pay down debt.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares rose
0.80 to 186.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Mixed As Inflation Fears Ease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned mixed
after a higher opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting an easing of the inflation fears that recently have
helped support the crop markets.
   The markets opened higher across the board in an extension of
Tuesday's rally, in which soybeans climbed as much as 9 cents a
bushel.
   But soybeans and corn turned mixed in reaction to a drop in oil
and gold futures prices in New York.
   Some analysts interpreted the early declines in the New York
markets as a sign that inflation fears are easing amid speculation
the Persian Gulf conflict may be resolved peacefully.
   Crude oil and gold rose dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait,
touching off worries that a reduction in crude-oil shipments from
the Middle East would push the U.S. economy into a recession.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.81\ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to } cent higher with September at $2.46 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with September at
$1.16\ a bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 5 cents higher with
August at $6.10 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .35 cent lower with August at
78.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent higher
with August at 89.95 cents a pound; live hogs .15 cent to .20 cent
higher with August at 56.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent to 1.27 cents higher with August at 52.10 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures retreated on Tuesday; pork futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Western Union Rescinds Lockout, Signs Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. signed a
tentative two-year contract today with the union representing 2,500
union employees, four days after it locked out 2,000 workers, union
officials said.
   The accord, which guarantees the same level of health benefits
and a 3.5 percent annual wage hike to the workers, must be ratified
by union members, said Steven Rosenthal, spokesman for the
Communications Workers of America.
   Workers who were locked out were asked to return to work,
Rosenthal said.
   Union lawyers filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board Monday over the company's lockout.
   Union employees authorized a walkout two weeks ago, but set no
date for a strike. On Monday, both sides expressed a desire to
continue the contract negotiations that began July 23, two weeks
before a two-year contract was due to expire.
   Talks continued after the agreement expired Aug. 6, but ran
aground on the desire to pare down medical benefits and to contract
work to outside firms. Western Union served notice Saturday that it
would replace most of its union employees unless labor officials
reconsidered a company offer to extend the expired contract by 90
days.

   Stock prices were mixed today amid signs that
the Mideast crisis may be easing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 1.48
points at 2,746.29 as of noon on Wall Street. Earlier, the Dow was
up by as much as 21 points.
   But in the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered
declining ones by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 807 up, 510 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 71.53 million
shares at midday.
   Analysts said the market was reacting favorably to the visit by
Jordan's King Hussein to the United States. Hussein was carrying a
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to President Bush.
   The market received an additional boost today by a drop in oil
prices and higher government bond prices.
   Speculation that the Mideast situation might be easing prompted
a stock rally in Japan. The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
the Nikkei, closed 5.4 percent higher. Stock prices also were
higher in London.
   Optimism about the Mideast prompted a turnaround in stock prices
Tuesday from lows earlier in the session.

rose &rsqb; to 47&lsqb;, Boeing gained &rsqb; to 52&rsqb;, IBM rose &rsqb; to 104} and

   AmBase was the most active issue on the NYSE, losing 4} to 2}.
The financial holding company, which announced Tuesday it would
sell its insurance unit, said it was unlikely that it would pay a
special dividend that had been promised to shareholders.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares rose

   The U.S. dollar fell sharply in Europe today,
hitting a post-war low against the German mark.
   Gold prices tumbled in hectic trading.
   Dealers said the lack of significant developments in the Persian
Gulf brought the dollar down as the market focused on the
fundamental weaknesses in the U.S. economy.
   Mike Lovell, a dealer with Bank of America in London, said the
dollar was hurt by growing belief that the Federal Reserve may be
poised to ease interest rates, a move that would diminish the value
of dollar-denominated securities.
   The dollar was also hurt by indications the Middle East crisis
might be winding down. Jordan's King Hussein traveled to Washington
for talks with President Bush, reportedly carrying a letter from
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 147.15 Japanese yen, from 149.90
yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London, it remained unchanged at
147.15 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9045 from $1.8930 late
Tuesday. At midday in New York it cost $1.9028 to buy one pound.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.5605 West German marks, down from 1.5685; 1.3005
Swiss francs, down from 1.3055; 5.2365 French francs, down from
5.2695; 1.7579 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7675; 1,145.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,152.50, and 1.1435 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1452.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5605 German
marks, 147.47 Japanese yen, 1.3000 Swiss francs, 1,156.25 Italian
lire and 1.1434 Canadian dollars.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $401.25 a troy ounce,
from $410.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $398.75
down from $412.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $9.50 to close at a bid $401.50.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.12 a

   Share prices finished slightly higher during a
choppy session at the London Stock Exchange Wednesday, aided by
news that Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) sold its 25
percent stake in Enterprise Oil PLC.
   The early-morning deal was confirmed by brokerages Warburg
Securities Ltd. and Cazenove and Co., which said they bought ICI's
block of 113.3 million Enterprise shares for 600 pence per share,
or about $11.40, for a total 679.6 million pounds ($1.29 billion).
   Investors then snapped up the stock as it was sold on the open
market.
   Outside the Enterprise news, which had been widely rumored in
the market, there was little overall activity, dealers said.
   Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wall Street shot up
as much as 20 points at the start of New York trading, London
investors paid scant attention. By the close of the European day,
the Dow Jones industrials were up 3.22 points at 2,750.99.
   The broad-based Financial Times-SE 100-share index closed up 5.3
points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,239.3, off the day's high of 2,244.6,
and well above the low of 2,231.2.
   Volume was 563.6 million shares, up from 330.9 million issues
which changed hands Tuesday.
   At its latest calculation, the narrower Financial Times 30-share
index was up 5.6 points at 1,748.2. The Financial Times 500 index
was up 1.71 points at 1,207.63.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a session that
was relatively quiet except for a late surge in the soybean market.
   Soybeans sold off early in the afternoon amid reports that
Brazil's government would make available the equivalent of $4.2
billion in farm loans for the planting season beginning in
September.
   Uncertainty about the level of government assistance Brazilian
farmers would receive had been a supportive factor in the soybean
market.
   Soybeans rebounded strongly near the close, though, on buying
that analysts attributed to technical factors.
   Wheat futures were strong all day, partly reflecting farmers'
reluctance to sell wheat at current prices.
   ``Prices are so darn low, they're just sitting on the stuff,''
said Katharina Zimmer, a grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Captial
Markets Inc. in New York.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4{ cents to 5\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.84{ a bushel;
corn was { cent lower to 1} cents higher with September at $2.47\ a
bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 3 cents higher with September at

<HEAD>After Splashy Debut, Steve Jobs' New Company Has Hardly Made a
Dent</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto, Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some experts are starting to wonder
whether there is much of a ``next'' for Steve Jobs' new computer.
   Launched with splashy publicity in October 1988, the Next
machine was supposed to revolutionize personal computers, like the
Apple that Jobs and former partner Steve Wozniak hatched in a
garage in 1976, and the Macintosh that Jobs gave the world in 1984.
   One of the industry's most innovative creators, Jobs called the
Next the ``best computer in the world.''
   Nearly two years later, Next Computer Inc. has hardly made a
dent. Only a few thousand of the sleek black boxes have been sold,
and the Next has failed to generate great interest among corporate
computer users, analysts say.
   ``The fundamental problem with Next is they were just born at
the wrong time,'' said Esther Dyson, who publishes the computer
industry newsletter Release 1.0.
   ``It's one more desktop computer,'' she said. ``The next new
revolutionary advance is not going to happen on the desktop,'' but
on the new hand-held computers that recognize handwriting, she
predicts.
   Others say the Next machine may be too advanced for its own
good. For example, it stores data on a state-of-the-art optical
disk, which offers vastly more capacity than conventional magnetic
``floppy'' disks. But optical disks are much slower at retrieving
data. Jobs has since offered a faster magnetic hard disk as an
option, but still no floppy disk drive.
   ``Although the machine is exciting intellectually and important
from a computer architecture point of view, most customers have
work to do. They don't get off on computer technology,'' said
Richard Shaffer, the editor of Technologic Computer Letter, another
trade letter.
   An additional problem for Next is the machine's unique operating
system, the base layer of software that controls internal computer
functions. It makes the Next incompatible with other computers at a
time when the industry is moving toward interchangeable systems.
   Software must be specially tailored for the Next _ it can't use
popular off-the-shelf software such as Lotus 1-2-3.
   That creates one of its most serious dilemmas: Because
relatively little software exists to run on the Next, it has a hard
time attracting customers. Because there are few customers,
software developers are reluctant to write programs for it.
   ``At the moment there still is no major application for which
the Next machine is the best solution, or even more important, the
only solution,'' Shaffer said.
   Next's critics also say the machine is too expensive _ $9,995 to
the general public and $6,495 to universities. It didn't help that
the operating system was delayed until almost a year after the
computer was unveiled, they add.
   Jobs, who founded Next in 1985 after leaving Apple Computer Inc.
in a management dispute, said in January his detractors would be
impressed by the fledgling company's performance in six months.
   Since then, Next announced what apparently is its largest
contract, the sale of about 300 machines to William Morris Agency
Inc., the Beverly Hills, Calif., talent firm. The company said it
chose Next because of its ability to store videos of entertainers
as well as text-based information.
   But the industry is still waiting for delivery on Jobs' promise.
   ``I would say there's a certain degree of disappointment,'' said
Beverly Bird, a spokeswoman for Businessland, a computer store
chain that signed an exclusive deal with Next in March 1989 to
retail its machines domestically.
   At the time, Businessland predicted sales would hit $100 million
in the first year.
   But sales have fallen short. International Data Corp., a
high-tech research firm, estimates that fewer than 7,000 Nexts were
sold as of June.
   Next is privately owned and therefore is not obligated to
disclose sales or finances. Jobs declined to be interviewed for
this article.
   Bird said the $100 million estimate was based on availability of
Next's operating system and applications software. Potential
customers are still awaiting groundbreaking software that will
entice them to buy the machine, she said.
   ``We know those products are coming,'' she said.
   She said Businessland has placed Next machines with a number of
potential customers who are evaluating them or are working on
software for internal applications that would run on Next computers.
   Despite the slow start, no one is predicting Next's demise. The
company is heavily capitalized. One of its principal owners, the
Japanese high-tech company Canon Inc., paid $100 million for a
one-sixth share last year.
   The Canon purchase valued Next at $600 million, which Shaffer
called ``a mouth-opening, jaw-dropping valuation for a company so
young.''
   Next's other principal owner, aside from Jobs, is billionare
computer magnate H. Ross Perot, while International Business
Machines Corp. has paid Next to license its user interface _ its
easy-to-use on-screen graphics that control the machine _ for an
option on IBM computers.
   Next aides say they're working on the shortcomings. A faster
processing chip is promised later this year, along with a color
monitor. More software is on the way, including a spreadsheet
product from Lotus Development Corp., said Todd Rulon-Miller,
Next's vice president of sales.
   ``We're trying to develop and deliver some compelling or
breakthrough applications this year,'' he said in an interview at
Next headquarters in this Silicon Valley community. ``We're
starting to begin to see the efforts of a thousand software
developers who went through training at a Next developer camp last
year.''
   While Next has critics, it also has received praise from many
computer aficionados. They say it is extremely easy to use vs.
rival machines, has razor-sharp graphics and is a computer
programmer's dream thanks to a built-in feature that allows easy
assembly of new programs.
   The Next also has a built-in sound device that allows users to
add spoken comments to computer documents through a microphone. The
comments, in digital sound, can be played back the next time the
document file is opened.
   Jobs has said he believes the merger of text, voice and video _
so-called multimedia _ will represent the ``third wave'' of desktop
computing; the first two were spreadsheets and desktop publishing.
He also has predicted the Next will establish the third major
computing standard after those of IBM and Apple.
   Experts emphasize that other entirely new computers, such as the
Macintosh, lacked adequate software at first. When the Macintosh
found its original niche _ desktop publishing _ a flood of software
followed.
   It took about two years for the Macintosh to catch on. In the
interim, critics also questioned whether the Mac was a mistake.
   ``It takes a long, long time to bring a new machine to the
market,'' said Shaffer, the trade letter publisher. ``Even if it
were the next Macintosh we're still early in the course. I wouldn't
write it off yet.''

   From the outside, Next Computer's
nondescript white factory building could be mistaken for an
insurance company claims office.
   Inside, it looks more like a showroom for Italian furniture.
Next Chairman Steve Jobs' fascination with detail and design is
evident everywhere, from the slick black-and-white decor to the two
varieties of gourmet coffee in the employee lunchroom.
   A glass wall behind the reception area reveals the building's
true purpose: Through it, the company's highly automated assembly
line can be glimpsed below.
   The assembly floor is surprisingly small _ about the size of a
couple of football fields. On a recent visit, it also was
surprisingly quiet. The assembly line was not running, and little
activity was evident among the handful of workers _ hardly a good
sign for Jobs' startup company.
   The idle assembly line and operating-room cleanliness gave the
plant, situated in a well-manicured office park, the air of a
science fair project.
   But Randy Heffner, Next's vice president of manufacturing, said
it is unusual for a startup computer company to have its own plant
in the first place. Most would farm out production until sales
increased to a level to justify the expenditure on machinery.
   By building its own plant, Heffner said, Next can control the
quality of its products, reduce inventory, cut retooling costs and
be more responsive to customer needs.
   He said the plant currently is operating at one-third capacity,
but he would not say what that figure is. Jobs has said the plant
can support sales of $1 billion a year.
   Of the 50 employees at the factory, only nine are needed to run
the custom-designed, robotic assembly line, which Next says is one
of the most advanced in the world. The rest work in packaging,
shipping and other areas.
   Because the company has its own assembly line, it can put
together its own prototype computer circuit boards to make sure
there will be no unforeseen problems in production that may not be
evident in the design phase, said Heffner, who worked at computer
giant Hewlett-Packard Co. before joining Next.
   In addition, it can produce a prototype board for Next's
engineers in a few days, instead of the few weeks if production
were contracted out, he said.
   About 20 revisions were made in the circuit board used in the
Next machine, he said.

<TEXT>
   A reorganization plan for the lettering-machine
maker Kroy Inc. and a European subsidiary has been confirmed by a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
   Under the plan approved by Judge Robert Mooreman, more than $1.9
billion in liabilities will be eliminated and Minneapolis-based Red
Oak Investment Corp. will provide operating funds.
   Confirmation of the plan ``provides sufficient working capital
to enable Kroy to continue to expand its operation and products,
and it preserves the jobs of our nearly 300 employees,'' said Kroy
President Howard Klemmer.
   Kroy and Kroy Europe Ltd. were sold in 1986 to a management
group and an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in a leveraged
buyout.
   Kroy was unable to repay the $60 million debt incurred in the
buyout and the company filed for reorganization May 15 under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Assets of $50 million
and liabilities of $53 million were listed on the bankruptcy
petition.
   During the confirmation hearing, it was announced that the
company had reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor
and Valley National Bank of Arizona, trustee of the ESOP, in a
$35.5 million lawsuit. The Labor Department had sued Kroy for
hurting the ESOP with the buyout.
   As part of the settlement, the Labor Department has agreed to
dismiss Kroy from the lawsuit.
   The company said the reorganization plan was supported by
virtually all of Kroy's significant creditors.
   The company, which has 120 employees at its Scottsdale, Ariz.,
headquarters, has manufacturing facilities in Osceola and St.
Croix, Wisc., and 400 dealers and distributors worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Nevada casinos raked in a record $4.91
billion in fiscal 1990, helped by increased tourist traffic and
major new resorts in Las Vegas.
   The taxable gross revenue was up 10.6 percent over the previous
fiscal year. State Gaming Control Board spokesman Harlan Elges said
the total revenues, before operating expenses and taxes, are double
what the clubs amassed only nine years earlier.
   The Las Vegas area accounted for $3.57 billion of the total, for
a 12.2 percent year-to-year increase. Elges said the southern
Nevada figures showed strong gains partly because of the opening of
the Mirage and Excalibur hotel-casinos, which together have added
about 6,000 more hotel rooms in Las Vegas.
   Reno-area clubs accounted for $784.2 million in fiscal 1990, up
6.7 percent.

<HEAD>In Europe and U.S., French Show Flair For Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evoking images of boardroom Napoleons, French
executives have struck out beyond their borders to wage the most
aggressive corporate takeover campaign in Europe.
   The conquests extend far beyond the continent. Goodrich tires,
Mack trucks and Maalox antacid are among the American products
French companies are commandeering in a trans-Atlantic offensive
even Napoleon would envy.
   Some experts say France, after decades of passive and insular
business practices, is simply catching up, girding itself for a
single European market by doing now what corporations from other
economic powers have done for years.
   But there is no disagreement that the French have undertaken the
process with skill, enthusiasm, vast reserves of cash, and the
strong encouragement of their government.
   That encouragement has prompted some complaints, arising from
the fact that many of the acquisitive French companies are
state-owned.
   European Deal Review, published by the U.S. consultancy group
Translink, said there were 40 French state acquisitions of European
targets in 1989, valued at $3.34 billion.
   ``France is in effect nationalizing Europe,'' said Mark Dixon,
the review's editor.
   Many governments consider such takeovers unfair because of the
protection given to the French companies by their own government.
   European Community officials recently ordered Renault and other
French companies to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars of
state aid which was ruled to give them an unfair advantage over
companies from other EC members.
   Britain, the most popular target for French companies last year,
said it may adopt special measures to prevent state-backed
takeovers.
   The Sunday Times of London, in a recent full-page article titled
``France Inc. Storms the Barricades,'' said many experts ``see the
hidden hand of the French government behind the sudden aggression
of French deal-makers, who, for the first time, have overtaken the
British as Europe's most acquisitive businessmen.''
   In July alone, French companies announced a series of ambitious,
far-flung acquisitions, including financier Bernard Tapie's
headline-making purchase of an 80 percent interest in Adidas, the
West German-based sporting goods giant.
   In other transactions last month:
   _ Accor became the world's largest operator of hotel rooms, with
160,000 worldwide, by purchasing Motel 6 of the United States.
Accor's owners described their firm as ``the McDonalds of the hotel
world'' after adding 554 budget motels to a network that already
included 850 hotels and 3,000 restaurants in 60 countries.
   _ Lafarge Coppee became Europe's largest cement producer by
acquiring VEB Karsdorf, a major East German company.
   _ State-owned Usinor Sacilor announced plans to acquire Edgcomb
Corp., a major U.S. steel trading company. Usinor Sacilor became
the world's second-biggest steel producer in 1989 through an
aggressive foreign expansion.
   ``Usinor reflects the imperialistic style that appears to be in
vogue in France,'' said Peter Dupont, a steel industry analyst with
UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd. in London.
   ``The neo-Napoleonic trend is slightly anachronistic in terms of
today's conventional wisdom,'' he said, ``but it's in line with the
tendency of French governments to allow industrial policy to be
influenced by ideas of national prestige.''
   Olivier Collette, a Frenchman who directs the marketing
information section at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, said most French
companies are viewed favorably in the United States as productive
industrial investors rather than speculators.
   ``I've not detected any reaction similar to those concerning the
Japanese,'' he said, noting the French firms were rarely seeking
real estate investments.
   ``France was probably the last starter in this race,'' Collette
said. ``Three years ago, of the hundred largest French groups, you
had a very significant portion with very limited operations in the
United States, or none. Now, most of them have a significant
foothold in the U.S. market.''
   He said French investment in the United States is now roughly
equal to U.S. investment in France.
   Earlier this month, U.S. regulators approved the $1.8 billion
merger of Norton Co., a Massachusetts-based abrasives company, with
Saint Gobain of Paris, one of the world's leading glass
manufacturers.
   When Saint Gobain proposed the merger in March, to help Norton
avert a hostile takeover by a British firm, it won praise from the
U.S. management.
   ``With Saint Gobain as a partner, we will continue to be who we
are,'' said Norton's chairman, John Nelson.
   Another aggressive investor in the U.S. market has been
state-owned chemical company Rhone-Poulenc. It acquired a majority
interest this year in the Pennsylvania-based Rorer Group,
best-known as the maker of Maalox antacid, thereby forming one of
the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies.
   Earlier, the Michelin tire company acquired Uniroyal-Goodrich
and Pechiney, a major packaging manufacturer, bought American
National Can. Renault is in the process of buying Mack Trucks.
   On the other hand, the French can show a different side when
foreign acquirers come calling. For example, Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti tried to buy France's Pathe-Cinema film company
this year, but the government blocked the transaction on grounds it
was not in France's national interest.
   ``It's not as easy for foreign companies to make acquisitions in
France,'' said Ian Fisher of the MMG Patricof, a British buyout
firm. ``The French are much more protective of their
shareholdings.''
   Why the sudden surge of French acquisitions? Experts say it
results partly from French corporate fear of vulnerability in 1992,
when Western Europe is to be melded into a single market.
   ``French industries are realizing that if they are going to
compete in the new Europe, they're going to have to get out there
and do it,'' said Eammon Bates, head of the Brussels office of
Bernard Krief Consultants.
   In the past, he said, French companies got along satisfactorily
by serving their large domestic market, often with generous
government support.
   ``Now they may find their own markets at home are threatened (by
the single market). French industry has to defend its own
interests,'' Bates said.
   The best defense, France decided, was to take the offensive.
Companies fortified by France's prosperous economy set out on
concerted acquisition campaigns to gain large chunks of business
elsewhere.
   ``France, at the highest levels, has looked at the strategic
aspects of 1992 from a fairly partisan angle _ `If we exploit this
to the full, we can ensure further French preeminence in the EC,'
'' Bates said.

   Stock prices rose today in light trading,
boosted by moderating oil prices amid signs that the Mideast crisis
may be easing.
   Analysts said the market was reacting favorably to the visit by
Jordan's King Hussein to the United States. Hussein was carrying a
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to President Bush.
   Stocks received an additional boost as oil prices declined.
Government bond prices rose, also helping the stock market.
   ``It's been playing tag all day with bond prices and oil
prices,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior market specialist at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.
   He said the market's initial price spurt, in which the Dow Jones
industrial average rose as much as 21 points in the first half
hour, was based on expectations that some breakthrough was imminent
in the Mideast. When that did not materialize, prices moved lower.
   Speculation that the Mideast situation might be easing prompted
a stock rally in Japan. The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
the Nikkei, closed 5.4 percent higher, while stock prices also
gained in London.

<HEAD>Workers Return to Posts at Western Union Following Contract
Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AMY TEIBEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two thousand Western Union Corp. employees
got their jobs back Wednesday as the company signed a tentative
labor contract that rescinded a four-day lockout of union workers,
company and union officials said.
   The two-year settlement, reached at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday,
guarantees the same level of health benefits and a 3.5 percent
annual wage increase to the employees, who are represented by the
Communications Workers of America.
   About half the workers covered by the contract are recording
operators. The others include technicians, clerical workers and a
smaller number scattered in other departments.
   The contract also applies to 500 CWA employees not affected by
the Saturday morning lockout.
   Settlement of the labor dispute will free the company to
concentrate on its proposed recapitalization plan, which is
essential to Western Union's future, said Robert J. Amman, Western
Union president.
   The company's old contract with union workers expired Aug. 6.
Workers had authorized a strike two weeks ago, but the union never
threatened to strike, even after the lockout was declared, said Dan
J. Beckstead, the union's chief negotiator.
   ``(The company) probably started moving when they realized the
union and the membership was not going to crack under their
pressure of a lockout,'' Beckstead said.
   Employees who were locked out will be reinstated with full back
pay, Rosenthal said. Temporary replacements who had been staffing
the company's principal facilities since Saturday were withdrawn
Wednesday as union employees returned to work, Western Union
spokesman Warren Bechtel said.
   Beckstead said an unfair labor practice charge filed on Monday
with the National Labor Relations Board would be dropped. The
complaint alleged that the company violated federal labor law by
selectively locking out the 2,000 workers.
   The contract must be ratified by union members, said CWA
spokesman Steven Rosenthal. He said ballots will be mailed by next
week, with the tally expected to be completed by early September.
   The contract maintains pensions at current levels and retains a
profit-sharing program that was created in 1985 to compensate
workers for wage and benefits concessions, Rosenthal said.
   Union negotiators made some concessions on the company's ability
to contract work to outside firms and on the use of part-time
employees, Bechtel said.
   Much of the debate at the three-week-long talks centered on the
company's attempts to curtail medical benefits. Bechtel said the
company dropped its efforts to reduce medical benefits as part of
the ``normal bargaining process.''
   The agreement came hours before Western Union's adjourned annual
meeting was scheduled to reconvene. The meeting, to continue at 2
p.m. Thursday, will focus on the debt-ridden company's proposed
recapitalization plan.
   Under the plan, Western Union wants shareholders to approve the
reclassification of preferred shares into common shares.
   A two-thirds vote of the preferred shareholders is needed to
approve the plan, Bechtel said.
   The proposal also asks bondholders to allow the company to swap
$530 million in high-yield notes for new notes paying lower
interest rates and common shares.
   Noteholders originally had until midnight Wednesday to turn in
their bonds, but that deadline will be extended, Bechtel said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC sold its 25
percent stake in Britain's Enterprise Oil PLC on the open market
Wednesday, brokers said.
   Brokers Warburg Securities Ltd. and Cazenove and Co. said they
bought a block of 113.3 million Enterprise shares from ICI for
679.6 million pounds ($1.29 billion), or 600 pence a share. The
shares were then sold into the open market on the London Stock
Exchange.
   A total of 232 million Enterprise shares changed hands on the
London Stock Exchange Wednesday for prices of about 607 pence per
share ($11.53) traders said.
   Enterprise stock closed at 628 pence per share ($11.93)
Wednesday, while ICI shares finished at 950 pence ($18.05).
   Enterprise Oil is one of Britain's largest independent oil
exploration and production companies. Another 25 percent of its
shares are owned by France's Societe Nationale Elf-Aquitaine.
   Elf has focused on the North Sea recently in its search for
additional sources of production and has said it wants to increase
its oil and gas reserves by 700 million barrels.
   Jim Henderson, an oil analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said
Enterprise would be a logical target for Elf. But he said such a
bid is unlikely now, given the Middle East crisis that has sent
crude oil prices soaring.

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union members at a General
Motors Corp. parts plant returned to their jobs Wednesday after a
six-day strike that idled several other GM plants.
   GM spokesman John Maciarz said the company was happy to have the
work force back and was gearing up production at its AC Rochester
West plant.
   Parts shortages caused by the strike have halted production at
eight car and truck assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio, Louisiana
and Indiana, GM said. Manufacturing also was curtailed at a variety
of component factories.
   Workers at assembly plants in Flint and Oakland County, Mich.,
were recalled late Tuesday, leaving six plants shut down Wednesday,
Maciarz said.
   By Wednesday afternoon, Maciarz said, about 16,800 people were
still on layoff because of the strike.
   ``I'm sure there are going to be more callbacks tomorrow and
more Friday,'' he said Wednesday. ``We also might see another plant
or two go out for a short period of time.''
   Production at the assembly plants will gear up through next week
toward their pre-strike capacities. Maciarz said he didn't know
when each affected plant would return to normal production.
   The contract ratified Tuesday calls on GM to maintain the
current work force level at the Flint factory for the next six
years. Workers were concerned GM would turn to outside, non-union
companies to supply some of the grilles or fuel tanks made at the
factory.
   Job security is also the top issue in national contract
negotiations going on in Detroit between the UAW and GM, Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. The three national contracts, to replace
those expiring Sept. 14, will cover more than 450,000 workers total.
   After the Flint agreement was ratified, local union leaders
hailed its job security language just as national leaders did three
years ago when the current GM-UAW agreement was signed.
   That contract permitted the automaker to close a plant only when
sales of its products slumped badly. Since then, GM has closed four
assembly plants, prompting UAW charges of betrayal.
   The union unsuccessfully challenged one of the closings before
an arbitrator.
   This time, things will be different, said Mike Grimes, shop
chairman for UAW Local 659 in Flint.
   ``We're going to keep their feet to the fire,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Ford Motor Co. assembly plants will
be idle next week because of a lack of dealer orders and interior
material, the company said Wednesday.
   Assembly plants in Atlanta and Kansas City will be closed
because of low dealer orders. The Atlanta plant produces Ford
Taurus and Mercur Sable cars and the Kansas City plant makes Ford
Tempo and Mercury Topaz cars.
   Ford also said this week's shutdown of its Lorain, Ohio, plant
would be extended through next week because of a shortage of
interior trim materials. Spokesman Joel Pitcoff said the company
received more orders for a particular interior trim package than
anticipated, resulting in the shortage.
   The Lorain plant makes Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars.
   The shutdowns affect about 2,500 hourly employees in Atlanta,
2,300 workers in Kansas City and about 2,700 in Lorain.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Volatile As Mideast News Breaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures were mixed Wednesday, as news
of the tense Middle East standoff continued to affect trading.
   ``It's a nervous market,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It's very volatile on
headlines. Any kind of news that comes up, there's wild swings or
trends.''
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark grade of crude, closed at $26.46 per 42-gallon barrel, 4
cents above Tuesday's close of $26.42. Crude futures for later
months were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, the price of crude fell as traders speculated
that Jordanian King Hussein's visit Thursday with President Bush
could lead to a peaceful settlement in the Persian Gulf. Oil prices
have increased since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   September crude dropped as low as $25.60 per 42-gallon barrel
before swinging up on news that OPEC member nations might not hold
an emergency meeting to discuss higher production.
   Prices later tumbled on a report that Saudi Arabia may be
willing to raise OPEC production to 22.5 million barrels per day.
That would make up about 3.5 million of the 4 million barrels kept
off the market each day by the international boycott of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plans an
emergency meeting this week to discuss the possibility of boosting
production. OPEC has not yet announced a date and location for its
meeting. But Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said Tuesday
that the cartel hoped to make oil decisions by the end of the week.
   Venezuela's acting foreign minister, Adolfo Raul Taylhardat,
told reporters in that country Wednesday that Iraq will be allowed
to participate in the meeting.
   ``Iraq is a member of OPEC, and has the right to participate in
any of its meetings,'' he said.
   Other petroleum futures on the Merc were mixed.
   Home heating oil for September closed at 72.85 cents per gallon,
or .12 cent lower than Tuesday. Later months were also down.
   The September contract for unleaded gasoline rose 1.32 cents per
gallon to 84.05 cents. Future contracts were mixed.
   Natural gas for September fell from $1.448 to $1.428 per 1,000
cubic feet.

   Stock prices rose modestly Wednesday in light
trading, boosted by moderating oil prices and signs that the
Mideast crisis may be easing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose a slight 0.50
point to 2,748.27.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
887 up, 619 down and 494 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.21 million
shares, up from 130.32 million in Tuesday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 161.14 million shares.
   Analysts said the market reacted favorably to the visit by
Jordan's King Hussein to the United States. Hussein was carrying a
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to President Bush. The
king was scheduled to meet with Bush on Thursday.
   Stock prices initially spurted on expectations that some
breakthrough was imminent in the Mideast, traders said, sending the
Dow 22 points higher in the first half hour of trading.
   When no breakthrough materialized, prices moved lower and ``the
market settled down to something that was more reflective of what's
going on in the market itself,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior
market specialist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   The market received boosts when oil prices declined and
government bond prices rose, though trading in both markets was
choppy.
   ``It's been playing tag all day with bond prices and oil
prices,'' Murphy said.
   Speculation that the Mideast tension might be easing prompted a
stock rally in Japan before the domestic market opened. The key
index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, closed 5.4 percent
higher. Stock prices also gained in London.
   Among most-active blue-chip issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris
rose { to 47\, Boeing gained &rsqb; to 52&rsqb;, IBM rose | to 105 and
General Electric fell } to 66\.
   Wal-Mart was the most-active NYSE issue, falling \ to 30\ as
2.03 million shares changed hands. The retailer said it knew of no
reason for the activity, which it said was not that much greater
than normal trading in the stock.
   Among other active issues, AmBase plunged 4} to 2}. The
financial holding company, which announced Tuesday it would sell
its insurance unit, said it was unlikely that it would pay a
special dividend that had been promised to shareholders from the
proceeds.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew $6.652 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.44 to 186.54.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.54 to 401.38, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.67 to 340.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.12 to 411.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 0.70 to 340.64.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Repayment, Fines, in Business Week Insider Trading
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A print shop worker and stockbroker who
teamed up to buy stocks based on tips in Business Week before the
magazine hit the street were ordered Wednesday to repay $28,655 and
were fined $37,444.
   The rulings against stockbroker Brian J. Callahan and print
quality control analyst William N. Jackson were issued by U.S.
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in a civil insider trading case
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Wilson also entered a permanent injunction barring Callahan, 30,
of Anaheim, from further securities law violations.
   Callahan and Jackson, 34, of Long Beach, were convicted by a
jury in May of insider trading in more than 53 stocks in 1987 and
1988. Jackson made $19,507 in personal profit, while Callahan made
$1,148 in personal profit and $8,000 in commissions.
   Wilson ordered them to repay those amounts and fined Jackson
$10,000 and Callahan $27,444.57 _ three time his personal profit
and commissions.
   Neither the printing company, R.R. Donnelly and Sons, nor
Business Week was a defendant.
   SEC attorney Jeffrey Zuckerman said Jackson reviewed a new copy
of the magazine every Wednesday night at a printing plant in
suburban Torrance. He then phoned Callahan, a Prudential Bache
broker, the next morning to buy stocks recommended in the ``Inside
Wall Street'' column.
   The stock prices would tend to rise later as buyers entered the
market after reading the information.
   Jackson testified he didn't realize he was breaking the law or
confidentiality requirements of his company. Callahan testified
that he thought Jackson got his stock tips from a computer.
   Both men have lost their jobs. Their lawyer, Joseph Connolly,
had accused the SEC of stretching the securities laws ``almost
beyond recognition'' to cover a marginal violation.

   The dollar bounced higher Wednesday against the
German mark in U.S. dealings after sinking to an all-time low
against the mark in Europe.
   Against other major currencies, the dollar finished mixed in
domestic trading after falling broadly overseas.
   Gold prices turned lower after rising in recent sessions due to
worries about war and inflation resulting from actions in the
Persian Gulf.
   The dollar sank to a record closing low of 1.5605 marks in
Europe, down from 1.5685 marks late Tuesday and below its previous
trading low of 1.5615 marks on Jan. 4, 1988.
   Dealers said the dollar drifted even lower as trading got
underway in New York with the currency dropping to about 1.5540
marks early in the session.
   But the dollar retraced some lost ground in the afternoon
session in New York as some traders sold other currencies to cash
in on their recent rise, said John McCarthy, chief currency dealer
at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank.
   ``We have seen some classic profit-taking this afternoon,'' he
said from his New York office. ``People got tired of selling
dollars.''
   By late afternoon in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5660
marks, up from 1.5645 marks late Tuesday.
   Despite the recovery against the mark, McCarthy said he does not
think the sentiment toward the dollar has changed. ``It was just
oversold against almost all currencies and many participants were
short dollars,'' he said.
   The fundamental conditions that have caused the dollar to
decline over the past few weeks should continue to depress the
currency, he said.
   Many analysts say weakness in the U.S. economy will eventually
force the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to avoid a
recession just as Germany, Japan and other nations boost their
rates to curb inflation.
   The net effect will be to make the dollar less attractive to
foreign investors, currency analysts say.
   The dollar has also been hurt by indications the Middle East
crisis might be winding down. Jordan's King Hussein traveled to
Washington for talks with President Bush, reportedly carrying a
letter from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and remains there despite protests
from other nations around the world.
   Besides rising against the mark, the dollar gained ground
against the Swiss franc, French franc and Italian lire in New York
while falling against the Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian
dollar.
   In New York, the dollar fell to 147.65 Japanese yen from 148.85
yen late Tuesday. Earlier, it fell to 147.15 yen in Tokyo from
149.90 yen at Tuesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at
147.15 yen.
   The dollar also fell worldwide against the British pound. The
pound rose to $1.9000 in New York from $1.8970 late Tuesday. In
London, the pound rose to $1.9045 from $1.8930 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates as of 4 p.m. EDT in New York, compared with
late rates Tuesday, included: 1.30735 Swiss francs, up from 1.3042;
5.2570 French francs, up from 5.2555; 1,149.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,149.25; and 1.14345 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14425.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late rates,
included: 1.3005 Swiss francs, down from 1.3055; 5.2365 French
francs, down from 5.2695; 1.7579 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7675;
1,145.75 Italian lire, down from 1,152.50, and 1.1435 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1452.
   Gold prices dropped worldwide in response to an apparent decline
in tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold for current delivery fell $2.20 to $402.60 a troy ounce on
the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank quoted a
bid for an ounce of gold at $402.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $1.60
from Tuesday's late bid.
   Earlier, gold fell to $401.25 a troy ounce in London from
$410.25 late Tuesday and to $398.75 an ounce in Zurich from from
$412 late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $9.50 to $401.50 an
ounce.
   On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery fell 12.3
cents an ounce to $5.068. Silver bullion fell to $5.12 an ounce in
London from $5.28 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Time Warner Suspends Publication of French Version of Fortune</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. has suspended publication of
Fortune France, the French language version of Fortune magazine
that it has published since early 1988 in partnership with Hachette
Filipacchi Group.
   A spokeswoman for Fortune said the move resulted from
differences between the partners over the magazine's editorial
direction.
   ``Hachette was looking for more of a lifestyle magazine, while
Marshall Loeb said it should be more consistent with the business
direction of Fortune,'' said Emma Dockendorff, the spokeswoman for
Fortune.
   Loeb is the managing editor of the U.S. edition of Fortune and
had veto power over stories that appeared in the French edition.
   She said Fortune is pursuing talks with others about new
foreign-language editions, however.
   She said Fortune is in negotiations about the possibility of
publishing a Spanish-language edition of Fortune and a Fortune
Benelux edition that would be in Dutch or Flemish for distribution
in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. She declined to say who
Fortune was talking with.
   ``We are disappointed about the need to close (Fortune France)
but we feel confident about our editorial direction,'' Ms.
Dockendorff said.
   She said Fortune International, an English-language version of
Fortune distributed overseas, recently increased its circulation
guarantee to 115,000 from 105,000.
   Time Warner has published an Italian-language version of
Fortune, Fortune Italia, as a joint venture with Arnaldo Mondadori
Editore since April 1989 and that magazine is doing well, Ms.
Dockendorff said.
   On the domestic front, Time Warner's magazine division confirmed
Wednesday that it will publish two test issues of a woman's
magazine developed with author and home entertainment stylist
Martha Stewart.
   The first issue of the magazine, which is being called Martha
Stewart Living, will be put on newsstands in mid-November and focus
on holiday entertaining and family holiday activities, according to
Time Inc. Magazines spokesman Peter Costiglio.
   The second issue will appear on newsstands in mid-March and
focus on spring activities and Easter holiday entertaining.
   Costiglio said 500,000 copies of each issue would be distributed
and a judgment would be made afterwards on whether to continue
publishing.
   Meantime, Sports Illustrated said it is planning to pubish three
special issues in 1991 of a sports nostalgia magazine, tentatively
called Sports Illustrated Classic. It would be distributed to
Sports Illustrated subscribers and sold on newsstands.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rebound, End Higher as Brazilian News Becomes
Clear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices posted modest gains Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a trading session enlivened by
conflicting reports about the size of a Brazilian agricultural loan
program.
   On other commodity markets, grain futures also advanced; oil
futures were mixed; precious metals retreated; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 2\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with
the contract for August delivery at $6.13 a bushel.
   The contract tumbled from near its opening level of $6.10{ to
$6.02{ at midday after a report that the Brazilian government would
make available to farmers the equivalent of $6.3 billion in loans
for the planting season beginning in September.
   The amount was much higher than last year's $4 billion program.
The report immediately prompted speculation that next year's
soybean crop from Brazil, the world's second-largest producer,
would be larger than many analysts had been anticipating.
   But soybean prices rebounded a little later on another report
that Brazilian President Ferdinand Collor de Mello had announced
the amount would be the equivalent of $4.2 billion, which was in
line with market expectations.
   Wheat futures were strong all day, partly reflecting farmers'
reluctance to sell wheat at current prices.
   ``Prices are so darn low, they're just sitting on the stuff,''
said Katharina Zimmer, a grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Captial
Markets Inc. in New York.
   Wheat futures settled 4{ cents to 5\ cents higher with September
at $2.84{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 2 cents higher with
September at $2.47{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher
with September at $1.16} a bushel.
   Crude oil futures finished little changed on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after a day of up-and-down trading tied to
developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Prices slumped early in the day amid hopes that Jordan's Kind
Hussein was bringing an Iraqi peace proposal to President Bush.
   But crude prices recovered on reports that most OPEC members
were not inclined to discuss the possibility of increasing their
crude output to make up for the loss of Iraqi oil exports.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 28
cents higher with September at $26.46 a barrel; heating oil was .02
cent to .23 cent lower with September at 72.85 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to 1.32 cents higher with
September at 84.05 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures fell on New York's Commodity Exchange in
the absence of significant new developments in the Middle East.
   Gold futures ended $2.90 to $3 lower with August at $402.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 12.3 cents to 15.1 cents lower with August
at $5.068 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures ended narrowly mixed in lackluster
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .23 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August
at 78.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .25
cent higher with August at 90 cents a pound; live hogs were .08
cent lower to .75 cent higher with August at 56.87 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.3 cents lower to .13 cent higher with
August at 50.95 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Born in Bulgaria and raised in the
Midwest, Frank Popoff is just as comfortable steering Dow Chemical
Co. into Eastern Europe as he is steering chums into a Bloomington,
Ind., bar to reminisce about college.
   Popoff is a veteran of the chemical business in Dow's European
operations and travels there at least once a year. The president
and chief executive is at home in a changing Eastern Europe and its
fledgling free-market economy.
   ``But because we're old hands in that part of the world and have
been for many, many years, we're trying to be part of a process,
rather than part of the pyrotechnics of Eastern Europe newly
discovered by people who, a year ago, could have cared less,'' he
said.
   High-profile U.S. companies have plunged into Eastern Europe
over the past year, forming businesses ranging from auto assembly
plants to tourist hotels. But Dow's been there since the 1960s,
originally as a trader with all the East bloc countries and more
recently as a partner in a Hungarian styrofoam factory.
   Global operations are part of a broader strategy Popoff helped
devise to tame boom-and-bust cycles in the chemical industry. He's
also pushed Dow into new technologies, pharmaceuticals and consumer
products ranging from oven cleaner to Saran Wrap, which sell
regardless of the economy's health.
   He said the biggest challenge is trying to persuade consumers
that Dow's products can be used without harming the environment.
   ``There are no chlorofluorocarbons in these cups any more,''
Popoff said in an interview, picking up a white styrofoam coffee
cup from a dark wood conference table.
   ``We have to be a player in the Earth Day scenario,'' he said.
``We'll either have to meet this challenge or revise our growth
rates for the industry.''
   A 50 percent slump in second-quarter earnings proved the
country's second-largest chemical company behind Dupont isn't yet
immune to industry cycles.
   Prices for plastics and chemical products weakened, raw material
costs stayed high, and production outages at several plants
contributed to the decline.
   Popoff and other Dow officials predict a gradually improving
economy still will give Dow with its best year in sales and
third-best year in profits.
   ``Dow is like a baseball player who hits .300 year in and year
out,'' said David Sowerby, vice president and economist at
Manufacturers National Bank in Detroit.
   Of the second quarter earnings, he said: ``Even .300 hitters go
into temporary slumps. The economy is weak and they can't escape
that. They still look good fundamentally.''
   Although developments in Europe are of particular interest to
Popoff, he said the area remains mired in bureaucracy and central
planning that make the area relatively unattractive to foreign
investors.
   ``The Pacific Rim is, I think, the growth area for the next
decade,'' Popoff said. Dow has growing operations in Japan,
Thailand, Korea and China.
   Popoff, 54, succeeded Vienna-born Paul F. Oreffice as president
and CEO in 1987 after success with European operations. Oreffice
remains chairman.
   ``He did a good job of achieving a low-cost production position
in Europe, and that's why they brought him over here,'' said
industry analyst Fred H. Siemer of Chemical Research for Wall
Street. ``He understands the global nature of the business.''
   The global outlook came to Popoff naturally. His family left
Bulgaria when he was a child, amid turmoil of Hitler's Nazi
expansion. His father ran an import-export business.
   The Popoffs emigrated to Terre Haute, Ind., in 1940. Popoff's
father operated a dry-cleaning business, Popoff attended high
school, and the family became U.S. citizens.
   Popoff graduated Indiana University in Bloomington with a
bachelor's degree in chemistry and a master's degree in business
administration, both in 1959. He returns for alumni activities and
advisory committee meetings and is an active alumnus of Sigma Chi,
his college social fraternity.
   ``Frank is a very valued counselor for me,'' said Jack
Wentworth, dean of the university's School of Business. Dow hires
many university graduates and funds scholarships at the school.
   Wentworth said Popoff also relishes meeting old friends like
John Peterson, now chairman of City Securities Corp. in
Indianapolis. ``When they get together they act like classmates and
they go back to their old local pub.''
   ``We'll go back to Nick's Old English Pub for old memories,''
Peterson said. ``They don't check us for IDs anymore, they just
look at us funny because we have a tie. The students are looking
very young.''
   Popoff strikes many as urbane and humble at the same time,
perhaps a reflection of his success.
   ``He's not phony,'' Wentworth said. ``He doesn't come on like he
knows it all. He's the kind of person you'd like if he was the
janitor.''

<HEAD>Study Predicts Petroleum Companies to Spend Billions to
Reformulate Gasoline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tighter controls against air pollution will push
petroleum companies to devise new formulas for nearly all the
gasoline sold in America by the end of the century, according to a
study released Wednesday.
   The study by the Arthur D. Little management consulting firm
predicts domestic refiners will spend up to $22 billion to alter
their gasoline. One result would be higher gasoline prices.
   The changes would mark the most significant shift in gasoline
production since companies started making unleaded fuel in the
1970s, said Carlton Jones, who helped write the study.
   A driving force behind the change will be legislation to amend
the federal Clean Air Act, Jones said. Both the U.S. House and
Senate have approved bills that would require companies to
reformulate their gasoline. The goal is to reduce emissions of
pollutants such as carbon monoxide.
   The legislation would require reformulated gasoline to be sold
in nine metropolitan areas that represent about 21 percent of the
nation's population, Jones said. Those areas, which have high ozone
concentrations, are New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Hartford,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Houston and San Diego.
   The requirement would take effect in 1993, but other forces
could lead the movement to spread around the country, Jones said.
For example, distributors might face logistical problems if they
try to continue providing gasoline made under current formulas,
while at the same time providing the reformulated product.
   Also, petroleum companies might broaden the sale of reformulated
gasoline as a competitive wedge.
   ``If one company advertises that its reformulated gas burns more
cleanly, consumers might want to buy that,'' Jones said.
   Some companies already have begun to change their formulas.
Shell Oil Co. introduced a new gasoline formula this year in the
nine areas targeted by the federal legislation, said Norman
Altstedter, a company spokesman.
   Altstedter acknowledged there was a ``competitive aspect'' to
the company's decision, but he said ``our first thing is to help
improve air quality.''
   But the petroleum industry objects to the legislation proposed
in Congress.
   ``Our position is the government should not be writing formulas
for gasoline,'' said R.G. Ensz, spokesman for the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association.
   ``The government should set certain air quality goals and let
the auto and petroleum industries figure out how to meet those
goals,'' he said.
   Along those lines, automobile and oil companies have joined to
conduct a comprehensive study of cleaner burning fuels, Ensz said.
   He predicted some small refiners could be put out of business if
the government adopts ``unworkable formulas.''
   The study itself says the ``investments required to meet tighter
environmental standards may be unprofitable for refiners.''
   To make the new formulas, companies would not simply be able to
adjust current operations but would have to install new processing
equipment ``that refiners don't usually have,'' Jones said.
   The study predicts reformulated gasoline will cost consumers an
additional 7 to 12 cents per gallon.
   The study also looked at the European market, but predicted the
push for new gasoline formulas will proceed more slowly there. This
is partly because the United State has been more active in imposing
strict emissions requirements and also because Europe has less
severe smog problems.
   Another variable in the equation, however, is the political
crisis in the Middle East. Jones said he did not expect the crisis
would have much effect, although an extended drop in oil supplies
could delay implementation of federal regulations.

<HEAD>Arco Extends Freeze on Wholesale Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Wednesday it was
extending a freeze on wholesale gasoline, diesel and jet fuel
prices enacted in response to a call by President Bush for
restraint during the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Arco, which sells gasoline at 1,500 stations in five Western
states, was the first oil company to announce a freeze after pump
prices increased sharply after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The company, based in Los Angeles, said there was no time on the
extension but it would review prices daily. Crude oil prices have
risen only slightly since the one-week freeze was announced, and
pump prices have stabilized as well.
   Arco spokesman Doug Elmets said the company's demand volume has
increased 10 percent at the pump since the price freeze was
announced.
   The freeze applies only to the price of fuel sold to wholesalers
and not retailers. The company has asked its retail distributors to
keep a hold on pump prices.
   Arco sells gasoline in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington state.
   Bush called for price restraint by oil companies after
widespread allegations of price gouging at the pumps to take
advantage of the instability in the Middle East.

<HEAD>Continental to Match Other Airlines and Cut Fall Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said Wednesday it will cut
fares for flights after Labor Day, matching reductions already
announced by several other major carriers.
   The carrier said it will lower its discount fares for fall
vacation travel in the continental United States by an average of
30 percent.
   Continental said the lowered fares will be exempt from a pending
5.3 percent increase that the carrier and several others plan to
implement in about a week to defray the rising costs of jet fuel.
   The Houston-based airline's reduced fares apply to round-trip
tickets purchased by Aug. 29 for travel between Sept. 5 and Dec.
16, excluding the five days around Thanksgiving.
   On Tuesday, United, Northwest and American offered lower fares
in response to the post-Labor Day fare cuts announced Monday by
Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
   The 5.3 percent fare increases were to have gone into effect
Wednesday, but Continental, United Airlines and Northwest Airlines
said they were delaying the hike until Aug. 22. American postponed
it until Aug. 23.
   The carriers said they were taking the action for competitive
reasons and that the delay meant they would absorb higher fuel
costs for the time being.

<HEAD>City Casinos Post First-Ever Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>

   The casino industry here posted a
loss in the busy April through June period for the first time in
its 12-year history, according to figures released Wednesday.
   The loss came despite a 10.7 percent increase in gross revenue
generated by the April opening of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort.
   Overall, the industry lost $1.2 million on gross revenue of
$884.2 million in the second quarter, according to figures released
by the Casino Association of New Jersey. During the same period
last year, the city's 12 casinos earned $21.9 million on gross
revenue of $798.8 million.
   Half the casinos posted losses in the second quarter, with the
Taj Mahal posting the steepest loss _ $14.4 million on gross
revenue of $126 million.
   ``Although the Taj Mahal has produced an expansion of the
market, it has not been enough to offset its impact on the rest of
the industry,'' said association president Thomas Carver.
   However, only two gaming halls _ Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino
and Caesars Atlantic City Hotel and Casino _ had earnings that
amounted to more than 5 percent of their revenues. The 5 percent
mark is considered a barometer of success in the industry.
   One bright spot for the industry was found in Merv Griffin's
Resorts Casino Hotel, which recorded a net profit of $2.7 million
on gross revenue of $59.2 million.
   Resorts, which is trying to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, is adjacent to the Taj Mahal. Company
officials hoped that interest in the Taj would lure patrons to
Resorts.
   Showboat Hotel Casino, situated on the other side of the Taj
Mahal, posted a loss of $1.7 million on gross revenue of $71.4
million.
   Trump's other properties had mixed results in the three months
since the April 2 opening of the Taj Mahal.
   Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had a profit of $876,000 on gross
revenue of $83.4 million while Trump Castle Casino Resort By The
Bay lost $8.1 million on gross revenue of $63.4 million.
   The other four casinos that posted profits were:
   Caesars, $4.1 million profit on $77.7 million revenue; Bally's
Park Place Casino Hotel, $3.4 million profit on $82.3 million in
revenue; Harrah's Marina, $15 million profit on revenue of $80.5
million; and Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino, $1.7 million profit on
revenue of $56.2 million.
   The three othere casinos to post losses were:
   Sands Hotel &amp; Casino, which lost $1.7 million on $66 million in
revenue; Claridge Hotel and Casino, which lost $842,000 on revenue
of $39.6 million; and TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort,
which lost $2.2 million on revenue of $78.6 million.

   Donald Trump owes $3.2 billion to
banks, $69.5 milion to subcontractors who helped build the Taj
Mahal casino and is involved in 111 court cases, according to
documents released Wednesday.
   The documents also reveal that several of Trump's marquee
properties, including the Taj Mahal and the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan, may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than
he claims.
   The asset analysis by the firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. was among
documents released by the state Casino Control Commission in
advance of hearings Thursday and Friday over a $65 million rescue
plan Trump reached with creditors in June.
   The papers _ which Trump unsuccessfully fought to keep private _
give some of the most detailed information yet about the troubled
developer's holdings and the rescue plan.
   They also cover such matters as lawsuits and other court action
by aggrieved parties ranging from his estranged wife Ivana to the
New Jersey State Funeral Directors.
   Under the rescue plan, Trump gave up substantial control of his
real estate and hotel empire in exchange for a debt restructuring
that kept his holdings out of bankruptcy.
   Leventhal's report, based on figures as of April 30, said Trump
controlled $4.6 billion in assets with a market value of $3.7
billion to $3.9 billion and a short-term liquidation value of $2.9
billion to $3.5 billion.
   The severity of Trump's financial problems began surfacing in
June, after he missed a $43 million payment on bonds used to
finance Trump Castle Casino Resort By the Bay and payments on a $30
million bank loan.
   The documents state that Trump has outstanding debts of $3.2
billion to lending institutions, including $933 million to Citibank.
   Trump already has pledged his three Atlantic City casinos _
Trump Castle, the Taj Mahal Casino Resort and Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino _ as collateral for new loans granted under the rescue plan.
   Trump put up his equity in the Taj Mahal as a guarantee of an
existing $75 million loan by First Fidelity Bancorp.; his equity in
Trump Castle to secure an existing $13 million loan by Midlantic
Bank; and his equity in Trump Plaza to secure a $19.6 million
letter of credit from National Westminster Bancorp.
   The restructuring also defers payments on some of the
outstanding bonds for the three casinos and his Manhattan
properties for three and five years.
   Trump spokesman Norma Foerderer said Trump would have no comment
on the documents.
   A cover letter on the on the report prepared for Trump's lenders
by Leventhal asked the commission to keep details of the
restructuring plan confidential.
   ``This report contains highly confidential and sensitive
information which is vital to Donald J. Trump,'' the letter said.
``Dissemination or disclosure of any or all the contents of this
report could adversely affect those interests.''
   The rescue plan also requires Trump to sell some assets to raise
cash, although there has been speculation that such transactions
could amount to a ``fire sale'' because some values were depressed.
   The major assets listed by Trump, with the value he assigns to
them, the going market rate estimated by Leventhal and the
short-term liquidation value estimated by Leventhal were:
   _ Taj Mahal and adjacent land: $1.06 billion, $767.5 million,
and $740.7 million.
   _ Trump Plaza, the land under it and the adjacent land: $647.8
million, $555.2 million to $655.2 million, and between $412.4
million and $642.4 million.
   _ Trump Castle: $571.5 million, $400 million to $460 million,
and $300 million to $350 million.
   _ The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan: $830 million, $450 million to
$550 million, and $413.2 million to $500 million.
   _ The Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan: $150 million, $90 million
to $110 million, and $80 million to $100 million.
   _ The Trump Shuttle airline: $340 million, $340 million, and
$150 million to $300 million.
   Also included was a 29-page list of 111 legal matters involving
Trump. They included lawsuits filed by Ivana Trump and by former
securities analyst Marvin Roffman, who claimed he was fired due to
complaints by Trump. Another complaint was filed by the New Jersey
State Funeral Directors charging an alleged breach of a booking
agreement at a Trump casino.
   Trump also owes $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors who worked
on the Taj Mahal on projects from installing minarets and
chandeliers to bathroom fixtures. The subcontractors who have not
sued Trump for payment are negotiating with him for payment.
   Trump's attorneys lost an appeal Wednesday to keep the documents
sealed. State Supreme Court Justice Alan Handler upheld a two-judge
appellate panel's decision, rejecting Trump's argument that release
of the documents would cause him undue harm.

<HEAD>FundAmerica Inc. Will File Bankruptcy, Attorneys Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH GROAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge Wednesday extended an order
freezing the assets of FundAmerica Inc., but refused to appoint a
receiver to protect the marketing company's assets until bankruptcy
papers are filed Thursday.
   The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Marilyn
Hall Patel was similar to a temporary restraining order that froze
the assets last month.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs in a $150 million class-action
lawsuit asked Patel to appoint a receiver for the company, but were
denied.
   Patel said that since FundAmerica's attorneys said they plan to
seek protection from creditors while reorganizing under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws Thursday, a receiver is unnecessary.
   ``I don't intend to appoint a receiver for a day, a dubious
position and just one more person who will have to be paid from the
funds of FundAmerica,'' she said.
   Receivers are appointed by judges to manage troubled companies
until a court rules on claims brought against the firm.
   She said the preliminary injunction freezing assets would remain
in effect until a trustee is appointed by bankruptcy court to run
the company's affairs.
   Company founder and former president Robert Edwards is charged
in Florida with fraud for allegedly bilking club members out of
$8.2 million in an illegal pyramid scheme.
   FundAmerica sold memberships in a discount buying club that
offered rebates on services such as MCI long-distance calls and a
range of consumer products. Various levels of memberships were sold
through network marketing and multi-level sales.
   Attorneys in four states _ Florida, Washington, Texas and
California _ have alleged FundAmerica may have run a pyramid scheme
by selling multiple memberships to club members that they in turn
could sell. The company maintains it is a legitimate consumer
buying club.
   The class action suit seeks compensation for an undetermined
number of members who did not recoup their total investment in the
club. Patel certified the class in the suit on Wednesday.
