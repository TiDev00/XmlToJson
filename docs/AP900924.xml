   Fifth Avenue Phyllis, known as Fifth Avenue Phil
until the birth of her three babies, is the only groundhog ever to
move voluntarily into the Central Park Zoo. But now this very
social animal is missing - or worse.
   The outgoing woodchuck, who scampers up to people outside her
hole under the Children's Zoo and begs for Italian ice, hot dogs
and pretzels, has been gone almost two months. Some of her friends
are sure she was killed by a car.
   ``We're still holding out hope,'' zookeeper Herb Clement said
Monday. ``She's been gone before. She's not your everyday
groundhog.''
   The plump brown beast first made the pages of The New York Times
in 1985, when she dug a hole near a driveway at the Children's Zoo
and set up housekeeping.
   Clement called it ``a case of reverse adoption,'' and, ignorant
of the groundhog's sex, dubbed her Fifth Avenue Phil.
   The groundhog may have been attracted by a crab apple tree that
dropped its fruit on the driveway, and by the grass and weeds in
front of the zoo entrance. But far better eating, the beast soon
realized, was hers for the asking.
   ``Groundhogs can get used to people after awhile, but she really
stepped forward,'' Clement recalled. ``She'd walk out among the
crowds and literally join them for lunch.''
   But it wasn't just the food; this groundhog was truly
gregarious.
   ``She would walk right up to you, rise up on her hind legs, and
rest her paws on your leg,'' said Virginia Ferguson, a neighborhood
resident.
   ``She was a New Yorker first,'' Clement agreed, ``and a
groundhog second. She wasn't even afraid of dogs.''
   A woman known to zoo regulars as the Groundhog Lady taught
Phyllis to come out of her burrow on cue and perform tricks. She
would sit on the woman's lap and hold a banana as the woman peeled
it; she would beg on her hind legs for bits of cookie.
   Phyllis delighted her admirers with a litter of three pups, then
chilled them by the ruthlessness with which all groundhogs root
their brood out of the hole.
   Phyllis again made the Times in 1987, when Clement wrote a
letter to the editor citing ``the remarkable groundhog Phyllis'' as
an example of ``New York City's native wildlife.''
   The woodchuck, he explained, had gone far beyond her species'
traditional claim to fame - the prediction of winter's length - and
became ``the only groundhog to have voluntarily taken up residence
in a zoo.''
   Phyllis became a bigger attraction than most of the animals who
joined the zoo involuntarily. ``People come by to look for her, and
if she isn't around, they want to know why,'' Clement said.
``They're quite insistent.''
   Whenever there was a parade on Fifth Avenue, Phyllis would walk
along the wall between the avenue and the park, looking for
leftovers.
   But the groundhog disappeared at the end of July, and on Aug. 16
Virginia Ferguson's husband, Donald, was jogging in the park when
he saw the body of a groundhog in the road. It had been run over;
it was, he believed, Phyllis.
   Mrs. Ferguson wrote this announcement and posted it near the
gate:
   ``To those watching for her
   She is gone
   She was killed by a car
   We all miss her.''
   Mrs. Ferguson also spent $75 on a 5-by-7-foot black and silver
plaque that will be placed this week on a wall near the groundhog's
old hole.
   It reads: ``In affectionate tribute to a remarkably friendly and
tame groundhog. The original Fifth Avenue Phyllis.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   The word gentrification, which comes from
gentry, or the British landowner class, can mean investment and
restoration in old neighborhoods. But to those displaced by higher
rents and changing styles, it also can mean the end of home. This
third part of a continuing series, ``City Faces-City Fears,'' looks
at what gentrification has meant to one family.

   In another time, returning home from
work at the docks in Fox Point could take hours because everybody
knew everybody in the waterfront neighborhood settled by
descendants of Old World seafarers.
   On a summer afternoon, there might have been time to sit on a
neighbor's porch for an iced tea, or for a stop at Manny Almedia's
Ringside Tap for a sausage sandwich and a beer.
   In those days, relatives and friends followed early immigrants
across the Atlantic from Portugal or the Portuguese-speaking Cape
Verde islands off West Africa, to live in cold-water tenements.
Extended families lived together, father and mother on one floor,
children and grandchildren on another.
   Ah, those were the days for the Britto brothers, whose father
came to the United States in 1915 to work as a stevedore.
   John Britto, who was born in Fox Point 57 years ago and never
moved more than a half mile, doesn't use the word gentrification,
but that's what he's talking about when he says sadly, ``You don't
know your neighbors anymore.''
   In the 1970s and '80s, the old Fox Point gave way to a new one.
Neighboring Brown University purchased property there, and a
combination of yuppies, real estate speculators and historic
preservationists bought many of the houses with government tax
credits, renovated them and sent the prices up by as much as
tenfold.
   Not only could working-class renters no longer afford their old
neighborhood, in some cases, they could barely recognize it.
   Along Wickenden Street, the main street, Manny Almedia's was
turned into The Cafe at Brooke's, offering pepper provolone quiche
and California burgers with avocado and cheddar.
   ``My landlord had raised our rent the first time, which wasn't
bad,'' explained John Britto. But in 1980, the block where he and
his wife and six children lived was rezoned from residential to
business, and the landlord was back.
   ``All of a sudden, he wanted to put a lawyer's office in his
tenement and he raised it where I couldn't afford it - maybe a
couple of hundred more. This is what they're doing. It happened to
all of us.''
   By sheer persistence and with help from friends and politicians,
Britto and his family managed to stay - ``my roots are here,'' he
said - taking over a three-story tenement house marked for
demolition by the city Redevelopment Authority and fixing it up.
   But two of his brothers, Sylvester, 53, and Vincent, 64, had to
move when their landlords raised the rents.
   After living in a triple-decker house for 22 years with his wife
and three children, Sylvester and two other families were asked to
move five years ago. The landlord told them he was redoing the
house and would let them know when it wasfinished. They never
heard from him again.
   In another neighborhood across town, Sylvester found a place for
his family to live. ``I was one of the lucky ones,'' he said. ``The
people downstairs had to go live with a daughter.''
   Even so, he added, ``I don't do nothing up here. I go to Fox
Point.''
   As for Vincent Britto, even though he still misses his old
neighborhood after 14 years, he wouldn't move back today. He'd feel
lost.
   ``It's not like it used to be,'' he said. ``All you had to do
was come out of your house, you'll see someone you know. It's all
strangers there now.''
   But the Cape Verdeans do come back once in a while, gathering in
the Fox Point Boys Club, recapturing the memories and their youth.
   On one such occasion, Vincent Britto looked around at the 25 men
sitting in the club, one of the last vestiges of the ethnic
neighborhood. Only two of the men still were living in Fox Point,
including his brother John.
   ``We meet once a month,'' John Britto said. ``They come to see
each other, to make sure everybody's OK. We talk about old times.
Sure, everything's changed. Some people say it changed for the
betterment of Fox Point, but I'm saying the faces change, the
people change. Most of the people that lived here are gone. They've
either moved or passed away.''
   As the men left, John Britto lingered, casting a lonely figure
across the empty auditorium floor.
   ``A lot of these guys, I won't see until next month,'' he said.
``Before, when we had the neighborhood, it was a warm feeling. We
would gather like every day. I miss the people. I miss a lot of
good friends.''
   No one knows for sure how many residents of Fox Point were
displaced. The 1980 census figures, the latest available, put the
neighborhood's total population at 5,499, but no breakdown by
ethnic group is available.
   In her book, ``The Immigration and the Settlement of the
Portuguese in Providence: 1890-1924,'' Susan Terry Ferst wrote that
during that era, Fox Point was about 50 percent Portuguese and Cape
Verdean.
   ``There's still a substantial number of Portuguese and Cape
Verdeans in Fox Point, but not nearly the large population as was
10 to 15 years ago,'' said Thomas Moses, director of planning and
development for the city of Providence.
   Most moved to more affordable areas as their old neighborhood
was renovated, Moses said.
   ``The biggest negative is that it fractured them as a group,''
he said.
   Some of the men at the Boys Club singled out Brown University,
saying it had bought up property and that its students had taken
over renting the renovated tenements, living three and four to a
house.
   Robert Reichley, vice president for university relations, said
that while Brown's wholly owned real estate subsidiary might buy
houses and rent them, their ultimate use is for educational
purposes, such as classrooms and research buildings.
   ``The impact that Brown had specifically was really in the
decade of the '60s and maybe into the middle '70s,'' he said. ``But
since that point, the impact of gentrification on Fox Point is
unmistakable, and it is not the result of Brown. It is the result
of people finding in many cases good real estate values which they
have then improved upon.''
   Along with higher property values have come upscale restaurants
and shops, but that's not what Fox Point's old residents return
for.
   Many times, the Cape Verdeans and Portuguese, who have scattered
into the suburbs of East Providence and Bristol, meet when there is
a death among them.
   ``And after that wake,'' says John Britto, ``it's `I'll see you
later at the next wake.' ''

   While gentrification has spurred downtown renaissance, it has
unintentionally wiped out low-income housing and contributed to
homelessness.
   The number of apartments renting for less than $250 a month
declined nationally from 9.7 million in 1970 to 7.9 million in
1985, according to a study released last year by the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based, non-profit
research organization.
   The number of renters with incomes of less than $10,000 annually
grew from 7.3 million to 11.6 million in the same period, the study
said.
   ``Taken together, that means that since 1970, there has been a
serious shortage in affordable housing,'' said Paul Leonard, the
report's principal author. ``Gentrification is one of a number of
factors that contributed.''
   Leonard said he is updating the report to include 1987 and that
his initial assessment shows that the housing shortage for
low-income people is about the same.
   Woody Widrow, editor of Shelterforce, the magazine of the
National Housing Institute in Orange, N.J., agreed.
   ``These units either were demolished, converted or rehabilitated
and were lost as low-income units,'' he said. ``When low-income
housing disappears, low-income renters are pushed into unaffordable
housing. Some proportion becomes homeless.''
   The upside of gentrification is that neighborhoods get fixed up,
said Phill Clay, an associate professor of city planning at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But that often doesn't help
the people who have lived there all along, often minorities.
   ``So they have to go somewhere else. Often they can't afford
it,'' Clay said, noting that cuts in government housing programs
have compounded problems caused by gentrification.
   Ian D. Spatz, an official of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in Washington, called gentrification ``one of the more
minor influences on urban neighborhoods.''
   ``Far more important,'' he said, ``is disinvestment, where poor
people of all races are removed from their housing because of lack
of maintenance and demolition for other purposes such as new
construction, highways, skyscrapers and public works projects of
one kind or another.''
   Spatz acknowledged that in some neighborhoods, such as
Georgetown in Washington, D.C., and Society Hill in Philadelphia,
poor people have been pushed out by the wealthy. But, he said, the
numbers are small.
   ``A much more important factor,'' he said, ``is that
neighborhoods are simply being neglected by a combination of
absenteeism ownership, sometimes city policies and sometimes by
residents themselves.''
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation is doing a great
deal to try to revitalize neighborhoods for existing residents,
Spatz said.
   He cited the Springfield neighborhood in Jacksonville, Fla.,
which he described as poor with high unemployment and already
substantial displacement from demolition.
   ``The National Trust has been involved in hundreds of projects
across the nation where historic housing is being rehabilitated for
continued low-income use,'' Spatz said. ``It's easy to try to make
wealthy people and historic preservationists out to be the bad
guys. The facts just don't support that.''

<HEAD>The Wind Could Carry Off the Energy Problem, These Visionaries Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Champions of a source of clean and abundant
energy blew into town today, arguing that America could live
contentedly without any country's oil if it only would harness the
wind.
   The American Wind Energy Association brought together 300
engineers, consultants, manufacturers, scientists - and visionaries
- to discuss the possibilities of using wind power to produce a
substantial percentage of the nation's electricity.
   Today the wind generates only a trifling fraction of the
nation's power.
   More than 15,000 wind turbines are in commercial use in
California, the world's pioneer in wind-generated electricity.
   They produce 2.2 billion kilowatts a year. That's the equivalent
of 3.5 million barrels of oil, somewhat less than half of one day's
imports.
   It's also about 1 percent of the electricity the state consumes,
or an amount equal to the power used in all the homes of San
Francisco.
   Wind, its advocates say, is domestic and abounding. The turbines
it turns emit no carbon dioxide, the villain in acid rain, o other
pollutants, and don't contribute to the greenhouse effect, the
warming of the atmosphere.
   According to Randall Swisher, executive director of the
association, a new study establishes ``the immense potential of
wind energy to meet America's energy needs.''
   The study said 1.5 percent of the area of the 48 contiguous
states have usable winds averaging 16 mph or more at 50 meters
above the ground, similar to the winds that turn California's
turbines.
   Such winds ``are being cost-effectively developed today using
current technology,'' Swisher said.
   He said only four states - Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and
Louisiana - lack ``commercial wind potential.''
   The study was conducted by Pacific Northwest Laboratories,
operated by Battelle Memorial Institute for the Energy Department.
   The wind association, capitalizing on concerns aroused by the
Persian Gulf crisis, sent its supporters to Capitol Hill to make
the case for wind power.
   Mike Marvin, director of government affairs, said the Energy
Department ``as a response to the Iraq-Kuwait situation'' had
considered proposing a subsidy of 2 cents per kilowatt hour for
wind-generated electricity, ``but the advice was not taken by the
White House.''
   Marvin said advocates would argue that wind-generated
electricity should be exempt from any energy tax Congress enacts.
   Asked if there are any downsides to tapping the winds, Marvin
said some people object to the eerie sight of miles and miles of
slowly turning turbines and some object to the noise they make. But
technological advances have made the turbines hardly more noisy
than the wind itself, he said.
   ``I happen to think it's beautiful to see the rows and rows of
wind turbines,'' he said.
   In addition to the areas with sustained winds averaging 16 mph
or more, Pacific Northwest Laboratories found that 14 percent of
the land area of the United States has winds averaging 14 mph or
more.
   Swisher said the next generation of wind turbines will make
development of those slower winds cost-effective by the late 1990s.
   When that happens, he said, America will be capable of producing
more electricity than it uses by relying solely on the wind.
   The report said California has developed only one-fifth of its
areas with 16 mph wind potential.
   Moreover, it said, California's wind potential is exceeded in 13
states - North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, Montana, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico
and Idaho. Three states - New York, Illinois and Michigan - have a
potential equal to California's.
   So far, renewable energy sources - geothermal, solar and wind
power - account for only a tiny fraction of the nation's energy
supply - one-quarter of one quadrillion BTUs of energy in 1987. The
country consumed 76 quadrillion in 1987.

<HEAD>Supervisors: Tear Down Quake Damaged Freeway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of bitter debate, the Board of
Supervisors recommended Monday that the earthquake-ruined
Embarcadero Freeway be torn down and replaced by a ground-level or
underground road.
   Many longtime residents saw the earthquake damage as an
opportunity to get rid of the elevated freeway, which blocks views
of San Francisco Bay and covers some prime real estate.
   But merchants have demanded speedy repairs for the road, which
serves Chinatown and the North Beach restaurant district.
   The resolution approved by the supervisors is strictly advisory
because the state and federal transportation departments have final
say on what to do about the 1.5-mile stretch of freeway -
Interstate 480 - that has been shut since the Oct. 17 earthquake
that damaged much of the city.
   ``I congratulate the board,'' an exultant Mayor Art Agnos told a
hastily called news conference. He said he hoped there is enough
state and federal money available to replace the Embarcadero
Freeway with a surface or sub-surface artery. It connects Chinatown
and North Beach with the Bay Bridge, which leads to Oakland.
   Chinatown merchants occasionally hooted at supervisors' speeches
that favored tearing down the freeway.
   The mayor said he didn't want the elevated freeway to be knocked
down until it is known there will be enough money to build a
replacement partly on the surface and partly underground. The
resolution passed Monday says virtually the same thing.
   The cost for the road Agnos favors is estimated at $135 million.
   The mayor labeled the freeway ``a terrible blight on the face of
our city for the last 35 years.''
   The board's 6-5 vote, which came after 4{ hours of speechmaking,
was characterized as a signal to the California Department of
Transportation and the federal government that San Francisco has
finally made up its civic mind.
   The board has been accused of repeatedly delaying the decision
for political reasons.

   The manual on your fancy new home
entertainment system says to ``access the next highest programmed
station setting'' on the TV, but warns ``the audio could be muted''
with improper handling.
   If you didn't understand the instructions to change the channel,
and press the right button or risk losing sound, welcome to the
growing ranks of ``techno-dolts.''
   Millions of Americans have trouble doing things like setting VCR
clocks or taping television programs; they are thoroughly confused
by many home electronics instruction books written in
engineer-speak and cluttered with graphics, says Karen Schriver, an
English professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
   Ms. Schriver was recruited by Mitsubishi Electronics America
Inc. to rewrite its manuals so the average consumer can understand.
   Over the past two years she has made hundreds of revisions.
Technical references and abbreviations were zapped and complicated
drawings cleared up.
   The beefier manuals were published on glossy paper with
``warning'' boxes, lots of white space, colored lines and detailed
indexes. The older manuals were flimsy, crowded and dull.
   The new manuals were packaged with this year's Mitsubishi
television sets and stereo gear. New books will accompany 1991's
videocassette recorders, video cameras and laser-disk players, the
company said.
   Mitsubishi is among a slowly growing number of Japanese
companies trying to improve communications with customers.
   Sansui USA Inc., for example, claims its new VCR on-screen
programming can be used by 5-year-olds and ``will make you a
technical wizard in no time.''
   But Japanese companies are ``still in a period of learning
what's expected of a manual in the United States,'' said John Hatch
of the American Electronics Association in Santa Clara, Calif.
   Ms. Schriver says consumers ultimately are being cheated by all
the technical language and drawings that ``look like spiders'' in
many current electronics manuals.
   ``We're buying a VCR that costs more because it has neat
features, but in the end we use three buttons - play, record and
rewind,'' she said. ``Meanwhile, the engineers are doing all these
things with new functions, but can't get their customers to do
them.''
   At Carnegie Mellon's Communications Design Laboratory, students
interviewed 50 people trying to use Mitsubishi products and noted
their stumbling blocks with the old instructions.
   There were several in this 65-word mouthful on how to record
from one VCR to another:
   ``The M-AV1 and M-AV2 incorporates S-VHS inputs for S-VHS VCRs
and an S monitor output for connection to an S compatible TV. When
two S-VHS VCRs are connected to the receiver with S cables, it is
not possible to dub from one to the other through the receiver.
When S-VHS to S-VHS dubbing using S-VIDEO cables is desired,
connect the VCRs directly to one another.''
   With the lab's help, it became: ``You cannot record from one
Super VHS VCR to another through the receiver when you use S-Video
cables. To do this, you must connect the VCRs directly to each
other.''
   The changes are making Mitsubishi an industry leader in showing
customers how to use products, said Ms. Schriver. She said several
Japanese electronics companies inquired about applications of her
research on their products.
   Ms. Schriver said the writers of manuals often have been
entry-level engineers who typically dwelled on the equipment's new
capabilities and forgot about ``the poor consumer who still wants
to know about setting the clock.'' Stand-up comics across the
country often target VCR owners whose machines forever are blinking
``12:00 Sunday'' because they can't set the day and time.
   Recent guests on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' tried unsuccessfully
for 30 minutes to program VCRs for taping.
   Charlene Guyer, a self-proclaimed ``techno-dolt'' and guest on
the ``Oprah'' show, says she's confused by booklets for answering
machines, cameras, VCRs and stereo components from several
companies. She says she has owned a Panasonic VCR for four years
but never taped a program.
   ``Part of my personality is impulsive. If I can't do it quickly,
I don't want to do it,'' said Ms. Guyer, a Philadelphia marketing
consultant. ``You figure you're going to devote a lifetime just to
turn the thing on. So you become frustrated, and end up calling in
your neighbor's kid and paying him 25 cents to do it.''
   Even at Carnegie Mellon, an institution known for computer
science and engineering, students regularly go to Ms. Schriver's
lab to plead for help hooking up electronic gear.
   Assisting such people is serious business, said Christopher
Freeble, a Mitsubishi communications design specialist and former
student of Ms. Schriver's.
   ``We want to look at the product the same way the consumer looks
at it,'' Freeble said from the company's headquarters in Cypress,
Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles.
   Freeble said Mitsubishi is losing money on the new expensive
manuals because their costs aren't passed on, but ``the money is
well spent.''
   ``We feel in the end, we'll buy greater consumer loyalty,'' he
said.

   Here are some of the changes made in Mitsubishi Electronics
America Inc.'s manuals for television sets and videocassette
recorders with the help of Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh:
   -Before: ``To access the next highest programmed station
setting, or to switch to a lower programmed station, the Scan
buttons must be repeatedly pressed.'' After: ``To change channels
press the Scan buttons on the remote control.''
   -Before: ``The audio output will be muted.'' After: ``You won't
hear any sound.''
   -Before: ``This VCR employs direct function switching where any
playback mode may be directly entered from any other playback mode
(normal playback, still frame, speed search, etc.) simply by
pressing the appropriate buttons.'' After: ``When you use a feature
(like Play or Rewind), you can go directly to another feature (like
speed search) without first pressing Stop.''
   -Before: ``This VCR incorporates an elapsed time counter which
shows tape run time in hours, minutes and seconds. Since the
counter works by detecting a control signal, accurate time display
will be maintained even through fast forward or rewind
operations.'' After: ``The time counter shows how long the tape has
run (in hours, minutes and seconds). The time counter is accurate
even when you rewind or fast-forward the tape.''

<HEAD>Some Doctors Ask: Are Physicians Too Greedy?</HEAD>

   One doctor stopped eating in his hospital's dining
room when he finally tired of hearing other physicians brag about
their fat incomes, megabuck retirement funds and money, money,
money.
   Another remembers a colleague's shock at learning her salary.
How could she be happy when her pay - more than comfortable by most
Americans' standards - seemed so low?
   Money, it seems, is becoming an obsession for many in medicine.
Doctors long have made lucrative livings. But huge fees -
especially for surgery and high-tech procedures - have turned
medical pay into a subject of intense fascination, both for those
who pull down sky-high incomes and those who are jealous of the
doctors who do.
   ``Greediness is becoming more and more an issue,'' said Dr.
Michael V. Buenaflor of Northampton, Penn. ``Guys are a lot more
cynical and are turning to the American way of `Go for it.' ''
   But in the medical world, at least, money does not always buy
happiness. Many doctors say they are fed up with their profession.
They complain of second-guessing insurance companies, burdensome
paperwork, miserly Medicare fees, high malpractice rates and the
constant fear of being sued, among other things.
   Some argue that practicing medicine has become so unsatisfying
that many are bent on making sure the work is financially
rewarding, even if it's no longer fun.
   And rewarding it is. The latest statistics show that monetarily,
at least, doctors are doing very well indeed. Their pay is going up
far faster than almost everyone else's: Last year, according to a
survey, their net income rose 12.5 percent, almost triple the rate
of inflation.
   The survey, conducted among 6,484 doctors by the magazine
Medical Economics, found that the median net income of all U.S.
doctors rose almost $15,000 in 1989 to $133,000.
   Among other figures from the survey:
   - Annual incomes ranged from $87,000 for general practitioners
to $296,000 for cardiovascular surgeons.
   - One in five cardiovascular surgeons makes more than $600,000
annually.
   - The typical obstetrician's pay soared $36,000 last year, more
than any other specialty.
   - Only 6 percent of doctors make less than $50,000 a year.
   Many doctors contend they studied hard and put in long hours.
They deserve to make a good living, they say.
   ``When you consider that we work a 60-some hour week, that we
put 12 years of training in and we owe 50 grand when we start on
average, I don't think anybody is robbing the bank,'' said Dr.
Philip R. Alper, an internist in Burlingame, Calif.
   ``We don't make an excessive wage,'' he said. ``I don't have an
apology to make.''
   Some, in fact, fear they are falling behind.
   ``Nobody feels bad for physicians. We do make a good living,''
said Dr. Craig Czarsty, a family practitioner and doctor's son in
Oakville, Conn. ``But is my earning power the same as my father's
was 20 years ago? Probably not.''
   Specialists are particularly well off, but they contend they
deserve to make more than other people, including doctors in
general care. Their work is often tedious and exacting, they say,
and requires technical skills that take many years to perfect.
   Dr. Thomas Purdon of the University of Arizona Health Science
Center notes the special pressures faced by his colleagues in
obstetrics and gynecology, whose earnings the magazine survey pegs
at $194,000.
   Besides the many hours seeing women through their pregnancies,
labor and early motherhood, there is a real possibility that each
is a potential courtroom opponent.
   ``The public expects an absolutely perfect product and doesn't
want to recognize that there can be genetic problems and other
things that the obstetrician has no control over,'' said Purdon.
   ``If things don't turn out just A-OK, the first thing they do is
try to find a lawyer to sue him.''
   Yet an undercurrent of feeling remains - both inside and outside
the profession - that some doctors are just plain money hungry. A
survey conducted last year for the American Medical Association
found that two-thirds of Americans think doctors are too interested
in making money.
   Some of the criticism even comes from the well-paid specialties.
Dr. Peter S. Czachor of Kittery, Maine, notes that when he retired
five years ago, he was charging $700 for complete obstetrical care.
Now doctors in his area are charging $2,000 for the same thing, and
their malpractice rates are the same.
   Those complaining loudest about physician avarice often are
doctors in the lower-paying primary care specialties.
   Buenaflor is the doctor who grew weary of dining room talk of
physicians' financial conquests. The final straw for him was an
ear, nose and throat specialist who said he'd finished the year
with an extra $160,000 that he couldn't figure out how to spend.
   Buenaflor is a family practitioner, traditionally the
lowest-paid medical specialty. (Last year, according to the
magazine survey, they netted an average $97,000.)
   Often, when these doctors on the front lines of medical care
talk about money, the conversation turns to specialists in more
technical fields.
   ``I'm going to be in my office 12 hours today,'' Buenaflor said.
``I will net less than a colorectal guy across town will do for a
20-minute colonoscopy,'' a routine diagnostic procedure.
   Dr. Lorilee Smith, a rheumatologist in Modesto, Calif., said she
believes the financial attitudes of many young doctors who set up
practice in the 1980s simply reflect the decade's fixation on
money. She was struck by a conversation with a young dermatologist
who moved into her building.
   ``After she had been here for a while, I told her what I made.
She was shocked. She said, `But you seem so happy.' Compared to
dermatologists, I'm making poverty-level wages, even though I make
great money,'' Smith said.
   Insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors
spend figuring out which of these treatments their patients need.
But that will change, at least a little.
   Beginning in 1992, Medicare will reimburse doctors more for
their time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical
services and operations. Private insurance companies are expected
to make similar changes.
   This will raise the pay for family doctors and lower it for many
surgeons and radiologists. While the changes will narrow the
spread, it certainly will not eliminate it. Doctors who deliver
babies will still make considerably more than, say, the
pediatricians who care for them later. Is the pay of such
specialists as obstetricians fair?
   ``What's fair payment?'' asks Dr. John Graham, an official of
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   He offers a sports analogy to bolster his point:``Is Joe Montana
worth what he gets? I don't know.''

   Yo-yo dieting - repeatedly losing and regaining weight - may be
more dangerous to the cardiovascular system than remaining somewhat
overweight, and may even promote weight gain, researchers say.
   Long-term dieters also need to become educated about nutrition.
For example, while the typical American diet includes about 40
percent of its calories from fat, many experts recommend 20 percent
to 30 percent.
   ``They really have very little idea what a portion size means in
terms of cutting it,'' Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the Obesity
Research Center at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, said
in a recent speech. ``They have very little idea of how much fat is
in a food they eat or how much sugar there is in a food they eat.''
   Liederman knows his nutrition, exercises daily and appears to
have motivation in abundance. But will he keep his weight off?
   ``I could regress. I could find some rationale I can't
foresee,'' Liederman said. ``I could still fall off the wagon.''
   Frightening, to a dieter.
   By World War I, when this country had its first best-selling
diet book, there also was a U.S. Food Administration. Herbert
Hoover, as its head, called on the nation to eat less.
   ``Fatness was careless, selfish, wasteful, treacherous and
un-American,'' Schwartz wrote. ``There was to the culture of
slimming between 1930 and 1960 an element of fear that the more one
had, the emptier one would be.''
   In 1952, the director of the National Institutes of Health
declared obesity the primary national health problem. In 1960, a
fitness enthusiast called Jack LaLanne had the largest national
daytime television show audience. And before the decade was out, a
skinny model called Twiggy became an idol.
   Obesity today is considered a major health problem, associated
with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, joint problems
and other diseases. Much, however, remains unknown.
   ``We don't yet understand how most heavy people get to be
heavy,'' Brownell said.
   Genetics, metabolism, culture, psychology and other things all
play a role, but their relative importance is not fully understood,
although some people are heavy simply because they eat too much and
exercise too little. Many fat people, however, eat no more than
thin people. Their bodies seem to use calories less efficiently.
   Maintaining weight loss seems harder than losing it. Estimates
of the recidivism rate commonly top 90 percent, though Brownell
suspects that is too high, especially for hospital-based
comprehensive programs.
   These are odds to attract only the foolhardiest bettor, but in
dieters hope springs eternal.
   David Liederman faces his obsession his way, every day. There's
his theater district restaurant, the Broadway Cafe; his East Side
French restaurant, Chez Louis; and David's Cookies, little takeout
shops where the huge chunks of chocolate ooze out of the dough.
   ``When I was over 300 pounds, I convinced myself I had to taste
each batch of cookies - this one might be different than that
one,'' Liederman said.
   Until his doctor told him he might not live to see his daughters
grow up.
   Neither of his young daughters is overweight, but he is
vigilant.
   ``It scares me because I know what it did to me,'' he said. ``If
I didn't have this problem, I'd be a lot more productive.''

   From the great cities to the small towns,
America's municipalities are telling the federal government they
can't possibly be as small as census takers say.
   By the thousands, local officials are demanding something be
done about the 1990 Census. Even states are contesting the
preliminary figures, aware that the more residents they are
credited with, the more federal aid they will get and the greater
their representation in Congress will be.
   Some voices from the nationwide chorus:
   -``Unadulterated nonsense ... statistical grand larceny,'' said
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
   -``There are errors everywhere,'' said Detroit research director
Juliette Okotie-Eboh.
   -``It really stretches credibility to the breaking point,'' said
Hartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry.
   -``They missed our farthest south street,'' said Hays, Iowa,
City Clerk Judy Grothe.
   All were reacting to the preliminary results of the Census
Bureau's April 15 head count.
   The preliminary reports were sent out in late August and early
this month to give officials a chance to file challenges in time
for the bureau to double-check its numbers before announcing its
final count Dec. 31.
   Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant has already told Congress
there will be big changes in the initial numbers.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' she said.
   Even some states that posted gains in the preliminary figures
are upset.
   Take Texas. Despite recording significantly more people, state
officials say the count is not high enough.
   ``Our conservative estimate puts the state's population at about
17 million. If the census' final count ... stays with 16.8 million,
Texas will definitely be shortchanged,'' state Comptroller Bob
Bullock said.
   But it is clearly from the jurisdictions that showed losses that
the loudest complaints are coming.
   Such as West Virginia, credited with the largest population drop
of any state.
   ``Many West Virginians live up dirt roads and hollows, and
proving their existence has been as difficult as it has been for
the Census Bureau to find them,'' said Bob Brunner, spokesman for
Gov. Gaston Caperton.
   Or Pennsylvania, where Vincent Carocci, spokesman for
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey, said the preliminary count
underestimated the population by 200,000 to 300,000. Census takers
undercounted the state's cities, Carocci said, because people there
are ``just harder to count.''
   Or tiny Jacksonburg, Ohio, which the Census Bureau said has 14
residents. Last week, 39 Jacksonburg residents appeared at a
protest of the count. Between them, they said they could count at
least 26 more people in the town.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena was ``stunned.'' New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo exclaimed, ``I don't believe it.'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson said if errors aren't corrected, ``we'll see them in
court.''
   Barraged with such complaints, the Census Bureau is having
workers do rechecks of some neighborhoods, add late reports and
factor in military personnel overseas.
   The bureau has its hands full.
   In Iowa, officials say as many as 75,000 residents were missed.
   In Louisiana, said a representative of Avoyelles Parish, ``We
know for sure that's not right. Several types of errors were made
but I don't know what kind. ``Something went wrong, but I guarantee
that we will get to the bottom of this.''
   Why are the numbers so important?
   Simple. After the nation's population is counted every 10 years,
the House of Representatives is reapportioned and federal and state
aid formulas are adjusted. Losing people, or not growing as fast as
other places, can mean a loss of political power and federal aid
until the next census.
   The census news wasn't bad everywhere, though.
   Seattle and Washington state officials are pleased with the
preliminary counts, which exceeded their own estimates.
   ``We still think there are people out there that the census did
not count, but generally we think they did a pretty good job,''
said urban research analyst Eric Friedli.
   ``My impression is that we have a smaller proportion of people
who aren't going to respond or who aren't going to be counted. I
don't see any outstanding reason to say this is a bad census,''
said Lawrence Weisser, a state research investigator.
   Officials in Sacramento, Calif., are puzzled by preliminary
census figures 5 percent higher than they had estimated. ``I'm at a
loss,'' said Scott Mende, a city planner.

   Ali Hussain goes to school by
candlelight. He works all day punching holes in tin for toy
harmonicas, and daylight has faded before he gets to his books.
Electricity is in short supply.
   So are schools. Until six years ago Tikea Para, one of the
poorest areas in a city notorious for its slums, had no elementary
school.
   The predominantly Moslem residents took matters into their own
hands, chipping in manpower and a few rupees. Today, 400 children
go to a one-room school built, run and taught by people from the
neighborhood.
   Another 80 child laborers go to night class, not always winning
the struggle to stay awake. Ali, 8, says he earns $1.84 a week.
   ``This is a very backward area. These are poor people, and there
are too many child workers,'' said Sekander Khan, secretary of the
residents' committee.
   ``We can't stop child labor,'' Khan said. ``If we can't give
them an education, they will be like this all their lives.''
   The residents of Tikea Para have gone farther than most to
collectively help themselves in a city incapable of coping with its
population explosion.
   In the last 50 years, waves of migrants from Bangladesh and from
Indian villages have swollen Calcutta's population to 12 million.
An estimated 43 percent live in slums, or ``bustees.'' Uncounted
thousands camp on the street.
   Tikea Para is a bustee of about 100,000 people in Howrah, a
municipality across the Hooghly River fro Calcutta's business
district.
   The slum dwellers were galvanized into community action when a
woman in the neighborhood was raped by a gang of hoodlums running
an illegal liquor store, Khan said. With police help, they cleaned
out the area, fenced off their bustee and took a hard look at their
children's future.
   The school began in 1984 with 20 children sitting on the dirt in
the neighborhood courtyard. They applied for municipal help but
were told other education projects had higher priority, Khan said.
   Now kids in tidy uniforms attend classes taught by young
unemployed university graduates from the neighborhood. They sit on
wooden benches, jostling papers on their laps because they have no
desks.
   The school operates two daytime shifts, with two grades sitting
in the same room each shift. A row of sewing machines occupies the
back.
   The courtyard has been taken over by a homemade merry-go-round
with wooden horses.
   Twice weekly a volunteer doctor from a nearby German-sponsored
clinic visits the bustee, receiving patients in a tiny back room of
the school.
   Tikea Para has about 70 small factories worked mostly by
children as young as 5. The most recent estimates say India had
16.6 million child laborers in 1986.
   The bustees of Calcutta and Howrah mark the decline of a
once-great city. Some call it the lowest form of urban life.
   Until 1912, Calcutta was the capital of India, the ``Second
City'' of the British empire after London. Its gracious Gothic
buildings, green lawns, wide boulevards and exclusive clubs
provided the backdrop for a lifestyle that symbolized the peak of
the colonial age.
   The Victorian-style buildings are eroding under an assault of
grime and neglect. Shantytowns have sprung up in the open spaces of
well-to-do areas.
   Howrah is a warren of cell-like shacks separated by open sewers.
But inside the shacks, the stone floors are spotlessly clean.
Residents bathe openly - partially dressed - under water pumps,
which kids usually turn into a game.
   Hunger is rife. Rag-draped people can be seen picking through
mounds of garbage for scraps of food, competing with mangy dogs,
crows and cattle.
   It was here that Mother Teresa, a frail Roman Catholic nun,
became known as ``the saint of the gutters'' for giving dying
homeless people a bed, succor and dignity in their last hours.
   But the 800,000 people of Howrah show a surprising resilience
and acceptance in the face of crushing poverty and hunger.
   ``People are not unhappy here, especially the children,'' said
Helgo Meyer-Hamme, a West German doctor on a six-week volunteer
stint in the clinic.
   ``In Germany people are rich, live in nice houses and have
plenty to eat, but they are not happy. Here the children laugh all
the time. They can play with anything. Even a little piece of paper
can be a toy. We can learn from these people,'' said Meyer-Hamme.
   The doctors say most of their patients suffer from hunger- and
hygiene-related diseases: worms, tuberculosis, skin diseases and
respiratory illness. Leprosy is common.
   ``These people have nothing to look forward to,'' concluded
Meyer-Hamme's colleague, Bettina Borgmann. ``But the people
surprised me. Most seem quite happy.''

   Democrat John Silber's unexpected victory in the
Massachusetts gubernatorial primary is renewing questions about
whether voters lie to pollsters.
   The same questions followed the careers of Barry Goldwater and
George Wallace, whose support was understated in some polls.
   Silber, on leave as president of Boston University, defeated
former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti by a comfortable
9-point margin, winning 53 percent of the vote in Tuesday's
Democratic primary.
   Polls published just before the election showed Bellotti ahead
and ``surging.'' One poll gave Bellotti a lead of 50 percent to 39
percent. An election-eve survey showed Bellotti leading 49 percent
to 35 percent.
   Gerry Chervinsky, whose polls at KRC Communications Research in
Cambridge showed Bellotti in the lead close to the primary,
believes some poll respondents hid their support for Silber.
   They liked Silber's combative style and confrontational
rhetoric, but weren't willing to admit it, he believes.
   ``I don't think there's any question at all that voters were not
forthcoming about voting for Silber,'' Chervinsky said. ``It was
socially unacceptable to say, it was impolite to say, `I'm voting
for Silber.'''
   Other factors also contributed to the polling problem, such as
the difficulties of predicting turnout in a primary and of
determining whether independent voters will take a Democratic or
Republican ballot, Chervinsky said.
   But Silber, in a television interview Sunday, said his and
election results elsewhere in the nation reflected a growing
``anti-media sentiment.''
   On ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' program he said he
believed one of the polls was ``slanted in the sample that it
took.''
   Silber had warned weeks before the primary that some pollsters
would be ``looking for work'' after Sept. 18 because they were
missing his supporters. He speculated that his backers viewed
questions from pollsters as ``an invasion of privacy.''
   The polls were off only in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.
Other Massachusetts races, some of them close and volatile, were
predicted accurately.
   Exit polls indicated as many as 20 percent of the voters made up
their minds in the last days of the campaign and went
overwhelmingly for Silber. But Chervinsky said voters who concealed
their support for Silber could have skewed polls by as much as 10
points.
   Experts differ on whether voters willfully mislead pollsters.
   ``If I believed that people lied in the telephone interview
process I'd have to get out of the polling business and get a
broom,'' said John Becker of the Sudbury-based Becker Isstitute
Inc., which conducted some early polls. ``It's all speculation. No
one ever produces any evidence that people lie.''
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato says
lying ``is more of a pollster's excuse than a reality.''
   Any voter fibbing that does take place probably is canceled out
by fibbing in the opposite direction, he said.
   But the Gallup Organization, a nationwide polling firm in
Princeton, N.J. has developed evidence from past elections that
voters may mislead pollsters about particular candidates or
situations.
   Paul Perry, who was president of Gallup from 1959 to 1976, said
studies conducted during Sen. Barry Goldwater's campaign for
president in 1964 showed some voters were reluctant to admit they
supported Goldwater.
   Polling conducted by secret ballot showed greater support for
Goldwater than that revealed by traditional face-to-face or
telephone polling.
   Even more marked disparities turned up when George Wallace ran a
third-party campaign for president in 1968. Studies showed that a
larger number of voters supported the segregationist Alabamian than
were willing to admit to pollsters.
   Silber, while no clone of Goldwater or Wallace, is similar in
his flinty, brusque, straight-talking style. He says things that
some people find offensive and that may have led voters to conceal
their support for him.
   ``There may be some people with hidden preferences,'' said
Perry. As to whether it amounts to lying, ``I guess you'd have to
say that's what they're doing.''
   In any event, the difference between what voters may tell
pollsters and how they actually vote is never more than 10 percent,
Perry said.
   Sabato said the lesson of the Massachusetts Democratic primary
is simple: ``Let's pay a great deal less attention to polling. ...
You cannot precisely predict what human beings are going to do.''

<HEAD>Firing of Police Chief Brings City's Festering Racial Woes to
Forefront</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black county commissioner's threat that a
violent street war would erupt if the city hires a ``good old boy''
police chief exposed festering racial tensions that some say
threaten to tear this city apart.
   ``The problem in Dallas is not the minority community and the
Dallas Police Department,'' said Pettis Norman, a former Dallas
Cowboys football star who is now a successful local businessman.
``The problem is the institutionalized racism we have in Dallas.''
   As the talk turned last week to who would replace the ousted
Mack Vines as police chief, minority activist and County
Commissioner John Wiley Price issued a call to arms. He warned that
Vines, a white whose policies were praised by minority leaders, had
better not be replaced by a ``good old boy'' - a traditional
Southern white.
   If that happened, Price said, a violent street war would follow
in which he and others would shoot at police and ``take this whole
city.''
   Although shocking, Price's words were only the latest of several
indicators that all is far from well in this city of nearly 1
million residents, of which about a third are black:
   -The southern suburbs are threatening to secede amid reports
that more tax money is spent in affluent, mostly white North
Dallas.
   -In December, residents go to the polls to vote on a referendum
that would eliminate at-large City Council districts, which a judge
ruled dilute minority voting strength.
   -Last month, a Dallas Times Herald survey of 1988 sentencing
revealed killers and rapists whose victims were white received
harsher punishment than those whose victims were black or Hispanic.
   -A Dallas Morning News survey in 1988 reported that 44 percent
of the city's black population and 44 percent of its white
population agree race relations have deteriorated within the past
five years.
   ``Change must take place now that lessens racial polarization
and bridges the gaps between our people,'' a task force called
Dallas Together concluded last year. The force was formed after a
record number of police shootings of citizens, most of them black
or Hispanic, in 1988.
   Norman said the racism extends beyond the police department and
includes churches that don't denouce racism and a business
community that makes it hard for black business people to get
loans.
   But the police department has been a focal point of minority
concerns. Vines, who is white, was hired as chief two years ago to
help address the situation.
   He won praise from Price and other minority leaders for an
aggressive affirmative action policy and sensitivity to minorities,
but rankled some members of his department.
   He was fired Sept. 12, hours after his indictment on a
misdemeanor perjury charge.
   Vines pleaded innocent to the charge of lying to a special panel
investigating the firing of police officer Patrick LeMaire. He
fired LeMaire in June 1989 after the officer shot and killed an
unarmed Mexican.
   LeMaire, who said he thought the man was reaching for a weapon,
was reinstated by a review board, but decided not to return to the
force.
   Six days after Vines' firing, Price gave the city his ``good old
boy'' ultimatum.
   People on both sides of the issue blasted the remarks, and Price
backed off somewhat. ``I probably shouldn't have said it,'' he said
later.
   ``It's so obvious what my comment would be, I'm not going to
comment,'' said Mayor Annette Strauss.
   ``Violence is wrong too,'' said Peter Johnson, regional director
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's southwestern
office, based in Dallas. ``We have to move beyond that.''
   Norman said he told Price his remarks were ludicrous.
   But he added that the frustrations of racism remain.
   ``Every couple of years we incorrectly redefine the problem and
try to correct it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Workers Back from Kuwait Find Few Jobs, Little Hope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AL-WIHDAT, Jordan (AP) - In this dusty Palestinian refugee camp,
a soft-spoken victim of the invasion of Kuwait calculated the hefty
losses in his young life with a shrug and prayer for peace.
   Isam Al-Absi is 24, homeless, stateless and, quite suddenly,
poor.
   In the fallout of the Aug. 2 invasion, he is among the faceless
numbers forced to survive on their wits, without recourse to
government aid.
   While world attention has focused on the military standoff in
the Persian Gulf and the plight of Asian refugees in desert camps,
tens of thousands of Jordanians and Palestinians have returned from
Kuwait to find jobs scarce and hope waning.
   ``In Kuwait we were stable,'' said Al-Absi. ``We were set up in
our jobs. We had good careers, cars, homes. Everything was complete
for us. And now, we don't have a home, we don't have careers, we
don't have cars.''
   The young civil engineer, whose family fled Palestine to Jordan
in 1948, said he left Kuwait on Tuesday, reached Jordan the next
day, and hopes eventually to join his family in Cairo, Egypt. They
were vacationing there when Iraq attacked Kuwait.
   Authorities in Amman estimate that half the 120,000 Jordanians
working in Kuwait and an unknown number of Palestinians are
returning to Jordan, which is itself facing economic catastrophe
from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Finance Minister Basel Jardaneh said Jordan is considering what
it can do to help. But for now it has no aid program.
   Government officials are worried about how to absorb such huge
numbers in a country where unemployment is already officially
estimated at 15 percent and where the economy is teetering on the
brink of collapse.
   ``Nobody can find a job here,'' Mohammed Sabti said glumly as
stood before his family's cement-block house on a rocky hillside in
the small town of Awagan.
   The 22-year-old Jordanian said he lost his job selling used cars
in Kuwait because all the cars were stolen from the dealership
after the invasion.
   Sabti, who holds a university degree in hotel management, said
he has failed to find a job in Jordan and plans to return to
occupied Kuwait in two weeks to look for work.
   ``If I could find a job here that would pay a salary of even 100
Jordanian dinars (about $160) a month, I'd stay,'' he said.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. secretary-general's special
envoy for humanitarian assistance in the gulf crisis, said last
week that the Palestinian and Jordanian workers, along with
thousands of Asian refugees, have to be considered victims of the
crisis.
   ``For all these people, it's a broken dream. All of them tell
the same story. They became destitute overnight,'' he said.
   Al-Absi said he and other foreign workers in Kuwait blame Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for their losses. He said they don't
support Saddam's demand that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait be
tied to a solution of the Palestinian problem.
   ``Here in Jordan and the other Arab places, they don't see the
problem as we see it,'' he said.
   ``Those who lived in Kuwait for 10 years - or even three or four
years - are against the invasion because of the suffering it has
caused,'' he added.
   ``We want to get Palestine back. But I don't think this is the
way to do it. ... The way to Palestine is not through Kuwait.''
   He said the Palestinian support inside Kuwait for the Iraqi
occupation came from those who arrived after the invasion and who
are ``gaining benefits from the invasion.''
   Ousted Kuwaiti officials say Saddam is trying to expel Kuwaitis.
They say he is attempting to repopulate Kuwait with Iraqis and
Iraq's supporters.
   ``I don't think anyone who stands on the side of truth is in
favor of the invasion. But we're also against any harm to Iraq. We
want this to end peacefully,'' Al-Absi said.

   Israel has won friends and outmaneuvered some
enemies during the Persian Gulf crisis, but many fear the country
may face long-term political losses in a rapidly changing Middle
East.
   Senior officials in the right-wing government of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said that despite Iraqi threats to attack Israel,
the country appears better off today than it did two months ago.
   ``Today, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, but we don't
know what will be in the future,'' said Yossi Olmert, head of the
Government Press Office.
   Among the short-term benefits to Israel:
   -The Americans, busy in the gulf, have eased pressure on Israel
to settle its conflict with the Palestinians.
   -Israel's two worst enemies, Iraq and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, have discredited themselves in the eyes of the West.
   -In view of Iraqi threats, the Americans are expected to be
responsive to Israeli demands for more military aid.
   -The crisis has accelerated rapprochement between Israel and the
Soviet Union. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Israeli
Cabinet ministers this month for the first time.
   At the same time, Israel is concerned about huge U.S. arms sales
to pro-Western Arab states. Israel fears these weapons will tip the
strategic balance in the Middle East in favor of the Arabs.
   ``They (Arab countries) never use these weapons for their
defense, and if they ever use them, we are afraid they will be used
against us,'' Shamir warned after the Americans proposed selling up
to $21 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.
   Some Israeli analysts say the arms deals are a sign that a new
doctrine is taking hold in Washington under which Saudi Arabia may
outweigh Israel as a U.S. ally in the Middle East.
   ``One of the main dangers for Israel is a deterioration in its
status in the eyes of the United States,'' wrote Yaakov Goldberg, a
researcher at Tel Aviv University's Dayan Institute for Middle East
Research.
   ``Israel's rivals are already busy drafting a new sketch whereby
Israel would no longer be an American strategic asset because the
Soviet threat ... has disappeared and because Israel has no part in
inter-Arab disputes,'' he wrote in the daily Haaretz.
   Olmert, the government press official, played down such
concerns. ``It's inevitable that the Saudis will be No. 1 on the
list of American priorities for a while. (But) that hasn't changed
the nature of U.S.-Israeli relations.''
   Other analysts say that once the gulf crisis is settled, there
may be momentum to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   With the Americans and the Soviets on the same side of the
fence, it might be difficult for Israel to withstand the pressure
to make a deal, including giving up the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Already, the Americans reportedly have warned Israel to show
some flexibility on U.S. compromise peace proposals once the gulf
conflict is resolved.
   Gerald Steinberg, a Middle East historian at Tel Aviv's Bar Ilan
University, said he expected ``more pressure on Israel to make
concessions'' once the gulf crisis is resolved.
   International support for a Palestinian state, however, is
dwindling, Steinberg said. ``It's likely that a Palestinian state
would become a mini-Iraq, and therefore no Western country would
support such a state,'' he said.
   Israel's most imminent concern is that Americans would settle
for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and leave the gulf without
having destroyed Saddam Hussein's war machine.
   The Israelis argue that in such a case, Israel would be left
alone to deal with a stronger and more dangerous Iraq.
   Israel has tried to get that message across, while trying not to
look like a warmonger.
   Olmert spelled out Israel's double message: ``We don't incite
the Americans to do this or that, but aggressive elements in the
Middle East should be punished enough so they are not able to
repeat their aggression.''
   Some analysts are quick to point out that the Israelis are not
the only ones pushing for a U.S. attack against Iraq.
   ``The Egyptians and the Saudis are pressing even harder than
Israel for military action,'' said Mark Heller, an analyst at Tel
Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   Amid the various scenarios on how the gulf crisis will end, only
one thing seems certain: it will dramatically transform the Middle
East.
   Syria, once Israel's most implacable foe, is edging toward the
West, and there is speculation it might talk peace with Israel.
Jordan, once considered Israel's silent partner, is moving deeper
into the Iraqi sphere.
   ``We will have a new order in the Middle East,'' Steinberg said.

   East German inmates demanding an amnesty
linked to German unity have occupied roofs and held hunger strikes
in about 20 jails and detention centers, the East German news
agency ADN reported.
   The protests began last week and widened over the weekend after
acting East German Justice Minister Manfred Walther, in a
television interview, ruled out a ``jubilee'' amnesty in
conjunctionwith German unity on Oct. 3.
   Seven prisoners occupying the roof of the Brandenburg prison,
which is 30 miles west of Berlin, threatened to jump off if their
demands were not met.
   Inmates at a jail in Frankfurt an der Oder, a city on the Polish
border, demolished rooms, broke glass and threw burning objects out
the window after Walther's remarks.
   The inmates want the East German parliament to approve an
amnesty before unification, when it will be dissolved.

   A Japanese Cabinet minister's offhand suggestion
that American blacks ruin white neighborhoods reflects the deep
prejudices and provincialism that still hinder Japan's much-touted
internationalism, analysts say.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's public comments Friday, in
which he compared blacks to prostitutes, were the latest to
aggravate relations between Japanese politicians and U.S.
minorities. Blacks also have heard themselves belittled in recent
years as illiterate and financially irresponsible.
   Each incident has drawn howls of U.S. protest. Yet such comments
keep cropping up because Japan, for all its export savvy and love
of Western goods, remains in many ways as isolated from Western
thinking as it has for most of its long history, observers say.
   ``Japan is a society of fundamental discrimination against other
ethnic and racial groups,'' said Patricia Steinhoff, former head of
the University of Hawaii's Center for Japanese Studies.
   ``Japanese politicians used to be able to get away with this
kind of thing, but now all of a sudden they can't'' because of
adverse publicity, she said. ``I don't really think they know where
to draw the line.''
   At a news conference following a police roundup of foreign
prostitutes in Tokyo, Kajiyama coomented Friday that such
prostitutes ``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods when they
arrive.
   ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because
blacks move in, and whites are forced out,'' said the newly
appointed minister, who previously held two other key Cabinet
posts, including head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
   Shortly afterward, the Justice Ministry issued a statement from
Kajiyama, who said he meant to convey that people living in that
district of Tokyo feel insecure.
   It said the 64-year-old minister's comments contained
``expressions that may cause misunderstanding.'' But it did not
offer an explicit apology.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights in Washington, called Kajiyama's comments
``reprehensible and racist.''
   Japanese analysts say racism here often reflects the nation's
pride in its own supposed racial purity. In 1985, for example, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a report attributing Japan's
economic successes to its racial homogeneity.
   ``Japanese are continuously being reminded of the uniqueness of
their culture ... by their teachers, newspapers and TV programs,''
Dutch author Karel Van Wolferen wrote in a much-discussed recent
book, ``The Enigma of Japanese Power.''
   Even Japanese who have been partially educated abroad ``are
actively discriminated against and are often the object of teasing
and class bullying'' when they return, Van Wolferen said. ``They
are invariably made to feel they are contaminated.''
   Black athletes and entertainers are popular on Japanese
television, along with others who seem to satisfy an everlasting
hunger here for things Western. And officially, the government
continues its policy of ``internationalization'' - urging companies
to hire more foreigners.
   But in Japanese eyes, foreigners always remain ``gaijin'' -
``outside people.''
   Some Japanese point out that U.S. politicians also occasionally
commit racial gaffes and insult foreign cultures. Indeed, Japan is
a favorite target these days, relentlessly criticized in Washington
both over trade and its level of support for the U.S. stand in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``Do you think that U.S. politicians are so sensitive to world
opinion? Japanese government members can be (seen) at about the
same level as U.S. congressmen,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a Tokyo
University politics professor who served as adviser to former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   The outspoken Nakasone caused a stir himself in 1986 when he
said: ``On the average, the United States is lower because of a
considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.''
   The prime minister said he was referring to literacy rate. He
later apologized and said he realized his comment had ``offended
many Americans.'' But he did not retract his remarks.
   Japanese politicians have landed in hot water for other comments
denigrating women, other Asians and people of other countries.
   More and more, however, they're being forced to curb their
tongues, if only because Japan sends about 40 percent of its
exports to the United States, and many of its consumers are
minorities.
   Ms. Steinhoff, who is now doing research in Tokyo, said that in
the past, the press, often part of the same ``old-boy'' network as
the politicians, simply didn't report such comments.
   The Japanese will ``still say these things about Koreans and any
other group they can find when they see them as politically
powerless,'' she said. ``But they don't realize this is out of
bounds in the media politics'' of the West.

   The people of English, fed up with floods,
are packing up Main Street and moving to higher ground.
   In one of the most ambitious projects of its kind, the town
plans to tear down or move more than 70 homes as well as the
library, the bank, the newspaper and about 30 other businesses.
   A new downtown is planned a mile away on a hillside now covered
by cornfields and trees.
   The town of 650 people in one of the state's poorest counties
hopes to raise $6 million for the move from a half-dozen state and
federal agencies.
   ``The town's made the decision to move and we're going to move.
We don't blink an eye to anyone when we say that,'' said Tony
Pappano, a community developer hired to plan the move.
   Abuut 75 percent of the town will be affected by the move,
Pappano said.
   Five inches of heavy rain to the north can wreak havoc in
English, where three creeks merge to form the Little Blue River.
   Each of the creeks normally is quiet and shallow enough for
children to go wading without getting their knees wet. But the
streams can rise 20 feet in hours when thousands of acres to the
north begin draining toward English.
   Floods have struck occasionally during the town's 150-year
history. The worst on record sent 13 feet of water down Main Street
in 1979.
   It was a flash flood that struck early on the morning of June 7,
forcing evacuation of more than 100 residents, that convinced Town
Council President John Merrilees.
   ``We're going,'' he said. ``There's too much lives and property
at stake not to.''
   Other flood-prone towns have moved. But English is planning one
of the largest such projects in the country, said Bill Powers of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Chicago office.
   The three-member Town Council voted last week to condemn
property in the flood plain that covers the heart of town.
Residents who live there will be forced to sell their homes to the
county.
   The next step is annexation and zoning of about 600 acres to the
northeast, doubling the town's size. The area should be annexed
within two months, Pappano said.
   A FEMA architect and a $44,000 planning grant from the agency
helped English come up with plans for a new downtown. It would be
connected to the buildings left behind by a new road.
   ``We want to keep the entire town together. We don't want an old
town and a new town. It will all be one English,'' Pappano said.
   The town would like to make the flood plain area into a park,
possibly with a golf course and tennis courts, Pappano said.
   All that depends on how much money can be obtained from the
state, FEMA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the
Commerce Department and anyone else willing to help.
   Some elderly residents are apprehensive about the move.
   Temple Real, 82, said he has lived on Camp Fork Creek all his
life and sees no reason to leave now. Three feet of water flooded
his house in 1979, but since then the floods haven't topped the
porch.
   ``When you've lived some place all your life you respect it,''
Real said. ``Someone else maybe doesn't and wants to move away.
That's all right, but they should leave me alone.''
   There has been little opposition to the move because the town
has been dying for years, Pappano said. Empty storefronts pepper
the two blocks of businesses along Main Street, and several homes
are for sale along Fifth Street, the town's other main road.
   ``Crawford County is historically the most economically
depressed county in Indiana and the world is moving without them,''
Pappano said.
   ``Would you want to drop 5 cents in a business in downtown
English?'' he asked. ``After the last flood, the businesses
themselves said, `We're not staying for another one.'''

<HEAD>Decision to Admit Tapes in Court Worries Psychotherapists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court decision allowing audio tapes of
counseling to be used in a murder trial has mental health
professionals worried that the ancient tradition of patient
confidentiality is in danger.
   California courts opened the door to the psychotherapist's
office a bit wider with a decision Aug. 6 allowing tapes of
counseling to be used against brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez in
the slaying of their parents.
   Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot repeatedly at close range in
their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. Six months later, police
arrested Lyle, 21, and Erik, 19, alleging the young men coveted
their parents' $15 million estate.
   Prosecutors argued that tapes of the brothers' counseling
sessions with therapist L. Jerome Oziel, in which they reportedly
confessed to killing their parents, could be used as evidence.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht agreed, saying the tapes
were not covered by laws guarding patint-therapist communication.
   These statutes are an extension of the right of privacy between
doctor and patient that dates to Greek philosopher Hippocrates, the
founder of modern medicine. The Hippocratic oath, still taken by
new physicians, binds doctors to secrecy about their patients'
cases.
   Many psychotherapists say the courts are eroding this vow when
the need to protect society clashes with an individual's right to
privacy.
   ``Confidentiality is the cornerstone of the relationship between
patient and therapist,'' said Win Schachter, an attorney for the
American Psychological Association in Sacramento. ``They (patients)
talk about their most intimate and deepest thoughts. If there is a
hole in that privacy, they will feel less secure and safe.''
   Albracht's Menendez decision was upheld by the state Court of
Appeal and is now before the California Supreme Court, which
ordered the tapes sealed until it decides whether to hear the case.
   In making his decision, Albracht cited a recent state Supreme
Court case, People vs. Clark.
   William John Clark was convicted of injuring his former
therapist and murdering her husband by setting the couple's home on
fire. While in therapy during the trial, Clark told another
psychologist he wanted to kill two other people.
   That therapist warned the two people, following guidelines
established in a 1974 landmark duty-to-warn ruling called the
Tarasoff decision. She later testified about Clark's murderous
desires.
   Clark, sentenced to death, appealed the verdict, arguing that he
had not given his therapist permission to break confidentiality.
   But the Supreme Court ruled the sessions were not privileged
because the therapist had already broken confidentiality by issuing
the warnings, as required under Tarasoff.
   Since the Oziel tapes - as well as transcripts of the secret
hearings on their admissibility - remain sealed, it is not known
for sure what parallels exist between the Clark and Menendez cases.
   Yet a woman who claims to have had a romantic relationship with
Oziel said in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine that the
therapist let her listen to sessions in which the brothers
confessed to the murders.
   Although Oziel has denied he shared the tapes, refusing further
comment, prosecutors say the brothers threatened the therapist.
Under Tarasoff, this would make the counselor's alleged sharing of
the tapes acceptable and therefore admissable in the Menendez case
under Clark.
   ``Once the facts become known,'' Albracht said, ``it will be
fairly clear that this case falls squarely within the statute.''
   Gerald Chaleff, Lyle Menendez's attorney, acknowledged that
threats were made but questioned the judge's decision to allow all
the tapes into evidence. ``What has to be divulged is only what is
necessary to prevent danger,'' he said.
   The APA's Schachter said the Menendez decision could have a
chilling effect on therapy.
   ``The decision might imply that any careless words or placing of
files might inadvertently trigger an opening of what was believed
to have been confidential,'' he said. ``It could be incredibly
damaging.''
   However, Elliott Alhadeff, the prosecutor who argued for the
tapes to be released, said, ``The patient has nothing to worry
about as long as he trusts his psychotherapist.''
   In the 1950s and 1960s, nearly all states passed laws requiring
physicians and therapists to report suspected child abuse.
   Next came the far-reaching Tarasoff decision by the California
Supreme Court. It requires counselors to warn people who they feel
may be in danger from their patients, based on conclusions stemming
from the patients' treatment. The decision makes thetherapist
liable for civil damages for any harm that may occur.
   Dozens of other court decisions have further limited patient
privacy, and therapists wonder where it will end.
   ``Will we have the same duty to prevent burglary, or if someone
says he is going to punch that kid?'' asked Gary Schoener, a
Minneapolis psychologist who has published many articles on
confidentiality. ``Where do you draw the line? You can't expect the
therapist to do the job of policing society.''

<TEXT>
   Normally oceans apart, the U.S.
Navy's two hospital ships have been brought together for the first
time by the American military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   The USS Comfort, based at Baltimore, and USS Mercy, whose home
port is Oakland, Calif., are assigned to the Atlantic and Pacific
theaters, respectively.
   This month they arrived in the Persian Gulf, preparing to handle
a major influx of battle casualties - up to 2,000 at a time - if
war breaks out.
   It would be the first combat test for the two converted
container ships, painted white with large red crosses in compliance
with the Geneva convention.
   ``We are planning for a massive number of casualties. ... If
there were hostilities, there would be great numbers in the first
few days,'' Capt. Paul D. Barry, who commands medical operations
aboard Mercy, told journalists who visited the ship anchored off
Bahrain on Sunday.
   The Comfort was visible on the horizon several miles away.
   As with a military field hospital, the stess is on triage - the
grim process of evaluating battle injuries to determine which are
most serious yet survivable.
   ``The focus of the trauma medium is on those first few golden
hours,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Martin Robinson, who runs the Mercy's
casualty receiving area. ``The faster you get an individual to a
medical treatment facility, the better their chances are.''
   At 69,000 tons each, the Mercy and Comfort are bigger than
bttleships and exceeded in size among Navy vessels only by
aircraft carriers, which run 75,000 tons and up.
   Each has 1,000 beds, 500 for major cases, the rest for the less
seriously wounded. Only 11 U.S. hospitals are larger.
   On Sunday, only five patients were being treated aboard Mercy,
none of them combat casualties.
   Among the nearly 1,000 people aboard each ship are 570 medical
personnel, including 40 doctors and dentists and 125 nurses. About
30 percent of Mercy's complement are female, and 70 of the
crewmembers are civilians.
   The medical facilities aboard Mercy and Comfort are far advanced
from 25 years ago when two earlier Navy hospital ships, Sanctuary
and Repose, cruised off Vietnam.
   Those two ships were credited with saving the lives of hundreds
of wounded GIs.
   Dr. Robert Cave, 53, of Oakland, a plastic surgeon who served
aboard the Sanctuary in Vietnam, said the Mercy has ``tremendously
more capacity,'' such as 12 operating rooms to the older ship's
three.

<HEAD>Pearl Harbor Attack Inspired by British Novel, Says U.S. Author</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese admiral who planned the Pearl
Harbor attack got the idea from a British novel, says a new book
examining U.S. and Japanese strategy in World War II.
   Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto - who insisted on the 1941 surprise
raid that destroyed much of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at its base in
Hawaii - based his strategy on a book that had Washington buzzing
when Yamamoto was Japanese naval attache here from 1926 to 1928,
says author William H. Honan.
   The 1925 novel, ``The Great Pacific War'' by Hector C. Bywater,
begins with a surprise Japanese attack in 1931 that wipes out much
of the U.S. Asiatic fleet.
   Honan's book, ``Bywater: The Man Who Invented the Pacific War,''
went on sale earlier this month in England. It is due for U.S.
publication in February with the title ``The Man Who Knew Too Much:
How Hector C. Bywater Invented the Great Pacific War.''
   Bywater was a British secret agent in Germany who later became a
leading expert on the world's navies in the pre-jet age, when
national strength was measured in battleship tonnage.
   From 1920 to 1940, he wrote for newspapers and magazines on both
sides of the Atlantic, covered major naval disarmament conferences
in London and Washington and published several books.
   It was more than coincidence that the course of the war was
predicted in Bywater's novel, says author Honan, currently the New
York Times' chief cultural correspondent.
   Honan presents exhaustive research intended to show that
Bywater's writings profoundly influenced Japanese strategists led
by Yamamoto, supreme commander of the Imperial Navy combined fleet
and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack.
   ``The Great Pacific War'' was translated into Japanese and for a
time was required reading for Japanese navy officers. It also
inspired Japanese imitations that switched endings and had the
Japanese winning the war.
   Yamamoto spent a year at Harvard University in 1919 and returned
to America seven years later with the rank of Navy captain for his
Washington stint.
   Back in Japan, Yamamoto in a lecture ``adopted Bywater's ideas
as his own,'' Honan says. The author adds that the Japanese naval
officer in 1941 threatened to resign with his entire staff to force
acceptance of his plan ``to eradicate the American naval presence''
in mid-Pacific at the start of the war.
   This was precisely Bywater's conception, Honan says, and
Yamamoto enhanced it with something not available at the time ``The
Great Pacific War'' first appeared - massed aircraft carriers and
their planes, ``the daring tactical innovation'' of Japanese naval
air chief Minoru Genda.
   Yamamoto followed Bywater ``so assiduously in both overall
strategy and specific tactics at Pearl Harbor, Guam, the
Philippines and even the Battle of Midway that it is no
exaggeration to call Hector Bywater the man who invented the
Pacific War,'' Honan adds.
   Unlike more optimistic Imperial admirals, Yamamoto hedged when
his government tried to assess Japanese prospects in war with the
United States. Quoting the late Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye's
dairy, Honan says Yamamoto told his superiors, ``if you insist on
my going ahead, I can promise to give them hell for a year or a
year and a half, but can guarantee nothing'' beyond.
   This was as if Yamamoto ``had cribbed his answer from The Great
Pacific War'' in which Japanese strength declines after 18 months
of war against an aroused America, Honan continues.
   The U.S. Navy also drew on Bywater's thinking, Honan says.
   Bywater ``knocked some sense into'' the Americans with two
chapters of ``The Great Pacific War,'' exposing weaknesses of the
U.S. contingency war plan in which the Navy would rush
reinforcements across a hostile ocean in a reckless effort at quick
recovery of the Philippines, he says.
   Bywater had the U.S. fleet getting intercepted, severely mauled
and humbled, prompting the United States to redesign ``a carefully
planned step-by-step advance to Manila across a bridge of islands
in the Marshall and Caroline chains. It was the first time a naval
expert had publicly spelled out such a campaign'' of amphibious
landings, says Honan.
   Honan raises but leaves unanswered a question of whether
Japanese agents caused the mid-1940 deaths of Bywater, then 55, in
a London suburb and Bywater's Tokyo source, English journalist
Melville Cox.
   An autopsy, hampered by German air raids during the Battle of
Britain, found that Bywater died of a heart attack and
overdrinking. Cox died in a fall or jump from a window at Tokyo
police headquarters.
   Honan says London Daily Telegraph correspondent E.A. Harwood
theorized in 1987 that Yamamoto ordered the deaths of Bywater and
Cox shortly after committing himself to the Pearl Harbor attack to
keep the two Englishmen from alerting the United States to his war
plan.
   Bywater and Yamamoto had met at the 1934 London naval conference
where, Honan records, they spent one evening together debating
``the future over a bottle of good Scotch.''
   Admiral Yamamoto was killed when his plane was shot down in
1943.

<HEAD>Administration Preparing Two-Part Weapons Plan for Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is readying a plan to
provide weapons needed immediately to protect oil-rich Saudi Arabia
and the American soldiers serving there, says Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   The first phase of a two-part package will be sent to Congress
for approval early this week, Baker said Sunday.
   Baker refused to put a price tag on the package, but other
sources said the first installment will total $10 billion, with the
full plan valued at around $21 billion. The second part is expected
to be sent to Congress early next year.
   President Bush agreed to submit the weapons proposal in two
installments after members of Congress, particularly those close to
Israel, objected to the size of the deal. But Baker, appearing on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' insisted Bush was not revising his
plans for the Saudis.
   ``No, the president has not backed off that,'' Baker said when
asked the administration's position on the $21 billion package.
``The package, however, will be phased.''
   Several members of Congress said they would be willing to
support the $10 billion plan in an election year, but next year's
package could face a tougher time.
   The weapons sale would be the largest in history; the previous
record was an $8 billion package that also went to the Saudis.
   The first installment ``will represent the needs that we think
are immediate for Saudi Arabia, and, frankly, needs that would ...
serve to protect American lives,'' Baker said.
   About 150,000 American soldiers have been deployed in Saudi
Arabia since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2. Baker did
not say specifically what the Pentagon wants to send the Saudis,
but the initial items are expected to include material the United
States could send quickly like anti-tank missiles and trucks.
   The second phase would include more sophisticated weapons such
as the M-1 tank, F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters.
   Saudi government representative Fred Dutton said that country
was not upset at the administration's decision to split the package
in two. As a result of the gulf crisis, the Saudis are enlarging
and restructuring their defenses by calling up volunteers and
beefing up oil field security.
   ``After the dust clears, they will see what their defense
requirements are,'' he said. If the Saudis can't get what they want
from the United States, they'll shop elsewhere, he said. Saudi
Arabia is viewed as a good customer because it pays cash for
weapons.
   Baker, meanwhile, stressed the U.S. desire to resolve the gulf
crisis peacefully through diplomatic means, taking direction from
the United Nations.
   This week, Baker will join other foreign ministers at a U.N.
Security Council meeting in New York where they will discuss
options, including a possible air embargo against Iraq.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Sunday he
``wouldn't be surprised'' if an air embargo is approved this week.
   An air embargo, plus sanctions against countries that violate
the existing U.N. embargo against Iraq, are just two of the
non-military measures at the United Nations' disposal, Baker said
as he played down the threat of war.
   ``I don't think we're running out of non-military type
sanctions,'' he said. ``I think there are a whole host of other
things that might be considered.''
   Nevertheless, Baker said the United States would have an
``appropriate response'' to any Iraqi-inspired acts of terrorism
against American citizens, and would act unilaterally if necessary.
Bush has accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of supporting
terrorist groups.
   On other related issues, Baker also:
   -Said the United States and its allies will accept nothing short
of a complete withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and
restoration of the Kuwaiti government before it considers
negotiating with Saddam.
   -Defended the administration's actions before Saddam's invasion
of Kuwait. He reiterated that the United States followed the proper
course in refusing to take sides in the Iraq-Kuwait border dispute,
and said it was ``ludicrous'' to suggest that ``somehow the United
States contributed to Saddam Hussein's unprovoked aggression''
against Kuwait.

   Governors in Kentucky invariably try to
handpick their successors in a bid to sidestep the state ban on
serving successive terms.
   The ploy hasn't worked in nearly 30 years, but that hasn't
stopped Democratic Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. His wife is among a
field of candidates who have raised over $5 million for a primary
election that won't take place until next May.
   The gubernatorial candidates have raked in so many contributions
that Democrats running in state legislative races this year
complain they are feeling the money pinch.
   Martha Wilkinson recently took in $1.1 million at a single
event. Critics say most of her money comes from people who depend
on state government for their livelihoods.
   ``It is strictly voluntary. There is no - quote - pressure,''
Wilkinson said of the contributions to his wife's campaign.
   She insists she is ``not a surrogate candidate for her husband''
and he says that ``she makes up her own mind about what she wants
to do and she goes and does it.''
   Mrs. Wilkinson refuses to answer questions about her candidacy
or her husband's administration. Her husband said voters don't want
to hear about issues, but at some point she must address a $1.3
billion tax increase enacted this year for education and other
state programs, the hottest topic so far on the campaign trail.
   At one time, Wilkinson toyed with joining his wife on the ticket
as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but talk of the idea has
died.
   The constitutional ban on governors succeeding themselves in
Kentucky traditionally has brought large fields of candidates whose
campaigns begin months, sometimes years, before the election.
   Besides Wilkinson's wife, the Democratic campaigners include:
   -Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones, who once served in the state House in
West Virginia as a Republican.
   -Dr. Floyd G. Poore, who left the Wilkinson administration after
publicly claiming that his Capitol telephone had been bugged.
   -Gatewood Galbraith, who says no new state taxes would be needed
if the state legalized marijuana and regulated it. Galbraith has
drawn few contributions but has reportedly enlisted the aid of
country singer Willie Nelson to help raise money.
   -Scotty Baesler, the three-term mayor of Lexington, who refuses
to rule out the possibility of additional taxes. He has raised
$814,000 for his campaign.
   Jones, who has raised more than $2 million for his campaign,
dates his political conversion to the Watergate scandal.
   ``Dick Nixon made a Democrat out of me,'' says Jones.
   Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor do not run as a
team in Kentucky, and Jones and Wilkinson have feuded from the time
they took office.
   Jones drew heavily on a personal fortune to outdistance a
bloated field in his 1987 primary. In this campaign, he promises no
new taxes. But Poore links Wilkinson and Jones, accusing them of
conspiring to pass the tax increase.
   Poore has vowed to lead a ``tax revolt'' and get the General
Assembly to roll back part of the $1.3 billion tax increase. Poore
has not said what he would cut from the budget to compensate,
saying details will come later.
   A physician, Poore was state transportation secretary under Gov.
Martha Layne Collins and a front office assistant to Wilkinson. But
Collins fired him after he championed an increase in the motor
fuels tax.
   Poore helped raise millions of campaign dollars for Collins and
Wilkinson. According to his last campaign finance report, his own
campaign had taken in $1.1 million.
   On the Republican side, there is:
   -State Rep. John Harper, who carried the Republican banner in
1987 and was beaten in 115 of the state's 120 counties. He lost by
the biggest margin in Kentucky history.
   -Truck-pull promoter Leonard ``Buck'' Beasley, reprising his
1987 candidacy, in which he finished third in the GOP primary.
   The best Republican hope is U.S. Rep. Larry Hopkins, a former
state legislator who was publicly urged by President Bush to take
the gubernatorial plunge.
   The veteran congressman is weighing the chances of becoming the
first Republican elected governor in nearly a quarter century.

<TEXT>
   The 8-year-old grandson of Camp Allen Elementary Principal
Delores Fitzgerald was convinced that poison gas would seep into
his classroom if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried out his
threat to wage a chemical war.
   ``He said, `Gee, that could come over here, couldn't it?'
because he had no idea how far (Iraq) is or what's involved in
fighting with chemicals,'' said Fitzgerald.
   The principal of the Camp Allen school in Norfolk, Va., was
describing what classroom teachers face when trying to keep
schoolchildren abreast of rapidly escalating events in the Persian
Gulf.
   Maps and globes of the Persian Gulf are becoming frequent
reference points in classrooms across the nation as teachers focus
on chess-game movements in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
   But teachers also must reassure students who don't understand
the threats of chemical war, or those whose parents are among the
165,000 U.S. military personnel in the region.
   ``Children are exposed to a lot of things they are not simply
mature enough to understand,'' said Fitzgerald, pointing to
television and newspaper coverage of the crisis.
   More than 90 percent of Camp Allen's 774 students are military
dependents. Fitzgerald said about 200 of them have one or both
parents deployed overseas - either to the Persian Gulf or
elsewhere.
   Fitzgerald said the pre-kindergarten through fifth grade school
is adding information to its entire curriculum on Middle Eastern
customs, the type of government, weather and economics. Some of the
teaching strategies were provided during special training sessions
held by the Navy Family Services.
   The school also holds about 17 small group sessions once a week
for students with parents overseas, Fitzgerald said.
   ``Kids always have problems when a parent is deployed, even if
it's for a six- or nine-month exercise in peacetime,'' said
Fitzgerald, noting that teachers are trained to look for unusual
behavior such as a child's reluctance to leave home or reluctance
to leave school.
   Richard Bowers, coordinator of psychological services for the
Norfolk Public Schools, said his staff of 21 psychologists has
developed special strategies for helping students who are
experiencing anxiety about the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I can't say we've had an influx of referrals,'' said Bowers.
``But we try to be preventive. We try to stay ahead of (crisis) so
it won't get away from us.''
   Janie Smalls, a guidance counselor at Shell Point Elementary in
Beaufort, S.C., said a small group has been formed called ``Dad is
Gone'' for children with fathers overseas. Videotapes are being
made to send to the fathers and officials are talking to mothers
about how to reassure their children.
   Smalls said some children may misbehave, go through emotional
withdrawal or perform poorly in school due to a parent's absence.
   At Holbrook Elementary at Ft. Bragg, N.C., teachers put together
an elaborate Middle Eastern display for the main trophy case,
including maps, clothing, and a well-worn camel saddle. Classes are
being brought periodically to the exhibit for a lesson on the
Middle East.
   ``Maps of the Persian Gulf came out of the closet all of a
sudden and many students showed an interest in Middle Eastern
culture,'' said Dick Phebus, principal of Battery Creek High School
in Beaufort. Twenty percent of the school's 1,150 students are from
military families at the Marine Corps Air Station.
   Principal Della A. Zaher of Miami Shores Elementary School in
Dade County, Fla., vividly remembers her conversation with a
frightened fifth grader, who said, ``A war could end the earth.''
   ``We've tried to treat this as a very important national issue,
but we don't want to alarm anyone. Kids worry about bombs, about
members of the family sent overseas. It's the unknown that's
frightful. We want to eliminate misinformation,'' she said.
   The plan, Zaher said, is to give students as much information as
possible. The 970 summer school students attentively watched
televised coverage of President Bush's first news conference on the
crisis.
   With regular school back in session, Zaher said a
student-produced news program for the 1,600-member student body
almost always includes events in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We thrive on the fact that we keep our kids informed,'' said
Zaher, whose award-winning kindergarten through fifth grade school
has a student body that is about 50 percent Haitian, 22 percent

   The average price of a gallon of gasoline at
the pump has hit an all-time high of more than $1.38, an industry
analyst says.
   The price has gone up from around $1.18 in late July, shortly
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and jumped 2.91 cents
in the two weeks since the previous survey, said the nationwide
Lundberg Survey of 18,500 gas stations.
   ``The fears are that a war could create a serious supply
upheaval and that supply replacement could be difficult,'' said
Trilby Lundberg.
   The twice-monthly survey conducted last week showed motorists
were paying an average of $1.3835 per gallon, up from $1.3544 on
Sept. 7, Ms. Lundberg said Sunday.
   The previous record was just under $1.38, set in March 1981, she
said.
   Analysts cited continued fear of war in the Middle East among
reasons for the surge in crude oil prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on Friday.
   The price of crude for October delivery rose $1.53 a barrel, to
$34.71, the highest level in nine years.
   Lundberg's survey showed that at self-service pumps, on average,
regular unleaded gasoline sold for $1.2736 a gallon, premium
unleaded $1.4405 and regular leaded $1.2551.
   At full-service stations, regular unleaded was $1.4959 a gallon,
premium unleaded $1.6319 and regular leaded $1.4783.

<HEAD>40 Dead In Northern Mexico Storm, Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHIHUAHUA CITY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heaviest rainstorm in 90 years
flooded large sections of this northern Mexico state capital on
Sunday, killing at least 40 people and leaving more than 5,000
homeless, authorities said.
   Another 30 people were reported missing by the Red Cross.
   The storm, which hit Saturday night, dumped more than 5 inches
in the area around Chihuahua City, about 200 miles south of El
Paso, Texas.
   It was still raining in the city of 600,000 late Sunday and rain
was forecast to continue for several days.
   Authorities feared that the Chihuahua and Chuviscas dams would
overflow and firemen, police and army troops began evacuating 10
neighborhoods near the two dams on Sunday night.
   More than 350 homes were destroyed and another 1,000 damaged,
said Gov. Fernando Baeza Melendez, who declared an emergency in the
area around the Chihuahua state capital.
   About 60 neighborhoods were without running water, he said.
   Dozens of homes in the city's six low-lying neighborhoods either
collapsed or were swept away by floods, and several hundred
residents had to evacuate their homes, Chihuahua City police chief
Jesus Dover said.
   ``A state of alert (emergency) has been declared, but everything
is quiet,'' said Red Cross radio dispatcher Heriberto Perez. ``In
some places the water was 1{ to 3 meters (4 to 9 feet) deep.''
   Angel Alvarez Gomez, a weather service meteorologist, was quoted
by the government news agency Notimex as saying the storms dumped
more than 5 inches of water in the area around the capital. He
called it Chihuahua's heaviest downpour in 90 years.

   A group of leading environmental organizations
is trying to break into one of America's richest sources of funding
- the annual workplace charity campaigns widely identified with the
United Way.
   The 23-member Environmental Federation of America has
participated in federal, state and city government employee charity
campaigns in the two years since its founding.
   Now it is trying to get its foot in the door of corporate
payroll deduction campaigns as well.
   Kal Stein, the federation's executive director, said he hopes to
be raising $400 million a year for environmental causes within 10
years. This year's goal is a more modest $7 million.
   ``We don't want to hurt United Way. We want to complement what
they do,'' Stein told reporters recently.
   Stein said research showed that when employees are given more
options in a workplace charity drive, they increase their giving,
with United Way getting as much as before.
   ``In fact, United Way charities generally did better than their
average when faced with multiple choice campaigns,'' says a
statement prepared by the federation.
   ``That is not our experience,'' responded Tony de Cristofaro,
spokesman for United Way of America in Alexandria, Va. ``When there
are multiple groups competing, there are fewer dollars for local
health and human needs.''
   De Cristofaro said the 1,400 local United Way campaigns make
their own decisions about what groups qualify to share in workplace
donations.
   ``In some places environmental causes are included. In other
places they are not,'' he said in an interview. ``Clearly people in
the local community know best what's needed.''
   Local leaders of many United Way campaigns have been taking a
new look at what sorts of charities should be included, de
Cristofaro said.
   ``United Ways need to examine what they're doing in the light of
what donors want to do,'' he said. ``What the communities have been
counting on us to do is deal with the priority health and human
services needs in the communities.''
   Stein said his new national organization was affiliated with
similar environmental federations set up in recent years in
California, Oregon and Washington to participate in workplace
charity campaigns.
   One of the Environmental Federation of America's first campaigns
among workers at a private business will be carried out this year
at the Washington law firm Arnold and Porter, which has about 1,000
employees.
   James W. Jones, the firm's managing partner, said the decision
to participate was intended to give employees a wider range of
choices and to help identify Arnold and Porter with environmental
protection.
   ``Environmental concerns, if not the issue of the 1990s, is
going to be one of the issues of the 1990s,'' he said.
   The 23 groups that make up the federation include the Wilderness
Society, Friends of the Earth, the Environmental Defense Fund, the
Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.
   Donations can be designated for a particular group. Of the money
that is not earmarked, half is divided equally among the 23
federation members and the rest is split up in proportion to how
often each group was designated by other donors.
   Stein said the federation's administration costs were about 8
percent of total donations.
   Participating groups are required to meet standards on financial
accounting and on policy, Stein said. For example, groups
advocating illegal direct action are not accepted.
   ``Tree-spikers need not apply,'' he said.
   The federation expects to add a limited number of new groups
each year, and is not sure how it will respond to expected
applications from organizations with an environmental connection
but a primary focus on animal rights, peace, energy or some other
topic.
   ``This is a tough question, deciding what is an environmental
group,'' Stein said. ``That will evolve on a case-by-case basis.''

<HEAD>Food Aid Programs' Emphasis Changing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donations and concessional sales of food to
needy countries has been a large-scale operation since World War
II, but an Agriculture Department report says humanitarian concerns
have not always been the prime motive.
   ``Food aid policies and programs are changing,'' the report
said. ``Donor nations, including the United States, are putting
more emphasis on the needs of the recipient countries and less on
their own domestic concerns.''
   The report, published in Farmline magazine, was based on studies
by Shahla Shapouri and Margaret Missiaen of the department's
Economic Research Service.
   An objective of the study was to determine to what extent food
aid programs were designed as an outlet for surplus commodities, as
a means of developing new markets, or as help for people in need.
   Internal policies also play a part in determining a country's
food aid to foreigners, the report said.
   For example, farmers may favor cutbacks in production to keep
commodity prices relatively high, but foreign policy planners may
want greater bumper crops and lower prices in order to help Third
World countries that are strategically important.
   The economists looked at the food aid programs of the United
States, Canada and the European Community, which have been the
primary sources of world food assistance since the early 1970s.
   Over the years, they found, food aid has grown more
``humanitarian'' as emphasis has shifted more heavily to the needs
of recipients.
   Also, there has been an expansion of multilateral assistance
through such organizations as the World Food Program of the United
Nations. About one-fourth of the grain moving as food aid is now
supplied multilaterally.
   The United States continues to provide more than half of the
grain aid to foreign aid recipients, although the tonnage has
declined in recent years. Also, the U.S. share in relation to
donations by Canada and the EC has declined.
   ``Canada's food aid programs, like those of the United States,
were established largely to dispose of surplus production,'' the
report said.
   But Canada's aid has been donated, while most of the U.S. food
assistance has been concessional sales, including long-term,
low-interest credit arrangements.
   In 1975, major recipients of U.S. food aid included Bangladesh,
28 percent; India, 28 percent; Pakistan, 19 percent; and Egypt, 14
percent. All other countries had shares of 4 percent or less.
   By 1985, the biggest were Egypt, 29 percent; and Sudan, 7
percent. Other U.S. food recipients had shares of 6 percent or
less.
   The most powerful common factors affecting food aid assignment
by the United States, Canada and the 12-nation community to certain
countries were ``a trend of low food production and an economic
relationship with the donor country,'' the report said.
   ``Trading relations between the needy country and the donor also
influenced aid,'' it said. ``Countries that had stronger trade ties
with the donor countries were more likely to receive assistance.''
   For example, the United States ``has directed aid toward Latin
American and Caribbean countries with which it has strong trade
relations,'' the report said. ``Canada has assisted fellow members
of the Commonwealth of Nations, and the EC has helped former
colonies of member countries.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department has scheduled two
public meetings on whether to declare Melaleuca quinquenervia a
federal noxious weed.
   The question seems to be, is it friend or foe?
   Melaleuca is described as a ``non-native'' tree that was
introduced in Florida in the early 1900s. It was widely planted in
the 1940s and 1950s because of its ability to control soil erosion,
and for natural fences and windbreaks.
   Beekeepers also like Melaleuca ``because it flowers when few
other plants do, thus helping bees'' through the winter, said the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   But Florida officials are concerned that uncontrolled spread of
the Melaleuca species could threaten rare plants and animals,
interfere with water supplies and eventually jeopardize the
Everglades, said James W. Glosser, administrator of the USDA
agency.
   Public comments ``will help us decide whether to issue a rule
proposing to add Melaleuca to the list of noxious weeds,'' he said.
If it is added to the list, federal restrictions would be
authorized on imports and interstate movement of the plant.
   The tree covers about 1.5 million acres in southern Florida, he
said, in addition to plantings in California, Hawaii, Texas and
Puerto Rico.
   Public meetings will be held Oct. 29 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and on Oct. 31 in San Francisco.
   A notice was scheduled for publication today in the Federal
Register, the government's official rule-making document.
   Comments can be sent by Nov. 24 to: Chief, Regulatory Analysis
and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room 866, Federal Building, 6505
Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Md. 20782. Refer to docket 90-158.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Farm-grown catfish delivered to processors in
August totaled 31.1 million pounds, a 10 percent increase from a
year earlier, according to a monthly Agriculture Department report.
   Prices paid to growers last month averaged 79 cents per pound,
up 11 cents from August 1989, the report said.
   Through the first eight months, production totaled 250.2 million
pounds, up 11 percent from January-August of last year.

   The World Bank says it is learning from past
environmental mistakes as it draws up plans for new Third World
development projects.
   The 152-nation body has been accused of financing large-scale
destruction of rain forests, river valleys and other sensitive
ecosystems. Issuing its first annual report on Sunday, the bank
said nearly half of last year's new loans will do something to help
the environment.
   Procedures set up last year should assure new projects are not
environmentally and socially destructive, it said.
   ``The bank must ensure that the lessons of past problems are
quickly reflected in future policy adjustments,'' the report said.
   The World Bank lends about $20 billion each year at low interest
rates to encourage development in poor and middle-income countries.
   Its report acknowledges that in the mid-1980s there were ``a few
well-publicized cases in which bank projects actually had negative
environmental consequences - such as contributing to the
destruction of tropical rain forests and posing threats to
wildlife, indigenous people and established human settlements.''
   A coalition of international environmental groups said the
report was intended ``to deflect public criticism of the World
Bank's role in the degradation of the global environment.''
   Kenneth Piddington, the bank's environment director, told a news
conference his goal was to make sure environmental concerns are
addressed ``early in the pipeline'' of project consideration by
World Bank economists, not just later by his staff.
   ``We are working as an environmental team,'' Piddington said.
``We do not make the claim that having made some progress, we have
avoided all the problems.''
   Since last October, borrowing countries have been required to
draw up environmental assessments for any new projects that will
have significant environmental impacts.
   The report, covering the fiscal year ended in June 1990, said 11
loans totaling $403.9 million were approved last year exclusively
for environmental projects, up from just two loans in fiscal 1989.
The projects range from helping Poland develop air and water
pollution control policies to funding a comprehensive environmental
program in Madagascar.
   Funding for 45 more such projects is expected in the next three
years.
   In addition, the report said, 107 of last year's 222 new loans -
or 48 percent - have some ``environmental component.''
   Examples cited include energy conservation measures that are
part of an electricity project in Brazil, pollution controls on a
petrochemical development project in India and improving vehicle
emission controls in a highway project in Mauritius.
   The environmental report was issued in connection with this
week's annual meetings of the 152-nation World Bank and its sister
organization, the International Monetary Fund.
   About 150 representatives of international development and
environmental groups critical of World Bank projects also are
meeting in Washington to protest what they see as the bank's
abuses.
   The assembly, called the People's Network for Eco Development,
issued a statement calling the report a ``blatant exercise in
misinformation.''
   Emmy Hafild of the Indonesian Environmental Forum said it was
``nothing more than a green gimmick designed to mislead the public
and quell criticism.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Dole Tired of `Sitting Around and Doing Nothing'
on Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole is again
displaying one of the reasons he has never been successful in
seeking national office: He wants to get things done.
   ``I think the American people are tired of us sitting around and
sitting around and doing nothing,'' Dole said Sunday, defending his
suggestion that GOP budget negotiators set aside President Bush's
pledge to cut capital gains taxes.
   His move shook things up but it was no surprise. It was vintage
Dole. Having fought for months to win a party victory, it now was
time to pass some legislation.
   It's an attitude that Dole needed when Republicans controlled
the Senate for six years in the early and mid 1980s, including two
with Dole as the majority leader. It's also an attitude that can
cost a politician dearly.
   Dole's legendary nasty streak usually gets the blame for his
failures.
   That urge caused him to blurt out in a 1976 debate with fellow
vice presidential candidate Walter Mondale that the United States
was always fighting ``Democrat wars.'' The comment helped topple
the GOP ticket headed by President Ford.
   And in 1988, after losing in the New Hampshire primary to Bush,
he caustically told the victor to ``stop lying about my record.''
It was an ugly display that helped collapse Dole's still-promising
campaign.
   Bush's campaign succeeded in tagging Dole with the fatal label
of tax-raiser because Dole was and is a master of cutting deals in
Congress - including deficit-reduction packages in the early 1980s
that included tax increases.
   Although President Reagan signed those bills, Vice President
Bush's fingerprints weren't on them. And whatever stands he took as
a congressman two decades ago were too remote to do him any harm
during the campaign.
   Now, Dole's presidential hopes having slipped to hopeless, he
again seems to be the one to get something done - acknowledging
that the result is bound to have unpopular elements that could cost
its supporters politically.
   Dole bolted from the Bush-led GOP position that any
deficit-reduction agreement had to include a capital gains tax cut,
but not because he opposed the idea. It's just that, to him, it
wasn't worth four months of budget talks coming to naught.
   Specifically, Dole suggested taking capital gains out of the
basic deficit-reduction package and putting it and other
``goodies'' into a separate bill for a separate congressional vote.
   He didn't have to point out that the move would hurt chances of
passing the capital gains cut. Dole is one of those old-fashioned
Republicans who still believes in balanced budgets, and that is a
higher priority to him than the supply-side economics adopted by
many in his party, including Bush.
   ``My view is, we need to get this done. We ought to stop dancing
around capital gains, face up to it, get it resolved, and get this
package put to bed,'' he said Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation'' program.
   ``I think we're losing sight of what we got together for, that's
deficit reduction. Now with all the focus on capital gains - we
better get back to deficit reduction or we're going to have some
real problems,'' he said.
   Dole took a similar position last year, when Congress was trying
to wrap up its session and the Democratic leadership was
successfully blocking a capital gains tax cut. The White House, on
advice from Dole, gave up to fight another day.
   The bottom line is that Dole is a ``player,'' a lawmaker who
knows how the legislative sausage-factory works and is sometimes
willing to settle for legislation that is less than perfect. It's
an attitude that draws plaudits within Congress but not so much
outside the Capitol.
   Even within Congress, Dole draws the ire of purists such as Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who once called Dole the ``tax collector for
the liberal welfare state.''
   Gingrich now is the house minority whip and one of the GOP
budget negotiators. He is getting a taste of the political choices
Dole has faced for years. Dole must be savoring the possibilities.

   Police said they were not ruling
out political motives in the fatal shooting of a Washington,
D.C.-area anti-communist Vietnamese columnist and his wife.
   Fairfax County police said they had no suspects in the deaths of
Triet Le, 61, and his wife, Tuyet Thi Dangtran. Officials said the
two died from multiple gunshot wounds suffered Saturday night while
in their automobile in the driveway of their home.
   Associates of one of the victims said politics was clearly
behind the slayings. Triet Le was the second of a Vietnamese
magazine's 10-member staff to be gunned down within a year.
   Triet Le, an editor for Tien Phong, a magazine based in
Arlington, Va., often wrote what employees called ``controversial''
articles critical of communists and leaders of the left.
   Staff members said the slain man had a lot of enemies and
received numerous threats, which he mentioned in some of his
articles.
   Threats against Triet Le might account for his home's elaborate
security system, which included sensors, high-intensity lights and
cameras.
   An array of high security mechanisms also are in place at the
magazine's headquarters.
   Last November, 56-year-old Nhan Trong Do, who worked as a layout
artist for the magazine, was shot several times inside his car.
   Fairfax County Prosecutor Robert Horan said last December that
police had considered political motivation as a reason behind the
layout artist's murder.
   Triet Le escaped from his country, where he was a second
lieutenant in the South Vietnamese army during the war. He came to
the United States in 1975.

<HEAD>Report: Government Spent $1.7 Billion More in 1989 on Families of
Teens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly released figures illustrate the need for
greater efforts to prevent teen-age pregnancies, says a report by a
group that concentrates on worldwide population issues.
   The report, released Sunday, said the federal government spent
more than $21.5 billion last year on welfare programs for families
started by teen-agers. The amount is $1.7 billion higher than for
1988 - partly because of inflation and expansion of Medicaid
benefits but also due to an increase in births to teen-agers, said
report by the private Center for Population Options.
   The group said the report pointed to a need for greater efforts
to curb teen pregnancies, including sex education, family planning
counseling, support for delaying sexual activity, access to
contraception, and medical services, including abortion.
   ``We can no longer let our youth stumble into parenting, a
course that should be embarked on only when one is ready, willing
and able to become a parent,'' the report said.
   The costs of teen-age pregnancies go far beyond those of public
support, the report said.
   ``Too-early childbearing often impoverishes ... the lives of
girls brought too soon into the rigors and responsibilities of
motherhood, of boys bewildered and unable to parent and provide
adequately, of babies not planned or welcomed,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Washington Post Defends Reporter Arrested While Working on Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post has branded as
``unwarranted'' the arrest of one of its reporters charged with
contributing to the delinquency of a minor while pursuing a story
on a youth curfew.
   Michael J. Ybarra, 23, a Post metro staff reporter, was arrested
late Friday while working on a report about a new curfew for minors
in Quantico, Va.
   ``Based on the information we have, the arrest of a Washington
Post reporter while he is reporting a story and breaking no law
himself appears unwarranted to us,'' Post Managing Editor Leonard
Downie Jr. said.
   ``I'm particularly concerned that the police pursued this after
the reporter identified himself and his purpose and that the police
took his notes,'' Downie said.
   Ybarra was taken into custody and his notes confiscated while he
was interviewing two 12-year-old boys in a restaurant in the
Virginia town, about 30 miles south of the nation's capital.
   The Quantico Town Council recently imposed the 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the
area.
   Ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew
violation, but no youths have been arrested.
   ``I believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just
got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time,'' Quantico
Police Chief Leo Rodriguez said.
   The police chief said the reporter's notes were being held as
evidence but a copy would be made available to the Post.
   Ybarra was released on his own recognizance and is to be
arraigned in Prince William County Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court on Tuesday. He faces a maximum one-year jail term and a
$2,500 fine.
   Ybarra's supervisors said the reporter was not available for
comment concerning the incident.

   Here are excerpts from the communique
issued Sunday after a joint meeting of Iraq's ruling Revolution
Command Council and Baath Party. The Arabic statement was
translated by The Associated Press:
   ---
   America is commiting deep criminal acts against Iraq and the
Ara nation especially in occupying the Arab and Moslem holy places
in Najd and Hejaz (the former name for the territory that became
Saudi Arabia), and in its sanctions imposed against the Iraqi
people in a way that exceeds all humanitarian limits.
   The United States, thus, has gone far below the minimum level of
human standards toward which even those who believe in the law of
the jungle would not stop.
   America did all this to satisfy its arrogance and enforce its
hegemony on the entire world...
   America must not go too far and must get out of its mind the
idea of pushing events into a military collision, and it must
realize the dangers of what it calls a lightning strike.
   It should also abandon all this and remedy it as soon as
possible, by returning to the innermost parts of itself so as to
search for remnants of wisdom to aid it so as to turn away from
this dangerous approach, as soon as possible. Primarily, it should
withdraw from the holy lands of the Arabs and Moslems.
   America must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire
region, and not only Iraq - in fact, even the whole world, foremost
of which its sons whom (President) Bush brought to the region - to
the brink of a bottomless abyss, from which the region will never
see light for dozens of years...
   The oil, the areas it is in and Israel will be transformed into
something different from what they are now.
   We will never allow anybody, whomever he may be, to strangle the
people of Iraq without having himself strangled. If we feel that
the Iraqi people are being strangled, that there are some who will
deal a sanguinary blow to it, we will strangle all those who are
the cause of this.
   The oil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region,
all the oil installations, will be rendered incapable of responding
to the needs of those who came to us as occupiers in order to usurp
our sovereignty, dignity and wealth.
   Israel will be included in all actions that affect the owners of
the homeland in which the forces of evil and occupation have
settled, and in which nothing has maintained its purity except for
the holy places and the generous people who reject this injustice
and aggression...
   Those who wish the flood to overtake the Iraqi people and the
nation, and are planning for this, should remember well that the
waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the
Iraqi people...
   America, and those who instigated it or collaborated with it,
should realize this well so as to reassess matters and to think
again in the correct and precise manner upon which they should
build. The reckless, odious, and foolish behavior that has occurred
so far should be enough for them...
   Everybody should also realize that what we have warned against
might happen when the sparks come out of the barrels of confronting
guns, and out of the friction of the fleets of aggression with our
means and forces.
   The sparks might fly by mistake or deliberately to afterward
cause a huge conflagration. When this happens, a flood will ensue.
To prevent the feared eventuality from taking place, those
concerned should pull back armies as well as navy and air fleets as
soon as possible.
   Dire consequences will befall those who love to create wars,
problems, and crises. They will also befall evildoers and back
stabbers...
   As for the Arabs who are launching good offices, they are urged
not to replace the solution that we offered on 12th August with a
partial solution, as turning the conflict from one concerning major
issues into one regarding minor issues benefits the tactics of the
enemies and their supporters...
   The major issue concerns the struggle of the Arabs and Mosless
in their righteous jihad (holy war) against falsehood. The prime
objective is the liberation of Palestine from the usurpation of the
Zionist usurpers...
   Iraq's adherence to this position through an unequivocal
declared policy has caused the evil arrows to be directed against
it and caused the poisonous wasps to leave their holes to sting its
sides and cause them to bleed in the most dangerous conspiracy that
seeks to inflict political and economic harm on Iraq to prepare for
the military weakening of Iraq and also for the weakening of its
nationalist, pan-Arab, and humanitarian role.
   The conspiracy and those behind it have been exposed. At the
forefront of those charged with staging the conspiracy were the
former rulers of Kuwait who used Kuwait, which was separated from
Iraq, as a base for a counterconspiracy. They have massed its
stolen resources to serve everything that would bring evil and
disgrace to the national and Islamic struggle...
   The blow dealt to that evil ruling clique, the agent of the
foreigner, was an indispensable defensive move to maintain Iraq's
features and resources and improve them in order to achieve the
well-known noble objectives...
   Thus, usurped Kuwait was restored to its people to be part of
its original nation by an eternal decision from which there can be
no retreat under any circumstances or conditions.

<HEAD>Historic Courthouse Survives Hurricane and Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charleston's historic ``Four Corners of
Law'' is only three-quarters occupied these days.
   Charleston County's 198-year-old courthouse, which is on one of
those corners, stands empty, its windows still taped to protect
them from Hurricane Hugo one year ago.
   It might appear that the building, on the foundation of South
Carolina's first Statehouse, has been forgotten since the stomm's
135 mph winds ripped off the roof.
   Looks are deceiving.
   Plans are under way to renovate the historic courthouse at
Meeting and Broad streets, Charleston's most famous intersection.
   Buildings at the intersection's four corners - St. Michael's
Episcopal Church, City Hall, the federal courthouse and the county
courthouse - represent God's law as well as city, federal and state
law.
   Some historians say James Hoban, the Charleston architect who
designed the first White House, drew heavily on the courthouse in
his design. The original White House was burned by the British in
the War of 1812.
   Before Hugo, architect Dinos Liollio was hired to study
renovation of the courthouse's exterior. After Hugo, the work was
expanded to include interior renovations, replacing the roof and
reinforcing the building to withstand earthquakes.
   The county, in the meantime, moved its courts to North
Charleston.
   Renovations may cost about $5.5 million and take more than a
year when plans are complete. But the exterior should remain much
as it is.
   ``As for the interior, we don't know at this time. The building
has to respond to the needs of the 21st century although it was
built in the 18th century,'' Liollio said.
   The original 1792 courthouse was modified in 1884, an addition
built in the 1920s and another in 1941, Liollio said.
   Hugo wrenched the roof off and left an inch of water covering
the floors. It wasn't the first disaster the courthouse survived.
   An earthquake in 1886 caused heavy damage and toppled its
chimneys. There was talk of razing the building at the time, but
repairs were made.
   The original Statehouse was built on the site in 1753. Under the
foundation are the original walls of Charleston. The structure
burned in 1788, two years after the decision to move the capital to
Columbia and a year before construction began on the Statehouse
there, Liollio said.
   When a new building was finished in Charleston, residents
continued calling it the Statehouse, in hopes the Legislature might
one day return from Columbia.
   For a time state functions were split between the cities. The
secretary of state and surveyor general had offices in both cities
and the state court of appeals met in both locations.
   The governor could reside in either city, although when the
Legislature was in session he had to reside in Columbia.
   A thunderstorm disrupted a candlelight observance Friday at City
Hall to mark the first anniversary of Hugo. The ceremony drew about
1,000 people.
   Hugo killed 29 people and caused about $5.9 billion in damage in
South Carolina. It also killed at least 56 people and caused more
than $2 bllion in damage in the Caribbean.

<HEAD>Officials Say Iraqis Spent Years Plotting Kuwait Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq conducted secret military exercises for
at least two years in preparation for its invasion of Kuwait, a
newspaper reported today.
   The invasion was part of a war plan drafted as many as five
years ago by President Saddam Hussein that had as its goal the
seizure of eastern Saudi Arabian oil fields, the Los Angeles Times
said.
   Iraqi forces as recently as mid-July held exercises for forces
used in the Aug. 2 helicopter-borne assault on Kuwait City, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified U.S. officials.
   U.S. officials have been accused of failing to predict the
invasion even after Iraqi forces began massing on the Kuwaiti
border weeks before the attack.
   Administration officials have said the intelligence community
provided adequate warning that Iraq was capable of attack. But they
say policy-makers discounted the alert, believing the buildup was
only a show of force.
   The United States was so ill-prepared for the invasion that U.S.
warships sent to the region after the attack waited days before
maps of Kuwait and Iraq could be loaded into computers used for
guiding weapons, the officials said.

   The last scheduled evacuation flight
out of Kuwait ended with glimmers of hope and pride from the
passengers.
   A diabetic was the first off the U.S.-chartered jet Sunday. She
walked slowly and clutched an American flag.
   ``She was in pain but she insisted on walking off. You could see
she had a lot of pride,'' said Joe Myers, director of North
Carolina's Division of Emergency Management. ``These people seemed
very relieved to be here. You could see it on their faces.''
   Evacuee Khalid Abdu, 28, a U.S. citizen for only four months,
said it wasn't too late for negotiation and a peaceful solution to
the Persian Gulf crisis, but he wasn't optimistic.
   ``From my own point of view, it will get worse. The Iraqis will
not back up from Kuwait,'' said Abdu, who was born in what is now
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   The World Airways DC-10 carried 41 Americans, 43 Jordanians,
seven Palestinians, four Iraqis and two Kuwaitees from Baghdad to
Raleigh-Durham Airport. Twenty-nine passengers got off in London.
   Abdu, the only evacuee to speak to reporters at the airport,
graduated from the University of Wisconsin and worked in a heavy
equipment business with his father, who stayed in Kuwait. He also
left behind his mother, two sisters and brother.
   ``The Iraqis are responsible for what has happened to Kuwait.
The U.S. is responsible for what will happen in Kuwait,'' Abdu
said.
   He said he will stay in North Carolina and find work as a taxi
driver.
   The diabetic woman, who was not identified by officials, was
taken to Raleigh's Rex Hospital, where she was held overnight and
reported in satisfactory condition.
   The passengers were in better health than those who arrived at
Raleigh-Durham on a similar flight last week, officials said. Sixty
people were treated Thursday for dehydration and dysentery after
their arrival.
   Like other evacuation flights, the refugees traveled overland
from Kuwait to Baghdad, where they boarded a chartered jet.
   Twenty of Sunday's passengers planned to fly on to California
and 11 each to Texas and Michigan, Myers said.
   It was the last scheduled U.S.-chartered flight from Baghdad.
About 2,500 Americans have left Iraq and Kuwait since Aug. 2, when
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Evacuation flights that began earlier this month have brought
more than 1,800 people - mostly women and children - back to the
United States, the State Department said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has refused to allow many men to
leave and has sent those who have been captured to strategic
military and industrial sites as a safeguard against attack.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature voted Monday to reverse
seven decades of Communist-style economics, giving preliminary
approval to a rescue plan for switching the Soviet Union to a free
market economy.
   Members of the Supreme Soviet voted 323-11 to endorse a
blueprint for making the economic conversion within 500 days. It
was not immediately clear when the program would begin.
   Fifty-six legislators abstained from the historic vote.
   There was no applause or other display of emotion when the
electronic vote result was announced, not even by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev sitting alone on a raised stage in the chamber.
   The lawmakers then began debating the resolution clause by
clause. They were to vote on possible amendments later Monday.
   The program would reverse the basic aim of the Bolshevik
Revolution and Stalin's brutal collectivism, whose legacy is an
inefficient economy where food rots on its way to market and
consumer shortages now include bread.
   It would create a federation of republics with economies built
on private businesses, individually owned farms and stock markets
trading shares in competitive companies.
   The program marked a significant change in Gorbachev's tactics.
His perestroika program had been aimed at ``restructuring''
centralized socialism, but now is moving toward destroying it.
   Lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on the program on Friday,
but failed to muster a quorum and had to adjourn to Monday.
   Gorbachev had expressed frustration on Friday, saying there was
no more time to ``talk, think, try and experiment.''
   The resolution endorses Gorbachev's compromise economic program,
but also says the more conservative recipe drafted by Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov should be incorporated into it.
   A third, more radical plan, has been adopted by the Russian
Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics with half the
country's people and three-quarters of its territory.
   Previous attempts to merge the conflicting proposals have failed
because they are so fundamentally different.
   Monday's resolution says a final detailed program should be
presented to the Supreme Soviet by Oct. 15. It is to be developed
by legislative committees and the authors of the various programs.
   The Soviet public has become increasingly disappointed in
Gorbachev's handling of the economic crisis, and dozens of
protesters chanted at lawmakers as they arrived for the morning
debate.
   ``The people don't trust Gorbachev,'' about a dozen
demonstrators shouted outside the Kremlin's Spassky Gate. They held
signs that read ``a president - not an emperor'' and ``all decrees
of the president are battles against democracy.''
   Gorbachev on Friday requested sweeping new emergency powers to
implement the economic program and restore law and order. The
Supreme Soviet was expected to vote on his request later Monday.

   King Hussein of Jordan, in a message published
today, said events in the Persian Gulf threaten to lead to reprise
of 1914, ``when the world stumbled into a war it did not want but
could not stop.''
   Recalling the outbreak 76 years ago of World War I, the king
wrote in The Guardian that he believes a war can still be
prevented. But he said if one breaks out, it will be impossible to
limit.
   Hussein has tried to walk a diplomatic tightrope during the
crisis. He has called for a negotiated solution, denouncing the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but refusing to support the U.S.-led
military buildup standing up to Iraq.
   In a broadcast message to the American people, the king declared
Saturday that his country would never recognize Iraq's occupation
of Kuwait.
   But he also urged the United States to get out of Saudi Arabia
``within the shortest period of time.''
   The Guardian said it was publishing Hussein's remarks as a
``special message.'' His words were published across the top of the
daily's front page.
   ``It is very disturbing that some believe military action is the
only solution. This is dangerously short-sighted,'' wrote Hussein.
``The effects of a war against Iraq will not be limited to the
confines of that country.
   ``They will reverberate in every capital throughout the Middle
East. They will create the very instability such action was
designed to prevent.
   ``As for victors and spoils, Middle East wars have produced
neither, only graveyards for false illusions and the seeds for
future wars,'' the king wrote.
   ``If the same effort by the world community in the present
marshalling of military forces, the imposition of sanctions and the
commitment of colossal sums of money were to be applied to a
political solution, I am convinced it could be achieved.''
   Jordan is sandwiched between Israel, Syria, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.
   It has been flooded with refugees from Kuwait and Iraq since the
Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, ordered his troops into Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   A U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq has deprived Jordan of
desperately needed commerce.
   In his message, King Hussein said many who live in the region
feel helpless to prevent war.
   But he wrote, ``I am stubborn enough to believe there is still a
chance to prevent war. I refuse to concede that events cannot be
brought under control.''
   The king said a peaceful solution would have to address what he
called the ``major underlying causes'' of the crisis.
   He listed these as: ``the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, the
imbalance of wealth in the area, the unresolved confrontation
between Israel, Palestine and the Arab states, and the perilous
escalation and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.''
   Saddam has linked a settlement of the crisis to an accord on the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   To attempt to solve the region's problems by military means
treats only the symptoms, not the causes, and would aggravate
problems, the king said.
   ``The area is exhausted from the conflicts and tensions it has
endured for decades. ... The Middle East cannot afford another war.
The world should not impose one on it,'' he said.
   ``I am certain that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the
leaders of this world to devise a peaceful solution to the crisis.
God help us if they cannot.''

   Suspected leftist rebels have kidnapped at
gunpoint the vice president of the Peruvian legislature's lower
house, grabbing him from in front of his mother's house in a Lima
shantytown, police said today.
   Authorities said the two men with pistols who seized Giraldo
Lopez Quiroz, a member of President Alberto Fujimori's party, late
Sunday were probably members of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, one of two major leftist insurgent groups
in Peru.
   The larger and more violent is the Maoist Shining Path.
   Lopez Quiroz belongs to the Change 90 party of Fujimori, a
political outsider who took power July 28 after winning an upset
victory in national elections.
   The kidnappers made no immediate demands. Police said they were
unsure where Lopzez Quiroz's bodyguards were at the time of the
kidnapping.
   Tupac Amaru has carried out political kidnappings in the past,
including the seizure of the head of a private television station.

<HEAD>Critics Hail Rushdie's First Book Since Death Call</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say Salman Rushdie's first book since
Iran's call for his death, a lighthearted fairy tale for children,
also carries a serious message for adults.
   Reviewers marveled Sunday that Rushdie could write with such
mischievous humor, despite 19 months in hiding under police guard.
During that time, he has moved constantly and been separated from
his wife, the American novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Most critics, however, also see signs of pain and desperation in
the prose of ``Haroun and The Sea of Stories.''
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for Rushdie's death
after the author's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' was deemed
blasphemous to Islam.
   The new book tells the tale of a Hindu storyteller whose talent
is suddenly destroyed by a fanatical dictator who poisons the
springs of his inspiration. The storyteller's brave son, Haroun,
eventually defeats the enemy of stories and restores his father's
gift.
   Rushdie dedicates the book to his own son with these lines:
   ``As I wander far from view
   Read, and bring me home to you.''
   British writer Anthony Burgess, reviewing the book in the
Observer newspaper, said the dedication ``renews rage'' at ``the
stupidity of the Islamic deathmongers, burning a book they do not
have the intelligence to understand.''
   Burgess called it a ``great tribute to the resilience of Mr.
Rushdie's beleaguered spirit that he should write so charmingly
funny a book.''
   ``It is a book to enjoy and not to explicate but, if we wish, we
can take it as a piece of Swiftian outrage at human folly disguised
as a children's tale,'' Burgess wrote.
   Rushdie, a British citizen born into a Moslem family in India,
was sentenced to death Feb. 14, 1989. Even after Khomeini's death
last year, the sentence was not lifted by Iranian leaders.
   Rushdie has since published poetry and several essays and
reviews, but ``Haroun and The Sea of Stories'' is his first book
since he went into hiding.
   It will be published by Granta Books in Britain on Sept. 27 and
in the United States next year.
   Graham Lord, literary editor of The Sunday Express, said Rushdie
``has managed during his awful captivity to write a remarkably
lighthearted, almost mischievous children's book.''
   But Lord found ``poignant autobiographical shadows of Rushdie's
own dreadful predicament,'' especially in the remark of one
character who said: ``Happy endings are much rarer in stories, and
also in life, than most people think.''
   ``Coming from Rushdie, in apparently unending captivity, that
sounds like a desperate cry echoing in the dark,'' Lord said.
   David Hughes, in The Mail on Sunday, said: ``Salman Rushdie, the
flags of merriment flying throughout his allegory, wins a grim
fight of his own. ... His fine book, written in conditions in which
such ebullience of mood takes courage, is a great re-echoing cry
for freedom of word and view, for the inarguable truth in a good
story.''
   Writer and critic Marina Warner, reviewing the book in The
Sunday Times, which published several excerpts, said Rushdie's
``jauntiness'' under sentence of death ``is matter for wonder
enough'' but ``what is even more so is the ... absolutely unpompous
treatment of the villains in the story.''

   New rains drenched this flooded
state capital today after its heaviest storm in 90 years.
Authorities said at least 40 people were killed in the inundation
and more than 5,000 forced to flee their homes.
   The Red Cross said another 30 people were missing.
   The storm, which hit Saturday night, dumped more than five
inches of rain in the area around Chihuahua City, about 200 miles
south of El Paso, Texas.
   Authorities feared that the Chihuahua and Chuviscas dams would
overflow. Firefighters, police and army troops were evacuating
neighborhoods near them.
   More than 350 homes were destroyed and 1,000 damaged, said Gov.
Fernando Baeza Melendez. About 60 neighborhoods were without
running water, he said.
   He declared an emergency in the area around the Chihuahua state
capital, a city of about 600,000.
   State government spokesman Jesus Dominguez said 5 percent of the
capital was without electricity.
   Red Cross radio dispatcher Heriberto Perez said water lay in
some places between four and nine feet deep.
   Angel Alvarez Gomez, a weather service forecaster, was quoted by
the government news agency Notimex as saying the storms dumped more
than five inches of water in the area around the capital.
   He called it Chihuahua's heaviest downpour in 90 years.
   Rain was forecast to continue for several days.

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio was hanged in effigy and
depicted in posters as Adolf Hitler as thousands demanded repeal of
a record $2.8 billion tax increase.
   ``We need accountability in government and criminal prosecution
for those who rip us off,'' said John Budzash, a mailman and
founder of the anti-tax group Hands Across New Jersey. ``Do we have
efficient spending in government? No.''
   The governor declined an invitation to the rally at the
Statehouse on Sunday. He instead told supporters in Ewing that
those seeking repeal have not considered the consequences.
   ``Things would not get better, they would get dramatically
worse,'' the Democrat sid. ``We'd have a New Jersey very few
people would want to live in.''
   The $2.8 billion tax hike, the biggest in New Jersey history,
was passed the Democrat-controlled Legislature less than seven
months after Florio took office.
   The package will be used to close a budget gap of more than $1
billion, provide $1.1 billion in new aid to schools and ease
property taxes.
   The income tax will rise for the highest earners. Florio also
raised the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and extended it to
such items as alcohol, cigarettes, telephone bills, soap and toilet
paper.
   In addition to hanging Florio in effigy and selling posters of
him as Hitler, demonstrators sang anti-tax, anti-Florio tunes and
waved placards attacking him.
   State Police Sgt. Peter Hinkle said that the 4{-hour rally
peaked at about 4,000 people. Budzash said at least 10,000
attended. A similar rally July 1 drew about 6,000.
   Budzash said his group is seeking repeal of the increases, the
right to recall the governor and legislators, the right to use
initiative and referendum to make laws, and a more efficient
government.
   Pat Ralston, a leader of Hands Across New Jersey, said the group
would present Florio with at least 800,000 signatures seeking
repeal. She said petitions containing about 250,000 more signatures
may have been stolen.

   Mixed in with the ads for trusses and

   It claims 80 percent accuracy in its weather forecasts, but
editor and part-owner Judson Hale says that figure is not cast in
stone.
   ``I can't in seriousness say 80 percent,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his Dublin office. He missed the Midwest
drought in 1988.
   Nevertheless, the almanac is predicting a ``real old-fashioned
winter'' east of the Rockies with below-normal temperatures over
much of the country except Florida, sections of the Ohio and lower
Mississippi valleys and the Northwest.
   Florida, it predicts, will have warmer than normal weather in
February and March.
   The almanac also forecasts a generally warmer spring and summer
than normal, but a cool and wet fall.
   The almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a
secret formula devised by its founder and the ``most modern
scientific calculation based on solar activity.''
   Hale also strays into earthquake forecasts, noting that the moon
will be 221,545 miles from the Earth on New Year's Eve, closer than
its average of 251,000 miles.
   ``Some people would believe it would have an influence on an
earthquake if an earthquake was thinking about happening,'' he
said. Believers argue that when the moon is closer and its
gravitational pull is stronger, there is greater stress on rock
layers that might rupture and cause a quake.
   The almanac even offers folklore advice on babies. On
conception, the almanac offers this folk wisdom: If a woman lays
her hat or coat on a strange bed, she will have a child.
   To have a boy, she should hold a nickel in her mouth at the time
of conception. To make the baby grow tall, folksters suggest
putting manure in the child's shoes.
   The yellow-covered Old Farmer's Almanac has changed little since
it was first published in 1792.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.
   ``It does indicate it is, in a sense, a calendar,'' Hale says.
   Hale spent the summer scouring previous issues for lore to
include in an expanded 200th anniversary edition next year.
   ``I'm up to 1931,'' he said. ``I have 65 pages of notes.''
   Almanac readers will get a chance to contribute. The essay topic
for the 200th edition: How the Old Farmer's Almanac Has Influenced

   Here is a breakdown of the opposing
forces in the Persian Gulf:
   ---
   IRAQ:
   Baghdad has fifty-five army divisions with an estimated 555,000
regular troops and 480,000 reserves. Regular forces include seven
divisions of elite Republican Guards. Iraq claims a militia called
the Popular Army has 5 million men.
   Baghdad's armory has 5,500 tanks, 3,500 heavy artillery guns;
200 multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; 330 surface-to-air missile launchers; 500-plus combat
airctaft, including Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24
fighter-bombers and advancedMiG-29 interceptors.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divisions, four of them
armored, totaling 170,000 troops, 1,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks and 700
artillery pieces. A further 150,000 men, including the seven
Republican Guard divisions with up to 1,300 tanks and 750 guns, are
dug in in southern Iraq. Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed
to have been deployed to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in
Kuwait.

   The multinational force that is facing Iraq includes:
   
   UNITED STATES: Officials say more than 165,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the gulf region or en route. Deployments
could go as high as 250,000 in the biggest U.S. military operation
since Vietnam.
   Ground forces include the 82nd ``All American'' Airborne
Division, the 101st ``Screaming Eagles'' Airborne Division, the
24th Mechanized Infantry Division, with some 200 M-1 Abrams tanks
and 300 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, the 11th Air Defense Artillery
Brigade, 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade and the 3rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment.
   Amphibious capability is provided by 45,000 men of the 1st, 4th
and 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigades. There is a Special Forces
contingent from the 1st Special Operations Command.
   The U.S. deployment is expected to be complete by late October,
when the Americans will have around 1,000 tanks in Saudi Arabia.
   More than 50 U.S. warships are in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and
the eastern Mediterranean, including the aircraft carriers
Independence, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy. Another seven ships are
expected in the Mediterranean.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter-bombers to
unspecified bases, 14 long-range F-111F bombers to Incirlik
airbase, in southwest Turkey, and another squadron to Spain.
   
   BRITAIN: It has 10 ships in the gulf, including a missile
destroyer, two missile frigates and three minesweepers.
   Three squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors and ground
attack jets are in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. At lease one
more Tornado squadron will arrive soon. Three Nimrod maritime
reconnaisance aircraft are in Oman.
   The British force totals 3,000 personnel, with 2,000 logistics
personnel at a staging post in Cyprus, where the British have
sovereign bases.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, successors to the famous ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, will arrive late next month with 120
Challenger tanks and 6,000 troops.
   
   FRANCE: It has about 14 ships, with an estimated 8,000 men, in
the gulf or en route, including the carrier Clemenceau with 42
combat helicopters, a guided-missile cruiser, two missile
destroyers, two frigates and one corvette. The fleet tanker Var is
also being deployed.
   A company of 190 paratroopers equipped for chemical warfare is
in the United Arab Emirates.
   France is sending three squadrons of interceptors and
fighter-bombers. The first elements of a 4,000-man rapid deployment
force arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. French strength will rise
to 13,000 when the deployment is completed.
   
   SOVIET UNION: It has sent the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral
Tributs and an anti-submarine ship to the Gulf of Oman. Moscow has

<NOTE>Eds: Note contents pertaining to Doe's death.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commanders of Liberia's rival
rebel armies will meet this week for U.S.-brokered talks aimed at
ending their country's 9-month-old civil war, West African
officials have announced.
   At the same time, grisly reports emerged on the torture-slaying
of former Liberian President Samuel Doe, who died earlier this
month in rebel hands.
   A London newspaper quoted witnesses as saying Doe, already
wounded in the legs, was slashed about the face until he bled
profusely, and that his body was later paraded around Liberia's
capital in a wheelbarrow and mutilated.
   A cease-fire has been in place since Saturday in Monrovia, the
capital. More than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the
conflict.
   Rebel leaders Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson will meet Friday
in Freetown, Sierra Leone, for talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Herman Cohen, said officials of the West African Economic
Community. Cohen arranged the talks in meetings with the two rebels
last week, they said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said Taylor
announced a plan to hold elections Oct. 10 when he spoke at a news
conference Sunday in Gbarnga, 75 miles northeast of Monrovia.
   His army invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in December,
accusing Doe of mismanagement and corruption in running the country
founded by freed American slaves in 1847.
   Johnson fought with Taylor's forces early on. But the two men
later had a falling-out, and their forces have been battling one
another as well as Doe loyalists. They both claim the presidency.
   In an account in London's Sunday Observer newspaper, a Lebanese
merchant from Monrovia said he watched Johnson's men torture Doe
after the president was captured during a battle Sept. 9 at the
headquarters of a West African army. The regional force was sent by
the Economic Community nations to restore peace, but it has been
caught up in the fighting.
   ``Doe's hands were cuffed together and he had been shot in both
legs and was bleeding heavily. They were abusing him,'' the
merchant, identified only as Joseph, was quoted as saying.
   ``Then one of Johnson's men took a knife, a machete, and cut off
his ear. Then they cut his face like this,'' he told the newspaper,
indicating diagonal slashes across the cheeks. ``He was crying and
the blood was running down his cheeks from his face and head.''
   The man said Doe at one point blew on the blood that had pooled
on his body, and ``one of Johnson's men thought he was trying to do
some kind of juju (magic), blowing on himself to make himself
disappear.''
   ``So he shot him again,'' the merchant said. ``He was nearly
dead then, anyway, from loss of blood.''
   The Observer also quoted a Liberian teacher, identified only as
Oliver, as saying he saw Doe's body later in the day.
   ``They had him in a wheelbarrow and were pushing the body around
the town. They were shouting, `We've killed Doe,' and firing their
guns in the air.
   ``People were coming up to the body and cutting it with knives.
Slashing at him. He had two fingers, maybe three, missing from one
hand and they had cut off his testicles,'' the teacher said.
   ``Then they took his body to the Island Clinic. For the first
two or three days a lot of people were going to see it, but then
the smell got too bad,'' Oliver said.
   Both witnesses were interviewed in Freetown.
   Their description was reminiscent of an October 1985 scene when
Doe put the mutilated body of Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa on
display in an open car that toured Monrovia. Quiwonkpa has been
captured after an attempt to overthrow Doe.

   When their two children were killed two
years apart in a car crash and a snowmobile accident, Bernie and
Jean Haugen immersed themselves in helping others.
   Haugen, a municipal judge, was a champion of children and
children's rights, friends and neighbors say. He supervised the
Richland County juvenile court, taught Sunday school and served as
a Boy Scout leader.
   Mrs. Haugen, an instructor in occupational therapy at North
Dakota State College of Science, became active in a support group
for parents grieving the loss of a child. The couple also enlisted
as foster parents to troubled adolescents.
   In mid-June, they were driving home from Minneapolis, where they
had taken a runaway to catch a flight to Washington, when their car
slammed into a bridge.
   Mrs. Haugen was killed. Her husband of 30 years died Aug. 14
from his injuries.
   The Haugens - parents and children - now lie buried a few yards
from their home in Wahpeton, near the Minnesota line.
   Residents wonder at how so much sadness could strike one family.
   ``It's incredible, absolutely incredible,'' said the Rev. Marv
L. Hartmann of Bethel Lutheran Church, which the family attended
for 20 years. ``Then and now, the whole community is just sick at
heart.''
   ``The whole community has really been working together on
this,'' said Chuck Sheeley, who was a close friend of Haugen's.
``It is tragic. Nobody can understand this because there's no
reason for it.''
   The couple's son, Donnell, was killed with a friend in an
automobile accident near Otter Tail Lake, Minn., in 1981, the night
before they were to graduate with honors from Wahpeton High School.
   Their daughter, Kimberlee, died of head injuries in a snowmobile
accident near Brainerd, Minn., two years later. She was a passenger
on the snowmobile and was just three months short of graduating
from high school.
   Those who knew the teen-agers remember them as good students,
active in sports and other school activities.
   ``They were excited, enthusiastic about everything,'' Hartmann
said.
   Donnell was an Eagle Scout and a school record-holder in the
3,200-meter run. Kimberlee was a gifted musician and active in
youth activities at the church.
   She won first place in a contest for writing about the person
she admired most in the community - her father. She described his
work with young people and the church, calling him a man willing to
fight for his convictions.
   ``He was an advocate of abused, deprived and neglected kids,''
said Sheeley, the county probation officer. ``Those were the kind
of kids that bothered him the most.''
   ``It was almost a lifestyle for Bernie, not a job,'' Hartmann
added.
   Haugen suffered severe internal injuries and broken bones in the
crash and later developed pneumonia. He was 51.
   ``It's difficult accepting this,'' Sheeley said. ``But (Bernie)
always told me that life isn't fair. I guess he was right. We're
all going to miss him very much.''

   Charles H. Keating Jr. isn't allowed to eat,
exercise or otherwise mingle with other inmates at the Los Angeles
County Jail.
   Keating, blamed by regulators for the nation's biggest savings
and loan failure, spends his days alone in a cell at the cavernous
Men's Central Jail. With nearly 7,000 prisoners, the jail is one of
the nation's largest.
   ``We do it because of his newsworthiness. Because of who he
is,'' said sheriff's Deputy Bill Linnemeyer. ``We do the same with
all personalities for their well-being and safety.''
   But that's where Keating's special treatment ends.
   For him and other inmates, the day begins at 5:30 a.m. when
lights in the jail are turned on. It ends at 10 p.m. when the
lights are turned off.
   Keating, 66, is given one hour a day to exercise, watch
television or use the phone. Like all prisoners, he's served three
meals a day.
   Linnemeyer said Keating has no better accommodations than other
inmates. His cell has a bunk with a mattress and blanket, a toilet
and sink.
   ``It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's comfortable,'' Linnemeyer
said.
   Keating was indicted last week on charges he swindled elderly
investors in now-worthless junk bonds sold through his collapsed
Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set bail at $5 million and
refused on Friday to reduce it to $500,000. The judge said Keating
has ``significant reasons not to stay around'' while awaiting
trial.
   Keating could get up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

   Voters returned former Rep. Patsy Mink to the
U.S. House for the rest of the year and also nominated the Democrat
for a full two-year term.
   Democrat Daniel Akaka, who was appointed temporarily to fill
Sen. Spark's Matsunaga's seat after he died of cancer in April, was
nominated Saturday to serve out the rest of Matsunaga's term. Rep.
Patricia Saiki won the Republican nomination.
   Gov. John Waihee, seeking his second four-year term, coasted
past three little-known opponents in the Democratic primary. He
will face GOP state Rep. Fred Hemmings, a businessman and former
world champion surfer, who beat five others in the Republican
primary.
   Mink beat seven other candidates in a winner-take-all special
election to fill the three months remaining in Akaka's term. Akaka
resigned his House seat in May to succeed Matsunaga.
   Mink edged business executive Mufi Hannemann in the special
election, and also beat Hannemann in the Democratic primary. She
will face Republican Andrew Poepoe in the Nov. 6 general election.
   Mink, 62, an attorney, served in the House from 1965 to 1977 and
was a member of the Honolulu City Council from 1982 to 1986.
   In another U.S. House race, Matsunaga's son, Honolulu attorney
Matthew Matsunaga, came in third in a Democratic primary.

   Citizens in 83 countries lighted candles, tolled
bells and chanted prayers in an appeal to world leaders to help
save the 40,000 children who die each day from disease, crime,
hunger and war.
   The 2,600 sundown vigils around the globe Sunday came less than
a week before more than 70 heads of state meet for the U.N. World
Summit for Children. The summit aims to reduce death and suffering
among children.
   The vigils followed sunset around the globe, starting with
scientists in Antarctica and continuing at refugee camps on the
Somalian-Ethiopian border and at 200 Buddhist temples in South
Korea.
   More than 300 people rallied in front of the United Nations,
where the summit convenes on Saturday.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who attended the vigil, criticized
President Bush for not acting on a U.N. treaty that guarantees
basic health, education and human rights to the world's children.
   ``There is no excuse for Bush not to have signed this,'' said
Bradley, who sponsored a resolution asking the president to forward
the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Bradley said his
resolution passed the Senate by a unanimous voice vote Sept. 11.
   The U.N. Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly last year. To be ratified by the United
States, the treaty must pass the Senate, then be signed by Bush.
   More than 500 candlelight vigils took place in the United
States.
   In St. Paul, Minn., about 1,500 people, including many
pre-schoolers, gathered on the steps of the state Capitol. They
listened to speeches, music and a reading of Dr. Seuss' ``Horton
Hatches the Egg.''
   In San Francisco, state Superintendent of Public Instruction
Bill Honig told a crowd of about 150 at City Hall he found it
``sickening ... that this society, with the riches that we have,
can't figure out a way to allow our youngsters to grow up in more
decent conditions.''
   In New York, the crowd listened to speeches, folk songs and
prayers and stood for a moment of silence. n a corner of the
plaza, six children knelt around candles and flowers.
   ``I'm here because there is starvation and death, because they
don't have enough food and they're sick. We have to send food and
medicines - and love,'' said Ryan DeVeaux, 10.
   The number of child deaths due to disease could be cut in half
by the year 2000 with the help of $2.5 billion - the amount of
money spent in a year on cigarette advertising in the United
States, said Barbara Charbonnet, coordinator of the New York vigil.

<HEAD>Contractor Claims Obesity Should Qualify Him For City Housing Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A contractor says his weight - 640 pounds -
should qualify him as a minority when it comes to bidding on city
contracts.
   Donald E. Keister, 30, has threatened a lawsuit unless Baltimore
recognizes him as a minority. Minorities are given preferential
treatment in the awarding of housing rehabilitation contracts.
   ``The city won't even let me apply for minority certification
because I am not black or another racial minority,'' said Keister,
who has been diagnosed as suffering from morbid obesity.
   City officials say the minority preference law was intended to
help women and members of races who have suffered discrimination -
not fat people.
   Because of his weight, Keister said he cannot go to job sites
and must manage employees from his office, which has special chairs
and equipment to sustain his weight.
   ``I went to houses years ago and would fall right through the
wooden steps because they couldn't support my weight,'' he said.
``It costs me a lot more money to run my business because of my
condition. ... I'm fortunate to have real good people working for
me.''
   He said he qualifies as a minority under a new federal law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and has been certified as a
minority by several counties, a state council and the state
Transportion Department.
   Keister, who has six employees, specializes in lead-paint
testing and removal and also does general contracting and
consulting.
   Under a city program, 15 percent to 25 percent of the work on
contracts is set aside for businesses owned by racial minorities
and women.
   Clint Coleman, a spokesman for Mayor Kurt Schmoke, said the law
doesn't include handicapped people. The ordinance is under review
to bring it into conformance with recent court rulings, he said.

<TEXT>
   A pair of tourists decided not to just walk
on by at the sight of so many homeless and hungry people.
   Dennis Seifert, 38, Newport Beach, and Howard Hawley, 38, of
Corona, invited about 70 street people to lunch Sunday.
   At first, only 10 street people accepted. But word spread
quickly and soon dozens lined up at the counter of a Carl's Jr.
fast-food restaurant.
   The manager, who would not identify himself, at first encouraged
the homeless to eat outside, saying he was worried that fleas and
ticks from them would infest the salad bar. But Seifert insisted
that they eat indoors.
   One man, who gave his name only as Jack, finished three
hamburgers and took one to go.
   ``Anytime you get to eat free hamburgers, man, it's like winning
the lottery,'' he said, patting his stomach.
   The tab for lunch came to $96.81, but Hawley said the experience
was worth much more.
   ``You walk around and see so many homeless people, it gets to
you,'' he said. ``We can't feed everyone, but if we can make a
small dent in the problem, well, maybe that is a contribution.''

Temperatures were expected to fall along the East Coast, dipping
into the 50s in much of the Northeast and into the 60s as far south
as the Carolinas.
   Sunday, Florida enjoyed unseasonably warm weather, with highs in
the 90s. Records for the date were broken from Ft. Lauderdale to
Miami Beach to Orlando. Temperatures were expected to fall by as

   The dollar fell against all major foreign
currencies today in quiet, early European trading. Gold prices were
mixed.
   Dealers said the dollar was weaker after the Group of Seven
weekend meeting in Washington which showed that the seven
industrial nation's central bankers and finance ministers were
satisfied with current foreign exchange levels.
   The communique after the meeting called for continued firm
monetary policies in the face of high oil prices, but expressed
satisfaction with recent major currency moves on foreign exchanges.
   ``The dollar will continue to fall. The statement showed nobody
is too dissatisfied with this,'' said Jeff Earnshaw, deputy head of
trading at Natwest Moneycenter in London.
   Dealers said trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for
a national holiday and ahead of Tuesday's release of the third and
final report on U.S. second quarter gross national product data.
   Tokyo markets were closed today for Autumnal Equinox Day. In
London, the dollar fell to 135.57 yen from Friday's Tokyo close of
137.33 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   -1.5675 German marks, down from 1.5770
   -1.3055 Swiss francs, down from 1.3205
   -5.2482 French francs, down from 5.2790
   -1.7745 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7773
   -1,169.75 Italian lire, down from 1,175.75
   -1.1510 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1528
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8625, compared
with $1.8465 late Friday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$390.15 per ounce at midmorning, from $388.25 bid per ounce late
Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $390.40, down from $392.20 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.05 to close at a bid
$389.42.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.80 a troy ounce,
from Friday's $4.81.

<HEAD>Winnie Mandela Arraigned in Fatal Beating Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela, looking grim
and tired, was arraigned today on charges of assault and kidnapping
stemming from a 1988 incident when four youths were allegedly taken
to her house and beaten.
   Mrs. Mandela, holding hands with her husband, African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela, said nothing as she arrived at a
city magistrate's court. She stood silently in the courtroom as her
lawyers conferred with the magistrate and a trial date was set for
Feb. 4.
   Mrs. Mandela, wearing a black outfit, was greeted by about 30
cheering and singing ANC women supporters as she left the court.
``Winnie, Winnie!'' the women chanted as they tried to touch Mrs.
Mandela.
   She smiled briefly before being whisked away by lawyers and
aides.
   One youth was killed and the former head of Mrs. Mandela's
bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, has been convicted of murder and
sentenced to death in the same case. The sentence is being
appealed.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any wrongdoing.
   White and black leaders fear the trial will strain relations
between the ANC, the leading anti-apartheid group, and the
white-led government as they try to start talks on extending
political rights to the black majority.
   Mandela may be discredited in the eyes of militant young blacks
who oppose negotiating with the government and will see his wife's
trial as demeaning.
   Mrs. Mandela faces trial with seven members of her former
bodyguard who have been charged on the same counts. Court officials
say she faces four charges of kidnapping and four of assault with
intent to commit grievous bodily harm.
   Mrs. Mandela was freed on her own recognizance. Bail for the
other defendants was continued. All eight will be tried together.
   If convicted, Mrs. Mandela could face the death sentence,
lawyers said. However, that sentence has never been imposed for
kidnapping, they said.
   Mrs. Mandela has been plunged into a series of damaging public
exposures, mainly linked to the actions of her bodyguards, called
the Mandela United Football Club. The group, which had little to do
with soccer, was composed of about two dozen aggressive teen-agers.
   In December 1988, four young blacks were kidnapped from a church
home in Soweto, according to testimony at Richardson's trial. The
four were taken to Mrs. Mandela's Soweto home and assaulted,
witnesses said.
   Stompie Seipei, 14, was killed. The three survivors testified
that Mrs. Mandela participated in the beatings.
   According to testimony, Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards accused Seipei
of being a police informer and the three others of having
homosexual relations with the white minister who ran the church
home where they lived.
   No evidence has been presented that Seipei was a police spy. The
youth was a well-known anti-apartheid activist.
   The Methodist Church cleared the minister of any misconduct.
   In other developments, police said today at least 12 people died
nationwide in new black factional fighting over the weekend.
   About 800 people have been killed in such violence in the
Johannesburg area since August.
   The fighting pits Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC
against Zulus linked to the conservative Inkatha movement. The two
groups oppose apartheid but differ over leadership and aims for a
future South Africa.

   The release Tuesday of Stevie Ray Vaughan's
``Family Style'' album will be bittersweet for fans and family of
the late blues guitarist.
   Vaughan and his brother, Jimmie, worked together on the album,
their most extensive collaboration.
   ``It was something they always wanted to do,'' said Charles
Comer, the brothers' publicist and a longtime family friend.
   Stevie Ray Vaughan, a Dallas native, died Aug. 27 in a
helicopter crash in Wisconsin following a concert with Eric
Clapton.
   It was not the first time the brothers recorded together. Jimmie
joined his brother's band for two tracks on ``Couldn' Stand the

``Under the Red Sky.''

<TEXT>
   ``I knew what I was getting into when
I joined the navy three years ago, but naturally I'm nervous,''
said sailor Lill Mortensen the day she shipped out for the Persian
Gulf.
   Ms. Mortensen, 24, is one of 10 female sailors in the 100-person
crew aboard the corvette Olfert Fischer, sent to Middle East waters
to help enforce a U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq.
   Norway, Belgium, Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands are the
only countries that assign women to offensive combat positions in
their armed forces. For the five NATO members, the gulf crisis
could provide the first test of that policy.
   ``Of course it's hard on the family to have to say goodbye,''
said Ms. Mortensen. ``And luckily my boyfriend and I are used to
being separated. He's a submariner.''
   In addition to the 10 Danes, there are 24 women on board a Dutch
frigate that sailed for the gulf last month, and 30 on the
destroyer Protecteur, which Canada sent to join the international
armada.
   American women, though they make up 10 percent of the military's
personnel, are restricted to non-combat roles.
   Danish laws enacted in the 1960s mandated sexual equality in the
labor market and opened the way for women in the military. But it
wasn't until 1988 that women were allowed to train for combat and
join fighting units.
   Air force Capt. Sussie Rasmussen calls sexual harassment or
discrimination in the military ``no worse than one finds in other
work places where women are introduced for the first time.''
   Only two all-male bastions remain in Denmark's military - the
cockpit of a jet fighter and aboard a submarine.
   In Norway, women are assigned to submarines. There are Dutch
female fighter pilots, and there are no restrictions on Belgian
women's combat positions.
   Ms. Rasmussen calls the U.S. restrictions on women odd.
   ``I find it a paradox that U.S. women sail on navy supply and
ammunition ships and fly on AWACS reconnaissance planes - all
obvious enemy targets in an armed conflict - and yet are kept
behind the battle lines,'' she said.
   ``When it comes to a `your life or mine' situation, the female
survival instinct is just as strong as the male's.''
   Norwegian women have had equal rights and duties with men in the
armed forces since 1985. But women are exempt from the draft.
   ``Once they have volunteered, they have exactly the same duties
as men. If they are in a combat unit, they would go with it
anywhere,'' said Col. Per Boethun of the Norwegian Supreme Defense
Command.
   Boethun said Norway has women infantry, sailors and pilots. They
fly military transports and would be allowed to fly fighters even
in battle, said Boethun. None, however, has qualified as a fighter
pilot.
   Norwegian air force Maj. Berit Ovesen said some leaders hinder
women from promotions or more training. ``Also, some leaders think
it doesn't pay to train women who are of childbearing age,'' she
said.
   In the Netherlands, women make up about 2 percent of the
120,000-member military, and serve mostly in logistics and
operations.
   Some are in combat units and ``if it comes down to fighting,
they will have to fight like men,'' said Dutch army spokesman Wiebe
Alkema.
   A Belgian defense official said his country's 3,000 women
volunteers have equal rights to any position or rank, but few seek
combat jobs.
   A Canadian human rights tribunal ruled in 1989 that all armed
forces units, except submarine crews, must be open to women. They
now account for about 10 percent of the 87,000-member armed forces.
   ``There has been at least one graduate from infantry training,
several from artillery. They have armored people going through
training now,'' said Capt. Ric Jones, a Department of National
Defense spokesman.
   Asked whether women would be yanked out of combat in a shooting
war, Jones said: ``I can't answer that question, but I don't expect
so because when we employ a person, we employ them. They are
treated as equals, not specials.''

   Nikita Khrushchev paid tribute to Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg for providing information that significantly helped
the Soviets develop an atomic bomb.
   The ousted Soviet leader also said a ``hotheaded'' Fidel Castro
wanted the Soviet Union to attack the United States during the
Cuban missile crisis and Josef Stalin made a secret attempt to
negotiate peace with Adolf Hitler during World War II.
   Khrushchev remarks are contained in tapes he made during seven
years of house arrest before his death in 1971. The tapes were
acquired by Time magazine, and excerpts were published in the Oct.
1 issue.
   ``I was part of Stalin's circle when he mentioned the Rosenbergs
with warmth,'' said Khrushchev, who was ousted in 1964.
   ``I cannot specifically say what kind of help they gave us, but
I heard from both Stalin and (Vyacheslav) Molotov, then minister of
foreign affairs, that the Rosenbergs provided very significant help
in accelerating the production of our atom bomb,'' he said. ``Let
this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people.''
   The Rosenbergs' son Robert Meeropol, who has worked for years
with his brother, Michael, to clear their parents' name, called
Khrushchev's remarks ``wholly absurd.''
   ``The U.S. government acknowledged that none of the material
discussed at the trial was of any value,'' said Meeropol, a
43-year-old lawyer in Springfield, Mass., who was 6 when his
parents were executed in 1953 as spies.
   Krushchev said Castro, during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
``suggested that to prevent our nuclear missiles from being
destroyed, we should launch a pre-emptive strike against the U.S.''
   ``My comrades in the leadership and I realized that our friend
Fidel totally failed to understand our purpose. We had installed
the missiles not for the purpose of attacking the U.S. but to keep
the U.S. from attacking Cuba,'' he said.
   Khrushchev said a desperate Josef Stalin made a ``very secret''
overture of peace to Adolf Hitler during World War II. Stalin
wanted to reach an agreement with Hitler to let Germany keep
territory they occupied in the Ukraine, Byelorussia and certain
areas of the Russian federation, Krushchev said.
   ``I think it was in 1942,'' he said. ``There was never any
answer from Hitler.''
   Many of the tapes Khrushchev made after his ouster were smuggled
to the West and two volumes of memoirs were published in the 1970s.
His friends and relatives withheld some of the tapes, fearing he
had been too candid.
   Last year, Time magazine acquired those tapes. Another book,
``Khrushchev Remembers: The Glasnost Tapes,'' is due out next month
from Little, Brown.

   In their most bellicose statement yet, Iraq's leaders have
warned the U.S.-led forces arrayed against them that they would
launch an all-out war before allowing the U.N. trade embargo to
``strangle'' the Iraqi people.
   They seemed for the first time to be threatening a first strike,
and mentioned Israel and Mideast oil fields as potential targets.
   ``America must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire
region ... in fact, even the whole world ... to the brink of a
bottomless abyss, from which the region will never see light for
dozens of years,'' the Iraqi communique said Sunday.
   It was signed by the Revolution Command Council and the ruling
Baath Party but bore the rhetorical imprint of President Saddam
Hussein - studded with references to ``poisonous wasps,''
``evil-doers'' and ``Zionist usurpers.''
   ``We will never allow anybody, whomever he may be, to strangle
the people of Iraq without having himself strangled,'' the
communique said.
   Last year, Iraq imported 75 percent of the food its people
consumed. Now, an international trade embargo ordered by the U.N.
Security Council in response to Saddam's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait
has prompted the Baghdad government to begin rationing some
staples.
   The Security Council is expected to vote Tuesday on an eighth
resolution punishing Iraq for refusing to relinquish Kuwait. The
strictest yet, it would block all air traffic in and out of Iraq
but planes carrying humanitarian aid.
   The prospect of being even further cut off and ostracized likely
contributed to the Iraqi communique's acid tone:
   ``Those who wish the flood to overtake the Iraqi people and the
nation, and are planning for this, should remember well that the
waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the
Iraqi people.''
   Iraq further consolidated its hold on Kuwait today by declaring
the country's currency, the dinar, invalid and withdrawn from
circulation. The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq would
reimburse holders of the currency with Iraqi dinars.
   At the same time, however, Iraq held out a small olive branch to
France.
   It offered a belated apology on Sunday for the Sept. 14 raid on
the French ambassador's residence in occupied Kuwait during which
the military attache and three other French citizens were arrested.
   French Interior Minister Pierre Joxe today brushed aside
Baghdad's apology for the raid. ``Excuses are fine,'' he said on
French radio. ``but we're waiting for Iraq to let captive Frenchmen
leave in a normal manner.''
   The Foreign Ministry estimates 360 French citizens are held
hostage in Iraq and occupied Kuwait, along with about 1,000
Americans and several thousand other Westerners.
   France responded to the raid by expelling Iraqis from France and
sending 4,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia as part of the U.S.-led
multinational force.
   The troops began arriving on Sunday, and their country's
president, Francois Mitterrand, was to address the opening session
of the 45th U.N. General Assembly today.
   Iraq is expected to face a chorus of condemnation in three weeks
of speeches by leaders to the world body, which has gained a new
vitality in its near-unanimous response to the crisis.
   But there may be no Iraqis present.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, said Sunday that Iraq would
not participate in the session because the State Department had
refused to allow Iraqi Airways to fly Aziz and his entourage to New
York.
   A State Department official said the matter was still being
considered, ``but it would seem inappropriate to grant permission
for the Iraqi foreign minister to fly his plane to the United
States while hundreds of Americans citizens are being held against
their will in Iraq and Kuwait.''
   A plane carrying 112 evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait landed in
Raleigh, N.C., Sunday night from London. The State Department said
it was the last U.S.-chartered airlift planned from Iraq, which is
holding foreign males as human shields at strategic installations
to discourage a possible attack.
   The Iraqi communique appeared to rule out even the suggestion of
compromise, calling the invasion of Kuwait a ``defensive move''
necessary to achieve Baghdad's ``well-known noble objectives.''
   It warned that ``dire consequences'' would befall
``back-stabbers,'' an apparent reference to the Arab nations that
oppose Saddam. Syria has committed 20,000 troops to the force
standing up to Iraq. Egypt has promised 15,000.
   Three Egyptian navy ships carrying new troops and gear to Saudi
Arabia passed through the Suez Canal on Sunday.
   The Iraqi communique, broadcast by state-run media, threatened
to ``render incapable ... the oil area in Saudi Arabia and in other
states of the region.'' It said ``the oil, the areas it is in and
Israel will be transformed into something different from what they
are now.''
   The communique said Saddam's Aug. 12 statement that he would
only quit Kuwait if Israel turns the occupied territories over to
the Palestinians, was the only basis for negotiations.
   In so saying, it appeared to chide Jordan's King Hussein for
trying to broker an Arab-sponsored peace.
   ``As for the Arabs who are launching good offices,'' the
communique said, ``they are urged not to replace the solution that
we offered on Aug. 12 with a partial solution.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, interviewed on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press,'' was asked about the possibility of war.
   ``We have said many times we hoped there won't be,'' he replied,
but added President Bush was not ruling out any options.
   In another gulf-related developments, South Korea said today
that it would donate $220 million in military and humanitarian aid
to multinational defense efforts in the gulf.
   The amount falls short of the reported $450 million originally
requested by the United States. South Korea said recent major
floods have left it strapped for cash.

<HEAD>Leader of Bulgaria's Governing Party Steps Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the governing Socialist
Party, a member of the Politburo under the ousted Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov, stepped down today under fire from reformers.
   His announcement came on the third day of a turbulent congress
to determine the future of the party that shed its Communist
appellation last spring and went on to win multiparty elections.
   The resigning party leader, Alexander Lilov, had taken over in
February as Bulgaria was swept by the wave of reform that toppled
hard-line Communist regimes across Eastern Europe.
   Lilov has disappointed many party members and other Bulgarians
who expected him to spearhead swift political change.
   Political tensions have been exacerbated by an unprecedented
food shortage in the Balkan nation and the Socialists' popularity
is dwindling. Many store shelves are empty, essential foodstuffs
are rationed, and electricity is periodically cut off.
   In a speech today to the party congress, Lilov acknowledged he
had been burdened by his ties to Bulgaria's past. He said he was
resigning in favor of a ``more pragmatic '' leader.
   ``We are still not a new party which thinks, analizes and acts
from a new position,'' Lilov told delegates. ``Perhaps we are tired
after holding power for over 45 years.''
   While warning against any drastic purge, he called for a new and
united party turning into a ``strong political organization'' with
a rejuvenated leadership.
   ``I have (to assume) the responsibility for the time during
which I was a Politburo member of this party. This has been for
more than ten years,'' he said.
   Lilov and former President Petar Mladenov are among the top
officials who held leading posts during Zhivkov's lengthy rule.
   But Lilov, for many years chief ideologist of the Communist
Party, was dropped from the leadership in 1983. He joined it again
only after Zhivkov's ouster in November.
   Lilov's resignation came a day after Premier Andrei Lukanov
named four possible candidates to replace him.
   In heated debate at the congress, heads of four reform factions
called for a new, younger leadership. The vote could come late
today or Tuesday.
   Dragan Draganov, a leader of the Radical Change faction, summed
up the sentiment of the progressives in a briefing with reporters:
``If no radical changes are made, there will be a gradual
disintegration of the party.''
   The other candidates for party leader named by the premier are
Alexander Tomov, Petar Emil Mitev, and Asen Zhablensky. All are
considered to be reformers.
   Lukanov, the premier, told the congress it should adopt decisive
changes. ``The supporters of the party expect a new face, and it
would be fatal if we did not accede to this demand,'' he said.
   Lukanov, who is also a member of the party's top-level
presidium, is by far the most popular political leader in Bulgaria.
   The country's chief of state is President Zhelyu Zhelev, the
former leader of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces.
   In his remarks to the party congress, Mitev, a university
professor and sociologist, said ``a main reason for the situation
in which the party finds itself now is a lack of political
initiative after the elections.''
   In Bulgaria's free elections in June, the former Communists won
an absolute majority of 211 of the 400 seats in Parliament.
   ``There will be no diesel, no coal ... there won't even be
enough bread in several months,'' Mitev warned.

<HEAD>Church Installs Famed Artist's `Crowning' Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A huge mosaic of iridescent Tiffany glass
worth millions of dollars and considered by the late American
artist to be his crowning achievement will be featured in a new
church here.
   Lake Merritt United Methodist Church is constructing its new
building around the glittering mosaic, valued in the millions of
dollars but donated by another church.
   The mosaic consists of three 8-by-17-foot panels in the Art
Nouveau style, in which Louis Comfort Tiffany crafted his renowned
lamp shades and stained-glass windows. Entitled ``Te Deum
Laudamus,'' the work depicts crowds adoring Jesus Christ shining
above them on a throne.
   Before he died in 1933, Tiffany was quoted as saying the panels
he created 10 years earlier were his ``crowning achievement,'' and
critics have hailed the mosaic as his masterpiece.
   ``(It's) an important art addition to the Bay area,'' said Don
Stover, curator of the M.H. de Young Museum in San Francisco.
Stover, who arranged an 1981 exhibit of Tiffany's work, said the
mosaic was probably the only one by the artist in Northern
California.
   ``I think it's a real coup for Oakland,'' said the Rev. Donald
Kuhn, pastor of the Lake Merritt church. His congregation was given
the work by the First United Methodist Church in Los Angeles.
   The three one-ton panels were made for the Los Angeles church by
Tiffany Studios of New York in 1923 at a cost of $130,000. They
dominated First United's choir loft until 1983, when shrinking
membership forced the church's board to sell the building.
   The board kept the panels in storage until this year, when it
decided to give them to Lake Merritt. Selling them was never
considered.
   ``We preferred they go into another church. ... It's a way of
preserving them, and we're hoping this way others will be blessed
by them, said Grace Keehler, 88, a First United board member who
belonged to the church when the panels were installed.
   The mosaic's worldly value is unknown, but Kuhn guesses it at
``millions of dollars.''
   A single Tiffany lamp shade sold for for $550,000 last year,
said Patrick Meehan, an executive with Christie's Fine Art
Auctioneers in New York.

   Nineteen molotov cocktails were found on the
rooftop of one of two Korean-owned grocery stores that have been
the target of an eight-month black-led boycott, police said.
   The crude hand grenades, bottles filled with flammable liquid,
were found at 8 p.m. Saturday by police officers patrolling the Red
Apple building in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Sgt. Tina
Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman, said Sunday.
   When asked if the bottles posed any immediate threat, Mohrmann
said, ``I believe they would have to be lit. They were just there
on the roof.''
   They were removed by the bomb squad.
   About 50 protesters held a demonstration in front of the stores
Saturday. Authorities said protesters had been gone from the area
for 45 minutes when the devices were discovered.
   The boycott began after a black woman was allegedly assaulted by
a Korean employee inside the Red Apple.
   The protest has nearly put the Red Apple and Church Fruits,
across the street, out of business. On Friday, Mayor David Dinkins
bought some fruits and vegetables at the stores and the owners said
business picked up over the weekend.
   Last week, a detail of 400 officers was assigned to the stores
after an appeals court ruled that police had to enforce a prior
court order to keep protesters 50 feet from the groceries.

   Iraq today declared the Kuwaiti currency,
the dinar, invalid and withdrawn from circulation. It said it would
reimburse holders of the currency with Iraqi dinars.
   Iraq will reimburse those who possess Kuwaiti dinars with the
Iraqi currency on a one-for-one basis, the official Iraqi News
Agency said.
   The Iraqi currency is not convertible on international markets.
   The exchange of currency will be carried out until Oct. 6, after
which the Kuwaiti dinar will be considered illegal tender, the
Iraqi agency quoted the government's Economics Committee as saying.
   Iraq has methodically dismantled Kuwaiti institutions following
its Aug. 2. seizure and subsequent annexation of the neighboring
oil-rich emirate.
   Baghdad authorities have officially disbanded Kuwait's
government, military, foreign embassies and national airline.
   They refer to Kuwait as Iraq's 19th province, but the United
Nations recognizes Kuwait's deposed al-Sabah family as the
country's rulers.
   The al-Sabahs have set up a government-in-exile in Saudi Arabia
and still control billions of dollars in assets worldwide.
   The Iraqi dinar's official value remains the same, but its value
for those who use it on the black market is about a tenth of the
official rate. Iraq punishes currency smugglers with death.
   The fall of Kuwait made instant paupers out of tens of thousands
of people with assets in Kuwait or Kuwaiti currency.
   Kuwait's dinar is no longer convertible outside Iraq and Kuwait,
except in certain very limited circumstances. Kuwaitis stranded in
London, for example, can go to the National Bank of Kuwait or
United Bank of Kuwait and receive pounds if they have dinar
accounts there and can prove a desperate need.
   Before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered his army into
Kuwait, one Iraqi dinar was worth $3.22 at the official rate, and
one Kuwaiti dinar traded at $3.45.

<TEXT>
   East Germany, once the front-line state in
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, formally withdrew from the alliance
today as it prepared for unity with West Germany and membership in
NATO.
   With 10 days remaining before the merger, a protocol on the
pullout of East German troops from the Warsaw Pact was signed in
East Berlin by Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann and the Warsaw
Pact commander-in-chief, Soviet Gen. Piotr Lushev, the official
news agency ADN said.
   The two Germanys will unite Oct. 3 and the new country will be a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The Soviet Union lifted its objections to NATO membership for a
united Germany in July, clearing a major obstacle to unification.
   East Germany and seven other Soviet-bloc nations founded the
Warsaw Pact in May 1955 to counter NATO. But the alliance has
crumbled with the fall of the Berlin Wall and revolutions that
swept away Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe.
   East Germany was the Soviet Union's most important ally in the
Warsaw Pact, and about 360,000 Soviet troops were stationed in East
Germany. The Soviet troops will withdraw over the next four years.
   Top Soviet strategists have said Moscow would like the Warsaw
Pact to evolve into a political alliance.
   Discord within the alliance has been increasing as its members
seek to forge their own defense policies.
   Albania left the alliance after the 1968 invasion of
Czechoslovakia, led by Moscow to halt the ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   East German troops took part in the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
The East German parliament apologized to the Czechoslovak people
after the fall of East Germany's Communist government last fall.

   A 12-year-old girl was killed as she played in
the courtyard of a housing project, the third child to be hit by
random gunfire in the city in three days.
   Mayor David Dinkins said he was ``grief-stricken and outraged''
by the death of Laykama Taylor, and he called for a renewed
commitment to gun control. Laykama, who had just started junior
high school, was shot in the back Sunday afternoon near her
apartment in Brooklyn.
   A 15-year-old girl was hit by a stray ullet and wounded in
Brooklyn earlier Sunday and a 12-year-old girl was shot in the
chest on Friday while playing in a Harlem playground.
   The 15-year-old, Salima Brown, said that shooting at people is
``how they have fun'' in her neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant.
``Usually they just shoot to make you run and they start
laughing,'' Ms. Brown told the Daily News.
   She was shot in the left thigh while walking with her boyfriend.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited the 12-year-old girl, Terez
Williams, at Harlem Hospital on Sunday. Jackson had just come from
delivering a sermon at Riverside Church in Manhattan.
   He told reporters that the people of the city - and not the
mayor - are to blame for violent crime.
   ``The people must make a judgment to stop killing each other, to
stop selling and taking dope,'' Jackson said. ``All the mayor can
do is make moral appeals and make available as much security as the
budget allows.''
   Seven children have been shot and killed by random bullets
between Jan. 1 and Aug. 30, according to Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a
police spokeswoman.

   A veteran stunt pilot died when his
plane crashed during a corkscrew turn in front of more than 15,000
people at an air show.
   Jack Buford Poage, 62, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital
after Sunday's accident in this Baltimore suburb. Poage had been a
co-manager of the Carroll County Airport northwest of Baltimore.
   Poage, a veteran stunt flier, was participating in an air show
at the Martin State Airport that drew an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
people.
   He had been expected to take his single-engine biplane through
three corkscrew turns during a nosedive from about 1,500 feet. For
an unknown reason, Poage added a fourth turn to the maneuver. The
plane belly-landed in a grassy section of the airport next to the
main runway.
   ``About another 20 or 30 feet of altitude, and he would have
been okay,'' said Bob Cadwalader, an airline transport pilot from
Baltimore who witnessed the accident.
   Carol Riley, a spokeswoman for the airport, said the accident
forced officials to cancel the remaining 11 acts of the air show.
   Chuck Jackson, a state police spokesman, said that state police,
the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation
Safety Board were trying to determine the cause of the crash.

<HEAD>Sources: Expelled Diplomats Suspected Of Oil Company Break-in</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A break-in at Saudi Arabia's
biggest oil company two weeks ago is believed to be part of an
alleged effort by Jordanian and Yemeni diplomats to gather
information about strategic Saudi installations for Iraq,
diplomatic sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
break-in was one of numerous suspicious activities that led the
Saudi government to demand Saturday that Iraq, Jordan and Yemen
recall most of their envoys to Riyadh.
   Officials at the oil company, Saudi Aramco, confirmed that two
weeks ago there was an incident in which a fence surrounding oil
tanks was cut. Aramco officials refused to immediately provide any
further details.
   The diplomatic sources said the perpetrators were spotted by a
security sentry after cutting through an outside fence and did not
get through an additional inside barrier.
   ``They were spotted and they ran away,'' said one of the
sources.
   A diplomatic source said the incident coincided with a period in
which Yemeni and Jordanian diplomats were monitored traveling in
the Eastern Province area that is home to Aramco and most of the
troops deployed here to defend Saudi Arabia.
   Another source said several Yemenis with diplomatic privileges
were stopped in the area and questioned by local authorities
several days after the fence was cut. The source refused to discuss
this aspect further.
   The sources said they were reluctant to discuss the Aramco
incident because they did not want to raise fears among the
company's expatriate workers. Most workers sent their families home
after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait several weeks ago.
   One of the sources, who provided a detailed briefing on the
alleged suspicious activities of the Jordanian and Yemeni
officials, said Saudi intelligence officials placed the diplomats
under surveillance immediately after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
   ``The movements of the Iraqi diplomats were immediately
restricted so it was obvious they would need help if they wanted to
egange in espionage,'' this source said.
   ``The Jordanians and Yemenis were observed taking long drives to
areas in which they had no business,'' including the Eastern
Province, the center of the kingdom's oil economy.
   The source said Saudi officials also monitored a series of
meetings between the Jordanian, Yemeni and Iraqi diplomatic
officials.
   Another diplomatic source said Saudi military officials had told
him that Jordanian and Yemeni diplomatic aides were monitored
taking photographs of Saudi military, government and economic
installations, including oil refineries and military bases where
American troops are based.
   ``It appeared to the military to be reconnaissance,'' the source
said.
   In announcing the expulsions late Saturday, the Saudi Ministry
of Foreign Affairs said only that the Jordanian, Iraqi and Yemeni
diplomats were being asked to leave the country because they
``engaged in activities jeopardizing the peace and security of the
kingdom. These activities do not conform with diplomatic rules and
regulations.''
   The Foreign Ministry statements said the Saudi government
complained to the three governments about ``the blatant and
flagrant infringements'' but that the suspicious activities
continued.
   The Saudis then demanded that the governments sharply reduce the
number of diplomats in Saudi Arabia. Diplomatic sources said 56
Yemenis, 10 Jordanians and 14 Iraqis were covered by the expulsion
order.

   Determined to hike the 2,100-mile
Appalachian Trail despite his blindness, Bill Irwin has replaced
his lust for wine and women with a devotion to God that guides his
every, deliberate step.
   He has come almost 1,800 miles since leaving Georgia six months
ago with his guide dog Orient. Irwin has raversed mountaintops and
braved blizzards, craved cheeseburgers and greasy french fries,
broken a rib and fallen an estimated 3,000 times.
   His destination is Mount Katahdin, Maine, more than 300 miles
away. If he gets there, Irwin will be the first blind man known to
hike the entire Appalachian Trail.
   In the mountains of New Hampshire, Irwin talked about the days
of wine, women and song, when he was an alcoholic, womanizer and
smoked five packs of cigarettes a day.
   ``I was a jet-setter, playboy - the only woman I liked better
than my wife was your wife,'' he joked.
   The Bible replaced booze four years ago, when he didn't think he
could sink any lower, he said.
   Alone and with a six-mile hike and a crash course on survival as
training, Irwin began his quest.
   ``We just set out to come to Maine,'' Irwin said in his
Burlington, N.C., drawl.
   He wandered the Georgia wilderness for four days, not sure if he
was lost.
   ``Starting out on Springer Mountain all alone in the middle of
the worst flood in the history of Georgia ... not even knowing how
I was going to get down the trail,'' was the scariest portion of
the trip, he said.
   Irwin wears pads to protect his knees from the 15 falls he said
he takes daily.
   But Irwin said he has become proficient at staying on the trail,
and knows when Orient has strayed.
   ``I can tell by the way he turns his head that we are off the
trail. Because when he's not certain, he is sniffing the ground and
walking with hesitancy,'' he said.
   Irwin, 50, headed for Mount Washington on Sunday after a day of
shopping in Conway. Battered by treacherous hiking in New
Hampshire, where the terrain is rougher, Irwin's pace has slowed
from 15 miles per day to about six.
   Though he can't see the magnificent vistas, the trailside
sunsets or other views that sighted people experience, Irwin said
he finds solace in the silence, beauty in the odors and sensations
of nature, and tries to construct images of the landscape. When
others are around, he asks them to describe the scene.
   ``I still rely on visual imagery more than anything else,''
Irwin said.
   It wasn't always so for this broad-shouldered, lumbering man
with scruffy blonde hair.
   Irwin had normal vision until the age of 28, when he was struck
with chorio retinitis, a disease that destroys the retina.
   Though he has been chased by the media and portrayed in several
tabloid magazines - one which had him clutching a sapling, dangling
above a gorge - Irwin said he never meant to put himself in the
spotlight.
   ``I'm no great example of anything,'' he said. ``Any blind
person that is capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go
through the same difficulty.''
   The stories and faces will remain long after he finishes the
trip and tries to parlay his experience into a business that
combines hiking and counseling, Irwin said.
   Irwin said he won't forget ``The Irish Goat,'' an untidy, crusty
hiker who woke everyone one night with his screams. A mouse had
perched on the old man's beard and was eating remnants from that
evening's meal, Irwin said, bursting into laughter.
   In New York, the mosquitoes were so bad one day that Irwin tied
a bandana over his face. A woman, startled at the sight of a man
hiking with his face and eyes covered, asked him if he was crazy,
Irwin said.
   ``Just taking this seeing-eye dog for a training run,'' Irwin
replied.

   The temblor terrified residents of this northwestern city, who

   There were no immediate reports of loss of life or property,

   Another college student set himself on
fire today in the latest of a series of increasingly violent
protests against a plan to give more government jobs to members of
lower castes.
   Earlier today, police used tear gas to disperse a mob near
Parliament House, and the police headquarters in the capital was
besieged for three hours by angry students.
   The upper-caste students say reserving desirable government jobs
for members of lower castes amounts to reverse discrimination; the
government says the downtrodden deserve more opportunities.
   Witnesses said the 22-year-old student doused himself with
gasoline in the capital's busiest intersection and then set himself
ablaze. He was badly burned, and a doctor said he was unlikely to
live through the night.
   A report said two other people set themselves on fire in
Jaiphur, 180 miles southwest of New Delhi. United News of India
said both were being treated for third-degree burns.
   Today's suicide attempt in the capital took place at an
intersection on New Delhi's busy Ring Road. Since Thursday, it has
been the site of a protest by hundreds of students.
   The other demonstrators said they did not know of the student's
plans to set himself on fire.
   ``We were sitting under the tent when we saw a ball of black
smoke ... and caught the stench of burning flesh,'' said Kamal
Kishore Sharma, who rushed to the aid of the burned student,
identified as Singh Chauhan.
   More than a dozen other students have set themselves on fire in
protests, and two suffered serious burns and are in critical
condition. During the weekend, a 16-year-old schoolboy killed
himself by swallowing insecticide.
   Hundreds of thousands of students have turned out for
demonstrations, and at least 25 students have been killed in street
battles with police since the new policy was announced Aug. 7.
   No political party has supported the students' position, and the
army has been sent in to maintain law and order in four cities.
Schools and colleges have been closed in many towns.
   The policy reserves 27 percent of government jobs for people
from low castes, who suffered for centuries under India's strict
social hierarchy. Another 22.5 percent were previously kept aside
for the most backward castes and native tribes.
   Singh set a further quota of 5 to 10 percent of jobs for poor
people irrespective of caste, leaving about 40 percent of the 18
million white-collar government jobs available on merit alone.
   Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the popluation, are divided
into four castes and hundreds of sub-castes. Discrimination on the
basis of caste is illegal, but in practice the system permeates
much of Indian life, especially in the rural areas.

   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
was reported in critical condition today after undergoing surgery
for the second time in five days to remove excess blood from the
brain.
   The 91-year-old church leader was recovering at LDS Hospital
after the Sunday afternoon surgery.
   On Wednesday, a neurosurgeon removed two blood clots from
Benson's brain. Church spokesman Don LeFevre said doctors drained
more blood on Sunday.
   Benson was hospitalized Tuesday after complaining of severe
headaches and difficulty swallowing.
   Benson was agriculture secretary under President Eisenhower. In
1985, he assumed the presidency of the 7.5-million Mormon Church,
or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Because of his frail condition, he has attended but not

   A student who tried to form a campus chapter
of a white supremacists group at his college has been arrested
after illegally burning an Israeli flag, police say.
   Matt Hale, 19, a sophomore at Bradley University in Peoria, and
Steven Thornhill, both members of the American White Supremacist
Party, were arrested Sunday after they burned the flag. They called
it a demonstration against Jewish people and the U.S. military
buildup in the Middle East.
   Hale and Thornhill, both of East Peoria, were charged with
violating a city ordinance against public bonfires on a sidewalk
and released on $50 bond each. They were scheduled to appear in
Tazewell County Circuit Court on Oct. 18.
   The two men and four other members of the supremacists group
went to Pekin to burn the flag after they were threatened with
arrest and a $500 fine in nearby Peoria if they burned the blue and
white flag there.
   ``I would have expected this if we had done it in Peoria, but
Matt was under the impression it was legal in Pekin,'' said
Champaign-area farmer John McLaughlin, a member of the supremacists
group.

<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund gave approval
today to an accelerated effort to supply billions of dollars to
help countries hurt by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The approval by the IMF's policy-making interim committee
represented a victory for the Bush administration, which is
counting on both the IMF and its sister lending agency, the World
Bank, to help in the international effort to isolate Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   In a final communique, the IMF interim committee directed the
staff of the international lending agency to ``respond on an
expedited basis to present difficulties.''
   The communique provided no specifics on how much money would be
forthcoming, but U.S. officials have discussed that three countries
alone - Egypt, Jordan and Turkey - would need between $13 billion
and $16 billion in economic assistance through the end of next
year.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the lack of
specifics did not indicate dissension on the part of the 22 finance
ministers on the interim committee, but rather a desire to leave as
much flexibility as possible for the IMF to channel aid to
countries.
   ``We recognized the urgency of the needs of the people who are
affected,'' Wilson said. ``The urgency is stated, the framework is
provided and now it is up to the IMF management to respond.''

<HEAD>Navy Wants Tuition Repaid by Homosexual Midshipman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1987 Naval Academy graduate who says he
was forced to quit the Navy because of his homosexuality is
refusing demands that he pay for his education.
   The Navy wants Orlando Gotay to pay $22,949 in tuition because
he resigned from the military before completing the five years of
service academy graduates must perform.
   Gotay, who now lives in San Francisco, said he won't pay because
officers pressured him to get out early.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has agreed to represent Gotay
in court if the Pentagon pushes the matter.
   ``First they force me out, end my career as a naval officer, and
then they tell me I have to pay them for doing this to me,'' Gotay
told The (Annapolis) Capital.
   A Navy spokeswoman said each midshipman signs a contract
promising to repay tuition if they voluntarily resign before
finishing the 5-year service obligation.
   Lt. Beci Brenton said the Navy has sent Gotay three letters
asking him to begin payments. Because he has not replied, the
account has been turned over to the U.S. Justice Department for
collection.
   In May, the Navy decided to let two gay ROTC cadets keep
scholarships after they were discharged from the training corps
because of their sexuality.
   Gotay and his lawyers said they knew of no precedent at the
Naval Academy. The Navy said Gotay's case is not the first of its
kind.
   Gotay, 26, was serving as a machinery officer aboard the USS
Belknap, flagship of the 6th Fleet, when he learned in June 1989
that he was under investigation for homosexuality.
   The inquiry did not prove any sexual misconduct, although Gotay
admits now that he is gay. The U.S. armed forces prohibit
homosexuals from military service.
   A month later, Gotay said, he was charged with fraternization,
or social contact, with enlisted personnel. His commanding officer
dismissed the charge, however, and issued him a mild reprimand.
   But Gotay said word spread about his sexual preference, making
life aboard the guided missile cruiser a nightmare.
   ``What I went through, the mental abuse and the psychological
strain, was far worse than even plebe summer,'' Gotay said,
referring to the strenuous training that academy inductees receive
their first summer in Annapolis.
   In November, Gotay got a letter from the chief of naval
operations informing him that administrative hearings on alleged
misconduct were being prepared against him, and that he could
either stand trial or resign. He resigned.
   Last March, Gotay was given an honorable discharge.
   Because of this voluntary resignation, the Navy ordered Gotay
about a week after his discharge to pay the tuition.
   Gotay said he was not aware of his own homosexuality until his
final year at Annapolis. He was aware of the military policy toward
homosexuals and kept his preferences to himself, he said.

   A freight train derailed near the city's
downtown today, forcing authorities to close a major highway during
morning rush hour because of a potential chemical leak.
   Five tanker cars and three box cars of the CSX train derailed.
One tanker leaked liquid sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical, said
fire Battalion Chief Mark Devine.
   One of several warehouses in the area, Ohio Periodical
Distributors, closed for the day as a precaution.
   A two-mile stretch of Ohio 315, a major north-south artery that
dissects the city just west of downtown, was closed after the
derailment about 4:30 a.m. but was reopened about 9 a.m. Other
streets also were closed as a precaution.
   Devine said two of the derailed tankers contained chlorine gas,
but they did not leak. One derailed box car contained non-toxic
plastic beads, used in injection molds.
   Authorities did not immediately know what the other derailed box
cars and tankers were carrying. They also did not know the train's
origin or destination.
   Franklin County Emergency Management Services spokesman John
Ross said other cars on the train carried isopentane and ammonium
nitrate.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a harshly worded ruling, a court has
overturned the acquittal of a Jewish settlement leader and
convicted him of assaulting an Arab family, the Justice Ministry
said today.
   The ministry said the three-judge District Court found Rabbi
Moshe Levinger guilty of assault, trespass and insulting a soldier
in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron in 1988.
   Jerusalem Magistrate Yoel Tsur acquitted Levinger and the state
prosecution appealed.
   According to the charge sheet, Levinger entered the home of the
Samooch family house in Hebron after his daughter claimed one of
their children had insulted her.
   Levinger was charged with assaulting Mrs. Samooch and attempting
to assault their 7-year-old daughter. He also disobeyed a soldier's
orders to leave the house, shouting at him, ``you contaminate
Israel, PLO agent.''
   The Jerusalem District Court ruled Sunday that in acquitting
Levinger, Tsur ``failed to see the forest for the trees.''
   It ordered a magistrate's court to sentence Levinger, saying the
acquittal was ``illogical.''
   A Justice Ministry statement called the ruling ``one of the rare
instances in which the court of appeals intervened in factual
evidence and in determining the credibility of witnesses.''
   Levinger founded Hebron's Jewish community after Israel captured
the town from Jordan in 1967.
   In August he completed a five-month jail term for fatally
shooting a Palestinian merchant in Hebron in 1988.
   He plea-bargained a manslaughter charge down to death by
negligence, claiming he fired in self-defense against Arab
stone-throwers.

<NOTE>EDs: Subs graf 2, It is, to include that Turner is Republican
candidate.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today urged District of
Columbia voters to support former police chief Maurice Turner for
mayor, saying Turner ``is dead set at getting the deadwood out of
city government.''
   ``It is time for a change,'' Bush said at at $250-per-plate
breakfast fund-raiser for Turner, the Republican mayoral candidate.
``It is time to put Chief Turner in charge of the entire city.''
   The president also praised Turner for his 32-year police career
and service to the nation's capital.
   ``He's got a strong message for the criminals who create a
climate of fear and the drug dealers who prey on our children -
`You can run, but you can't hide,''' Bush said. ``Help Maurice
Turner turn this city around. No one is more dead set at getting
the deadwood out of city government.''
   Turner thanked Bush for his support, and predicted that he will
defeat the heavily-favored Democratic nominee, Sharon Pratt Dixon.
The two are vying for the seat held by Marion Barry, who was
recently convicted on one misdemeanor count of possession of
cocaine and did not seek re-election.
   ``I did not enter this race merely to make a good showing,''
Turner said. ``On Nov. 6, I will be the next mayor.''
   Republicans in the nation's capital believe that Turner's
popularity provides their best chance ever to win the mayor's chair
in this heavily Democratic city.
   Many Republican party officials believe that Turner, who is
black, can help the GOP attract minorities. When Turner, a lifelong
Democrat, switched parties last year, the event was publicized in
an Oval Office photo opportunity with Bush.
   And when Turner announced he would run for mayor, he did so with
pledges of fund-raising and strategy help from the GOP.
   But Turner differs with the president on local and national
issues - Bush is against statehood for the nation's capital, while
Turner advocates it. The former law enforcement official also
favors abortion rights.
   Turner faces an uphill battle to defeat Dixon, the upset winner
in the Democratic mayoral primary.
   Dixon, who has never held elective office, defeated several
veteran city council members Sept. 11 by pledging to clean up local
government following Barry's drug and perjury trial.
   She has concentrated on portraying Turner as a member of Barry's
administration, and has sought to blame him for the heavy increase
in drug-related crime that occurred while he was police chief.
   But the crucial factor in the race may be voter registration -
Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 9-1 margin in the district.

<TEXT>
   Equal numbers of police and demonstrators
gathered outside a courthouse today at the opening of the obscenity
trial of an art gallery and its director for showing Robert
Mapplethorpe's photographs.
   Jury selection was scheduled to get under way this morning in
the trial of the Contemporary Arts Center and Dennis Barrie.
   The case has become a rallying point for artists, First
Amendment activists and those who believe the indictments are part
of a wider effort to intimidate homosexuals.
   ``We think the prosecution is motivated by homophobia,'' said
Scott MacLarty, spokesman for the Gay-Lesbian March Activists. ``We
think it is motivated by hatred for artists.''
   MacLarty was among 50 people who gathered outside the Hamilton
County Courthouse to demonstrate against prosecution of the
gallery. About the same number of police patrolled on foot, on
horseback and on motorcycles.
   ``In Cincinnati, artists risk criminal prosecution. If they
succeed here, they will spread their inquisition elsewhere,''
MacLarty said earlier.
   But Monty Lobb Jr., president of Citizens Concerned for
Community Values, an anti-obscenity activist group in Cincinnati,
said the Mapplethorpe prosecution is necessary in order to
safeguard the community's moral standards.
   ``People should understand Cincinnati. The material that's been
indicted and is before the court now, there's nothing like that
available in Cincinnati. You don't have it in videotapes, you don't
have it in magazines, books - nothing here in Cincinnati,'' Lobb
said in an earlier interview. ``To say nothing about it would be a
form of acceptance. We don't want that. The people don't want
that.''
   The seven-week exhibition of photos by Mapplethorpe, who died of
AIDS in 1989, drew a record crowd of more than 80,000 to the
gallery last spring.
   But a grand jury indicted Barrie and the gallery, concluding
that seven of the 175 photos violated community standards. One
photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Others show
oral sex and anal penetration with objects.
   Barrie, 43, and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity
and with using children in nudity-related material. The second
charge stems from two photos, one of a boy and one of a girl, their
genitals exposed.
   If convicted, Barrie could get up to six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine on each count. The gallery could be fined $5,000 on
each count.
   Municipal Judge David Albanese earlier ruled each photo can be
considered separately. He rejected defense arguments that the
entire exhibit be considered as a whole, including Mapplethorpe's
portraits and floral studies.
   Defense lawyers have argued that the gallery is a museum and is
thus protected from obscenity laws. But Albanese said the
Contemporary Arts Center does not fit the definition of a museum,
since it has no permanent collection.
   The exhibit was canceled at the Corcoran Art Gallery in
Washington last year because of a furor over government funding of
art deemed obscene.
   The National Endowment for the Arts has since adopted a policy
requiring grant applicants to certify their awards will not be used
for work that might be deemed obscene. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
had pressed for the policy.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit has appeared in several U.S. cities
without incident. It is on display now at the Institute for
Contemporary Art in Boston.
   Barrie, who has been director of the Contemporary Arts Center
since 1983 and holds a doctorate in American cultural art from
Wayne State University, has said the indictments reflect the
thinking of a small group of conservatives.
   ``I think these are all attempts to limit the First Amendment.
It scares some of these groups who want only one point of view -
their point of view,'' he said.

   The 12th tropical depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season lost speed overnight and was drifting on a
northwesterly course today with no immediate threat to land,
forecasters said.
   At 6 a.m., tropical depression No. 12 was centered about 700
miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands off West Africa,
according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   The system was drifting to the north-northwest near 3 mph with a
top sustained wind speed of 35 mph. It was expected to pick up some
forward speed by Tuesday morning, but little change was expected in
its top sustained wind speed during that time, the center reported.
   Sunday evening, the season's 11th tropical depression dissipated
in the mid-Atlantic, losing its center at about 700 miles
east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.
   Tropical depressions are redesignated tropical storms if their
maximum sustained wind speed tops 39 mph. Storms become hurricanes
if wind speed reaches 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30.
Storms are normally most active in September.

   Foreign Minister David Levy said today Israel
is taking the Iraqi military threat seriously and ``will do what we
have to do'' if attacked.
   Levy's comments came a day after Iraq named Israel as a possible
target it Baghdad continues to be ``strangled'' by sanctions. It
said Israel would be be included ``in all actions that affect the
owners of the homeland in which the forces of evil and occupation
have settled.''
   Levy, who is visiting New York, told Israel radio his government
``is taking these threats seriously and gravely ... and if Israel
is endangered or, God forbid, attacked, we will do what we have to
do.''
   In Jerusalem, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement today
warning that Israel would ``respond appropriately'' to an Iraqi
attack.
   The statement, read to reporters by spokesman Moshe Raviv,
described Iraq's threats as a sign of ``isolation and weakness''
and said Saddam Hussein had underestimated the West's will to
respond to his invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Likewise, he may underestimate the capacity and resolve of
Israel,'' Raviv said. ``Israel has proved in the past that it knows
how to defend itself and, if attacked, it will not hesitate to
respond appropriately.''
   The foreign minister said Israel would give Iraq no pretext for
an attack, but said the multinational buildup in the Persian Gulf
``is liable to accelerate the carrying out of the threat against
Israel and we need to take this into account.''
   Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot's military
correspondent, citing an assessment by senior Israeli officials,
said war in the region ``is inevitable, and everything is now a
matter of time and the Americans choosing suitable targets.'' The
officials were not identified.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos will testify with immunity this
week in a federal investigation of allegations that Westinghouse
Electric Corp. paid a $17.3 million bribe to the Philippines
government, her lawyer said.
   Attorney James Linn said Mrs. Marcos was assured of immunity by
Theodore Greenberg, deputy chief of the U.S. Justice Department's
fraud division. Both Greenberg and Westinghouse spokesman Paul
Jones declined to comment on the grand jury proceedings.
   The panel is scheduled to question Mrs. Marcos on Tuesday. It is
investigating allegations that Westinghouse bribed the Philippines
government to obtain a contract to build a nuclear power plant when
Mrs. Marcos' late husband, Ferdinand, was president.
   Last week, Westinghouse said it paid $17 million in commissions
during 10 years to sales representatives who handled the reactor
contract. Two previous federal investigations of the payments found
no evidence of wrongdoing, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.
   Mrs. Marcos has been subpoenaed to bring all documents related
to payments made to Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe Enterprises Inc.
of Oradell, N.J.
   Westinghouse built the $2.3 billion power plant about 60 miles
west of Manila in the early 1980s. Burns &amp; Roe was a subcontractor.
The plant has never been operated.
   Mrs. Marcos also was asked to bring records the government kept
on Herminio Disini, who is charged with receiving the bribe. Disini
was married to a cousin of Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos has records neither about the payment nor Disini,
Linn said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 15 Japanese politicians arrived in North
Korea today on a visit Japan hopes will help thaw icy relations
between the two Asian neighbors.
   In a sign of a positive reception from North Korea, its official
Korean Central News Agency reported the group's arrival without the
usual virulent references to Japan.
   The delegation of legislators from Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic and Socialist parties was met at Pyongyang's airport by
Kim Yong Sun, secretary of the central committee of the Worker's
Party of Korea, the Communist nation's ruling party, KCNA said in a
report monitored in Tokyo.
   The delegation is led by Shin Kanemaru, one of the Japanese
governing party's most influential leaders.
   Kanemaru was expected to seek the release of Japanese seamen
being held in North Korea as a first step toward closer ties
between the two countries, which have no formal diplomatic
relations.
   Kanemaru also was expected to carry an apology from Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to the North Korean people for Japan's
1910-45 occupation of Korea.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said the mission's aim
was to ``pave the way for the release of two seamen and to help
open dialogue between the two countries.''
   The Japanese seamen have been held in North Korea on espionage
charges since November 1983. Pyongyang has pressed for the return
of a North Korean defector in exchange for their release, but Japan
has refused the demand.
   North Korea is one of the few countries with which Japan has no
diplomatic relations, although only 350 miles of sea separate the
two nations. Pyongyang has long maintained that South Korea, Japan
and U.S. ``imperialists'' are planning an invasion.
   The Japan Socialist Party, along with the Japan-North Korea
Parliamentarian Goodwill League, has acted as a bridge between the
two countries.
   The mission flew directly to Pyongyang aboard a Japan Airlines
chartered jet, rather than taking the usual route through Beijing.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to the end o World War
II in 1945, when the Korean peninsula was divided into the
communist North and capitalist South.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein's obsession with secrecy
has undermined the military strength of Iraq, but his tank and
artillery forces remain formidable, military analysts said in a
report today.
   During the eight-year war against Iran, Saddam and his high
command rarely passed information to divisional commanders, said
the analysis in a special issue of Jane's Soviet Intelligence
Review.
   It said this secrecy made ``all-out attacks a virtual
impossibility.'' Given Saddam's ``autocratic tightening of control
since then,'' the report said, the situation is likely to have
worsened.
   It added that although much of Iraq's military equipment is
obsolete by Western and Soviet standards, the more modern weapons
were ``capable of inflicting damage'' on the multinational forces
that have gathered in the gulf region since Iraq seized Kuwait Aug.
2.
   Iraq has about 5,000 battle tanks, including about 200
British-made Chieftain and Vickers tanks seized in Kuwait, said the
report.
   On air power, the report cited Iraq's Soviet Badger strike
aircraft, with a combat range of nearly 2,000 miles, as among its
most potent weapons. But the report said the Iraq air force had
been used relatively little during the Iran-Iraq war and its
capabilities remained uncertain.

   Israel will demolish houses and shops to punish
the Palestinian refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip where an
Israeli soldier was stoned to death and then burned in his car,
military officers and Arab reports said today.
   Israel also is considering the deportation of Palestinians
suspected of involvement in the killing.
   The soldier, Sgt. Amnon Pomeranz, 46, was stoned to death on
Thursday in Gaza's El Bureij refugee camp after his car hit a
donkey cart, injuring two Palestinian teen-agers. The Palestinian
mob then set his car on fire with him inside.
   Arab reports said the army ordered at least 20 families in the
camp to remove their belongings from their homes. Such orders
usually precede the demolition of houses.
   They also said the owners of 13 shops and one gas station were
ordered to vacate their premises, apparently in advance of
demolition.
   The gas station apparently was the one from which Palestinians
obtained gas-soaked rags that they threw on the soldier's car to
set it on fire.
   Hasham Mahamid, a member of the Israeli parliament, said after a
one-hour visit to the camp that he saw the owner of the gas station
and at least a dozen shopkeepers removing goods from their shops.
   ``People told me there might be 37 houses and shops demolished
and that they expected it to be soon,'' Mahamid said.
   Pomeranz was the 48th Israeli to die in the 34-month Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 730 Palestinians, and
264 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaboration with Israel.
   The El Bureij camp, home to 20,000 Palestinians, was under
curfew today for the fifth day while soldiers combed the area for
suspects. Associated Press reporters were turned away from the camp
by soldiers because of the curfew.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens was quoted in the Hebrew daily
Hadashot today as demanding the deportation of those involved in
the murder ``if there is not enough evidence to bring the suspects
to trial.''
   The newspaper said Arens ordered the army's legal officers to
check out ways to speed up the deportation process, which can take
months because of appeal procedures.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh declined comment on the
report, saying he could not discuss ``specific actions that are
going to be taken.''
   Israel has deported 61 Arabs for ``instigating and perpetrating
anti-Israeli violence'' since the uprising began in December 1987.
The last deportation was in August 1989.

   Vietnam's deputy prime minister met today with
Chinese Premier Li Peng in what appeared to be a bid to smooth over
longstanding strains between the two nations.
   Vietnam's Communists were backed by the Chinese during the 1960s
and 1970s. But when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and
ousted the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge, China responded by attacking
Vietnam.
   A brief, bloody border war was followed by a decade of verbal
and occasional military sniping.
   However, relations have improved over the past year as the two
sides have worked to resolve the fighting in Cambodia.
   The nationally televised evening news showed a smiling Vo Nguyen
Giap shaking hands and chatting with Li.
   ``I'm very pleased to meet Premier Li Peng,'' Giap was quoted by
the television news as saying. ``It's been more than 10 years since
I've met such a high-level Chinese leader.''
   Giap was in Beijing for the opening of the Asian Games.
   Early this month, Vietnamese Communist Party chief Nguyen Van
Linh secretly visited Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders on the
Cambodian conflict and Sino-Vietnamese relations. His delegation
included Prime Minister Do Muoi and senior party advisor and former
premier Pham Van Dong, according to Thai officials and Western
diplomats.
   Giap conveyed greetings from top Vietnamese leaders, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Neither news report gave details of their discussions.

   Thirteen people arrested during a
protest of a study of marine mining potential off the Oregon Coast
were released from jail early today.
   The Coast Guard made the arrests Sunday after an activist from
the environmental group Greenpeace chained herself to a crane on
the research vessel Aloha, about a mile off the mouth of the Rogue
River at Gold Beach.
   A spokesman at the Curry County jail said the 13 were released
before dawn. Seven of those arrested were Greenpeace activists.
   Sunday's protest was led by the 181-foot Greenpeace flagship
Rainbow Warrior and included about two dozen local fishing boats.
   Local fishermen and Greenpeace oppose the research, saying
mining the sea floor would destroy fisheries.
   The Aloha began a two-week, government-sponsored cruise last
week.
   The Rainbow Warrior remained anchored off Gold Beach this
morning, said crew member Rien Achterman. He said the vessel's
plans for today had not been announced.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Cynthia Rust said she expected protests
to continue even after the Rainbow Warrior leaves.
   ``The local fishermen are part of this protest,'' she said. ``I
doubt very seriously their opposition to offshore mining will stop
just because the Greenpeace boat leaves.''
   Two Greenpeace activists boarded the 143-foot Aloha about noon
Sunday.
   One, Diana Desnoyers, 30, climbed an A-frame crane at the stern
of the Aloha and chained herself 15 feet above the deck. Coast
Guardsmen cut her loose and arrested her about an hour later.
   The Coast Guard seized three Greenpeace inflatable boats and the
32-foot Top Gun, a sea urchin diving vessel based in Port Orford.
   The arrests and boat seizures came because the vessels violated
a 500-yard, federally-ordered safety zone around the Aloha, Coast
Guard Lt. Doug Stephan said.
   Stephan said five Coast Guard vessels and a helicopter remained
in the area.
   ``It's apparent to us now that we're going to have to enforce
that safety zone as long as the Aloha is there,'' he said.

   President Bush welcomed South African
President F.W. de Klerk to the White House today in a show of
political support for his efforts to guide South Africa toward a
post-apartheid democratic system.
   ``It's marvelous being here,'' the South African leader said at
the outset of one-on-one talks with Bush in the Oval Office.
   Both presidents, sitting in wingback chairs by the fireplace,
declined to answer questions from reporters allowed to witness the
opening moments. After a brief explanation from Bush on his
practice of refusing to answer questions at photo opportunities, de
Klerk said, ``I think I shall abide by the Oval Office rules.''
   ``I'm going to do this the president's way,'' said de Klerk,
smiling broadly.
   It was the first-ever meeting between the two leaders. After
their private session, they were meeting with top aides, then
repairing to the White House's residential quarters for a working
luncheon.
   Bush was intent on paying tribute to de Klerk for the leadership
he has provided in beginning to dismantle white supremacist rule in
South Africa. Their discussion was partly aimed at devising ways
the United States can help speed the process.
   No South African head of state has visited Washington since
1945. As recently as the Reagan administration, the two countries
were barely on speaking terms because of the sanctions Congress
imposed on South Africa in 1986.
   But the U.S. attitude toward South Africa changed dramatically
with the liberalizing steps de Klerk has taken, including freeing
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison and
lifting bans on democratic political groups.
   Still, de Klerk's visit is less triumphal than many had hoped
because of the recent upsurge in violence in South African black
townships. The death toll is estimated at about 750.
   The violence may have contributed to the Congressional Black
Caucus' decision to cancel a scheduled meeting with de Klerk. The
announcement on Saturday gave no specific reason for the
cancellation.
   Mandela has sought to hold pro-apartheid security elements of
the police and military responsible for the violence, a possibility
that South African officials do not dismiss. Mandela has said that
Americans should demand from de Klerk an explanation for the
increasing violence.
   The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a
Washington-based private group, has challenged de Klerk to ensure
that ``police and military assassination squads are fully exposed
and completely disbanded.''
   De Klerk said on his arrival Sunday he was bringing a message of
hope for the future of his country and for all of southern Africa.
   ``We are proceeding irreversibly on the road to a new South
Africa, where justice, the guarantees of constitutional democracy
and the rule of law will bring lasting peace and prosperity to all
our people,'' said de Klerk. He is staying in Washington until
Tuesday night.
   An administration official who briefed reporters said de Klerk's
visit is not designed to bring about an end to U.S. sanctions.
South Africa has fulfilled some, but not all, of the conditions
required by law for the sanctions to be lifted.
   De Klerk said Saturday the sanctions will not be a major focus
of his visit.
   ``I'm not going hat in hand with the particular objective of
getting sanctions lifted,'' he said.

   A bomb being
manufactured by leftist students exploded in their offices at the
state university, killing two students and wounding three others,
police said.
   The explosion occurred Sunday night in the offices of the
National Union of Revolutionary Students. Police said they found a
large quantity of gunpowder and other explosives in the building,
which was destroyed.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Mota Paulino, head of the national police, said
a preliminary investigation indicated the students intended to
place bombs in supermarkets and other businesses.
   The bombings were to coincide with the scheduled start Tuesday
of a three-day strike to protest the government's economic
austerity program. Under the program, the prices of many basic
consumer items such as gasoline and flour rose sharply in August.
   There was no immediate comment from officials of the student
organization.

   A carbide oven exploded at a chemical
plant in Transylvania on Monday, killing five people and injuring
10 others, state radio said.
   The explosion occurred in Tirnaveni, about 250 miles north of
the capital. Six people were hospitalized with severe burns, two in
critical condition, radio said.
   State radio quoted the plant's chief engineer as saying that the
explosion badly damaged the building and its mechanical and
electric equipment.
   Hot chemical material spewed around the area and prevented
workers from removing the debris, it said. A second fire broke out
but was extinguished.
   It was the third explosion at a chemical plant in the past two
months. All occurred in Transylvania, a region of tense tensions
between ethnic Romanians and a sizable ethnic Hungarian minority.
   Explosions have occurred before in Romania's huge chemical
industry, but were not publicized under the late Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu's regime, which was toppled last December.

   The Soviet Union has made available copies of
documents captured at the end of World War II that contain the
names of 400,000 people who died or were interned in Nazi
concentration and forced labor camps.
   The American Red Cross said today it has opened a Holocaust and
War Victims Tracing and Information Center in Baltimore to help
people learn the fate of friends or relatives.
   The announcement said the International Red Cross had received
from the Soviets copies of archival material recovered by the
Soviet Army during the liberation of the camps at the end of the
war.
   The material includes 46 books containing nearly 70,000 death
certificates from the Auschwitz concentration camps. Also included
are the names of 130,000 prisoners used for forced labor in various
German firms, and 200,000 names of victims in other camps,
including Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Gross Rosen and Buchenwald.
   The documents are being housed at the International Tracing
Service, an agency of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
in Arolsen, West Germany. There were already 13 million names on
file at Arolsen.
   The Red Cross said the Baltimore center can help people obtain
certification of incarceration, forced labor or death of family
members. It also can help survivors who were interned receive
compensation and may in some cases result in reunification of
family members, the organization said.
   ``We hope that this tracing service will bring some closure to
the pain felt by so many people who don't know what happened to
members of their family,'' said Stephen H. Richards, executive vice
president of the American Red Cross.
   People wishing to learn the fate of family members were urged to
contact their local chapters of the American Red Cross. Local
caseworkers will send the information to the center in Baltimore,
where it will be translated into German and forwarded to Arolsen.
   ``We want people to be aware of the availability of this
important new information,'' said Richards. He cautioned, however,
that the tracing process is slow because of the cross-referencing
needed, because of various spellings of names and because of
possible inaccuracies in the records. He said people who ask for
help will get interim reports as the work proceeds.
   The service is a collaborative effort of the Central Maryland
Chapter and American Red Cross International Services, working with
the International Committee of the Red Cross, other national Red
Cross and Red Crescent societies, and Magen David Adom, the Israeli
counterpart of the American Red Cross, the organization said.
   Those wishing more information were urged to contact their local
Red Cross chapters or call the Red Cross toll-free hotline at
1-800-848-9277.

   Sen. Alan Cranston said today he will vote
against the nomination of Supreme Court nominee David Souter. He
was the first senator to go on record against the New Hampshire
jurist, whose confirmation is widely seen as assured.
   Cranston complained that Souter, in three days of testimony to
the Senate Judiciary Committee, refused to back abortion rights.
   ``I will vote `no' because Judge Souter will not reveal his
views on a fundamental constitutional issue - the right of
privacy,'' Cranston, of California, the assistant Democratic
leader, said in a floor speech.
   After Cranston stated his opposition in a floor speech, Sen.
Howell Heflin, D-Ala., stood up to announce his endorsement. He
said he believed the 51-year-old New Hampshire jurist possesses the
``endearing quality of being willing to listen, to be fair and
impartial.''
   The statements came as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepared
to vote on President Bush's selection to replace retired Associate
Justice William Brennan on the nation's highest court. That vote
could come as early as Thursday.
   A vote by the full Senate is likely soon after that, perhaps in
time for Souter to take his seat when the Supreme Court returns to
the bench Oct. 1.
   Cranston had stated his intention in an interview Sunday.
   ``I cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a
woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental
right or that the right of individuals, married or unmarried, to
use contraceptives to prevent a pregnancy, is a matter of settled
law,'' Cranston said.
   ``I cannot support a nominee who regards these issues as open
questions,'' he said.
   ``My view of my responsibility under the Constitution to the
generations of Americans who will be affected by those decisions,
particularly the millions of young women whose very lives may well
depend on the right to choose whether or not to carry a pregancy,
compels me to vote `no' on this nomination,'' Cranston said.
   Souter said during his confirmation hearings that he has not
made up his mind on how he would vote if he, as a justice, was
asked to overturns the 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that legalized
abortion.
   Heflin is one of three senators who usually hold the balance of
power between the liberal and conservative wings of the Judiciary
Committee. In 1987, he opposed President Reagan's nomination of
Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.
   While some groups have opposed Souter because he refused to
discuss his views on abortion, Heflin said today he thinks it wrong
to demand that nominees express their ``precise opinions'' on such
issues before confirmation.
   After listening to Souter's testimony before the Judiciary
Committee, Heflin said, he is satisfied Souter understands the
importance of judicial restraint and prior court interpretations of
the Bill of Rights and the due process and equal protection clauses
of key constitutional amendments.
   ``Judge Souter will not bring a scorched-earth philosophy to the
court, but he will bring a sense of historic perspective and a
clear-headed approach to the analysis of legal issues,'' said
Heflin, a former Alabama chief justice.

<TEXT>
   Sequoia celebrates its
centennial Tuesday as the second-oldest national park with its
superintendent hoping the home of the world's biggest trees will be
even better 100 years from now.
   A 13,255-foot mountain, one of thousands in the Sierra Nevada
range that forms California's spine, will be named Centennial peak
during a brief ceremony honoring both Sequoia and its slightly
younger cousin, Kings Canyon National Park.
   However, most of the celebration was on Sunday when people were
invited to visit the adjacent parks free and learn about their
history and future. Sequoia, 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles,
became a national park six days before Kings Canyon and their more
celebrated neighbor 80 miles north, Yosemite.
   President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation on Sept. 25,
1890, making Sequoia the second national park. Yellowstone was
established in 1872.
   At first, only 500 people a year visited the California parks
because they were so remote in the days before cars. Now, more than
1.6 million people a year visit Sequoia and Kings Canyon.
   That has caused park officials to start reducing human impact by
moving public facilities out of Sequoia's Giant Forest area, a
process that will take at least until the beginning of the 21st
century.
   ``We want to avoid designing facilities that lure people to one
spot and cause a crowd,'' Superintendent J. Thomas Ritter said as
he stood near the General Sherman tree, the largest living thing in
the world at 272 feet tall and containing 63,664 cubic feet of
lumber.
   The goal, he said, is to disperse people to points of interest
and programs spread throughout the park. ``If we are successful
today and the next 100 years, we will have overcome our biggest
potential problem,'' he said.
   Ritter noted that the task of dispersing people is easier over
the large area of Sequoia-Kings Canyon than at Yosemite, where
almost all the 3 million visitors a year want to visit narrow
Yosemite Valley.
   Visitors to Kings Canyon can travel to Grant Grove and look at
the General Grant Tree, officially the Nation's Christmas Tree, or
camp and hike along the John Muir Trail to high country lakes
formed by melting snow.
   Others can head south through the tall pines and firs of Sequoia
to the even taller and broader trees, many of them growing since
before Jesus was born.
   People can take a healthy hike a few hundred feet up to Moro
Rock and look over the western divide or a much longer, harder hike
up Mount Whitney, at 14,495 feet above sea level the tallest
mountain in the contiguous 48 states.
   ``The people clearly have to come on the natural terms of the
park,'' Ritter said. ``But the geography is in our favor.''

   The Soviet coast guard Monday released a
Norwegian ship it had detained for a border violation during an
anti-nuclear protest in the arctic, an environmental group said.
   Also Monday, Finland announced that it, Norway and Sweden will
clean up pollution caused by nickel plants on the Soviet Kola
Peninsula. The industrial plants annually emit more than 670,000
tons of sulfur dioxide, a chief cause of acid rain, and are
polluting northern Europe.
   The Soviet coast guard seized the Norwegian ship MS Genius on
Friday. It claimed the five environmentalists on board violated
Soviet territory by taking test samples near a nuclear weapons test
site on Novaya Zemlya island in the Soviet arctic, said Norway's
Bellona environmental group.
   The 90-foot Genius was escorted out of a 200-mile Soviet
economic zone Monday and returned to the Norwegian arctic port of
Kirkenes, the group said in a statement.
   Activists had positioned the ship near Novaya Zemlya for more
than two weeks.
   Bellona claims the Soviets plan to resume nuclear weapons
testing on the island, last used in 1988.
   ``We are satisfied with having hampered the Soviet test blast,''
said Frode Haaland, of Bellona. The Soviet Embassy has said there
were no immediate plans for a test.
   Novaya Zemlya, a primary Soviet nuclear test site from 1958 to
1963, is about 370 miles from Norwegian territory.
   Unconfirmed reports that testing was to resume on the island
have prompted protests from Nordic governments and environmental
groups.
   In announcing the pollution cleanup plan, Finland said it would
provide funding and technology for 50 percent of the $750 million
program, due to be completed in 1994.
   Earlier this month, the Norwegian government set aside $50
million. Sweden and possibly Germany also will participate, the
Finnish government said.
   Finland's President Mauno Koivisto discussed the cross-border
pollution with Mikhail S. Gorbachev when the Soviet president came
to Helsinki Sept. 8 for a summit with President Bush.
   Finnish researchers have warned that the pollution is destroying
Lapland, an area that stretches across northern Finland, Sweden and
Norway, and is considered to be the last wilderness in Europe.

   Olympic fever was rampant in the Georgia capital
today as Atlanta staged its first ticker tape parade to celebrate
its designation as host of the 1996 Summer Games.
   Thousands of spectators lined the parade route, pelting Mayor
Maynard Jackson and other dignitaries with confetti and streamers
as they rode by.
   ``I'm the guy who's got to clean this stuff up,'' Jackson
laughed as he and his wife, Valerie, tried to brush the paper from
their hair.
   Glo Ruiz of suburban Kennesaw brought her two children downtown
2{ hours early to get a front-row seat for the noon parade.
   ``I'm originally from Texas, where we know what parades are all
about. This is my first parade in Atlanta, and I'm sure its going
to be just as good,'' she said.
   ``It's the biggest thing I've ever seen in Atlanta,'' said
63-year-old Leonard Johnson Sr., a lifelong resident.
   Police estimated that 50,000 people had gathered for the parade
by 11:30 a.m. Atlanta schools excused children from class to see
it, with parental approval.
   Organizers used trucks to pass out 34 tons of confetti to the
waiting crowd, and 100 miles of ticker tape was thrown from
buildings along the route.
   Other dignitaries riding in the parade included Gov. Joe Frank
Harris, Sen. Sam Nunn and 85-year-old Fred Alderman, Georgia's
oldest Olympian.

   French President Francois Mitterrand today
condemned Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait, calling Iraq a
warlike state and stressing that the sovereignty of Kuwait is not
negotiable.
   ``How could we not be disgusted by the taking of thousands of
hostages?'' he asked the General Assembly.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations listened silently, but
high-level Iraqi officials including Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
were absent. Iraq said today it had rejected a U.S. offer to allow
an Iraqi plane to fly the Iraqi delegation to New York - if about
1,000 Americans held in occupied Kuwait and Iraq were allowed to
leave.
   ``In order to prevent this anarchy and theory of might makes
right, and avoid a situation in which one powerful person might be
replaced by another, I can't find any other answer than the rule of
law, of right,'' Mitterrand said.
   Speaking of Kuwait, he said: ``the sovereignty of that country
is not negotiable.''
   He also pointed out the danger to other Persian Gulf nations,
``these neighboring peoples, who if things get out of control, will
depend on the expansionist determination of one man, on one warlike
state.''
   The French president expressed outrage over Iraq's raids on
European diplomatic compounds in Kuwait on Sept. 14, when diplomats
were detained temporarily and three Frenchmen seized.
   Iraq made a belated apology Sunday, saying its soldiers had made
a mistake. After the raids, France immediately called for an
emergency meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which
unanimously denounced Iraq.
   But Mitterrand said that was unacceptable, and noted that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has not yet made any gesture or move to
defuse the crisis.
   Brazil provided the first speaker at today's session - President
Fernando Collor de Mello.
   ``The crisis that has befallen Kuwait presents an unexpected and
serious threat to collective peace,'' he said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze speaks Tuesday. Both
President Bush and Aziz of Iraq are scheduled to address the
160-member assembly on Oct. 1.
   Aziz said Sunday, however, that his government would not
participate because the United States had prevented him from flying
to New York in an Iraqi Airways plane.
   Iraq said today it rejected a U.S. offer to allow an Iraqi plane
to fly Aziz to New York if about 1,000 Americans could leave Kuwait
and Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the offer was made after
Aziz complained to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
that Washington refused to allow his plane to come to New York.
   Perez de Cuellar said Sunday that he planned talks with Aziz in
the near future on Iraq's position that it will never give up
Kuwait, which Saddam's forces seized on Aug. 2.
   The French president had been expected to express outrage over
Iraq's raids on European diplomatic compounds. After the raids,
France immediately called for an emergency meeting of the 15-member
U.N. Security Council, which unanimously denounced Iraq.
   That resolution also warned Iraq that the Security Council would
adopt other measures to punish Baghdad.
   The measures are expected to be passed at an extraordinary
council meeting on Tuesday and include a proposal to impose an air
embargo on Iraq, the first ever by the world body against a member.
   Under the sanctions, flights from Iraq and occupied Kuwait would
be limited to those carrying refugees. Flights bound for Iraqi-held
land would be inspected and allowed only to carry shipments of food
or medicine approved by the Security Council's sanctions committee.
   Other countries would be required to deny Iraq-bound flights
permission to refuel, land, or fly over their territory. Force
would not be allowed, but planes could be ordered to land.
   In addition, nations breaking the air embargo would be subject
to secondary sanctions.
   ``I think this will be a genuine turning point in human
history,'' said Brian Urquhart, the former U.N.
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping, who retired in
1986. ``This will be the test of whether collective security is a
valid response to aggression.''
   Unlike the Security Council, the General Assembly has no
enforcement powers. However, the assembly speeches and resolutions
are a powerful expression of the will of the world community.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has scrapped its annual National
Day celebrations at embassies around the world to show solidarity
with the people of Kuwait, the embassy announced Monday.
   Lavish receptions had been scheduled for Monday evening at all
major Saudi embassies. The embassy here, located next to the famed
Watergate office and apartment complex, made cancellation calls
over the weekend to hundreds of invitees.
   Saudi Arabia ``has taken this step in solidarity with the
brotherly state of Kuwait, due to the painful calamity it faces
because of the brutal Iraqi aggression....''
   The suffering inflicted by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
affects all ``governments of the Arab and Islamic world, as well as
the whole world community,'' said the Saudi statement.
   A multinational force including 150,000 U.S. troops has been
deployed in Saudi Arabia in recent weeks to prevent an Iraqi
invasion and prepare a possible attack against President Saddam
Hussein.
   Saudi Arabia has been hosting Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family
since it fled the invading Iraqi forces. The wealthy desert kingdom
has also taken in thousands of Kuwaiti refugees.
   The National Day reception in past years has been a lavish
affair, with senior U.S. government officials, diplomats,
corporation heads and socialites in attendance.

   A private plane crashed in a
field as it approached an airport through heavy fog today, killing
at least four people, authorities said.
   ``We have four confirmed dead, but the flight plan indicated
there were five aboard,'' said Fred O'Donnell, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   The twin-engine Cessna Citation, en route from Van Nuys Airport,
was preparing to land at San Luis Obispo Airport when it apparently
clipped some trees and tumbled in a ball of flames, said police
Sgt. Ron Brown.
   The pilot made his last standard communication with the airport
tower at 7:03 a.m., and crashed three minutes later about three
miles northwest of the airport, O'Donnell said.
   The identities of the victims were not immediately available,
said San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Detective Mike Wasley.

   ABC News said today it will start in January a
pre-dawn newscast that will air each weekday from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.
The show will have two anchors, but they have not been chosen.
   The newscast, which has not been given a name, marks the second
time ABC News has tried a late-night program since the
establishment of ``Nightline'' as a regular series 10 years ago.
   The new program, in the planning stages for months, will be
competing with the 24-hour Cable News Network and CBS' taped
``Nightwatch,'' which emphasizes interviews and began in 1982.
   ABC's show is the second network news operation scheduled to
start in January.
   NBC also plans then to begin its 24-hour NBC News Channel,
serving NBC affiliates with international, national and regional
stories for use in their own local newscasts.
   The executive producer of ABC's new newscast will be John
Armstrong, now assistant bureau chief at ABC News' Washington
bureau.
   ABC said the new series is being started at the request of its
more than 200 affiliates, who now run syndicated shows or movies,
or go off in the air in the time period the new show will occupy.

<TEXT>
   What is now East Germany will spin aimlessly
in limbo for weeks after Germany unites, then slowly emerge from
the remains of the old nation as five distinct lands.
   But experts say it could take years of drastic reform to forge
truly effective, functioning states from the political and
bureaucratic rubble of the former Communist regime.
   Perhaps more important than the Oct. 3 date of German
unification is what happens after Oct. 14, when East Germans elect
the first governments of the new states their nation will become.
   Until those governments take office and begin operating, eastern
Germany essentially will be a territory, a frontier with only
inexperienced local governments chosen last May and a federal
government far away in the western city of Bonn.
   Because of the speed of unity, much of East Germany will be
wiped out politically and legally before the states are operating
at an adequate level, experts say.
   ``As far as the (regional) legislative and executive powers are
concerned, (East Germans) will live in a lawless period for perhaps
a quarter of a year,'' said Klaus Kuehne, a top official for the
East German Ministry for Regional and Community Relations.
   There will be only two or three temporary officials in the
interim assigned to each state until their governments and state
administrations materialize.
   ``Before these states are even functional in the slightest way,
1991 will have passed,'' Kuehne said. ``This doesn't even take into
account the quality of government when they are in place. There is
a dearth of qualified people.''
   These states, cut from remnants of German principalities and
Prussian provinces, will be in charge of the same things the 11
states in West Germany oversee: schools, law enforcement, some
social services and transportation.
   They will face the monumental task of creating those entities
from the centralized Communist framework that once controlled all
aspects of East German society, from apartment rents to school
curriculums.
   The first step toward decentralizing will happen Oct. 3, when
more than 200,000 federal bureaucrats in East Berlin alone will be
out of work, from ministers to office clerks.
   The states, however, are still in the early throes of the local
campaigns for the Oct. 14 elections. Scores of candidates are
competing for the governorships and state legislatures.
   The elections could be the last hurrah for the reformed
Communists, who are given little chance of winning seats when a
united German parliament is chosen Dec. 2, but may have a chance at
regional seats on Oct. 14.
   The newly coalescing states also are beginning to fight over
boundaries, to claim cities near the tentative borders and to
debate which city should be the state capital.
   Heinrich Vogel, a political analyst and East German specialist
with the Cologne, West Germany-based German Institute for Eastern
Research and International Studies, said what is happening in the
emerging states is political evolution at its most primeval.
   ``There are all kinds of grabbing instincts that are part of the
political game,'' he said.
   In what is now East Germany, the sparsely populated farmland of
the north will be Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania, where the cities of
Schwerin and Rostock are competing to be the state capital.
   The eastern-central section of the country will be Brandenburg,
a former Prussian province that will surround Berlin, the capital
of a united Germany that will have a separate status.
   The central-western section is Saxony-Anhalt, where the
industrial cities of Magdeburg, Halle and Dessau are vying to be
the capital.
   The southwest corner is Thuringia, and the region in the
southeast, bordering Czechoslovakia, is Saxony.
   The five were German provinces given to the Soviets after World
War II. The Soviet Union created the German Democratic Republic -
East Germany - in 1949 and declared the provinces dissolved in
1952.
   The Communists created a system of districts where power
emanated from the capital, East Berlin. They also created a
national police force that will have to be broken up into state
agencies.
   West German states are supplying considerable manpower and
expertise to help create a federal system in the east, said Manfred
Preiss, minister for regional and community relations.
   Because they have a virtual monopoly on administrative
experience, many of the 2 million public employees in East
Germany's 8.8. million workforce may move to administrations of the
states, Vogel said.
   But Vogel said the ingrained attitudes of Communist bureaucracy
will require substantial West German help.
   ``It's going to take quite awhile,'' he said. ``What we need is
a real transfer of know-how, of federalist behavior.''
   Education is another great concern. Vogel said it could take
years to alter the old educational system, in which teachers were
the bulwark of Communist ideology. Most teachers remain on board,
along with many headmasters.
   The legal system will basically be scrapped, since it is
radically different from the West German system. There is
essentially no civil court system.
   ``The legal apparatus is almost nonexistent,'' Vogel said.
``Those who have been judges, they're gone. Forget about the
attorneys. This is a sector that will primarily have to be filled
up by the West.''

<TEXT>
   Oil prices soared past $38 per barrel this
morning and gasoline and home heating oil both topped $1 a gallon
amid fear that war is imminent in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``People in the market
are talking about $40 a barrel as being the next target.''
   Light sweet crude was trading late this morning on the futures
marketat $38.80 per barrel for November contracts, up $3.37 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil sold above the $37
mark for the first time since the crude futures began trading on
the exchange in 1983, and within hours it had shot above $38 per
barrel.
   At one point today, oil reached as high as $38.90 a barrel.
   At the pump, the average price of a gallon of gasoline has hit
an all-time high of more than $1.38, an industry analyst said.
   The price has gone up from around $1.18 in late July, shortly
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and jumped 2.91 cents
in the two weeks since the previous survey, said the nationwide
Lundberg Survey of 18,500 gas stations.
   Iraq's leaders warned over the weekend that they would launch an
all-out war before allowing the U.N. trade embargo to ``strangle''
their nation. The statement was viewed as the first time that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had threatened a first strike, with Israel
and Mideast oil fields mentioned as potential targets.
   Recent estimates have put the price of oil at $60 per barrel if
a shooting war develops in the gulf.
   Crude's surge this morning helped pull up the prices of refined
products.
   Home heating oil shot up 9.79 cents to $1.07 per gallon for
October delivery. Unleaded gasoline rose 8.70 cents to $1.06 per
gallon for October contracts.
   Fears of supply shortages have helped keep the products high.
   Natural gas also rose sharply today, with November contracts
going up 7.3 cents to $1.945 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Hittle said today's rise in oil prices was partly attributable
to the effects of the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. The
international embargo of their crude was put in place shortly after
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, but the effects were not immediately
felt because it took ships that were already loaded several weeks
to arrive.
   ``Basically, the whole world now has gotten the last of the
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude,'' Hittle said. ``First, the Far East was
affected and then Europe and now the U.S. is feeling it.''
   Oil's previous high price on the Mercantile Exchange was $35.60
per barrel, which came on Friday to cap a string of records set
last week.
   The cash price of oil has traded at $40 amid the early 1980s oil
crisis that followed the Iranian invasion, but oil futures were not
traded on the exchange at that time.

   It's a heavenly marketing idea.
   Two nuns from Miami Shores, Fla., seeing what pictures on
T-shirts, posters and the like have done to raise the profile of
Bart Simpson, decided to do the same with the Virgin Mary, St.
Francis of Assisi and other heavenly heroes.
   Sister Kathy Hollywood said she and Sister Lorraine Hale of the
Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary got the idea
while working on doctorates on Catholic schools.
   ``During visits to Catholic schools, we asked the kids who the
teachers told them to be like,'' she recalled. ``They said Jesus
and the saints. But the kids wanted to be like Madonna.''
   The nuns responded with shirts containing colorful decals of
popular saints as a way to ``revitalize Catholic tradition in a
contemporary way,'' said Sister Kathy. She sold some of the shirts
at the Catholic Education Conference here Friday.
   The nuns also are working on saints' greeting cards and have
developed games, quizzes and puzzles for kids.
   They wouldn't be unhappy if their merchandise gives animated
anti-hero Bart Simpson a run for his money.
   ``We want to portray Catholic values,'' Sister Kathy said. ``I
don't think Bart is helping us. We hope in some way to balance out
Bart.''

   The savings and loan crisis, which has taken
its biggest toll in Texas, isn't getting much mileage on the
campaign trail there.
   The issue doesn't have much ``political pop'' in Texas, said
Richard Murray, a University of Houston political scientist and
pollster.
   ``It's been such a massive problem here, banks going under right
and left, people are almost immune to the thing,'' said James Dyer,
coordinator of the Texas Poll at Texas A&amp;M's Public Policy Research
Laboratory.
   No one mentioned the crisis as an issue during a Texas Poll of
state races this summer, he said.
   ``The average person, especially in South Texas, does not have
money invested in savings and loans or stocks and bonds,'' said
Juan Hinojosa, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Pan
American. ``They're barely staying alive and trying to survive.
They don't see it as touching them.''
   The state's gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Ann Richards and
Republican Clayton Williams, both have made campaign pitches trying
to link one another to the S&amp;L crisis.
   And Hugh Parmer, the Democratic challenger to GOP Sen. Phil
Gramm, is complaining that Gramm has incomplete campaign records
and may have accepted more thrift-related donations than he
reported.
   But such direct attacks appear to mean little to Texans.
   Texans less frequently than other Americans specifically point
blame at President Bush, President Reagan, key congressional
figures or financial managers, Murray said.
   Instead, he said, their tendency ``to blame it on all these
folks is high.''
   On Capitol Hill, in floor speeches and newsletters home, members
of Congress often vent their anger over the crisis by blaming
Texas. And that put-upon feeling may be turning many Texans off the
issue, analysts say.
   Layne Hoppe, a political scientist at Texas Lutheran College,
suggested Texans feel a collective embarrassment about the failures
of thrifts and banks.
   ``If there were a reaction against it here, it would be, in a
way, a reaction against ourselves, insofar as there's a Texas
identity,'' he said.
   Texans are less likely than people in other states to get angry
about tax dollars covering deposits at troubled Texas thrifts.
   ``Some of the things that drive it as an issue nationally don't
work so well here, like resentment at shipping oney to Texas,''
Murray said.
   Texans also may view the collapse of the state's economy
differently.
   ``There's a wider sense in Texas that the price of oil wrecked
the economy,'' Murray said. ``It's easier here to explain away the
crisis without blaming it so much on the politicians.''

<HEAD>Suspects in Killing of Utah Tourist Denied Bail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight suspects in the subway knifing murder of a
Utah tourist were denied bail today at their arraignment on murder
and robbery charges.
   Acting Justice Herbert Adlerberg denied a request by attorneys
for Yull Gary Morales, 18, and Luis Fernando Montero, 22, for a
``reasonable bail'' for their clients. The other lawyers did not
request bail.
   Morales' attorney, Joel Lutwin, argued that his client had lived
in Queens all his life and had ``no significant criminal record.''
   Assistant District Attorney Tom Schiels argued that Morales made
oral, written and videotaped statements about the Sept. 2 killing
of Brian Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah.
   Watkins was knifed to death at a midtown subway station after
the youths allegedly robbed Watkins' father of $200 and some credit
cards, slashed his pants with a box cutter and then punched and
kicked his mother.
   His murder touched off a wave of outrage among residents who are
concerned at the growing number of murders and violent crimes in
the city.
   The family, in town to attend the U.S. Open tennis tournament in
Queens, had attended the tennis matches in the afternoon and were
on their way to dinner when the robbery occurred.
   Schiels said Morales, whose street name is ``Rocstar,''
``admitted he did the stabbing.'' He said the group robbed the
family to get money to go dancing at a Manhattan disco.
   The prosecutor said the murder weapon, a double-bladed butterfly
knife, was found in Morales' home the day after the murder and
pants and a T-shirt allegedly worn by the suspect had human blood
on them.
   Schiels also argued that Morales organized the robbery and
showed others in the group the knife before the alleged mugging.
   ``This case is going to try the City of New York,'' Lutwin said
outside the courtroom. ``It's going to try the city because we're
going to see if we can get a fair and just trial despite the fact
that my client has already been convicted in the media.''
   All eight suspects, who range in age from 18 to 22, were
arraigned on second-degree murder and first-degree robbery charges.
   The next court date was set for Oct. 3 before Justice Edwin
Torres.

   Everyone agrees this city is in deep fiscal
trouble. Everyone disagrees on what to do about it.
   Philadelphia faces a $206 million deficit by June 30, the end of
the fiscal year, and Wall Street has turned up its nose at
short-term notes to keep the city's bills paid through May.
   On Friday, Mayor W. Wilson Goode announced a hiring freeze and
delays in pension fund payments and tax refunds, freeing up $122
million. But the city still expects to go broke by Dec. 1.
   ``If Philadelphia has even a temporary period without sufficient
cash, the result will be a legal, political and public safety
nightmare,'' Finance Director Betsy C. Reveal said in a recent memo
to Goode.
   Political and business leaders are calling for a consensus, but
state elections this year and next year's city elections seem to
have stifled creativity.
   No invited city or state officials joined a Greater Philadelphia
Chamber of Commerce summit on the crisis last week, except Goode
and the city's elected controller, Jonathan A. Saidel. Several
elected officials, including Gov. Robert P. Casey, sent
representatives.
   ``The only consensus you can get out of people in an election
year is that `it's not my fault, it's his fault,''' Saidel said at
an earlier luncheon with business and community leaders.
   Saidel, a lawyer and accountant, said that when he first learned
city officials wanted to borrow a half-billion dollars to keep the
city afloat until May, he asked what permanent solution they had in
mind.
   ``They told me that they didn't have a plan,'' he said. ``In the
end I decided it was not good public policy in Philadelphia to
borrow this money. I believed it was forestalling an inevitable
decline in Philadelphia and forestalling the cash problem doesn't
solve anybody's problem.''
   In any case, the city earlier this month couldn't find banks to
guarantee the notes, and Wall Street showed little interest.
Bond-rating services now rate Philadelphia's $1.3 billion in
outstanding debt as risky as junk bonds.
   Few taxes can be raised or added without state approval. The
wage tax already is nearly 5 percent for city residents and 4.3
percent for commuters, among the highest rates in the nation. The
City Council spurned Goode's request last spring to raise wage
taxes on city residents to 5.5 percent. That would have raised
$58.8 million a year, officials said.
   Philadelphia hasn't levied a sales tax since the early 1930s. A
proposal to impose a half-cent tax on top of the state's 6 percent
tax was passed by the City Council but awaits action in
election-wary Harrisburg. The increase would raise $45 million a
year, officials say.
   Budget cuts are another option, but many expenses are locked in
by long-term labor contracts. ``I'm not convinced that they can
solve this problem by cuts alone,'' said Colleen Woodell, a vice
president for Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York.
   City Councilman James J. Tayoun proposed a financial oversight
board similar to one that helped New York City avoid bankruptcy in
the 1970s.
   Councilman David Cohen urged withdrawal of city deposits from
four local banks that refused to back loan notes.
   Organized labor also weighed in. A coalition of unions
representing 60,000 city workers recommended closing tax loopholes,
adding cigarette and unearned-income taxes and imposing a services
fee on suburban residents.
   Goode had warned for years that the city's finances were shaky,
saying in 1989 a tax increase was needed to avoid a $305 million
deficit by mid-1991.
   Several tax increases he has proposed have stalled in the City
Council or the Legislature. State voters rejected a tax reform
measure in 1989 that would have given Philadelphia an option for a
sales tax.
   And there seems to be no mandate for any major change.
   ``I don't sense that the great majority of folk in Philadelphia
yet realize the seriousness of the problem,'' said John B. Neff,
president of Frankford Hospital. ``So long as they're not
personally affected by it - inertia's a wonderful thing - it could
go on forever.''

   The government on Monday lifted a

former military regime for its alleged Marxist content.
   The new civilian government said its decree was necessary
``because the nation has started a time of real implementation of
the principles of democracy and freedom.''
   It was not immediately known whether Fiddler on the Roof will be
shown soon in movie houses in Chile. The government of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet imposed the ban in 1974.

   Members of the Air Force's 1st Tactical
Fighter Wing don't have to worry about satisfying a sweet tooth
while on duty in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The guys tell me, `We're cookied out,' '' said Sgt. Dana
Flores, a spokeswoman for the wing stationed at Langley Air Force
Base in Hampton.
   Americans have opened their hearts - and their baking ovens - to
military personnel involved in Operation Desert Shield.
   Among the offerings: 3,500 peanut butter cookies baked by the 14
nuns of the Monastery of Poor Clare. The nuns said many of the
airmen deployed last month have volunteered to help around the
monastery.
   Ms. Flores is responsible for seeing that donations from the
public get to the wing while it is stationed overseas. Sometimes
that means not sending everything that comes in, she said,
especially if the offering could clash with Saudi culture.
   ``What people might not realize is that our troops are working
side-by-side with the Saudis. One of our people might put down a
book and a Saudi pick it up and read it and perhaps be deeply
offended by some part. It could lead to an incident,'' she said.
   So Ms. Flores has been going through the thousands of donated
paperbacks, weeding out those that might be a problem. The books
are judged by their covers, suspected contents and author.
   ``The Saudi culture is a very religious one with very serious
proscriptions against alcohol, pork and what is perceived as
pornography,'' said Mary Anne Tetreault, an associate professor of
political science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk.
   ``Anything of a political nature, especially anything to do with
Israel, is also banned,'' said Ms. Tetreault, who has spent several
years in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Ms. Flores has had to discard numerous paperbacks whose covers
are adorned with women wearing racy outfits. Magazines, especially
those with sexually suggestive advertisements, are another
headache, Ms. Flores said.
   ``One young lady tried to send a pair of lacy panties to her
man. I'm afraid that just won't get through Saudi customs,'' she
said.
   However, packages sent to sailors and Marines aboard ships
stationed in the Red Sea or Persian Gulf do not have to go through
Saudi customs, said Major Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Navy's
Atlantic Fleet.
   The Air Force has been flying donated supplies to the fighter
wing as space allows, Ms. Flores said.
   Johnston said the Navy has been encouraging people interested in
sending things to the troops to write directly to them.
   ``When you're overseas, you're always looking for a letter from
home, even if you don't know the person who sent it. I know from
personal experience what an empty feeling mail call can be when you
don't get anything,'' he said.
   Johnston recommends a small set of checkers or chess, a deck of
cards or science fiction or western paperbacks for the Navy men and
women.
   However, Ms. Flores asked that no more paperbacks be sent for
the airmen. ``We're covered up in books right now. ... What they
are asking for is drink mixes ... anything powder they can mix with
the water. Drinking straight water is apparently getting pretty
boring.''
   Talcum powder, sports equipment and personal hygiene items also
are appreciated, Ms. Flores said.

   Federal health officials are collaborating
with several hundred physicians in the United States and Canada to
gather more information about the progression of the infection that
leads to AIDS.
   The study will give medical researchers a better picture of
which symptoms and diseases are most common in different groups of
patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
which causes AIDS, officials said in announcing the study Monday.
   It also will provide information on what treatments patients are
using and will help researchers identify medical changes that occur
as HIV infection progresses towards acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
study was expected to ``result in the most comprehensive collection
of information on HIV-infected persons amassed in the history of
the AIDS epidemic.''
   Patient confidentiality will be protected, he added.
   ``The more information we have about HIV-infected persons, the
faster we can advance our AIDS research,'' said HHS Assistant
Secretary for Health James Mason.
   The study will allow researchers to compile a data base on a
broad spectrum of HIV patients and will help physicians identify
patients who can participate in clinical trials of experimental
drugs, officials said.
   More than 30 community-based clinics and programs in the United
States and Canada will participate in the study. They include 18
sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases and 15 sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
   Several hundred physicians will be able to enroll patients they
see at these clinics and programs, as well as patients they see in
their private practices. These physicians care for more than 60,000
HIV-infected patients, according to the research foundation.
   Every three to six months during a regular clinic visit,
physicians will ask all patients in the study a set of questions
about their health and the drugs they are taking.

   At least 900 American men, women and children
are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, the State Department said today as
it again accused Saddam Hussein's government of barbarism.
   At least 93 of these U.S. hostages, including many with serious
medical problems, have been detained by the Iraqi government. Nine
were seized over the weekend, one as he tried to board what could
be the last evacuation flight sanctioned by Baghdad.
   Most of the adult male Americans in Iraq and Kuwait are in
hiding, said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman. For the sake of their safety she declined to provide
exact figures.
   More than 1,900 American citizens and their foreign-born family
members have been evacuated from the two Persian Gulf countries
since Iraq seized Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Remaining behind, Ms. Tutwiler said, are 600 to 700 American
citizens in Kuwait and 300 to 350 in Iraq.
   ``We find it particularly deplorable that the Iraqis have not
only ignored our request to evacuate Americans with serious medical
problems, but are now beginning to detain them,'' the U.S. official
said.
   She called the detention of sick people, some of them with
terminal illnesses, ``barbaric.''
   Iraq has said it was using American men as human shields to
deter a U.S. attack on oil refineries and other strategic
installations.
   President Bush and senior U.S. officials have not ruled out
force as a means of compelling Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait.
Basically, however, the administrttion is hoping an embargo on
Iraqi commerce authorized by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6
will prompt him to relent.
   On Sunday, the Iraqi leader threatened to attack Saudi Arabia,
other Arab countries and Israel if Iraq was ``strangled'' by the
economic sanctions.
   Ms. Tutwiler called it ``another outlandish, outrageous
statement.''
   And yet, she said, ``we have not seen any responsible statement
towards doing what the world is saying he must do, which is
withdraw from Kuwait and let the restoration of the legitimate
government in Kuwait go back.''

   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield has not found much
to laugh about in his bitter court battle with Caesars Palace, the
hotel where he headlined until an alleged steam room accident 2{
years ago.
   Dangerfield filed a $5 million lawsuit against his former
employer after Caesars balked at paying him for shows he missed
following the alleged accident in March of 1988.
   Testimony was scheduled to resume today. Closing arguments were
scheduled for Tuesday.
   Each side blames the other for eye problems the comedian claims
he suffered from a burst of steam from a faulty steam bath
mechanism. Caesars contends the injuries were a figment of a
``comedic imagination.''
   If Dangerfield was looking for respect, he found little of it in
the two-week trial before U.S. District Judge Roger Foley.
   Dangerfield, 68, was portrayed as a vindictive, foul-mouthed
malingerer by Caesars attorneys, who raked both the comedian and
his case over the coals.
   ``You're trying to make me out to be a liar and I'm not,''
Dangerfield said at one point during three days of combative
testimony.
   Dangerfield testified he was wronged by Caesars executives, who
didn't fully believe he was injured by the steam. The comedian
skipped four performances, claiming his eyes were too sensitive to
light to perform. After returning for two shows, he walked offstage
without performing on closing night, miffed at Caesars for wanting
to defer his $45,000-per-show pay for the nights he missed.
   ``I just couldn't be funny for these people,'' said Dangerfield,
who advised the showroom crowd of 1,200 to get refunds for both
their seats and for any tips they gave showroom workers.
   Caesars, in an effort to prove Dangerfield wasn't hurt as badly
as he claimed, introduced evidence showing Dangerfield went to the
fights one night he was to perform, and to see a comedy show
another night. A doctor who examined him following the steam bath
incident said he thought Dangerfield could perform.
   Eye specialists testified Dangerfield had eye problems since the
mid-1970s and may have hurt himself further by his repeated use of
a topical anaesthetic used in surgery on his eyes.

   A gunman who opened fire at a passing

Monday by police, authorities said.
   The man's grandmother, who also was in the house, was rescued
unhurt, police said.
   The trouble began shortly after midnight when Clifford Gordon
Keeling, 31, fired at a car, said police Sgt. Pat Kolstad.
   The motorist fled and Keeling retreated to his house, Kolstad
said. The sergeant said police surrounded the house and tried to
negotiate, but Keeling disconnected his telephone and refused to
talk.
   A SWAT team entered the house around dawn and used two explosive
charges to distract Keeling, Kolstad said. The sergeant said the
man was shot when he confronted the officers, but declined to say
if Keeling fired on the officers.

<HEAD>Governors Say States Will Have to Take Lead in Health-Care Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States will be forced to take the lead in
fighting spiraling health-care costs because Congress isn't likely
to act soon, leaders of a national governors' conference said
Monday
   ``The problem is becoming so severe that if we don't steer
ourselves toward a solution, the problem is going to steer us
toward bankruptcy,'' said Nevada Gov. Bob Miller.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, chairman of the National
Governors' Association, said he was optimistic the states would
handle the problem ``because we have no choice.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said the governors want to
determine why the United States is wasting money on health care.
   ``This country is spending twice as much on health care as West
Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan or France,'' Dukakis said. ``And
25 percent to 30 percent again as much as Canada. Yet, those
countries provide quality health care and we don't.
   ``We have to understand whey we are spending twice as much for
less,'' he said.
   Gardner said Congress was unlikely to legislate a health care
program for several years, but that states are addressing the
problem because of state-budget shortfalls.
   ``Health care is analogous to the Pac Man of state government,''
he said. ``It is consuming a greater and greater share of state
government.''

   Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, which have
prompted obscenity charges against a Cincinnati art gallery and its
director, are getting a far warmer reception here.
   A top AIDS research lab plans to honor its namesake at a benefit
next month, and attempts to shut down an exhibition of
Mapplethorpe's photographs in Boston fizzled weeks ago.
   Jury selection began Monday in the trial of director Dennis
Barrie and the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, where the
seven-week exhibit was shown last spring to record crowds.
   Friends and family of Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March
1989, will gather Oct. 4 to launch a fund-raising campaign for The
Robert Mapplethorpe Laboratory for AIDS Research at New England
Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
   The hospital is hoping to raise $1.5 million to expand and
renovate its AIDS research lab.
   ``I'm finding people are focusing on AIDS research and treatment
as opposed to the controversy surrounding the exhibit,'' said
benefit coordinator Tom Egan.
   The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, which funds AIDS research
and photography projects, gave a $300,000 grant to the hospital in
March. Mapplethorpe died at age 42 while being treated at
Deaconess, a Harvard teaching hospital.
   Physicians at Deaconess are trying to identify new drugs to
treat AIDS, which exposes the body to infection by crippling its
immune system.
   ``I think the research is something that a lot of people want to
support - the whole idea of a cure or a treatment in the future,''
said Egan. ``It's very long-term oriented.''
   The fund-raiser will coincide with the final showing of ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'' at Boston's Institute of
Contemporary Art.
   Boston Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three
complaints early this month against the exhibit, which would have
prompted an investigation by the district attorney.
   Although the exhibit was canceled at the Corcoran Art Gallery in
Washington, D.C., because of a furor over government funding for
the National Endowment for the Arts, it has appeared in several
other cities without incident.

   Maverick GOP gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret on Monday called for armed vigilantes to battle crime in
New York City.
   ``What I really want is a vigilante system with people carrying
guns, unknown to anybody,'' said Rinfret, ``so anybody who comes
along and mugs somebody may have, standing next to him, a man who's
been authorized.''
   Aides later said the Manhattan-based economist envisioned a
volunteer corps of up to 100,000 police-trained vigilantes.
   A spokesman for Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, Rinfret's opponent
in the November election, dismissed the proposal as dangerous.
   ``Every law enforcement official in the world would agree that
his idea is absurd and irresponsible,'' said James Flateau, Cuomo's
chief spokesman on criminal justice issues.
   Rinfret is trailing Cuomo badly in opinion polls and has been
getting little financial support from Republican leaders.

<HEAD>Four More Students Burn Themselves to Protest Job Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four people including a teen-ager set
themselves ablaze Monday in growing violence over the government's
plan to set aside nearly half of its jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   Police hurled tear gas shells to disperse a mob near Parliament,
and police headquarters in the capital was besieged for three hours
by rampaging students who burned government vehicles, buildings and
train coaches.
   United News of India said Prime Minister V.P. Singh asked
Communications Minister Janeshwar Mishra and a senior party leader,
S.R. Bommai, to open talks with the students to explain the job
policy.
   But Singh must rescind the policy before they will talk, said
the students, who claim the job quotas amount to reverse
discrimination against upper-caste people.
   In New Delhi, Surinder Singh Chauhan, 22, doused himself with
gasoline from a motorcycle in the midst of thousands of students
and set himself on fire with a match, witnesses said.
   Kamal Kishore Sharma, who rushed to Chauhan's aid, said: ``We
were sitting under the tent when we saw a ball of black smoke ...
and caught the stench of burning flesh.''
   Safdarjang Hospital's acting chief, Dr. B. Chakravarty, said
Chauhan suffered burns over his entire body and had ``no chance of
survival.''
   A doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity that an
18-year-old was admitted to another New Delhi hospital with burns
over 70 percent of his body.
   Two other people attempted self-immolation in Jaipur, a town 180
miles southwest of New Delhi, United News of India said. Both were
treated for third-degree burns, it said.
   The traffic intersection where Chauhan set himself afire has
been taken over since Thursday by thousands of students.
   At least 25 people have been killed in street battles with
police since Wednesday, and scores of students have attempted
suicide by burning to protest the new government job policy.
   The government employs 18 million people nationwide, and Singh
announced on Aug. 7 that 49 percent of the prized jobs will be
reserved for people of low castes, who have been suppressed for
years by India's rigid social system. In that past, 22.5 percent of
the jobs had been set aside for low castes and native tribes.
   Under the new policy, another 5 percent to 10 percent of
government jobs will be reserved for the poor, regardless of caste.
   A doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity that an
18-year-old was admitted to another New Delhi hospital with burns
over 70 percent of his body.
   Two other people attempted self-immolation in Jaipur, a town 180
miles southwest of New Delhi, United News of India said. Both were
treated for third-degree burns, it said.
   Student leaders Sunday vowed not to lift the siege of the road
intersection, one of New Delhi's busiest, ``even if we have to face
military bullets.''
   A tent tied to traffic signals and lampposts is the nerve
center. Street fences are ripped out and thrown across the streets
to block traffic.
   Despite growing student opposition to the job quotas, no
political party has announced support for or opposition to the
policy.
   Political analysts say the issue cannot threaten Singh's
minority government unless it gains the support of an established
political group.
   This is unlikely because political parties fear alienating the
low castes, which comprise more than 50 percent of India's 880
million people, the analysts say.
   Many opponents of the job program say it is aimed at securing
votes rather than rendering social justice.
   Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the population, are divided
into four castes and hundreds of sub-castes, which decide a
person's social standing.
   Discrimination on the basis of caste is illegal, but in practice
the system permeates much of Indian social life, especially in
villages.

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil goes before a judge
Tuesday in Denver for a rare public hearing that could lead to his
being barred from working for a bank or savings and loan.
   Federal regulators have accused Bush, 35, of conflict of
interest in his former role as a director of Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that failed in late
1988 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The hearing before an administrative law judge is the
centerpiece of the government's complex proceeding against Bush,
which has taken the form of a paperwork battle since the Office of
Thrift Supervision filed the charges in February.
   The OTS is seeking an order against Bush, an oil and gas
developer, to effectively bar him from working for a bank or a
savings and loan. The agency contends that Bush failed to
adequately disclose to Silverado his business relationships with
developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters, two big borrowers
from Silverado who defaulted on their loans.
   Bush could have avoided a public hearing by agreeing not to
dispute the conflict-of-interest charges, as other S&amp;L officials
have done in nearly all such previous cases. By fighting the
government, he has taken the case out of attorneys' and regulators'
offices into a public forum.
   ``The swords are drawn,'' Bush's attorney, James Nesland, said
recently.
   Bush plans to testify in his own defense at the hearing, which
is expected to continue through most of the week.
   Although such a public hearing is almost unprecedented, the
participants don't expect any fireworks or courtroom drama. In
fact, Nesland said, ``This is going to be an extraordinarily boring
hearing.''
   That's because it will mainly be a replay of written testimony
already submitted to the administrative law judge, Daniel J.
Davidson. Regulators and outside experts will be cross-examined on
that testimony by attorneys for the two sides.
   The judge won't issue an opinion for some time and the
government isn't expected to issue a ruling in the case until
spring.
   Earlier this year, five other former directors and officers of
Silverado, including former chairman Michael R. Wise and loan
officer Russell Murray, agreed not to dispute the OTS'
administrative charges against them.
   Bush also faces a separate $200 million lawsuit filed last week
against him and other Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. The civil suit accuses the directors, including
Bush, of ``gross negligence'' that contributed to Silverado's
collapse.
   Since he appeared in May before a congressional committee
investigating Silverado's collapse, Bush's fight with the
regulators has consisted mostly of briefs and counterbriefs
submitted to Davidson.
   Now regulators, journalists and Davidson himself have trekked
from Washington to Denver, Bush's home turf, for the hearing
starting Tuesday in a federal courtroom. The hearing before
Davidson is being held in Denver because the now-defunct Silverado
was based there.
   Bush is scheduled to be the final witness of 11 - eight for the
government and three for Bush.
   Davidson is expected to make his recommendation by Dec. 6 to OTS
Director Timothy Ryan.
   The law judge could recommend that the regulators' proposed
cease-and-desist order against Bush be issued, or he could advise
against it. The order would bar Bush from engaging in future
actions that would involve a conflict of interest.
   Davidson also could recommend a stronger prohibition order, OTS
Chief Counsel Harris Weinstein said last week.
   The cease-and-desist order proposed by OTS would stop short of
banning Bush from the financial institutions industry, but could
impose strict conditions on his holding such a job. A prohibition
order would be an ``absolute bar,'' Weinstein said.
   A draft internal document written earlier this year by OTS staff
members recommended that a prohibition order also be issued against
Bush. But the thrift agency later found there wasn't sufficient
evidence to support a prohibition and the less serious
cease-and-desist order was proposed, an OTS spokesman has said.
   Under the administrative timetable, Ryan would make his decision
by April 8. Bush would have the right to appeal the decision, most
likely to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the governing Socialist
Party resigned Monday under pressure from reformers, mounting
social tensions and Bulgaria's economic crisis.
   Alexander Lilov, a member of the Politburo under ousted
Communist hard-liner Todor Zhivkov, said he was stepping down in
favor of a ``more pragmatic'' leader.
   Several members of the former Communist hierarchy who helped
engineer Zhivkov's ouster last November have since had to
relinquish senior posts.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov, 52, is the only senior Communist from
the Zhivkov era who still holds a top state post.
   The Communists renamed themselves the Socialists last spring and
went on to win June's first free elections in 58 years with 211
seats in the 400-seat parliament.
   Since then, however, their popularity has declined as Bulgaria's
economic crisis has worsened. Basic foods such as sugar and cooking
oil are rationed, and power is cut regularly.
   The Socialists were forced to end weeks of deadlock over who
should become state president by agreeing to the election of Zhelyu
Zhelev, leader of the democratic opposition, in August.
   But political tension continued to mount. An angry crowd
attacked, burned and looted the Socialist Party headquarters on
Aug. 26.
   That attack reportedly was provoked by the Socialists' refusal
to remove a red star from its headquarters. On Monday, the congress
voted to remove all such symbols of the communist era from party
buildings nationwide and adopted a new emblem - a white rose on red
background - and new flag.
   Lilov, 57, became party leader only last February. Knowledgeable
Bulgarians say he has split, rather than united, the party.
   The party congress decided Monday that a new leader would be
chosen by the whole congress, and not just the party's council, a
leadership body with about 150 members. The election was expected
late Monday or early Tuesday.
   In announcing his decision to step down, Lilov cited his links
with the now disgraced Zhivkov regime as one factor.
   ``I have the responsibility for the time during which I was a
Politburo member of this party ... for more than ten years,'' he
told delegates.
   ``We are still not a new party, which thinks, analyses and acts
from a new position,'' Lilov said. ``Perhaps we are tired after
holding power for over 45 years.''
   ``The party needs a leader who is worthier and more pragmatic
than I am - in short, a better leader,'' he said.
   Lukanov on Sunday identified four reformers as possible
successors to Lilov.
   They were Dragan Draganov, Alexander Tomov, Petar Emil Mitev and
Asen Zhablensky. All belong to reform factions and none is
associated with the Zhivkov era.
   Lilov served as chief ideologist of the Communist Party until
being dropped from the leadership by Zhivkov in 1983. He rejoined
the top ranks after Zhivkov's ouster.
   Former President Petar Mladenov and former Defense Minister
Dobri Dzhurov also lost their government posts this summer, despite
having engineered the Communist Party coup against Zhivkov in
November.
   In heated weekend debates at the congress, the leaders of four
reform factions in the party called for a new, younger leadership.
   ``If no radical changes are made, there will be a gradual
disintegration of the party,'' Draganov said Sunday.

<HEAD>Sentencing Hearing Starts for Cult Leader's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys on Monday urged a
jury to spare the life of a cult leader's son who was convicted in
connection with the ritualistic killing of a family of five.
   Damon Lundgren, 19, was found guilty Tuesday on four counts each
of aggravated murder and kidnapping in the April 17, 1989, shooting
deaths of Dennis Avery and his three young daughters. He was
acquitted in the kidnapping and murder of Avery's wife, Cheryl.
   Lundgren's father, Jeffrey, who describes himself as a prophet,
was sentenced to death last week following his conviction on five
counts of aggravated murder and kidnapping.
   Jeffrey Lundgren has admitted to actually shooting the family,
but Ohio law allows prosecution of someone who participates in a
killing, even if he didn't directly cause the death.
   The same Lake County Common Pleas jury that convicted Damon
Lundgren began hearing testimony Monday in a proceeding to decide
his penalty. The jury's choices are the death penalty, life in
prison with parole eligibility after 30 years, or life with parole
eligibility after 20 years.
   Damon Lundgren's attorneys argue that he was coerced into the
crime by his father.
   ``Damon's undoing was that he honored and obeyed his father,''
defense attorney Charles Cichocki said. ``And for that, he should
not be put to death.''
   The Averys' bodies were found in January buried under a barn at
a cult farm about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Each of the Averys
had been bound and gagged with duct tape, then shot and dumped in a
common grave.
   At his sentencing hearing, Jeffrey Lundgren called himself a
prophet. He said he considered the Averys, also members of the
cult, to be faltering in the sect's beliefs.
   He said he found messages in the Bible and other Scriptures
telling him the Averys should die.
   His wife, Alice, received five life sentences for conspiracy,
complicity and kidnapping roles in the Avery deaths.
   Other cult members await trials or have pleaded guilty to
reduced charges.

   A freight train derailed near downtown
early Monday, spilling a small amount of a caustic chemical and
blocking traffic during the morning rush hour.
   Eight cars of the CSX train cars overturned about 4:30 a.m.
   One tanker leaked about five gallons of sodium hydroxide. Fire
Battalion Chief Mark Devine said the spill of the caustic liquid,
which he likened to drain cleaner, was not believed to be
hazardous.
   Ohio 315 - the only major north-south highway in the city not
clogged by construction - remained closed until 9 a.m. while
hazardous-materials officials determined that chlorine gas in two
of the overturned tanker cars was not leaking.
   One of several warehouses in the area was closed for the day as
a precaution.
   One firefighter was treated for injuries suffered when he slid
down an embankment, and one was taken to a hospital because of
heart problems, Devine said.

   A herd of elephants blocked rail tracks
for several hours after a passenger train knocked down and killed
an elephant calf Monday, United News of India reported.
   Elephants roaming in the surrounding forests came rushing after
they heard the calf's cries and sat around its body on the tracks,
the news agency said.
   After futile attempts to dislodge the animals, the crew took
back the train to its origin, Mettupalayam, 1,162 miles south of
New Delhi in southern India, UNI said.
   The train was on its way to Ootacmund, a popular hill resort in
the Nilgiri mountains, 18 miles away.
   UNI quoted the railways as saying that ``the calf was killed as
it suddenly appeared on the tracks.''
   Train service between Mettupalayam and Ootacmund was affected
for more than 12 hours, UNI reported but did not say when the
elephants left the site.

it must shut down group nurseries for abandoned infants by the end

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the tradition of the tall-masted clipper ships
that once raced across the oceans, two sailors are taking aim at a
136-year-old record this fall in a San Francisco-to-Boston sweep
around treacherous Cape Horn.
   Skipper Richard Wilson, who has suffered from asthma most of his
life, says he's in it to raise money for lung research and to find
out what happens ``when you're cold and wet and tired and scared
... and you've got another 24 hours to go.''
   Wilson and Steve Pettengill will be shooting for the record of
76 days, 6 hours set by the clipper Northern Light, which roared
into Boston Harbor in 1853 loaded with animal hides, copper, silk
and fruit.
   Oct. 22 is the tentative departure date for the 14,000-mile trip
on the 60-foot trimaran ``Great American.''
   ``If we don't beat it then the experience will still be
extraordinary. I don't think there's anything else like this in
sport,'' Wilson said. ``We won't stop and there aren't any repair
ships along the way.
   ``There aren't any substitutes coming off the bench when you get
tired. There aren't any timeouts.''
   Gale-force wind, seas over 100 feet and stretches of agonizing
calm are likely in store for the 2{-month trip, Wilson said.
   ``I'm certain we'll have some horrendous weather. One of the
great challenges is to just keep going, day in and day out,'' he
said.
   To raise money for the cost of the expedition and for the
American Lung Association, which has named Wilson one of its
``SuperAchievers,'' the two will make daily progress reports
accessible by calling 1-900-820-BOAT. Calls cost $3.50.
   Several attempts in recent years to beat the times of the old
speedy skippers are tribute to the continued fascination modern-day
sailors have for the graceful clipper ships that ruled the seas
from about 1840 to 1870.
   The clipper captains were motivated by the financial rewards of
rushing supplies out to gold-rich California or whisking fragrant
teas and spices back from the Orient to get the best price before a
competitor reached port.
   Today, the lure of the long, grueling trips is the challenge of
beating the elements, said Rich Boehmer, who keeps track of sailing
records at his Sail Performance Center in West Bridgewater.
   ``They're extremely competitive people. That's how they feel
that they can becomeknown,'' he said.
   Once begun, the life of a long-distance sailor is hard to
relinquish, Boehmer said.
   ``People that do those kind of the things - the rest of your
life is boring,'' he said.
   Wilson, 40, said he got the idea for the record attempt after
sailing in a single-handed trans-Atlantic race in 1988.
   ``I thought that was the greatest experience I ever had, but
somehow there (had) to be a way to extend the benefit to other
folks,'' he said.
   Wilson, who taught school briefly in Boston, is a participant in
the Student Ocean Challenge Program, and will visit schools before
and after his trip to talk about geography, history and seagoing
life.
   Pettengill is from Grand Rapids, Mich.
   The voyage did not draw a corporate sponsor, and Wilson said he
hopes to convince the public that there is more to yachting
endeavors than the America's Cup races every four years.
   He said the San Francisco-Boston trip probably won't be his last
crack at the record books.
   ``You get great satisfaction. You get a great experience that
you can't get on land. You gain knowledge, you gain confidence, you
get in tremendous physical shape. You get a lot of things,'' he
said.

   The Supreme Soviet legislature voted Monday to
move toward a Western-style market economy and gave President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sweeping new powers to make the switch.
   Despite warnings by some lawmakers that the special powers would
make Gorbachev a virtual monarch, the legislature passed a
resolution allowing him to issue decrees on property, wages,
prices, the national budget, the financial system, and law and
order.
   Gorbachev promised to exercise the powers with care.
   ``It's a responsibility,'' he told the legislature. ``It's not a
tea party.''
   After rancorous debate, the lawmakers were unable to agree on a
specific, step-by-step program to move away from the central
planning system that they blame for technological backwardness and
shortages of housing, food and consumer goods.
   Instead of choosing one of the three plans presented in the past
two weeks, the Supreme Soviet set up a committee to combine them
and report back by Oct. 15.
   Despite disagreement on how to make the switch, the Supreme
Soviet's vote marked the first time it has committed the country to
a market-based system and was a departure from seven decades of
Communist economics.
   Since the 1920s, ministries in Moscow have kept a tight grip on
the economy, issuing detailed five-year plans that told thousands
of factories, farms and businesses what to produce, where to sell
it and how much to charge.
   The most radical reform proposal, written by economist Stanislav
Shatalin, calls for junking the central planning system and moving
to a market economy within 500 days by selling factories to private
owners and breaking up collective farms.
   The most conservative proposal, backed by Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, would leave the government in control of most of the
economy while moving gradually to allow free enterprise.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of
the 500-day plan but would not move as fast. He also wants a
national referendum to decide whether to return land to private
farmers.
   Before and during theSupreme Soviet's meeting, protesters
gathered outside the Kremlin and at Pushkin Square in downtown
Moscow to condemn the decision to give the president additional
powers. They said Gorbachev did not deserve such authority because
he was not elected by direct vote of the people.
   ``The people don't trust Gorbachev!'' shouted a group of
demonstrators outside the Kremlin's Spassky Gate. They held signs
saying, ``A President - Not an Emperor'' and ``All Decrees of the
President are Battles Against Democracy.''
   Gorbachev was elected to a five-year term as president by the
Supreme Soviet in March. Previously, his power had come from his
position as general secretary of the Communist Party, which he has
held since 1985.
   The legislature voted 305-46, with 41 abstentions, to allow
Gorbachev the special powers until March 31, 1992. The time limit
was intended to cover a 500-day economic reform plan, should one be
approved.
   The action put the Supreme Soviet on a collision course with the
parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the Soviet
Union's 15 constituent republics.
   On Saturday, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and other leaders
of the Russian parliament declared that Gorbachev's request for
additional power was ``unacceptable'' because it would allow him to
infringe on the republic's sovereignty.
   The Russian parliament has adopted Shatalin's 500-day plan and
threatened to put it into effect on its own.
   The Supreme Soviet was ambiguous about the extent to which it
will review Gorbachev's decisions. Its resolution said he would
have the right to issue urgent decrees ``if the Supreme Soviet does
not find it necessary to establish other rules, or does not
recommend that the president change or replace his decisions.''
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a lawyer, objected to the word
``recommend'' and urged the legislature to adopt clearer language
requiring its review and approval of all presidential economic
decrees. But his amendment was defeated on a vote of 211-94 with 70
abstentions.
   Another legislator from Leningrad, Yuri Boldyrev, complained the
resolution gave Gorbachev ``absolutely unlimited powers,'' and a
lawmaker who did not identify himself told the legislature it would
make the president into a ``monarch.''
   But the legislature rejected a series of amendments designed to
limit the president's new powers.
   Ryzhkov, the prime minister, later told reporters there was ``no
possibility that Gorbachev will become a dictator.''
   ``Gorbachev is the first really parliamentary leader in
Russia,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
today was ordered to stand trial on a second corruption charge
involving gas contracts and alleged nepotism.
   A special one-judge court ruled that the army-backed caretaker
government presented enough evidence to indict the former premier
and set a trial date of Oct. 9.
   Ms. Bhutto is accused of canceling lucrative contracts for the
distribution of liquified gas and giving them to friends and
relatives.
   Justice Rashid Aziz Khan ruled there was enough evidence for a
trial.
   On Sunday, he ordered Ms. Bhutto, 37, to stand trial on Oct. 2
on another corruption charge, this one involving the alleged
illegal sale of government-owned land to a company owned by a
cousin.
   If convicted of either charge, Ms. Bhutto could be barred from
the Oct. 24 elections and from participating in politics for up to
seven years.
   She was not immediately available for comment. Her aides said
she had been locked in meetings with lawyers at her fortress-like
home in Karachi since Sunday's ruling.
   One of her lawyers, however, said he was confident the
government would not be able to substantiate the charges.
   The lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Bhutto
had not decided whether she would appear before the tribunals but
hinted that she probably would.
   Legal experts say Ms. Bhutto could be tried in absentia and held
in contempt of court, possibly facing a fine or arrest.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, using his constitutional powers,
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government on Aug. 6 on charges
of corruption, political incompetence and abuse of power.
   The caretaker government has filed four corruption charges - two
in Lahore and two in her hometown of Karachi. The Karachi charges
still are pending.
   Ms. Bhutto won election in November 1988 and became the first
woman to lead a modern Moslem nation.
   She now is a candidate for five seats in the 217-member National
Assembly, the law-making lower house of Parliament. Her aides say
Ms. Bhutto ran for more than one post in case she is disqualified
from one seat.
   Since her dismissal, Ms. Bhutto's military-backed opponents have
begun a campaign to portray her administration as the most corrupt
in Pakistan's 43-year history.
   But several Pakistani and foreign diplomats have criticized the
special tribunals hearing the charges as one-sided.

   Changes in interest rates on short-term
Treasury securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.32 percent, down from 7.39 percent
last week. Another $9.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.33 percent, up from 7.30 percent last
week.
   The rate for three-month bills was the lowest since they were
sold for 7.23 percent on Aug. 6. The rate for six-month bills was
the highest since they averaged 7.34 percent on Sept. 10.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.56 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,815.00 and 7.72 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,629.40.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.77
percent last week, up from 7.75 percent the previous week.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   ---
   The United Nations General Assembly session opened with
condemnations of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. French President
Francois Mitterrand called Iraq a warlike state whose aggression
could lead to anarchy. Other leaders, including Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and President Bush, are to speak in
coming days.
   ---
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would fight for ``a
thousand years'' to keep Kuwait, and said the United States was the
real aggressor in the region. The official Iraqi News Agency said
he made his remarks to a group of Islamic clerics.
   ---
   Oil prices soared as high as $38 per barrel and gasoline and
home heating oil both topped $1 a gallon. Light sweet crude was
trading Monday on the futures market at $37.75 per barrel for
November contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil sold
above the $37 mark for the first time since the crude futures began
trading on the exchange in 1983. At one point, it hit $38 for a
record price.
   ---
   Iraq said Monday it had rebuffed an offer from the United States
to allow an Iraqi Airways plane to land in New York - if Baghdad
releases more than 1,000 Americans being held in Iraq and Kuwait.
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, has so far stayed away from
the U.N. General Assembly, saying he will not follow U.S. advice to
take a commercial flight instead.
   ---
   Israel responded Monday to threats made by Iraq a day earlier.
Baghdad had said Israel would be a target if the gulf crisis came
to all-out war. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israelis were
ready to ``confront, prevent and ... defend ourselves'' against
Iraq.
   ---
   The International Monetary Fund approved an accelerated effort
to supply billions of dollars to help countries hurt by the embargo
against Iraq. In a communique on Monday, the IMF's policy-making
interim committee directed the staff of the international lending
agency to ``respond on an expedited basis to present difficulties''
of such countries, including Iraq's former major trading partners.
   ---
   Iraq tightened its grip on Kuwait by abolishing the country's
currency, the dinar, and replacing it with Iraqi dinars. The Iraqi
currency is not convertible on the international market.
   ---
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Syrian
President Hafez Assad was extending his stay in Tehran. Assad,
Saddam's arch-enemy, came to Iran for talks that were to include
inquiries about the Western hostages in Lebanon and Iran's
intentions regarding the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq. Assad met
for the third time in three days Monday with Rafsanjani.

<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund gave its
support Monday to an accelerated effort to supply billions of
dollars to poor countries harmed by the Persian Gulf crisis as the
Bush administration worked behind the scenes to flesh out details
of the assistance package.
   The approval by the IMF's policy-making interim committee was
announced in a communique that stressed the international lending
agency would respond on an ``expedited basis to present
difficulties.''
   The IMF approval followed promises by World Bank President
Barber Conable that his agency stood ready to increase its lending
as a result of the Mideast turmoil.
   The Bush administration is counting on both the IMF and the
World Bank to provide significant support to bolster the trade
embargo against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In addition, President Bush earlier this month dispatched
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III on global fundraising missions seeking pledges of support
from individual countries.
   So far, the administration has received commitments of $20
billion divided equally between support for the U.S. military
buildup in the Mideast and assistance for the so-called front line
states of Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
   The administration is concerned that the trade embargo against
Iraq will not succeed without significant aid flowing to countries
harmed economically either by the loss of export markets or a jump
in oil prices.
   The IMF communique provided no specifics on how much money would
be forthcoming but did list a variety of IMF programs that could be
tapped for money including a compensatory fund used in the past to
aid nations hit by earthquakes and hurricanes.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, the chairman of the
IMF interim committee, denied that the lack of specifics reflected
any dissension among the 22 finance ministers who spent Sunday and
early Monday crafting the IMF policy.
   ``We recognized the urgency of the needs of the people who are
affected,'' Wilson told reporters. ``The urgency is stated, the
framework is provided and now it is up to the IMF management to
respond.''
   Echoing remarks made by Conable last week, IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus said he believed the emergency aid could start
flowing early in 1991.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has become the central focus of the
annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, being attended by
representatives of the 152 nations that are members of the two
institutions. President Bush was scheduled to address the finance
officials on Tuesday.
   The administration held a series of meetings behind the scenes
Monday in an effort to tie up loose ends of the financing packages.
   Treasury Department aides were meeting with representatives from
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and the 12-nation European
Community in an effort to reach agreement on financing details.
   These working-group meetings were to be followed on Wednesday
with discussions at a higher level led by Treasury Undersecretary
David Mulford.
   Horst Koehler, an official in the West Germany Finance Ministry,
said that the discussions were being held to settle on an exact
dollar amount of required assistance. But U.S. officials said the
talks were covering a broader range of issues including the
mechanisms to be used to funnel the aid to needy countries.
   Just three weeks ago, the administration said it wanted to raise
$10.5 billion to meet the needs of Egypt, Jordan and Turkey through
the end of next year. However, U.S. officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Monday that the range now being
considered was 12 billion to $14 billion in economic assistance to
the three front-line nations with changing economic circumstances
such as higher oil prices blamed for the revised figure.
   In addition to this assistance, the United States is also
seeking billions of dollars in additional contributions to other
countries hurt by the jump in oil prices.
   Nations mentioned for this group include the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe, which are about to lose their access
to cut-rate oil from the Soviet Union, as well as such Third World
countries as the Philippines, India and Brazil.

   Syrian President Hafez Assad held his
third meeting in three days with President Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Monday after extending his visit to Tehran, the official Iranian
news agency said.
   Assad's talks are believed to have focused on Iran's role in the
United Nations embargo against Iraq, and on the plight of 13
Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency provided no details about Assad
and Rafsanjani's latest meeting.
   Assad, who arrived in Tehran Saturday for what was to have been
a three-day visit, decided to stay longer than scheduled ``due to
the importance of the issues under discussion and the need to
complete consultations,'' IRNA said.
   Assad is Iran's key Arab ally and an archrival of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.
   His visit to Tehran followed talks with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in Damascus earlier this month. Washington apparently
wants Assad to use the leverage he gained from supporting Iran
during its eight-year war with Iraq on the hostage and embargo
isses.
   Tehran has hinted that it would allow ``humanitarian shipments''
of food and medical supplies into Iraq regardless of the embargo,
imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover
of Kuwait.
   However, IRNA reported Monday that Iranian authorities had
arrested 29 smugglers accused of trying to move foodstuffs across
the border into Iraq to circumvent the U.N. embargo.
   Iran has criticized the invasion of Kuwait. But it also has
deplored the U.S.-led Western forces deployed in Saudi Arabia and
the region.
   Assad has stressed to the Iranians that the U.S. military
presence in the Persian Gulf is not permanent and that it would end
if Saddam relinquished Kuwait.
   Assad himself sent some 4,000 troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia, and has pledged to send
another 15,000 men.
   Iraq abruptly moved to make peace with Iran after the invasion
of Kuwait. The move freed up Iraqi troops that had occupied Iranian
border areas since fighting ended in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   Diplomats in Damascus and Tehran have said the plight of the 13
Western hostages in Lebanon is a main topic on Assad's agenda in
Tehran.
   Most of the six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an
Italian, are held by Shiite Moslem factions linked to the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God. It is Tehran's main ally
in Lebanon, where Syria is the major power broker.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Five Measures Not Eligible for Ballot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five statewide voter initiatives, including a
far-reaching proposal to allow tax credits for church-sponsored
schools, aren't eligible to be on the Nov. 6 ballot, a judge ruled
Monday.
   Marion County Circuit Judge Richard Barber's ruling could lead
to removal of all eight initiatives from the ballot.
   Because of printing deadlines, Barber said the measures could
stay on the ballot but that votes for or against could not be
counted.
   Barber said the proposals no longer qualify for the ballot
because they won't be accompanied by financial impact statements as
required by state law.
   The measures would limit property taxes, shut down the Trojan
nuclear plant, ban some non-recyclable packaging, establish a pilot
work in lieu of welfare program and allow tax credits for sending
children to private schools.
   The school funding measure would grant state income tax credits
of up to $2,500 a year for pupils at private schools, including
church-supported schools, and for children taught at home. It also
would allow parents to send their children across district lines to
any public school.
   Barber's decision was an outgrowth of earlier Marion County
Circuit Court rulings that the fiscal statements couldn't appear on
the ballot because they weren't certified by state officials by a
legal deadline.
   Barber said the Legislature intended that measures not appear on
the ballot without the required statements of financial effects.
   State officials were considering an appeal of Monday's ruling.

<HEAD>Deficit, at Record Level in August, Could Ease by Fiscal Year's
End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit jumped $52.8
billion to a record $241.7 billion in August, but could be reduced
before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, the Treasury Department
reported Monday.
   The 67 percent surge over the comparable 11 months of 1989
boosted the spending imbalance well over the record of $221.1
billion posted in fiscal 1986. The August total, however, fell
short of the one-month record of $53.3 billion set last March.
   ``We used to have years that were that bad,'' economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said of the August deficit.
   The department said about $25 billion of the August deficit
reflected a shift of payments normally made in September such as
military pay and Social Security checks to the previous month to
avoid Labor Day weekend delays.
   ``This will affect September's results by $25 billion as
compared to last year,'' it said in a statement.
   Still, without the $25 billion early payment, the deficit so far
this fiscal year would have totaled $216.9 billion. The deficit in
September 1989 was $6.1 billion.
   The Bush administration had forecast a $218.5 billion imbalance
for all of fiscal 1990.
   White House and congressional negotiators are trying to reach
agreement on reducing the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 and $500 billion over the next five years.
   Without an agreement, the White House estimates the fiscal 1991
deficit will total $232.3 billion.
   Revenues in August totaled $78.5 billion, up 3.1 percent from
the comparable month in 1989. But the receipts were offset by
$131.2 billion in outlays, a 33.5 percent gain over August 1989.
   In addition to the early payments, the spending bill included
$2.6 billion for the Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency
charged with bailing out the savings and loan industry. The S&amp;L
bailout cost $3.2 billion in July and $37.8 billion so far this
year.
   The government hopes to regain much of the bailout cost by
selling real estate, loans, securities and other assets from failed
thrifts. That would help reduce the deficit in future years.
   ``It's just a continuation of the trends we've been seeing,''
Steinberg said. ``Receipts are not that strong because the economy
is weakening.''
   Revenues for the first 11 months totaled $928.6 billion, up 4.2
percent from the first 11 months of last year. Spending during the
period totaled $1.2 trillion, 12.8 percent over the comparable
period of 1989.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were the military,
Social Security and other programs of the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $27.8 billion in August and $269.2
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $290.2 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $41.2 billion for the month
and $244.2 billion for the year. They are projected to total $244.9
billion for the year.
   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$18.3 billion in August and $179.7 billion for 1990 so far. They
are projected to total $192.4 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $18.9 billion for the
month and $247.6 billion so far this year. Such interest is
projected to total $261.1 billion for the entire year.

   While their leaders hedged and debated an economic
rescue plan, Soviet consumers have lost patience with dwindling
supplies of even basic goods such as bread, cigarettes, matches and
paper.
   Last week, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev admitted the Soviet
Union had run out of time as well.
   ``We must move and act,'' Gorbachev scolded legislators Friday
when they failed to muster a quorum to act on economic reform.
``Don't wait.''
   After months of indecision over what path to take, the Soviet
parliament voted Monday to accept in principle a plan to move to a
free market economy and reject central planning.
   But the journey Soviet officials have taken to the market this
year has been a slow one, with reverses and setbacks.
   In the spring, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov drew up an
economic reform plan that called for continued central planning, a
strong central government and a slow transition to the market. But
it was quickly rejected by the parliament and returned to him for
reworking. Its call for doubling and tripling prices on some basic
consumer goods also set off a wave of panic buying.
   When Ryzhkov's reworked plan was submitted to lawmakers earlier
this month, it was criticized as little different than the
original.
   A radical plan drawn up by economist Stanislav Shatalin also was
submitted to parliament this month. It proposes a 500-day
transition that includes sovereignty for the 15 Soviet republics,
sale of state property to private owners, decollectivization of
farming, land reform, cutting the military and KGB budgets, and
deregulating most prices while freezing the costs of 150 essential
goods.
   The Shatalin plan was passed by the parliament of the Russian
Republic - the nation's largest political subdivision - on Sept.
11.
   A committee appointed by Gorbachev then put together a
compromise that has many elements of Shatalin's plan but rejects
some key provisions, including those on decollectivization and
sovereignty for the republics.
   While the various proposals have been hammered out, things have
worsened. Gorbachev himself says the nation has entered an
``economic depression,'' and frustrated shoppers have become more
agitated.
   After an acute shortage of cigarettes all summer, the nation's
smokers began to register their anger with demonstrations and
strikes. They began in the smaller cities of the Russian republic
and spread to Leningrad and Moscow, where protesters blocked the
streets until truckloads of cigarettes arrived.
   Hundreds of people demanding better supplies of food, tobacco,
alcohol and consumer goods rioted in the Ural Mountains city of
Chelyabinsk in August.
   Bread rationing was instituted in one city near Moscow at the
end of the summer, and the capital's supplies of the traditionally
plentiful Russian staple ran short for about two weeks.
   ``We are sick and tired of empty shops and devalued money; we
want no more crises,'' Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, an opponent of
Gorbachev's, told thousands of people rallying at the Kremlin on
Sept. 16.
   Factories and farms in some cities suffering through shortages
have refused to ship their goods to other cities or republics.
   Ryzhkov went on nationwide television Sunday night and told of a
``very serious'' shortfall in the current harvest of potatoes and
other vegetables, with only a third of the crop collected. Such a
warning is ominous as the nation prepares for winter.
   But even Monday's first step toward the market was not without
disagreement, debate and further delay.
   The economic blueprints before lawmakers will be merged into one
plan by a committee of legislators and economists by Oct. 15, a
further wait of three weeks.

   Disorderly conduct charges were dismissed Monday
against recording artist Bobby Brown, who was arrested after he
intervened in a restaurant confrontation between his brother and a
police officer.
   Court officials said neither Brown nor his brother, Tommy Brown,
29, attended the hearing before Municipal Court Judge Howard
Johnson. Tommy Brown was scheduled to appear in court Oct. 9.
   Bobby Brown's attorney, Paul Howard, said the singer was ``very
embarrassed to be associated with an incident that caused him to
have to come into contact with the criminal justice system in this
way.''
   Brown, 23, and his brother were arrested early Sunday at the
Beautiful Restaurant in southwest Atlanta. According to police, the
elder Brown had been arguing with another man, then cursed and
threatened a police officer when the officer tried to calm him.
   ``Bobby Brown apparently attempted to intercede on behalf of his
brother and complained about the officer's treatment of his
brother,'' said police Sgt. R.G. Christian. ``The officer felt he
was interfering with his duties, and he charged both men with
disorderly conduct.''
   Brown's 1988 solo album, ``Don't Be Cruel,'' sold more than 5
million copies. He has a house in Atlanta.

   Several people have been detained on suspicion of
killing a prominent Russian Orthodox priest whose grisly slaying
provoked national outrage, Tass reported Monday.
   Father Alexander Menn, a writer who was persecuted under
previous Soviet leaders for his evangelical activities, was
bludgeoned to death with an ax while on his way to church Sept. 9
near his house in Zagorsk, 50 miles northeast of Moscow.
   The 55-year-old priest bled to death from the blow, authorities
said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who noted Menn's death in
the national parliament, has demanded a ``thorough investigation''
of the slaying.
   The official Tass news agency, without quoting any sources by
name, said in a brief report it had learned ``several'' peoptained on suspicion
of killing Menn.
   The case is being investigated by the le have
been deInterior Ministry of the
Russian republic, Tass said, under a unit headed by Deputy Interior
Minister Vyacheslav Pankin.
   After his death, Menn was praised by the government newspaper
Izvestia as a ``pastor to many human rights champions, prisoners of
conscience, those persecuted by the authorities.''
   A theologian and a church historian, Menn wrote several books
and articles, as well as a children's book. His popular history of
comparative religion was publishedan hour last Tuesday.
   Hogan said that because of the two major summer blackouts, the
media is reporting minor problems that previously would have been
ignored.
   Edison has blamed the West Side blackouts on a problem at a
generating plant, and other failures on damaged cables and animals
chewing power lines.
   Still, Hogan said Edison maintains ``a 99.98 percent reliability
factor.''
   ``We don't have any reason to believe the total infrastructure
is in jeopardy,'' Hogan said.
   Even so, the Daley administration insists a buyout is a real
alternative.
   ``This is not a bargaining chip,'' Daley spokeswoman Carolyn
Grisko said Friday. ``This is a possibility.''
   The current agreement gives the city the right to purchase Comm
Ed's system within the city's limits - an option first given
serious consideration in 1985 under the late Mayor Harold
Washington's administration.
   But other issues besides the buyout are on the table, including
how much money the utility pays the city for the right to operate
here. Currently, the utility pays Chicago 4 percent of its gross
receipts - which last year was in excess of $72 million, Hogan
said.
   Consumer groups, such as Citizens Utility Board, are asking the
city to consider a new franchise that would require Commonwealth
Edison to work harder to cut customer costs.
   Residential Commonwealth Edison customers paid 10.7 cents per
kilowatt hour for electricity in 1988, compared with a national
average of 7.5 cents, according to the power association.
   Edison financial analysts say the utility also has a lot to lose
in the talks.
   Chicago represents ``a large portion of the company's sales,''
said Linda Byus, a utility analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
Its image also is linked closely to the city, which may help forge
an amicable agreement between the two, she said.

<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda, surrendering to
opposition demands, said Monday he would clear the way for
multiparty elections after almost two decades of one-party rule.
   Zambia is the latest of several African nations to move toward
multiparty elections following popular demonstrations against
authoritarian regimes founded mainly on Eastern European models.
   Kaunda told top ruling party officials he was recommending
constitutional amendments that would allow other political parties
to contest parliamentary and presidential elections next year.
   He said he was also asking his United National Independence
Party to scrap a referendum scheduled for next August on Zambia's
political future.
   Instead, the party will campaign against opposition parties in
elections for 150 seats in parliament, he said.
   Opening a five-day meeting of the party's top policy-making
body, a 600-member council, Kaunda also called for a new
constitution permitting more than one candidate to run for the
presidency and creating the post of vice president for the first
time.
   He told the council he was confident his party would win free
elections.
   ``I am more than ready to lead UNIP in an election against any
party or parties in this country. We are not afraid,'' he said.
   Kaunda, 66, established a one-party state in this southern
African nation in 1973, nine years after leading the former British
colony of Northern Rhodesia to independence as Zambia.
   After food riots and violent anti-government demonstrations
earlier this year, Kaunda acknowledged the need for political
reforms in Zambia, one of Africa's poorest nations.
   A pro-democracy opposition group was legalized in July to
campaign for a vote on whether to return to a Western-style
multiparty system. The Movement for Multiparty Democracy attracted
to its rallies the largest crowds in Zambia's political history.

   Winnie Mandela and seven
former associates will stand trial in February on charges of
kidnapping and assaulting four young men, a magistrate decided
Monday.
   The wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
stood silently during her arraignment in the Protea magistrate's
court in Soweto. Dozens of supporters chanted her name and danced
outside the building.
   Also on Monday, police found six bodies of young men along
railroad tracks between Johannesburg and Soweto black township. All
bore multiple injuries, indicating the victims may have jumped or
been thrown from a train, police Capt. Eugene Opperman told the
South African Press Association.
   More than two dozen people have died in attacks on trains in the
Johannesburg area in recent weeks.
   The charges against Mrs. Mandela stem from a December 1988
incident in which 14-year-old Stompei Seipei as killed. The former
head of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, has been
convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the case.
   During Richardson's trial, the other three victims testified
they were abducted by members of the Mandela United Football Club -
Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards - and taken to her Soweto home. They said
Mrs. Mandela beat them with a whip, and the others also assaulted
them.
   Mrs. Mandela and the other defendants face four counts each of
kidnapping and four of assault with intent to commit grievous
bodily harm.
   She has denied any wrongdoing. She was freed on her own
recognizance. The other seven defendants, former members of the
now-disbanded club, had their bail continued.
   If convicted, Mrs. Mandela could face anything from the death
sentence to a suspended sentence for kidnapping, lawyers said. The
death sentence has never been imposed for kidnapping in South
Africa, they said.
   Her lawyer, Ismail Ayob, argued Monday that the original Oct. 30
trial date gave Mrs. Mandela insufficient time to prepare.
Magistrate T.F. Veldman set a new date of Feb. 4.
   Dressed in a conservative dark suit, Mrs. Mandela and her
husband walked hand in hand through dozens of ANC supporters to
enter the building.
   After the hearing, the crowd chanted ``Winnie! Winnie!'' when
they came outside. Neither made a statement to a pack of waiting
reporters.
   White and black leaders fear the trial will strain relations
between the ANC and the government as the sides try to start talks
on ending apartheid.
   Monday's arraignment was the latest in a series of controversial
or damaging incidents involving Mrs. Mandela. Many have been linked
to the soccer club she formed and that served as her protection.
   The two dozen teen-agers played few matches and were accused of
terrorizing the Soweto neighborhood where Mrs. Mandela lived.
   According to testimony at Richardson's trial, Mrs. Mandela's
bodyguards accused Seipei of being a police informer and the other
three victims of having homosexual relations with the white
minister at their church home.
   No evidence has been presented that Seipei was a police spy. The
Methodist Church cleared the minister of any misconduct.
   In other developments Monday:
   -Police said at least 12 people died nationwide in black
factional fighting over the weekend. About 800 people have been
killed in the violence, which erupted Aug. 12 in black townships
around Johannesburg.
   -Protests mounted against 9 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfews scheduled to
begin Tuesday night in some townships. The ANC has said the curfews
would leave blacks defenseless against vigilante attacks.
   -Soweto officials signed an agreement to end a five-year rent
boycott in the sprawling township of 2 million people southwest of
Johannesburg.
   The protest was against living conditions and the local
authorities, considered to be linked to the white-led government.
   Under the agreement, more than $200 million owed by the
residents would be written off. Residents would pay $10 a month in
rent, plus a metered electricity charge.

   Helmut Kohl, who will lead a united
Germany within two weeks, on Monday dismissed claims he is too busy
with unification to become seriously involved in global affairs
such as the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In a meeting with the AP board of directors, Kohl maintained
that German unity will ``release fresh energies'' for assisting
Third World nations and for helping maintain world peace.
   ``The Germans are by no means preoccupied only with their own
affairs,'' Kohl said in a written statement prepared for The
Associated Press.
   The West German chancellor also answered AP board members'
questions, elaborating on many of the same themes, but said his
comments during the meeting were not for publication.
   Kohl becomes chancellor of all Germany when the East and West
unite on Oct. 3. He stands a good chance of being re-elected on
Dec. 2, the date of the first all-German elections in 57 years.
   Kohl spoke with the AP board of directors for nearly two hours
at the Chancellery.
   He released a written statement to the board containing his
latest views on a united Germany's role in world politics and other
matters.
   Many of Kohl's remarks focused on the global responsibilities of
a united Germany and how they mesh with the political integration
of Europe as a whole.
   The chancellor expressed deep gratitude to President Bush for
being the first Western leader to affirm the Germans' right to
unify.
   ``I wish to single out in particular the contribution made by
the United States of America,'' Kohl said.
   He also said he and Bush are both interested in seeing serious
economic reform succeed in the Soviet Union. The Germans have
committed themselves to providing large sums of money to help out
the Soviets.
   ``A successful outcome to these reforms serves us all,'' he
said.
   Kohl, destined to go into the history books as the architect of
German unity, rejected charges by his political rivals that he
rushed unification to advance his own career. He said the East
Germans determined the pace.
   Kohl said a mammoth challenge lies ahead because the German
nations followed drastically different paths after their separation
four decades ago.
   Germans will have to ``show great empathy and understanding in
order to overcome both the physical and the mental divisions
between us,'' he said.
   People in the impoverished East cannot ``expect us to create
equal standards of living'' for them overnight, Kohl added.
   He rebuffed criticism from some U.S. congressmen and officials
in other nations that the Germans don't want serious global
responsibilities.
   The accusations were made after West Germany said its
constitution barred it from sending soldiers to assist the U.S.-led
multinational forces deployed in the Persian Gulf after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Since then, West Germany has promised a large financial package
to help in the gulf crisis.
   Kohl argued that his policies do have global implications.
   For example, Kohl said, he is committed to the political union
of Europe.
   ``We are striving for tangible progress towards a common
external and security policy'' within the 12-nation European
Economic Community, he said in his statement.
   He said a united Germany would not seek the ``leading role in
Europe'' but intends to ``live up to our responsibility in Europe
and in the world.''
   ``My government will therefore continue to support the
international efforts to curb Iraq's policy of expansion and to
restore the territorial integrity of Kuwait,'' he said.
   ``The unification of Germany and its commitments in a changing
Europe will not prompt us to neglect problems in other parts of the
world,'' Kohl said. ``On the contrary, German unification will
release fresh energies.''
   ``In the long run Germany and Europe as a whole will possess
additional resources for contributing to economic and social
development in the Third World and to the safeguarding of peace
worldwide,'' he added.

   Iraq, underscoring its control over
Kuwait, has declared Kuwait's currency invalid and set a deadline
for all who hold it to exchange it for Iraqi money, the government
said Monday.
   Iraq will reimburse those who possess Kuwaiti dinars with Iraqi
dinars on a 1-for-1 basis, the government said. Those who hold
Kuwaiti dinars have until Oct. 6 to exchange it for Iraqi currency,
said the announcement, carried by state Iraqi News Agency.
   After that date, Kuwaiti dinars will be considered worthless,
the Baghdad government said.
   Iraq has methodically dismantled Kuwaiti institutions following
its Aug. 2 invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Iraqi authorities
have officially disbanded Kuwait's government, military and
national airline, and call Kuwait Iraq's 19th province.
   The currency measure was taken ``to facilitate transactions
throughout Iraq and ending duality in the monetary dealing,'' the
government said.
   Before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered his army into
Kuwait, one Iraqi dinar was worth $3.22 and one Kuwaiti dinar
traded at $3.45 at official rates.
   But the Kuwaiti currency was convertible on international
markets while the Iraq dinar was not. The Iraqi currency remains
inconvertible.
   The decision was also expected to eliminate the black market for
the Kuwaiti dinar. Although the Iraqi dinar's official value
remains the same, its value to buy goods or foreign currency on the
black market was about one-tenth the official rate. Iraq punishes
currency smugglers with death.
   In the first days of the invasion, the Kuwaiti dinar fell from
$3.45 to about one-fifth its value before international currency
exchanges suspended trading of the Kuwaiti currency.
   ``No banks will accept to quote or trade either Iraqi or Kuwaiti
dinars,'' a Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur official said
Monday. That would be forbidden under the freeze on Kuwaiti and
Iraqi assets adopted by France and the other European Community
countries, the Paris-based official said in an interview.
   He said even if there were no economic embargo, no one would
trade the Kuwaiti dinar because there is no longer any central bank
to guarantee its value. Anyone with Kuwaiti dinars outside the
country would effectively be holding useless paper, the banker
said.
   There are exceptions in extremely limited circumstances.
Kuwaitis stranded in London can go to the National Bank of Kuwait
or United Bank of Kuwait and get British pounds for their dinars if
they have dinar accounts there and can prove that they are in
desperate need of funds, according to a financial source in
Bahrain.
   The Banque Misr, or Bank of Egypt, in Cairo has not been
instructed to stop accepting the Kuwaiti dinar, an official of the
bank's foreign exchange department said. The currency was quoted in
Monday's fixtures as usual, though at $2.86.
   When the crisis erupted, the Egyptian-Saudi Finance Bank allowed
Kuwaitis to exchange 500 dinars at the old rate for two days. Any
other funds had to be exchanged at the reduced rate.
   The practice appeared part of the exile aid program run by the
Kuwaiti government, itself in exile in Saudi Arabia, the financial
source in Bahrain said.
   Certain local banks may have been given a guarantee by Kuwaiti
embassies allowing them to exchange dinars to needy Kuwaiti
citizens, the source said.
   But it would be impossible for the Kuwaiti government-in-exile
to honor all dinars, because Iraq could then try to convert the
huge stocks of Kuwaiti cash its soldiers plundered during the
invasion, the source noted.
   The fall of Kuwait made instant paupers out of tens of thousands
of people with assets in Kuwait or Kuwaiti currency.
   H. Zahreddin, a wealthy Lebanese businessman doing business in
Kuwait, flew home to Lebanon the day before Iraq overran Kuwait to
throw a lavish wedding party for his daughter at a plush Beirut
hotel.
   ``I went to bed a millionaire and woke up in debt,'' Zahreddin
said later. ``The hotel refused to accept my Kuwaiti dinar check to
settle the bill.''

   A woman who playfully asked her husband for
a piggyback ride fell 18 stories to her death from a balcony after
standing on a chair to climb on his back, authorities said Monday.
   The chair tipped and Cindy McNeely, 32, of Woodstock, Ga., went
over the railing Saturday night at Sundestin Condominiums in this
Florida Panhandle resort town, said Rick Hord, a spokesman for the
Okaloosa County Sheriff's Department.
   Her death has been ruled an accident pending an autopsy, Hord
said. He said investigators have no reason to doubt the account
given by her husband, Richard McNeely, also 32, a certified public
accountant.
   They had put their three children, girls 6 and 4 and an
18-month-old son, to bed before going out on the balcony, Hord
said. After about 20 minutes they decided to go in.
   McNeely told investigators his wife then suggested that he carry
her in on his back and climbed on the chair, Hord said.

<HEAD>`The Civil War' Hits Big in Overnight Nielsen Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratings for ``The Civil War,'' the 11{-hour,
landmark documentary playing this week on public television, were
the highest for a series debut on the Public Broadecasting Service,
PBS said Monday.
   The two-hour premiere, ``The Cause: 1861'' scored an average 9.0
rating and a 13 share in the A.C. Nielsen Co. overnight sample of
24 markets. In addition, the debut earned an 11.2 rating and 16
share in the top four markets.
   ``This is equivalent to an estimated national audience of 13.9
million people,'' PBS said.
   ``Any time PBS gets into double figures is very impressive,''
said John Marks, an analyst for the J. Walter Thompson advertising
agency. He said the 24-market sample would be more representative
of the series' nationwide average.
   ``Cosmos,'' PBS' previous top-rated debut, averaged a 9.1 rating
and a 13 share in 1980, and was sampled only in the top four: New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, the public television
network said.
   Each rating point equals 931,000 homes. A share is the
percentage of television sets in use tuned to a show in its time
period.
   ``The Civil War,'' by filmmaker Ken Burns, is being broadcast in
2{-hour seqments on consecutive nights through Thursday. The series
will be rerun in January and July 1991, PBS said.

<HEAD>Capital Has Treatment Slots For Less than 1 Percent of Drug
Abusers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia has room for less
than 1 percent of its drug abusers in its comprehensive city-run
treatment programs, according to a study released Monday.
   ``This study shows that the city has not waged a war on drugs,''
said Emanuel Chatman, an accounting professor at the University of
the District of Columbia, who compiled the report with two fellow
UDC professors.
   ``The city is woefully behind on the treatment end of the
equation, and the commander in chief has not been in charge,''
Chatman said.
   The report - which also predicted that the city will set another
homicide record this year - comes less than two months after Mayor
Marion Barry was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession
charge. In the weeks following Barry's arrest on drug charges in
January, the mayor enrolled in private substance abuse treatment
centers in Florida and South Carolina.
   City officials have estimated that there are 76,000 drug abusers
in the nation's capital.
   But there are only 460 beds available in city run drug-treatment
centers, plus 700 more in post-recovery, or relapse, treatment
centers, the study found.
   ``Given the number of drug addicts, the number of beds for
detoxification is extremely small,'' said Ann Hughes, an urban
studies professor who also worked on the 18-month survey of 37
city-run programs.
   The report also says that of the $500 million city officials say
is being spent to fight drugs in the district, treatment programs
receive just $10.3 million.
   ``It is clear that our priorities need to be reversed,'' said
UDC political science professor Joseph Drew. ``Money for this
should be considered from the other $490 million being spent in the
war on drugs.''
   The researchers predicted that if the current homicide rate
continues, the city will have 471 murders in 1990, compared with
438 last year.
   Through Sept. 22 this year, the city had suffered 342 homicides,
compared with 325 at the same time last year. Police blame drugs,
particularly turf battles among crack cocaine dealers, for more
than 60 percent of these killings.
   The study recommended that the city establish minimum standards
for prevention and education and do a better job of publicizing
available services.
   The report was based on unannounced visits paid to city drug
clinics.
   ``We wanted to surprise them, to keep them from cleaning up
their acts and getting ready for us,'' said Hughes.
   Annette Jones, who chairs the mayor's advisory committee on drug
abuse, said Barry had reviewed and accepted the group's
conclusions.

   Two white supremacists who say the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf is a scheme to protect Israel's
interests were arrested for allegedly burning an Israeli flag,
police said.
   Matt Hale and Steven Thornhill, both of East Peoria, were
arrested Sunday for investigation of creating a bonfire on a public
sidewalk. They were freed on $50 bond each and ordered to appear in
Tazewell County Circuit Court on Oct. 18.
   Hale, 19, a Bradley University student who has tried to form a
white supremacy group on the campus, contended the United States is
using Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait to protect Israeli
interests.
   ``We oppose white people dying for rich Jewish bankers,'' he
said as a small group of protesters waved an American flag and
shouted racist slogans.
   The two men and four other members of the American White
Supremacist Party went to Pekin to demonstrate after they were told
they'd be arrested in nearby Peoria if they burned Israel's flag
there.

<TEXT>
   A low-flying B-1 bomber
struck three birds, cracking its two windshields and obscuring the
crew's view so badly they had to be talked through a landing.
   The bomber, assigned to the 28th Bombardment Wing's 77th Bomb
Squadron at Ellsworth, was flying 610 mph about 1,000 feet off the
ground at night on Sept. 19 when it hit the birds over northern
Montana.
   The plane's commander, Capt. Paul Dow, said Monday he assumes
the birds were ducks. ``For September, we're starting to move into
a heavy migratory period of migratory fowl,'' he said.
   After the impact last week, Dow took the craft up to 17,000 feet
to make sure it didn't hit anything.
   Because of the many cracks in the layers of plastic, ``There
really wasn't any way we could see out at all,'' Dow said.
   The impact also broke a utility light in the cockpit, causing
sparks.
   Landing conditions at Ellsworth were bad because of rain and low
clouds.
   The instructor pilot, Maj. Tom Owskey, had to take over the
controls because he had the best view.
   Ground crews directed the landing by radio.
   The broken windscreens were ``reflecting three or four different
runways,'' Owskey said. ``I basically had to be talked down - to
the left or right of the center line - and I was maneuvering to
make a safe approach.''
   It was the first time the crew of four had flown together.
   ``They obviously did a great job, when you think what they had
to handle,'' said wing commander Col. Ron Henderson. ``They were
very calm throughout the entire emergency. Everybody was.
   ``It was a team effort on the ground, with a lot of people
involved.''

   Rescue workers searched collapsed
low-income homes Monday for more victims of flash floods that left
at least 45 dead, the Red Cross said. At least 30 others were
missing.
   ``There are still more dead,'' said Alfonso Magallanes
Contreras, a Red Cross paramedic and rescuer.
   More than 5,000 people were left homeless by the weekend storm,
the worst to hit the northwestern city in 90 years, authorities
said. More than 5 inches of rain had fallen since Saturday, and the
rain continued Monday.
   Gov. Fernando Baeza Melendez declared an emergency in and around
Chihuahua, the state capital, which was hardest hit by the flash
floods, which on Sunday thundered down gullies and a normally
nearly dry river that cuts through the mountain city.
   ``This tragedy that brought mourning to many Chihuahua families
will be a mark in history. But we will know how to act. We are
going to provide all the help needed to those who have lost their
homes,'' Baeza Melendez said.
   Rescue workers estimated about 240,000 people in the city of
about 600,000 were virtually without water, power or telephones.
Sewers in many areas were overflowing, posing health hazards.
   Baeza Melendez said that of the 45 victims, 32 had been
identified.
   More than 350 homes were destroyed, and 1,000 more were damaged,
Baeza Melendez said.
   ``Some homes disappeared completely by the floodwaters from one
of the streams,'' Red Cross radio dispatcher Heriberto Perez said
in a telephone interview.
   In the Colonia Villa neighborhood alone, on the north side of
the city, more than 150 houses collapsed, a report from the
governor's office said. About 300 automobiles and other vehicles
were also wrecked by the flood.
   ``A state of alert has been declared, but everything is quiet,''
Perez said, adding that in some places, the water was between 3
feet to 9 feet deep.

   A carbide oven exploded at a chemical
plant in Transylvania on Monday, killing five people and injuring
10, state radio said.
   Two of the injured were reported in critical condition.
   Experts ruled out sabotage and said early findings indicated the
explosion in Tirnaveni, 240 miles north of the capital, was
probably caused by a mixture of air and carbon monoxide gases that
collected near the furnace.
   The blast came as the furnace was being prepared for operation
after five weeks of routine maintenance checks, the radio quoted
sources at the plant as saying.
   It said damage could total $1 million.
   The government later called urgently for a law to form a special
military corps to guard important industrial plants nationwide, the
state news agency Rompres reported.
   However, the decision seemed to arise from increased pilfering
at state-owned works. Government officials have indicated that the
theft of spare parts or damage to plants during break-ins could
lead to major industrial accidents like Monday's.
   The explosion was the third in wwo months at chemical plants in
Transylvania, but a government statement said the number of
industrial accidents was half of last year's.

<HEAD>Angola To Allow Food Deliveries To The Hungry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what U.S. officials are describing as a
breakthrough, the Angolan government has agreed to allow ``the
prompt and efficient delivery'' of food supplies to tens of
thousands of Angolans who face starvation because of drought.
   The Bush administration's expert on foreign disaster relief,
Andrew Natsios, revealed Monday the Angolan commitment that had
been made in a joint statement U.S. and Angolan officials agreed to
last Wednesday.
   Angolan officials had snubbed Natsios in Luanda two weeks ago,
but the leftist government apparently then underwent a change of
heart.
   Last week, Natsios met with Angolan Gen. Antonio Dos Santos
Ndalu at an undisclosed location and received assurances of the
Angolan government's willingness to allow relief supplies under
United Nations auspices to reach hungry Angolans both in
government- and rebel-held territory.
   A civil war has raged in Angola since 1976, and the United
States has provided aid to the UNITA rebel group since 1986.
   Natsios told reporters he saw the effects of the drought during
a visit to the affected areas. At one location, he saw children who
had eaten only two or three meals in a week. At another village,
five children had had only mice to eat in the preceding days.
   He described the Angolan commitment as a breakthrough but said
he would withhold further judgment until the plan is implemented.
   Angolan officials have said that 2 million people live in the
drought-affected area. UNITA officials have indicated that the
number of hungry Angolans could be 750,000.
   Natsios said a more precise estimate of the number of Angolans
whose lives are at risk would have to await a report by a U.N.
assessment team.
   The U.S.-Angolan statement said the two sides ``agreed on the
need for prompt and efficient delivery of relief supplies to all
affected populations in Angola. The U.S. side reiterated its
commitment to join with other donors in the U.N.-led effort to
provide the necessary assistance to Angola.''
   Angola has been wary about outside food aid because of concern
that the United States might try to use food shipments as a cover
for weapons earmarked for anti-communist rebels.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said the Angolan
government may be showing flexibility on the humanitarian aid issue
to influence pending congressional deliberations about future aid
to UNITA. The Angolan government strongly opposes such aid.
   The communique also said the Angolan side advised the U.S. side
that relief supplies would be allowed to enter Angola ``from
neighboring states by the fastest and most efficient routes.''
   The Namibian government has agreed to let food shipments be sent
to Angola through its territory. Another possibility is deliveries
through Zimbabwe, which has a food surplus, Natsios said.

<TEXT>
   A minister and two church members accused
of trying to ``beat the devil'' out a depressed man have been
convicted on false imprisonment charges.
   The Rev. James D. Price, pastor of the First Assembly of God
Church, returned to the pulpit Sunday - two days after his
conviction - cried and called his trial a ``time of storm.''
   Price, 42, was convicted Friday by a State District Court jury
in Hondo along with Robert L. Nixon Jr., 43, and Alvin R. Nixon,
32, who are brothers. All are from Devine, 30 miles southwest of
San Antonio.
   They are to be sentenced Oct. 29.
   Evertt ``Ray'' Weimers, 44, also from Devine, testified the
three restrained and beat him last January as part of a religious
rite, scratching and bruising his face and separating his right
shoulder.
   Dr. Ricardo Castillo, who treated Weimers, testified the victim
was depressed and confided to Price about marital and financial
problems.
   ``The preacher told him the reason he was feeling that way was
that he had the devil in him and needed to be exorcised,'' Castillo
said. ``Then the preacher went to get some more parishioners to
beat it out of his system.''
   During his sermon Sunday, Price said ``we hold nothing against
anyone, the judge, Mr. Weimers, anyone.''
   Several church members said they support their pastor.
   ``I haven't seen him (Price) do anything improper,'' said church
member Mary Craig.
   The three face a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in prison
and $5,000 fines.
   ``I don't think it will go that far. The judge was shocked,''
said Mrs. Craig. ``He couldn't understand why the verdict went that
way.''

   What do Dr. Seuss, Stephen King and the editors
of Webster's dictionary have in common? Theirs are among the scores
of books banned or challenged in the past year, the American
Library Association said Monday in launching Banned Books Week.
   ``We need to bring to the attention of American public the fact
that our First Amendment rights are under attack,'' said Judith
Krug, director of the association's Office for Intellectual
Freedom.
   A Webster's Dictionary edition was challenged in the Upper
Pittsgrove Township, N.J., school district because parents objected
to the definition of sexual intercourse as ``the sexual joining of
two individuals,'' said Paul Whitman, secretary of the school
board.
   The 1986 dictionary - an edition edited especially for
teen-agers - was removed from fourth and fifth grade classrooms
last fall, but continues to be used in upper levels, he said.
Whitman said he didn't know what portion of the definition provoked
the challenge.
   ``The Lorax'' by Dr. Seuss' was challenged in a Laytonville,
Calif., school district last September. Parents working for a local
logging company said the book portrayed their industry negatively.
   The book remained on the second-grade required reading list
after the challenge, but teachers voluntarily moved it to an
optional list the following spring, said Superintendent Brian
Buckley.
   Stephen King's ``The Stand'' was restricted to ninth-grade
students with parental consent at Whitford Intermediate School in
Beaverton, Ore. after some parents objected to violence and sexual
language. And another King novel, ``Christine,'' was pulled from
the library at Washington Middle School in Meriden, Conn., after a
parent complained about offensive passages.
   These are only a few of the incidents reported to the
51,000-member educational association between May 1989 and May
1990, Krug said, calling Banned Books Week ``a celebration of our
freedom to read.''
   The week runs through Sept. 29. It's part of a national effort
to draw attention to the more than 1,000 instances of challenging
or banning books reported last year, Krug said.
   ``Only 15 percent of censorship attempts ever reach the light of
day,'' Krug said. ``We've proven time and time again that
censorship dies in the light of day. We want to have the
opportunity for the public to look at the issue from all sides.''
   ``We're here to help librarians, teachers and other concerned
citizens keep reading materials available to the public,'' she
said. ``There's a lot of covert censorship going on.''
   Krug said she advises librarians and teachers to set specific
policies and procedures on censorship, but professionals aren't the
only ones who should be involved in the issue. Concerned parents,
she said, should make their views known at school board meetings or
in letters to newspaper editors.
   ``As individual citizens we have to stand up and be counted,''
Krug said. ``We have to join the battle.''

<HEAD>Report Says Missiles Had Fuel Leaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GWINN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear test missiles sent to K.I. Sawyer
Air Force Base were leaking jet fuel and posed the danger of
explosion, according to a report to Congress.
   The report by the General Accounting Office says 10 of 25 test
missiles delivered to the northern Michigan base developed fuel
leaks. Seven were returned to the manufacturer for repair and three
were repaired at Sawyer.
   The report said the Strategic Air Command ordered Sawyer to
isolate the missiles from other weapons because of the potential
for explosion.
   Sawyer officials refused Monday to comment on the report,
referring questions to SAC leaders in Omaha, Neb. ``It's SAC's
program. We haven't even seen the report,'' said Saywer spokeswoman
Sgt. Anita Bailey.
   Program spokesman Capt. Harry Edwards at SAC headquarters' media
affairs office in Omaha said he has never seen the GAO report and
could not comment.
   In an appendix to the report, David J. Berteau, a principal
deputy to the assistant Air Force secretary for production and
logistics, said the leaks have been corrected with the development
of new fuel bladders.
   The GAO report, which was finished in April and released in
early September, maligns the Advanced Cruise Missile program as
costly and unreliable. The missile, an updated version of the air
launched cruise missile, can be armed with a nuclear warhead and
uses ``stealth'' technology to evade radar detection.
   The main contractor for the missiles is General Dynamics Convair
Division.
   The report says the Air Force may have wasted $50 million on the
$424 million program, including $30 million spent on construction
at an unspecified Air Force base that will no longer handle the
missile.
   An Air Force response printed with the report defends the
program, saying its reliability ``compares favorably to that of
other cruise missiles at the same period of development.''

<HEAD>Suspect in Hikers' Slayings Wanted on Murder Charge in Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused in the slayings of two
Appalachian Trail hikers in Pennsylvania is wanted on a murder
charge under another name in Florida, authorities said Monday.
   Pennsylvania authorities want David ``Casey'' Horn extradited to
face charges in the Sept. 13 slayings of hikers Molly LaRue, 25, of
Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Geoffrey Logan Hood, 26, of Signal
Mountain, Tenn.
   In Bartow, Fla., Horn is wanted under the name Paul David Crews
on charges of first-degree murder, robbery and unlawful flight in
the July 1986 stabbing death of a 56-year-old woman, said Bartow
Detective Sgt. Robert Schott.
   ``He's been on the run for over four years,'' Schott said.
   Horn, 38, was being held without bon at the Eastern Regional
Jail, said Berkeley County Corrections Officer Gary Reed.
   No date for an extradition hearing had been set. Horn still
didn't have a lawyer, Reed said.
   Horn's fingerprints, photo and a tattoo on his shoulder match
those of Crews, FBI spokesman Larry Curtin said from Tampa, Fla.
   FBI officials said agents in Lakeland, Fla., were tipped to his
whereabouts by a newspaper story on the Appalachian Trail slayings.
   ``They said `that sounds very much like the way Paul Crews
operated here,' '' Curtin said.
   Horn was arrested Friday by U.S. Parks Service rangers as he
arrived in Harpers Ferry. Authorities said he was wearing one of
the hiker's boots and carrying one of their backpacks.
   LaRue and Hood were hiking the 2,160-mile trail from Maine to
Georgia. They were killed in their sleeping bags during a pre-dawn
attack near Duncannon, Pa., a rural community about 10 miles north
of Harrisburg. Authorities said Hood had been shot repeatedly and
LaRue had been stabbed.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Start Anti-Government Mobilization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista Front on Monday
announced a new round of strikes to block the government's plans to
sell state-owned companies and lay off civil servants.
   After a meeting Saturday of the 103-member Sandinista Assembly,
the front said staggered, partial strikes would begin this week and
build to nationwide demonstrations on Oct. 1.
   ``We are against the attitude of the government that is intent
on imposing an economic plan that makes the rich richer and the
poor poorer,'' the Sandinistas said in a communique.
   Public transportation employees were the only ones who walked
out on Monday. Workers seized control of government bus depots and
burned tires outside them, sending black plumes of smoke into the
air.
   Only a few police were patrolling the depots. The government has
been reluctant to try to call in the Sandinista-controlled police
to restrain the strikes. The Sandinistas still control the army as
well.
   Since losing elections in February, the Sandinistas have been
intent on showing they can ``rule from below,'' in the words of
former President Daniel Ortega.
   General strikes in May and July temporarily paralyzed the
country with street marches and takeovers of state businesses and
industries.
   After 10 years in power, the Sandinistas can quickly mobilize
thousands to back their programs. The government coalition has no
such grass-roots organization and as a result is blocked from
carrying out programs the Sandinistas oppose.
   Government officials, business leaders and some independent
trade unions met last week to work out a social pact to rescue
Nicaragua's economy.
   On Monday, the currency was devalued for the 37th time since
Mrs. Chamorro was inaugurated April 25. The official exchange rate
of the cordoba fell from 1.12 million cordobas to the dollar to
1.18 million.
   Weekly devaluations are part of Mrs. Chamorro's effort to
stabilize the economy. Her government also is attempting to
decentralize the economy, reduce the fiscal deficit and increase
production.
   Those goals entail laying off thousands of public employees,
privatizing unproductive state enterprises and cutting off
subsidies for public services.
   The Sandinistas haven't offered any alternative economic plan to
the one Chamorro's government is following.

<HEAD>Commodity Exports Expected to Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm commodity exports are expected to drop
next year as foreign production competes with U.S. sales of grain
and other products, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said a drop in corn
exports in the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 will help lead
the overall decline.
   ``U.S. corn exports are expected to fall 7 million tons (more
than 275 million bushels) as overseas customers replace U.S. corn
with competitors' feed wheat,'' the report said.
   ``Wheat prices are expected to average lower in 1990-91 due to
larger crops. But higher soybean prices will help offset some of
this decline,'' it said.
   Overall farm exports in the current year are estimated at about
148.5 million metric tons worth about $40 billion, both up slightly
from 1988-89.
   The report didn't include any figures to show U.S. export values
and volume in 1990-91. The department's first official export
estimates for next year will be issued in late November.

<TEXT>
   President Bush declared Monday ``I'm not going
to be distracted'' by Iraq's Saddam Hussein's efforts to link the
Persian Gulf crisis with the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   ``First we've got to take care of the situation that exists
right now, naked aggression of one country against the other. That
cannot be permitted to stand,'' Bush told a group of Arab-American
leaders.
   The president said that the United States ``simply cannot'' link
the Kuwaiti takeover by Iraq with the Palestinian issue.
   The Iraqi leader has suggested that one way to ease the crisis
would be for Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories it has
occupied since 1967, where many Palestinians live.
   The United States, Bush said, is committed to peace in the
region, and ``once the Gulf crisis is on its way to resolution,''
wants to ``go forward with the peace process.'' Any ultimate
solution, he said, must include recognition of Israel by Arab
nations ``and legitimate political rights for the Palestinians.''
   Bush, telling members of the audience that they understood the
tensions in the region better than most people, said: ``To permit
Saddam Hussein to link these two questions and approve of his
aggression that way, we simply cannot do it. We are going to resist
his attempts to justify what he did based on other regional
concerns. So, I think these are merely, on his part, an effort to
create additional pretexts so that he can stay in Kuwait.''
   In a lively question-and-answer session, Bush was asked why the
United States would not negotiate with Iraq. He answered with a
description of U.S. policy.
   ``No negotiations,'' Bush said. U.S. policy, he continued,
``remains clear: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely,
immediately and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government
must be restored, the security and stability of the Persian Gulf
assured and American citizens abroad must be protected.''
   Asked why the United States was depriving the children of Iraq
of food in the international trade embargo, Bush said that the
Iraqi regime would not permit relief organizations to send in
supervised food shipments.
   ``I am much less interested in feeding Saddam Hussein's army at
this point,'' Bush said. He said he was concerned about the plight
of women and children, including Asian refugees stranded in Kuwait.
   The State Department, meanwhile, said at least 900 American men,
women and children remain trapped in Kuwait and Iraq, and 93 have
been detained by Iraq authorities.
   Some of those detained are ill, and their captivity is
``barbaric,'' said the department's principal spokeswoman, Margaret
Tutwiler.
   Iraq has said it is putting American men in strategic
installations to deter attacks.
   Department officials said they had no knowledge of a claim by
Iraq that the United States rebuffed an offer to release the
captive Americans in exchange for permission for the Iraqi foreign
minister to land in New York in an Iraqi plane to attend United
Nations meetings. The department has refused landing permission,
saying the official could take a commercial flight.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater characterized
Saddam's new threat to blow up oil fields in the Middle East part
of ``a daily diatribe from Saddam.''
   ``We won't get into responding every day to Saddam's
statements,'' he said.
   Bush was grilled by the audience, made up of 150 Arab-American
business executives and others, on U.S. policy in the Middle East.
Despite the tough questioning, he received a standing ovation at
the end of the 20-minute session.
   Bush spoke out forcefully about discrimination against
Arab-Americans and what he called ``appalling acts of hatred'' by
``a few hatemongers.''
   ``It is simply not fair to lump the outrageous behavior of a
dictator halfway around the world into how people are treated here
at home,'' he said.
   Bush defended America's de facto alliance with Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is officially called a sponsor of
terrorism by the United States.
   To a Lebanese-American man who objected sharply to the
partnership, Bush said: ``Out of this, there could well be a new
world order and part of this must be a peaceful resolution of the
division of Lebanon.''
   On Saddam's calls for Israel to give up its occupied territory,
Bush said: ``I'm not going to be distracted by this.''
   A Arab-American car dealer from Detroit told Bush he had his own
peace plan to pressure both Iraq and Israeli to give up occupied
lands.
   ``The Kuwait crisis must be taken care of first,'' Bush said.
   Bush stayed twice as long as planned after he began taking
questions. Participants were waving their hands for recognition
even before he concluded his prepared remarks.
   One man commented that a billion Moslems live under tyrannical
monarchs and asked why the United States was trying to restore the
emir of Kuwait, Bush said crisply, ``The objective is to see that
naked aggression does not pay off, sir.''

   Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday across the Southeast,
normally milder at this time of year, while at least one record
high was posted on the northern Plains.
   Record lows were 56 at Apalachicola, Fla.; 45 at Atlanta; 41 at
Birmingham, Ala.; 42 at Greenville, S.C.; 53 at Jacksonville, Fla.;
43 at Meridian, Miss.; 50 at Mobile, Ala.; 46 at Monroe, La.; 65 at

   Daytona Beach, Fla., tied its record of 62 and Montgomery, Ala.,
tied its record of 47.
   A frost warning was posted overnight over western Maryland's
Garrett County.
   At the opposite extreme, Rapid City, on the edge of the Black
Hills in western South Dakota, warmed to a record high of 89, one
degree above the previous record set three years ago.
   Afternoon rain and occasional thundershowers extended only over
southern Florida, western Texas, northern Maine, and from
southwestern Oregon into northern California.
   Some Texas streams continued running high after heavy weekend
rain.
   A few rural roads in southwestern Texas were blocked by high
water, the National Weather Service said.
   Flood warnings were posted along the Rio Grande from Presidio,
Texas, through Big Bend National Park to near Langtry, Texas, the
weather service said.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 33 at Falls City, Neb.,

   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson asked Bush
administration officials Monday to designate Wounded Knee a
national monument before the end of this year, the 100th
anniversary of the massacre there.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan did not indicate a position on
the request during a meeting with Mickelson but his aides were
``favorably disposed,'' the governor said later.
   ``What I asked (Lujan) to do was to support the idea of the
president by executive order creating a national monument at
Wounded Knee,'' Mickelson said. ``My purpose in being here today
was to express the urgency of it ... It would be the culmination of
a great year.''
   The National Park Service, however, must first study the site to
see whether the monument designation would be suitable and
feasible, said Ben Moffett, a park service spokesman in Denver.
   ``We wouldn't do that (conduct a study) until Congress asked us
to do it and provided funding for it,'' Moffett said.
   Mickelson, who designated 1990 the Year of Reconciliation in
South Dakota, will testify Tuesday at a Senate Indian Affairs
Committee hearing where descendants of Wounded Knee victims will
ask for an apology and reparations from the government as well as a
national monument.
   Mickelson said Monday that he did not support legislation
seeking the apology and compensation because he feared those issues
would slow down the effort to get the site designated a national
monument.
   Federal troops killed 300 Sioux warriors, women and children in
1890 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota in
the last major battle between Indians and the army on the northern
plains.
   Mickelson, who is chairman of the Western Governors Association,
also met White House representatives and officials from the Energy
Department and Environmental Protection Agency to express concerns
about waste disposal in western states.
   ``The message I'm going to convey is that they need to
appreciate that we in the West are willing to share our share of
the responsibility, but we have no intention of accepting waste
from all over this nation where they have not done a good job of
protecting their environment,'' Mickelson said.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate John
G. Rowland, who drove without a license for 16 months, is using
humor to respond to revelations about the lapse.
   Rowland showed up at a recent news conference sporting a lapel
badge that said ``I'm in the driver's seat.'' His staffers wore
badges identifying themselves as Rowland drivers.
   Rowland last week acknowledged that he had been driving without
a license since it expired in May 1989. His excuse was that he had
never received a renewal notice.
   ``I don't think it's a big deal,'' Rowland said. ``It's an
honest mistake. I think people understand it's human nature. It has
nothing to do with the governor's race.''
   Rowland said he renewed his license and joked that he also

   Democrat Terry Goddard is leading
Republican Fife Symington in the Arizona governor's race by a
margin of 49 percent to 32 percent, according to a survey of
registered voters.
   Four percent of respondents said they planned to vote for
someone other than Goddard or Symington, and 15 percent were
undecided, according to the survey conducted by The Arizona
Republic.
   GOP incumbent Rose Mofford is not running.
   For the survey, 601 registered voters throughout the state were
interviewed by telephone Sept. 13-16. The margin of error was plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
   Symington, a developer making his first run for public office,
said he was not surprised to find himself behind.
   ``I think it's about right because Terry has better name
(identification),'' said Symington, who won a five-way GOP primary.
   ``When I announced my intentions to run for governor, all the
political pundits said Fife Symington had no chance to win. Well,
look what happened. Now, it's Round 2,'' he said.
   Goddard, the former Phoenix mayor who swept to an easy victory
in the two-man Democratic primary, said, ``I don't get either
overjoyed or displeased over polls, but this one is pretty nice.
... I always run like I'm behind, and that's what I'm doing right

   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox believes he has

   Richard ``needs to cause the voters to laugh at Clayton Williams

   ``We've allowed him to be just a good-natured, old country boy
that in effect hides the real Clayton Williams,'' Mattox said
Monday.
   Mattox said there is still time before the Nov. 6 general
election for Richards to reverse Williams' double-digit lead in the

   ``She needs to have leaders in the business community to come

Williams as the spokesperson and symbol for Texas,'' Mattox said.

<HEAD>Congress Hears Appeals For Restrictions On Diet Pills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose daughter died after years of
diet pill abuse asked a congressional panel Monday to push for
restrictions on non-prescription weight loss drugs.
   ``She might have had a chance had these products been denied her
as a child,'' said Anthony and Diana Smith, of State Center, Iowa.
   Noelle Smith, 20, died a year ago of cardiac arrest after
struggling since she was 14 with the eating disorder anorexia
nervosa, which is an avoidance of food, and bulimia, which involves
binging and purging.
   ``She was constantly sneaking diet products into the house,''
said Mr. Smith. ``Every time we found and took from Noelle a box of
diet pills, laxatives or diuretics, she would go to the corner
store and buy a new supply.''
   Jessica McDonald, 20, of Washington, D.C., said she suffered
from the same eating disorders as a teen-ager and regularly
consumed whole boxes of non-prescription diet pills at a time.
   ``Even though I went to the drug store practically every day to
buy pills or some other product to help me lose weight, no one ever
tried to stop me or asked what I wanted the pills for,'' said
McDonald.
   She said that ``at the very least there should be an age
restriction to prevent young people from buying these drugs.''
   Vivian Hanson Meehan, president of the National Association of
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, said at least one of 10
adolescents engage in dangerous eating disorders as they try to
diet.
   ``The adolescent whoreduces food amounts to starvation levels
is playing havoc with his or her body's viability,'' said Meehan.
``Children who begin dieting at an early age may delay or prevent
menstruation because females need 18 to 22 percent of body fat for
this purpose.''
   Meehan also decried the availability of diet pills.
   ``Diet pills containing the drug phenylpropanolamine, or PPA,
pose an additional and very serious health risk to adolescents,''
she said.
   The drug is in most of the numerous, popular non-prescription
diet products used by about 10 million consumers a year. Many
medical authorities say it can cause high blood pressure, kidney
disease, heart muscle damage, heart rhythm abnormalities and
seizures.
   The Smiths, McDonald and Meehan were among witnesses testifying
before the House Small Business subcommittee, which has been
investigating the weight loss industry.
   A report from the subcommittee staff noted a University of San
Francisco study of 500 girls which showed almost half the
9-year-olds and 80 percent of those age 10 and 11 were dieting,
even though just 17 percent of the group was overweight.
   ``Our investigation found that juveniles are dieting more
obsessively than ever, and that many are suffering adverse health
effects and even death,'' said the staff report.
   Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, has been after the Federal Trade
Commission and the Food and Drug Administration to crack down on
shady diet practices.
   He said the FTC has 14 investigations under way of diet
companies and diet programs.
   But he criticized the FDA for being lax on enforcement.
   ``For almost a decade, the FDA has dawdled over regulations that
would make it illegal to sell diet products containing about 100
ineffective ingredients,'' said Wyden.

<HEAD>Sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg Term Khrushchev Remarks
`Absurd'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
said Monday their parents didn't help the Soviet Union develop an
atomic bomb, and dismissed Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs thanking
them as ``totally absurd.''
   Robert and Michael Meeropol, who have worked for years to clear
their parents' names, said they weren't shaken by the remarks by
the ousted Soviet leader, contained in tapes he made during seven
years of house arrest before his death in 1971.
   ``This stuff has been going on all the time,'' said 47-year-old
Michael Meeropol, a professor at a small private college here.
``I'll tell you what the big shock was, the first shock when I was
7 years old listening to `The Lone Ranger' when the FBI arrested my
father. After that, you know, shocks don't happen to us. We expect
them.''
   Khrushchev says in the memoirs that he heard from both Soviet
leader Josef Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov, then minister of
foreign affairs, that the Rosenbergs ``provided very significant
help in accelerating the production of our atom bomb.''
   ``Let this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people,''
he said.
   ``My reaction to (the implication of help) is that it's wholly
absurd,'' said 43-year-old Robert Meeropol, a local lawyer.
   The Rosenbergs, who maintained their innocence, were executed
June 19, 1953, for conspiracy to commit espionage. Their sons, who
took their adoptive parents' last name, have used the Freedom of
Information Act to force the release of hundreds of thousands of
pages of classified documents in the case.
   They said their research of their parents' trial and execution
turned up affidavits by scientists who said none of the evidence
brought by the government amounted to substantially useful
information about the atomic bomb.
   ``One of the things that we have discovered both in talking to
scientists and securing affidavits and looking through the FBI
files is that there were no major secrets,'' Robert Meeropol said,
noting that his parents were convicted on conspiracy charges rather
than direct espionage.
   ``We know from looking at all this that if there was any help,
and I deny that there was, it was insignificant, so anything like
this where someone is reporting that significant help was given
just doesn't make sense in terms of the record,'' he said.
   The brothers said Khrushchev may have misunderstood Stalin or
Stalin may have been lying to create the impression of having a
huge network of spies. They also suggested that ``significant
help'' could be interpreted as the Rosenbergs' refusal to implicate
others.
   Washington author Michael Beschloss, who is working on a book
about Khrushchev, said Khrushchev's earlier oral histories have
held up well, but it is difficult to gauge the merit of the
Rosenberg comments because the Soviet leader was old, ailing and
didn't have his records when he made them.
   ``Although this is an important piece of evidence, it certainly
is not a smoking gun,'' he said.
   ``We want to get all the facts out,'' Robert Meeropol said. ``I
am convinced that when that's done that we'll discover that what
Khrushchev said is either wrong or untrue.''

   A bomb exploded while
it was being manufactured in the offices of a leftist student group
at the state university, killing three students and wounding two,
police said Monday.
   The blast Sunday night destroyed the offices of the National
Union of Revolutionary Students. Police said they found gunpowder
and other explosives there.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Mota Paulino, chief of national police, said a
preliminary investigation indicated the students intended to plant
bombs in supermarkets and other businesses in this Caribbean nation
of 7 million people.
   He said the bombings were to coincide with the scheduled start
Tuesday of a three-day strike to protest a government austerity
program which sent the prices of many basic consumer items soaring
in August.
   No immediate comment came from officials of the student
organization.
   However, Ramon Almanzar, spokesman for the strike organizers,
said the strike was planned as an orderly protest and disassociated
his group from any terrorist activity.
   Police identified those killed as Pedro Ovidio Garcia, 30, a
veterinary student; Eduardo Antonion Marmol, 24, a law student; and
journalism student Hallanay Defrank.

   A center devoted to tracing the fates of people
held in Nazi concentration camps opened here Monday to handle flood
a requests expected now that the Soviet Union has released records
on 400,000 prisoners.
   The Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center,
run by the American Red Cross, offers hope to people still
wondering about their loved ones 45 years after the end of World
War II.
   The latest documents, which were recovered by Soviet soldiers
when the camps were liberated at the end of the war, include nearly
70,000 death certificates from the Auschwitz concentration camp in
Poland. Also included are the names of 130,000 prisoners forced to
work in Germany and 200,000 names of victims in other camps,
including Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Gross Rosen and Buchenwald.
   ``It offers the opportunity for closure - to allow people to
finally say `Now, I know what happened,''' said Emmy Hubert
Mogilensky, a 67-year-oldPikesville, Md., woman who learned that
her parents died in a concentration camp from a message the Red
Cross sent her brother in 1946.
   ``The pain of not knowing where they were. If they were murdered
in the camp. Did they die in the cattle cars on the way to the
camp? It haunts you. It does not let you rest,'' Mogilensky said.
   She sympathized with people still searching for answers.
   ``Can you doubt the value of these 400,000 records? Can you
imagine after 45 years still wondering, still not knowing?'' she
asked. ``Each one of these records could be a blessing.''
   Millions of people, mostly Jews, were imprisoned during Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich and an estimated 6 million Jews were killed.
   Western allies released concentration camp documents soon after
the war. But Soviet authorities kept the records sealed, despite
repeated requests. Finally, the Soviet government began releasing
them last year.
   Since the end of the war, available documents have been stored
at the International Tracing Service in Arolsen, West Germany, a
branch of the Central Tracing Agency of the International Committee
of the Red Cross. There are 46 million documents on file on about
13 million people.
   ``When I viewed a room filled with 46 million index cards, I
knew that the scope of our mission was beyond anything
imaginable,'' said Alfred Himmelrick Jr., a 57-year-old Baltimore
businessman who visited the Arolsen center while planning the
Baltimore office.
   ``These people, their children, their brothers, their sisters,
their cousins, aunts and uncles were no longer able to give voice
to say, `Here I am.' It was then that the 13 million people on file
became real, not abstract,'' he said.
   The Arolsen center has helped 1.8 million people find
information about missing relatives.
   People wishing to learn the fate of relatives or friends can
contact local American Red Cross chapters. Local caseworkers will
send the requests to the Baltimore center, where they will be
translated into German and forwarded to Arolsen.

   Eighteen children and two adults drowned
after their boat capsized in a pond near this northwest Argentine
city, according to news reports Monday.
   Police said 20 children and two adults were on board the craft
Sunday when it began to take on water. Everyone crowded to the
other side but the boat tipped over, the authorities said.
   Some of the victims were trapped under the boat and most of the
others apparently did not know how to swim. Two children were
rescued when they grabbed inner tubes from tires thrown from shore,
local news agencies reported.

<HEAD>Government Files Reverse Discrimination Suit Against Maryland
Lottery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed an unusual
reverse discrimination lawsuit Monday, accusing the Maryland
lottery of bias against white men in 1983 when it set aside several
top positions for women and minorities.
   The civil rights suit alleged that Maryland and its lottery
agency violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by refusing
to hire qualified white males for the four positions set aside for
minorities in 1983.
   The lawsuit was denounced by a state official as an unwarranted
attack on a one-time effort by Maryland to recruit more minorities
into the lottery agency.
   Two black men, a black woman and a white women were recruited
``in response to a Maryland Human Relations Commission
investigation and determination that the lottery agency was not
doing enough to meet affirmative action requirements,'' said Dennis
Sweeney, deputy state attorney general.
   The lawsuit states that the state's governor, then Harry R.
Hughes, directed the lottery agency to set aside four senior-level
positions for women or members of a racial minority.
   The hiring policy was investigated by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, which referred complaints of discrimination
to the Justice Department, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in Baltimore.
   Ten white men complained to the EEOC in 1985, said Justice
Department spokeswoman Amy Casner. The EEOC referred the case to
the Justice Department in 1988, she said.
   The lottery agency, which employs 108 people, has 12
senior-level positions, she said.
   The suit seeks an injunction barring the state of Maryland from
reserving lottery agency positions for women or members of a
minority. It also seeks compensation for white men who were the
victims of the alleged discrimination.
   Sweeney said the Justice Department has rejected overtures to
settle the case out of court, but federal officials were insistent
on obtaining a consent decree.
   ``We don't see the profit in going to this archaeological dig of
attempting to reconstruct this event in 1983,'' Sweeney said. ``All
the actors are all now either dead or retired from state
government.''
   ``We are hoping we can still talk about these issues and reason
will prevail because, quite frankly, I think the federal courts
have more important things to do,'' he said.
   Justice Department officials have sought back pay of less than
$15,000 for two men who were not hired, Sweeney said.
   Reverse discrimination lawsuits are unusual, but the Justice
Department has filed them in the past when it determines that
whites have been the victims of racial bias.

   A convoy of trucks loaded with food rolled
out of Amman on Monday bound for Baghdad with horns honking, flags
flying and hundreds of Jordanians cheering the violation of the
U.N. embargo.
   The 30 trucks, hauling rice, powdered milk and other foodstuffs
rationed in Iraq, were decorated with red, green and black
Jordanian and Iraqi flags. Banners declared the food a gift ``from
the Stone Children, the Heros of the Intifadeh in Palestine to the
Children of Iraq.''
   The convoy was a small but clear violation of the U.N. embargo
banning shipments to Iraq unless cleared by the Security Council,
and a symbol of the enthusiastic support Iraq enjoys here.
   Many in the crowd were of Palestinian origin - like about half
of Jordan's 3 million residents - and had donated food and money
and brought their children to the late afternoon rally.
   Posters showing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein being kissed by a
brown-haired boy while hugging a wide-eyed girl were among the
dozens of pro-Saddam, anti-American signs, banners and leaflets in
the crowd.
   ``We are for any Arab child and any Arab regime which is against
the Americans. We're with him because he's against the United
States, that's all,'' said Mona Bitar, who brought her five
daughters to the rally.
   ``I am teaching my children that Arabs should be unified.''
   Mrs. Bitar said that on a daughter's birthday a week ago, she
asked all the children to bring a bag of rice for the children of
Iraq instead of a present. They all complied.
   Outspoken popular support for Saddam in Jordan - whose King
Hussein has been a U.S. ally - has mystified and infuriated the
United States. But here, across the Jordan River from the West
Bank, it seems perfectly logical.
   Palestinians see Saddam as the only man standing up
unequivocally for their cause, which they feel has been ignored by
the rest of the world.
   They are angered by the United States insisting on U.N.
resolutions demanding Iraq withdraw from Kuwait while failing to
insist that Israel end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and give up its claim to Jerusalem, as required under older
U.N. resolutions.
   ``I think Saddam Hussein is a hero in a way. He is an Arab
leader fighting for Arab rights,'' said a woman in the crowd who
declined to give her name.
   One popular poster carried by member of the crowd depicted the
troika of Saddam, King Hussein and Yasser Arafat, chief of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``The poster speaks for itself,'' said the father of 8-year-old
Mutaz Khalil, who let go of one corner of the poster, pulled on his
father's pant leg and said something softly in Arabic.
   ``He's saying he's against the Jews,'' the father explained.
``Of course he is, he's Palestinian.''
   The Palestinians see American support of Israel as the reason
for their stateless status and misery.
   Taxi driver Mortagi Farhan, watching the rally from the roadside
Monday, said he sided with the activists and the intefadeh
uprising.
   ``My uncle was killed by Israelis. Two friends were killed in
Israel and six cousins are in jail. Saddam is now the No. 1 leader
standing up for the Arab cause. We will support him to the end.''
   Many Jordanians privately say they do not approve of Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait but they worry about the Western-led military
buildup in the Persian Gulf.

   An illegal Protestant
paramilitary group said Monday it had killed the wrong man a day
earlier in a pub shooting.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters apologized to the family of
48-year-old construction worker William Allister, saying they had
intended to kill a man they believe is a police informer.
   A friend of Allister's who was injured in the shooting in
Lisburn, southwest of Belfast, was also not the intended target of
the group. The man was in critical condition in a Lisburn hospital.
   The shooting occurred Sunday evening when at least one gunman
burst into the County Down Arms, singled out the two men and opened
fire on them, police said.
   Hours earlier, masked men shot and killed Colin McCullough, a
22-year-old part-time soldier parked in a car with his girlfriend
at Lough Neagh near Lurgan, about 25 miles southwest of Belfast,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Police said the woman was not hurt.
   Suspicion fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has targeted
the security forces in its fight to end British rule in Northern
Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   The soldier was the seventh member of the locally recruited
Ulster Defense Regiment to die in Northern Ireland this year. He
and the pub patron were the 41st and 42nd victims of political and
sectarian strife in the province this year.

<TEXT>
   At least 300,000 Olympic-crazy Georgians waged a
friendly confetti war Monday in downtown Atlanta as the city staged
its first ticker tape parade to celebrate landing the 1996 Summr
Games.
   The parade-goers showered 34 tons of shredded paper on the heads
of the boosters who persuaded the International Olympic Committee
to give the games to the city. The decision was announced at a
meeting last week in Tokyo.
   ``I got Andy Young good,'' said Debra Jackson, 29, of Atlanta,
after she hurled a handful of confetti at the face of the former
mayor, who rode in a convertible.
   The crowds, 10 deep along some sections of the parade route,
cheered as Young and other leaders of the city's Olympic committee
rode past and marching bands belted out the Olympic theme song.
   Police estimated at least 300,000 people showed up for the
event. The three local TV network affiliates carried the parade
live, and The Atlanta Journal slapped a huge banner headline on its
front page that read: ``WELL DONE!''
   Police said they arrested at least six juveniles for creating
disturbances after the parade. Maj. W.W. Holley said the
disturbances were caused by groups of youths from rival schools.
   Students in the area were allowed to miss a day of school if
they had their parents' permission.
   Vendors set up booths along the parade route, selling Olympic
T-shirts, red-and-white Olympic flags and bumper stickers that
read: ``Great Job Andy and Billy.'' The stickers referred to Young
and Atlanta Organizing Committee president Billy Payne.
   ``It's so exciting,'' said 24-year-old Traci Hodge, who took the
day off from work without telling her boss. ``The fact that we got
the Olympics is incredible.''
   Local historians said it was the city's first ticker tape
parade, and many children along the parade route watched in awe as
an estimated 34 tons of confetti and 100 miles of ticker tape
rained down upon them.
   ``It's like it's snowing or something,'' said 8-year-old Donta
Hayman of Atlanta.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., played with the children along the
route, jumping out of his parade car and hurling confetti back at
them.
   Among other dignitaries riding in the parade were Gov. Joe Frank
Harris, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and 85-year-old Fred Alderman,
Georgia's oldest Olympian.
   Afterward, confetti blanketed two downtown streets and was piled
several inches deep in places.
   ``Everybody needs to get a broom and get to it,'' said Linda
Slach, 35,. ``I've done my part in the cleanup. I picked some
confetti up and threw it back out again.''
   Within minutes after the parade ended, city employees were out
starting the cleanup.
   But Cedric Maddox, director of the city sanitation department,
said it would take awhile because confetti is difficult to pick up.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be through by the morning,'' he said.

<HEAD>Journal: AmEx Officials Were Behind Smear Campaign of Swiss Banker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Express Co. executive orchestrated a
smear campaign against a Swiss banker at odds with the financial
services giant, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
   Harry L. Freeman, then an executive vice president with close
ties to company chairman James D. Robinson III, approved the hiring
of a private detective and a public relations executive who
investigated Swiss banker Edmond J. Safra and spread rumors about
him, the Journal said.
   ``Company officials privately blamed the incident on a handful
of unnamed low-level employees,'' the newspaper said. ``But a
lengthy investigation by this newspaper reveals evidence suggesting
the effort to smear Mr. Safra was in fact overseen from Mr.
Freeman's office, only steps away from Mr. Robinson's.''
   False news stories about Safra began to surface in early 1988,
linking him to drug dealers, money laundering and the Mafia, the
Journal said.
   The newspaper said there was no concrete evidence that Robinson
knew of the campaign against Safra, although the American Express
chairman had regular contact with one of Freeman's operatives,
Susan Cantor.
   Last year, American Express publicly apologized to Safra,
admitting that people acting on its behalf had tried to discredit
him. American Express paid $8 million to charities of Safra's
choice to make amends.
   Freeman later retired from the company, accepting responsibility
for ``mistakes made on my watch.''
   Larry Armour, an American Express spokesman, said Monday ``it's
senseless to respond to old news, no matter how colorfully someone
chooses to repackage it.''
   The Journal said American Express and Safra began to fall out
soon after Robinson decided in 1983 to buy Safra's Geneva-based
Trade Development Bank and combine it with American Express Bank.
   The styles of the two men differed sharply, and in 1984 Safra
resigned from the company. The split between Safra and Robinson
deepened during negotiations on a settlement package, and matters
grew worse as American Express Bank officials began to suspect that
Safra, who was planning to begin another Swiss bank in 1988, was
hiring away American Express employees, the Journal said.
   Robert Smith, former chairman of American Express Bank, told the
Journal he told Robinson he had hired detectives to follow the
former American Express workers.
   Smith said he became obsessed with stopping Safra, the newspaper
said. His anger spread to other company officials, especially
Freeman, it said.
   The company tried in vain to block Safra's attempt to get a new
banking license in Switzerland in 1987, the newspaper said.
   The next year, after Safra opened his new bank, reports appeared
in newspapers in Europe and South America linking Safra to the
Mafia, now-deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, South
American drug traffickers, the CIA and the Iran-Contra scandal.
   During the course of a libel suit Safra filed against a French
newspaper, Minute, a lawyer for Safra found that a Life magazine
article about the Mafia had been faxed to Minute from American
Express headquarters in New York, the Journal said.
   Safra's investigators eventually pegged Antonio Greco, an
elusive businessman with homes in Spain and New York City, as the
source of the articles.
   Greco was an investigator working for American Express, the
Journal said. He also had an arrest record in the United States and
Italy going back to 1962, and had been convicted on charges
including theft, conspiracy and handling stolen goods, the
newspaper said.
   The Journal said Greco's link at American Express was Susan
Cantor, now a senior vice president at American Express Bank and
before that an employee in the American Express public relations
office, working under Harry Freeman, the Journal said.
   Freeman was convinced that Safra wanted to destroy American
Express Bank and had been collecting rumors about him, the Journal
said.
   At first, Freeman used Ms. Cantor, a former ABC News employee,
to gather information on Safra but her task evolved to spreading
rumors and negative news stories about him, the newspaper said.
   In a statement to the Journal, Ms. Cantor said she ``never
intended or sought to disseminate false information concerning
Edmond Safra to anyone, and I never instructed, asked or engaged
anyone to spread such information.''
   The Journal said it interviewed dozens of people for the story
including private detectives and 15 current and former American
Express executives.

<TEXT>
   Jane Pauley, enjoying life in prime time since
leaving 13 years of pre-dawn wakeups on ``Today,'' is assured of a
new midseason series and a new five-year contract, NBC said Monday.
   The series' title, ``Real Life With Jane Pauley,'' also was the
title of five Pauley specials broadcast in prime time this summer.
All did well in the ratings, averaging a 21 percent share of the
audience, NBC said.
   Terms of her new contract weren't disclosed. Pauley, who turns
40 on Oct. 31, left ``Today'' in December after a series of changes
and turmoil there led to her departure. She was succeeded as
co-anchor by Deborah Norville.
   Pauley's series and new contract were announced earlier Monday
to NBC News staffers in a memo from NBC News president Michael
Gartner. The memo also contained potentially bad news for perhaps
as many as 25 employees.
   In it, Gartner said there will be an increase - no number was
specified - in the news division's work force and some employees
shifted to ``new shows.''
   However, he warned, ``others whose skills don't match those
needed for the new shows or for any show, perhaps as many as 25,
may be laid off.''

   Saddam Hussein's videotaped message to the

said Monday.
   The Iraqi Embassy in Washington said it will turn the tape over
to CBS News, which will serve as a distribution pool, CBS said.
   CBS said it had not yet received the tape, but expected it to be
delivered Tuesday morning.
   Saddam's speech is believed to be a rebuttal to Bush's message
to the Iraqi people, which was shown on Iraq's state-controlled TV
on Sept. 16.
   The Bush administration has refused to offer any guidance to the
networks about airing the Saddam speech, but Bush on Friday
ridiculed Saddam's request for 30 minutes of air time to address
the American people.
   ``That would just finish him off in the United States. I don't
know about the rest of the world. Nobody could stay awake.''

   Israeli army
bulldozers razed shops and houses on Monday to punish Palestinians
suspected of killing a soldier in a Gaza Strip refugee camp, Arab
reports and U.N. officials said.
   A dozen buildings were destroyed before a Supreme Court
restraining order halted demolition, they said, including the gas
station where the soldier was stoned to death.
   Farayeh Abu Meddin, chairman of the Gaza bar association, said
army bulldozers leveled at least six shops Monday night. An
official with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said five houses and one shop were torn
down earlier in the day.
   An army spokesman issued a statement saying Defense Minister
Moshe Arens had approved proposals from the General Staff to
``widen the area for security and military reasons.''
   ``The state and military prosecutor will on Tuesday seek
cancellation of the restraining order,'' it added.
   Reserve Sgt. Amnon Pomeranz, 46, was stoned to death in the
Bureij refugee camp Thursday after his car hit a donkey cart,
injuring two Palestinian teen-agers. The Palestinian mob set his
car and body afire with gasoline-soaked rags.
   Bureij residents said the bulldozers came in under protection
from scores of soldiers.
   They said generators were used to provide light after
electricity to the camp was cut. A retaining wall at the camp
entrance also was demolished, they said.
   The U.N. official said about 20 shops had been cleared of
furniture and goods in anticipation of the destruction.
   Supreme Court Judge Theodore Orr issued the temporary
restraining order in Jerusalem at the request of the Association
for Civil Rights in Israel.
   The association's legal adviser, Joshua Schoffman, said Orr
ruled that Bureij residents should be given time to petition the
military governor of Gaza and the Supreme Court regarding the
demolition orders.
   Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labor Party, told Israel
TV, ``Gaza is a collective punishment to Israel and, if we carry
out collective punishments in Gaza, it won't make things easier for
Israel. We have to decide what will happen to Gaza in the future.''
   Israeli newspaper reports said the government also was
considering deporting Palestinians suspected of involvement in the
slaying.
   The Bureij camp, home to 20,000 Palestinians, was under curfew
Monday for the fifth day while soldiers searched the area for
suspects.
   In Nusseirat camp, across the highway from Bureij, people waited
in fear that soldiers would enter to search for men who fled
Bureij.
   Newly painted graffiti declared Nusseirat's solidarity with
Bureij.
   ``Salute and praise our heroic camp El Bureij,'' said one
slogan, signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization-backed
leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
   Pomeranz was the 12th Israeli soldier killed since the uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in
December 1987.
   Forty-eight Israelis, including Pomeranz, have been killed in
the uprising. Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 730
Palestinians. At least 264 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboratng with Israel.

<HEAD>Hu Sen Agrees To Resume Talks with Cambodian Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla official said Monday that
peace talks should resume between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
and guerrilla groups now that a dispute over the makeup of a
transitional goverment has been settled.
   The three factions of the guerrilla coalition met Sunday and
agreed to resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk's proposal that
they give the government another seat on the Supreme National
Council.
   Hun Sen then agreed to resume the talks, the guerrilla official
said, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   He said the guerrillas want the next meeting to elect Sihanouk
as council chairman and appoint a delegation to represent Cambodia
at the United Nations.
   On Sept. 10, six government members and six guerrilla members
formed the transitional council, which under a U.N. peace plan is
to help guide Cambodia to democracy through new elections.
   The council's first meeting collapsed in Bangkok last week after
the guerrillas demanded that Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, be
its 13th member and chairman.
   Hun Sen agreed that Sihanouk could preside over the council, but
said an additional seat for a government representative should be
added.
   On Friday, Sihanouk urged his guerrilla allies to yield to Phnom
Penh's demand, so the new council will have 14 members.
   The guerrillas now hold the U.N. seat but are ready to transfer
it to the council. The deadline for presenting new credentials is
Oct. 18.
   Sihanouk sat out the last round of negotiations but said he will
attend the next meeting after he is elected chairman.
   Hun Sen's government is battling the forces of Sihanouk and two
allied guerrilla groups - the Khmer Rouge of Khieu Samphan and the
Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former Prime Minister
Son Sann.
   The war began with Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in late 1978,
and the ouster of the Khmer Rouge. During the Khmer Rouge rule from
1975-1978, hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Thailand was frustrated by the failure of the first council
meeting, and said it will play host to another meeting only if it
is clear beforehand that it will result in agreements.

<HEAD>Six Years Later, Goetz Takes Stand in Subway Shooting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz testified under
oath for the first time Monday about the December afternoon six
years ago when he shot four youths on a Manhattan subway train,
paralyzing one of them.
   But exactly what his testimony means depends on is describing
it.
   Goetz, acting as his own lawyer, moved successfully to get the
media banned from his deposition in a $50 million civil suit filed
by victim Darrell Cabey.
   Ronald Kuby, the paralyzed plaintiff's attorney, said Goetz had
undermined his case on the stand, while Goetz said the case could
be dismissed later this week.
   ``Mr. Goetz made it clear he intended to destroy Darrell Cabey,
to end his life. If anything, Bernie Goetz convicted himself with
his own mouth,'' said Kuby.
   But Goetz, when the three-hour hearing was over, said the key to
his testimony was that he fired three times at Cabey on Dec. 22,
1984. Why did he shoot? ``I was being mugged,'' Goetz told
reporters.
   The subway gunman wouldn't go any further in describing his
appearance, but Kuby said Goetz claims his first shot missed Cabey,
now 22, and the second one struck the plaintiff.
   When Goetz then told Cabey, ``You don't look so bad, here's
another,'' and fired again at the youth a third time, there was no
bullet in the chamber. Kuby said that doesn't matter because it
clearly shows intent to injure.
   The soft-spoken Goetz saw things differently. Goetz said he
intends to move for a dismissal of the case on Wednesday after he
questions Cabey in the same state courtroom.
   ``I believe Darrell Cabey is going to say he doesn't remember
why he was shot or what happened on that subway. Darrell Cabey is
going to pretend he's a mental vegetable. Everybody knows Darrell
Cabey is faking,'' said Goetz.
   Goetz, 42, was acquitted of attempted murder in the shooting but
convicted of a weapons possession charge; he never took the stand
at his trial. He served 8{ months in prison on his conviction.
   Goetz was subsequently sued for $50 million by Cabey, who also
reportedly suffered brain damage due to the shooting. The three
other teens Goetz shot all recovered.

<HEAD>Haitian Political Parties Withdraw Opposition to Early Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The likelihood of elections in
Haiti this year increased Monday when three major political parties
agreed to participate in voting organized by the country's current
administration.
   Bolstered by the support of the parties - including the Haitian
Communist Party - and by an infusion of foreign aid, the
independent electoral council was expected to hold the election in
mid-December.
   Louis Dejoie Jr., chief of the moderate National Industrial and
Agricultural Party, said, ``We are going to launch our election
campaign. The armed forces have taken steps which should give
voters confidence in safe elections.''
   The council earlier postponed elections planned for Nov. 4
because of lack of money. Also, many politicians were refusing to
participate.
   They claimed that interim President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot had
done little to investigate political murders, reform the
notoriously corrupt and brutal military, or resolve Haiti's grave
economic problems.
   ``We still insist on minimum security conditions and the arrest
and trial of criminal supporters of dictatorship,'' said
Jean-Claude Bajeux of the socialist Congress of Democratic
Movements. ``If the voters are threatened, we will withdraw from
the race. But to refuse to compete while Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot is
in office is political suicide.''
   Communist leader Rene Theodore said that while he opposes Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot, politicians here are ``handicapped by the lack of
an alternative to her power which is acceptable to all.''
   The three parties are the largest among seven in the 12-party
Unity Assembly, which last month demanded that Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot resign. The assembly appointed her president in
March.
   A Council of State, set up to share power with Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot, accused her of being an ``obstacle'' to credible
elections. Council members said she made decisions without
consulting them and mismanaged the economy.
   On Saturday, former President Jimmy Carter said during a visit
that the international community believed the Pascal-Trouillot
administration could hold fair elections. The United States and
Canada recently sent money to the electoral council.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections collapsed on
Nov. 29, 1987, when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to
death at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot heads the fifth government since dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled in 1986, ending a 29-year family
dictatorship.

<TEXT>
   People who regularly eat fish taken from
streams near pulp and paper mills that discharge dioxin run a
increased risk of developing cancer, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Monday.
   The EPA made public the results of a study showing that dioxin
concentrations in fish downstream from 19 such mills ``may be high
enough to pose an increased cancer risk greater than one in
10,000'' to average consumers of fish caught there.
   ``The estimated cancer risk is potentially higher for avid
sports fishermen and subsistence level fishermen because their
consumption of fish is generally higher than that of average
consumers,'' the EPA said.
   The EPA said its risk estimates are based on the consumption of
fish - such as catfish, bass, suckers and squaw fish - that spend
their entire lives near a paper mill and accumulate greater
concentrations of dioxin in their tissues.
   The risk estimates do not apply to migratory fish, such as
salmon, that spend only a short portion of their lives in the
contaminated waters.
   The one-in-10,000 estimate is an upper bound. Any risk, if
present, could be lower. The agency generally tries to act against
risks this large, and treats smaller risks with less concern.
   The average risk in the United States of dying of cancer from
any source is about one in five.
   The cancer risk for fish taken from waters below the
International Paper Co. mill at Georgetown, S.C., could be as high
as one in 50, the EPA said.
   There are 104 paper mills operated by 38 companies that produce
paper bleached with chlorine compounds and that discharge dioxin.
   Dioxin, a byproduct of the bleaching process, is a powerful
cause of cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals. The EPA
lists it as a probable cause of cancer in humans, but there has
been no proof it actually causes human cancers.
   The EPA said it is issuing waste water discharge permits, over
the next two years, to 66 mills to limit dioxin discharges. Many of
the permits will require mills to reduce the use of chlorine, and
the 66 mills will have to comply no later than June 1993.
   The environmental agency said it is also developing national
guidelines and standards to limit dioxin contamination from the
manufacture of bleached paper products, and will seek cooperation
from industry and the states for further pollution reduction
initiatives.
   It said that the new standards will likely focus on changes in
the bleaching process to prevent the formation of dioxin in sludge
and pulp as well as waste water.
   Many of the 104 mills have already reduced dioxin discharges,
some of them significantly, the EPA said.
   Here are the mills posing a maximum likely risk of greater than
one in 10,000. After each mill is the risk estimate and whether an
advisory against eating fish from the stream has been issued.
   Boise Cascade, Rumford, Maine, one in 10,000, yes.

   Wyerhaeuser, Cosmopolis, Wash., one in 10,000
   The agency's announcement identified a mill operated by the Leaf
River Forest Co. at New Augusta, Miss. as posing a cancer risk from
fish of greater than one in 10,000, but an accompanying table
appeared to state a lower risk. Sean McElheny, the agency spokesman
on the issue, said the table was correct and the mill should not
have been listed in the statement.

   Rabbi Meir Kahane went on trial in a Jerusalem

leading an anti-Arab rally after the stabbing deaths of two
Israelis last year.
   Kahane, a U.S. native, was also charged with sedition for
calling Arabs ``cancer spreading in our midsts'' during a separate
incident. The national Itim news agency reported he denied both
charges.
   Kahane led a group of his anti-Arab Kach Party down one of
Jerusalem's main avenues after a Palestinian stabbed and killed two
elderly Israelis waiting at a bus stop. Kahane's group marched down
the road shouting ``Death to the Arabs!'' Police dispersed the
group with tear gas when they tried to enter an Arab section of
Jerusalem.
   Seven other Kach activists were also charged with disturbing
public order.
   Judge Yehudit Tzur set the date for the next hearing in
December.

   Honda will put air bags in all its cars
by the 1994 model year, joining the Big Three U.S. automakers in
announcing plans to make the safety devices standard equipment the
next few years.
   Currently, Chrysler Corp. equips all of its U.S.-made cars with
driver-side air bags, and General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Corp.
have announced they will follow suit by the middle of the decade.
   Honda, which now puts automatic seat belts on its cars,
announced Monday it will install driver- and passenger-side
airbags. Nobuhiko Kawamoto, new president of Honda Motor Corp.,
made the announcement to reporters Monday during a U.S. visit.
   Air bags inflate in a crash to keep a car's occupants from being
flung into the dashboard, steering wheel and windshield.
   Japanese automakers have been comparatively slow to install air
bags.
   Chrysler has made it's fleet-wide air bags an important part of
its advertising. Though all Chrysler's its U.S.-made cars have
driver-side air bags, the cars it receives from other companies,
notably Mitsubishi Motors Corp., don't have the safety devices.
   General Motors Corp. announced recently said it will expand the
use of driver and passenger side air bags to all of its
domestically designed cars by late 1995 for the 1996 model year.
Ford Motor Co. has said that by the mid-1990s it would equip all of
its cars with driver and passenger side air bags.

<TEXT>
   The Senate narrowly rejected a proposal Monday
night to aid autoworkers laid off in any required shift by
automakers to higher-mileage cars.
   In debate on a bill to require cars to average 40 miles per
gallon, the Senate voted 49-46 to reject an amendment by Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., that would have provided special unemployment
assistance for those workers.
   A vote on whether to close off debate on the bill was scheduled
for Tuesday.
   ``The passage of this amendment will doom this bill,'' declared
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a co-sponsor.
   Later the Senate agreed, 55-40, to a include in the legislation
new incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on
alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol or natural gas. The
measure would allow manufacturers to claim credits against fuel
efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles.
   Similar fuel economy legislation has been introduced in the
House but has yet to emerge from committee.
   In earlier debate on the legislation, opponents argued that the
higher fuel economy requirements would be a death blow to the
midsize family sedan and force automakers to produce only small
cars.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., chief sponsor of the legislation,
disputed such claims, arguing higher fuel efficiency can be
achieved without sacrificing the six-passenger automobile.
   ``It means smaller cars, it means less safe cars,'' declared
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., who has led efforts to block
consideration of the measure.
   The legislation's supporters maintained that manufacturers have
shown in the past that they can come up with technologies to
improve fuel efficiency greatly and still provide customers with a
broad range of vehicle models.
   In aiming to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, the
bill would would require cars to achieve on a fleet average 35 mpg
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001. He said that would eventually save 2.8
million barrels of oil daily.
   The automakers have said they can't meet those goals without
making cars dramatically smaller and stopping production of midsize
and large vehicles.
   Bryan read statements by auto industry executives in the early
1970s predicting the demise of the family sedan as a result of fuel
efficiency requirements then under consideration.
   ``That just didn't happen. The six-passenger vehicle is here
just as it was before,'' said Bryan.

<TEXT>
   Jordanian and Yemeni envoys
expelled from Saudi Arabia this week were monitored photographing
strategic oil, military and government installations and later
meeting with Iraqi diplomats, diplomatic sources said Monday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saudi
officials believed an attempted break-in at the kingdom's largest
oil company two weeks ago was part of the alleged espionage
campaign for which the Riyadh government expelled most Iraqi,
Yemeni and Jordanian diplomats.
   Some of the expelled diplomats had been seen earlier in the area
of the oil company, Saudi Aramco, and also at another major Saudi
oil field and installation at Safaniya, the sources said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to destroy Middle
East oil fields in any war with U.S. and other forces deployed to
the region following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Aramco officials confirmed that an outside fence at its complex
was cut two weeks ago by unidentified intruders who fled when a
security guard turned a light on them. These officials, who also
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said an additional security
fence closer to the tanks never was breached.
   A company spokesman did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking additional information.
   An internal Aramco memo written several days after the
fence-cutting refers to the incident as ``terrorist'' and says
Aramco compound security has been improved and access to the
compound restricted.
   The diplomatic sources said they were reluctant to discuss the
Aramco incident in detail because the government did not want to
raise concern among American and other expatriate workers. Most of
those workers sent their families home after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia ordered the diplomats expelled Saturday, saying
they had ``engaged in activities jeopardizing the peace and
security of the kingdom.''
   A Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said complaints were made to
the three governments about ``the blatant and flagrant
infringements'' but the diplomats did not halt their improper
activities.
   Diplomatic sources said the order affected 14 Iraqis, 56 Yemenis
and 10 Jordanian envoys. Earlier, Saudi Arabia said it was ending
its practice of allowing unrestricted entry to the kingdom from
neighboring Yemen.
   The expulsions were also seen as a sign of Saudi displeasure
with Yemen and Jordan's failure to take sides against Saddam.
   On Monday, diplomatic sources said numerous Palestinians and
Jordanians also have been told to leave the kingdom in the seven
weeks since the invasion of Kuwait.
   The sources said these moves were for ``security reasons,'' but
refused to be more specific and said they could not provide exact
numbers.
   The sources said the Jordanian and Yemeni diplomats were placed
under strict surveillance immediately following the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. Saudi Arabia had immediately restricted the
movements of Iraqi envoys to Riyadh.
   ``It was obvious they would need help if they wanted to engage
in espionage,'' one source said.
   This source and another diplomatic official familiar with the
situation said Saudi internal security monitored a sudden flurry of
unusual activity by Yemeni and Jordanian diplomats, including long
drives to areas of the Eastern province ``in which they had no
business.''
   The Eastern province is home to Aramco, Safaniya, other major
oil installations and to Saudi military bases and camps now being
used by American, British and other foreign troops here for the
multinational defense effort.
   One source, who reported receiving a briefing on the activities
from Saudi military officials, said the Yemenis and Jordanians were
monitored taking photographs of the strategic facilities in the
Eastern province and also of government buildings in Riyadh.
   ``The first rule of terrorism is to stake out the targets,'' one
of the sources said. Still, this official said the Saudi government
had no concrete evidence linking the suspicious activity to the
attempted break-in at Aramco.
   Two sources said Saudi authorities monitored meetings between
the Jordanians, Yemenis and Iraqi diplomats who are restricted to
Riyadh.
   Security in the Eastern province area has been increased, with
armed patrols driving along highways and coastal roads throghout
the night.
   Saudi officials said the increased security is partly
attributable to the recent suspicions about the diplomats'
movements but also because of fears Iraq-sponsored terrorists might
have slipped into Saudi Arabia when Iraq opened the Kuwaiti border
for several days last week.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Five Measures Ineligible for Ballot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five of eight voter initiatives, including
one that would have allowed tax credits at parochial schools, are
ineligible for the November election, a judge ruled Monday.
   Three other statewide measures on the Nov. 6 general election
ballot could be disqualified under the ruling by Marion County
Circuit Judge Richard Barber. Among them is a measure, which if
approved, would outlaw most abortions in the state.
   Barber said the five initiatives do not qualify because they
won't be accompanied by financial impact statements as required by
state law. The statements - estimating each measure's fiscal impact
on the state - were earlier declared invalid because they weren't
certified by deadline.
   Both the state and a group backing the education measure said
they would appeal Barber's decision to the state Court of Appeals,
which could send the case to the Oregon Supreme Court without
ruling.
   The education measure would allow tax credits of up to $2,500 a
year each for pupils at private schools, including church-supported
schools, and for children taught at home.
   That measure, which drew the interest of educators across the
country, also would have allowed parents to send their children
across district lines to any public school.
   ``It would be a travesty and an injustice if the public weren't
allowed to vote on a measure because state officials didn't do
their job,'' said Steve Buckstein, spokesman for Oregonians for
Educational Choice.
   The other measures affected by Monday's ruling would limit
property taxes to 1.5 percent of value, shut down the Trojan
nuclear plant about 40 miles northwest of Portland until waste
disposal requirements are met, ban some non-recyclable packaging
and establish a program to put able welfare applicants to work.
   Barber's ruling ``strikes at the heart of the initiative
process,'' Secretary of State Barbara Roberts said in announcing
the state's plan to appeal. It means that a ``legal technicaltiy
can take away a constitutional right,'' she said.
   About 84,000 registered voters signed petitions to get the
educational initiative on the ballot, while the measure on the
nuclear plant required about 63,000 signatures.
   Because of printing deadlines, Barber said the five measures
could stay on the ballot but that votes for or against them would
not be counted.
   Barber's decision was an outgrowth of earlier Marion County
Circuit Court rulings that the fiscal statements were invalid.
   State law specifies that the secretary of state, state treasurer
and the directors of the Executive and Revenue departments certify
the fiscal impact statements.
   State Elections Director Jack Graham said those officials were
polled on the Aug. 8 deadline and that three of four agreed to the
statements. But the statements weren't signed until after the
deadline.
   If the ruling stands on appeal, three more measures lacking
fiscal impact statements also would have to be disqualified, he
said.
   Those measures would outlaw most abortions, require parental
notice of abortions involving minors and change taxation of some
public employee pensions.
   If all eight are disqualified, three measures would be left on
the ballot: two legislative housekeeping measures and one that
would require seat belt use. They didn't require financial impact
statements.

   However, Leclerc denied published reports the group is backing
out of the ENTel phone company deal or cannot meet the deadline.
The consortium is still planning ``to take over the operation of
the north zone,'' he told Radio Mitre.
   On June 28, the consortium that includes Bell Atlantic Corp. of
Philadelphia was awarded 60 percent of the northern half of ENTel
in return for $100 million cash, $2.2 billion in debt papers and
$178 million in notes payable over six years.
   Another consortium that includes Citibank and Spain's national
communications company Telefonica was awarded the southern half for
$114 million in cash, $2.7 billion in debt papers and $202 million
in notes.
   Each sector under the agreement gets half of the Buenos Aires
area and the northern or southern half of the country.
   Total value of the deal to provide telephone service in this
country of 32 million residents is about $1.34 billion.
   ``This is the largest privatization project going on anywhere in
the world. It shouldn't come as a shock that there are problems,''
said David Frost, Bell Atlantic's operations manager in Argentina.
   ``It is clear that the government wants us to move as quickly as
possible in wrapping up the various loose ends,'' Frost said. ``But
it is also clear to us that Bell Atlantic is the company the
government wants to manage operations in the north.''
   Frost declined to comment on how close Manufacturers Hanover and
its Argentine partners are to meeting the down payment and debt
titles.
   The key date is Oct. 8, he said, ``and we're doing everything we
can to meet that deadline.''
   If Manufacturers Hanover fails to make the deadline, another
consortium that includes J.P. Morgan and Co. and the Italian
telecommunications company STET reportedly would step in. The
consortium was runner-up to Manufacturers Hanover in June 28
bidding.
   President Carlos Menem said Monday that the Oct. 8 date is
``unmovable'' and if Manufacturers Hanover fails to fulfill its
obligations, the government will award the bid to STET, according
to the private news agency Diarios y Noticias.
   The state carrier Aerolineas Argentinas also is supposed to be
formally taken over on Oct. 8, by a consortium that includes the
Spanish national carrier Iberia and the Argentine airline Cielos
del Sur.
   That sale, too, has come close close to stalling for lack of
funds. The consortium apparently intended to buy the airline with
funds raised by selling planes and leasing them back. The
government insists the buyers use more of their own capital.

   Lithuania's prime minister met with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on Monday and reiterated her refusal to
sign a treaty of union that Moscow is negotiating with the 15
Soviet republics.
   Gorbachev reacted ``skeptically'' to her declaration, Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was quoted as saying by the Tass news
agency.
   The Soviet Union is preparing a treaty tying together its
splintering republics as a loose confederation with strong economic
links. Gorbachev has said the accord is vital to his plans to move
the nation to a market economy.
   Tass quoted Mrs. Prunskiene as saying negotiations with the
Kremlin on Lithuanian independence could begin by the end of this
week. Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has accused Soviet
authorities of delaying the talks.
   Lithuania declared its independence March 11, but agreed to
suspend the declaration in exchange for the lifting of an oil and
natural gas embargo that Gorbachev had imposed in May, and
Gorbachev's agreement to hold negotiations on the issue.

   Widows, elderly parents and friends
wept or bowed their heads on Monday in remembrance of the 157 North
Americans who died fighting in the Israeli army.
   The president of the Association of Americans and Canadians in
Israel, Sherwin Pomrantz, said the annual ceremony is held to point
up the contribution the 80,000-member community of North American
Jews has made here.
   ``It is an opportunity for us to stop and say these are people
who came here and really gave their last full measure of devotion
as North Americans to Israel,'' Pomerantz said.
   Two names of fallen Americans were added to the bronze plaque
this year.
   One, Ze'ev Traum, 40, moved to Israel from the Bronx borough of
New York City following the 1967 Middle East war.
   He was serving in the reserves last November when Arab
guerrillas ambushed his jeep in the occupied Gaza Strip fire,
killing him and another soldier.
   Traum's heart was later transplanted into a Palestinian man in
Arab east Jerusalem.
   ``For our generation it was a choice between fighting in a
tragic and badly motivated war in Vietnam or coming to Israel, to
your own country, to your own people,'' said Neil Hassid, 42, a
close friend and army buddy of Traum's.
   ``That kind of choice should have been obvious to all of us. It
was to me and it was to Ze'ev.''
   Al Liebman, the father-in-law of Joe Berniker, 35, the second
fallen soldier, lighted the memorial torch on this windswept
mountaintop forest of young cedars about 15 miles west of
Jerusalem.
   Berniker, 35, moved to Israel from New Orleans in 1974 and was a
member of a communal farm near Israel's border with Lebanon.
   Berniker was also serving in the reserves when a stray artillery
shell killed him and and four other soldiers last July during a
training exercise.
   Col. Raanan Gissin praised the North American contribution and
lauded their service to the only Jewish army in the world.
   ``I think there is a sense and a feeling that this is their
army. It is not just the army of the United States but the army of
the Jewish people,'' he said.
   For Israelis, military service is the one bonding experience
they will most likely share. But for American immigrants, who have
grown up without the draft, service can be a disconcertingly quick
access to the network that makes one fully Israeli.
   Rena Genn lost her husband, Eli Solomon, in the 1973 Yom Kippur
War after emigrating from New York City.
   She said it takes time to become part of this country ``until
one day it is not them but us.''
   ``Unfortunately, the event that made me 100 percent part of it
all was a knock on the door.''

<TEXT>
   Commanders of slain Liberian
President Samuel Doe and rebel leader Charles Taylor reportedly met
Monday in Monrovia, their nation's capital, and arranged for talks
on the cease-fire now in effect.
   It was the first such meeting since the two sides went to war
nine months ago. Taylor declared a unilateral truce that took hold
Saturday, and other warring factions have honored it.
   No contact had been reported between fighters of Taylor and
rival rebel leader Prince Johnson, or a five-nation West African
army sent to enforce a cease-fire.
   West African officials said Sunday that Taylor and Johnson will
meet Friday in Freetown, Sierra Leone, for talks with U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen. Cohen arranged the talks
in meetings with the two rebels last week, they said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported that Col.
James Freeman of Doe's mansion guard and Taylor rebel commander
Albert Zoegba Paye met on Monday 300 yards from the presidential
residence.
   ``They congratulated each other (on the truce) and broke into a
joyful discussion to the point where it was difficult to see which
one of the two commanders was more relieved,'' reported the agency,
which has a correspondent traveling with the rebels.
   It said they arranged for Taylor to meet with the commander of
Doe's presidential guard, Brig. Gen. David Nimley, on Tuesday at
City Hall, less than 100 yards from the mansion where remnants of
Doe's army have holed up.
   Taylor and Nimley both declared themselves president of Liberia
after Doe was wounded and captured by Johnson's men on Sept. 9 and
tortured to death the following day.
   Also claiming the presidency are Johnson and professor Amos
Sawyer, a former lecturer in political science at MIT who was named
head of an interim government by Liberian opposition parties,
businessmen and clergymen.
   Johnson and Nimley have agreed to proposals by the Economic
Community of West African States to install Sawyer as part of a
government that would organize fair elections.
   There was no sign Monday of the 3,000 soldiers from the
five-nation West African army the economic group sent to help
install Sawyer's government.
   Freeman told reporters the West Africans had withdrawn to their
headquarters at Monrovia port, less than four miles from the
executive mansion.
   West African planes bombed Taylor's artillery batteries Sept.
15-16 after his rebels shelled their headquarters. But they have
not engaged the forces of Doe or Johnson, which approve of the West
African plans.
   Taylor says Sawyer is a puppet of the West Africans, and
announced Sunday he was holding elections Oct. 10 for
representatives to participate in a government that he will lead.
   Tom Woewiyu, Taylor's chief spokesman, said Monday that the
government would be a temporary administration to re-establish
conditions for holding proper general elections.
   Taylor, who accused Doe of corruption and nepotism, started the
civil war on Dec. 24 when his forces invaded from Ivory Coast.
Johnson later split with Taylor and formed his own rebel faction.
More than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the fighting.

   Guatemalan religious leaders began a
dialogue in a downtown hotel with leftist guerrillas Monday in the
latest in a series of talks aimed at resolving Guatemala's
30-year-old war of insurgency.
   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, an umbrella group
for four rebel armies, was to meet for two days with 14
representatives of Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish religious
orders.
   The talks were organized in the framework of a 1987 meeting in
Esquipulas, Guatemala, at which five Central American presidents
committed themselves to ending decades-long civil wars and regional
conflicts.
   Rebel commander Gaspar Ilom said his group had come ``with the
objective of finding just and democratic solutions'' to the
situation in Guatemala, but didn't intend to stop fighting without
some hope of progress.
   ``Guatemala is worthy of a new and better destiny,'' he said.
``It would have little meaning to reach a state of peace which
consolidated recalcitrant and old-fashioned points of view.''
   Roman Catholic Bishop Alvaro Ramazini said the church was hoping
to promote further talks.

   The FBI has joined the
investigation of the murder of a political columnist for a
Vietnamese magazine who was shot to death with his wife in a
Washington suburb, a law enforcement source said Monday.
   The murders of Triet Le, 61, and his wife, Tuyet Thi Dangtran,
52, may have been committed by enemies in the Vietnamese exile
community, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Le and his wife were found shot to death Saturday night in their
car, parked outside their home, authorities said.
   The killings occurred 10 months after another employee of the
magazine was shot to death in similar execution-style fashion.
   Fairfax County police are trying to determine if there is any
link between the two killings, said spokesman Warren Carmichael.
   Le wrote feisty political columns under the pen name Tu Rua for
Tien Phon, a magazine based in Arlington, another Washington
suburb.
   Last November, Nhan Trong Do, a page designer for the magazine,
was found shot to death outside his home in Seven Corners, Va. No
arrest has been made in that case.
   Magazine staff members at the time speculated Do's slaying might
be related to Tien Phong's staunchly anti-Communist articles.
   The magazine was founded in Saigon in 1955 and moved to the
United States in 1975 after the defeat of South Vietnam by North
Vietnam. It has become controversial among its readers because of
its criticism of prominent community leaders and of actions by
North and South Vietnamese officials during the Vietnam War.
   ``Some of (Le's) criticisms were really down on people,'' said
Bach Hac Nguyen, who recently began publishing a
Vietnamese-language newspaper.
   ``He embarrassed a lot of people. But I'm shocked. A lot of
people liked the way he wrote,'' he said.
   Buy My Linh Solang, a lawyer who had been the subject of a Le
column, said, ``He abused the privilege of the media. He had more
enemies than friends.''
   Carmichael said authorities are investigating all possible
motives.
   ``Logic dictates that (the magazine) would be one of them,'' he
said.
   Neighbors said one body was lying in a pool of blood just
outside the passenger door, and the driver was shot while still at
the wheel.
   They said they could not see who was in the driver's seat.
   Members of the Vietnamese community said the couple were
returning from a barbecue.
   Le had been concerned with security from the moment he moved
into the neighborhood about 10 years ago, neighbors said.
   Their house was equipped with a security camera to monitor the
door and carport and had exterior lights that turned on whenever
sensors detected movement. A sign warned passersby of the couple's
large guard dog.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International called Tuesday for an end to
the killing, torture and arbitrary imprisonment of the world's
children.
   As world leaders prepared for this weekend's World Summit for
Children, the London-based human rights organization described
violations in 19 countries including Iraq, Israel, South Africa and
the United States.
   ``Of all the victims of human rights violations, children are
among the least able to stand up for their rights. Governments must
therefore be particularly vigilant in protecting those rights,''
Amnesty said in an appeal.
   UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, is organizing the
summit that will discuss ways of improving the lot of millions of
children whose lives are threatened by poverty, disease or
malnutrition.
   At least 60 heads of state, including President Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will meet Sept. 29-30 at the
United Nations headquarters in New York.
   Amnesty said children are used as pawns to get their parents to
turn themselves in or to make confessions, and often are victims of
political and military unrest.
   ``All too often children are victimized simply because of where
they live or who their parents are. Sometimes their age alone makes
them targets for abuse,'' it said.
   In Iraq, it said, hundreds of children had disappeared or been
tortured. ``In Iraq, too, hundreds more children have died in
chemical weapons attacks on Kurdish communities, which claimed the
lives of thousands of people,'' Amnesty said.
   In Israel, it said, Palestinian children have been victims of
rights violations ``virtually daily since the beginning of the
intefadeh,'' the Palestinian uprising.
   Of the more than 600 people shot dead by security forces, 153
have been children, Amnesty said. ``In an alarmingly high number of
incidents, the children did not appear to have been involved in any
life-threatening activity,'' it added.
   In Liberia, Amnesty said children have been among the thousands
of civilians arbitrarily killed or mutilated by government forces
and their armed opponents.
   During the states of emergency in South Africa from 1985-87, it
said, an estimated 10,000 children were detained without charge or
trial, some for more than a year.
   Amnesty said children are often deliberately targeted for rights
violations because they are seen as a social or political threat.
   ``In Brazil and Guatemala, where the number of street children
has grown dramatically in recent years ... they are tortured and
extrajudicially executed by police ... often in the name of
`cleaning up the streets','' Amnesty said.
   In China, it said, children were among more than 1,000 people
killed when troops fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing
in June 1989.
   The international rights group said the United States was one of
seven countries that has reportedly executed minors the past 10
years.
   The United States ``has 35 prisoners on death row who were under
18 when they committed their crime. One such prisoner, Dalton
Prejean, was executed this year,'' Amnesty said.
   Amnesty also gave examples of violations in Albania, Argentina,
Bolivia, Chad, El Salvador, Mauritania, Burma, Nigeria, Peru,
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Turkey.

   Saddam Hussein may have Kuwait, but he
doesn't have his bomb-proof, $300,000 armored Cadillac limousine.
   The black limo, fitted with tear gas dispensers and bulletproof
tires, is being held at a repair shop in this Detroit suburb on
order of the U.S. Customs Service, agents announced Monday in
Chicago.
   ``We have reason to believe that this car might have been used
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,'' said Donald Watson, Customs'
assistant commissioner of enforcement in Chicago. ``In any case,
he's not going to get it back.''
   The Customs Service titled its press release on the car, ``Is
Saddam Hussein walking?''
   The Customs Service said it ordered the car held under authority
of President Bush's executive order freezing Iraqi assets in the
United States.
   The government of Iraqbought the car in 1988 from O'Gara-Hess &amp;
Eisenhardt, a maker of armored vehicles in Cincinnati, the Customs
Service said.
   It said the car, shipped to Baghdad in November 1988, is
bomb-proof, able to withstand military rifle blasts and is equipped
with bullet-proof tires and tear-gas dispensers.
   The limo was returned to this country in June for routine
maintenance and was ordered held in Livonia, where its engine is
being rebuilt by E.C.S. Roush Co.

   A 19-year-old man was charged with
involuntary manslaughter after moonshine killed a 13-year-old girl
and left seven other teen-agers hospitalized, authorities said
Monday.
   Six youths remained at area hospitals Monday. At least nine
others received medical treatment after drinking the illegal
whiskey, but were not hospitalized, officials said.
   Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said more arrests were
expected in adjacent Harrion County, where investigators believed
the alcohol was made.
   Officials said the moonshine, made of ethanol and methanol, was
served at a party Friday or Saturday night.
   McCort said Jody Morris, 19, of Jewett, was charged with
involuntary manslaughter in the death of 13-year-old Jami Krenzlak
of Bethesda, a freshmen at Union Local High School.
   Morris did not make the alcohol but allegedly sold it at the
party, McCort said.
   Richard Doan, spokesman for Barnesville Hospital, said Miss
Krenzlak was dead on arrival Sunday evening.
   McCort said alcohol made illegally in this area of eastern Ohio
is usually a mixture of ethanol and a small amount of methanol,
added for taste. The ratio was apparently reversed in the lethal
batch, he said.
   Methanol, or methyl alcohol, also known as wood alcohol, can
shut down the liver and kidneys and cause blindness and death. It
is used in automobile fuel and copying machine fluid.
   Ethanol is a corn-based alcohol.

   David Cowper sailed into the
River Tyne on Monday to end a four-year around-the-world voyage
that included the first solo navigation of the Northwest Passage.
   The 48-year-old British surveyor was greeted by a flotilla of
small craft, a band playing Rule Britannia and a flag-waving crowd
as his converted former lifeboat moored in Newcastle upon Tyne on
England's northeast coast.
   Cowper holds three records in The Guinness Book of Records 1990
for previous circumnavigations of the globe. A Guinness spokeswoman
said the publisher was awaiting information on his latest trip to
see if there would be a new record.
   Cowper's 30,000-mile journey in the 42-foot converted lifeboat
Mabel E. Holland took more than 50 months, making it the slowest of
his four lone circumnavigations since 1979.
   He opted to reach the Pacific via the frozen waters of the
2,200-mile Northwest Passage around the Arctic coasts of Canada and
Alaska but was stopped three times by the winter.
   ``It has been a most rousing welcome which gave me quite a lump
in my throat. I am most relieved to get the boat back - at times I
feared she wouldn't make it,'' he said.
   Despite facing numerous dangers, Cowper hinted his taste for
epic travel had not been satisfied, but he said he was keeping his
next venture a secret in case anyone else beats him to it.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday that South Africa's
campaign to abolish white supremacist rule is irreversible and
assured President F.W. de Klerk that he would oppose new conditions
for lifting economic sanctions.
   ``These conditions are clear-cut and are not open to
re-interpretation. And I do not believe in moving the goalposts,''
Bush said, referring to requirements South Africa must fulfill
before the sanctions will be suspended. The sanctions were imposed
in 1986 over then President Reagan's veto.
   Bush also said all political groups in South Africa ``have a
special responsibility to support the process of peaceful
transition.''
   De Klerk, the first South African leader to visit the United
States since 1945, assured Bush that the process of reform is
irreversible, and Bush echoed that sentiment.
   ``We will not turn back,'' de Klerk said.
   The leaders met at the White House for two hours, first in the
Oval Office and again over lunch. The meeting was a showcase of
U.S. political support for de Klerk's efforts to guide South Africa
toward a post-apartheid democratic system.
   Later, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Bush's characterization
of the dismantling of apartheid as ``irreversible'' should help
persuade European governments to lift sanctions.
   He said he understood the Bush administration would have
difficulty in changing sanctions written into law by Congress.
   ``Wre are aware of the sensitivities constraining the U.S.
administration and we are not here to as the U.S. to do anything
about it at this stage,'' Botha said.
   More than 100 anti-apartheid demonstrators marched outside the
White House during the visit.
   ``Bush is an accomplice to a colossal public relations fraud
which attempts to portray F.W. de Klerk as a moderate reformer,''
said Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a private
anti-apartheid group.
   Robinson said de Klerk's trip ``sends a false and dangerous
message that South Africa is on its way to change.''
   Bush praised de Klerk at a farewell ceremony in front of the
sun-drenched South Lawn.
   ``Clearly, the time has come to encourage and assist the
emerging new South Africa,'' Bush said. Behind the leaders, a black
Marine held the flag of South Africa; a white Marine held the
American flag.
   But Bush said that despite ``the dramatic progress that we
salute here today,'' South Africa hasn't moved far enough to meet
the conditions for removing economic sanctions.
   South Africa has not released all political prisoners and has
not lifted the state of emergency in the Natal province. Further,
it has not repealed a population registration act that requires
citizens to be classified by race - a key part of the apartheid
system.
   On the other hand, Bush said, ``the move away from apartheid
toward a new political reality is indeed irreversible and much has
already happened.''
   Bush's statement goes beyond the assessment of most European
leaders.
   ``I don't think it's that far ahead. ... I imagine that by the
end of the year, they (European leaders) will have reached that
conclusion,'' Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said at
briefing for reporters.
   Cohen said the United States accepts the conclusion that South
Africa won't repeal the population registration measure until
apartheid is totally dismantled.
   Bush, he said, could act to suspend or modify sanctions if all
other conditions are met.
   Bush cited the release from prison of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, the removal of outlaw status for the African
National Congress, plans to release remaining political prisoners
and removal of media restraints as improvements.
   ``Who among us, only a year ago, would have anticipated these
remarkable developments?'' Bush asked.
   De Klerk promised Bush his government would replace its white
supremacist system with a new structure with ``a vote of equal
value to all South Africans.''
   Bush and de Klerk both noted that the process of reform has been
plagued by a recent upsurge in black-against-black violence in
South African townships. The death toll is estimated at about 750.
   Bush urged South African blacks to cooperate during the period
of transition.
   ``The government has a special responsibility to maintain
order,'' Bush said, ``but all political parties and groups have a
special responsibility to support the process of peaceful
transition.''
   Mandela has sought to blame pro-apartheid security elements of
the police and military for recent violence, a possibility South
African officials don't dismiss.
   In his remarks, de Klerk praised Bush for his leadership in the
Persian Gulf crisis and said South Africa would support him.

<HEAD>More Deadly Attacks by Shining Path Guerrillas in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas of the radical Shining Path
movement murdered five militiamen and looted and burned houses in
their village, police said Monday.
   The rebels also assassinated a former government minister and
kidnapped a congressman in Lima over the weekend. About 30 people
have died in the last two weeks of a decade-old war that has
claimed about 20,000 lives.
   The militiamen were slain Sunday night after about 100 rebels
swept into tiny San Juan de la Vinaca, high in the Andes about 230
miles southeast of Lima. Four others were injured and houses were
burned, police said.
   The attack was typical of actions carried out by the Shining
Path, which hopes to dissuade peasants, through terror, from taking
up arms against it.
   The Shining Path is fighting for a radical transformation of
Peru into a peasant-controlled society. Many of its victims have
been peasants believed to support the government.
   Five other rural people died and three were kidnapped in two
separate rebel attacks near Huancayo, an Andean city 120 miles east
of Lima, police said.
   On Saturday night, former Labor Minister Orestes Rodriguez and
his 22-year-old son were assassinated.
   On Sunday, the Shining Path kidnapped Gerardo Lopez, a
congressman for the Cambio 90 movement of President Alberto
Fujimori, who took office in July.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Compares Mohawk Standoff Site to Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson made a quick one-day trip Monday
to the Montreal area to gather material for a U S. TV report on the
Mohawk land dispute crisis at Oka, and compared the standoff in
Quebec to Kuwait.
   ``Military occupation is military occupation,'' he said.
   He was referring to Canadian army control in Kahnesatake that
includes limiting news media activities and allowing into a nearby
drug and alcohol treatment center - where the army has penned in
about 50 Indians - only as much food and supplies as deemed
necessary.
   Jackson, a civil rights activist and politician, mingled with
locals at the Kahnesatake food bank, but was kept from talking to
the natives at the treatment center there.
   Maj. John Paul Macdonald of the Canadian Forces said Jackson was
treated like any other journalist and refused entry to the
compound, which has been sealed to reporters for two weeks.
   Jackson complained, ``When the free press is cut off and denied
access to all parties involved, then it undercuts the character of
democracy. Both sides here are interested in face-saving, honor and
dignity. But, somehow, face-saving has to give way to life-saving
and communications must be resumed.''
   The black activist wore a trenchcoat in the cold, rainy weather
and carried a notepad, but spent much of his time shaking hands,
kissing babies and signing autographs.
   He was accompanied by Grand Chief Joe Norton of the Kahnawake
Mohawk reserve and a dozen other people, including a production
crew from his syndicated television show in the United States.
However, he left many Canadians confused as to just what he hoped
to accomplish in the confrontation between Mohawks and authorities.
   Jackson visited the food bank in the Mohawk community after
being turned back at the treatment center. He refused to say he was
in the Montreal area in any negotiating capacity, but suggested his
experience might be ``a factor in facilitating an end to this
impasse.''
   The dispute arose over plans by Oka community, 18 miles west of
Montreal, to expand a golf course onto land the Mohawks claim as
ancestral. Mohawks and police fought a gun battle on July 11 when
police tried to tear down an Indian barricade. An officer was
killed, but blame in the death has not been fixed.
   Jackson's credentials include a trip to Syria in 1984, where he
persuaded President Hafez Assad to release an American navy pilot
who had been shot down by the Syrian air force.
   The American black leader also went to Premier Robert Bourassa's
office. However, the premier wasn't there and Jackson ended up
speaking to his chief of staff, John Parisella, and Native Affairs
Minister John Ciaccia.

<TEXT>
   Iranian authorities arrested 29 smugglers
trying to move foodstuffs across the border into Iraq to circumvent
the U.N.-imposed embargo, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said they were members of two
gangs that usually are involved in smuggling other contraband
across the mountainous border in northwestern Kurdistan province.
   The smugglers were delivered Sunday to an Islamic revolutionary
court in Sanandaj, capital of Iranian Kurdistan, the news agency
said. It said police seized rice, dates, raisins, tomato sauce,
vegetable oil, flour, sugar and powdered milk.
   Iran has announced it will enforce economic sanctions imposed by
the United Nations after Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   But Tehran newspapers have also suggested Iran may send
``humanitarian shipments'' of food and medicine to Iraq, its foe in
the 1980-88 gulf war. Under most interpretations, such shipments
would be exempted from the sanctions.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad was completing a four-day visit to
Tehran on Monday.

<HEAD>Newspaper Questions AZT Study; AIDS Advocate Wants Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A news story raising questions about clinical
trials that led to widespread use of the anti-AIDS drugs AZT
touched off a flap here Monday, with one activist calling for a
federal probe.
   The Miami Herald's Tropic Magazine published a story Sunday on
the role of Dr. Margaret Fischl, a prominent researcher who helps
run the University of Miami AIDS program, in the 1987 study that
brought AZT to prominence.
   The article quoted some researchers as criticizing the methods
used in the study, questioning the accuracy of the figures, and
suggesting that AZT's effectiveness was overrated by the doctor.
   ``We demand a suspension of her official activities and a
complete investigation of her and her involvement with Burroughs
Wellcome,'' activist Bob Kunst, director of Miami-based Cure AIDS
Now, said Monday. ``This is just a monstrous conspiracy - openly,
fraudulently misleading the public on AZT.''
   Kunst noted Ms. Fischl sits on the 10-member AIDS Clinical
Trials Group, which directs the government's $100 million research
effort, and said he has written Congress asking for an
investigation.
   He said his group, along with many others AIDS-victim advocates,
has not promoted AZT use for several years, saying the benefits
appear to disappear quickly and that side effects are deadly.
   Ms. Fischl has connections with the British company making AZT,
Burroughs Wellcome, which chose her to run the clinical trials
here, the newspaper said.
   Ms. Fischl denied any impropriety in the study or her relations
with Burroughs Wellcome.
   ``I do not own stock in pharmaceutical companies,'' she said.
``I have never gotten a `kickback' from Burroughs Wellcome, if
that's the terminology.''
   The University of Miami-run Jackson Memorial Hospital, where the
trials were run, did not immediately respond to the article Monday.
   Dr. Bernard Fogel, dean of the UM medical school, strongly
defended Ms. Fischl, saying she gets a flat $120,000 salary through
the school, and receives no direct payments from Burroughs
Wellcome.
   Ms. Fischl was principal author of first research published on
AZT and now promotes the drugs in television spots and literature
distrubuted to physicians by Burroughs Wellcome, the article said.
The researcher, whose work attracts $10 million in government and
private grants for the university, said she isn't compensated for
the endorsements.
   The Herald Tropic story detailed what it said were numerous
questions about the 1987 study, which Ms. Fischl interrupted after
saying the initial results were so striking that it would have been
immoral to continue giving placebos to half the subjects. Much of
the criticism has been aired previously at scientific conferences.
   The initial positive results for AZT may have been the result of
blood transfusions given along with the drug, Dr. Joseph Sonnabend
said in the article. The South African researcher who was among the
first to study AIDS.
   Ellen Cooper, medical researcher with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration who analyzed Fischl's AZT study in 1987, expressed
concern that subjects were being treated with numerous other drugs.
That would violate normal scientific procedures and cloud the
conclusions, she said.
   The article said the final death toll of patients using AZT was
far higher than in the initial announcements. An ongoing Veterans
Administration study and a European study published in Science
magazine have failed to confirm the Fischl study's results, the
newspaper said.
   The newspaper said Ms. Fischl claimed that the study was a
double-blind, meaning neither the patients nor those giving the
drug knew who was receiving AZT. But researchers have now
acknowledged that they knew which patients received AZT, because
lab blood tests clearly showed the difference, and the drug, which
causes anemia, required that recipients undergo transfusions, the
Herald said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, running for
re-election against a Democrat seeking to become the state's first
black governor, has won the endorsement of South Carolina's black
mayors.
   The South Carolina Conference of Black Mayors endorsed Campbell,
a Republican, at a conference last week attended by 20 black
mayors.
   In delivering the endorsement for Campbell, the mayors spurned
state Sen. Theo Mitchell, who is black.
   Mitchell said he wasn't surprised Campbell received the
endorsements, and chalked it up to practical politics.
   Campbell ``is the man who has the power; this is the man who has
doled out grants; this is the man who put some money in some of the
hands of some of the mayors to address their problems,'' Mitchell
said.
   Mayor Joe Montgomery of Atlantic Beach echoed Mitchell's
assessment, saying he supported Campbell ``because of what he's
done and what he can do. He's helped our towns, and based on his
record, we're going to support him. I'll tell Theo that.''
   Mayor Franklin B. Goodwin of Santee said Campbell ``is doing a
lot for the state. He's given us opportunity.'' As for Mitchell,
Goodwin said, ``Theo ... never did contact me.''

<HEAD>Tutu: de Klerk Deserves Credit But Sanctions Should Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM CURRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archibishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he
hoped President Bush would encourage South African President F. W.
de Klerk to ``get on with the business'' of negotiating an end to
white rule.
   ``I think they really ought to get into the negotiating mode
quickly because that's the only way in which results will happen
which will then lead to the lifting of sanctions,'' the South
African prelate said after receiving an honorary degree from the
University of Missouri-Kansas City.
   De Klerk, the first South African leader to visit the United
States since 1945, met with Bush Monday in Washington.
   Tutu praised de Klerk's reforms as steps toward dismantling
South Africa's apartheid, a system of racial separation under which
the country's black majority is ruled by the white minority.
   ``It is important that some recognition be given for the things
he has done, and recognition for his courage,'' said Tutu, who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his work against his country's
system of racial separation.
   However, Tutu said it was too early to ease U.S. economic
sanctions against South Africa. The sanctions helped push de Klerk
toward change, he said.
   In Washington Monday, Bush said that despite dramatic progress,
South Africa has not met conditions for ending the sanctions.
   Among de Klerk's reforms was the legalization of the African
National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. In February, ANC
leader Nelson Mandela was freed after more than 27 years in prison.

   World leaders opened a U.N. General Assembly session Monday by
condemning Iraq as a warlike state for its invasion of Kuwait, as
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed to fight for ``a thousand
years'' to keep the oil-rich emirate.
   While the world body prepared to tighten sanctions on Iraq, the
economic repercussions of the Persian Gulf crisis spread and
strengthened.
   Oil prices closed at a record $38.25 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where oil futures have been traded since 1983. Gasoline
and home heating oil both topped $1 a gallon. The International
Monetary Fund, meanwhile, moved to help poor countries whose
economies are being devastated by the conflict.
   The stock market in New York fell to a 14-month low Monday,
battered by rising oil prices and trouble in the banking industry.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 59.41 points to 2,452.97.
   French President Francois Mitterrand delivered the first of a
series of condemnations of Iraq, warning that Iraq's aggression
could lead to global anarchy.
   Leaders from Brazil, Argentina, Poland and Indonesia joined the
chorus of condemnation that opened the 45th session of the General
Assembly, while the Iraqi U.N. ambassador watched in silence. The
speakers set the stage for a Security Council vote Tuesday on
extending sanctions against Iraq to include an air embargo.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze speaks Tuesday, and
President Bush is to address the 160-member assembly next Monday.
   Bush said in Washington on Monday ``I'm not going to be
distracted'' by Saddam's efforts to link the crisis with the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   ``First we've got to take care of the situation that exists
right now, naked aggression of one country against the other. That
cannot be permitted to stand,'' Bush told a group of Arab-American
leaders in Washington.
   Saddam has suggested one way to ease the crisis would be for
Israel to leave the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, was to address the United
Nations the same day as Bush, but he has insisted on traveling to
New York aboard Iraq's flag carrier, Iraqi Airways. The United
States has not approved landing rights.
   In Washington, the State Department said Aziz had U.S.
permission to attend the U.N. session. But it was not clear what
was meant by the U.S. decision, reported by department spokeswoman
V. Kim Hoggard, to allow Aziz to come to the United States
``commercially.''
   Iraq said Monday it had rebuffed an offer from the United States
to allow the plane to land - if Baghdad releases more than 1,000
Americans being held in Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion.
   ``Iraq categorically rejects any link between this issue and any
other issue,'' said the official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus.
   State Department officials said they had no knowledge of such a
claim by Iraq.
   Aziz was not on hand as Mitterrand assailed the Baghdad
government and said the international community would not retreat
from its demand that Iraq give up Kuwait.
   ``How could we not be disgusted by the taking of thousands of
hostages?'' Mitterrand asked, referring to the 290 French citizens
and other Westerners being held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   France, a former friend and arms merchant to Iraq, sent 4,000
troops to the gulf region after Iraqi soldiers raided the French
ambassador's residence in Kuwait on Sept. 14. About a dozen foreign
missions in the emirate are still resisting a month-old Iraqi order
to close down.
   Iraq on Sunday offered a belated apology for the raid. It was
spurned by France.
   ``Excuses are fine,'' Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said on
French radio, ``but we're waiting for Iraq to let captive Frenchmen
leave in a normal manner.''
   At the United Nations, Mitterrand pointed to the dangers posed
by the ``expansionist determination of one man, of one warlike
state.''
   ``In order to prevent this anarchy and theory of might makes
right ... I can't find any other answer than the rule of law, of
right,'' he said.
   The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Tuesday on what
would be the strictest resolution yet against Iraq. It would block
all air traffic in and out of Iraq except for planes carrying
humanitarian aid.
   Iraq warned Sunday it might target Israel and the oil fields of
the Mideast if it is ``strangled'' by the sanctions and other steps
against it. Israel said Monday it took the threat seriously, and
warned Saddam not to underestimate its readiness to react.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israelis were ready to
``confront, prevent and ... defend ourselves'' against Iraq.
   Saddam, meanwhile, accused the United States of being the
aggressor in the gulf crisis.
   ``America poses a threat to mankind, emerging as a new tyranny
in the world,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as
telling a group of Islamic theologians. Saddam also insisted his
armies would never pull back.
   ``Kuwait belongs to Iraq and we will never give it up even if we
have to fight over it for a thousand years,'' he said.
   The global sanctions aimed at driving Iraq out of Kuwait are
hurting other countries by depriving them of trade with Baghdad.
The IMF on Monday approved an accelerated effort to supply billions
of dollars to help them.
   The communique from IMF's policy-making interim committee gave
no specifics on how much money would be forthcoming, but U.S.
officials have said Egypt, Jordan and Turkey alone would need up to
$16 billion in assistance through the end of next year.
   In other gulf-related developments Monday:
   -A convoy of 30 trucks loaded with food rolled out of Amman,
Jordan's capital, bound for Baghdad with horns honking and flags
flying. Hundreds of Jordanians cheered the violation of the U.N.
embargo that bans shipments to Iraq unless cleared by the Security
Council. The convoy was a symbol of the support Iraq enjoys in
Jordan.
   -Iraq tightened its grip on Kuwait by abolishing the country's
currency and replacing it with Iraqi dinars. The Iraqi currency is
not convertible on the international market.
   -Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Syrian
President Hafez Assad was extending his stay in Tehran. Assad,
Saddam's archenemy, came to Iran for talks that were to include
inquiries about the Western hostages in Lebanon and Iran's
intentions regarding the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq.
   -Three Indian ships, including one carrying food and medical
supplies, docked at Umm Qasr in southern Iraq, shipping executives
reported. They are to begin shuttling 100,000 stranded Indian
nationals to the Persian Gulf port of Dubai.

   Potential jurors in an obscenity trial
involving Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photos were asked
Monday whether they look at Playboy magazine or attend arts
fund-raisers.
   Many questioned during the first day of jury selection said
they'd seen such adult magazines as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler,
but said they didn't subscribe. None acknowledged having taken an
art class or attending a fund-raiser for the arts.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
were charged in April with pandering obscenity and displaying nude
photos of children. The photographs were from the exhibit ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''
   The seven-week exhibition of photographs by Mapplethorpe, who
died of AIDS in March 1989, attracted a record crowd of more than
80,000 people to the gallery last spring.
   About 150 gay-rights and anti-censorship demonstrators protested
the trial outside the Hamilton County Courthouse from mid-morning
through the noon hour Monday. They sometimes disrupted traffic, but
there were no arrests.
   The charges are both misdemeanors. If conviced, Barrie, 43,
faces a possible fine of $1,000 and six months in jail on each
count. The gallery could be fined $5,000 on each count.
   A panel of eight jurors and two alternates will be chosen to
hear the trial in Hamilton County Municipal Court. Jury selection
was expected to continue through Tuesday, with testimony lasting
into next week.
   A pool of 50 prospective jurors was assembled Monday, but
attorneys got less than halfway through questioning the first group
of eight.
   ``Would you avoid a homosexual art display?'' the gallery's
attorney, Marc Mezibov, asked one prospective juror.
   ``I wouldn't put out money to see homosexual art,'' the man
responded.
   Mezibov also told prospective jurors that testimony will deal
with Mapplethorpe's homosexuality.
   Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked prospective jurors whether they
had seen Playboy, Penthouse or Hustler magazines and whether they
had taken art classes or attended an arts fund-raiser.
   Judge David Albanese asked all 50 prospective jurors if they had
any personal contact with the art community. One person said she
was a member of the Contemporary Arts Center, and three said they
had seen the exhibit.
   Protesters outside denounced the trial as homophobic
intimidation.
   They chanted, ``Art on trial,'' and carried signs that said,
``Stop gay bashing'' and ``Art today, your bedroom tomorrow.''
   Demonstrators, accompanied by mounted police, walked 10 blocks
through downtown, twice passing the gallery. Some people lay in the
street, briefly halting traffic.
   Catherine Adams, a lawyer for Gay-Lesbian March Activists, said
she told city and county authorities last week that some members of
the group had AIDS. About 50 officers, some of them wearing rubber
gloves, set up barricades and patrolled the area.
   A grand jury indicted Barrie and the gallery, concluding that
seven of the 175 Mapplethorpe photos violated community standards.
One photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Others
show oral sex and anal penetration with objects.
   Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Association of Art Museum Directors have said this is the first
case they know of an obscenity prosecution of an art museum.
   Albanese denied a defense motion to declare a mistrial based on
pretrial news reports, particularly use of phrases such as ``child
pornography.''
   He also denied a motion to limit potential jurors to Cincinnati
residents. Because of the structure of the Hamilton County
Municipal Court, the jury pool is drawn from residents of
Cincinnati and its suburbs.
   The judge denied a motion to allow individual questioning of
potential jurors and denied a defense request to increase the
number of pre-emptory challenges.

   A gas truck overturned and exploded at
a busy Bangkok intersection, engulfing cars, shops and a women's
dormitory in flames that killed at least 44 people, police said
Tuesday.
   Another 97 were injured, many seriously, said Col. Wanlop
Watjanapooka, the deputy commander of northern Bangkok police.
   He said the 10-wheel truck overturned near the railway crossing
at New Petchburi Road shortly after 10 p.m. Monday. Liquified gas
gushed out of its tanks and burst into flames that swept over 43
cars and a total of 30 shops and other buildings on both sides of
the street, including the dormitory.
   There was no immediate information on where most of the 44
fatalities occurred.
   It also was not immediately known how the truck overturned.

   A 5-year-old boy died Monday after being
shot by his toddler brother while they played ``cowboys and
Indians'' with loaded pistols, police said.
   Changxue Thao died at University of Wisconsin Hospital in
Madison of wounds inflicted when his two-year-old brother,
Vangleng, shot him in the forehead with a .22-caliber revolver
Sunday night, police said.
   The shooting took place in an upstairs bedroom where the loaded
guns had been hidden. The boys had been punished once earlier this
month for playing with the guns, police said.
   ``It looks like the two kids were playing cowboys and Indians
when one of the guns went off,'' Police Inspector Gerald
Christianson said.
   The boys' parents, Xay and Seng Thao, were out. A 15-year-old
sister was downstairs watching three other children when the
shooting took place, police said.
   Marathon County District Attorney Greg Grau said he didn't
expect to file charges in the case but would make a final decision
once the investigation and autopsy are completed.

international community would not retreat from its demand that the
Iraqis give up Kuwait.
   He and other speakers set the stage for a Security Council vote

   He said ``if Iraq were to withdraw its troops and free the
hostages, everything might be possible'' - and suggested that other
areas of discord in the Middle East could be helped toward peace.
   Leaders from Brazil, Argentina, Poland and Indonesia joined the
chorus of condemnation of Iraq that opened the 45th session of the
General Assembly, while the Iraqi ambassador watched in silence.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati broadened his
criticism to include the United States, saying its military buildup
was aimed at backing imperial U.S. designs - not defending the
nations of the Persian Gulf.
   The French president flew to New York on the Concorde for a
brief appearance here, speaking in French through a translator.
   Mitterrand told the 159-nation General Assembly, ``Let us be
clear about this. There is no compromise as long as Iraq does not
comply with resolutions of the Security Council and withdraw from
Kuwait. The sovereignty of that country is not negotiable.''
   He later held out the possibility of peace, outlining these
three general steps toward that goal:
   -Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and freeing of thousands of
Westerners held captive by Iraq;
   -International guarantees for withdrawal of foreign military
forces, restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait and the
democratic will of the Kuwaiti people;
   -``Replacing confrontation with the dynamics of good
neighborliness and security and peace for each country.''
   He said this could ultimately spread a spirit of reconciliation
to Lebanon, the Palestinian people and Israel but did not
elaborate.
   Mitterrand also said a later stage would involve agreed mutual
reductions of armaments in the area.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters they expected the air embargo
resolution to be adopted Tuesday.
   ``We want action. There is no other way,'' Shevardnadze said
through a translator.
   Hurd, asked about recent bellicose comments by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, said: ``His statements will remain uncompromising
until the day he decides to leave Kuwait, or he is thrown out of
Kuwait.''
   On Sunday, Saddam hinted he would make Mideast oil fields and
Israel his targets if Iraqis were ``strangled'' by sanctions and
other steps.
   Shevardnadze called those comments ``inadmissable'' and added:
``Any attacks would unleash a war and that would mean disaster.''
   The Security Council on Monday adopted a brief resolution
calling for aid to about a dozen nations suffering economic
hardship as a result of the embargo against Iraq.
   Mitterrand, whose government has denounced Iraq for invading
French and other diplomatic premises in Kuwait, was unsparing in
his condemnation of the Baghdad government.
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, listened
impassively from his seat as the French president spoke.
   Iraq has apologized to France for the raid on its ambassador's
residence, but Mitterrand rejected Iraq's apology, saying Saddam
has offered ``not one gesture, not one word'' to defuse the crisis.
   He said French ships and troops would remain in the Persian Gulf
until ``our mission is accomplished.''
   The United States has not given its permission for an Iraqi
Airways flight to land in New York with an Iraqi delegation from
Baghdad. U.S. officials have advised them to take commercial
flights instead, Iraq said.
   Aziz said in Baghdad that his government would not participate
in the three-week debate of world speakers because of the U.S.
restrictions.
   Iraq said Monday it had rejected a U.S. offer to allow the plane
to land in exchange for the freeing of Westerners, including 1,000
Americans, trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   In his speech, Mitterrand said Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
is an example of the ``law of the jungle.''
   ``How could we not be disgusted by the taking of thousands of
hostages?'' he asked. ``Kuwait is a sovereign state, a member of
the international community. In the name of what can one decide
that this state has ceased to exist? In the name of the law of
planes, tanks and trucks?''
   The French president warned that neighboring nations were
endangered by the ``warlike state'' of Iraq.
   The assembly's annual parade of world leaders, which began
Monday, was dominated by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello, the first speaker,
said the crisis ``presents an unexpected and serious threat to
collective peace.''

mission statement that focuses on freedom of information issues.
   The Industry Advisory Committee will deliver its report to the
SPJ board of directors at the society's annual convention next

<HEAD>Washington Post Defends Reporter Arrested While Working on Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The managing editor of The Washington Post
says a reporter broke no law when he was arrested for allegedly
contributing to the delinquency of a minor while working on a
story.
   ``I'm particularly concerned that the police pursued this after
the reporter identified himself and his purpose, and that the
police took his notes,'' said Managing Editor Leonard Downie, Jr.
   Michael J. Ybarra, 23, a reporter with the Post's Metro staff
was arrested late Sept. 21 while working on a report about a new
curfew for minors in Quantico, Va.
   He was taken into custody and his notes confiscated while
conducting an interview of two 12-year-old boys in a restaurant in
the Virginia town about 30 miles south of the nation's capital.
   The Quantico Town Council recently imposed a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the
area.
   Ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew
violation, but no youths have been arrested.
   ``I believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just
got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time,'' said Leo
Rodriguez, Quantico's police chief.
   Rodriguez said the reporter's notes were held as evidence but a
copy would be made available to the Post.
   Ybarra, who was released on his own recognizance, is to be
arraigned in Prince William County Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court on Sept. 25. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year
in jail and a $2,500 fine.
   Ybarra's supervisors said the reporter was not available for
comment.

<HEAD>Iowa High Court Backs Sales Tax Exemption for Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law applying Iowa's 4 percent sales
tax to magazines while exempting newspapers was upheld by the state
Supreme Court.
   The court found ``no censorial threat, motive, or element''
imposed by the state's tax policy and rejected a constitutional
challenge by Hearst Corp., publisher of Cosmopolitan, Good
Housekeeping, Popular Mechanics, Harper's Bazaar, Sports Afield and
Town and Country.
   ``The focus is not on the content of the journalism,'' the court
said Sept. 19. ``Rather, the form and frequency of the publication
are the primary factors for determining whether a publication
qualifies for the Iowa sales and use tax exemption.''
   Hearst had argued the tax law violated First Amendment
guarantees of freedom of the press. Giving the state the power to
tax different publications at different levels or to exempt some
amounts to granting censorship powers, the company argued.
   Under Iowa tax laws, newspapers do not pay the 4 percent sales
tax that magazines and other periodicals are required to pay.
   Regulations spell out the definitions of ``magazine'' and
``newspaper'' for tax purposes, the most crucial centering on how
often they are published.
   The court conceded a tax exemption is a government subsidy but
said legislators were within their rights in providing such a
subsidy as long as it doesn't discriminate between similar media
and ``is not impermissibly directed at a publication's content.''
   Hearst also had said the tax policy violated equal protection
provisions, but the court rejected that argument, saying that while
legislators cannot use a taxing power to block press organizations,
they are not required to help them either.
   ``The constitution does not require that the government remove
all obstacles in the path of the exercise of a person's rights,''
said the opinion. ``Where government subsidies are not aimed at the
suppression of dangerous ideas, its power to encourage actions
deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader.''
   Hearst also contended the tax law favored Iowa-based companies,
but the court rejected that, saying newspapers were exempt from the
tax no matter where they were published.

   A city councilman was charged with
attacking and choking a newspaper reporter during a public meeting
at a community center, police said.
   Council Vice Chairman Yusuf Hakeem, 41, was arrested and charged
with assault Sept. 20 after he allegedly grabbed Carl Patton by the
throat during the meeting.
   The incident occurred at the Carver Community Center and was
witnessed by those at the meeting, where Hakeem was explaining
council decisions to people in his district.
   Witnesses said Hakeem became upset at persistent questions from
Patton, who writes for the Chattanooga News Weekly.
   Hakeem was arrested on a warrant signed by Patton and was
released on $500 bond.
   Patton's paper has been critical of Hakeem in news stories and
editorials.
   Hakeem was among four blacks elected last spring to the new
nine-member City Council after a federal judge declared the old
five-member City Commission discriminatory.
   Patton, who also is black, unsuccessfully ran for mayor in the

<HEAD>Audio, Video Equipment Banned at Neil Bush Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators say audio and video recording
equipment won't be allowed at the Sept. 25 public hearing on Neil
Bush's role in the failure of Silverado Banking savings and loan.
   Bush, who faces charges that he acted improperly as a director
of Silverado, was scheduled to testify. He was an outside director
of Silverado from 1985 until shortly before the thrift was seized
by regulators in 1988.
   Bush has been accused of conflicts of interest in his dealings
with former developers Ken Good and Bill Walters, two major
Silverado borrowers.
   The decision not to allow recording equipment angered Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo., and the Colorado Broadcasters Association.
   Dan Buck, an administrative assistant to Schroeder, said he
understood the federal Office of Thrift Supervision wanting to
avoid turning the hearing into a circus. ``But the taxpayers have
already bought $1 billion worth of ducats to the Silverado failure,
and they should be able to see the investigative process,'' he
said.
   Past administrative hearings have been closed to the public
entirely. In July, because of interest in the national savings and
loan fiasco, the policy was changed, but recording devices still
are not permitted at Office of Thrift Supervision hearings.
   The broadcasters' association sent a letter to the agency's
director, Timothy Ryan, requesting at least one television camera
inside the Neil Bush hearing.
   The association also asked Ryan to move the hearing from
Denver's federal courthouse building, where video equipment never
is permitted. He suggested other hearing sites that allow cameras,
including the University of Denver and state and county courtrooms.
   ``The broadcast media makes a judgment in terms of what they
believe the public is most interested in,'' said Andrew Low, an
attorney for the association and KUSA-TV in Denver.
   ``It is beyond question that Neil Bush's involvement in the
failure of Silverado is of considerable public interest,
particularly in Colorado where Neil Bush lives,'' Low said.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Says Budget Hearings May Delay Cable Bill Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to re-regulate the cable television
industry may not get a final vote by Congress this year, the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission told broadcasters
Sept. 18.
   Alfred C. Sikes said the continuing House-Senate negotiations on
the federal budget could cause the delay. The House has passed a
cable bill but a vote on a similar measure in the Senate still is
pending.
   He made the remarks in responding to questions posed at a lunch
held by the International Radio and Television Society in New York.
   Only a month ago, Sikes said, he would have said he felt ``there
was a substantial likelihood'' of a final vote by both houses this
year.
   But now, ``I think that in some ways the fate of the cable
legislation is tied to (federal) budget negotiations,'' he said.
   As the talks drag on and if negotiators ``tighten the rules on
floor action in Congress, it would seem to me that the cable
legislation will run out of time'' for a final vote before the
current session of Congress ends, he said.
   The Bush administration strongly opposes the House bill, saying
Congress should instead encourage new forms of competition to
cable. That industry was largely freed of regulation by Congress in
1984.
   Among other things, the House measure, passed in response to
increasing complaints about overpricing and shoddy cable TV
service, would impose federal price limits on basic cable service.
   It also would give the FCC power to order price rollbacks on the
worst offenders and boost competition to cable, which now serves
58.9 percent of the nation's 93.1 million homes with TV, according
to Nielsen estimates.

<HEAD>Newton Will Appeal NBC Libel Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wayne Newton asked a federal appeals court to
reconsider a ruling that overturned his record $5.2 million libel
judgment against NBC News for a 1980 broadcast linking him to
organized crime.
   Lawyers for Newton said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
``overlooked or misconstrued'' some evidence and interpreted other
evidence unfairly in favor of NBC in its Aug. 30 ruling.
   In a petition asking for a rehearing, the attorneys said that
failing to overturn the verdict would ``chill the rights of public
figures to bring defamation suits against powerful media
defendants.''
   Newton attorney Morton Galane said Sept. 20 that he filed the
petition.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that NBC's story falsely implied that
organized crime figures had helped Newton buy the Aladdin Hotel and
Casino in exchange for a hidden interest.
   It awarded Newton $19.3 million, but that was later reduced to
$5.2 million, mostly in punitive damages

   A man who tried to extort $30,000 from a
local anchorwoman to block publication of nude photos that did not
exist was sentenced to five years in prison.
   ``He's a leech,'' KTLA-TV anchorwoman Jann Carl said after
Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor imposed the maximum penalty

   A jury convicted Cabot, 44, of attempted extortion and
conspiracy in connection with the 1988 plot.
   Prosecutors described Cabot as a veteran con artist.
   They said Cabot called Carl and told her a woman planned to sell
nude photos of the anchorwoman to a national magazine. Cabot said
that the photos were taken from a sexually explicit videotape and
that he could block their publication by paying the woman $30,000,
prosecutors said.
   Carl, knowing the video did not exist, went to the police, who
arrested Cabot in a sting operation.

<HEAD>FCC Gives Chicago License to `More Qualified' Applicant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of WSNS-TV in Chicago lost a
lengthy license renewal battle Sept. 19 when the Federal
Communications Commission, in a rare move, said a competing
applicant was more deserving to run the station.
   The commission granted Monroe Communications Corp. a license to
build a new TV station on channel 44. It said Monroe was more
qualified than the current licensee, Video 44, which had switched
the station's format to a subscription movie service.
   Monroe, which began seeking the license in 1982, also claimed
Video 44 had broadcast obscene material, but the FCC did not reach
a decision on that allegation.
   The FCC almost never denies license renewals to incumbents and
already had given Video 44 a renewal in 1989. But the commission
reconsidered the case under orders from a federal appeals court in
Washington.
   Video 44 may appeal the decision to the appeals court.
Otherwise, it must discontinue operations 90 days after the FCC
formally releases its renewal order, which could occur sometime in
the next week or so, FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said.

<HEAD>Jury Indicts 4 in TV Station Pit-Bull Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television reporter was indicted Sept. 20
along with two cameramen on charges they staged pit-bull fights for
a news story and lied about it to a grand jury.
   The Jefferson County grand jury also indicted Guy Walker, the
owner of the dogs, on two counts of dog fighting.
   The three KCNC-TV employees have resigned from the station.
   Reporter Wendy Bergen was indicted on two counts of perjury, one
count conspiracy to commit perjury, three counts of dogfighting,
two counts of promoting a dogfight and one count of hindering
prosecution.
   Cameraman James Stair was charged with one count of perjury, one
count of dogfighting, one count of promoting a dog fight and one
count of hindering prosecution.
   Scott Wright, another cameraman, was indicted on one count of
perjury and one count of hindering prosecution.
   The indictment alleges Bergen and Walker staged dog fights last
September and October. A third dog fight was staged by Bergen and
Stair in March of this year, it claims.
   Dog fighting is illegal in Colorado and is punishable by up to
four years in prison and a $1,000 fine. Conviction on a perjury
charge carries a maximum penalty of eight years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   Prosecutors had investigated allegations Bergen arranged the
fights to show during a so-called ``sweeps'' ratings period, when
competition for viewers is especially high. The four-part series on
pit-bull fighting was broadcast April 30 to May 2 and featured a
fight between two unmuzzled dogs.
   KCNC-TV had said earlier that an anonymous person mailed a
videotape of the fight to the station, but later revised its
statement to say its employees attended the fight, but did not
stage it.
   In a statement Sept. 21, however, the station said certain
segments of the story ``represented as actual dog training sessions
were, in fact, staged re-creations of dog training activities, but
were not identified as such.''
   The station said it was looking into the charges further.

   Channel One delivers 12 minutes a day of topical teen-oriented
stories to classrooms, along with pitches for candy, sneakers and

   The show is produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville,
Tenn., nd seen in 45 states.
   Whittle tested its program in the spring of 1989 and made it
available to schools nationwide starting last March.
   Schools that agree to show the program to all of their students
every day get a loan of videocassette recorders, TV monitors for
every classroom and wiring to tie the system together. They get to
keep the equipment as long as they keep showing the program.

   USA Today founder Al Neuharth has simple advice for publishers
hit by the slumping retail economy: ``Put more news in your
newspapers and charge more for it.'' Neuharth spoke at the
convention of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association in
Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Every public newspaper company could have
avoided or curtailed the current profit slump if management stopped
blaming advertisers and instead prudently priced its products to
the reader. Compared to other small ticket items, any good
newspaper in the USA today should be selling for 50 cents or
more.'' . . . Writer George Plimpton has played a quarterback in
the pros and pitched to major leaguers, but he said his most
frightening experience in ``participatory journalism'' was playing
percussion with the New York Philharmonic. ``In music, you can't
make a mistake,'' Plimpton said. ``In music, if you make a mistake,
you destroy something - you destroy a piece of art.''

   The Bush administration is readying a plan to
provide weapons needed immediately to protect oil-rich Saudi Arabia
and the American soldiers serving there, says Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   The first phase of a two-part package will be sent to Congress
for approval early this week, Baker said Sunday.
   Baker refused to put a price tag on the package, but other
sources said the first installment will total $10 billion, with the
full plan valued at around $21 billion. The second part is expected
to be sent to Congress early next year.
   President Bush agreed to submit the weapons proposal in two
installments after members of Congress, particularly those close to
Israel, objected to the size of the deal. But Baker, appearing on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' insisted Bush was not revising his
plans for the Saudis.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A court decision allowing audio tapes of
counseling to be used in a murder trial has mental health
professionals worried that the ancient tradition of patient
confidentiality is in danger.
   California courts opened the door to the psychotherapist's
office a bit wider with a decision Aug. 6 allowing tapes of
counseling to be used against brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez in
the slaying of their parents.
   Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot repeatedly at close range in
their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. Six months later, police
arrested Lyle, 21, and Erik, 19, alleging the young men coveted
their parents' $15 million estate.
   Prosecutors argued that tapes of the brothers' counseling
sessions with therapist L. Jerome Oziel, in which they reportedly
confessed to killing their parents, could be used as evidence.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht agreed, saying the tapes
were not covered by laws guarding patient-therapist communication.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Japanese admiral who planned the Pearl
Harbor attack got the idea from a British novel, says a new book
examining U.S. and Japanese strategy in World War II.
   Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto - who insisted on the 1941 surprise
raid that destroyed much of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at its base in
Hawaii - based his strategy on a book that had Washington buzzing
when Yamamoto was Japanese naval attache here from 1926 to 1928,
says author William H. Honan.
   The 1925 novel, ``The Great Pacific War'' by Hector C. Bywater,
begins with a surprise Japanese attack in 1931 that wipes out much
of the U.S. Asiatic fleet.
   Honan's book, ``Bywater: The Man Who Invented the Pacific War,''
went on sale earlier this month in England. It is due for U.S.
publication in February with the title ``The Man Who Knew Too Much:
How Hector C. Bywater Invented the Great Pacific War.''

   A new downtown is planned a mile away on a hillside now covered

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Everyone agrees this city is in deep fiscal
trouble. Everyone disagrees on what to do about it.
   Philadelphia faces a $206 million deficit by June 30, the end of

short-term notes to keep the city's bills paid through May.
   On Friday, Mayor W. Wilson Goode announced a hiring freeze and
delays in pension fund payments and tax refunds, freeing up $122
million. But the city still expects to go broke by Dec. 1.
   ``If Philadelphia has even a temporary period without sufficient
cash, the result will be a legal, political and public safety
nightmare,'' Finance Director Betsy C. Reveal said in a recent memo
to Goode.

<DATELINE>KANAZAWA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High in the city's center, surrounded by
waterways that once fed the gardens of feudal lords, the stout
walls of Kanazawa Castle stand ready against attack.
   War, however, hasn't come to Kanazawa in 400 years. Instead,
nearly 6 million tourists annually invade this Hakusan Mountain
city on the Japan Sea that is largely unknown to the West.
   Almost all the modern-day invaders are Japanese nostalgic for a
glimpse of what their country was like before it acquired its
Westernized, concrete-and-glass exterior.
   More recently, though, realty and construction companies have
begun to lay siege to Kanazawa.
   Historic buildings still stand because the city escaped bombing
during World War II. Today, next to the boutiques of nouveau riche
Japan, craftsmen in 100-year-old wood shops fabricate shamisen and
koto, Japanese stringed instruments, and the region's richly
colored Kutani pottery. Samurai houses of yesteryear are still
inhabited.
   In and around Kanazawa, which means ``marsh of gold,'' small
factories produce 98 percent of Japan's gold leaf, pounding tiny
nuggets into feather-light sheets as big as 18-square-foot tatami
mats.
   Those who want to find the old Japan here, however, had better
hurry.
   The inexorable influence of Tokyo, 185 miles southeast, is again
changing Kanazawa's face.
   Ironically, it was pressure from the capital 350 years ago that
prompted Kanazawa's ruling Maeda clan to begin investing heavily in
the traditional arts. As lords of Japan's richest fiefdom, they
wanted to allay fears they were building an army against the
Tokyo-based shogunate.
   Today, Tokyo's giant real estate companies are helping reverse
that centuries-old focus on tradition. Having run out of room in
the Tokyo region, corporations are swiftly developing land in and
around Kanazawa and elsewhere on the main island of Honshu, said
Yoichi Nakanishi, governor of Ishikawa prefecture, which includes
Kanazawa.
   The cramped wooden houses and shops of an earlier era, virtually
worthless except for historical value, are being bulldozed under
and replaced by new structures, he said.
   ``It's a pity, isn't it?'' said the 72-year-old governor.
``Kanazawa is a place where people can live like human beings.''
   Nakanishi says he uses his nose to measure the changes in his
beloved city.
   Too quickly, he laments, the aroma of crowded fish and vegetable
shops is giving way to the smell of fresh concrete. Office
buildings and condominiums in midst of construction are visible
nearly everywhere.
   According to a recent prefectural study, only 7 percent of the
total pre-war homes remain in this city of 450,000 people.
   Kanazawa, however, is working to preserve what's left. Under a
10-year-old government program funded by tourism revenue - which
totaled $240 million in 1989 - the city pays owners of traditional
houses up to 90 percent of the cost of restoring the delicate
lattice-wood exteriors, said Sadao Kunizawa of Kanazawa's tourism
division.
   Even so, negotiations with residents are sometimes difficult.
   ``People like to look at the old houses but they don't like to
live in them. They're inconvenient,'' said Yaeko Ikuno, a housewife
who lives in the city's famed geisha district, where preservation
efforts are focused. ``They would disappear without the
government's help.''
   Many residents nonetheless remain proud of their city's
tradition. Most still finish their houses with Kanazawa's
distinctive black roof tiles, which shimmer in the sunlight.
   Locals point out that Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, went into
decline during the Edo (Tokyo) period, the 250 years of national
isolation that preceded Japan's opening to the West in the mid-19th
century.
   But Kanazawa was born and flourished during that period, when
many of modern Japan's social structures were developed, and
still-popular arts such as Noh theater and tea ceremonies were
refined.
   As a result, residents say, in Kyoto the ``traditional'' part of
the city is set apart as a kind of museum piece. In Kanazawa,
however, the historical culture is still a part of everyday life.
   ``Japanese have a strong attachment to the Edo period,'' said
Sonoko Matsuda, head of the Society to Introduce Kanazawa to the
World, a residents' committee. ``And they can find it in
Kanazawa.''

<TEXT>
   A 15-minute walk from the glass-and-neon glitz of
Tokyo's Ginza district is a tiny enclave of older Japan that is
fighting a losing battle for survival.
   A glimpse of a bygone time can be had on the islands of
Tsukudajima and Tsukishima, which escaped the U.S. bombers that
leveled much of the rest of Tokyo in World War II.
   Traditional wood-frame houses line alleys cluttered by potted
plants guarding every door. Children play in the narrow streets
while older folk chat with old buddies, preserving the slower pace
of life that was the norm before Japan's economic ascent.
   The feel of old Edo, the name of Tokyo during the feudal era,
was captured one August Sunday during a traditional festival that
binds the 300 families of Tsukudajima with the past.
   Hundreds of spectators gathered to cheer Tsukudajima fishermen
as they heaved a gilded shrine onto a barge in Sumida River as part
of a summer festival held every three years since the mid-1600s.
   The barge then circled the island community to bless the
surrounding waters, accompanied by priests and the music of flute
and drums.
   Feverish real estate speculation, however, is threatening to
destroy these remnants of pre-war Tokyo.
   Since 1988, when a 40-story deluxe apartment tower was built
next to Tsukudajima and a subway line was extended to the two
islands, skyrocketing land prices have begun to take a toll.
   Many residents say they have been offered as much as $200,000
for their small homes. Some have sold out, and the two
neighborhoods are now dotted with boarded-up stores and other
property lying unused while speculators wait for land prices to
rise further.
   Shocked by such speculation, urban planners have been trying to
work out a development plan for the islands before it's too late.
   Uzumi Yoshida, head of Chuo ward regional improvement section,
says the city government hopes to preserve the neighborhoods'
traditional role as working-class residential areas.
   But Yoshida acknowledged his authority was limited.
   ``Japan has placed very few restrictions on land ownership. It's
only recently, with land values going through the roof, that the
government has attempted to curb speculation,'' he said.
   Toshie Narusawa, a 52-year-old Tsukishima resident, doubts the
government's sincerity.
   ``City officers are trying to raise the building-to-land ratio.
They told me this: `We want to make the Tsukishima area into New
York's Manhattan,' '' she said.
   Narusawa believes government officials look down on the working
people of Tsukishima and Tsukudajima and are convinced that modern
apartment buildings are preferable to the traditional tiny,
fire-prone homes.
   But, she responds, ``There are many people who are glad to live
in those houses and are proud of it.''
   So far, no citizens' movement has formed to defend the two
districts.
   Instead, since Tokyo entered the modern era, it has destroyed
its past in a constant race to import all that's new to fulfill its
role as Japan's showcase to the world, said Paul Waley, urban
historian and author of ``Tokyo, Now and Then.''
   Narusawa believes the districts' subdivision into small
individual plots and stubborn resistence of some longtime residents
will thwart efforts to turn the islands into high-rise jungles.
   But even if the neighborhoods change, locals say the festival
will continue to provide the glue to hold the community together.
   Every three years, former residents as well as family members
return from all parts of Japan to take part.
   The festival is even helping to weld the newr parts of town to
old Tsukudajima and Tsukishima, says local assemblyman and festival
organizer Yoichiro Fujima.
   ``This was the first year that people from the new apartments
could participate in the festival. So if participating one time
leads to two times, two times lead to three and it continues like
that, the newcomers will help old Tsukudajima retain its culture.''

<HEAD>National Defense Gift Fund: 36-Year-Old `Charity' Suddenly Flush</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Saddam Hussein as the poster boy, the
national defense gift fund is suddenly flush - $20 billion and
counting, for an unlikely charity that used to draw only petty
cash.
   Under prodding from Congress and high-profile administration
solicitors, U.S. allies have agreed to provide at least that much
in mney and services to share the financial burden of the Middle
East crisis.
   The government has been accepting donations for national defense
for 36 years, donations totaling $603,105.33 in all that time. The
gifts went to the Pentagon without much notice because there wasn't
much money involved.
   That changed when the United States sought and got pledges of
allied contributions to help pay for Operation Desert Shield and
other costs of countering the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   At first, the administration figured on using the old system to
handle the new bonanza, so that the donated funds would be funneled
to the Pentagon. It also sought to make that explicit in an
emergency appropriations bill, with a provision to permit use of
donated funds and supplies as the secretary of defense deems
appropriate.
   But Congress quickly spotted the loophole in its authority over
defense spending, and is moving to shut it. An amendment adopted by
the House and a bill proposed in the Senate would require
appropriations by Congress before the Pentagon spends donated
funds, and regular accountings of the use of supplies, services and
other gifts.
   That takes away leeway the Pentagon wanted, but the
administration is not insisting. It would have been no-win anyhow,
and politically costly.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
had warned two weeks ago that if U.S. operations in Desert Shield
were to be ``largely bankrolled by outside contributions'' there
would have to be a way for Congress to supervise the spending.
   He told Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney two weeks ago that the
1954 Defense Gift Act wouldn't suffice because it was set up for
``relatively small donations to the defense effort.''
   For almost 20 years, nobody gave a penny. The first contribution
wasn't made until 1973; the fund got $279 that year. Defense
donations since then have varied widely, often up in times of
stress, down when times are placid.
   Under the 1954 law, money donated for defense goes into the
National Defense Conditional Gift Fund, and is added to the
Pentagon appropriation that comes closest to the intent of the
donor.
   ``The statute certainly never contemplated that such a petty
cash fund would be used to accept donations of billions of dollars
from foreign countries,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
   ``If we learned anything from Iran-Contra, it is that you don't
have these kind of slush funds,'' added Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt.
   At the same time, Congress is keeping up the pressure for other
nations to contribute more toward the cost of defending Saudi
Arabia and punishing Iraq. The administration had opened that drive
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Secretary of the
Treasury Nicholas F. Brady traveling world capitals, seeking
commitments to share the burden.
   In Congress, there were angry protests that other nations
dependent on Persian Gulf oil, particularly Japan and West Germany,
weren't contributing enough to the operation.
   Japan first offered $1 billion, upped to $4 billion in military
and other assistance after a storm of protest that included a House
vote to start withdrawing U.S. forces from Japan unless Tokyo paid
in full for keeping them there. West Germany now has offered $2.1
billion. The rest is coming, in various forms, from other nations
allied in the operation and the sanctions approved by the United
Nations.
   It isn't clear how much of the foreign contribution will
actually pass through U.S. hands anyhow. The Japanese announced
Friday that they were setting up a $900 million ``peace fund'' as
the first installment of their pledge to the Perian Gulf
operation, that it wouldn't be used for weapons, and that they
would administer it in cooperation with the Arab states.
   That doesn't fit the notion that allied checks are in the mail
to Washington. ``Promises are easy, cash is harder,'' Leahy said.
``I want to see the cash.''
   Nor does it fit the idea that foreign fundraising drives may
become a fixture in U.S. diplomacy, ``a new device we'll try to be
using more often in the future,'' as Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger told a House hearing.
   Without Saddam Hussein or his ilk as the villain, vital oil
supplies as an underlying issue, and an atmosphere of urgent crisis
to spur the process, it will be hard to mount a matching quest for
contributions.

<HEAD>`The Simpsons' Sing the Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enough about Michael Jackson. Pay no
attention to those premature reports.
   Yes, the Gloved One has been approached about singing with the
Animated One. But no, it is not a done deal. Which is why the
recent stories about Jackson doing a duet with Bart Simpson have
infuriated the folks over at Fox Broadcasting Co.'s hit cartoon
show.
   Especially perturbed is ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, who
plops down at a West Hollywood recording studio and grants a speedy
interview about the latest project to come from America's favorite
dysfunctional family.
   ``Oh, it's so frustrating,'' says the cartoonist. ``I said to a
reporter a while ago that I would like to have this happen and it
was printed as if it was true.''
   What Groening wished for was Jackson's participation in ``The
Simpsons Sing the Blues,'' an incongruous title for the debut album
of an overnight success story. What Groening is afraid of is that
all the publicity will send the obsessively media-shy Jackson
scurrying from negotiations.
   ``This may kill it,'' Groening says. ``We have a whole wish list
of people we'd like to use on the album. Stevie Ray Vaughan was
lined up, then he was killed.''
   Milling around the recording studio this day are the actors who
provide the voices for ``The Simpsons.''
   There is Julie Kavner, whose scratchy vocals come out of Marge's
animated mouth and Dan Castellaneta, who talks for the
long-suffering dad, Homer. Sitting nearby is Yeardley Smith, the
voice of the high-minded daughter, Lisa. Nancy Cartwright, nursing
a cold and chugging Evian water, drops in and out of Bart's
unmistakable whining monotone.
   The four performers have been working on ``The Simpsons Sings
the Blues'' for about a month. So far, they have completed only two
rough cuts in between taping shows for ``The Simpsons'' fall
season, which begins Oct. 13.
   Due out in November, the disc contains an eclectic mix of old
blues tunes such as Billie Holliday's ``God Bless the Child'' and
original songs such as ``Deep, Deep Trouble,'' produced by rapper
D.J. Jazzy Jeff and written by Groening.
   Fox has been trying to keep the record under wraps until
negotiations with performers like Jackson are nailed down. But word
has leaked out, to the great consternation of those involved.
   Jackson's duet was to come on ``Do the Bartman,'' and published
reports have said it was penned by Jackson. It wasn't, which
prompted producer and filmmaker James L. Brooks to issue a press
release late last week apologizing for any misunderstanding about
who actually wrote the tune. The composer is Jackson pal Bryan
Loren.
   In a marketing blitz highlighted by Simpson T-shirts, Thermoses,
watches, and - coming soon to a video arcade near you - a Simpsons
pinball machine, why are ``The Simpsons'' singing?
   ``James L. Brooks walked into the office one day and said `The
Simpsons Sing the Blues,' '' explains Groening. ``Then we all spent
a lot of time deciding what the blues was.''
   The final decisions for the album include Chuck Berry's ``School
Day,'' sung by Bart; Booker T. Jones' ``Born Under a Bad Sign,''
sung by Homer, and the ``Moanin' Lisa Blues,'' sung by - well, you
know.
   Back at the studio, Fox has organized a media event, pulling in
nearly a half-dozen camera crews to interview and tape the would-be
recording stars in action.
   Problem is, there is no action. The four actors are not laying
down tracks for the album. Instead, much time is spent standing
around while they pretend they're singing for the benefit of the
cameras.
   The phenomenal success of ``The Simpsons'' begets such hype. The
animated family with all-too-common frailties has gone beyond being
a hit television show. It has become part of pop culture.
   This point is not lost on the young Fox network, which made a
brash decision this season to put ``The Simpsons'' up against NBC's
top-rated but aging ``The Cosby Show.''
   Some of ``The Simpsons'' cast think Fox's decision was foolish.
Since moving to Thursdays at 8 p.m., the cartoon show that once
peaked at No. 4 in the Nielsen ratings has plummeted to 45th place.
   ``I think it is a mistake,'' says Kavner. ``It's a sweet little
show. It belongs on Sunday nights.''
   Castellaneta is more upbeat. ``Nobody's happy about it,'' says
the voice of Homer, ``but I don't think it's going to hurt us.''
   Cartwright, sounding nothing like Bart, added, ``It's really
like, if it ain't broke don't fix it. We did fine on Sunday
nights.''
   Says Groening, ``This is a very wild time. We've got a lot of
things going on. There are some very good singers in `The
Simpsons.' This is going to be a big record.''

<HEAD>Traditional Circumcision Rites Endure in Kenya</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MARALAL, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boy, clad in a leather toga, sat on a
cowhide in a circle of male relatives and stared hard at the
stranger's knife.
   The stranger squatted over the boy, made a circular incision
with his knife and seven minutes later Gibson Leisamato, 16, was a
man, a circumcised warrior of the Samburu tribe.
   Unflinchingly, the youngster had endured the delicate operation
without anaesthesia; not until the circumciser had finished did he
make a sound.
   ``Now I want cows!'' Gibson shouted at the end of the ordeal, a
traditional rite of passage for men among most of this East African
nation's 40-odd tribes. Some also circumcise females, but secretly
because of a government ban.
   But medical authorities are concerned about the safety of the
tradition, especially its possible contribution to the spread of
AIDS. Kenya has nearly 10,000 diagnosed cases of the deadly
disease.
   Traditionally, circumcisers use the same knife on any group of
young men at a given location and time. This supposedly creates a
lifelong bond between the initiates.
   ``But the circumciser also uses the same cloth to wipe the
knife,'' says Duncan Mutembei, a male nurse working among the
Samburu. ``Some don't wash between operations.''
   The crude surgery invites infections and every year several
young men bleed to death due to a slip of a knife. Circumcisers
themselves sometimes pay harshly for their mistakes.
   Newspapers in the capital of Nairobi reported the case this year
of a circumciser who was stoned to death by an angry mob after he
cut more than intended from one boy. The youngster lived.
   Joseph Oliech, Kenya's health director, has proposed testing and
licensing of the circumcisers to ensure competence. Most learn
their trade as apprentices.
   For the circumciser, the rite is good business. Relatively few
in number, they perform as many as 50 operations a day, earning as
much as some laborers make in a month. Fees are $5 to $7 an
operation.
   Six hours after his operation and still in sharp pain, Gibson
stoically rejoiced in his new status as a moran, or warrior, of his
northern Kenya tribe.
   ``Now I am a man,'' he said. ``I can have girlfriends. I can get
married.''
   For most tribes, the circumcision right is an annual event. For
the Samburu, it occurs only once every 15 years. But for all, it is
a time of celebration, dance and song.
   Wamba Rashid, an anthropologist at the University of Nairobi,
explains the significance of the event for young men:
   ``It is a way of welcoming them into adulthood. Before then they
were nobodys. It is a way of telling them, `You are no longer a
child. You have rights and responsibilities to the community'.'''
   Some of those responsibilities are long gone.
   Samburu morans no longer defend the tribe. Police do. And they
don't kill lions to prove their bravery. It's against the law.
   But after the ritual, young men can have girlfriends, get
married, own property and participate in other adult activities.
   Whatever his tribe, the initiate must face the surgery bravely,
without a flinch, cry or moan, or shame his family.
   ``I was so worried my son would show fear. I could not eat
before he was circumsiced,'' said Gibson's mother, Najoko.
   After the ritual, sages instruct the initiated in the tribe's
customs, sometimes for up to a month.
   ``The mutilation is talked of most,'' says Rashid. ``But there
is the education and psychological changes that occur.''
   In urban areas, boys are increasingly being circumcised in
hospitals, where health risks are greatly reduced.
   But many feel hospitals are for cowards. So the tradition of
``facing the knife'' endures.
   ``It generates respect among individuals,'' says Samuel
Lekesion, a Samburu and former policeman. ``It also guarantees
survival. If I am in trouble, I can always call upon my age
mates.''

<HEAD>Banks Overextended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has become fashionable to blame real estate
developers for overdoing things, for building too many speculative
projects, for glutting the market with buildings when demand is
headed down.
   As a result, developers are often seen today as impractical
dreamers rather than lionized as imaginative, shrewd, insightful,
gutsy risk-takers, as they were yesterday.
   Yes, they overdid it, as they are prone to do. But the bankers
did, too. The developers couldn't have overbuilt without the money,
and the commercial lenders of America shoveled it at them.
   If the developers went from one extreme to another, the bankers
may have done so even more abruptly. After building their real
estate portfolios they have closed them down, so that good
investments and bad alike are denied.
   A report by the General Accounting Office shows that real estate
portfolios held by commercial banks in 1985 made up 26.6 percent of
their total loans and leases. After rising every year, the
percentage reached 37 percent in 1989.
   It couldn't have happened, of course, if the banks hadn't let it
happen, but the evidence shows clearly that they thought real
estate as an investment was becoming relatively better than
investing in commerce and industry.
   In 1985, about 35 percent of their outstanding loans were in the
commercial-industrial category. That percentage declined every year
through 1989, when it reached 30.1 percent.
   The performance of real estate loans deteriorated as their
percentage of total portfolios rose. In 1988, 2.4 percent of
commercial bank real estate loans were noncurrent; in 1989, it had
risen to 2.9 percent.
   In those figures lies some of the reason for what seems to be a
growing credit crunch that at first involved only small companies,
mostly developers in the Northeast, but which has spread to big and
small companies everywhere.
   What had been the most desired investment, now seems to be the
least desirable. For developers in certain areas to obtain bank
money today would mean dismissal for the loan officer and
conceivably a federal investigation.
   It is not the first instance of extreme behavior by banks. In
the 1970s, for example, they shipped billions of dollars abroad to
less developed nations willing to pay premium rates, while
home-mortgage applications were denied.
   Billions of dollars of those LDC loans, as they are called, are
considered nonperforming now, and commercial banks have been forced
to set aside reserves to cover what some bank analysts believe are
inevitable writeoffs.
   The irony of the current crackdown on loans, provoked mainly by
the too-easy lending policies of a few years ago, is that real
estate developments begun in the next year might be finished when
demand is growing again.
   But neither real estate development nor banking seem to be
gifted with the far-sightedness they claim. Both get excited when
commercial development is at a feverish pace, and they collapse
together when the bad results are in.
   History shows that some of the costliest real estate
developments in America are ready just as the market becomes
glutted, and just before the economy turns down.
   And when the economy is down, and preparing for an upturn a
couple of years hence, neither seems to have the heart or the
foresight to invest.

   LENOX, Mass. (AP) - For Donald Wilkinson, who describes himself
as ``an unbelievable hustler,'' a singing career demands a polished
baritone voice, steel nerves, and a computer.
   It has meant singing with well-known conductors and orchestras,
as well as performing at nursing homes often without pay.
   At 29, Wilkinson is a former electrical engineer who in 1987
quit his $29,000-a-year job with GTE in Needham, Mass., to take a
very vocal chance.
   Now, he's $9,000 in debt, but with a voice as rich as his
promise.
   In Phyllis Curtin's master classes in recent weeks, his voice
has blossomed.
   To release his tense neck muscles one morning, Curtin asked him
to sing the highest note he could reach with his head dangling over
a chair. In another class, she massaged his lips while he was
singing.
   The unusual efforts paid off: Out came a vibrant tone that
boomed into the rough-hewn wooden slabs of the small theater like
rich, controlled thunder.
   ``For me it's a perfect time, all kinds of colors are coming
into my voice,'' he says. What loosened him up, he says, was
thinking of Curtin's idea of ``a tree and roots and blossoming at
the top.''
   At home in Brighton, Mass., a personal computer holds another
secret to his future: files containing information on orchestras,
choral societies, opera companies and festivals for which he can
audition.
   ``Having been an engineer, I'm very organized,'' he says.
``Building a career means constantly going through papers, updating
phone numbers, trying to get out of some secretary what they'll be
doing next year.''
   Meanwhile, Wilkinson, who is single, has had no health insurance
for three years.
   While he was still an engineer, his bosses let him rearrange his
schedule so he could go to auditions and rehearsals. That often
meant working Sundays and evenings, or going to work at 4:30 a.m.
and leaving at 8:30 a.m.
   Now, besides singing with such prestigious groups as Boston's
Handel and Haydn Society, he earns money at funerals and weddings.
And nursing homes, at $40 or less a shot. When elderly people enjoy
his performance, he sometimes sings for free.
   But each year is better financially, he says, and he's inching
up to his engineer's salary.
   ``It's really difficult,'' he says. ``You have to be an
unbelievable hustler, calling people, saying you'll drive five
hours to audition, even if they don't give you a job.''
   But on a recent morning at Tanglewood, Wilkinson, for once,
doesn't have to hustle.
   Relaxed in loose red-and-white striped pants and a T-shirt, he
lavishes his voice on Valentin's aria from Gounod's ``Faust'' - for
Phyllis Curtin.
   The young soldier ``is going off to fight for France and for
glory, and like lots of soldiers, he's probably a farmer boy, he's
going to put a little dirt in his pocket. It's simple, it's
direct,'' she says, mock marching as he sings.
   ``Good, good, good,'' Curtin murmurs.
   ``I'm always magnetized by her teaching,'' Wilkinson says later.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - They call it Sky City, a towering mesa in
western New Mexico that for 800 years has been home to the Acoma
Pueblo Indians, a community of potters. It's a place where little
has changed over the centuries, a place where ancient rituals are
still practiced.

<TEXT>
   An autumn chill now hangs over Sky City, a
sun-hardened citadel of clay and rock that is said to be the oldest
continuously occupied community in the United States.
   On a recent day, hundreds of Indian dancers and potters
displayed their talents as the Acoma Pueblo community observed the
350th annual San Estaban Feast Day, with sprinklings of cornmeal to
bless the Earth.
   Afterward, most Acomas returned to their homes in the valley
below. But a few, mostly potters, are staying on for the windy
winter atop this sandstone stronghold 7,000 feet above sea level.
   ``Up here on top of the mesa there are 12 to 15 families that
live all year long,'' says Camille Pasquale, a potter who helps
guide tourists through the ancient fortress, which survived a
16th-century Spanish invasion.
   Survival cost dearly - 100 men killed, scores enslaved and many
others punished by having their feet severed.
   It's quiet now. The stillness soaks up sound. Voices 10 feet
away vanish like steam. A little boy, following his dog down narrow
lanes, shyly sneaks glances at strangers. Every other doorway
displays pottery.
   Every year the tribe chooses ``field chiefs'' who live here with
their families, each generally representing one of Acoma's 14
clans.
   The Acomas say they have been here more than 1,000 years. They
first settled on neighboring Enchanted Mesa, which was later
abandoned, and then 800 years ago moved to Sky City, a
367-foot-high mesa that was declared a national landmark in 1960.
   Water is still carried in, not piped. No wires bring in phone
calls or electricity. No gas lines here.
   Like the ancient timbers used in the village's 17th-century San
Esteban Mission Church, the firewood for heating and cooking is
hauled here from as far away as Mount Taylor, 40 miles to the
north.
   San Esteban Feast Day, Acoma's big fall celebration, marked the
end of the hot weather and the summer tourist season that brought
in 200 to 300 visitors a day.
   On Sept. 2, a procession carried the carved wooden statue of St.
Stephen from his church on the southwest corner of the mesa to a
shrine on the central plaza. The shrine, as always, was decorated
with cuttings of corn, aspen and wild daisies, flanked by guards
bearing muskets dating back more than a century.
   Inside the shrine, tribal leaders formally accept the Acomas'
offerings of food to the saint.
   Then the white-buffalo dancers, each carrying a multicolored
lightning bolt, begin their celebration, their bells and silver
jewelry jangling. Three men in white skins, skirts and brown
leather leggings and three women in wrapped white buckskin leggings
and floral print shifts, black skirts and white sash vests dance to
the beat of a single drummer.
   Following them, a succession of other troupes enter in turn from
different corners of the square, two by two, each performing in
front of the shrine - the women with large red dots on their
cheekbones, the men with rust-colored swabs, for protection. Fox
pelts dangle from their belts. Fir boughs adorn their sleeves.
   The church dominates the southwest corner of the mesa. The Acoma
women helped Franciscan missionaries complete it from 1629 to 1640,
just as they prepare it every year for the fiesta.
   ``The women and children brought the sand from the valley up in
baskets,'' says Fran Torivio, a Sky City guide and cashier at the
Acoma office below.
   The walled courtyard in front of the church is a cemetery. The
wall is topped with weathered adobe busts of warriors.
   ``These are the soldiers that guard the cemetery,'' Pasquale
says.
   The soldiers are restored annually before the fiesta with new
potsherds for their eyes, and new smiles carved into the clay.
   Acomas would lock themselves in the church when under attack by
Navajos or Apaches, usually around harvest time, Torivio says.
   Tourists still can climb down the ancient stairway carved in the
mesa's northwest face, or they can ride a tour bus.

   Acomas say their ancestors arrived here from Mesa Verde in what
is now southern Colorado. According to legend, they were told by
Iatiku, mother of all Indians, to seek a mesa resembling the tip of
an ear of corn, which symbolizes Iatiku.
   When they saw Enchanted Mesa, they believed they had arrived at
the center of the Earth.
   By various accounts, Enchanted Mesa was abandoned after
earthquakes and-or rainstorms destroyed its ancient staircase,
stranding a few residents on top. Some died jumping or falling,
others starved. Most were already down on the valley floor,
farming. They began anew at Sky City, leaving ruins on Enchanted
Mesa.
   Acomas say they've been at Sky City since about 1200.
   In 1540, Spaniards came looking vainly for gold in the fabled
Seven Cities of Cibola. It is said the golden glint of mica window
panes reflecting the sunset attracted the Spaniards to Acoma.
   ``They thought this was the seven cities of gold, and they could
see shining stuff in the rocks, but it's all sandstone,'' Torivio
says.
   Juan de Onate, Spanish governor of New Mexico, claimed Acoma for
the king. The affable Acomas greeted him warmly in 1598, but
eventually decided to resist.
   When Onate's nephew, Juan de Zaldivar, stopped here shortly
afterward for provisions, he and 12 of his men were massacred.
Zaldivar's brother, Vicente, with a force of 70 men, quickly
avenged their deaths.
   Besides the 100 Acoma men slain, 60 young girls were taken to
Mexico as slaves and the young men and women who remained here also
were kept in servitude. Each adult man had a foot severed.
   In the succeeding century, the Indians sometimes took their
frustrations out on priests, throwing a couple of clerics off the
cliff behind the church. But Acoma has been peaceful since 1690.
   Spanish is not a language the Acomas generally speak, alhough
many have Spanish surnames. They speak Keresan, an ancient Pueblo
tongue, and English.
   Most Acomas today live in villages such as Acomita and McCartys
in the 30 miles between Sky City and Interstate 40, about 50 miles
west of Albuquerque.
   ``Our total population is about 4,000 people, but they live in
other villages because our other villages have electricity and
running water,'' Torivio says. ``That's where we have all the
modern homes. That's where we have the TV, the shower and the
microwave.''
   In the old days, Acoma potters got their clay from the mountains
and mixed in ground-up shards from old pots. They made their pots
by hand and fired them in wood-fueled adobe kilns.
   Though many potters today use ready-made ware fired in electric
kilns, the designs are still authentic Acoma. Acoma is known for
its fine-line designs, painted with yucca-stem brushes.
   The yucca stem is chewed so that a few fibers form a primitive
brush. The fewer the fibers, the finer the brush line. The thin,
repetitive lines represent rain - until recently Acoma's only
source of water, collected in natural rock cisterns around the
mesa.
   During the peak tourism periods of summer, 20 to 30 potters sell
their wares here, including Sky City's oldest resident, Concepcion
Faustine, who is at least 80 years old.
   ``I've been here since 1909,'' she says in halting English.
Mostly, she speaks Keresan. This day, she is selling Indian fry
bread and small handmade pots painted with brown and black designs.
   Potters still pray to Clay Woman before starting a pot.
   Jackie Torivio, no relation to Fran Torivio, majored in business
administration at the College of Santa Fe and now she and husband
Mike run the family pottery-making business.
   ``He makes the pots for me, and I do the design,'' she says.
   But being a field chief, a clan representative chosen to live
for a year at Sky City, has cut into Mike's pottery making, she
says.
   Jackie and Mike Torivio have a house in McCartys.
   ``I go down weekly to check my answering machine and get the
mail and do laundry, all the things that we don't have up here,''
she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - After decades of exclusion, Western scholars
recently were allowed to travel China's fabled Silk Road in search
of archaeological treasures. But it was look, don't touch. The
Chinese are resentful of Westerners hauling off vestiges of their
heritage.

<TEXT>
   More than 4,000 years after East met West
in the swirling sands of China's western deserts, modern
treasure-seekers are unlocking clues to the past along the ancient
Silk Road.
   Isolated by location and for political and military reasons,
most of the Silk Road for decades has been closed to foreign
scholars.
   The government has jealously guarded its riches, resentful of
Western archaeologists who removed thousands of priceless documents
and works of art from the region in the late 19th and early 20th
century.
   However, a recent month-long desert expedition sponsored by the
United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization gave
about 80 foreign and Chinese scholars and journalists a rare
opportunity to travel the Silk Road and to discuss ways to preserve
its ancient heritage.
   Marco Polo, Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great followed the
Silk Road.
   Camel caravans braved the harsh desert to bring China's silk,
roses and paper to the West. They carried color-glazing techniques,
jade and cotton north and eastward into China.
   The desolate Taklamakan desert was originally inhabited by
nomads and traders who built cities and bazaars in oases clinging
tenuously to life in the desert sand.
   Historians, who are still unearthing, cataloging and
interpreting archaeological evidence from the region, say the first
Chinese conquest of the region was in the early Han Dynasty, about
200 to 300 B.C.
   Despite its desolation, the Silk Road and the surrounding desert
is a strategic crossroads between Africa, Europe and Asia. Mongols,
Chinese, Tibetans and Moslem Uyghurs have fought over this
strategic territory nestled between Tibet, Mongolia, Persia, India
and China.
   Today the region is still rocked by periodic Moslem rebellions.
An anti-Chinese riot this spring almost led to the cancellation of
the expedition, participants said.
   After several postponements, the expedition began on July 20 in
Xi'an, the easternmost end of the Silk Road, some 150 miles from
the Great Wall that traditionally marked the edge of Chinese
civilization.
   After the expedition ended Aug. 18 in the western bazaar city of
Kashgar, scholars and journalists gathered in Urumqi, capital of
China's westernmost Xinjiang Autonomous Region, to review and share
their findings.
   Foreign scholars traveling with the group said China's decision
to go ahead with the expedition apparently was intended to
demonstrate its willingness to continue opening up to the outside
world, despite political repression following the crushing of
student-led democracy movements in June 1989.
   ``I think the opening to the outside world economically has
finally begun to enter the intellectual sphere,'' said Richard B.
Stamps, professor of anthropology and Chinese studies at Oakland
University in Rochester, Mich.
   Stamps said discussion of possible joint research projects could
eventually lead to the lifting of a ban on foreign participation in
Chinese archaeological digs.
   ``The expedition was very useful for the foreign scholars, like
myself, who have wanted all their lives to come work in China. Now
we have name cards and contact people who have long worked in
isolation,'' Stamps said.
   Isenbike Aricanli Togan, professor of Inner Asian history at
Washington University, said, ``I have been working on the history
of Xinjiang for over 20 years and this was the first time I could
actually see it. You can imagine how excited I was.''
   The exchange yielded some surprises. Caucasian human remains
from tombs more than 3,000 years old near Hami indicated a link
between Asia and Europe that may explain why some languages, such
as Tibetan, are Indo-European, said Ahmad Hasan Dani, director of
the Pakistan Center for the Study of the Civilization of Central
Asia.

   Many of the scholars identified symbols and architecture proving
ancient cultural influences from Persia and India in China.
   But scholars and journalists who traveled the entire 6,125 miles
of the Silk Road and its byways by car, truck, camel and donkey
cart said they were frustrated by limits imposed as they viewed
long-awaited murals and sculptures.
   ``The Chinese are very protective and jealous of their
copyrights,'' said one participant who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said in some cases they were charging as much as $100 for
photos and in many other cases they refused to allow photographs or
sketching at all. Many scholars were forced to rely only on their
memories of what they saw, he said.
   Chinese leaders of the expedition say the limits were based on
concerns about damage to the exhibits and on time constraints.
   ``Our task was not to excavate or discover archaeological
sites,'' said Xu Pingfang, director of the Institute of History at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``Many of these things have
never been seen by foreigners before and the museums have never
been opened before.''
   Stamps said the constraints also were based on an international
tradition that maintains that the finder of an archaeological
discovery should be the first to publish the findings.
   ``The Chinese are struggling to get the massive volume of
artifacts found in the past decade into libraries,'' he said.
``Only some have been published.''
   The expedition raised delicate questions about the ownership and
preservation of ancient artifacts.
   Many artifacts taken from the Silk Road's magnificent tombs,
temples and grottoes now sit in European and Western museums. They
form the basis of Central Asian research in the West.
   A call by Chinese journalist Li Xiguang for the return of those
treasures to China prompted some Western scholars to suggest that
some items, or at least their reproductions, should be returned to
their places of origin.
   Others argued, however, that the wealth of the Silk Road belongs
to all mankind and that an international effort, such as that
initiated by the Getty Foundation for the Buddhist grottoes at
Dunhuang, is needed to prevent its destruction.
   Dunhuang's nearly 500 caves have been called a ``1,600-year-old
art gallery of Buddhist culture.'' But its thousands of magnificent
frescoes and statues are threatened by pollution and other changes
in the environment caused partly by thousands of visitors each
year.
   Members of the expedition spoke of Buddhist sculptures kept in
unroofed, earthen museums that were literally disintegrating
because local curators lacked the funds and technology to preserve
them.
   ``Unfortunately, archaeologists in China sometimes lack the
sophisticated controls that we maintain in the West. They have the
funds to dig, but not to curate their findings,'' said one scholar
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The fact that we have those pieces in France has raised some
questions about conservation,'' said Jacques Gies, curator at the
Guimet Museum in Paris.
   Gies said researchers in France recently have developed ways to
extract destructive salts that ruin crude earth sculptures, without
destroying their color or quality.
   ``We are working very hard to transmit and to preserve the
heritage we have inherited,'' said Christa Paula, a researcher at
the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies,
which also has many documents and artifacts taken from sites along
the Silk Road.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Many alcoholics shy away from Alcoholics
Anonymous because of its religious overtones, and now there are
groups that offer a psychological alternative. While they are
growing, they walk a thin financial line.

   For some alcoholics who cannot abide the idea of
praying for relief from their addiction, there are alternatives.
Some are spinoffs from Alcoholics Anonymous and some are within AA
itself.
   Many members of Alcoholics Anonymous say they need some sort of
spiritual awareness, but Bill Talley, an atheist and a recovering
alcoholic, is one of a growing number of former drinkers who have
found an alternative to spiritual treatment for their illness.
   In some of the more sophisticated major cities such as New York,
one AA member says, the organization is aware of the religious
problem and has sanctioned groups which look for professional help.
It also tries to accommodate such diverse groups as lesbians, gays
and the deaf, all of whom require adjustments in traditional AA
procedures.
   Talley was a pioneer in establishing support groups for
alcoholics who are uncomfortable with AA's spiritual path to
sobriety.
   ``I'd been to many meetings for a couple of years, until I
finally went out of there screaming,'' Talley recalls.
   So Talley, with the help of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and
her network, started his own alcoholic recovery group and called it
AAARG, American Atheist Addiction Recovery Groups.
   He later changed the name of his organization to Methods of
Moderation and Abstinence (MOMA) because some people ``had trouble
with the `A' (atheist) word,'' he says.
   Talley, who has a Denver free-lance advertising consulting
business, has used his own money to keep his organization going.
Its growth has been slow but steady. But Talley says his business
``is dying'' because of the stigma of being an atheist. ``I'm
running out of money. It's been a struggle.''
   In succeeding years other groups have been organized, including
``Secular Organization for Sobriety,'' or SOS, started by James
Christopher in California, and Rational Recovery (RR), started by
Jack Trimpey, also in California.
   The most recent, and possibly the best-organized, is the
International Association of Secular Recovery Organizations,
founded by Stanley Endick at Lauderdale by the Sea, Fla.
   They have far fewer members than AA, which reports several
million worldwide, but they are growing. Talley estimates about
15,000 or more people are tied to MOMA and that SOS and RR are
approaching that number. Talley says MOMA is now in 89 major
cities, every state and seven countries.
   Talley's argument against AA goes beyond religion.
   ``In AA, they say, `If you think you are an alcoholic, then you
are'. But maybe you're not. Maybe you're just a drinker.''
   ``In our groups, you're encouraged not only to diagnose yourself
sensibly, based on modern psychological principles, but also to see
a professional,'' he says. ``See what he thinks.''
   But Talley concedes that AA works for many. ``Even though I
don't accept their premise that this is a progressive terminal
disease for everyone,'' he says, ``I accept the premise that it's
going to be terminal for some.''
   Talley quotes studies that show a few people can learn to
moderate their use of alcohol.
   Besides IASRO, which is aimed at uniting the alternative groups,
Endiuck, also heads the Steven Danzinger Foundation, a 15-bed
inpatient program.
   The foundation is supported by the mother of Steven Danzinger, a
36-year-old addict who overdosed 2{ years ago after dropping out of
AA.
   ``He wan't an atheist or agnostic,'' Endick says. ``He was
Jewish. He consistently objected to his mother about the overtly
Christian overtones. His mother thought maybe if he had had an
alternative, he may have recovered.''
   Trimpey, a crisis intervention counselor who had alcohol
problems of his own before establishing Rational Recovery, says,
``We're trying to protect people from further exposure to (AA's)
doctrine of submissiveness and powerlessness, which is very
damaging to mental health.''
   Trimpy's group differs from other groups by encouraging the
recovering alcoholic to leave the group eventually.
   ``There's more to life than the constant fight to stay sober,''
he says.
   AA offers 12 steps to recovery from alcoholism, including an
admission that ``we were powerless over alcohol...that a Power
greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.''
   An AA member in Denver, who identified himself as Gary K., said
the ``Power'' needn't be a theistic god.
   ``The Big Book (AA's 575-page bible) says, `God, as you
understand him,' and each individual is free to find his or her own
conception. That's what separates AA from religion.
   ``Many use the group itself as the Power. Many will seek the God
of religion. Each individual is left to his or her own devices.''
   The alternative groups use some of the same methods. But one of
MOMA's positions is that people can learn ``to use virtually all
psychoactive substances with moderation.'' Abstinence, however, is
preferred.
   The alternative groups have variations of AA's 12 steps. One of
MOMA's ``Ten Criteria'' calls for a member to ``assume
responsibility for one's own life, though at times choosing to seek
the help of others.'' Another calls on members to ``be objective,
rational and scientific, and to apply the laws of logic and
scientific method in daily living.''
   One of the 11 tenets of Rational Recovery states: ``The idea
that I need something greater than myself upon which to rely is
only another dependency idea, and dependency is my original
problem.''
   AA has ``no opinion'' on alternative alcohol programs, said Gary
K. ``We try to be as inclusive as we can be...As far as the
alternative things, we do not endorse anything. But great. If it
works, tell us about it. Our interest is solely recovery from
alcoholism.''
   AA, which is self-supporting through contributions, doesn't
allow any one person to contribute more than $1,000 a year, Gary K.
says.
   Talley doesn't have that problem.
   ``Out of all the mail I've got this week, this is the only
contribution,'' he says, holding up half a dozen postage stamps.
``But I'm grateful for that.''
   He thinks eventually the alternative organizations will grow
sufficiently to mount fund-raising efforts and maybe pay a salary.
   ``I'd love to have a full-time staff cranking out literature,
handling inquiries, writing articles, cross-pollinating with the
other organizations,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - What's in a name? Plenty, if you're in the hotel
or motel business. Small, independent hostelries are fast
disappearing, unable to compete with the big franchised operations.
For one thing, people in the industry say, travelers don't like
surprises.

   Funerals help keep the Henry Clay Hotel
alive.
   That's how bad business is at the 14-room hotel that Alma
Jarrett's parents bought in their hometown 25 years ago.
   Most of the Henry Clay's guests aren't staying for pleasure.
Some of them are motorists who just got lost.
   ``Usually the people who come in here are coming to do some kind
of job, or they're here for a funeral,'' Mrs. Jarrett says.
   The story is the same at thousands of small, independent hotels
and motels across the land. They are being choked out by the big
franchised operations.
   ``The mom-and-pops are dying,'' says Frank Torres, franchise
coordinator of Econo Lodges of America, based in Charlotte, N.C.
``You have a lot of independents that are feeling the pressure. It
might be a good-looking property, but the travelers are just not
using them. They're finding they just need to tie in with
someone.''
   Travelers are reluctant to stay in motels they know little
about, says June Farrell, public relations director for the
Marriott Corp. of Bethesda, Md.
   ``When you're traveling, you don't want any surprises,'' she
says. ``The last thing you want to worry about is whether that room
will be clean, will the bed be lumpy. You don't know what you're
getting when you're not with a major chain.''
   Mike Mulvaney, analyst for Moody's Investors Service in New
York, says there are still a lot of independents to be found. ``But
there's a greater potential for success if you're part of a
chain,'' he says.
   Mulvaney says the roadside hotel-motel industry boomed in the
early 1980s because of tax incentives that allowed investors to use
the costs in building and opening a new motel as a shelter for
capital gains in other investments.
   ``The whole boom in construction has yet to be absorbed by the
industry,'' he says. ``They were building these properties not
because they needed a hotel at that specific location, but for the
tax write-offs they would gain.''
   The restructuring of tax laws in 1988 put an end to the motel
building craze, he says.
   Besides the competition from national chains, many independents
such as the Henry Clay suffer from their location far off the
interstate highway.
   To reach the Henry Clay, about 50 miles east of Charleston,
guests must leave Interstate 79 and drive about 15 miles on three
different state highways. The Henry Clay is not advertised outside
of the Clay County telephone book and in a state directory.
   It's also no vacation running the place.
   ``We stay here seven days a week, 24 hours a day,'' Mrs. Jarrett
says. ``It's been four years since I had a vacation.''
   Another woman helps out in the adjacent restaurant when things
are hectic and Arthur Jarrett, Alma Jarrett's husband, works for
extra money at a nearby garage.
   The motel's country-style restaurant is open from about 5:30
a.m. until about 9 p.m.
   ``The restaurant can't make it without the hotel and the hotel
can't make it without the restaurant,'' Mrs. Jarrett says.
   The noon hour is crowded at the restaurant and regulars often
come by for a hot dog or some conversation throughout the day.
   ``You know how many hot dogs you have to sell to pay a $1,000
electric bill?'' Mrs. Jarrett asks.
   Things were better in the '70s when coal was more profitable and
the nearby mines were busier.
   ``We'd change the beds and let a mining crew sleep, then we'd
change the beds again and let another crew in,'' she says.
   Guests pay only $10 a night for a single or $15 a night for a
double. But credit cards are not accepted because Mrs. Jarrett says
she can't afford the credit card fee.
   At the Henry Clay, there's no money for advertising or for
toll-free reservations numbers to help draw customers from other
areas and to help compete with the franchised motels.
   ``The changing face of marketing is making it difficult for the
average mom-and-pop to compete in the marketplace today,'' says Ms.
Farrell of Marriott. ``Unless you have a major national name, you
have a very, very hard time being an independent hotel operator.''
   But the small motel is not going to disappear from the roadside,
Ms. Farrell says.
   ``There's always a traveler somewhere in the market who likes
the small, the one-of-a-kind,'' she says. ``I think the mom-and-pop
operator is going to have to be a lot more clever about his
product.
   ``They may have to affiliate with a chain in some fashion.
They're going to have to forget about the old ways of doing
business. They just may have to compete differently.''
   When some mom-and-pop motels can't beat the chains, they join
them.
   George Crompton and his wife, Margaret, are new Econo Lodge
franchise owners in Sturbridge, Mass., after 18 years as
independents.
   ``It was becoming a problem because everyone else my size in
town had become members of one chain or another.''
   Downtown motels sometimes referred guests to the Cromptons'
motel when they were filled up, he says, but that was happening
less often.
   Crompton moved to the Boston area in 1968 from Liverpool,
England, to work as a mechanical engineer, but quit after six years
to move to the countryside about 60 miles west of Boston. They
built the hotel from 11 rooms in 1972 to 48 rooms today.
   Crompton said it was too soon to know whether the Econo Lodge
name was going improve business.
   Joining a chain costs big money. Torres says an Econo Lodge
franchise costs $20,000.
   The money gives motel owners the right to use the Econo Lodge
name and buys the services of corporate advisors who help the
owners with training and orientation.
   A new Econo Lodge motel also pays 6.5 percent of gross room
receipts as a royalty to the corporation and for marketing, Torres
says. The corporation then provides national advertising,
billboards and a toll-free reservations number.
   There are about 600 Econo Lodge franchises operating now and
about 100 more motels are under contract, Torres says.
   Motel owners wanting to buy the chain's name must meet certain
standards.
   Torres says they should be a two-story building with 50 or more
rooms. Rooms must average 12 feet by 24 feet and at least 75
percent of the rooms must have a shower and tub combination instead
of just showers.
   Motels with less than 20 rooms cannot qualify even for the
lowest-budget franchises such as Friendship Inn, which is owned by
Econo Lodges, Torres says.

   This time novelist Jackie Collins can't whine
about the way some screenwriter handled her work.
   Collins wrote her own screenplay for the three-part drama
``Jackie Collins' `Lucky-Chances','' scheduled for Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday on NBC. It's taken from two books that follow the lives
of Gino Santangelo and his daughter, Lucky.
   ``I wanted to get involved because I hate writers who whine
about how their work's treated,'' said Collins, who recalls an
unhappy experience when her novel ``Hollywood Wives'' was given to
other writers for a miniseries in 1985.
   This time she was not going to stand by and see another writer
adapt her two novels for the 6-hour miniseries based on ``Lucky''
and ``Chances.''
   ``I'm pleased, and I think I captured its humor and vitality,''
she says. ``I can't whine to anybody, because I did it.
   ``This is more fun than `Hollywood Wives.' That miniseries was
not like the book at all. `Hollywood Wives' had 12 major stars, all
playing the wrong roles. They had Angie Dickinson as the agent. To
cast her as a woman who couldn't get a date was ridiculous.''
   Collins says that for ``Lucky-Chances'' she had an equal hand in
casting with executive producer Susan Baerwald and director Buzz
Kulik.
   Vincent Irizarry stars as Gino, a tough street kid who builds an
empire that includes Las Vegas casinos. Nicollette Sheridan stars
as Lucky, who threatens to take it all away from him.
   The glitzy miniseries, awash with passion and intrigue in the
sun-drenched haunts of the rich and powerful, also stars Anne-Marie
Johnson, Michael Nader, Eric Braeden, Stephanie Beacham, Mary
Frann, Leann Hunley, David McCallum, Sandra Bullock, Phil Morris,
Harold P. Pruett, Audrey Landers, Tim Ryan, Luca Bercovici and
Shawnee Smith.
   Collins' latest book, ``Lady Boss,'' in which Lucky Santangelo
takes over the last privately owned movie studio, is also
attracting attention as a possible miniseries on NBC.
   Collins has spent the last 20 years writing about sex, love,
beautiful people and exotic locations. She writes from the inside.
She is the sister of television vamp Joan Collins, who recently
wrote her own best seller.
   Jackie Collins' husband, Oscar Lerman, is owner of the Tramp
Club in London. ``That's where I got all the wonderful gossip for
`Rock Star,' my last book before `Lady Boss,''' she says.
   As for her sister, she says, ``Joan lives in France and I only
see her when I get to Europe. We're the best of friends, contrary
to popular belief.''
   Despite an abundance of sex in her books, Collins contends
that's not what makes them best sellers.
   ``They're not successful because they're lusty,'' she says.
``Sex alone doesn't sell, believe me. I think they're successful
because of the humor. They're a great send-up. People do read them
for other reasons, but my true fans read them for the humor. They
also love a good story, good relationships and good characters.''
   Collins says she still writes the old-fashioned way. ``I write
with a pen in a book,'' she says. ``I write 10 to 12 pages a day.
My secretary puts them on the word processor and I make the
changes.''
   She contends that ``Lucky-Chances,'' which begins in the 1930s,
is based on reality.
   ``You're not getting the front pages of the tabloids,'' she
says. ``You're getting the truth, but I'm protecting the innocent.
It's an American drama of a street kid who rises to fame. He looks
around to see who the heroes of the day are, and they're gangsters.
He becomes a gangster with a heart of gold and he has a daughter
who becomes his rival.''
   The books have all the ingredients of the genre: the prostitute
who becomes a society lady, the son from the secret liaison, the
Greek shipping magnate, and the woman who marries for money and
gets it all when her husband suddenly dies.
   The miniseries will be up against the American and National
League baseball playoff games on CBS. The games Sunday and Tuesday
will be played in prime time on the East Coast.
   ``Am I nervous being up against the playoffs?'' she says.
``Who's going to watch baseball when you can have Nicollette
Sheridan?''
   Collins, who has published 13 books, including several best
sellers, says she began writing at the age of 8.
   ``I made up stories,'' she says. ``It's like when you were
around the campfire and told stories. I was thrown out of school a
15 for waving to the resident flasher. And I smoked in my school
uniform and was truant a lot. I had a lot of adventures. You have
to have adventures to be able to write. I was a wild child and when
I started to write in my 20s, I knew plenty.
   ``I find it interesting that so many people try to copy my work.
They think if you're a woman and good-looking you can write. They
don't realize the amount of work that goes into it.''

   Timberlake Wertenbaker's new play, ``Our
Country's Good,'' is taking the regional theater circuit by storm.
   The drama celebrates a real-life event, the first theatrical
performance in Australia. That was in 1789 when a group of English
convicts staged George Farquhar's early 18th-century comedy, ``The
Recruiting Officer.''
   Does that sound unpromising and esoteric? Not to the London
critics who cheered when ``Our Country's Good'' premiered at the
Royal Court Theater in 1988 and later won the Olivier Award for
play of the year. And not to artistic directors on the regional
theater circuit in the United States and in Canada. They have made
it one of the most-produced new plays of this season.
   ``Our Country's Good'' had its American premiere last fall at
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and then in April it was done
at the Remains Theater in Chicago. The Repertory Theater in St.
Louis has just finished a production, while Hartford Stage in
Connecticut has a version directed by Mark Lamos now running.
   Other productions are planned for the New American Theater in
Rockford, Ill.; the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Portland;
California's Berkeley Repertory Theater and A Contemporary Theater
in Seattle. In Canada, there will be productions in Edmonton,
Montreal and Halifax this season.
   ``The play has wonderful insights into the ideas of making
theater and that's always interesting to people like me,'' says
Lamos, artistic director at Hartford Stage, where the play is on
view through Nov. 3. ``On a larger level, it's about the power of
education. How education can transform people's lives.''
   ``Our Country's Good'' originally was inspired by ``The
Playmaker,'' a novel by Australian writer Thomas Keneally.
   ``It would be unfair to the novel to say that the play is an
adaptation,'' Wertenbaker said in a telephone interview from a New
Hampshire vacation retreat. ``There are characters that don't
appear in the novel, and the plot is slightly changed.''
   The Keneally book was brought to her in London by Max
Stafford-Clark who runs the Royal Court, that shrine of modern
British drama which first gave the world such classics as John
Osborne's ``Look Back in Anger.''
   ``I said I wouldn't adapt `The Playmaker' but I would be very
interested in doing something on the same subject,'' the playwright
recalled.
   Wertenbaker used the novel as well as ``The Fatal Shore,'' a
history of an Australian penal colony by Robert Hughes, as the
taking-off points for her play. She also did a lot of research at
the British Museum into the journals of the real-life main
character, an idealistic lieutenant who directed the convicts in
the Farquhar comedy.
   Wertenbaker and the actors who eventually were cast in the play
at the Royal Court also interviewed former prisoners who were
involved in theater.
   ``What interested me was the notion of the redemptive power of
theater which is in the novel and I suppose was something I
believed in anyway,'' the playwright said. ``We would ask them
about what theater had meant to them. They had found a great deal
of freedom by being involved in theater during their prison
sentences.''
   ``Our Country's Good'' is a big play - 22 characters and 22
scenes.
   ``I wanted to follow quite a lot of characters,'' Wertenbaker
said. ``And that's always difficult to construct, to keep the
characters straight and to keep their stories going throughout the
play.''
   Wertenbaker wrote the play under deadline pressure. It already
had been scheduled to open and run in repertory with a revival of
``The Recruiting Officer,'' with the same actors appearing in both
plays.
   ``So we had to work very fast in rehearsals,'' she recalled. ``I
was getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning to rewrite and I would
bring in a scene which they would then rehearse that morning. It
was quite something.''
   Wertenbaker went to Connecticut briefly in mid-September to
attend rehearsals of ``Our Country's Good'' at Hartford Stage and
to answer any questions the American actors might have about her
play.
   Wertenbaker did encourage the American actors not to use strong,
18th-century accents.
   ``We don't really known what 18th-century accents were like
anyway,'' she said. ``The play is not written in a lot of local
dialects. I'm a modern playwright. I've just given some rhythms to
certain characters. Actors should just use their natural voices and
accents and then push it a little bit.''
   Wertenbaker is more guarded about her private life than she is
about her public writing.
   The playwright has described herself as an
``Anglo-French-American'' who lives in north London, grew up in the
south of France and went to school in the United States.
   Wertenbaker had her first play produced in 1983. Since 1984, she
has been a resident writer at the Royal Court, earning recognition
there with a play called ``The Grace of Mary Traverse.'' She has
also had works done by the Royal Shakespeare Company.
   Right now, she's laboring on a new play commissioned by the
Royal Court. No details were revealed but she did say her deadline
is December.
   ``I sit down every day,'' she said. ``I have a little study in
the back of my house that looks out over a garden. I have privacy.
   ``I take very precise notes - the scene, who's in the scene,
what they are doing in the scene. I do that in longhand. Then I
write on a word processor. But I don't write dialogue until the
last minute. Not until everything else is sorted out in the
scene.''

   In an open field in the center of Berlin, a
low mound of debris over Adolf Hitler's ``Fuehrer bunker'' rises
near traces of the Berlin wall - the rubble of Germany's bitter
past.
   Neither is a monument. No bronze plaques instruct visitors how
to think about the mingled symbols of the fascist German Reich and
the Cold War division of Europe.
   Yet, the questions they pose about the future are now rising as
the lens of history tries to keep pace with the leap to unity of
East and West Germany on Oct. 3, recreating a country of almost 80
million people, by far the largest in Europe.
   The new Germany, like it or not, will have to prove again and
again that it is different, because in being big, rich and
powerful, it will look somewhat like the bad old Germany.
   A half-century ago, German militarism - already carrying a long
history of making trouble for Germany's neighbors - forced
Blitzkrieg on Europe. Invasion, the bombing of cities, occupation,
captive people and Holocaust death camps to exterminate Jews all
sprang from Germany.
   World War II is ``useful to remember,'' said Nicholas Ridley a
few months ago in the interview that led to his resignation as
Britain's trade and industry secretary.
   Germans today are ``uppity,'' Ridley said, they are taking over
Europe by economic power, and he thought a lot of people in Europe
agreed with him.
   Ridley exited the political stage and the fuss was only a ripple
in the headlong rush to unify Germany. Yet it served as a reminder
of the resentment Germany has earned repeatedly since Bismark
united the Germans under the Prussian flag in 1871.
   There's ample evidence that Germany is conscious of a need to
work off the evil legacies of the past.
   West Germany has paid $52 billion to the state of Israel and to
survivors of the Holocaust. There are numerous public monuments to
the victims of Naziism and memorials at death-camp sites.
   Still, some Germans are tired of thinking about it.
   Germans ``want to be glad. They don't want to walk around
stressed, confronted from morning till evening with the burden of
history,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl told British journalist David
Marsh of the Financial Times.
   West German author Patrick Sueskind wrote in the weekly Der
Spiegel of his confusion on seeing Kohl raise a toast ``Auf
Deutschland'' - ``To Germany'' after negotiations in Moscow.
   Sueskind hadn't ever heard anyone toast Germany, and what sprang
to his mind was Auschwitz and the war.
   ``But that's not what the chancellor meant,'' Sueskind wrote.
``He didn't have the old, aggressive Germany in mind, but rather
the present and future Germany, peaceful, civilized, bound up into
Europe.''
   Will the united Germany be up to the political standards of the
emerging new world order? The 61 million West Germans have had 45
years experience in democracy, but the 16.6 million East Germans
languished since the war under a Communist police state. Many
collaborated, most were passive, few resisted. They weren't told
much about the Holocaust.
   ``We had to have a crash course in democracy,'' says Tino
Schwierzina, who became mayor of East Berlin last spring as East
Germany held its first free elections. ``I think we've done a good
job.''
   Yet East German political life has been about as chaotic as the
East German economy since the peaceful revolution in the fall of
1989. Twelve of 22 cabinet members have quit or been fired, due to
incompetence, political strife or because of alleged ties to the
once-dreaded Stasi secret police organization.
   The poison in the Stasi's 6 million files will still haunt the
country after unification.
   How hard should the police seek out those who committed crimes
under orders from East Germany's Communist bosses?
   Can murder prosecutions be brought against those who killed
approximately 200 people trying to cross the East German-West
German border, including the Berlin Wall in the 28 years it stood
before last Nov. 9?
   Such issues are only a few of many facing the Germans after they
vote on whether to stay with Kohl's center-right government, or go
for Oskar Lafontaine's leftist Social Democrats.
   Other big domestic issues:
   -Rebuilding substandard industry and infrastructure in the East,
and other costs of unification, may require the government and
private sector to invest an estimated $775 billion over five years,
says Elmar Pieroth, an economics expert from Kohl's party, the
Christian Democratic Union.
   -Social subsidies will be crucial to retain the good will of
East Germans, said Gerhard Behrendt, an undersecretary in the East
German environment ministry. Like many, Behrendt doesn't know if he
will have a job after unification.
   ``It was common to have two workers in a family, and you got
only an average living standard,'' he said. ``If production
decreases now and jobs disappear, someone must still earn money,
but how?''
   -The East Germans may have 2 million unemployed soon as one
enterprise after another collapses. West Germany is a luxury-loving
land where incomes are more than double the $765 a month reported
in East Germany's official but dubious statistics.
   West Germans are cruising through East Germany in their BMWs
looking to reclaim family properties confiscated decades ago by the
Communists. The prospect of wealthy West Germans ousting jobless
Easterners from low-rent housing highlights the trouble looming for
the next government over the disparity between East and West German
living standards.
   -Money, indeed, will be an issue. West Germany is rich, but can
it afford all that reconstruction money? And $9.5 billion to Moscow
to finance the withdrawal of 370,000 Soviet troops from East
Germany? And $3 billion for the Persian Gulf crisis?
   -A flood of refugees is testing how different today's Germany is
from the fascist one that created a flood of refugees leaving
Germany. A stream of Soviet Jews applying to come to Germany is of
great historical irony; perhaps true to historical form, the Bonn
government has temporarily halted processing of applications from
Jews citing an apparently unmanageable wave, with 10,000 applicants
in Kiev alone.
   This year West Germany expects a record 120,000 asylum
applicants, and 50 percent more next year.
   The refugees and ``guest workers'' from Turkey and southern
Europe have changed the face of Germany. Especially in the cities,
Germany today is a cosmopolitan mixture of Turks, Yugoslavs, blacks
and Asians with their own bakeries, restaurants and, for the Turks,
a TV channel in their language.
   -East Germany's environment, in worse shape than the West's, was
poisoned by industries that were competitive only because they
burned cheap, foul brown coal and dumped untreated wastes into
rivers. The clean-up bill will be enormous.
   One of the hottest topics in Berlin can be identified as
``Berlin as the future European metropolis.''
   Now a city of 3 million, spacious Berlin will become the German
capital - Bonn was always West Germany's ``interim'' capital.
   Berlin is where the heart of the new Germany beats strongest,
where unity came in the heady rush of a popular and peaceful
rebellion last autumn.
   From an isolated capitalist island in a sea of Communists,
Berlin has become a symbol of hope. It will be the major European
city between Paris and Moscow, a gateway to the eastern neighbors
who were inspired to push aside Communist governments after the
East Germans showed that their regime was a paper tiger.

<HEAD>Some East Germans Dread the Coming of a United Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the East Germans who helped open the
door to German unity are reluctant to step inside.
   Dissident professor Peter Boethig fled the country just a few
months before its remarkable transformation to a free nation. Now
that he's back, he's not sure he belongs.
   Katje Havemann endured house arrest for more than two years and
fought a lonely fight for change long before huge crowds joined her
on the streets. Now that the Communists have been overthrown,
Havemann presses on with protests against the new government.
   Carl Ordnung works for that government, which won East Germany's
first free elections by promising fast capitalism and quick unity.
But Ordnung now worries about a rise in nationalism and consumer
fever, and says his nation has shifted too far to the right.
   The three are by no means typical of most East Germans, who
passively endured four decades of Soviet-imposed rule, then quickly
embraced a fast merger with West Germany.
   But each to varying degrees took part in what East Germany is
now, a sovereign nation with a democratic government.
   And each feels, in some way, opposed to what it will soon
become, a transplanted territory of West Germany.
   ``In the beginning I was angry,'' Boethig said. ``It was a pity
a basic democratic movement was overtaken by a unification
movement. The sudden materialism, the nationalism.
   ``But I can imagine now why they wanted what they wanted.''
   The 32-year-old Berliner taught German literature at East
Berlin's prestigious Humboldt University and quickly moved into
circles actively opposed to the old Communist government. He edited
an underground literary journal from 1984-88, working with writers
barred from official publications.
   One day the secret police came to the university ``and said I
had to go,'' Boethig said. ``After I left, I couldn't find a job. I
drove cabs, worked in construction. I realized I would have to do
that for a long time.''
   He applied to leave, and like many people considered
troublemakers, was granted a visa in March 1989. Six months later
he got a job teaching German at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Two months after that, his former colleagues were leading
nationwide demonstrations. The Communist government convulsed and
collapsed.
   In May he came back to work with a West Berlin literary society.
The East already had been transormed. The university invited
Boethig back to complete his doctoral dissertation.
   He plans to accept, but finds little in common with East Germany
today. The issues his old activist friends are involved with seem
remote, the consumerism of the freed society saddening.
   ``I had mixed feelings after I returned,'' he said. ``What will
dominate the next years is Germany will be busy with itself.''
   While Boethig spoke last week, Katje Havemann was doing what she
did a decade ago: waging war on the government, this time the new
government.
   Mrs. Havemann is one of East Germany's most lionized activists.
Her husband, Robert, a philosophy professor, renounced the
government in the 1970s and became its most famous dissident.
   The Havemanns spent 2{ years under house arrest, their home
surrounded by secret police.
   He died in 1982, and she carried on to help form New Forum, the
activist group that led the autumn revolt.
   Mrs. Havemann was among 22 activists who occupied the
headquarters of the former secret police Sept. 4 to keep the files
from being turned over to West Germany's intelligence service.
   The group went on a hunger strike Sept. 12.
   ``Many people are concerned now with their social problems,''
she said, referring to the joblessness that followed the nation's
plunge into capitalism.
   But she said she said she fears the united German government
would become too much like the old Communist government if it took
control of the 6 million secret dossiers of the old administration.
   She said she sees no problem with the small crowds that attend
New Forum's rallies these days, compared with the hundreds of
thousands last year.
   ``The big difference between now and last fall? Last fall has
already happened,'' she said.
   New Forum never came up with a clear program for a future East
Germany. But the Christian Democrats, an approved party by the
Communists, reshaped itself after their powerful West German
namesakes.
   The Christian Democrats espoused conservatism and unencumbered
capitalism, quick unity and Western lifestyles. They won the free
elections handily.
   Carl Ordnung, 62, joined the party in 1951 and helped reshape it
last year to fit the new era.
   He now works as a foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere and will, like the government, be out of work
Oct. 3.
   But Ordnung, a Methodist lay preacher, said the party and nation
have swung too far to the right.
   He had hoped for a socialist democracy more sympathetic to poor
people and foreigners, less devoted to a market-driven economy.
   ``I hope East Germans, after they have consumed Western goods,
will see that to consume is not all of human life,'' he said.
   Ordnung's life has paralleled East Germany's. He was married
four days before the nation was created and will celebrate his 41st
anniversary the day it dissolves.
   He was a German army conscript at the end of World War II and
went home to recuperate after he was injured in a training
accident. His mother burned his uniform before the Soviets came.
   He enjoyed travel privileges because of his role in church
circles, but his son, then 16, was imprisoned for 2{ years in 1973
for trying to flee.
   Ordnung believed Germany's division was God's penalty for two
world wars. Unification, he said, is a result of public will.
   ``You should respect the will of the people,'' he said. ``But we
should remember there is another world besides Germany.''

   Here is a brief look at German political leaders:
   ---
   Helmut Kohl: West Germany's chancellor and head of the
conservative Christian Democrats crowns his political career when
he becomes leader of a united Germany on Oct. 3. Kohl, 60, must
emerge victorious from all-German elections Dec. 2 to keep the
post.
   ---
   Lothar de Maiziere: East Germany's prime minister, also a
Christian Democrat, loses his job Oct. 3, but is scheduled to
become a Cabinet minister without portfolio after unity. De
Maiziere, 50, worked as a lawyer before his election as East German
leader earlier this year.
   ---
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher: West Germany's foreign minister takes
charge of the defunct East German foreign service Oct. 3 and will
continue to be a major player in world affairs as the top diplomat
of a nation of 80 million.
   ---
   Wolfgang Schaeuble: West Germany's interior minister is being
tipped as a future Christian Democrat candidate for chancellor
following his smooth handling of negotiations that clinched the
unity treaty, the fundamental document that merges the legal
systems of the two German states.
   ---
   Guenther Krause: Another Christian Democrat, Krause conducted
the unity treaty negotiations for de Maiziere's government. He is
considered a rising star and will get a spot in Kohl's government
after unity.

<HEAD>Brief Portrait of Unified Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Germany Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here at a glance is a portrait of
the united Germany that will be created Oct. 3:
   ---
   THE LAND - Germany will cover 137,743 square miles, more than
half the size of Texas. It combines West Germany's 95,975 square
miles with 41,768 square miles of East German territory. It is
bordered to the north by Denmark and the North and Baltic Seas; by
the Oder-Neisse River, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Austria in the
east; by Austria, Switzerland and France to the south; and France,
Luxembourg, Belgium and The Netherlands to the west.
   ---
   THE PEOPLE - Germany will have at least 77.6 million people, 61
million from West Germany plus 16.6 million in East Germany.
Berlin, with 3 million residents, is the largest city and its
capital, as stated in the treaty uniting the Germanys. Bonn will be
the interim seat of government. The all-German parliament to be
elected Dec. 2 will decide if the seat of government stays in Bonn
or moves to Berlin.
   ---
   ECONOMY - Germany will consist of the most powerful economy of
Western Europe and the most powerful of the East bloc.
Restructuring East Germany's economy to bring it to Western
standards may cost $775 billion. Unemployment in what is now East
Germany could reach 2 million as formerly state-subsidized firms go
bankrupt. Germany has pledged to pay more than $7 billion to the
Soviet Union to pay for the withdrawal of the Red Army from East
German territory.
   ---
   GOVERNMENT - Germany will be a federal democracy, run by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and President Richard von Weizsaecker. The
three now hold those posts in West Germany.
   ---
   HISTORY - East Germany and West Germany were founded in 1949
after the victorious World War II Allies divided Germany. West
Germany makes up the German territory occupied by the United
States, France and Britain. East Germany is composed of territory
occupied by the Soviet Union.
   Germany was first united in 1871 under Kaiser Wilhelm I. The
Weimar Republic replaced the imperial government at the end of
World War I. Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler replaced the parliamentary
government in 1933 and ruled until his defeat in 1945.

   By the time Ronnie Mutimusekwa was 15, he
was sleeping regularly with three different girls. A few years
later, the number had grown to 15 and he was proud to think any
woman he asked would go to bed with him.
   ``I guess I made sex a hobby,'' said the 34-year-old.
   A deadly hobby.
   Mutimusekwa, from Zimbabwe's southern city of Bulawayo,
contracted AIDS. He does not know who gave it to him, nor does he
know who may have caught it from him.
   Behavior like his has contributed to the rapid spread of the
disease in Africa, and has helped make the continent the AIDS
center of the world.
   Two-thirds of the world's estimated AIDS cases are in Africa,
and most of those are concentrated in about 12 countries across the
continent's central, eastern and southern regions.
   The problem only threatens to get worse, according to medical
experts. Infection rates, unlike those in most other areas of the
world, are rising in Africa. If current trends continue, millions
of African infants will be born with the deadly disease, and
Africa's population growth rate - now the world's highest - will be
cut as AIDS kills those in what should be the most productive time
of their lives.
   The Geneva-based World Health Organizaton estimates that in
sub-Saharan Africa, one of every 40 adult men and women is infected
with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. In the United States, which
has recorded about half the world's known cases of AIDS, one of
every 75 men and 700 women has HIV, WHO estimates.
   Because of under-recognition, under-reporting and delays in
reporting, WHO estimates only a fraction of the world's cases of
AIDS and HIV have been recorded.
   As of mid-1990, about 65,000 AIDS cases had been reported from
Africa. But WHO estimates closer to 500,000 adult AIDS cases
probably exist - more than half the estimated global total.
   In what it calls a conservative estimate, the organization says
5 million Africans may be HIV carriers.
   ``AIDS and HIV are becoming more and more a disease of the
developing world,'' said Michael Merson, WHO's anti-AIDS chief, in
a telephone interview from Geneva. ``By the year 2000, we expect 80
percent of the cases to be in the developing world.''
   The organization says about 20 million cases worldwide are
expected by the end of the century.
   Merson includes Latin America when he speaks of AIDS and the
developing world, but WHO statistics show the severity of the
disease in Africa far outstrips any other continent.
   Today, AIDS is the leading cause of death among young adults in
many African countries, said Merson.
   The average African victim, however, differs from his American
or European counterpart, who is usually a homosexual or an
intravenous drug user. In Africa, most AIDS casualties are
heterosexuals. Because of this, the number of women infected
roughly equals the number of men.
   And because many of the infected women are in their prime, HIV
transmission from mother to child is an increasing problem.
   Already this year, about 500,000 children carrying the HIV virus
have been born in Africa, says WHO. The organization estimates an
additional 2 million to 3 million infected infants will be born
before the year 2000. Another 10 million children born to infected
mothers but who will not contract the disease are expected to
become AIDS-related orphans in the 1990s, says WHO.
   Dambudzo, a 26-year-old unemployed Zimbabwean, lost a 2-year-old
daughter to the disease. The divorcee said she learned she had AIDS
while still in the hospital after delivering her baby.
   ``I was really hurt because the baby had also contracted the
disease and whenever she was brought in for breast-feeding, I would
look at her and cry,'' Dambudzo told Ziana, Zimbabwe's news agency.
   Dambudzo's husband also tested positive for the disease. But
rather than engage in safer habits, she said he stopped sleeping
with her and started bringing other women home to bed.
   Such negligent promiscuity, as well as a tradition of polygamy
among many African peoples, a high incidence of other sexually
transmitted diseases, particularly those that create sores, and
centuries-old customs are encouraging AIDS' spread.
   In Zambia, for instance, where 3,000 AIDS cases have been
recorded but many times that are believed to exist, a custom among
the Kaonde tribe demands that when a man dies, a male relative must
sleep with the widow to exorcise ghosts.
   Enough people will be dying of AIDS in the next 10 years that
African population growth rates, the highest in the world, are
expected to slow, says WHO. Beyond the year 2000, if current trends
continue, populations could even decline, according to the U.N.
organization.
   Already along the east-west corridor of countries from Kenya to
Ivory Coast, the hardest-hit West African country, villages are
being decimated by the virus.
   In southeastern Uganda, where the majority of that country's
AIDS cases have been recorded, residents of Rakai said as many as
six people were dying daily by 1988.
   Fred Ssonko, manager of a local hotel, said at the time he was
going to burials ``almost every afternoon.''
   The 35-year-old took on the extra care of eight children he
adopted after his brother and his best friend died of the illness.
   While education and awareness programs have changed behavior and
slowed the rate of new infections in Europe and America, the rates
are increasing at an ``alarming rate'' in African and other Third
World countries, according to WHO.
   Despite internationally-funded AIDS prevention programs
throughout the continent, Africa still lacks the resources to mount
educational campaigns that reach all its 500 million people.
   ``We know that a lot of people know about HIV and AIDS. But we
don't know enough yet about getting their behavior to change,''
said Merson.
   ``We want to get safer sexual practices and more condoms used,''
he said. ``And it's very important to treat other sexually
transmitted diseases.''
   However, even some of those most at risk and who are easily
accessible still don't believe AIDS is a real threat.
   Surveys have found that 60 percent to 80 percent of the
prostitutes in some large east and central African cities are
infected with HIV.
   However, in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, some prostitutes
interviewed recently by a local paper said they thought the figures
were just propaganda for government-backed family planning
programs.
   One AIDS prevention program being run by the Nairobi-based
African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) is targeting a
highly vulnerable population that health workers credit with
fueling the virus' spread: long-distance truckers.
   Since the disease first was recorded in Africa in 1983, medical
researchers have found AIDS spreading most quickly along trucking
routes, with a high incidence of cases at popular roadside stops
through southern, eastern and central Africa.
   AMREF is distributing free condoms to the local prostitutes
there and to drivers who frequent them as well as handing out
pamphlets that explain AIDS' causes and symptoms. The material
urges the truckers to refrain from casual sex.
   Ominously, while AIDS used to be concentrated primarily in urban
areas along major roads, it is now appearing in rural areas where
an estimated 75 percent of the population lives.
   ``It means the epidemic is continuing to rise and Africa is
being confronted by a major problem,'' said Merson. ``It is nowhere
near its peak.''

   ``Glory'' (RCA-Columbia. VHS-Beta. Rated R)
   
   On July 18, 1863, despite fatigue and poor rations, the 54th
Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Infantry marched across a half-mile
of sand on a South Carolina beach to lead the ill-planned attack on
Fort Wagner in Charleston harbor. The regiment lost more than 40
percent of its men.
   The story of the 54th, the first black regiment from the North
to fight in the Civil War, and its youthful white colonel, Robert
Gould Shaw, unfolds in ``Glory,'' Edward Zwick's critically
acclaimed movie.
   Zwick presents a powerful, moving tapestry of war's
senselessness. The screenplay by Kevin Jarre is partly based on the
books ``Lay This Laurel'' and ``One Gallant Rush,'' and letters
Shaw wrote home to his parents. The movie - narrated by Matthew
Broderick as Shaw - is largely seen through his eyes.
   Young and privileged, but disillusioned and battle-scarred after
the gory and indecisive Battle of Antietam, Shaw returns to his
wealthy, powerful and abolitionist parents in Massachusetts just in
time for a lavish party and an offer from the governor to take
command of an all-black fighting regiment.
   He rises in rank from captain to colonel and musters his men,
who include his childhood friends, Cabot (Cary Elwes), who is white
and becomes a major, and Tom (Andre Braugher), a second-generation
free black who volunteers as an enlisted man.
   Much of ``Glory'' focuses on the basic training of a ragtag
group of runaway slaves and free men, who are asked to accept less
pay than whites and denied all the basic supplies, including proper
shoes and the coveted blue uniform.
   As Trip, an embittered runaway, Denzel Washington (``Cry
Freedom,'' ``The Mighty Quinn,'' ``Power'') does a star turn.
``Glory'' becomes Trip's story - as well as Shaw's - as the runaway
undergoes a radical self-realization. In the end, the 54th becomes
the only family he's ever known.
   Zwick, the Emmy-award winning director of ``Special Bulletin''
and ``thirtysomething,'' stresses visual acting in ``Glory.''
Action speaks louder than words, and he focuses on facial
expressions and body movement rather than histrionics and gimmicks.
   He also is spare with dialogue. When the 54th marches past the
white regiments, who regarded the black soldiers as a joke and less
than men, to lead the assault against Fort Wagner, only four words
are spoken by the once hostile whites: ``Give 'em hell, 54.''
   Ultimately, color no longer is the issue. The men are fellow
soldiers about to die. And like ``Gallipoli'' and ``Hamburger
Hill,'' the overriding issue becomes the utter futility of war.
   The battle scene at Fort Wagner is beautifully choreographed,
the men running along the beach, the U.S. flag full and billowing.
It is poetic and powerful.
   ``Glory'' makes good use of battle scenes. They are exciting,
frightening and realistic. At James Island, the 54th gets its first
taste of fighting. After firing a few rounds and watching a
Confederate unit retreat, more Confederates appear through the mist
like gray ghosts and the battle soon becomes hand-to-hand combat.
Dan Lerner was second unit director, and Bob Minor coordinated the
stunts.
   There are good performances by Morgan Freeman (``Street Smart,''
``Driving Miss Daisy''), Jihmi Kennedy as a stuttering enlisted man
and John Finn as the fierce, no-nonsense Irish sergeant-major who
whips the 54th into shape. Braugher, whose theater credits include
``Much Ado About Nothing'' and ``King John'' at the New York
Shakespeare Festival, makes his film debut in ``Glory,'' and is
someone to watch. Jane Alexander appears as Shaw's mother.
   ``Glory'' only received three Academy Awards and was denied the
best picture prize. Pity, it was a superior movie and one that will
haunt you long after seeing it.
   RCA-Columbia smartly is releasing ``Glory'' in letterbox form in
order to retain the full picture for the small screen. It works,
and it works well. Regard this video as a classic.

   ``Stanely &amp; Iris'' (MGM-UA. VHYS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG-13)
   
   Boy, how can you criticize a movie that tries to teach the value
of literacy, stars Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro and even plans to
donate part of its video proceeds to help people learn to read?
   Well, for all the good it might do, ``Stanley &amp; Iris'' is just
sort of sappy. Too bad, because it has a great cast, which also
includes Swoosie Kurtz and Martha Plimpton.
   The actors do their best to play down the melodrama that
intrudes at every turn: Iris King (Fonda), tough and newly widowed,
chases a guy who snatched her purse and gets in a fight; Iris
supports her unemployed and battling sister and brother-in-law;
Iris' daughter gets pregnant while in high school; Stanley gets
fired because he can't read; because he has no job, he has to put
his elderly father in a home, where the man soon dies. You get the
idea.
   Based on the novel ``Union Street,'' by Pat Barker, ``Stanley &amp;
Iris,'' has some nice moments, including the convivial scenes of
Iris and her co-workesr on a bakery assembly line and the romance
that grows in fits and starts between Stanley and Iris as she lets
him into her life and teaches him to read.
   Director Martin Ritt filmed ``Stanley &amp; Iris,'' in Waterbury,
Conn., where veterans groups demonstrated in protest of Fonda's
presence because of her work against the Vietnam War.

   ``Never too Much'' (MCA Records) - Henry Johnson
   With his third MCA record, guitarist Henry Johnson says he is
trying to fill the void between strictly commercial music and
straight-ahead jazz. That is more void than any one musician could
fill, but Johnson makes a good attempt.
   Punched up drums and percussion, keyboard overlays and some
rather bland arrangements give this record its commercial feel.
Johnson is able to break free from those constraints often enough
to keep things interesting. Listening to the Chicago-born Johnson,
it is clear he is capable of making much more interesting,
challenging music.
   Even so, ``Never too Much'' is a cut above the New Age elevator
music so prevalent today on the airwaves and in the record bins.

   Four Impromptus, D. 935; 12 Landler, D. 790; Three Klaverstucke,
D946; Allegretto, D. 915, by Franz Schubert (London) - Andras
Schiff, piano
   The best of Schubert's small-scale piano pieces belong to that
special category of art works which are simple in form yet truly
complex in experience because of the way they touch us so deeply.
Many of Domenico Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas have this quality.
Nothing, perhaps, has it more than Schubert's impromptus.
   Andras Schiff has recorded both for London, most recently the
four Opus 142 Impromptus on this disc.
   Schiff has all the right instincts in his choice of recording
repertoire - great taste, and also adventurousness, as shown by
last year's issue of him playing Dohnanyi chamber music and
Dvorak's piano concerto, performed live.
   On the Schubert disc, his technique is wonderful, his approach
sensitive, his interpretations well thought-out. Even the disc
booklet is appealingly simple in its layout and notes.
   So, mainly in the impromptus, one misses all the more that extra
quality of bringing us into a special realm, that focus on the
depth of simple works.
   In the A-flat Imprompu, for instance, the middle section is a
marvel of lyricisim, with a lower-upper register dialogue
accompanied by an excruciatingly beautiful harmonic progression.
But Schiff handles the passage without extraordinary poignancy.
Nevertheless, he manages moments of charm and poetry at other
times.
   The recorded sound is fair. Schiff's Bosendorfer piano has a
thudding quality. At 74:26, the CD is generously timed.

   ``Under the Red Sky'' (Columbia) - Bob Dylan
   Bob Dylan's ``Under the Red Sky'' is a lot like Dylan's concerts
of the last two years. Bob storms onstage and whales away at some
surprisingly tough rock 'n' roll and is gone before you know it. If
you catch a flash of brilliance, great. If not, tough luck.
   Much of this album sounds simply haphazard, as if Dylan
scribbled a few lyrics on a sheet of paper five minutes before
entering the studio. This master lyricist has become enamored of
the somewhat lazy device of repeating key lyrical phrases over and
over (``Wiggle Wiggle,'' ``10,000 Men'' and ``God Knows''). By his
own formidable standards, this is minor work.
   Those flashes of brilliance are there, however. ``God Knows''
has an elegance about it. ``T.V. Talkin' Song'' pokes wicked fun at
the television generation. Television will ``scramble up your head
and drag your brain about,'' he sings. ``Sometimes you gotta do
like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.''
   When Bob Dylan calls, musicians come running - Bruce Hornsby,
Jimmie and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, George Harrison, Elton
John, David Crosby, Slash of Guns N' Roses, drummer Kenny Aronoff
and Don and David Was. Consequently, this album sounds
simultaneously impeccably played and a loose good time.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The World's a Stage for Julie Christie</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Fools of Fortune'' opens Oct. 5.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julie Christie doesn't make many films these
days, and rarely sees her old movies.
   She was thrilled to work with such directors as John Schlesinger
and Sir David Lean, and amazed she had the courage to arrive on the
set each day. But don't expect her to recite dialogue from those
movies.
   Now 49, and feeling much calmer, the Academy Award winner and
icon of 1960s ``Swinging London'' prefers to think of the locations
where she made the films. There's India, the setting for ``Heat and
Dust''; Canada, where she made ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller''; and
Ireland, which provided Christie with happy memories of the recent
``Fools of Fortune.''
   ``The Irish are the most generous people, the most wonderful
people,'' she said enthusiastically, looking relaxed in a blue knit
shirt, her blond hair cheerfully uncombed. A children's birthday
celebration goes on in another room of a friend's Manhattan
apartment where Christie stays when she's in town.
   ``It makes you happy, the touches of kindness that you get every
single day. It makes you happy to be there because people are so
extraordinarily nice. It sounds patronizing, doesn't it? The Irish
have an incredibly nice nature, and they haven't got an
anti-English bias, though they have every right to.''
   Christie is very much the well-traveled performer, veteran of
stage, screen and Warren Beatty. Even growing up, home was
whereever they built the set. She was born in India, but spent her
childhood at a series of English boarding schools, finding
contentment by performing in school plays.
   She lived for a year in Paris and established herself in films
in 1963 with a brief appearance in Schlesinger's ``Billy Liar.''
Christie topped it two years later by winning a best actress Oscar
for ``Darling,'' playing the shallow, free-spirited London model
who tells her life story to a reporter for a woman's magazine.
   ``You just think they made a terrible mistake,'' she said of the
Academy Award. ``You feel terrible because you can't believe it's
happening. You're just thinking, `What am I doing there? What the
hell am I doing there?'
   ``For a long time I didn't put it anywhere; a friend of mine had
it. I was too embarrassed by it. What a stupid cow I was! Then I
grew up a little bit more and thought, `Wonderful, look what I've
got,' '' she said, sounding just like a gleeful as kid who just
found a $5 bill.
   After starring as Lara in ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Christie traveled
some more. She lived in California during the 1970s and worked with
Beatty, her boyfriend for several years and co-star of ``Shampoo,''
``Heavan Can Wait'' and ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' shot in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   ```McCabe' was a wonderful location because (director) Robert
Altman made it a wonderful location. We were shooting nights in
Vancouver and it was where people who didn't want to go to the
Vietnam War went instead,'' she said.
   ``It was a very vital place, a wonderful place. All these people
were living in the mountains, very self-sufficient. And Robert got
them to be the townspeople. They built everything from day one.
Some of them ended up living on the sets during the shooting.''
   She moved back to England at the end of the '70s, became
increasingly outspoken politically - and traveled. She made the
acclaimed ``Heat and Dust,'' returning to her native India, and
worked in Argentina for ``Miss Mary,'' a commercial flop but a
personal success.
   ``There's an interesting thing about being British and having
come from an enormous empire country. You go to countries like
Argentina which suffered appallingly from English imperialism. They
see someone from Britain as a continuation of that imperialism. I
had to get over their reticence.
   ``Coming to the United States I'm aware of that same feeling the
Argentines had. I get the same feeling of people feeling superior
to everyone else, just in little drops. Remarks here and there, an
attitude that people don't know as much in the backward countries.
It's a superiority complex that all great empires have.''
   In ``Fools of Fortune,'' based on the novel by William Trevor,
Christie plays the English wife of an Irishman murdered by British
military police during the Irish Republicans' uprising after World
War I. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Iain Glen also star.
   Christie takes an emotional trip in ``Fools of Fortune,'' warm
and outgoing at the beginning of the film, embittered and
increasingly unstable after her husband's murder.
   If in person Christie seems closer to the life-affirming woman
of the film's first half, as an actress she related to the angry,
single-minded personality of the second half, a world traveler
unafraid to cross boundaries of any kind.
   ``There's a scene that's missing which I wished had been in,''
she said. ``She talks to her son and explains her family had always
been involved with the struggle for home rule for Ireland. She
explains for a Protestant-English person, that is an extremely
unusual thing.
   ``I identified with that anger and injustice. Her heartbreak and
rage that the man who killed her husband was receiving no
retribution at all. What is it like to go through a transition like
that woman went through? You go through sort of a journey. The work
is really a journey.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Controversial Contemporary Museum Making Waves in
Nice</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paintings splattered from a carbine by Niki
de St. Phalle, or squashed cars hung as art by Cesar may not be to
everyone's taste.
   But the handsome new Museum of Contemporary Art in the heart of
the Riviera's capital is nevertheless an impressive contribution to
the city, not least because of its monumental modern architecture.
   The museum opened amid controversy in June, boycotted by several
local artists and France's culture minister, Jack Lang.
   Conceived by Nice's longtime mayor, Jacques Medecin, the
multimillion-dollar museum and theater was financed mainly by the
city, with other funds coming from regional and national government
sources.
   The museum had a rough start because of Medecin's right-wing
politics, coupled with alleged financial fiddling that still have
the mayor in hot water. He was accused of anti-semitic remarks last
spring at a time when desecrations of Jewish cemeteries in France
and elsewhere were causing a storm of protest.
   Medecin is an avowed admirer of Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose
far-right National Front espouses anti-immigrant causes. That
attitude is shared by many older conservatives enjoying the high
life of Nice.
   Perhaps more serious are allegations that Medecin has cheated on
personal taxes as well as in financial deals involving the city. He
is currently under investigation.
   In any case, the new museum daily is attracting about 1,000
visitors, according to spokesmen.
   ``I don't discuss controversy. It's in the past, and I'm looking
to the future,'' said head curator Pierre Chaigneau, an art expert
who has helped open several other important museums and distances
himself from politics.
   He is proud of this museum's strictly contemporary role in an
area that already boasts some excellent museums - Nice's Museum of
Fine Arts, the national Chagall Museum there, the prestigious
Maeght Foundation at St. Paul de Vence, the Leger Musem at Biot.
   ``This is the only one dedicated exclusively to art from 1950
onwards,'' said Chaigneau, who personally favors geometric abstract
works in the line of Josef Albers and Max Bill.
   Emphasizing neo-realism from the 1960s, pop art by such artists
as Warhol and Lichtenstein, as well as minimalist and other trends,
the museum's displays include about 20-25 percent of works by
American artists.
   The School of Nice, spearheaded by such artists as Yves Klein,
Armand and Martial Raysse, is well-represented. The museum is
especially proud of its large collection of Kleins -
three-dimensional electric blue figures on various backgrounds, by
the local artist who made international art news before his
untimely death at age 34 in 1962.
   But it's the handsome museum complex itself of which Nice can be
most proud.
   Just behind the old city, the gray Carrara marble-faced
structure designed by local architects Yves Bayard and Henri Vidal
includes an octagonal theater and a plaza connecting with four
monolithic towers housing the art on three levels.
   Access is easy by way of a red-brick staircase entrance flanked
by escalators, and entry is free of charge - a rarity in France.
   At the top of the staircase, the visitor is dazzled by sun on
marble and a handsome Alexander Calder stabile, a gift by the
artist to Nice in 1970.
   The towers are joined by corridors of glass and steel, decorated
on the interior by vaguely fish-shaped metallic ellipses and hung
with colorful metal stabiles.
   In the towers are spacious, well-lighted exhibition rooms, ideal
for a handsome display of monumental-sized abstracts by such
artists as Morris Louis, Frank Stella or Jim Dine.
   With a restaurant tucked into a corner facing the first-level
plaza, and theater and a little cafe at the top level, the complex
is equipped to become a gathering-place for Nicois and visitors.
   From the top of the museum are fabulous views over old Nice to
the Mediterranean, a Jewish cemetery and the green slopes of the
Cimiez area.
   One of the rooftop areas contains a grid of gas jets constructed
to an Yves Klein design that sparkles in the evening with jets of
blue flame. A little rooftop garden is planted with typically
Riviera succulents and flowers, based on Klein's notes for a dream
garden.
   While some Nice residents leave quizzical remarks in the
visitor's book about the art, the only real complaints so far seem
to be from animal-lovers and pigeons. Apparently some pigeons died
when stuck to the bird-repellent spread along the rooftop walls -
``An unfortunate accident that we're striving to correct,'' said
Chaigneau.

   Dressed in jeans and white T-shirts, calmly
puffing Marlboros, Marti Jones and husband Don Dixon look as if
they make records with all the urgency of vacuuming the living room
carpet.
   But they have plenty to worry about. Jones' first three albums,
produced by Dixon, sold poorly despite mostly favorable reviews,
and the singer has switched record labels, from A&amp;M to RCA, hoping
her luck will change.
   With just a few ``pockets of popularity'' - New York, Washington
- paying the bills, disagreements can emerge. On ``Any Kind of
Lie,'' the arguments are in the lyrics themselves.
   Even talking about the record gets them going.
   ``It was real easy,'' Jones insisted during an interview at the
RCA offices in Manhattan. ``We stayed home for about 2{ months.
We'd get up and Dixon would be working on something and I'd be
cleaning up the kitchen, or wanting to do laundry or go see my
mother or something.
   ``And he'd say, `I just want to work on this song,' and I knew
when I came back if I didn't do something he'd have it finished.''
   ``It took a long time,'' countered Dixon, flicking an ash. ``We
started this record from scratch. We were trying to figure out what
to do. The biggest difference in this record from Marti's other
records is this is more groove based. It's a little bit more of a
band record.''
   Sometimes, the only way to break through the Jones-Dixon line
and get the whole story is to take their responses and split the
difference. In ``My Tears Are Poison,'' they make like Sonny and
Cher in a trailer park, tossing verbal pots and pans about money
and television and pets and babies.
   ``We're like Buddy and Sally of the `Dick Van Dyke Show,' ''
Jones said of the bickering scriptwriting team from the old
television series. ``When we would think of what to say on stage,
we'd say, `What would they do now? Would she do this or she do
that.' ''
   They met in the early 1980s, when Jones was struggling with a
band called Color Me Gone and Dixon, who had produced R.E.M., was
called in to help. Color Me Gone soon fell apart but Dixon was
impressed with Jones' singing and suggested they work together.
   That's when the trouble began.
   ``We wrote through the mail,'' recalled Jones, who lives with
Dixon in her native Ohio, and also spends time in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``I sent these lyrics to Dixon and he called me and said, `I got
your lyrics and on the way home from the post office I wrote the
song,' which was called `Rhythm and Shallow Breathing.' I was real
impressed. I was like, `Wow!' Then I found out there's this old
song he had and he just adapted it into this.''
   Until ``Any Kind of Lie,'' they preferred to let others do the
arguing. Cover versions of Graham Parker's ``You Can't Take Love
for Granted'' and Elvis Costello's ``Just a Memory'' earned her
respect among musicians, and so did her willingness to perform
songs by lesser-known writers such as Dwight Twilley and Richard
Barone.
   But after the 1988 album ``Used Guitars,'' Jones and Dixon took
a different approach. Before, they wrote just two or three songs
per record. On ``Any Kind of Lie,'' only two of the 11 songs are
nonoriginals.
   Jones gives two reasons: They were unimpressed with the outside
material submitted and, after watching some so-called pros at work,
they figured some of their own songs might be salvageable.
   With Jones and Dixon doing most of the writing, ``Any Kind of
Lie'' has a more consistent sound than ``Used Guitars,'' which
ranges from the jazzy ``Ruby'' to a folkish cover of John Hiatt's
``If I Can Love Somebody.''
   How it sounds to Jones and Dixon depends on which one you ask.
Again, it's Buddy and Sally time, a battle of selective memories,
with Jones leaning forward while she speaks and Dixon preferring to
recline.
   Jones: ``I think this record is sort of the relaxed version of
`Used Guitars.' ''
   Dixon: `` `Used Guitars' is real atmospheric.''
   Jones: ``It is, it's more bouyant. This is more mature.''
   Dixon: ``I think this is a real rock 'n' roll album.''
   Jones: ``This is real relaxed. I wasn't worried about the songs.
I wasn't worried about how it was going to turn out. There was not
a point where I was nervous. ... (Dixon is shaking his head) Of
course, I was worried the way I sounded singing. I completely
freaked out.''

<HEAD>NEW YORK - William Wyler.</HEAD>

   But Sturges insisted directors were ``princes of the blood,''
the ones who were really in charge. By 1939, he was so anxious for
a chance to direct he offered to accept a salary of $1 (his
screenplays usually brought him $30,000 or more) if he could make a
film of ``Down Went McGinty,'' a political satire he had written
several years before. Paramount gave in, even upping his pay to
$10.
   ``I saved my strength; I treated myself like an egg,'' wrote
Sturges, who gave up drinking and smoking in preparation for the
film. ``And as a result of this totally regular and totally
unaccustomed manner of living, on the 14th day of shooting I was
rewarded with pneumonia.''
   Sturges was convinced he had blown it, but Paramount executives
were so happy with the scenes he had filmed so far they sent a
messenger to the director's hospital bed to inform him they would
wait indefinitely for his recovery.
   ``My fever slid down like a monkey on a flagpole, and I was back
on the set in 10 days,'' Sturges wrote.
   ``The Great McGinty,'' as it was eventually called, was a hit
and earned Sturges an Academy Award in 1940 for the new category of
best original screenplay. And thanks to Sturges, frustrated writers
such as John Huston and Billy Wilder also were allowed to make
films and became great directors themselves.
   Sturges made ``Christmas in July,'' ``Sullivan's Travels,''
``The Lady Eve,'' ``The Palm Beach Story,'' ``The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek'' and ``Hail the Conquering Hero'' during the next
four years. They are among the wittiest movies ever made, and are
included in a current Film Forum retrospective in New York.
   Deception or mistaken identity was often a theme in Sturges
movies. In ``The Lady Eve,'' Barbara Stanwyck plays a cardsharp,
then a phony British heiress. Eddie Bracken is wrongly thought to
be a war hero in ``Conquering Hero,'' and Dick Powell falsely
believes he has won a contest for writing a coffee slogan in
``Christmas in July.''
   Sturges, a tall, powerfully built man with wavy black hair and a
thin mustache, filmed in the afternoon, played host at his
nightclub in the evening and then wrote until the early morning. He
rarely knew where the story would go once he started, and began
filming ``Morgan's Creek'' with just 10 pages of dialogue.
   He loved working with McCrae, Stanwyck and Claudette Colbert,
but also cultivated a stock company of such motley mountebanks as
the fumbling Raymond Walburn, the eccentric Jimmy Conlin and the
cranky William Demarest, who had featured parts in ``Morgan's
Creek'' and ``Conquering Hero.''
   But in 1943, after completing ``Conquering Hero,'' Sturges had a
falling out with Paramount and left to form a film company with the
reclusive billionare Howard Hughes.
   It was a disaster. Sturges made the poorly regarded ``The Sin of
Harold Diddlebock,'' which Hughes soon pulled from circulation, and
the partnership dissolved.
   Sturges never recovered. ``Unfaithfully Yours,'' released by Fox
in 1948, did poorly at the box office despite considerable
publicity, and ``The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend'' fared
even worse the following year.
   Unable to catch on with any of the studios, Sturges spent the
last decade of his life watching deal after deal fall through,
reduced to minor acting roles and assisting on screenplays.
   To Sandy Sturges, his fatal heart attack in August 1959, just 20
minutes after he had completed his autobiography, still doesn't
make sense. He had three deals in the works and had been assured by
a doctor three months earlier that he was in perfect health and
could expect to live another 25 years.
   He felt confident enough to even joke about his age, wanting to
call his book ``The Events Leading Up to My Death,'' and likening
his 60th birthday to being a passenger at an ainport but not having
a flight arranged.
   Like Sullivan, he always stopped in time from taking himself too
seriously. Sturges had thought about writing a book with a
``message,'' words of wisdom for his young children, a lifetime of
mistakes he hoped would never be repeated.
   But he realized that might have turned out like a bad version of
``O Brother, Where Art Thou?,'' an inappropriate farewell from a
man who thought the best time to cry came at the tail end of
laughter so hard the tears were squeezed out of your eyes.

   Master guitarist Chet Atkins figures
he's due for a new image.
   The 66-year-old, soft-spoken music legend may start emulating
certain rock stars by wearing leather and heavy makeup. ``Nobody
wants you when you just play guitar,'' he laments.
   But he's not serious. He's just joking around with Dire Straits'
guitarist Mark Knopfler, his special guest on the new album ``Neck
and Neck.''
   Atkins hardly needs any special strategy at this stage of his
career.
   He's already earned the title ``Mr. Guitar'' during his 45 years
as an instrumentalist. He's recorded more than 75 albums and sold
in excess of 30 million records.
   However, on ``Neck and Neck,'' Atkins returns to the country
music style he helped popularize. Even the presence of a rock 'n'
roller such as Knopfler, the producer of the album, can't hide the
country feel to it.
   ``I've been making so-called jazz albums for the past three or
four years,'' Atkins said in an interview in his Music Row office
before heading to a golf course to pursue his hobby.
   ``So in this album, we got away from that and got back to more
country sounding things for the most part. Mark thought I was going
in the wrong direction lately.''
   In the LP, they play and sing on such well-known songs as
``There'll Be Some Changes Made,'' ``I'll See You in My Dreams''
and ``Sweet Dreams.''
   ``I think it will appeal to a lot of people around the world
where Mark's fans are,'' Atkins said. ``I don't know yet how it
will be accepted in this country. There seems to be a great deal of
conformity in this country where they play the same things.''
   Atkins has collaborated with top contemporary artists including
George Benson, Larry Carlton, Earl Klugh and Les Paul. There's a
reason.
   ``It's a lot easier because when I play, I improvise,'' he said.
``I never play the same chorus twice. So when I'm playing with
someone, he will play something that gives me a fresh idea.
   ``If I'm playing by myself, I might just fall back on cliches
and play the same thing over and over. But someone like Mark plays
licks that inspire me and gives stimulus to an idea I might come up
with.''
   He describes Knopfler, now with the Notting Hillbillies, as a
distinctive guitarist.
   ``He plays with his right hand and he's a left hander. So he has
a lot of strength in his left hand. He can get a vibrato with three
strings instead of one like most people because his hand is so
strong,'' Atkins said.
   ``He's a great noodler, if you know what noodlin' is. He can
improvise all over the place - on and on.''
   Atkins, who has won eight Grammy awards, says he keeps doing
albums in an eternal quest for perfection.
   ``I never have gotten it right,'' he says modestly about his
playing. ``I keep trying to improve and get it the way I want it
and keep out the mediocrity and conformity.
   ``I never listen to my records. I hope I never get so I love to
listen to myself. I think that's one of the reasons I've been
around so long, because I don't like the way I'm doing. I keep
changing and playing a few new things so that I haven't become
entirely predictable to the average person out there.''
   Atkins is renowned among musicians for refining the
thumb-and-finger picking technique in which the thumb plays the
bass notes and keeps time while the fingers play the melody lines.
   ``Guitar Player'' magazine has named him the most influential
stylist in his field.
   He has made important behind-the-scenes contributions to music,
too. As the former head of RCA Records' Nashville division, he was
responsible for helping to sign and produce records for dozens of
entertainers including Elvis Presley and Dolly Parton.
   This summer he did an 18-city tour, dubbed ``The Sweet Corn
Show,'' with ``Prairie Home Companion'' creator Garrison Keillor.
   Never one to enjoy life without a project in the works, Atkins
will begin production soon on his next album, ``Fingerpickin',''
with longtime pal Jerry Reed.

   Art dealer Leo Castelli will head a nationwide
effort in the art world effort to raise election funds for Harvey
Gantt, who is running against Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Helms has led the fight to restrict the National Endowment for
the Arts' public funding of the arts.
   Key to the art world campaign strategy is the production of a
series of original, signed, limited-edition prints created and
donated by a group of American artists. The artists' prints will be
used as incentive gifts to contributors of $1,000 who also bring in
a matching gift of $1,000.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Liam Neeson, Sir John Gielgud and Joel
Richardson have joined the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's
``Shining Through,'' which co-stars Michael Douglas and Melanie
Griffith.
   The film, which will be made in association with Sandollar
Productions, will start shooting Oct. 1 in London, Berlin and
Austria.
   A romantic spy thriller set during World War II, ``Shining
Through'' is based on the best-selling novel by Susan Isaacs and
chronicles the daring adventure of a Brooklyn-born secretary who is
sent on a one-time mission to gather information on a high ranking
Nazi officer.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The American Council for the Arts has received a
$33,500 grant from the Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation to develop
and operate a toll-free information hotline serving visual artists
nationwide.
   The hotline, which is to begin service in October, will allow
visual artists to call from anywhere in the United States and reach
the Arts Resource Consortium Library. Library staff will match the
specific interests of callers with a database of information
resources.
   Primarily a referral service, the hotline will give visual
artists details on where to go and who to contact regarding such
areas as funding, housing, insurance, health and law.
   Included in the database will be foundations and government
programs funding visual artists, programs of arts councils, arts
service organizations and others who provide information, technical
assistance or other services to visual artists.
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) - Among the more ambitious projects from Columbia
Records is the release of ``Robert Johnson - The Complete
Recordings.''
   Part of the record company's ``Roots 'n Blues'' series, the set
of two compact discs covers Johnson's 29 known songs in 41 existing
takes.
   Many of the recordings in the series - of such masters as Big
Bill Broonzy, Lonnie Johnson and Willie Dixon - are from the
private collection of Lawrence Cohn, producer of the series. Cohn
was at Columbia during the 1960s blues revival.
   Johnson's incredible guitar playing influenced a legion of
contemporary artists. Eric Clapton, who has a personal note in the
CD set, covered Johnson's ``Cross Road Blues.'' The Rolling Stones
did his ``Love in Vain,'' Paul Butterfield covered ``Walking
Blues'' and Canned Heat recorded ``Hellhound on my Trail.''
   Johnson recorded in 1936-37 in San Antonio and Dallas.

   Oil soared over $35 per barrel for another
record on the futures market after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
gave traders the jitters by telling his citizens to prepare for
war.
   Light sweet crude for delivery in November, the nearest month
available, traded as high as $35.60 per barrel Friday before

   NEW YORK (AP) - Chase Manhattan Corp., hoping to squelch rumors
of worsening financial trouble, revealed plans to bolster the No. 2
U.S. bank's cushion for potentially bad loans, halve its stock
dividend and eliminate 5,000 jobs in a painful cost-cutting
strategy.
   A loss of about $625 million is expected in the third quarter
after Chase adds $650 million to its loan-loss provision and takes
a $350 million one-time accounting charge against earnings to cover
the costs of a previously announced restructuring, Chase said
Friday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Finance officials of the world's seven richest
nations said Saturday that spiraling oil prices pose a twin threat
to the global economy: higher inflation and slower growth.
   The Group of Seven, in their first meeting since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, discussed coordinated economic policies to keep
the global economy from falling victim to Mideast turmoil.
   After a full day of talks, the officials issued a communique
noting ``that the rise in the price of oil associated with the gulf
crisis poses two risks: a risk of inflation and a risk of lower
economic growth.''
   They said ``stability-oriented monetary policies and sound
fiscal policies constitute the correct policy response.''

   WASHINGTON - Depositors withdrew a record $15.1 billion from the
nation's savings and loans in April, the government said in another
confirmation of the rapid retrenchment gripping the industry.
   The net withdrawal, which was somewhat offset by $2.9 billion in
interest credited to savers' accounts, reduced deposits at the
2,839 S&amp;Ls to $916 billion, the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision said Friday.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A judge refused to reduce Charles H.
Keating's $5 million bail, ruling that the central figure in the
nation's most expensive savings and loan collapse was a flight
risk.
   Bail was reduced for three co-defendants named in a 42-count
criminal fraud indictment, but Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner
said Friday that numerous civil lawsuits and the threat of prison
gave Keating ``significant reasons not to stick around.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal regulators filed a $200 million suit

Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, accusing them of
``gross negligence'' contributing to the institution's collapse.

Corp. in U.S. District Court in Denver, said the defendants
``repeatedly breached their duties'' to the Denver-based
institution and its depositors.

   TORONTO (AP) - About 12,800 Canadian Auto Workers union members
ended a 9-day-old strike against Ford Motor Co.'s Canada subsidiary
by overwhelmingly approving a new contract Sunday.
   The CAW members voted 91 percent in favor of the tentative
agreement reached Friday.
   The strike, which started Sept. 15, had idled Ford's nine
Canadian plants, all in Ontario. Production at Ford's U.S. plants,
some of which rely on Canadian components, had been threatened by
the strike, company officials said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Aon Corp. withdrew its unsolicited $840 million
bid for fellow insurer Corroon &amp; Black Corp. after its target

   The move Friday allows Corroon &amp; Black and the British insurance
firm Willis Faber PLC to proceed with their proposed stock-swap
merger, a deal valued at more than $750 million.

environmentalists say is necessary to protect the endangered owl
and the old-growth forest it inhabits.

activity in battered bank issues. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials dropped 5.94 to 2,512.38, extending its loss for the

   Bond prices fell sharply in quiet trading as crude oil prices

<TEXT>
   For a nation that extols the virtues of living
within your income, there's an awful lot of borrowing going on,
enough to christen the 1980s, a bit belatedly, as the decade of
deep debt. . .
   . . .and perhaps not prematurely, to call the decade of the
1990s the time in which the bills came due, the wreckage assessed,
and an effort made to clear accounts and get the economy back on
the straight and narrow.
   The phenomenon is a living presence in millions of American
households in the form of credit cards and other installment
credit, automobile loans, home mortgages, education loans, broker
loans.
   And at work. American corporations took on more debt in the
1980s than anyone ever imagined before. Since 1983, about $500
billion worth of equities have been removed from the market, most
of it replaced by debt.
   And in government. The Federal government has been running up
annual deficits for two decades, and despite an interest-rate
burden that is now one of its biggest budget items, it will
continue to borrow for years.
   Many state and municipal governments too are in a deep-debt
state, and some are facing crises that cannot be exaggerated. New
York is only recently resurrected from near-bankruptcy but some
other cities are heading toward it.
   About $2 billion of government-backed student loans appear
uncollectable. The insurance fund protecting commercial loan
deposits might need help. Savings and loans losses are at $130
billion, and may head higher.
   Taxpayers eventually will pay for those losses, of course,
because their hard work is where the bucks originate. But the
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corporation is hardly the only
government-backed program in trouble.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Housing
Administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seem destined to
lose again this year. About half of farm loans by the Farmers Home
Administration are in default.
   There's a lot more federally backed debt than that, as you might
surmise, but much of it will never appear in the official budget
deficit figures because the government simply shoved them away.
They are ``off budget.''
   Past-due real estate loans at banks climbed $3.2 billion in the
April-June period. Corporate junk-bond defaults so far this year
total nearly $10 billion, or already about $1 billion more than all
of last year.
   Those junk-bond defaults don't give a full picture of the
tenuous financial substructure of American industry. A further
examination, which Wright Investors Service undertook, suggests the
direction of corporate financing:
   - Nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross
national product rose to 67 percent last year from 47 percent 20
years earlier, and 39 percent 30 years ago.
   - In the 20 years through 1989, the ratio of interest expense to
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent.
   - In the late 1980s, half of all funds raised by non-financial
corporations came from debt. As recently as the 1960s and 1970s,
the average was only 24 percent debt.
   All this debt, much of it from abroad, must be dealt with in the
1990s, and probably will be, because it cannot continue without
economic performance becoming ragged and eventually collapsing
under the burden of interest rates.
   But Americans should not believe the correction will occur
automatically or without pain as, to some extent, the buildup did.
   Simply stated, it will be repaid by such means as taxes and
inflation and relatively high interest costs, perhaps accompanied
by lessened wage increases and smaller productivity gains.
   It will be repaid by individuals, not by businesses or
governments, for the latter are just collections of individuals
running the machinery that processes the bills.

   Soaring oil prices are pushing ailing airlines
toward their biggest losses ever, and they might become a catalyst
for a severe shakeup of the troubled industry, analysts say.
   Coupled with the sluggish economy, the fallout from the Persian
Gulf crisis will hurt all airlines. But it might eventually end up
helping the stronger carriers get bigger at the expense of their
struggling competitors.
   ``It'll make the financially weaker guys get weaker faster,''
said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. The strong
airlines would then grow by default.
   Under such a scenario, analysts say, the winners who stand to
gain market share could be American, Delta and United. Losers will
likely include Eastern, Continental, Midway, Pan Am and Trans
World, the analysts say.
   Unless something puts the brakes on oil prices and the domestic
economy finds a quick fix, analysts anticipate that the airline
industry will lose $1 billion to $2 billion for 1990. That would
surpass 1982's record operating loss of $700 million.
   It will be ``decidedly ugly,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst
with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``The fundamental problem that the industry faces is excess
domestic capacity: Too many seats chasing too few people,''
Buttrick said. He sees the failure of some carriers, and the
removal of their assets from the market, as the best way to restore
equilibrium to the glutted market.
   The gloomy business climate might ``push one or two over the
brink,'' said analyst Raymond E. Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc.
``Eastern is probably the most endangered airline. Pan Am is facing
problems.''
   Murphy and Buttrick predict Eastern will die, with Murphy
putting the carrier's doomsday at around the end of the year and at
the latest in about 200 days.
   ``I figure they've got $300 million, and they're losing money at
the rate of a million and a half a day,'' despite efforts to
reorganize in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, he said.
   Others say Eastern might live longer than the doubters are
predicting.
   ``One has to remember that people have been spelling the death
knell for Pan Am and Eastern for a decade or more, and they're
still here,'' said George James, president of Airline Economics
Inc., a Washington consulting firm. ``It takes a long time for the
assets of a big carrier to be used up.''
   The immediate troubles of the industry were underscored last
week when Pan Am announced it would cut 2,500 jobs by mid October
and reduce its capacity by 7.5 percent during 1991.
   The moves come after the troubled carrier has sold assets and
found no immediate success in finding a merger partner.
   Neidl said the cutbacks, intended to save tens of millions of
dollars, will probably buy time for Pan Am. But there is no
guarantee the plan will work.
   ``It may get them through another slow winter period,'' Neidl
said. ``That would get them into the high summer season. It would
get them more time to look for an outside source for that capital
infusion they need.''
   Shortly after Pan Am announced plans to shrink to what it hopes
will be a profitable size, an aide to debt-plagued developer Donald
J. Trump said Trump had missed a payment of $1.1 million on the
Trump Shuttle. Trump is asking bankers to let him delay future
payments and saying that the high cost of jet fuel is causing his
problems.
   Analysts agree that the rising fuel costs are the biggest threat
to airlines these days. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, jet
fuel has gone up about 50 percent.
   If oil prices don't fall, airlines could end up paying up to $6
billion a year in extra fuel costs, according to industry
statisticians.
   Airlines responded to the inflated costs with two rounds of fare
hikes that come to about 10 percent on domestic flights, not nearly
enough to offset the higher fuel tab. But it took them about two
months after the invasion to set the higher fares into effect,
because no airline wants to go out on a limb with higher prices.
   In the meantime, airlines lost money as travelers flew for the
old rate on planes that were using the expensive fuel.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Plague Retailing Stocks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>

   As the traditional peak season of the year for
consumer spending approaches, Wall Street is decidedly un-bullish
on retailing.
   The stocks of most of the nation's major store operators have
fallen sharply since midsummer, posting losses as big as or bigger
than the decline in the market as a whole.
   Even as the early flood-tide of Christmas catalogs has reached
the nation's mailboxes, the retailing business is confronted with
recession fears, soaring oil prices and surveys showing little
enthusiasm among the nation's shoppers.
   ``Falling consumer confidence presents a troubling outlook for
fourth-quarter consumer spending,'' said Anthony Vignola at the
investment firm of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``This trend could be particularly damaging to the important
Christmas selling season and the demand by retailers for seasonal
supplies.''
   The primary catalyst for the selloff in retailing stocks, of
course, was Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the upsurge in oil
prices that followed.
   Analysts saw the increase in energy costs as the functional
equivalent of a tax increase, crimping consumers' disposable
income. Regular surveys by economists designed to measure consumer
confidence seem to bear out that view.
   Some observers point out that the outlook for retailers was
already worsening appreciably before the crisis in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``The latest numbers simply extend the downward trend in
year-over-year sales gains that has been under way since early in
1989,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York.
   ``Aggregate demand appeared to be on a progressively slowing
path even before the Mideast crisis. Now heightened consumer
anxiety, reflected in polls showing a majority of respondents
expects recession, threatens to become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.''
   All this helps explain why the stock of Sears Roebuck, a
prominent general merchandise retailer, traded last week around
$27, down from $48 in 1989.
   The Limited, a widely followed specialty retailer, slipped below
$15, against $25.62 just a few months earlier, adjusted for splits.
   Even Wal-Mart Stores, revered on Wall Street as one of the
nation's great growth companies, has traded of late at around
$26.50, down more than 25 percent from its recent record high of
$36.75, again adjusted for splits.
   At these ``discount'' prices, some bargain-minded investors are
naturally scrutinizing retail stocks. But many analysts still take
a wary view of the group.
   ``We don't believe the retail environment will improve until the
second half of 1991,'' wrote Barry Bryant, who follows the industry
for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``We believe a mild recession will begin in the fourth quarter
of 1990 and continue into the second quarter of 1991. We expect
retail sales to grow only 4 percent to 5 percent, and to be flat
when adjusted for inflation.
   ``The slower growth is expected to occur during a period when
retailers will be facing their most difficult sales and earnings
comparisons.''
   At the Value Line Investment Survey, analysts also are
recommending a go-slow approach to retailing issues.
   The firm acknowledges that big-name stocks in the industry like
Sears, K mart and J.C. Penney have lately been sporting dividend
yields in the neighborhood of 6 percent.
   ``Even though the dividend offers some downside protection for
those equities, we're not recommending purchase just yet,'' said
Value Line's Bart Schneider in the firm's latest quarterly report
on the group.
   ``Near-term prospects for the retail industry are unsettled and
it appears that conditions will probably get worse before they get
better.''

<HEAD>Gerber to Market Adult-Oriented Juice</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gerber Products Co. executive Al
Bolles tasted the bitter adult-oriented fruit drink offered at a
trade show, he was sure his company could do it better.
   Bolles, director of product development for the baby-food
company, picked up samples of the drink, Fibe-mini, at a trade show
in Japan. The fiber-containing drink was destined for the palates
of adult Asians.
   ``Nobody liked it,'' Bolles said of the tastes of Fibe-mini he
gave to other Gerber executives. ``I said, `We can make something
better than this.''
   The result, two years later, was Juice &amp; More, the first adult
product put out by the baby face-trademarked company. The target
market for fiber-enriched Juice &amp; More will be people concerned
about cholesterol and heart disease.
   ``It will be the beachhead of our marketing efforts to older
individuals,'' Gerber Chairman Al Piergallini said. ``This is all
new territory for us.''
   Juice &amp; More is to hit the shelves this week in 7,200 stores in
Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina,
Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New
York City and Washington D.C. Gerber hopes to bring the product to
the rest of the country, by spring.
   Gerber has looked into adult foods before - frozen dinners for
singles, ketchup, peanut butter and other products - but no project
has made it this far.
   Laboratory researchers concocted 200 products over about four
months combining juice with various kinds of fiber before they hit
on a formula they thought was a winner. Juice &amp; More uses apple
pectin and acadia plants as the sources for its fiber. The formula
would give a person as much fiber as two bowls of oatmeal in an
8-ounce glass.
   But, ``taste was the key,'' Gerber Director of Nutrition Dick
Cotter said. ``This had it.''
   The next test comes at the checkout counter, where Gerber
officials said they hope the juice will bring in $25 million in the
next two years.
   Analysts aren't sure.
   ``I'm optimistic about Gerber, but I'm skeptical about this
particular product,'' said John McMillin, who follows the food
industry to Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   Martin Friedman, editor of Gorman's New Product News, said less
than 1 percent of new products put on the consumer market will
survive.
   ``But there's a tremendous pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
if they come out with the right item,'' he said.
   Gerber posted a record $94.1 million in profits in the fiscal
year ended March 31. It had revenues of $1.1 billion and wants to
keep pushing those figures up.
   Introducing a fiber-enriched juice, let alone one for adults in
a company whose whole existence has been based on babies, is a
chance.
   ``If you're going to grow, you innovate,'' Piergallini said.
``When you innovate, there's risk.''

<HEAD>CAW Members Ratify Ford Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Auto Workers union members
overwhelmingly approved a new contract with Ford Motor Co.'s Canada
subsidiary, ending a nine-day strike that officials said threatened
production at U.S. plants.
   About 91 percent of the 12,800 members voting cast ballots in
favor of the new three-year pact, union officials said Sunday.
   The strike, which started Sept. 15, idled Ford's nine Canadian
plants, all in Ontario. Production at Ford's U.S. plants, some of
which rely on Canadian components, had been threatened by the
strike, company officials said.
   Assembly line workers were expected to return to work today.
Some workers were expected back on the job Sunday night to set up
equipment for production, said CAW President Robert White.
   The contract provides for a 7.5 percent increase in wages in the
first year, 6.7 percent in the second and 4.8 percent in the third.
   That means workers now earning the base rate of $17.83 an hour
will get $21.41 by the end of the contract.
   Workers also will get three extra days off a year, which will be
scheduled to give them four-day weekends. That will give Ford
workers nine four-day work weeks a year, once statutory holidays
are taken into account.
   Among other benefits: one year's notice of any workplace
closing; six month's notice of any job loss as a result of
technological change; special programs to pay workers who take
early retirement; and income supplements of up to three years for
workers who lose their jobs.
   The deal with Ford clears the way for the union to negotiate
contracts with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
   The union picked Ford as its strike target following separate
preliminary talks with GM and Chrysler.
   As in the past, the contract is expected to form the basis for
agreements with the other two companies.
   GM and the United Auto Workers averted a strike and reached a
tentative agreement last week on a three-year contract covering
300,000 workers in 29 states.
   That agreement, which is likely to be ratified, was reported to
include a 3 percent raise the first year, 3 percent lump-sum
payments the next two and retention of a requirement that GM hire
one worker for every two who quit, retire or die before retirement.
   Once the GM contract is ratified, the UAW will seek to negotiate
similar contracts with Ford and Chrysler in the United States.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, stepping up efforts
to gather support in the campaign against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, is getting encouragement from the two largest
international lending agencies.
   Top finance ministers participating in a series of weekend
meetings expressed their general support for a U.S.-led initiative
to get the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to devote
significant resources to cushioning the economic shock from the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   A formal endorsement of the aid effort was expected to come
today following the conclusion of closed-door meetings of the IMF's
policy-setting interim committee.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major told reporters
Sunday that the question of whether to provide aid was not at
issue. But he said details of the exact amount and which countries
to help remained to be worked out.
   The United States, concerned that the economic embargo against
Iraq could crumble without assistance to countries hurt by the
trade ban, has been pushing for more than $10 billion in aid to the
so-called front line states of Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
   It also is seeking billions of dollars in additional
contributions to a host of countries ranging from emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe to such Third World nations as the
Philippines, India and Brazil to offset the adverse effects on
their economies from higher oil prices.
   The world's seven richest industrial countries - the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -
provided an initial endorsement for Persian Gulf assistance
following a day-long meeting Saturday. The rich countries took note
of the double risks of inflation and recession imposed by the
doubling of world oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   All of the discussions were being held as part of the annual
meetings of the 152-nation IMF and its sister organization, the
World Bank.
   Those sessions have gained new urgency as finance officials
struggle to come up with strategies to keep the global economy from
tumbling into a recession as a result of the Persian Gulf turmoil.
President Bush was to address the delegates on Tuesday.
   Representatives for India and Brazil made special appeals for
assistance during Sunday's closed-door meetings, according to
participants in the sessions.
   Brazilian Finance Minister Zelia Maria Cardoso de Mello said
that even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices
skyrocketing, global growth had weakened considerably.
   ``The gulf crisis changed this already bleak picture
dramatically for the worse,'' she said in a statement released to
reporters. ``The moment calls for unprecedented efforts at
cooperation and strong support from the multilateral financial
institutions.''
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he believed the
IMF and the World Bank had an ``extremely critical'' role to play
in coordinating the assistance efforts being mounted to respond to
the Mideast crisis.
   After some initial criticism, Japan has come up with offers of
$4 billion in aid with half that amount earmarked for support of
the military effort and the other half going to provide economic
assistance to the front line states.
   IMF and World Bank officials have indicated that part of the aid
will come from voluntary contributions from oil-producing countries
that are reaping a windfall from the jump in oil prices. A meeting
of prospective donor nations is scheduled for Wednesday.
   In addition to the Persian Gulf crisis and traditional concerns
of alleviating poverty in the Third World, this year's meetings
were reviewing the economic crisis facing the Soviet Union.
   The seven rich countries heard a special report Saturday from
IMF and other officials on a study being conducted into the
problems besetting the Soviet economy.
   That study, which was ordered by Bush and other leaders at this
year's economic summit in July, could set the stage when it is
completed in December for billions of dollars in direct Western aid
to support Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's faltering efforts
to move his country to a free-market economy.
   For the first time in the history of the IMF and World Bank, the
Soviets are attending this year's annual meeting as special guests,
a first step that could led to eventual membership for the Soviet
Union in both agencies.
   Meanwhile, Romania became the 138th member of the International
Finance Corp. on Sunday, signaling a quest for private enterprise
in a formerly communist-ruled country where all major businesses
still are run by the state. The IFC, affiliated with the World
Bank, finances and aids in the development of private enterprise in
developing countries.

   Newmont Australia Ltd. and BHP Gold
Mines Ltd. said Monday they plan to merge, creating a gold-mining
company with expected market capitalization of more than $830
million.
   In joint statements, the companies said Newmont will offer one
ordinary share for every two BHP Gold shares.
   The resulting company would produce about 750,000 ounces of gold
in 1991.
   The announcement comes after Newmont Australia launched court
proceedings against a takeover bid from Poseidon Gold Ltd.
   The Newmont-BHP Gold merger is conditional on 51 percent
acceptance, regulatory approval and an increase in Newmont's
authorized share capital.
   BHP Gold is 56 percent owned by BHP Co. Ltd., Australia's
largest company.

<HEAD>Approves Sale of Two State Airlines, Competition in
Telecommunications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Labor Party on Monday
approved sweeping policy changes that pave the way for competition
in telecommunications and the sale of the two state airlines.
   The issue of privatization had threatened to split the party,
which officially had opposed any efforts to sell off
government-owned enterprises.
   The most divisive issue, particularly among unions, has been
telecommunications. A number of foreign companies have expressed
interest in entering the Australian communications market.
   Delegates at a special party conference voted 58-43 on Monday to
reject an amendment that would have prevented a private competitor
being established in full network competition to a merger of
domestic carrier Telecom and overseas carrier OTC.
   The conference then passed, on voice vote, a resolution allowing
the merger of Telecom and OTC, the sale of the government's
financially troubled satellite company Aussat and full private
competition.
   Later in the day, the conference endorsed the government's plan
to sell up to 49 percent of Qantas and all of Australian Airlines.
   The conference rejected a proposed amendment which would have
merged the airlines and kept them under full government control.
   Treasurer Paul Keating labeled the amendment as ``horrible'' and
rejected claims that the government deliberately starved the
airlines of funding so it could argue for their sale.
   Transport and Communications Minister Kim Beazley accepted an
amendment that limits to 35 percent the amount of Qantas which
could be sold to foreign interests.

<HEAD>US Underwrites War Insurance For First Ship In Commercial Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has underwritten war risk
insurance on a commercial ship engaged in normal commercial trade
for the first time since the Korean War in the early 1950s, the
shipping daily Lloyd's List reported Monday.
   In a front-page story, Lloyd's said the 40,921-ton Stonewall
Jackson owned by Waterman Steamship is the first vessel operating
commercially to take advantage of the U.S. government's standby war
risk insurance program since it became effective Aug. 29.
   The LASH barge carrier, which is about to make a call at the
Jordanian port of Aqaba, received war risk insurance from the U.S.
Maritime Administration on the hull and the 89 barges she carries,
the paper said.
   Under the program, any foreign or U.S. ship may apply to the
Maritime Administration for war risk coverage provided the vessel
is engaged in U.S. trade. The maritime agency is permitted to quote
rates when the rates and conditions being offered in the commercial
insurance market are considered unfair and unreasonable, the paper
said.
   The Maritime Administration has already issued war risk policies
for 30 of the merchant vessels taken by the U.S. Military Sealift
Command for operation Desert Shield in the Gulf, Lloyd's List said.
It has issued its own policies and any claims will be paid by the
U.S. Department of Defense.
   But the Stonewall Jackson was the first merchant ship operating
commercially to take advantage of the program, the paper said.
   The Stonewall Jackson was on a voyage from the United States to
the Far East via the Suez Canal when part of her cargo consigned to
Catholic Relief Services in India was diverted for the
international relief effort in Jordan, it said.
   Waterman Steamship approached the Maritime Administration for a
war risks quote for stopping at Aqaba, which is in a rated war
risks area, it said.
   Market rates for hull risks to Aqaba are currently around 0.25
percent, Lloyd's List said.
   A U.S. government source quoted by the paper said the Maritime
Administration has to quote lower rates for the program to work and
the commercial insurance market ``is not very happy with us''
because they see the administration as a potential competitor.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt decided on Monday to increase its
export oil prices by $3 a barrel for all blends, an Oil Ministry
official said.
   This was the third increase in eight days, reflecting a steady
rise in world oil prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Hammad Ayoub, head of the ministry's foreign sales, said the new
prices were $37.30 a barrel for the Khalig el-Zeit and Ras el-Bihar
blend; $37 a barrel for the Gulf of Suez; $36.15 a barrel for
Belayim; $35 a barrel for Ras Badran, and $34.70 a barrel for Ras
Ghareb.
   The increase took effect Monday and would prevail until the next
price review, he said.
   Egypt, not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, previously reviewed its export prices every two weeks.
Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the governmnet has
reviewed its prices more frequently.
   Egypt produces 870,000-900,000 barrels of oil daily. It exports
almost half the output and consumes the rest locally.

   Soviet lawmakers voted overwhelmingly today to
forsake seven decades of Communist economics, endorsing a rescue
plan to create a free market system from the failed machinery of
centralized planning.
   The Supreme Soviet also gave President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
sweeping new powers to implement the reforms unilaterally.
   But the lawmakers continued to disagree on which of several
competing economic blueprints for accomplishing the switch should
be followed.
   After a confusing and tumultuous debate, the Supreme Soviet
settled on a resolution calling for a committee of legislators and
economists appointed by Gorbachev to merge the various recipes into
a unified plan by Oct. 15. The vote was 323-11, with 56
abstentions.
   Although differences remained, it was the first time the Supreme
Soviet had committed the country to switching to a market economy
in hopes of ending chronic shortages of everything from housing to
bread and arresting inflation and a soaring budget deficit.
   When the resolution was approved, there was no applause or other
display of emotion, not even by Gorbachev, sitting alone on a
raised stage in a marble Kremlin meeting hall.
   Hours later the parliament approved 305-46, with 41 abstentions,
Gorbachev's request for broad emergency poers to carry out
reforms. It gave him the authority until March 1992 to bypass
step-by-step legislative scrutiny and issue decrees on property,
management of the economy, the budget and law and order.
   The legislature would have the power to recommend Gorbachev
cancel or modify the decrees, which the president said he would
begin issuing soon.
   Several lawmakers feared they were giving Gorbachev too much
power, and one said it would make him a ``monarch.''
   But in an animated 15-minute speech, Gorbachev vowed to exercise
his new powers with ``full responsibility.''
   ``It's a responsibility. It's not a tea party,'' he said.
   The adopted resolution endorses a compromise program backed by
Gorbachev, but calls for incorporating a more conservative recipe
of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Lawmakers later agreed they should also try to include parts of
a more radical plan approved by the Russian Federation, the largest
of the 15 Soviet republics, led by Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin is Gorbachev's chief political rival, and his parliament
has set the pace on reforming an economy so inefficient that crops
spoil on their way to market and plants stand idle for lack of
spare parts.
   ``We can and must come out with a single program for switching
to a market economy,'' Gorbachev said. He said the goal is
``maximum accord in society and not confrontation.''
   Ryzhkov, facing mounting calls for his resignation, said the
vote left ``no victors and no defeated.''
   ``This is a compromise,'' he said in an interview.
   Sergei Stankevich, Moscow's deputy mayor and a national
legislator, said Gorbachev's insistence on unifying the competing
programs would lead ``not to consolidation but to collapse.''
   Consumer shortages are widespread and worsening, most recently
including bread, and there is fear of economic collapse.
   Gorbachev's program would reverse the direction that the Soviet
Union has taken since the Bolshevik Revolution, especially Stalin's
forced collectivization, which claimed the lives of some 7 million
people.
   It would create a federation of republics with economies built
on private businesses, individually owned farms and stock markets
trading shares in competitive companies.
   The program marks a significant change in Gorbachev's tactics.
His perestroika program had been aimed at ``restructuring''
centralized socialism, but now is apparently moving toward
destroying it.
   Lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Friday, but failed to
muster a quorum and had to adjourn until today. Gorbachev expressed
frustration at the time, saying there was no more time to ``talk,
think, try and experiment.''
   Several participants in today's debate proposed that the
national legislature shun the attempt at a compromise and endorse
instead the most radical reform plan under consideration - that of
economist Stanislav Shatalin.
   ``There can be no compromise between the programs of the
government, the president and the Shatalin group,'' the 56-year-old
Shatalin told the legislature.
   Outside the Kremlin, protesters gathered to express
disappointment in Gorbachev's handling of the economic crisis.
Dozens of sign-carrying protesters chanted slogans at legislators
as they arrived for the morning debate.
   ``The people don't trust Gorbachev,'' about a dozen
demonstrators shouted outside the Kremlin's Spassky Gate.
   They held signs that read ``A president - not an emperor'' and
``All decrees of the president are battles against democracy.''
   Ryzhkov, who has become a lightning rod for the growing public
unrest, predicted on Soviet television Sunday night that the move
to a market economy will take years, not 500 days.
   He confirmed ``very serious'' problems in bringing this year's
bumper harvest to market. He said at most only one-third of crops
have so far been harvested.

<HEAD>Share Price Falls to Three-Year Low</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollars are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of media giant News Corp.'s
shares plunged Monday to a three-year low and the company
threatened to delist from the Australian Stock Exchange.
   The company's share price fell 70 Australian cents, or 58 cents
(U.S.), to 8.90 Australian dollars, or $7.39, in morning trading
before recovering slightly to close the session at 9.00 Australian
dollars, or $7.47.
   The stock last traded below 9.00 Australian dollars in November
1987.
   News Corp. exeutives were not available for comment on the
decline.
   Monday's price drop wiped another 161.14 million Australian
dollars, or $133.75 million, off the company's market value, which
lost 228.28 million Australian dollars, or $189.47 million, on
trading on Friday.
   News Corp. told its shareholders in a mailing sent this wek
that it would shift its home base offshore if the Australian Stock
Exchange failed to change rules which prevent companies from
issuing limited voting shares.
   The company, which is headed by Rupert Murdoch and has
significant newspaper, magazine and television interests in the
Britain and the United States as well as in Australia, said it
planned to change its capital structure by altering its articles of
association to allow the issue of participating preference shares
and non-voting shares.
   Analysts said the threat to move offshore contributed to the
uncertainty surrounding the company, but said Monday's price
decline also reflected weakness in the broader market for media
stocks.
   ``Basically, News Corp. is at the sharp end of the ship,'' said
BZW Australia Ltd. senior analyst George Sutton. ``The wave of
recession usually breaks over media companies before it does over
others.''
   Sutton said the company three major markets - Australia, Britain
and the United States - were all experiencing difficult economic
times.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Kuwait Investment Office saying sale was
investment decision, not a move to raise cash.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kuwaiti government's investment arm on Monday
made its first known sale of a Kuwaiti holding since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The sale was ``purely an investment decision'' and wasn't aimed
at raising cash, said a spokeswoman for the London-based investment
arm, the Kuwait Investment Office. She wasn't identified, in
accordance with British practice.
   The investment office sold a 10.1 percent stake in Mount
Charlotte Investments PLC to a company controlled by New Zealand
financier Ron Brierley for $121 million, Brierley's company said.
   The Kuwait Investment Office has a massive portfolio worth up to
an estimated $100 billion and includes major stakes in British,
West German and Spanish companies.
   On Friday, Kuwait's finance minister, Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, said
at a London news conference that Kuwait was managing to make do
with its liquid assets and if any asset sale was required, ``We can
handle it with the cooperation of central banks in an orderly and
responsible manner.''
   Governments have frozen Kuwait's assets to protect them from
Iraq but Al-Sabah said the governments have allowed exiled Kuwaiti
institutions to operate ``as freely as prudent.''
   Brierley Investments Ltd. said it paid $1.36 per share for the
88.8 million shares of Mount Charlotte owned by the Kuwait
investment office.
   The purchase lifted Brierley Investment's Mount Charlotte stake
to 39.9 percent and forced the company under British takeover rules
to make a bid for all of Mount Charlotte.
   Its offer values all of Mount Charlotte at $1.2 billion.
   A Mount Charlotte spokeswoman, who wasn't identified in
accordance with British practice, said the company's board of
directors would hold an emergency meeting.
   Mount Charlotte, which owns and operates 100 hotels, had
after-tax profit of $72 million on sales of $289 million last year.
   Brierley Investments, quoted on the London, New Zealand and
Australian stock markets, is an investment company with holdings in
a diverse range of industries and markets.
   Brierley has a wide range of stakes in British companies,
including a 20 percent holding in Vickers PLC, which makes
Rolls-Royce luxury cars.
   It first became a shareholder in Mount Charlotte in the spring
of 1988.
   Brierley had an after tax profit of $226 million on revenue of
$3.8 billion in the year ended June 30, 1989.

   Stock prices dropped sharply today in activity
marked by heavy selling of the battered bank issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 49.26 points to
2,463.12 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. That drove the average below
the 13-month closing low of 2,483.42 it reached on Aug. 23.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 203 up, 1,212 down
and 320 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.98 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said investors were bracing for more bad tidings from
the banking industry after Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement
Friday of a dividend cut, new reserves for loan losses, and a staff
reduction of 5,000 jobs.
   The news by itself did not come as any great surprise to Wall
Street, which was well aware of widespread credit problems facing
the banks.
   Nevertheless, it evidently served to intensify the recession
worries that have been depressing stock prices since midsummer.
   Brokers noted that the market also had to contend with further
increases in world oil prices. Crude oil futures for November
delivery surpassed $37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Chase Manhattan stock fell 1| to 11&lsqb; as the most active NYSE
issue. Among other leading money-center bank issues, Citicorp
dropped 1&rsqb; to 14&rsqb;; Chemical Banking 2 to 15; Manufacturers Hanover
1&rsqb; to 21|, and J.P. Morgan 1 to 31&lsqb;.
   Manufacturers Hanover, which recently declared a regular
quarterly dividend, said it expected to be able to keep the payout
at that rate.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Boeing, down 3{
at 39}; General Electric, down 1&lsqb; at 54}; Philip Morris, down 1&lsqb; at
43|, and International Business Machines, down 1~ at 104~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.19 to 167.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.44 at 313.57.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Dip On Lack Of Frost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Corn and soybean futures prices opened slightly
lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a lack
of significant frost damage to those crops over the weekend. Wheat
futures were narrowly mixed.
   Freezing temperatures were concentrated in the northwest corner
of the Corn Belt but there was little damage to the crops.
   Forecasts call for a warming trend and scant rain in the Corn
Belt this week, which should push late-planted crops toward
maturity and allow harvesting to progress.
   Analysts said the early losses were limited by buying linked to
strength in the energy and precious metals markets and weakness in
the stock market in reaction to warlike rhetoric from Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1 cent

<HEAD>Bush Likely to Veto Any Delay in Budget Deal Deadline</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: TOPS with 16 grafs to include Fitzwater comments. Picks up 3rd

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House today warned Congress that
efforts to put off next Monday's deadline for $100 billion in
automatic spending cuts likely will be met with a presidential
veto.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Gramm-Rudman
law targets, which require the automatic cuts in the absence of
congressional agreement on deficit-reduction, ``are an important
discipline.''
   ``They were put there by Congress to enforce decision-making and
we don't agree they should be extended,'' he said.
   Asked if that was a clear veto threat for efforts to delay the
spending cuts to give budget negotiators some additional breathing
room, Fitzwater said: ``A veto threat is a veto threat. I conclude
it's a veto threat.''
   Fitzwater noted that the administration in the past has
suggested that President Bush was likely to veto stopgap funding
legislation that would delay or reduce the deficit targets.
   However, today's strong renewal of the threat - coming just
seven days before the deadline and as budget talks remained
deadlocked - appeared calculated to increase pressure on the
bargaining process.
   ``There are a number of things that still divide us. We're still
hopeful we can get agreement. We've got seven days to go. We're
t-minus seven... We're sticking with it and still talking,'' he
said.
   Fitzwater also was critical of what he called efforts by
Democrats to suggest that the major stumbling block was
administration insistence on a cut in the capital gains tax.
   ``The Democrats have been able to focus attention on the capital
gains provision to the overall detriment of the progress of the
negotiations,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said there were other important areas of disagreement.
``We're not even close on the spending cut side,'' Fitzwater said.
   Support in Congress has grown, as next Monday's deadline
approaches, for a temporary measure to delay the targets until
later in October. But Fitzwater made it clear the administration
wasn't interested in such a postponement at this time.
   The spokesman said that Bush would join the budget negotiations,
but probably not ``until pretty close to the end. When it's
necessary, we'll be there.''
   As to a new proposal by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
for a package that would offset a cut in capital gains taxes with
higher taxes on the wealthy, Fitzwater said:
   ``We certainly share his frustration that everybody needs to get
off the dime and get an agreement here.''
   However, Fitzwater would not comment on the specific proposal.
   The Kansas Republican said GOP negotiators at the 4-month-old
budget talks were resisting Democratic efforts to raise the income
tax rate for the wealthiest Americans from 28 percent to 33
percent.
   Dole's remarks made it clear that Republicans are searching for
ways to keep the capital gains tax reduction - a favorite proposal
of President Bush - alive at the budget talks. Bargainers have said
contention over capital gains is the major obstruction to a final
budget deal.
   Democrats have said Republicans must either abandon the proposal
or be prepared to also accept higher levies on the wealthy, who
Democrats say would gain the most from a lowered capital gains tax.
The levy is imposed on sales of property.
   ``We're looking at ways to ... increase taxes on upper income in
a way that will, in effect, maybe pierce this so-called bubble, but
maybe not go clear to 33 percent,'' Dole said Sunday on CBS TV's
``Face the Nation'' program.
   The ``bubble'' is used to describe the portion of the income tax
structure that imposes a 28 percent rate on the wealthiest
Americans but a 33 percent rate on those with slightly less income.
   It was unclear whether Dole was referring to actually increasing
the rates for the richest taxpayers. During the budget
negotiations, Republicans have offered to eliminate certain
deductions for top-bracket taxpayers, which they have argued would
in effect raise those rates without actually doing so.
   Dole's comments came before Bush administration officials and
congressional leaders met for four hours in a private room at the
Capitol in an effort to work out a budget deal.
   ``They talked about everything,'' said an official who asked to
not be identified.
   The bargainers planned to meet again today and resume their
effort to work out a five-year, $500 billion package of spending
cuts and tax increases.
   On the same television program, Senate Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell blamed the Bush administration for the glacial pace at
which the talks have so far progressed.
   ``If this were a negotiation just among ... the congressional
leadership, we would have had an agreement a couple of weeks ago,''
said the Maine Democrat. ``The problem is the administration's
position and its dominant role in the discussions and its
insistence upon its way.''
   Dole also seemed vexed by the administration's pace during the
talks.
   ``We shouldn't be in too much of a rush,'' Dole said
administration officials have told him. ``Well, I don't know what
else they've got to do this year, but I've got a lot of things I'd
like to do.''
   The negotiators expect a pressure-filled week.
   The new fiscal year begins a week from today. The Gramm-Rudman
law will automatically cut federal spending by $85 billion on Oct.
1 unless a deal is reached or lawmakers decide to postpone the
slashes.

<HEAD>Senate Debates Bill to Drive Gas Guzzlers Off Road</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with beginning of debate; picks

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate took up legislation today aimed at
driving gas guzzlers off the road, with sponsors of a tougher fuel
economy bill rejecting industry claims that the measure would make
them produce only small cars.
   ``We can reach the goals without downsizing cars,'' declared
Sen. Slade Gordon, R-Wash., one of the bill's sponsors.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., another sponsor, read statements by
auto industry executives in the early 1970s predicting the demise
of the family sedan as a result of fuel efficiency requirements
then under consideration.
   ``That just didn't happen. The six-passenger vehicle is here
just as it was before,'' said Bryan. The fuel economy measures were
put into effect and average mileage for cars increased from 14 mpg
to about 28 mpg over the last 15 years.
   The bill before the Senate would require the average fuel
economy of cars to go to about 35 mpg over the next five years and
to 40 mpg by the year 2001, saving millions of barrels of oil a
year.
   The Senate debate comes at automakers prepare to roll out their
1991 cars, including many models that emphasize comfort and
performance, instead of fuel economy. Industry lobbyists contend
the only way to achieve the fuel economy goals of the Senate bill
would be to dramatically reduce the size and weight of cars.
   Sen.Donald Riegle, D-Mich., hoped to head off a vote later in
the week on the legislation either by saddling it with amendments
or garnering enough opposition so supporters cannot get the
required 60 votes to end debate.
   A vote to cut off debate and bring the matter to a vote could
come as early as Tuesday.
   The Mideast crisis that caused soaring oil prices and the threat
of future gasoline lines has given the legislation new momentum.
Supporters claim the more fuel efficient cars eventually could save
the country 2.8 million barrels of oil a day.
   But auto industry lobbyists contend the kinds of fuel efficiency
increases being talked about on Capitol Hill are not economically
feasible.
   And in recent weeks, the automakers have stepped up their
campaign against fuel economy bills in both the House and Senate.
   ``If the bill were enacted into law we would have economic
disaster on our hands. Almost everything that is being built now
would be obsolete by the year 2001,'' maintains Thomas Hanna,
president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
   The Senate voted 68-28 last week to rebuff efforts by Riegle,
whose state is home to most of the U.S. auto industry, to keep the
auto fuel economy bill from getting to the Senate floor.
   ``The American people understand better now than they did
(before the Iraqi invasion) that we're very vulnerable in terms of
oil imports,'' Bryan said in a recent interview. ``There is a
recognition that we need to do something.''
   The automakers' cause gained a boost last week when the Bush
administration weighed in heavily against the Bryan bill.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called it ``unrealistic,
irresponsible and ... unattainable.''
   He said he was convinced it would prompt manufacturers to
dramatically reduce the size and weight of their cars - thereby
resulting in between 600 and 1,100 additional automobile fatalities
a year. He and Energy Secretary James Watkins have said they would
urge President Bush to veto the measure if it clears Congress.
   The legislation's supporters also have a sizeable hurdle to
overcome in the House, where any auto fuel economy bill normally
would have to go through the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has made no secret of his
distaste for the proposal.

<HEAD>CSX Receives Injunction to Stop Railroad Pickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Transportation Inc. won a temporary
injunction Monday to end a railroad workers' strike that stopped or
delayed as many as 400 trains in at least 10 states, a company
spokesman said.
   ``A temporary restraining order of 10 days duration has been
issued and the judge has instructed the pickets to come down
immediately,'' spokesman Lindsay Leckie said from the company's
Jacksonville, Fla., headquarters.
   The injunction was issued Monday morning by U.S. District Judge
Karl Forester in Lexington. A preliminary hearing was set for
Friday.
   The strike by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way began early
Monday at more than two dozen locations on the old Louisville &amp;
Nashville line between Chicago, New Orleans and Pensacola, Fla.,
Leckie said. The workers protested the company's refusal to
transport them away from their work sites for lunch.
   The picket lines were honored by hundreds of workers in other
craft unions, he said.
   As many as 400 of CSX's 1,300 trains either were stopped by the
strike or had to be operated by supervisory personnel, he said.
Leckie said he did not know how many trains were stopped.
   The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way represents workers who
maintain the railroad's tracks, bridges and signs.
   The union complaint was registered in eastern Kentucky, he said.
   Other states involved included Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee,
Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida, Leckie
said.
   ``The issue is that the labor organization is insisting that
employees be transported from the work site back to their lodging
facilities, either railroad camp cars or their hotels,,'' Leckie
said. ``Our contention is meals can and should be provided at the
work site itself.''
   Workers get from 30 minutes to an hour for lunch, but that could
stretch to three hours in some cases if transportation time was
added, he said. The issue has been settled in the company's favor
during arbitration in the past, Leckie said.

<HEAD>Delta Says Fuel Price Increases Will Put Dent in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines said Monday that its earnings for
the first quarter of its fiscal year will be down sharply due to
increased fuel prices that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Thomas J. Roeck Jr., Delta's senior vice president of finance,
said earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 would be
``significantly worse'' than those for same quarter last year, when
the airline posted record profits.
   Roeck said the airline is now paying 64 percent more for jet
fuel than it was before the Aug. 2 invasion. Delta has twice raised
domestic air fares, in August and again effective Oct. 1, to help
offset the fuel price increases.
   In the quarter ending Sept. 30, 1989, net earnings were $133.1
million, or $2.38 per share, on revenue of $2.17 billion. Roeck
noted that Delta was helped during that quarter by the strike
against rival Eastern Airlines.

<HEAD>OPEC Production Up More than 2 Million Barrels Per Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Total daily production of crude oil by OPEC members
has risen from 19.7 million barrels in August to 22 million barrels
now, an International Energy Agency official said.
   The watchdog agency, which represents 21 industrialized Western
countries, is scheduled to meet in Paris on Friday to assess the
impact of the Gulf confrontation on world oil supplies.
   The agency official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said Monday the crude oil supply situation hasn't changed
significantly since mid August.
   Given the estimated rise in OPEC output, the official said, the
situation in world oil markets was ``manageable, though not
comfortable.'' Oil companies have had to draw on stocks during a
period normally reserved for building up reserves ahead of the
high-demand winter season, he said.
   Demand among the members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, which includes all IEA members plus
France, Finland and Iceland, is estimated at 38.9 million barrels
per day in the fourth quarter, up from the previously reported
estimate of 37.8 million for the third quarter, the official said.
   Before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, OPEC was cutting
back to reach a quota target of 22.5 million barrels per day, the
official said.
   Following the subsequent boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude,
which took an estimated 4 million barrels of oil out of the market
each day, OPEC oil ministers agreed to temporarily suspend the
cartel's production quotas to allow its members to make up for the
shortfall.
   Now, the cartel appears well on its way to boosting production.
Saudi Arabia, with the largest available amount of surplus
capacity, has produced an average 7.3 million barrels a day in
September, up from a revised 5.6 million the month before.

<HEAD>Brazil Not Yet Ready to Negotiate New Coffee Price-Support
Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil is not ready to enter negotiations on new
international measures to regulate the world coffee market,
Brazilian officials said Monday.
   ``It is not the appropriate moment to start negotiations, but we
do not want to close the door on negotiations,'' said Celso Amorim,
a senior Brazilian foreign ministry official attending
Ifee Organization talks.
   Amorim and Joao Cunha of the Brazilian economics ministry are
heading their country's delegation to the talks here among the
coffee organization's 73 consumer and producer member countries.
   Brazil said more time was neednternational Cofed before a decision
was made on
negotiations for a new International Coffee Agreement with the
powers to regulate supplies and prices, Amorim said.
   The present pact's powers to do this - exercised through a
system of export quotas - were suspended in July 1989, following a
dispute among producers over export market share. The suspension
triggered a massive fall in world prices, which hit a 14-year low
late last year and have recovered only slightly since.
   The present coffee agreement expires on Sept. 30, 1991.
   Colombia, the world's second biggest producer, has called on the
coffee organization to decide this week what should happen then.
   The options are to extend the present administrative agreement,t the
voice to that spot, as if the
music were a character released into space.
   ``Touch with your sound, your word...let it get away from you,
see it, it's a vision.''
   Curtin says her daughter, Claudia, who's in her 20s, told her
she had used that idea to guide her horse over obstructions - by
throwing a precise mental image of the movement in front of her and
following it.
   To project the voice, the chest must be released out and up,
``the posture of anyone who has been successful,'' Curtin says.
Teaching that to students in the 1970s, as a professor at Yale
University, was nearly impossible, she says.
   ``To stand up straight meant that you were with all the
conservatives, and the warmongers, you were for big money,'' she
says. ``So everyone slunk down, the posture was really casual.''
   Curtin started teaching at Tanglewood 26 years ago at the peak
of a performing career that took her to the world's leading stages,
New York's Metropolitan, Milan's La Scala and the Vienna
Staatsoper.
   On teaching singers fiendishly difficult 20th century music,
Curtin quotes Olga Averino, the Russian-born soprano who was her
teacher:
   ``Darling, so simple,'' says the West Virginia native, speaking
with a heavy Slavic accent, ``It's just like teaching a rabbit how
to play a drum, you just do it over and over and over.''
   Curtin stopped performing at the age of 61, about a decade later
than most sopranos. By that time, she had been appointed dean of
the Boston University School for the Arts.
   The major problem with young singers today, she says, is that
they're often ``well-trained poodles,'' a ``homogenized product''
of coaches who tell them by rote what to do.
   Meanwhile, she tells her students, ``I want you to be smart, I
want you to be your own artist. I don't want you to be a dumb
musician.''
   The main quality of teaching is sharing, she says, quoting
Thornton Wilder's novel, ``The Ides of March,'' in which Caesar
tells Cleopatra that ``there's nothing so exhilarating as teaching
to a young and eager mind what it's taken you 20 years of drudgery
to discover.''
   When she's teaching, she says, ``the minute the music turns on,
somehow, my channels are open. The thing that is emotion, that is
music, is running through the center of my body and out, out, out.
   ``A masterful teacher turns out people who do it better than he
does. And I would like to be that.''
   She started practicing ``to be that'' at age 9 in West Virginia.
   ``I took dancing lessons and my very dearest friend did not,''
she says. ``So, I would come home from my lesson and teach it all
to her, and that was so much fun!''
   Almost six decades after that first attempt at teaching, her
former student, baritone Sanford Sylvan, says Curtin is his
``artistic mother...the wind beneath my wings.''

   The dollar fell against all the major currencies
in European trading today, hurt by perceptions that major
industrialized nations may let the U.S. currency decline further.
   Gold prices rose.
   The Group of Seven ministers issued a statement over the weekend
calling for continued firm monetary policies in the face of high
oil prices, which are stoking inflation.
   The statement also expressed contentment with recent movements
in currency values.
   The Tokyo markets were closed for Autumnal Equinox Day.
   In London, the dollar fell to a closing 135.57 Japanese yen from
137.33 yen at Friday's Tokyo close. The dollar fetched 136.30 yen
in early afternoon trading in New York.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8810 from $1.8465 late
Friday. A pound was quoted at $1.8805 in the early afternoon in New
York.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels, were: 1.5565 German marks, down from 1.5770; 1.2965 Swiss

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States dropped this week by five to 1,055, the oil
toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   A week ago, the widely watched index of drilling activity had
increased by 21 to total 1,060. The count a year ago was 967, Baker
Hughes said.
   The Houston-based company has kept track of the rig count since
1940. The count represents the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Texas added five rigs in the latest count, while Ohio's count
rose three. Louisiana's count was down five and Wyoming was down
three.

<TEXT>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British confectionary
and drinks company, said Monday it is in talks with the mineral
watrs concern Apollinaris Brunnen AG that could lead to a joint
venture between the two companies.
   The proposed venture is not expected to require any special
funding arrangements, and Cadbury Schweppes said the announcement
was being made to alert German trade unions, in keeping with normal
practices in that country.
   Apollinaris, the mineral water subsidiary of Germany's Brau und
Brunnen AG, has seven mineral water brands. four bottling plants
and sales pf nearly 300 million liters last year. Its premium
priced Apollinaris is the second most popular mineral water in
Germany.
   Cadbury Schweppes already has a footing in the German and
Austrian soft drink markets, with two bottling plants and combined
sales of 60 million liters last year.
   Elsewhere in Europe, Cadbury has made a significant move into
the French beverage market with its purchase in May of Perrier's
non-cola soft drinks business for 125 million pounds. In April,
Cadbury acquired NV Gibeco, the Gini drinks franchise for
Luxembourg and Belgium.

<HEAD>Australian Gold Companies to Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian gold mining giants BHP Gold Mines
Ltd. and Newmont Australia Ltd. said Monday they plan to merge.
   The surprise proposal, which could thwart Poseidon Gold Ltd.'s
hostile takeover for Newmont, values the three-year old BHP Gold at
475.3 million Australian dollars, or about $396.4 million.
   The merged company would take complete control of the Telfer
Gold Mine in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
   Newmont is offering one ordinary share for every two BHP Gold
shares. The offer is contingent upon 51 per cent acceptance and
Newmont shareholders approving an increase in authorized capital.
   The BHP Co. Ltd. currently holds 56 percent of BHP Gold, but its
effective stake in the merged entity would total 23 percent.
   While BHP is yet to announce its intentions under the merger
proposal, directors are expected to agree to the gold division
being subsumed just three years after its listing.
   BHP Gold chairman John Gough agreed that although BHP Gold would
hold four of the nine board seats, the managerial influence and
culture would stem from Newmont.
   Two major stumbling blocks remain with Newmont's largest
shareholders - the U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp. and Robert de
Crespigny's Poseidon Gold Ltd. with a rival bid on the table - yet
to announce their intentions.
   Newmont Mining, which once held more than 70 per cent of Newmont
and has been anxious to sell its remaining 25 per cent, has
consented to the increased capital base but firmly repeated its
intention not to give anyone control of more than 20 percent of its
local unit.
   In a brief statement, Newmont Mining directors said the company
would eventually sell its diluted 14 per cent stake ``in a manner
which would be the least disruptive to the market.''
   Poseidon Gold said its two-for-one share offer, which has been
stymied by legal action initiated by Newmont, was still open.
   In a joint statement, Newmont chairman Sir Brian Inglis and BP
Gold's Gough said the merger would result in a ``financially strong
gold mining house'' with ``enormous exploration potential'' and
forecast 1990-91 production of 750,000 ounces of gold.
   Gough said the merger had been under consideration at BHP Gold
since late last year when Newmont directors approached BHP Gold
with a tentative merger proposal after Newmont Mining indicated its
intention to sell.
   The proposal is subject to approval under the Foreign
Acquisitions and Takeovers Act and requires approvals from Newmont
shareholders, the boards of BHP Gold and BHP Co. Ltd.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis, Rising Costs, Revive Brazil's Alcohol Fuel Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has given
new life to Brazil's program to run its vehicles on pure sugar-cane
alcohol instead of gasoline.
   Shortages of the sugar-cane fuel, which has high production
costs, and an abundance of inexpensive foreign oil had turned
Brazilians off to alcohol.
   But as oil prices have risen beyond $34 a barrel as a result of
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, critics are taking another look one of
the world's leading alternative fuel programs, called Pro-Alcohol
here.
   ``The program is not finished,'' President Fernando Collor de
Mello told delegates attending a sugar-cane energy meeting shortly
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion. ``With the crisis in the gulf, the
strategic importance of Pro-Alcohol also increases.''
   General Motors and Autolatina, a production consortium that
includes Ford and Volkswagen, announced an immediate 11 percent
increase in production of cars able to run on alcohol fuel to meet
a rise in demand.
   ``The country was the victim of an optical illusion that oil
would be eternally cheap and plentiful,'' Julio Maria Borges,
production director of Copersucar, Brazil's largest alcohol
cooperative, said in an interview.
   The resurrection of Pro-Alcohol is good news for owners of
Brazil's 4.5 million alcohol cars - one-third of the nation's
vehicles - who believed the clean, weet-smelling fuel was the
energy of the future.
   The program began in response to the OPEC oil shock of 1973.
Brazil, which imported 80 percent of its petroleum, saw its oil
bill soar from $600 million to $2 billion in 1974, or one-fourth of
total imports.
   Alcohol seemed like the solution to dependency on foreign oil.
It's made from sugar cane, a renewable source that grows abundantly
here. And it fit in well with the ``national security'' concerns of
the military governments that ran Brazil from 1964-85.
   Few mentioned the risks. Alcohol was untested on a wide scale
anywhere in the world. It gave poor mileage and cost more than $40
a barrel to make.
   But Brazil, riding the euphoria of its fuel idea, was undaunted
at sinking billions of dollars in a longterm project.
   In 1975, its first year, Pro-Alcohol produced alcohol that mixed
with gasoline to make gasohol.
   In 1979, 2,271 cars were built and sold that ran solely on pure
alcohol.
   But there were bugs in the early models. They wouldn't start on
cold mornings, few in this mostly tropical country but not unknown
in the southeast, and the alcohol corroded metal carburators and
fuel tanks. Automakers eventually devised mini-gas tanks for cold
starts and anticorrosion coatings.
   To compensate for poor mileage, the government made alcohol 35
percent cheaper than gasoline and offered tax breaks on alcohol
cars. It promoted the program with the slogan, ``Alcohol cars:
someday you'll own one.''
   The response was overwhelming. Sales of the new cars rose to 38
percent of the market in 1982 and 88 percent the next year.
   In 1985, the peak for alcohol cars, 96 of every 100 cars sold
were alcohol-powered. Pumps bearing the green ``A'' for alcohol
sprouted in service stations across this country of 150 million
residents.
   But things began to go wrong for Pro-Alcohol.
   Oil prices leveled off, then fell. Alcohol, still $40 a barrel,
began to be too expensive.
   Worse, the government couldn't raise the pump price of alcohol
without also raising gasoline. The spiral of fuel prices helped
pushed annual inflation up to three digits, then four.
   Farmers, encouraged by subsidies, replaced food crops with sugar
cane. The government had to import food, adding to its $117 billion
foreign debt, highest in the developing world.
   In a final irony, Brazil discovered major offshore oil reserves
of its own. The country's foreign oil dependency fell under 50
percent.
   Critics claimed Brazil's net energy gain with alcohol was
negligible because trucks, tractors and harvesters on cane
plantations ran on cheap diesel fuel.
   ``I myself was a critic,'' Collor said. ``I shared doubts about
the high cost of production and deficiency of supply.''
   In 1989, high sugar prices on the international market led many
cane growers to make sugar instead of alcohol. Suddenly there
wasn't enough alcohol fuel.
   Long lines formed at service stations, and motorists pushing
alcohol cars that had run out of fuel became a common sight.
   Popular TV game-show host Fausto Silva poked fun at the
Pro-Alcohol slogan, joking on his weekly program, ``Alcohol cars:
someday you'll push one.''
   The government was forced to import alcohol. It cut the price
advantage of alcohol over gasoline to 25 percent, added gasoline to
alcohol, and reduced the alcohol content in gasohol in most cities.
   Only Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, kept a higher
alcohol mix to reduce air pollution. The cane fuel produces half
the carbon monoxide of gasoline and no harmful hydrocarbons.
   Sales of alcohol cars plummeted below 5 percent of the market in
July.
   Now, while alcohol has gotten a reprive because of the gulf
crisis, Jacy Mendonca, president of the National Auto Makers
Association, warned it might not be ``lasting or significant.''
   Added Borges of Copersucar: ``The problem is that diesel fuel is
very cheap - less than half the price of gasoline - and that's a
very strong incentive to use it in every vehicle you can.''
   Collor, who took office in March, abolished the government's
Sugar and Alcohol Institute, widely seen as inefficient and
corrupt. To guarantee the alcohol supply, cane producers must now
get government permission to export.
   Pro-Alcohol also will get funds for research to attain ``full
economic viability,'' he said.
   ``Society should have a positive view of Pro-Alcohol,'' Collor
said. ``It is a successful project that cannot be tampered with.''

<HEAD>Tourism to Holy Land Crippled by Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

   Most days, Abdel Raouf Abu Assab sits at the
door of his souvenir shop in Jerusalem's Old City, smoking his
water pipe and waiting for tourists.
   These days he waits in vain.
   ``Since the gulf crisis, there is almost no business at all,''
Abu Assab complained.
   Although Israel is hundreds of miles from the Persian Gulf, the
headlines created by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait have scared
away travelers from the Holy Land, government and industry
officials said.
   Some hotels in Arab east Jerusalem, largely dependent on
Christian visitors from the West, say 80 percent of their September
bookings were canceled. Hotel managers fear the traditional
Christmas traffic will be down sharply, too.
   In Jewish areas, it is more difficult to judge the impact of the
gulf crisis because foreigners are just beginning to arrive to
celebrate the ``High Holidays'' in Israel.
   Jerusalem's Hilton Hotel was fully booked for Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish new year, and for the eight-day Feast of the Tabernacles on
Oct. 4-11.
   Motti Verses, a spokesman for the hotel, said that ``after that,
we haven't suffered massive cancellations but, for sure, people are
hesitating to book.''
   Tel Aviv travel agent Harry Kalman said business travel was
continuing but that holiday business was suffering.
   ``We get Telexes every day from Germany, Holland, Denmark,''
Kalman said. ``They want to know if it is safe to come . . . There
have been a lot of cancellations.''
   Tourism is one of Israel's highest foreign exchange earners,
netting about $1.8 billion a year, the government says. Last year,
1.4 million tourists arrived, and the government had hoped for a
record 2 million this year.
   Those predictions now seem too optimistic.
   Moti Debi, director of Israel's Ben-Gurion International
Airport, reported a 15 percent drop in the number of passengers who
passed through the airport in the first two weeks of September,
saying, ``To my great sorrow, the gulf crisis has caused a sharp
decrease in the movement of passengers.''
   Yossi Shoval, spokesman for Israel's Tourism Ministry, also
blamed the slowdown on Israel being tarred with the same brush as
the gulf.
   ``We are 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from Baghdad, but in the
perception of the TV viewer we are right there,'' Shoval
complained.
   Shoval said he believed neighboring countries such as Egypt,
Turkey and Greece also would suffer a drop in tourism from the gulf
crisis. Egypt, for example, has reported overall tourism is off 40
percent since August.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, the timing of the gulf crisis is
particularly cruel. Most hotels had only recently begun to recover
from a sharp drop in visitors during the first two years of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Fuad Abul Hajj, general manager of the National Palace Hotel in
Arab east Jerusalem, said an average of 85 percent of his hotel's
108 rooms were occupied in March, April and May, much higher than
last year.
   ``Now we have had so many cancellations - 80 percent of our
September bookings,'' Abul Hajj said.
   He said Christian tour groups also were backing out of
reservations made for October and November, the run-up season to
Christmas.
   ``There is nothing we can do,'' he said with resignation. ``How
can you expect people to come to the Middle East with that kind of
crisis in the gulf?''
   Souvenir salesman Abu Assab concurred. ``When there is
stability, there are tourists,'' he said. ``When there is fear,
they go away.''
   Even government-sponsored events have not been immune to the
gulf crisis:
   - One-third of the guests invited to the opening of the Israel
Museum's new modern art wing Sept. 3 failed to show, including the
family of the principal American benefactor.
   - Twenty of the 90 American Jews who were to be part of the
prime minister's mission of major contributors in August canceled
their trips.
   The Israeli tourism industry faced an added problem this week.
The Finance Ministry has recommended tourism services be subjected
to a 16 percent tax to help raise money for the Soviet immigrants.
A committee is studying the proposal.
   ``It is coming at a particularly bad time,'' said Moshe Amir,
managing director of the Israeli Hotel Association. ``We face
strong competition from other countries in the Middle East, and
raising prices could really hurt.''

   As July ended, Egypt was celebrating a
tourism boom with no end in sight. Almost 3 million visitors last
year, and officials foresaw visions of at least 5 million by 1995.
   Egypt finally was returning as an international tourist mecca
after years of Middle East uncertainty that had devastated an
industry as old as the pyramids.
   Then, on Aug. 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``Tourism is an industry sensitive to regional politics,'' said
Fuad Sultan, Egypt's tourism minister. ``If you're scared to travel
to a country, you don't come.''
   And many aren't. Overall tourism is down 40 percent. Tourism
from the United States has dried up almost overnight. Holy Land
tours to Egypt and Israel are being canceled en masse.
   ``One man, Saddam Hussein, has managed to convince the world
that the whole Middle East is embroiled in a Holy War, Moslems
killing Christians, another Crusade,'' Sultan said.
   ``In one day Saddam Hussein undid what we took five years to
build: a large American tourist market. He convinced tourists that
God and Satan were slugging it out on the streets of Cairo, that
Christians would be killed if they came to a Moslem country.
   ``What rubbish!''
   Sultan said his envoys are spreading the word that Egypt is
safe, 1,000 miles from Iraq.
   ``Every tourist who doesn't come here because of this man's
echoes, his mouthing off, is letting Saddam Hussein win,'' he said.
   Annual tourist figures, calculated every July, were being
readied for public release at the time of the Iraqi invasion.
Sultan said 2.8 million visitors deposited more than $2.5 billion
into Egypt's debt-ridden economy, an all-time high.
   Almost 150,000 Americans and nearly 1.2 million Europeans
visited Egypt in 1989.
   Sultan said cancellations were few early in August. The industry
was in good shape because of a large number of well-to-do Arab
families spending the summer in Cairo. Pre-paid Western tour groups
also still came.
   But by this month officials feared the worst as they looked
ahead to the beginning of Egypt's tourist season in October.
   ``We went to work to pick up European tourists to make up for
the disappearing Americans,'' Sultan said.
   ``We knew that people weren't coming because they were scared.
We realized there is nothing to be done for a tourist who is
panicked, afraid he can't get back home if fighting occurs.
   ``But there is something we can do for a tourist who wants to
come but has a few doubts. We can persuade him to come. This is
what's happening. We are . . . taking steps to reassure the
Americans they should really come ahead.''
   Alia Noor is the Cairo-based national sales manager for the
Hilton hotel chain. She said American cancellations are running
about 50 percent so far but that her staff is on the telephone
daily to ensure that European charter flights don't cancel.
   ``So far it's worked,'' she said. ``We keep telling people to
come here and see for yourself. Cairo's great.''
   Hassan Kamy, head of a large Egyptian tourist company, blamed
sensationalism in the foreign news media for slanting Middle East
events toward Cairo.
   ``We're a long way from Iraq, from the action,'' Kamy said.
``Nothing's happning here. But the media, particularly the
American media, have sensationalized what's happening in Egypt by
200 percent, at least.
   ``We're suffering. I keep saying to other travel agents we must
get out, call our agents around the world, tell them Egypt is fine,
bring the people.''
   Tension in the Middle East affects tourism according to the
nationality of the tourist, he said.
   ``Most Europeans have come despite the problems. The Germans are
great. They're stubborn. They come anyhow. The Asians are far away
and plan and pay ahead. So they're still coming,'' Kamy said.
   But he said there are two critical areas: international

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise With Surging Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as surging energy
prices fanned inflation fears.
   Crude oil for near-term delivery soared above $39 a barrel
Monday in reaction to warlike rhetoric from Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein over the weekend.
   ``When you see $39 crude, maybe the attitude is that grain
prices are a little too cheap here,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of
Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s trading floor operations at the Board of
Trade.
   The run-up in oil prices overshadowed such bearish factors as
slack export demand for U.S. grains and forecasts for favorable
growing conditions in the Corn Belt.
   ``You're looking at 70s and 80s in most of the Midwest this
week,'' Zusel said. ``Some of this grain that's a little late in
maturing should get pushed along.''
   At the close, wheat futures were 4{ cents to 6 cents higher with
December at $2.75\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 3 cents
higher with December at $2.28{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\
cents lower with December at $1.12{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 2{ cents higher with November at $6.14 a bushel.

   Share prices fell Monday on London's Stock
Exchange, sending a major market index to 20-month lows despite
unexpectedly strong British trade figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
35.2 points, or 1.7 percent, at 1,990.3. The market was at its
lowest level since Jan. 26, 1989, when it closed at 1,959.8.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed down 26.9 points at
1,510.4. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 16.54 points to
close at 1,070.29.
   Volume was 500.3 million shares, compared to 553.7 million
shares Friday.
   The government reported that Britain's merchandise trade deficit
narrowed sharply to a better-than-expected 1.13 billion pounds, or
$2.1 billion, in August.
   The improvement came on a decline in imports, which suggested a
slowing in the economy.
   July's deficit came to 1.68 billion pounds, or $3.2 billion.

<HEAD>Journal: AmEx Officials Were Behind Smear Campaign of Swiss Banker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high American Express Co. official
orchestrated a smear campaign of Edmond J. Safra, the Swiss banker
who had a falling-out with the financial services giant, The Wall
Street Journal said Monday in an investigative report.
   Harry L. Freeman, then an executive vice president with close
ties to company chairman James D. Robinson III, approved the hiring
of a private detective and a public relations executive who
investigated Safra and then spread rumors about him, the Journal
said.
   ``Company officials privately blamed the incident on a handful
of unnamed low-level employees,'' the front-page story said.
   ``But a lengthy investigation by this newspaper reveals evidence
suggesting the effort to smear Mr. Safra was in fact overseen from
Mr. Freeman's office, only steps away from Mr. Robinson's.''
   False news stories about Safra began to surface in early 1988,
linking him to drug dealers, money laundering and the Mafia, the
Journal said.
   The newspaper said there was no concrete evidence that Robinson
knew of the campaign against Safra, although the American Express
chairman had regular contact with one of Freeman's operatives,
Susan Cantor.
   Last year, American Express publicly apologized to Safra,
admitting that people acting on its behalf had tried to discredit
Safra. American Express paid $8 million to charities of Safra's
choice to make amends.
   Freeman later retired from the company, accepting responsibility
for ``mistakes made on my watch.''
   Larry Armour, an American Express spokesman, said Monday that
the Journal story ``discussed events that took place at least a
year ago. We said at that time what needed to be said in terms of
the steps we took. We admitted that something did indeed go awry.
We apologized about it.''
   Armour continued, ``We ran a very extensive internal
investigation that was run by the audit committee of the board of
directors. ... They came back with recommendations on policy and
procedures which we have put in place.''
   ``It's senseless to respond to old news, no matter how
colorfully someone chooses to repackage it,'' Armour said.
   The Journal said it gathered its information from interviews
with dozens of people involved in the Safra affair, including
journalists, private detectives and 15 current and former American
Express executives. The story, headlined ``The Vendetta,'' was
written by reporter Bryan Burrough.
   The Journal said American Express and Safra began to fall out
soon after Robinson decided in 1983 to buy Safra's Geneva-based
Trade Development Bank and combine it with American Express Bank.
   The styles of the two men differed sharply, and in 1984 Safra
resigned from the company. The split between Safra and Robinson
deepened during negotiations on a settlement package, and matters
grew worse as American Express Bank officials began to suspect that
Safra, who was planning to begin another Swiss bank in 1988 was
hiring away American Express employees, the Journal said.
   Robert Smith, the former chairman of American Express Bank, told
the Journal he had informed Robinson he had hired detectives to
follow the former American Express workers.
   Smith told the Journal he had become obsessed with stopping
Safra, and that his aides began looking for any kind of evidence
that might be used against Safra in a possible Internal Revenue
Service probe.
   Anger against Safra spread to other American Express executives,
the Journal said, and the company tried in vain to block his
attempt to get a new banking license in Switzerland in 1987.
   In 1988, after he had opened his new bank, articles began to
appear in newspapers in Europe and South America linking Safra to
the Mafia, now-deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, South
American drug traffickers, the CIA and the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The articles, which threatened Safra's reputation for honesty,
raised questions in the minds of his aides about a possible
connection to American Express, the Journal said.
   A first link to American Express was found during the course of
a libel suit Safra filed against a French newspaper, Minute, the
Journal said. One of Safra's lawyers found that a Life magazine
article about the Mafia had been faxed to Minute from American
Express headquarters in New York, the Journal said.
   Investigators working for Safra's lawyers, including New York
attorney Stanley Arkin, eventually found that the source of the
articles was Antonio Greco, an elusive businessman with homes in
Spain and New York City.
   In reality, Greco was an investigator working for American
Express, the Journal said. Greco also had an arrest record in the
United States and Italy going back to 1962, and had been convicted
on charges including theft, conspiracy and handling stolen goods,
the newspaper said.
   Safra's investigators also discovered the Greco had a link at
American Express, Susan Cantor, now a senior vice president at
American Express Bank and before that an employee in the American
Express public relations office, working under Harry Freeman, the
Journal said.
   The Journal said Freeman had been ``a willing ear'' when
American Express Bank officials began voicing their concerns about
Safra. Freeman had a penchant for unorthodox projects, the
newspaper said.
   Freeman was convinced that Safra wanted to destroy American
Express Bank and began collecting rumors about him, the Journal
said.
   The newspaper said Freeman initially used Ms. Cantor, a former
ABC News employee, to gather information on Safra. But her task
evolved to spreading rumors and negative news stories about Safra.
   Ms. Cantor made a number of trips to Europe to find information
about Safra and then to disseminate the false stories, the Journal
said.
   Ms. Cantor also worked closely with Robinson, helping plan his
trips to Latin America and later mediating a dispute between
American Express Bank and American Express's Shearson Lehman Hutton
brokerage subsidiary.
   In a statement to the Journal, Ms. Cantor said she ``never
intended or sought to dissseminate false information concerning
Edmond Safra to anyone, and I never instructed, asked or engaged
anyone to spread such information.''

   The stock market sank to new lows for the year
today in activity marked by heavy selling of the battered bank
issues.
   Analysts said investors were bracing for more bad tidings from
the banking industry after Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement
Friday of a dividend cut, new reserves for loan losses, and a staff
reduction of 5,000 jobs.
   The news by itself did not come as any great surprise to Wall
Street, which was well aware of widespread credit problems facing
the banks.
   Nevertheless, it evidently served to intensify the recession
worries that have been depressing stock prices since midsummer.
   Brokers noted that the market also had to contend with another

<TEXT>
   The presidents of the U.S. and
Australian coal miners' unions signed an agreement Monday pledging
cooperation in dealing with multinational corporations.
   The agreement, signed at the United Mine Workers' 100th
anniversary convention, stemmed from the 10-month Pittston Co.
strike in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   During that strike, which ended last February, the United
Mineworkers' Federation of Australia told Japanese buyers that
Australian miners would not help fill coal contracts which Pittston
was unable to meet.
   Union officials credit the Australian miners' position with
causing Japanese customers to put pressure on Pittston, helping to
end the strike.
   ``That was clearly an incident which sent shock waves through
the international community,'' said John Maitland, general
president of the United Mineworkers' Federation of Australia.
   The agreement signed Monday pledges that mine workers in the
United States, Canada and Australia, many of whom work for the same
global corporations, will help each other stop those multinational
companies ``from exploiting workers nation by nation,'' Maitland
said.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said he signed the agreement ``so
our two countries never scab on one another ever in the future.''
   The practical effect of the agreement, however, is not clear
because U.S. labor law prohibits ``secondary boycotts'' against
companies because of a strike against a different operation.
   The convention, which began Sept. 17, ends Tuesday with
addresses by U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and United
Steelworkers union President Lynn Williams.

<HEAD>Chase's Retrenchment May Be First Shot in Banking Cutbacks,
Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement that it
will slash its dividend and eliminate 5,000 jobs could signal
impending cutbacks by other major banks, analysts said Monday.
   The nation's second-largest bank said Friday it would halve its
dividend this quarter because it planned to set aside more than
$650 million by Sept. 30 to bolster reserves for loans that may go
bad. Most of the loans financed commercial real estate.
   But analysts said real estate is just one trouble spot for major
banks as the economy deteriorates.
   Among other concerns are the loans that helped finance the wave
of corporate buyouts in the 1980s. As business slows at the
companies acquired through these leveraged buyouts, the likelihood
that the loans will be repaid in full diminishes, analysts say.
   One industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Chase may be just the first among top banks to scale back. The
source said Citibank, the nation's largest, and Chemical Banking
Corp., No. 6, both could be forced to retrench due to low levels of
reserves compared with potentially troubled loans.
   Other major banks ``are going to watch closely to see whether
the dividend cut hurts Chase's standing among the financial
community'' before considering following suit, said analyst Mark
Lynch of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   One major bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., issued a statement
that it has every reason to believe its dividend will remain
unchanged.
   And it's not just the huge ``money center'' banks that are
hurting. Some regional banks, particularly in New England, the
Southeast and the Midwest, have been troubled for months as the
strong real estate market of the 1980s went bust.
   Two smaller banks said Friday they would cut their dividends as
they prepare for tougher times. Midlantic Corp. of Edison, N.J.,
slashed its dividend in half as it announced it expects to lose at
least $150 million this quarter. Southeast Banking Corp. of Miami
said it would eliminate its dividend entirely this quarter due to a
loss it projects will be $87 million.
   A stable history of dividend payments is one of the key reasons
investors put their money in bank stocks. Chase became the first
major New York bank to cut its dividend in at least 15 years, Lynch
said.
   Not surprisingly, Wall Street reacted severely to the news of
the bank dividend cuts. Chase's stock lost $1 a share Friday and an
additional $1.62{ Monday, to close at $11.12{. Earlier this year,
it was as high as $30.75.
   Among other bank stocks Monday, Citicorp fell 50 cents to close
at $15.25, Chemical Bank lost $1.87{ to end at $15.12{ and
Manufacturers Hanover slipped 25 cents to $22.75.
   The decline in bank stocks was blamed in part for a drop in the
entire market Friday and Monday.
   The bond market also has shown concern. Prices of notes to raise
cash, issued by Citicorp, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover,
all dropped Monday.
   ``There is a lot of hysteria and uncertainty as to what the
future holds for banking. It's scaring the heck out of everyone,''
said Stephen Berman, who follows banking for the investment firm
County NatWest USA.
   Berman said the concern stems in part from the fact that ``banks
are a microcosm of the economy.'' As the economy deteriorates, some
investors fear banks will go down with it.
   The fear about the health of banks also arises from the fact
that little is publicly disclosed about what banks hold in their
loan portfolios.
   ``The banks are a blind pool of assets,'' Lynch said. ``People
are assuming that the worst of everything is in the loan
portfolios.''
   At the same time, regulators are stepping up pressure on banks
to have adequate provisions to cover bad loans, especially in light
of the savings and loan debacle.
   But analysts said some of the concern about the health of banks
is misplaced. Many banks already have put aside enough money to
cover potentially bad loans and they shouldn't need to scale back
unless the nation enters a long recession.
   However, a number of analysts said Citicorp may be in a riskier
position than is generally believed.
   ``The party line at Citicorp is that they're more conservative
than other banks - the level of problem loans doesn't hold the same
degree of loss potential. I have some difficulty with that,''
Berman said.
   He said that as of June 30, Citicorp had put aside enough money
to cover 25 percent of the loans it identified as potentially
troubled. By contrast, by the end of this quarter, Chase will have
50 percent of its potentially bad loans covered by reserves, he
said.

<HEAD>Third Man Convicted in Guinness Trial To Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald Ronson, who was fined a record 5 million
pounds for his part in the Guinness scandal, on Monday became the
third defendant to appeal his conviction in the case.
   Ronson, 51, was found guilty last month along with former
Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders and stockbroker Anthony Parnes of
fraudulently engineering Guinness PLC's 1986 takeover of Distillers
Ltd.
   Ronson, the head of Heron International PLC, was ordered jailed
for a year and fined 5 million pounds, or $9.4 million, the largest
fine in British history, for his involvement in the affair, which
involved the boosting of Guinness shares during the company's 2.7
billion pound, or $4.96 billion, takeover of Distillers.
   Saunders, 54, who was sentenced to five years in prison, and
Parnes, 44, who was given 2{ years in jail, appealed their
convictions and sentences on Friday, their lawyers said.
   All three appeals were filed through the Court of Appeal in
London and no dates have been set for the hearings.
   In a short statement, Mishcon De Reya, the firm of lawyers
representing Ronson, said Ronson had been advised he had
substantial grounds for appeal.
   A fourth man convicted, financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, was freed
on bail so he can undergo surgery. He was to be sentenced Tuesday.
   The jury found the four had secretly and illegally rigged the
stock market to inflate the price of Guinness shares when the
company successfully battled the Argyll supermarket chain for
control of Distillers.
   The 113-day trial at Southwark Crown Court heard that the 25
million pound, or $46 million, stock support operation involved the
payment by Guinness of indemnities against share dealing losses and
``success fees'' after the bid came off.
   Saunders and three other Britons will stand trial later this
year on further charges arising from the Guinness affair.

   The stock market fell sharply to a 14-month low

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 59.41 to
2,452.97, its lowest close since it stood at 2,452.77 on July 3,
1989.
   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by about 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
233 up, 1,432 down and 326 unchanged.
   Analysts said investors were bracing for more bad tidings from

   Chase Manhattan stock fell 1| to 11&lsqb; on turnover of more than 5

   Among other leading money-center bank issues, Citicorp dropped {

at 40&lsqb;; General Electric, down 1&rsqb; at 54{; Philip Morris, down ~ at
43~, and International Business Machines, down 1} at 105.
   Airline stocks also posted some notable losses as the oil-price
spiral continued. UAL fell 8{ to 92\ amid new misgivings about the
chances to revive a buyout plan for the company.
   Delta Air Lines, which estimated ``significantly worse'' results
for the quarter ending Sunday, lost 1| to 53.
   Oil stocks were mostly lower as well. But precious-metals issues
rose as the price of gold climbed above $400 an ounce.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 162.21 million
shares, against 201.05 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 194.23 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 3.52 to 167.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 7.81 to 359.29, and

   The dollar sank against all major currencies
Monday except the Japanese yen in selling sparked by speculation
that industrialized countries might not try to stop the dollar from
sinking further.
   News that the government's pool of red ink swelled to a record
level in August also weighed down the dollar.
   Prices of gold jumped as another surge in oil futures
intensified inflation fears. Gold traditionally has been considered
a hedge against inflation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the metal settled at $403
a troy ounce for the September contract, up $13.60 from Friday.
Later, Republic National Bank quoted an ounce of gold bullion at
$402.50, $13 higher than Friday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Silver prices went up in sympathy with gold. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.915 a troy
ounce, up from $4.790 an ounce Friday.
   Trading in the foreign exchange markets was choppy, with
attention directed largely at the relative values of the German
mark and the Japanese yen, currency dealers said.
   The yen lost ground in New York amid concern that a prolonged
oil price spiral could damage the Japanese economy.
   The dollar fell to a closing 135.57 yen in London from 137.33
yen at Friday's Tokyo close. Tokyo markets were closed Monday for
Autumnal Equinox Day. But as trading ended in New York, the dollar
was quoted at 137.50 yen, up from 136.65 yen on Friday.
   The dollar's weakness against most of its foreign counterparts
followed a weekend statement from the Group of Seven finance
ministers calling for continued firm monetary policies in the face
of high oil prices, which are stoking inflation.
   Oil futures rocketed higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the contract for November delivery of light sweet crude gained
$2.82 to settle at $38.25 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The G-7 statement also expressed contentment with recent
movements in currency values, implying that the monetary
authorities might not object to more of the same movements, dealers
said. The G-7 members are the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, Canada, France and Italy.
   A monthly report on the federal budget deficit also was a
negative for the dollar.The deficit expanded by $52.8 billion to a
record $241.7 billion in August - 67 percent larger than it was in
the first 11 months of fiscal 1989.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8810 from $1.8465 late
Friday. A pound was quoted at $1.8805 late in New York, up from
late Friday's $1.8430.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
late quotes, included: 1.5595 German marks, down from 1.5775;
1.2980 Swiss francs, down from 1.3190; 5.2210 French francs, down
from 5.2815; 1.14975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1529; and
1,167.75 Italian lire, down from 1,175.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's levels,

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Monday it is merging
its paper products businesses in Italy, Spain, Portugal and the
United Kingdom with those of the Fater group of companies.
   The companies declined to reveal terms of the agreement. The
Fater companies are a privately held group based in Pescara, Italy.
   Procter &amp; Gamble and Fater said the joint effort assures their
future within the increasingly competitive European market. The
joint venture also accelerates P&amp;G's entry into the European market
for feminine sanitary napkin and adult incontinence products,
because of Fater's success in those markets, P&amp;G officials said.
   Under the agreement, a new company will be formed in Italy under
dual control. This company will include the present Fater
businesses making and selling sanitary napkins, disposable baby
diapers and adult incontinence products; the Fameccanica machinery
company; the Faricerca, Faidata and Fatecnica research companies,
and P&amp;G's Pampers baby diaper business.
   In Spain and Portugal, Ausonia and Lepori businesses will be
combined with the Arbora company, which Procter &amp; Gamble jointly
controls with the Agrolimen group. In the United Kingdom, the
Swaddlers company will be integrated within P&amp;G.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, had $24 billion in
worldwide sales for the fiscal year ended June 30.

   Oil prices jumped to near $40 per barrel on the
futures market Monday, about double the price before Iraq invaded
Kuwait and close to the level of cash prices paid 10 years ago
during the Iranian revolution.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil shot over $1
per gallon as the market responded to amplified fears about the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``If war breaks out and affects Saudi Arabia, prices could go
much higher,'' said Philip L. Dodge, an analyst with Nomura
Securities International Inc. ``That seems to be the expectation
now.''
   After peaking at $39.20 per barrel in the afternoon, light sweet
crude for November delivery settled up $2.82 at $38.25 per barrel -
a new record on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where oil futures
have been traded since 1983.
   Crude opened the day at $37.20, surpassing a record set Friday,
then quickly rose above the $38 mark, where it stayed for the rest
of the trading session.
   The sharp rise had speculators guessing that oil futures might
soon hit the $40 mark, matching the cash price paid in 1980.
   Trader Ed Kevelson at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said the new
highs were coming in fairly light volume as Monday's rapid rise
scared off some investors.
   The surge was attributed to saber-rattling from Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, who indicated he might launch an all-out war,
possibly by attacking Saudi oil fields, rather than allow the U.N.
trade embargo to ``strangle'' Iraq. Recent estimates have put the
price of oil at $60 per barrel if a shooting war breaks out.
   Meanwhile, stock prices were broadly lower Monday in response to
the Gulf and other factors affecting the economy, especially the
precarious position of the nation's banks. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 59.41 at 2,452.97.
   Oil's dramatic rise helped jack up the price of refined
petroleum products, which had been moving steadily higher recently
on fears of supply shortages.
   Home heating oil was up 6.71 cents to $1.039 per gallon for
October delivery. Unleaded gasoline rose 6.78 cents to $1.042 per
gallon for October contracts.
   Gasoline futures last traded above $1 on Aug. 24, while heating
oil futures had not been that high since the price spike last
December.
   Natural gas also rose sharply Monday, with November contracts up
6.4 cents to $1.936 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Analysts said $40 oil could push up inflation, while prompting
bigger increases for gasoline prices at the pump.
   The nationwide Lundberg Survey of 18,500 gas stations found that
the average price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump has hit an
all-time high of slightly more than $1.38, slightly higher than a
previous record of just under $1.38, set in March 1981.
   Still, when prices are adjusted for inflation, Americans are
paying far less for energy than they paid in the early 1980s.
   Dodge, the Nomura analyst, said oil would have to hit $57 per
barrel to be as high as the $40 price in 1980, during the Iranian
revolution.
   But pump prices have not kept pace with crude during the runup
and could accelerate.
   ``Forty dollars for crude oil is up about $20 from where it was
before all this unpleasantness got started,'' Dodge said. ``That
$20 increase is about 48 cents per gallon, and so far, the price of
gasoline is only up about half of that. It eventually could go up
another 25 cents.''
   Oil, trading at $21.54 per barrel on Aug. 1, has been on the
rise since Iraq invaded Kuwait the following day, but the market is
feeling especially pinched now that the boycott of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil is taking effect.
   ``Basically, the whole world now has gotten the last of the
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Oil's previous high price on the Mercantile Exchange was $35.60
per barrel, which came on Friday to cap a string of records set
last week.

<HEAD>Willis Faber, Corroon Agree To Special Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. and Willis Faber PLC said
Monday they would pay Corroon and Black shareholders a special
dividend that effectively sweetens the terms of the insurance
brokers' proposed merger.
   The extra dividend of $2.50 a share would be payable subject to
the completion of the merger following a special Corroon &amp; Black
shareholders' meeting Oct. 4.
   New York-based Corroon &amp; Black rejected last week an offer of
$840 million, or $40 a share, from Chicago-based Aon Corp. intended
to spoil Corroon's 2-month-old plan to merge with Britain's Willis
Faber.
   Corroon &amp; Black rejected the Aon offer despite its being worth
more than plan to merger with Willis Faber, which values Corroon &amp;
Black at more than $750 million, or about $33.50 a share.
   The dividend announced Monday would add $51 million to the total
price of the deal.
   The Corroon &amp; Black board of directors argued that the tie with
Willis Faber would give the company greater long-term strength,
particularly because of the British broker's strong position in the
London insurance market.
   Under the merger accord, Willis Faber will issue 7.8 of its
shares for each of the 20.5 million Corroon &amp; Black shares
outstanding.
   Willis Faber's stock closed at 214 pence, or $4.02 a share, on
London's Stock Exchange, while Corroon &amp; Black stock rose 25 cents
to $29.50 on the New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Soar On Oil's Gains, Dollar's Lapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices roared above $400 an ounce Monday as soaring
energy prices, crumbling stock prices and a slumping dollar renewed
investor interest in precious metals.
   On other commodity markets, coffee prices sagged; grains and
soybeans were mostly higher; cattle futures fell; and pork futures
were mixed.
   Gold settled $13.60 to $15.30 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at $403 a troy
ounce, the highest level in a month.
   Silver futures ended 12.5 cents to 13.7 cents higher with
September at $4.915 a troy ounce.
   Demand for gold was triggered mainly by an enormous jump in oil
prices and a nearly 60-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials
average, largely in reaction to heightened fears of war in the
Middle East, analysts said.
   Iraq's leaders warned over the weekend that they would launch an
all-out war before allowing the U.N. trade embargo to ``strangle''
their nation.
   In addition to the twin threats of greater inflation and
international turmoil, two traditional buy signals for gold,
analysts said precious metals were supported by a further decline
in the dollar's value against other major currencies.
   James Steel, an energy and precious-metals analyst with Refco
Inc. in New York, noted the dollar had strengthened during the oil
crises of the 1970s.
   ``Other oil-importing countries like Japan and Germany have seen
their currencies appreciate,'' Steel said. ``This could indicate
that in this time of rising energy prices, the world has more
confidence in their economies than in ours.''
   Analysts said the large-scale selling of physical gold that kept
a lid on prices last week appeared to have abated, which may have
encouraged speculators to buy gold futures.
   In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil futures settled 45 cents to $2.82 higher with
November at $38.25 a barrel; heating oil was 1.75 cents to 6.71
cents higher with October at $1.0392 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was 4 cents to 6.78 cents higher with October at $1.0423 a gallon.
   Coffee futures plunged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange after Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, called
for a one-year extension of an international pact that containes no
coffee export limits.
   Several other large coffee-producing countries, including
olombia, have been pushing for a return to export quotas to boost
prices.
   Coffee settled 2.25 cents to 3.5 cents lower with December at 94
cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade as surging energy prices fanned inflation fears.
   The runup in oil prices overshadowed such bearish factors as
slack export demand for U.S. grains and forecasts for favorable
growing conditions in the Corn Belt.
   In a report released after the close, the Agriculture Department
said corn and soybean development continues to lag behind the
normal pace. Fifty-three percent of the corn crop was mature as of
Sunday compared with a 76 percent average for that date; 41 percent
of the soybean crop was at the leaf-drop stage compared with a 57
percent norm.
   Wheat futures ended 4 cents to 5\ cents higher with December at
$2.75\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 3\ cents higher with December
at $2.28} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent lower with December
at $1.12{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher
with November at $6.13{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid
perceptions that higher inflation and econonic recession would lead
to reduced beef consumption.
   Hog futures ended mixed after a volatile session in which
spillover selling from the cattle pits offset stronger demand for
pork products.
   Live cattle futures ended .32 cent to .83 cent lower with
October at 79.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent to .93
cent lower with September at 89.25 cents a pound; live hogs were
.38 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October at 55.15 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .65 cent higher with
February at 56.40 cents a pound.

   Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. on Monday

trucks.
   Chrysler said it will install new fuel injectors in 106,000 1987
cars and station wagons equipped with 2.5-liter engines to reduce
excessive carbon monoxide emissions.
   The affected cars include Plymouth Caravelle and Reliant; Dodge

   Ford said it was recalling about 102,800 1988- and 1989-model

vapor hose could be kinked and cause the release of unacceptable
levels of hydrocarbon evaporatives.
   Inspection and repairs in both recalls will be performed free of

Cable TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading American media companies said Monday
they've formed a joint venture to help develop and operate cable
television in Hungary, one of the most rapidly advancing countries
in Eastern Europe.
   Time Warner Inc. and United International Holdings Inc. didn't
divulge the value of their proposed investment, but said they plan
to begin new programming in Hungary by early next year.
   Their announcement marks another prominent example of U.S.
investment in Eastern Europe, which has moved aggressively to
dismantle four decades of centralized control and adopt free-market
economics with help from Western money, technology and expertise.
U.S. businesses ranging from automaking to light bulbs to
laundromats are now involved in Eastern European projects.
   Time Warner and UIH said in a news release they will work with
Hungarian TV operators to expand the country's cable industry,
which already is considered among the more advanced in Eastern
Europe and now serves an estimated half-million subscribers.
   Time Warner will supervise development of programming services
and UIH will supervise technical operating and operation, the
companies said. UIH has been exploring the Hungarian cable market
for more than a year and has agreements with local cable systems
representing more than 200,000 subscribers there.
   Time Warner, based in New York, is one of the world's largest
media and entertainment conglomerates, with operations in
magazines, publishing, films, recorded music, cable television and
programming.
   UIH, based in Denver, runs several cable television systems in
Europe, operates per-per-view and shopping mall advertising and is
the largest franchisee of Blockbuster Video stores in the United
States.

   The savings and loan bailout agency needs to
do a better job of monitoring the private contractors it hires,
congressional auditors warned Monday.
   The General Accounting Office told a Senate subcommittee that
the Resolution's Trust Corp.'s internal controls to monitor
contractors have ``not been as good as we would like.''
   ``Progress has been made toward developing a management
structure to mitigate its vulnerability to fraud, waste, and
abuse,'' Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher told the Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittee on federal services.
   But he added: ``More needs to be done.''
   He said GAO auditors had visited the agency's Southwest regional
office and said, ``we found no detailed instructions, procedures or
other guidance to help regional personnel monitor the activities of
contractors.''
   Auditors also said the regional office visited as well as two
subordinate offices had no plans in place for monitoring the
performance of contractors, and that the broad guidance distributed
from agency headquarters was inadequate.
   Lamar C. Kelly Jr., director of the bailout agency's asset and
real estate management division, said the 13-month-old agency's
officials are not yet satisfied with its system of overseeing
contractors but added, ``We're 75 percent there. We will be 100
percent by the end of the year.''
   The agency is also making progress on hiring its own employees.
It has a staff of 5,400 of a planned 6,200, Kelly said.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee, called
the RTC ``the fastest growing contractor and consultant industry in
the world.''
   The RTC plans to spend $800 million next year on service
contracts. It plans to hire outside firms to manage up to $30
billion in problem real estate.

<HEAD>U.S. Tobacco Firms Have $2.5 Billion Trade Surplus In First Half
of
1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. tobacco industry recorded a
trade surplus of $2.5 billion for the first half of 1990, an
increase of $554 million from the same period last year, an
industry group said Monday.
   The United States exported $2.95 billion dollars worth of
tobacco products and raw leaf during the first six months of 1990,
according to Thomas Slane, a vice-president of the Tobacco
Merchants Association. The bulk, $2.2 billion, was finished
products, including shipments of 73.7 billion cigarettes worth
$2.05 billion.
   The biggest markets for U.S.-made cigarettes were Belgium and
Japan, each accounting for about 29 percent of exports.
   The United States imported $463 million of tobacco during the
first half of the year, most of which was bulk leaf, Slane said.
   The United States ran an overall trade deficit of $41.1 billion
during the first half of the year.
   Slane attributed the increased surplus to the lowering of trade
barriers against American cigarettes.
   ``The opening of cigarette markets in Japan, Taiwan and South
Korea to U.S. exporters has generated an additional $287 million
for U.S. tobacco farmers,'' Slane said.

<HEAD>Honda to Have Driver and Passenger Side Air Bags as Standard in
'94</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. will equip all of
its cars with driver- and passenger-side air bags by the 1994 model
year, the company's top executive said Monday.
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who became the Japanese company's president
and chief executive officer last June, told reporters the devices
will replace automatic seat belts now on its cars.
   Kawamoto, in his first U.S. tour as head of Honda, declined to
speculate how many Honda and Acura cars the company would sell in
the United States by the time air bags became standard equipment.
   Through the first eight months of this year, Honda sold 593,508
cars, up 11.2 percent from the same time last year.
   Currently, Chrysler Corp. equips all of its U.S.-made cars with
driver-side air bags, but cars it receives from other companies,
notably Mitsubishi Motors Corp., do not have the safety devices.
   General Motors Corp. said it will expand the use of driver and
passenger side air bags to all of its domestically designed cars by
late 1995 for the 1996 model year. Ford Motor Co. said by the
mid-1990s it would equip all of its cars with driver and passenger
side air bags.
   On others matters, Kawamoto said Monday:
   -Honda plans no further plant expansions in the United States in
the near future. He said the company will focus on its U.S.
research and development operations and increase the amount of
U.S.-made components in its cars assembled in Honda's two Ohio
plants past the current level of about 75 percent.
   ``The expansion (of production capacity) is the second
priority,'' he said. Honda's Marysville, Ohio, plant is running
near to its capacity while its new East Liberty, Ohio, factory is
slowly increasing its production toward capacity.
   -No decision has been made on whether Honda will build a minivan
for the U.S. or Asian markets.
   ``We still have many things to do like the Accord wagon,''
Kawamoto said. Honda will introduce a station wagon version of its
popular Accord sedan this fall for the 1991 model year.
   -Like other automakers, Honda opposes legislation in Congress
now mandating a 20percent increase in auto manufacturers'
corporate average fuel economy ratings by the turn of the century.
It's been speculated that the minimum fuel-economy figures could
reach as much as 40 mpg by that time under the legislation.
   Automakers have said raising the fuel economy ratings of cars by
making them smaller, lighter and less powerful, runs against the
grain of what U.S. customers want.
   ``I think the target seems to be, from a technical point of
view, very challenging,'' Kawamoto said.

   The board of directors of Emerson Electric Co.
approved Monday the spin-off of its six defense-related
subsidiaries into a separate company called Esco Electronics Corp.
   The spin-off will allow Emerson to focus on ``faster growing and
more profitable commercial business,'' said Charles Knight,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Also on Monday, Esco announced that the new company will not be
suspended from competing for U.S. government contracts. Emerson had
been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in St. Louis
after the company pleaded guilty May 1 to making inflated cost
estimates for electronic equipment.
   The company was fined $14 million in fines and penalties.
   The investigation was not a factor in deciding to spin off the
defense subsidiaries, company officials said. Rather, Emerson
wanted to give the subsidiaries more freedom to compete in the
changing defense industry.
   Emerson's directors approved a stock exchange that will give
shareholders equity in the new company.
   Under the formula, which awaits Securities and Exchange
Commission approval, Emerson shareholders of record at the close of
business Oct. 5 will be eligible to receive one Esco share of
common stock for every 20 shares of Emerson common stock they own.
   The six former Emerson subsidiaries are: Electronics &amp; Space
Corp., St. Louis; Hazeltine Corp., Greenlawn, N.Y.; Rantee
Microwave and Electronics Corp., Calabasas, Calif.; Southwest
Mobile Systems Corp., St. Louis; Vacco Industries, South El Monte,
Calif., and Distribution Control Systems Inc., St. Louis.
   Emerson is the world's leading maker of electric motors. The
company also makes equipment for factory assembly lines, tools for
Sears, ceiling fans, garbage disposals, refrigerator compressors,
and uninterrupted power supplies for computers.
   Esco will be involved principally in developing, manufacturing
and marketing defense-related electronic products and systems,
including communications and radar equipment, automatic test
equipment and anti-submarine warfare equipment.
   Net sales for the six former Emerson subsidiaries making up Esco
totaled about $600 million, of about 8 percent of Emerson's overall
net sales of $7.1 billion, in fiscal 1989.
   Pre-tax earnings were about $15 million. Esco employs about
6,100 people.

   The board of directors of Multimedia
Inc. has authorized the purchase of up to 750,000 shares of the
firm's outstanding common stock, the company said Monday.
   ``Under the current market conditions for the stock market as a
whole, as well as media stocks, the company thinks that if
conditions were to continue to deteriorate that it would seriously
consider purchasing its own stock,'' said Robert Hamby, chief
financial officer of Multimedia.
   With its announcement, Multimedia joined a number of other firms
that have begun or authorized stock buybacks as a result of recent
declines on Wall Street.
   Multimedia has 11.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.
   The company completed a refinancing on June 29. The refinancing,
which included $400 million private placement of unsecured senior
notes, provided Multimedia with $700 million in available credit.
   The financing also provided Multimedia with additional debt
capacity over its current needs of approximately $375 million.
   Multimedia Inc. is a communications company that publishes 13
daily newspapers and 49 non-daily newspapers and owns and operates
four television and eight radio stations and a video production
company.
   It also operates more than 100 cable television franchises in
four states and produces and syndicates the Phil Donahue and Sally

   Peter G. Diamandis left as chairman and chief
executive of Diamandis Communications Inc. Monday and the magazine
company's parent, Hachette Publications Inc., has renamed the firm.
   Diamandis' contract was due to expire at the end of the year,
but a press release from the company said the two sides agreed that
Monday would be his last day.
   The company, which publishes Woman's Day, Elle, Popular
Photography and other magazines, was renamed Hachette Magazines
Inc.
   Hachette bought Diamandis Communications in 1988 for $712
million.
   Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of the parent company, will
take over as chairman and chief executive of Hachette Magazines,
the company said.
   Earlier this year, Diamandis suspended bimonthly publication of
Memories magazine, going to a twice yearly schedule planned for
1991. The company cited weak advertising revenues for the switch.
The move came after efforts to sell the magazine failed.
   Woman's Day was also put up for sale this year, but pulled off
the block after bidders failed to show up with the price the
company wanted.

   The Senate narrowly rejected a proposal Monday
night to aid autoworkers laid off in any required shift by
automakers to higher-mileage cars.
   In debate on a bill to require cars to average 40 miles per
gallon, the Senate voted 49-46 to reject an amendment by Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., that would have provided special unemployment
assistance for those workers.
   A vote on whether to close off debate on the bill was scheduled
for Tuesday.
   ``The passage of this amendment will doom this bill,'' declared
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a co-sponsor.
   Later the Senate agreed, 55-40, to a include in the legislation
new incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on
alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol or natural gas. The
measure would allow manufacturers to claim credits against fuel
efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles.
   Similar fuel economy legislation has been introduced in the
House but has yet to emerge from committee.
   In earlier debate on the legislation, opponents argued that the
higher fuel economy requirements would be a death blow to the
midsize family sedan and force automakers to produce only small
cars.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., chief sponsor of the legislation,
disputed such claims, arguing higher fuel efficiency can be
achieved without sacrificing the six-passenger automobile.
   ``It means smaller cars, it means less safe cars,'' declared
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., who has led efforts to block
consideration of the measure.
   The legislation's supporters maintained that manufacturers have
shown in the past that they can come up with technologies to
improve fuel efficiency greatly and still provide customers with a
broad range of vehicle models.
   In aiming to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, the
bill would would require cars to achieve on a fleet average 35 mpg
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001. He said that would eventually save 2.8
million barrels of oil daily.
   The automakers have said they can't meet those goals without
making cars dramatically smaller and stopping production of midsize
and large vehicles.
   Bryan read statements by auto industry executives in the early
1970s predicting the demise of the family sedan as a result of fuel
efficiency requirements then under consideration.
   ``That just didn't happen. The six-passenger vehicle is here
just as it was before,'' said Bryan.

<TEXT>
   The Senate passed legislation Monday night
bringing older workers' job benefits under the protective umbrella
of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
   The bill, passed 94-1 and sent to the House, was aimed at
reversing the effects of a Supreme Court decision which held that
employee benefits were not covered by the 1967 civil rights law.
   Only Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, voted against the measure.
   ``This one Supreme Court ruling opened the door wide for
potential discrimination in older workers' health, disability, life
insurance and severance benefits,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``It did so by threatening or permitting the use of deferred
compensation in the form of pension benefits to be converted to an
unintended and counterproductive use,'' Heinz said. ``The Supreme
Court decision sanctions discrimination in benefits solely on the
basis of a worker's age, without regard to who the worker is or
what he contributes to the work force.''
   The legislation cleared the Senate floor after its chief
sponsors reached a compromise with opposition forces, led by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Hatch had voiced concern that folding employee benefits into the
coverage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 would
cause businesses to ``respond to this change by eliminating early
retirement incentive programs - programs that many older workers
find very attractive.''
   The bill puts the Senate on record as saying it intended the
1967 law to prohibit arbitrary discrimination against older
employees in the administration of benefit programs - unless
separate treatment of workers on the basis of age could be
justified.
   Heinz said that if the Supreme Court decision had been left
uncorrected by Congress, it could have led to ``premature exits
from office and assembly lines by some of America's most valued
employees.''
   The impetus for the legislation was the high court's ruling in a
suit involving June Betts, a Cincinnati-area woman, and Employees
Retirement System of Ohio.
   Ms. Betts was a speech pathologist in Hamilton County, Ohio. At
61, she became disabled with Alzheimer's disease, but was denied
disability retirement because she was over 60. The ruling denied
her an additional $200 a month.

<HEAD>Lockheed Rejects Simmons' Bid to Buy Another 10 Percent of Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

   Lockheed Corp. rejected Texas financier
Harold Simmons' latest advances on Monday, saying his attempt to
buy another 10 million shares of the company's stock was a ploy to
take control on the cheap.
   Simmons, who controls 19.8 percent of Lockheed's stock, lost a
proxy battle in March for control of the Calabasas, Calif.-based
company, the nation's sixth largest military contractor.
   He had asked Lockheed to void its ``poison pill'' takeover
defense. Under that provision, if anyone buys more than 20 percent
of Lockheed's stock, the company can sell new stock to other
shareholders at a discount. That would dilute Simmons' holdings,
making a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Lockheed's board rejected Simmons' request to revoke the
provision so his NL Industries Inc. can buy 10 million shares at
$35 per share from Lockheed's employee stock ownership plan or up
to $350 million worth of stock in the open market. That would give
him control of 35 percent of the stock.
   The directors did agree to suspend the poison pill if an offer
meets certain conditions: notably that it must be for 100 percent
of the company, be in cash, and be approved by a majority of
shareholders not counting the one making the offer.
   Reached by telephone in Texas, Simmons declined to talk about
Lockheed's decision. ``I'd really rather not comment until I've had
a chance to study the whole thing,'' he said.
   Like all defense contractors, Lockheed faces potentially tough
times from spending cuts by the U.S. government. Its stock closed
up a fraction Monday at $25.75, far below the average $43 per share
that Simmons paid for his stake.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said its directors had met
with Simmons several times since March to brief him about the
company.
   Simmons' Lockheed stock is now worth about $200 million less
than he paid for it. He maintains, however, that he is a longterm
investor with no intention of selling even if the stock price rose
sharply.

<TEXT>
   CBS and ABC, hoping to build new franchises with
news on weeknights, each announced plans Monday for late-night
newscasts.
   ABC's effort, which has yet to get final approval, is the most
ambitious.
   But CBS' half-hour show, co-anchored by Charles Kuralt and
Lesley tahl and starting at 11:30 p.m., will be the first to join
the late-night news wars. It will premiere Monday opposite ABC
News' ``Nightline'' series.
   ABC's pre-dawn broadcast, to run from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., will
start Jan. 7 if plans are approved, said ABC News vice president
Joanna Bistany.
   Earlier Monday, ABC said the newscast was definite. But that was
premature, Bistany said.
   Neither show has been given a title yet.
   Kuralt will anchor his part of the new CBS show here, and
continue as anchor of CBS' ``Sunday Morning'' newcast. Stahl will
anchor from Washington, and continue as moderator of ``Face the
Nation'' on Sundays.
   Like ``Nightline,'' which began when Iran held hostages in the
U.S. Embassy in 1979, the new CBS show is the outgrowth of a Middle
East crisis, Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. That crisis has been
examined in six CBS specials since Aug. 29, all called ``Showdown
in the Gulf.''
   Unlike ``Nightline,'' which usually tackles a single topic each
night, the new series will examine several topics each night
through live interviews, extended news segments, and essays, CBS
News said.
   It also will report the latest developments in the U.S. and the
Middle East as long as the Persian Gulf crisis continues, CBS said.
   Whether it will continue beyond January, when CBS is scheduled
to start late-night entertainment programming at 11:30 p.m.,
depends on how well it is received by viewers, CBS News president
Eric Ober said.
   But if it does well, he said, there is a possibility it will
continue in the 11:30 p.m. time slot, with the new programming
pushed up to a midnight start time.
   CBS currently shows repeats of ``Wiseguy'' at 11:30 p.m. EDT.
But those will start a half-hour later when the new CBS News
program begins.
   ABC's potential broadcast was created in response to requests
from the network's more than 200 affiliates, which now air
syndicated programs, movies, or go dark during the pre-dawn hours.
   With two anchors to be named later, the ABC broadcast would have
live and taped segments, domestic and international news, sports
and weather in 30-minute packages.
   The main competition for ABC's pre-dawn show would be the Cable
News Network. In January, NBC News will start a new operation, the
24-hour NBC News Channel serving that network's affiliates with
international, national and regional news for use in their local
newscasts.
   NBC said Monday the operation will be based in Charlotte, N.C.
   CNN has been considering the idea of a late-night interview show
like ABC's ``Nightline.'' But it has yet to make a decision.
   ABC's new series also will rival the far smaller ``All News
Channel,'' another 24-hour news service. Begun last November and
co-owned by Conus Communications and Viacom, it serves broadcasters
in 25 markets, Conus says.
   Although CBS News has had ``Nightwatch,'' a taped interview
show, competing in the pre-dawn hours since October 1982, its new
half-hour series marks its entry in a time period where
entertainment has flopped for years.
   Two years ago, CBS put Pat Sajak's talk show on at 11:30 p.m.,
facing NBC's late-night ratings champ, Johnny Carson's ``Tonight
Show,'' ``Nightline,'' and Arsenio Hall's syndicated show.
   But ``The Pat Sajak Show'' proved a ratings bomb and was
cancelled in April after 15 months on the air.

<TEXT>
   
   NEW YORK - The way skeptics tell it, the modern day R. H. Macy &amp;
Co. story wouldn't be fit for a feel-good Hollywood film. The
retailer, they say, may need something like divine intervention, if
not another miracle on 34th Street, to shoulder a heavy debt burden
while losing support from retail revenue. Not so, say executives of
the department store chain. They acknowledge that Christmas 1990
won't go down as one of the merrier holidays in history for the
industry. But Macy's can survive a consumer spending slump and will
prosper again, they say.

   LEBANON, Conn. - When Peter Sellew told his friends he planned
to breed Australian cashmere goats, they thought he was crazy. No
one in the state and only a handful of farmers on the East Coast
had ever tried to raise cashmere goats. ``Now they call up and say,
`How can we get some of those goats?' '' says the former publishing
executive-turned farmer. In 18 months, Sellew has built his stock
from five imported goats to a herd of nearly 100. This spring, he
expects to sell their precious cashmere fleece for up to $45 a
pound, compared to about 85 cents a pound for sheep's wool.
