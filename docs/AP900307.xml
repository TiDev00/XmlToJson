   A storm packing snow and freezing rain moved eastward across the
northern Plains on Wednesday after walloping Wyoming and Colorado
with their worst winter storm in years.
   About 130 miles of Interstate highway remained closed in Wyoming
late Wednesday night, and nearly 4,000 state employees in Cheyenne
who were told to stay home Tuesday were given Wednesday morning
off. More than 300 miles of highway in the state were closed
earlier.
   The storm dumped up to 50 inches of snow in parts of northern
Colorado and shut down travel from the Denver area to southeastern
Wyoming.
   In Colorado, a blizzard delayed an agent with the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who was driving to Crested Butte to
investigate a bank explosion that killed 13 people. His car skidded
on an icy highway and rolled over.
   The agent escaped injury, and his fellow investigators dubbed
him ``Crash.''
   In central Iowa, about 60,000 customers of Iowa Power lost
electricity Wednesday night due to an ice storm, which snapped tree
limbs, bringing down power lines. More than half the households in
the Des Moines area were without power, Iowa Power spokesman John
McCarroll said.
   More than 200 businesses and virtually all of the schools in
metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs and many northern Colorado
communities remained closed Wednesday or opened late.
   The fierce storm, driven by winds up to 50 mph, was blamed for
at least one traffic death in Colorado, and some highways were
still closed and littered with stuck and stalled vehicles Wednesday
morning.
   U.S. Highway 36 between Denver and Boulder resembled a parking
lot Tuesday night, according to the State Patrol.
   At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, nearly all airlines
voluntarily stopped flying Tuesday, forcing about 2,000 travelers
to spend the night at the terminal.
   During the height of the storm Tuesday, the Wyoming Highway
Patrol closed a number of roads, including about 200 miles of
Interstate 80 from the Nebraska border to Rawlins, and about 200
miles of I-25 from the Colorado border north to Casper. By
Wednesday afternoon, only a 110-mile stretch of I-25 had been
reopened from Wheatland to Casper.
   Colorado authorities closed I-25 and I-70, the two major
thoroughfares through metropolitan Denver, and I-76 to the
northeast, virtually closing off the city. Most were reopened
Wednesday, but I-25 remained closed from Fort Collins north to the
Wyoming state line.
   At midday Wednesday, snow still fell from central South Dakota
to western Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming and northern Colorado.
Freezing rain extended from north-central and eastern South Dakota
to southeastern Minnesota and much of Iowa. Rain fell to the south
and east from Texas to parts of Illinois.
   Hundreds of vehicles slid into ditches in Iowa, and many rural
schools were closed. Many schools in southeastern South Dakota also
closed.
   Snowfall in Colorado varied widely: 50 inches on Mount Evans, 44
inches in Coal Creek Canyon near Boulder and 3 inches at Colorado
Springs. Denver received 11.3 inches.
   Snowplows were out early and in force in Cheyenne, trying to
clear side streets and some main roads that were buried under 16
inches of snow, the most to fall on the city since a storm in April
1984 dumped 18 inches, according to the National Weather Service.
   The cleanup was expected to get easier Thursday, when
temperatures were expected to soar into the 50s.
   ``That's one of the pluses of having the storms here in Wyoming
in March and April,'' said meteorologist Jack Daseler. ``The sun's
up at a higher angle, it warms up quicker after (the storms), and
it's not so bad. It's not like getting one the last week of
December when the snow stays around for six or seven weeks.''
   In Linden, Texas, a 30-year-old employee of the state Highway
Department was killed Wednesday when a lightning bolt struck a
hoisted steel beam and electrified a chain he was holding,
authorities said. Linden is about 150 miles east of Dallas.

   ``The Bunny Hop'' has been banned on the
Granbury Queen Riverboat for fear the bouncy swing number will
capsize the dinner-cruise ship.
   The 74-foot paddlewheeler began bouncing around wildly on Lake
Granbury, near Fort Worth, one night last year. Owner Gary Miller
left the pilot house and rushed toward the main deck.
   ``I couldn't figure it out until I looked downstairs and saw
these people doing `The Bunny Hop,''' he said.
   The boat band still takes requests, but ``The Bunny Hop'' is
verboten, Miller said this week.

   An opposum with a punky orange hairdo has
museum officials stumped.
   Orange opossums are unheard of among experts, the museum staff
said Monday.
   ``We're sure she hasn't been dyed or anything like that,'' said
Holly Coovert, an assistant curator at the Dayton Museum of Natural
History. ``She's just orange.''
   ``We're trying to figure it out,'' said Tom Hissong, the curator
of education. ``All our veterinarians can figure is it's a genetic
defect.''
   The year-old opossum, known only as ``O.P.,'' was donated by a
family who raised her from infancy.
   ``They found two in the same litter that were orange,'' Ms.
Coovert said. ``One got loose later, and the family dog munched
it.''
   Hair samples from the possum have been sent for analysis to
state wildlife experts.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city whose political scandals have made
national headlines is teaching the tricks of the trade to Polish
officials seeking an American model for restructuring their
government.
   What might sound like a joke to some is part of a program aimed
at helping Poland implement democratic reforms in local government
after nearly half a century of Communist rule.
   ``Of all the problems Chicago has had with its reputation _ much
of it deserved _ as a place that has problems governmentally and
politically, it also has a lot of plusses,'' said Paul Green, a
political scientist at Governors State University in suburban
University Park.
   ``And if you want to see where the game's really played for
keeps, why go to someplace where they eat quiche?''
   Despite the Communist-led government's stunning defeat in last
June's elections, ``local government still remains in the hands of
the Communist apparatus,'' said Robert Repel, an aide to Mayor
Richard M. Daley
   Supporters of democracy hope to change that in elections set for
May. So three Polish reformers have come to the United States to
learn how democratic local governments operate.
   Chicago, one of several cities on their U.S. tour, was chosen
because it's Warsaw's sister city and has more Poles than any city
outside of Warsaw, Repel said.
   The reputation for crooked politics in the Windy City (so named
because of long-winded politicians of old) was ``not at all'' among
topics discussed, Repel said Tuesday, the final day of the Poles'
two-day stop in Chicago.
   The city instead gathered local authorities in various facets of
governing _ including finance, trade, crime and the courts _ to
share their expertise with the visitors.
   ``I'm certain that they are aware of all of the good things
about Chicago and all of the bad things about Chicago, but we're
not talking about political scandals, we're talking about some
governmental issues,'' Repel said.
   But scandals often have been an issue in Chicago. A century of
Democratic machine politics made influence-peddling and patronage
seem like part of the system.
   In recent years, as federal prosecutors have cracked down on
public corruption and reform has replaced machine politics, dozens
of crooked city officials have been sent to jail.
   One probe, code-named Operation Greylord, exposed the largest
judicial corruption scandal in the nation's history. Some 70
judges, lawyers and other court personnel were convicted of bribery
and related charges.
   ``We still have crooked local politics, it's just that the
politicians aren't as adept at stealing as they once were,''
Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko said in a telephone interview.
   That may be. Still, the Poles' visit coincided with a primary
election campaign that recently has been enlivened by FBI tapes of
an alleged mobster saying he had helped engineer Daley's election
last year as well as made payoffs to the Cook County Republican
chairman. Neither charge has been proved.
   But most Poles know virtually nothing about Chicago's political
reputation, said Wlodzimierz Kocon, one of the visitors.
   Kocon is a director at the Foundation in Support of Local
Democracy, a Warsaw-based group that is training candidates for
elections.
   ``Neither our economy nor our social system can change wthout
assistance'' from the United States and cities like Chicago, Kocon
said in a meeting with city officials Monday.
   Afterward, he politely declined to discuss Chicago's reputation,
but noted, ``We both have to learn from each other, as much as we
can.''
   And Chicago could be a good teacher, the sardonic Royko observed:
   ``We've gone from a very closed form of government to a very
open form of government and party loyalty is no longer a
prerequisite for a majority of city jobs ... and I assume (the
Poles) want to make party loyalty an unnecessary element. So this
is really a very good training ground.''

<TEXT>
   The message coming down the Milan runway for
the fall-winter 1990-91 is so clear it risks becoming monotonous.
   Short skirts and shorts, long jackets, parkas and duffel coats,
these are the staples of next winter's moda Milanese.
   In recent seasons, Italian designers have presented a varied
wardrobe for the modern woman who likes to make up her own style.
   Not this time.
   Most blatant is the total absence of below-the-knee hemlines.
The new length plays around the thigh in mini-skirts and bermuda
shorts. Anything longer looks positively dowdy, like the Basile
skirts, which _ mind you _ were several inches above the knee.
   For those who can't bear to bare their knees, the designers
present lots of pants, but they are all in stretch-fabric or knit,
also only flattering on a fortunate few.
   The alternative is to run around all day in evening gowns, the
only garment to safely cover the body from hip to ankle. And even
in this department, the selection is limited with many evening
outfits as short by night as by day.
   The new skirt is worn with a long jacket either slightly shorter
than the skirt or even with it. Sometimes the jacket is tailored,
at others it is free and swaying to create a bell shape that is
repeated in the wide sleeve.
   The other big theme of these collections is the parka or duffel
coat complete with hood, more often than not trimmed in fur _
ecological plush that is, real skins are definitely out of fashion.
   Copying from functional ski wear many of the coats have draw
string waists or hemlines to keep out winter chills.
   Even staid Genny and Basile, who showed their fall-winter styles
on Tuesday, opted for the short hemline and sporty parka look,
leaving their career girl clients in a bind.
   Genny showed a series of tailored suits in prim and proper
flannel that would have been great for the office if the hemline
and the jacket had not converged eight inches above the knee.
   Her trouser styles were pencil slim or pert bermudas _ both not
ideal for a long working day.
   Cozy parkas with a huge fur trimmed hood, were ideal for weekend
fun, but not a night out with the boss.
   Basile did keep the hemline down to only a couple of inches
above the knee, but he concentrated more on sportswear than city
life with plaid bermuda shorts, riding jackets and loads of gaily
colored duffel coats.

<HEAD>Increased Immigration to Israel Stirs Arab Concerns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The flood of Soviet immigrants into Israel
has roused fears among Arabs that the Jewish state will shun peace
efforts and seek more land for a rapidly growing population.
   They also worry about the improved East-West relations that made
the increased flow possible, and about the political revolution in
Eastern Europe.
   ``I don't think we've faced a more serious matter since the
1930s,'' when a massive Jewish immigration to Palestine took place,
Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem of Jordan told the weekly Star
newspaper last month.
   At least 300,000 Soviet Jews are expected to reach Israel in the
next few years because of the Kremlin's relaxed emigration rules.
They now arrive at the rate of about 1,200 a week.
   That will alter the Palestinian demographic equation that,
because of a higher birth rate, they eventually would outnumber
Jews in Israel as well as the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The emigration issue is only one consequence of the new detente,
which many Arabs believe seriously undermines their strategy
against Israel.
   Such long-time radical allies of Moscow as Syria and Libya
already feel the cooling in Moscow caused by political
liberalization and are edging back to the Arab mainstream.
   In what used to be the Soviet bloc, democratic governments are
replacing the rigid Communist regimes that backed the Arabs. Some
of the new governments have renewed relations with Israel, which
their predecessors broke in 1967.
   These developments have spurred efforts to forge a new Arab
unity. There is talk of reviving a military alliance of Iraq, Syria
and Jordan on Israel's borders.
   Kassem compared the mass Soviet emigration to 1948, when Israel
was born and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled to Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and Secretary-General Chedli Klibi of the Arab League
called the immigration a ``catastrophe.'' Kuwait's Cabinet said it
was ``flagrant aggression.''
   About 1 million Jews have applied to leave the Soviet Union and
Israeli officials say they expect about 300,000 to arrive in the
next three years. Israel's Jewish population now is about 4 million.
   In a statement to Israel radio last month, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said: ``Arabs oppose all immigration. ... For them,
the immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel is a sign of defeat ... in
their war against the state of Israel and Zionism.''
   Arabs see the mass influx as creating a stronger Israel less
willing to make peace on terms Arabs consider acceptable.
   ``Israel already stands as the major military power in the area,
so any increase ... is bound to worry us,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a
political scientist at the University of Jordan.
   ``We know there are something like 3 million Soviet Jews. We're
talking about the first stage of 1 million arriving. When will the
other 2 million arrive? Where will be the next jump?''
   He and other Arab analysts believe the latest wave of
immigration also could:
   _ Bring new Jewish settlers to the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
Golan Heights, all of which Israel captured in 1967. The return of
those lands is a key element in all Arab peace plans and most
others.
   ``This influx will make Israel more instransigent in denying
Palestinian rights to regain their lands,'' the United Arab
Emirates said.
   _ Increase Israeli pressure on Palestinians in the occupied
lands to move to Jordan, which could threaten the stability of a
nation bordering the two most important oil states, Saudi Arabia
and Iraq.
   King Hussein of Jordan said that fits what he described as plans
of Israeli hard-liners to make Jordan a substitute Palestinian
state.
   _ Deal another blow to the hope millions of Palestinians have of
returning to their homeland or creating a Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   ``Our own refugees, who have spent most of their lives scattered
around the world without a home, have the priority over Soviet Jews
to return to their homeland, Palestine,'' said a petition signed by
85 members of the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature.
   _ Revive an old fear that Zionists will achieve their dream of
gathering most Jews into Palestine, creating pressure for expansion
into areas of Lebanon and Jordan that Israeli religious extremists
consider part of the ancient ``land of Israel.''
   ``Israel has declared its expansionist nature and has proved
that nature,'' said Abu Jaber, the Jordanian political scientist.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's get-tough
move against her opponents was widely hailed as a welcome sign of
strength, but a Supreme Court rebuff and bloodshed in the north
raise doubts about skill in implementing the policy.
   Last week, the government filed rebellion with murder charges
against opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and six others in
connection with the failed Dec. 1-9 coup, in which 113 people were
killed.
   The filing of charges was widely praised by commentators and the
media, who recalled the generally mild treatment of conspirators
after some of the five previous coup attempts since Mrs. Aquino
took office.
   ``It's a welcome sign,'' said one Western diplomat, speaking
last week on condition of anonymity. ``It's about time she showed
toughness. The top priority for this government now is survival.''
   But in recent days, the strategy shows signs of unraveling
because of tactical blunders.
   At issue was a decision to indict Enrile and the others for
``rebellion with murder,'' a charge used by the late President
Ferdinand Marcos but which Mrs. Aquino nullified in 1987 as
``repressive.''
   Simple rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years imprisonment
and defendants are normally allowed bail. Rebellion with murder,
however, provides a life sentence with no bail. That would keep
Enrile and the others in detention even before the trial began.
   On Tuesday, however, the Supreme Court released Enrile and two
fellow defendants on bail, and a justice said the tribunal would
decide later on the validity of the dual charge.
   Presidential Press Secretary Tomas Gomez today said the ruling
``is neither a setback for the government, nor is it a victory for
Enrile because the main topic has not been decided'' _ the validity
of the charge.
   But during his week in custody, Enrile held frequent news
conferences, where he sought to portray himself as an aggrieved
underdog. He often told reporters he was praying for Mrs. Aquino,
whom he helped sweep to power in 1986, and thanked her for the
``free publicity.''
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, a lawyer and frequent administration
critic, said the government had tranformed Enrile ``into a martyr
and a hero.''
   Before leaving the police headquarters where he was held, Enrile
signed autographs for his jailers. They cheered when he told them,
``if you need anything, just come to my office.''
   ``Whoever was responsible for the misguided advice and ensuing
fiasco should ... perhaps consider offering their resignations,''
said The Manila Times, an independent daily.
   Compounding the problem is the public perception that evidence
against Enrile is weak. In the charge sheet, the government based
its case is based on statements by three waiters who claimed they
saw a coup leader, former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, at
Enrile's home on the first day of the December coup attempt.
   Enrile's lawyer, Renato Cayetano, claims he has 53 witnesses
ready to testify that Honasan was not there. The waiters did not
testify about any alleged conversations between Enrile and Honasan,
according to documents made public.
   ``We can only hope the government has sufficient evidence to
back up the charges,'' said the independent Philippine Daily
Inquirer. ``Otherwise, it would lend credence to the Enrile camp's
accusations that the senator was held on a spurious charge as part
of a grand political vendetta.''
   The decision to indict the seven on the controversial dual
charge may also have contributed to Sunday's bloodshed in
Tuguegarao, 250 miles north of Manila.
   Officials went to Tuguegarao, capital of Cagayan province, to
arrest suspended provincial Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, one of the
seven defendants. Aguinaldo told reporters he was willing to
surrender on rebellion charges but not murder because ``I didn't
kill anybody.''
   After four days of negotiations, Aguinaldo's followers seized a
hotel, taking Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo prisoner and trapping Local
Governments Secretary Luis Santos on the second floor.
   Florendo was killed when government troops recaptured the hotel.
Aguinaldo escaped with an estimated 200 armed followers. Mrs.
Aquino says Florendo was murdered by Aguinaldo's forces.
   ``Most lawyers believe that the situation in Cagayan would never
have ended in bloodshed if government prosecutors had not
`reinvented' the charge of rebellion complexed with murder,'' wrote
commentator Luis Beltran in The Manila Standard. ``Was it worth the
price just to show decisiveness and firmness?''

<HEAD>Postal Rate Hike: The Process is Under Way</HEAD>

   The U.S. Postal Service is beginning steps to
raise prices, even while conceding that the new rates may be ``too
much, too soon.''
   More expensive postage, including a 30-cent first class stamp,
is still nearly a year away thanks to a lengthy and complex
ratemaking process established by Congress.
   The mail agency is facing a deficit of between $1.4 billion and
$1.6 billion in this fiscal year, forcing it to begin the effort to
raise revenue. It is required by law to break even over time and no
longer receives any taxpayer subsidy.
   ``I think it should have been 28 or 29 cents, and we want to pay
that back to the American people. We want to improve service and
operate below the rate of inflation. We want that to be translated
into never again saying `too much, too soon,''' Postmaster General
Anthony M. Frank said Tuesday.
   ``We cannot ignore that increases in postal costs do occur, just
as they do in any business,'' said Robert Setrakian, chairman of
the postal service's board of governors, which proposed the rate
hikes.
   Setrakian estimated that the higher rates would cost the average
individual $10 to $11 annually.
   Frank said the rate increase is more than the inflation that has
occurred since the current prices took effect in 1988 because of
unexpectedly high costs.
   Productivity, although improving recently, didn't increase as
fast as expected, he said. In addition, costs were considerably
higher than planned, including employee health costs and the
requirement that the postal service contribute funds to help defray
the federal budget deficit in recent years.
   Those factors forced the agency to seek a 19 percent rate
increase to cover a period when inflation is projected to total
about 14 percent, Frank said.
   Opposition to higher prices came immediately from diverse
directions.
   The New York State Consumer Protection Board announced that it
will intervene in the rate case to oppose the plan.
   ``It is ludicrous to ask consumers to pay more for slower mail
service,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the commission's executive
director.
   The proposed increase is excessive and self-defeating, the
American Bankers' Association argued.
   ``Such postal rate increases imposed upon business ultimately,
in some fashion, will be paid by busness customers,'' said Vincent
A. Liguori, chairman of ABA's Postal Service Committee.
   ``The people are going to have to save the post office from
itself,'' said consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who proposed to set
up a grassroots organization of mail users.
   The planned rate hike is ``unreasonable and unjustified,''
charged Tracey Schreft of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   And Robert Kamerschen, head of ADVO System Inc., the nation's
largest advertising mailer, said he is concerned that raising rates
will drive profitable mail out of the postal system just at the
time it's needed most.
   The vote Tuesday by the postal board of governors was just the
first step in the process. The question now goes to the independent
Postal Rate Commission.
   The five-member commission has 10 months to consider the case.
It will hold hearings and solicit information from the postal
service, businesses and individuals.
   Following that, the commission will send a set of proposed rates
back to the postal governors. Often it agrees with the original
request, but not always.
   In 1984, for example, the postal service proposed a 23-cent
first class rate. The Postal Rate Commission cut that back to 22
cents. The governors accepted that decision.
   But they don't have to. If the governors can put together a
unanimous vote they can overrule the commission. That happened in
1981, when the governors raised the first-class rate from 15 cents
to 20 cents even though the commission said 18 cents would be
enough.

   The new rates proposed by the board of
governors of the U.S. Postal Service would mean higher mail costs
for most individuals and businesses.
   Here are some examples of the changes when the new rates take
effect, probably sometime in early 1991:
   _Individual cost of mailing a letter or paying a bill: 30 cents,
up from 25 cents.
   _Cost to mail a regular post card: 20 cents, up from 15 cents.
   _Price of sending a seven-pound package: $5.06, up from $4.00.
   _Charge to a bank to send a three-ounce statement: 76 cents, up
from 65 cents.
   _Department store cost to mail a pre-sorted bill: 26 cents, up
from 21 cents.
   _Price to send a credit-card bill, sorted according to the full
nine-digit ZIP code: 25.3 cents, up from 20.5 cents.
   _Utility company cost to send a bill with imprinted bar code,
allowing it to be handled by machines: 24.3 cents, up from 20 cents.
   _Lawyer's cost to send one-pound of legal documents by priority
mail: $2.75, up from $2.40.
   _Charge to send eight ounces of high-speed business information
via Express Mail: $9.75, up from $8.75.
   _Cost for two-pounds of urgent business materials via Express
Mail: $13.75, up from $12.00.
   _Postage for a typical weekly newsmagazine: 16 cents, up from
13.5 cents.
   _Cost of sending a somewhat heavier monthly magazine: 37.4
cents, up from 29.7 cents.
   _Postage for two ounces of advertising, with special bar code
imprinted to permit handling by new automated machinery: 16.1
cents, down from 16.7 cents.
   _Rate for half-pound catalog, sorted according to ZIP code: 33.1
cents, up from 27.1 cents.
   _Charge for advertising mail, sorted in advance according to the
sequence of houses that the letter carrier visits: 9.6 cents, down
from 10.1 cents.
   _Cost of sending a local three-pound business package: $2.00, up
from $1.58.
   _Book club cost to mail a four-pound package: $2,26, up from
$1.95.

   Major airlines improved in the number of
on-time flights and received fewer baggage handling complaints in
January, the government says.
   The Transportation Department, in its monthly Air Travel
Consumer Report, said Tuesday the largest domestic carriers
reported that 77.6 percent of their flights were on time in
January, compared with 70.2 percent in December.
   The January performance was also a slight improvement over a
year ago, when the on-time rate was 76.7 percent. Delays caused by
mechanical failures are not counted.
   Southwest Airlines had the best record for the month, with 82.5
percent on-time performance, and Eastern had the worst, with 70.7
percent.
   Reports of mishandled baggage averaged 8.7 per 1,000 passengers,
compared with 12.78 in December, which was the worst performance
since the department began the consumer report in 1987.

<HEAD>AMA Calls for Expanding Medicaid, Requiring Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association today
proposed revamping the nation's health care system by expanding
Medicaid and requiring employers to provide health insurance to
fulltime employees.
   The AMA's 16-point plan also would create state risk pools to
provide group insurance policies for the medically uninsurable,
small businesses and others unable to afford coverage under the
current system.
   The plan would cost about $60 billion, the AMA said, but it did
not suggest where the money should come from.
   The physicians' group said its proposals are aimed at offering
health care coverage to all Americans, regardless of income, and
preserving patients' freedom to choose their health-care provider.
   ``The individual's freedom of choice remains a cornerstone of
the American system,'' said Dr. Alan R. Nelson, AMA president.
   Revision in the current system is ``badly needed,'' Nelson said,
but ``it would be counterproductive to `fix' aspects of our system
that are not broken.''
   The AMA's proposal is similar to a $66 billion plan recommended
last week by the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health
Care, known as the Pepper Commission for its first chairman, the
late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   Both proposals are aimed at closing the gaps in the current
health care system.
   The nation's health-care bill is expected to reach $600 billion
this year, more than 11 percent of the gross national product. Yet
more than 33 million Americans lack health insurance.
   The highlights of the AMA plan include:
   _Expanding Medicaid to all people below the poverty level, and
establishing a uniform set of benefits. Medicaid now covers fewer
than half of those living below the poverty line, and eligibility
and benefits vary from state to state.
   _Requiring employers to provide health insurance for all
fulltime employees and their families, and eliminating
state-mandated benefits. Employers would be allowed tax deductions
to help with costs.
   _Establishing state risk pools to make coverage available for
the medically uninsurable and for others for whom individual health
insurance policies are too expensive and group coverage is not
available. About 15 states currently have such pools.
   _Expanding private sector coverage of long-term care with tax
incentives.
   _Revising medical malpractice laws to reduce liability insurance
costs for physicians and the practice of defensive medicine, such
as ordering tests and procedures that otherwise might not be
ordered.

   Congressional Republicans are renewing a
25-year-old fight to allow more older Americans to draw full Social
Security pensions even if they continue to work.
   Republicans say they will try to force repeated votes in the
Democratic-controlled House and Senate to get their way this year.
``We are going to vote on it over and over and over again,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   For the moment, the Bush administration is on the sidelines
because by some estimates the change would cost the Treasury about
$4 billion a year in lost taxes. Sponsors of the bill say the
government actually would end up with more money as former retirees
returned to the work force.
   The battle is over a provision that is as old as the Social
Security system itself. The ``retirement test'' or ``earnings
limitation'' restricts the amount of wages a person age 62 to 70
may earn without losing any Social Security pension.
   A person age 62, 63 or 64 may earn $6,840 a year without
penalty; for each $2 earned above that level, the person forfeits
$1 in benefits. A person who has reached 65 but has not yet turned
70 gives up $1 for each $3 earned above $9,360. There is no
restriction on those 70 and older.
   The GOP bill would repeal the earnings limitation for those 65
and older, as the party first promised in the 1964 party platform
on which Barry Goldwater ran.
   The limitation is ``a government-sponsored program to push
seniors out of the work force and into the rocking chair,'' Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas told a news conference
Tuesday. ``In my opinion, that's age discrimination of the worst
sort.''
   ``It is time that this Depression-era fossil was done away
with,'' said Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., chief House sponsor of
the bill.
   Hastert said 181 of the 435 House members have signed on as
cosponsors, as have 18 of the 100 senators. A big reduction in the
earnings limit was approved by the full House and by the Senate
Finance Committee last year but died in the Senate as part of a
deficit-reduction agreement.
   Democratic leaders have fought the repeal bill over the years
for two reasons.
   They note the first limit was placed in the law in 1939, even
before the first Social Security check was ever written, to ensure
that pensions went only to people who were retired.
   Secondly, congressional analysts say that repealing the earnings
limit would benefit only the wealthiest 10 percent of older
Americans.
   According to the House Ways and Means Committee, more than 8
million people age 65 through 69 received Social Security benefits
in 1986. Although one of every five beneficiaries had some earnings
that year, only 600,000 earned more than the limit and, thus,
forfeited part of their pension.
   ``It's an outdated idea that penalizes productive older
Americans who choose to remain in the work place,'' said Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.
   ``If we are serious about tax equity, this is the place to
start,'' said Rep. John J. Rhodes III, R-Ariz.
   Backers of the bill say the earnings limitation, in combination
with federal and state income taxes and Social Security taxes, has
the effect of pushing some older Americans into a 70 percent tax
bracket.

   Her best movies may be behind her and she's no
longer a congressional wife, but Elizabeth Taylor can still draw a
crowd on Capitol Hill.
   The movie star and outspoken advocate of more AIDS spending used
her celebrity appeal Tuesday to help promote a new bill that would
provide $600 million in emergency aid to care for people with the
disease.
   ``We need money _ we need lots of money, and we need it now,''
she said. ``Our cities and states are being choked by the enormous
cost of caring for AIDS patients.''
   She helped draw a crowd of television cameras and reporters to a
news conference at which Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, unveiled their bipartisan AIDS bill. Later, she was
the main witness at a House hearing on AIDS.
   ``It took Elizabeth Taylor to get you to one of my hearings,''
the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said to
Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
   Appearing with Taylor were lawmakers from both parties, leaders
on the AIDS issue and mayors including Democrats David Dinkins of
New York and Ray Flynn of Boston and Republican Dick Berkley of
Kansas City, Mo.
   The bill would provide $300 million in direct emergency
assistance to 13 cities with the worst AIDS problems. Another $300
million would go to states to develop comprehensive programs to
care for people with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Much of the urban aid would be directed at big city hospitals
which are swamped with impoverished AIDS victims. Kennedy said the
rest of the money would be aimed at small cities and rural areas,
now seeing the greatest increase in AIDS cases.
   Taylor, whose list of former husbands includes Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., is the founding chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
   She wore a dark green dress, her black hair swept high above her
ahead, and appeared to have put back on some of the weight she shed
in a well-publicized diet.
   Later, Taylor attended a White House dinner honoring Italian
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. She told reporters she had spoken
to Barbara Bush on Monday about AIDS. ``She's very informed and
very receptive. She knows a lot about the issue,'' the actress said.
   ``I came to Washington for AIDS. In a way it was kind of
therapeutic for me,'' the actress said, referring to the recent
death of her friend and companion, publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   The fuss over Taylor on Capitol Hill was noted by Belinda Mason,
a member of the National Commission on AIDS. While saying she
appreciated Taylor's appearance, she added:
   ``I think it's kind of sad we have to have Miss Taylor ... to
get the kind of attention this issue needs. I find that demeaning
as a person with AIDS.''
   Taylor said she was concerned that there was ``a very disturbing
resurgence of ignorance and misinformation'' about AIDS, including
the suggestion that AIDS affects only homosexuals, drug users, the
poor and minorities.
   ``Sadly, the darkest days of the AIDS crisis still lie ahead of
us,'' she said. ``Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the
balance unless we begin to confront AIDS as a true national medical
emergency.''

   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater will
undergo treatment for a benign growth on the right side of his
brain and his doctor says he should be back at work next week.
   ``No surgery is planned and we expect no difficulty with
followup treatments,'' Dr. Edward R. Laws said Tuesday.
   Mary Matalin, chief of staff at the Republican National
Committee, said it was ``business as usual at the RNC, except for
the fact that what used to be the chairman's office is now a flower
shop.''
   Matalin said Atwater ``has stayed on top of political
developments across the country and is eager to get back to work.''
   Laws, chairman of the department of Neurosurgery at George
Washington University Medical Center, said Atwater should be able
to resume ``a reasonable work schedule and normal activities next
week.''
   ``I've never led a normal life,'' an aide quoted Atwater as
saying.
   The hard-driving political operative collapsed Monday while
addressing a breakfast meeting of financial supporters of Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Tex.
   He was rushed to a hospital, and doctors performed a needle
biopsy Tuesday morning, a procedure in which a thin needle is used
to remove cells from the affected area.
   Laws did not specify the non-surgical treatment, but radiation
is commonly used in such cases.
   A native of South Carolina, the 39-year-old Atwater managed
President Bush's 1988 campaign and was the president's choice to
become chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Atwater met Bush in 1973. The South Carolinian came to
Washington to take over as executive director of College
Republicans. Bush was RNC chairman.
   Bush and two of his predecessors in the White House, Ronald
Reagan and Richard Nixon, were among those calling the hospital to
wish the chairman well.

<TEXT>
   An angry Mayor Teddy Kollek gathered his City
Council in a Jewish neighborhood built on the edge of Arab east
Jerusalem and criticized the United States for opposing Jewish
settlement there.
   The special meeting Tuesday was just the latest reflection of an
uproar that began three days earlier when President Bush said aid
to Israel could be affected by the Israeli government's policy of
settling Jews on captured land.
   That land includes east Jerusalem.
   For 23 years, Israel and the United States have disagreed about
the status of Jerusalem, a city fought over for centuries because
it is holy to Jews, Christians and Moslems.
   Although the United States and most other countries have never
recognized Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, U.S. presidents
have previously not challenged Israel's building programs there.
   The council resolution repeats Israel's stand that Jerusalem's
Arab eastern sector, annexed after its capture from Jordan along
with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, was part of ``the
eternal capital of the Jewish people.''
   ``Declarations that differentiate between the status of various
Jerusalem neighborhoods and prejudice the rights of (Jewish)
immigrants to come and live in Jerusalem ... do not contribute to
the overall peace process,'' it says.
   Kollek said he felt ``offended'' by recent American statements
about Israel's settlement policies.
   Since 1967, seven new Jewish neighborhoods have been built on
the fringes of east Jerusalem, which is home to about 150,000
Palestinians. An estimated 120,000 Jewish residents now live in
these ``suburbs,'' including about 15,000 in the Neve Yaacov
neighborhood where Tuesday's council session was held.
   More construction is planned, some to house the thousands of
Jews expected to immigrate here from the Soviet Union.
   The issue of Soviet resettlement has angered Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and in Jerusalem. They have been
rebelling against Israeli rule for the past 27 months in hopes of
establishing an independent state with Jerusalem _ known in Arabic
as al-Quds, or ``the holy'' _ as its capital.
   ``It is a question that is not subject to negotiations,''
Palestinian activist Sari Nusseibeh said in a telephone interview
Tuesday. ``East Jerusalem is the capital of the occupied
Palestinian state.''
   He added: ``The unilateral action of Israel having annexed it
does not change the historical facts and the political facts.''
   Nusseibeh, a philosophy professor whose family is believed to
have come to Jerusalem with the Arab conquerer Saladin in the 12th
Century, said he accepted Israel's demand that the city remain
undivided. However, he said, ``It could be a city with two capitals
or the seats of two capitals.''
   Such a compromise is ruled out by the Austrian-born Kollek, who
says it would lead to rebuilding the walls that separated Jews and
Arabs before 1967.
   ``Two capitals in one city would mean two laws, two police
forces, two customs courts,'' Kollek told reporters. ``Within no
time you would have the wall up again that we had before.''
   But Israel's capital is now in practice divided _ by the
Palestinian uprising.
   Before the revolt began in December 1987, Israelis went
regularly to shop on Saladin Street, the main Arab shopping area,
on the Jewish holy day of Saturday when virtually all shops in
Jewish west Jerusalem are closed.
   Now, few Israelis are seen in east Jerusalem on Saturday, or any
other day. Jewish cab drivers often refuse fares to the area, and
the government is building a new bypass road to allow residents of
West Bank Jewish settlements to get to their homes without going
through east Jerusalem.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial crunch on farmers during the
1980s left its mark on the major agricultural lenders by changing
their shares of the credit market, says an Agriculture Department
analyst.
   In 1980, the cooperatively owned Farm Credit System was the
giant among lenders with 44.1 percent of the market, followed by
commercial banks with a 31.3 percent piece of the action.
   But Doug Duncan of the department's Economic Research Service
said the two lenders ``nearly reversed their positions'' by 1989,
with commercial banks owning 40.6 percent market share while the
FCS dropped to an estimated 32.5 percent.
   The Farmers Home Administration, long known as the government's
lender of last resort to people denied loans by others, began the
decade with 14.6 percent of the market, rose to 20.6 percent in
1987 and probably wound up last year with an 18.7 percent share.
   Duncan, writing in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said ``only life insurance companies have retained a
fairly constant market share,'' which ranged between 8.2 percent
and 10 percent in the 1980s.
   Life insurance companies, he added, were the only ones of the
four lender groups that were relatively unaffected by direct
regulatory or legislative action during the decade.
   For example, the FmHA has seen its lending thrust changed from
direct lending to more guarantees for privately made loans. In
1980, 99 percent of the agency's farm loans was earmarked as direct
loans. By 1989, only 46 percent went to direct loans and 54 percent
to guarantees.
   Looking at the FCS, Duncan said the network of banks and
associations ``nearly collapsed in 1985'' but was saved by a series
of legislative actions culminating in the Agricultural Credit Act
of 1987.
   ``The act radically changed the structure of the FCS,'' he
wrote. ``It required district-level mergers between federal land
banks and federal intermediate credit banks, creating new farm
credit banks.''
   Further, the new credit banks were then allowed to merge across
the system's 12 districts to as few as six banks. The law also
permitted mergers among banks for cooperatives, and mergers between
federal land bank associations and production credit associations.
   More structural changes are anticipated as the system ``strives
to become more efficient and regain its market share'' of the loan
business, Duncan said.
   Commercial banks were deregulated at the federal level in the
early 1980s. As the decade progressed, many states relaxed their
regulations against branch banking, and interstate banking was
fostered.
   ``The farm- and oil-related contractions, combined with surging
bank failure rates and new failure resolution policies, led to
greater differences between large and small banks' performance,''
Duncan wrote.
   Nearly 1,600 banks, mostly small, went out of business between
1982 and 1989, and Duncan expects the trend to continue.
   ``Even though agriculture traditionally has been served by
small, independent banks, as of midyear (1989) the largest banks
held nearly one-quarter of commercial bank farm debt,'' he said.
``And the big banks are increasing their share.''

   Dry conditions still hung on in the northern
Great Plains, but rain and above-normal temperatures continued to
boost winter wheat prospects in the central and southern plains,
according to the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``In Kansas, crop condition was good except in the central and
north-central area, where soil moisture was still short,'' the
facility said Tuesday in its report for Feb. 26-March 4. ``Insect
and disease problems were very light.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover wheat and crop conditions but do
not include production forecasts.
   Relatively warm weather and ample moisture supplies hastened
wheat growth in Oklahoma, while the crop's condition was reported
good in Arkansas and fair to good in Missouri. Rain also helped the
Texas crop.
   But the report added, ``The northern Great Plains remained dry.
In Nebraska, winter wheat was fair to poor. Wind damaged fields in
the northern and western areas.''
   Wheat was ``breaking dormancy'' in eastern and southeastern
areas of Nebraska but were under stress from lack of moisture.
   ``In Montana, winter wheat was fair to good,'' the report said.
``Growth was good in California,'' although the numbers of Russian
wheat aphids continued to increase in the Sacramento Valley.
   Crop conditions were reported good to fair in Washington, while
in Oregon winter wheat was said to be fair in the east and good to
excellent in the western part of the state.
   ``In the Corn Belt and Southeast, winter wheat was fair to good,
with adequate moisture supplies,'' the report said. `` The crop was
breaking dormancy in portions of the Corn Belt.''

   The Agriculture Department says farmers who
participated in the 1989 corn and sorghum programs will get
subsidies totaling about $1.08 billion later this month.
   Most corn and sorghum producers requested advance payments at
the time they signed up in last year's program. Those included corn
payments of $2.6 billion and sorghum payments $250 million, John
Stevenson, acting executive vice president of the Commodity Credit
Corp., said Tuesday.
   Payments now due farmers include about $780 million in corn
``deficiency'' payments and $145 million in ``0-92'' payments, he
said. Sorghum producers will get about $120 million in deficiency
payments and $35 million in 0-92 payments.
   Deficiency payments are basically the difference between target
prices and market prices, or basic price support rate, whichever is
higher.
   Under the so-called 0-92 provision, wheat and feed grains
producers have the option of not planting on all or a portion of
their permitted acreage and still collect payments for up to 92
percent of their permitted crop acreage.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Multi-Phase Approach to Steer Kids From Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teaching children to stay away from drugs
requires a lot more than lectures from teachers, says national drug
policy director William J. Bennett. It takes tough school policy,
community involvement and law enforcement, too.
   ``This is not about lock 'em up,'' he said Tuesday in a speech
on drug education at George Mason University in suburban Fairfax,
Va. ``It is about establishing an environment in which good things
flourish and bad things don't.''
   Recounting a visit two weeks ago to a drug-infested Los Angeles
neighborhood where police barricaded certain areas and operated
street patrols with local residents, Bennett said crime decreased,
as expected.
   ``But something else happened, too _ something you might not
expect: school attendance went up _ way up. Perhaps as many as 200
additional students went to school once a police presence was
established.
   ``The police made it safe to go to school,'' he said. ``They
moved kids from the streets back into the classroom. If that isn't
drug prevention, then I don't know what is.''
   Some critics have said Bennett and the drug control strategy he
developed is too weighted towards law enforcement, with 71 percent
of the proposed $10.6 billion drug budget for 1991 devoted to law
enforcement and 29 percent to demand reduction, including education
and treatment.
   But Bennett said, ``Too many insist that our drug policy options
force us to choose between enforcement and education. That's wrong,
flat-out wrong.''
   The former education secretary said, ``Education can provide the
answer'' to turn young people away from drugs.
   But he said education must be well-rounded, and anti-drug
courses alone won't ``inoculate our children from the temptations
of drug use.''
   They must be included in a balanced program that stresses
resistance to peer pressure in a school that maintains rigid
anti-drug policies, Bennett said. And he said they will work if the
total effort _ in the school, at home and in the community _ is on
building character and self-esteem ``through hard work and
achievement.''
   Some mistakes have been made in past drug education efforts, he
said, and one is ``to pretend that what adolescents need most is
merely more information about drugs.''
   ``If anything, well-packaged information on drugs can even serve
to pique youthful curiosity about them,'' he said.
   ``Another mistake we have sometimes made is trying to scare
children with drug horror stories,'' he said. But many students
``are too skeptical to believe them or too smart and aware to be
persuaded that every drug encounter leads to fatal injury.''
   ``The most encouraging signs today come from drug education
programs that stress peer resistance: learning how to say no to
peers,'' he said.
   Tough school policies also play a strong role, he said, and the
best are those which suspend students and notify their parents if
they use drugs and which expel repeat offenders.
   ``Young people know hypocrisy when they see it,'' Bennett said.
``If principals don't walk it like instructors talk it, students
will walk it as they wish. ... Talking a good game is insufficient
to the task.''

<HEAD>Retirement of Top US Spy Plane Leaves Some Uneasy</HEAD>

   The SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, star of
American aerial snooping for 25 years, didn't look like museum
material on its record-setting final coast-to-coast flight that
took just over an hour.
   But it soon will be, to the regret of some admirers.
   ``This is one of the first victims of the effort to scale back
defense,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Tuesday after Blackbird
No. 17972 marked its retirement by whizzing from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C, in record time of 68 minutes, 17 seconds _ not
counting time for takeoff and landing. It also set four other speed
marks along the 2,404-mile route.
   The Air Force is donating the plane to the Smithsonian
Institution, which plans to display it here at the Washington
Dulles International Airport wing of the National Air and Space
Museum.
   The full Blackbird fleet was officially retired two months ago.
   Warner, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the Blackbird is still unmatched as a technological
wonder, but is being assigned to the junk heap because of a growing
perception in the United States that military spending must be
reduced as East-West tensions ease.
   ``I cannot honestly say this is a happy day for me,'' said Ben
Rich, the Lockheed Aeronautical System Co. executive who helped
design the black, dagger-shaped plane.
   Rich said he had only one parting sentiment: ``Bye-bye,
Blackbird.''
   Congress, in agreeing last fall with the Air Force's decision to
retire the twin-engine Blackbirds, said advances in technology
enable satellites to do similar work more cheaply than the spy
plane, which first entered service in 1964.
   Doubts about the decision remain.
   George Carver Jr., an intelligence specialist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a
telephone interview that he doubted the wisdom of ``giving up an
asset that has been extremely useful'' in providing intelligence
data.
   The Blackbird's coast-to-coast dash easily eclipsed the previous
time record of 3 hours, 38 minutes, set in 1963 by a Boeing 707.
   The spy plane took a running start, refueling over the Pacific
Ocean at 60,000 feet before heading east from the California
coastline and crossing its finish line near Salisbury, Md., said
Malvern Gross, president of the National Aeronautic Association,
which certifies aviation records.
   The Blackbird then refueled before cruising in to Dulles Airport.
   The flight also set three city-to-city speed records: 2,153.24
mph between Los Angeles and Washington; 2,242.48 mph between St.
Louis and Cincinnati and 2,200.94 mph between Kansas City, Mo., and
Washington. The pilot was Lt. Col. Ed Yeilding, and Lt. Col. J.T.
Vida was the reconnaissance systems officer.
   It was one of the few public displays of a Blackbird. And
despite the rush to publicize this final flight, most details of
the plane's design and capabilities are still top secret. The Air
Force won't even say how many of the planes exist.
   Maj. Suzanne Randle of the Strategic Air Command's headquarters
at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., said nine Blackbirds are going to
museums, three are being mothballed at Palmdale, Calif., and three
will be used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
for research. Ms. Randle said she could not say whether that
accounted for all the planes.
   The highflying Blackbird regularly flew missions over heavily
defended North Vietnam and provided intelligence in many other
regions, including the Middle East and China.
   The plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been
shot down. Built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees
Fahrenheit, its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum
used on most airplanes. It can sustain a speed of Mach 3, or three
times the speed of sound, but its maximum speed is classified.

<HEAD>House-Passed Bill Would Tighten FmHA Debt Collection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The farmer's lender of last resort, the
Farmers Home Administration, will be less lenient with delinquent
borrowers if a bill approved by the House becomes law.
   The House by voice vote Tuesday passed legislation that would
close loopholes in the 1987 Agricultural Credit Act that lawmakers
said caused abuse of the law.
   ``We've discovered some farmers have found loopholes big enough
to drive their tractors through,'' said Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C.
``Many of the abuses are downright scandalous.''
   The bill's author, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., emphasized,
``This is a very, very small number of people we are talking
about.'' But he said some of the abuses have been
multimillion-dollar in scale.
   The Senate is writing a similar bill under the leadership of
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., chairman of the agricultural credit
subcommittee.
   Conrad said he doesn't expect any major obstacles and believes
whatever difference might exist between the House and Senate
versions will be settled quickly in conference committee.
   House members said the measure was an effort to make a program
that was well intended work better.
   ``Since the act of 1987 became law it has helped thousands of
ranchers and producers,'' said Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., the
bill's cosponsor. ``These amendments will strengthen the act.''
   The National Family Farm Coalition, however, says the
legislation threatens the small farmer's existence. And the
National Farmers Union voted against the proposed changes at its
national convention in Oklahoma City on Monday.
   The credit act was designed to prevent FmHA from forcing family
farmers off their land if the government could make more money from
a restructured loan than through the foreclosure and liquidation
process.
   The options available to the deeply indebted borrowers have been
stretching out repayment, consolidating loans, reducing interest
rates, deferring payments and reducing the amount owed, known as a
writedown.
   Borrowers that FmHA finds cannot manage a restructured loan have
been able to keeps their property through a buyout, paying only the
net recovery value _ the appraised market value minus the amount
FmHA would have spent foreclosing on the property.
   However, both the congressional General Accounting Office and he
inspector general's office in the Agriculture Department, have said
that FmHA is vulnerable to even more losses than it already has
sustained if its loan-making and servicing procedures aren't
changed.
   The GAO says about half of FmHA's $23 billion outstanding loans
are owed by delinquent borrowers.
   The bill approved by the House and supported by the Bush
administration would:
   _Limit to $250,000 the amount FmHA could write down for any one
borrower.
   _Allow a borrower only one writedown and one net recovery buyout.
   _Let the FmHA consider all of the borrower's assets, except
those necessary for family living, when calculating a writedown.
Currently, the agency only considers the assets used in calculating
the original loan.
   _Extend from two years to 10 years the time that the government
has to collect profits made by farmers who sell their property
after buying out their loan at net recovery value.
   _Require borrowers to act in ``good faith'' as defined by FmHA
regulations to be eligible for net recovery buyouts.
   _Extend the time periods in which borrowers may apply for
restructuring, in which FmHA must process these applications and in
which borrowers may exercise the option for a net recovery buyout.

<TEXT>
   Conservative civil rights official Clarence
Thomas is set to become a federal appeals judge after winning
Senate confirmation despite criticism from senior citizens and
liberal groups.
   ``I believe he will be an excellent judge,'' Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo., said after the Senate confirmed Thomas on Tuesday
on a voice vote.
   Danforth, who led the confirmation drive, said the Senate
``recognized in Clarence Thomas ability, accomplishment and
dedication to justice.''
   The Senate as late as Monday night had planned to take a roll
call vote on Thomas but called it off after it became obvious that
it would be lopsided.
   The 41-year-old Thomas becomes a judge of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which because of the
high-profile cases that come before it is sometimes called the
nation's second highest court behind the Supreme Court.
   His outspoken criticism of hiring quotas and affirmative action
programs as chairman of the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission
over the last eight years has won praise from conservatives.
   Liberals, however, were often critical of Thomas, one of the
most visible black officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Danforth and other supporters stressed that Thomas rose the hard
way from a poverty-ridden farm in rural Georgia to Yale Law School
graduate and prominent federal official.
   They also stressed what they described as his proven legal
ability.
   Critics complained that the statute of limitations on thousands
of age-discrimination cases lapsed with no action taken while
Thomas was in charge of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   They said he failed to cooperate with congressional
investigations of these lapses. When Thomas at his confirmation
hearing sought to blame state and local fair-employment commissions
for these lapses, critics said he apparently did not know that
these bodies were regulated by his own agency.
   While critical of Thomas on that point, the American Association
of Retired Persons did not take a formal position on whether the
Senate should confirm Thomas.

   Soldiers led by the defense minister
joined with Moslem guerrillas Tuesday to try to overthrow
Afghanistan's government and diplomats said fighting continued in
the country's capital on Wednesday.
   Kabul radio had reported Tuesday night that the rebels were
defeated by troops loyal to President Najib. But Western diplomats
said mutinous Afghan air force pilots were still bombing loyalist
positions in Kabul Wednesday morning.
   ``There was also a lot of heavy anti-aircraft fire to drive them
away,'' said one diplomat.
   A second Western diplomat said efforts to contact people in
Kabul on Wednesday had been difficult: ``It seems they are all
hunkered down in their bunkers and that means there must be
shooting in the streets of Kabul.''
   Both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Afghanistan's U.N. envoy, Noor Ahmad Noor, said in New York on
Tuesday that security forces were searching for the defense
minister, Maj. Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai. Noor told reporters at U.N.
headquarters that Tanai was believed to be in hiding in the Kabul
vicinity.
   Shortly after Tanai launched the coup attempt, fundamentalist
Moslem rebel leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar offered his support.
   Abdul Haidi, a spokesman of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami rebel
group, told The Associated Press on Wednesday ``We are getting news
from the Kabul wireless that the fighting is still going on.''
   He claimed Tanai's forces controlled the airport but were under
heavy rocket fire from troops loyal to Najib. Haidi said Moslem
insurgents intercepted a radio broadcast between Tanai forces at
the airport and others from a base within the capital.
   A Radio Kabul broadcast Wednesday morning, monitored in
Islamabad, claimed government troops were in control of the Defense
Ministry, where Tanai had earlier been reportedly orchestrating the
coup attempt.
   The broadcast also urged government loyalists to arm themselves
and report to the nearest ruling party headquarters in the capital,
``in order to guarantee the security of the people.''
   In the Soviet Union, which sponsors the Najib government, the
official news agency Tass had reported that the coup attempt was
crushed Tuesday. It claimed fighting had abated by nightfall and
Najib's forces were firmly in control.
   Western diplomats, guerrilla leaders in Pakistan and the Soviet
media reported heavy fighting Tuesday and said Afghan air force
planes had bombed Arg Palace, Najib's headquarters in the heart of
Kabul.
   Heavy artillery and tanks fired for hours on the buildings of
the Defense Ministry and the army's main political directorate,
Tass said. It also reported shelling of residential districts, but
said they abated after dusk.
   U.N. Ambassador Noor reported ``very, very limited'' civilian
casualties and said the number of people involved in the coup was
said to be ``very small.'' Most rebels gave up and only ``a very
limited number were killed,'' he said.
   Tanai, a hard-line Marxist, was linked to at least of two of the
five previous coup attempts reported against Najib, who took office
in 1986.
   Najib said on state television Tuesday night: ``Some soiled
elements today tried to carry out a conspiracy and provoke
bloodshed, but the government forces have neutralized them. They
have been suppressed.''
   Repeating a message broadcast earlier in the day by Interior
Minister Aslam Watanjar, who was named to replace Tanai, Najib
urged Afghans to help capture the general ``dead or alive.'' He
said mutinous soldiers who surrendered by 4 a.m. Wednesday would be
given amnesty.
   Ahmad Sarwar, Afghan ambassador in New Delhi, said he spoke with
Najib by telephone Tuesday night and the president sounded ``very
strong and very confident.''
   ``He said everything is under control,'' said Sarwar, whose wife
is a sister to Najib's wife. He said Najib told him one group of
Tanai's followers had been killed and another captured.
   Najib did not say when the fighting started or mention where he
was when the telephone contact was made, Sarwar said.
   According to a source, Sarwar said, some of Tanai's supporters
bombed Kabul from the air, but no bombs fell within half a mile of
Najib or Arg Palace.
   Tuesday's attempted coup was the third said to involve Tanai and
Hekmaytar.
   Hekmatyar, a 42-year-old engineer, has broken with the
guerrillas' exile gpvernment formed a year ago in neighboring
Pakistan and has been accused by other resistance groups of killing
rival guerrillas and innocent civilians.
   He is among the most anti-West leaders of the seven insurgent
groups, but has received the bulk of U.S. weapons during the
12-year-old civil war in Afghanistan.
   Tanai, a leader of the coup that installed a Marxist government
in April 1968, is said to have had many contacts with the Moslem
guerrillas.
   Reports circulated in July that Tanai and Hekmatyar were
conspiring to overthrow Najib. The alleged coup plot was uncovered
and Tanai was either detained or put under house arrest briefly,
according to later reports.
   The general, believed to be in his 40s, has opposed Najib's
peace overtures. Najib has made various offers to the guerrillas in
an attempt to end the civil war, but to no avail.
   In December, the government arrested 127 people who allegedly
were planning a coup. Tanai was implicated but never charged, and
was said to have spent weeks under house arrest.
   On Monday, 124 of those arrested went on trial in Kabul,
including senior army officers. The other three were released.
   Hekmatyar told reporters Tuesday in Islamabad he supports any
attempt to oust Najib. If a coup succeeded, he said, the guerrillas
would decide whether to negotiate for an Islamic government or
fight Najib's successor.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov was asked
in Moscow Tuesday what action the Kremlin would take if Najib was
overthrown. He replied: ``We will just have to wait and see.''
   The Red Army entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help fight
the war. The last Soviet forces withdrew on Feb. 15, 1989, but the
Kremlin continues to provide massive aid.

   Protected by security guards, Greyhound
replacement drivers set out before dawn for a day on the open road
in their rolling classrooms.
   The course on how to drive a bus is one of four training
operations set up by Greyhound a month ago in anticipation of the
strike begun Friday by 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance workers
at America's only nationwide bus company.
   A guard blocked access to visitors Tuesday at the out-of-the-way
motel parking lot from which the buses left. A mechanic directed
visitors to Room 155. There, a man with a Greyhound ID tag denied
any training was going on.
   Finally, in the room next door, a man wearing a Greyhound tie
pin _ who like the others refused to identify himself _
acknowledged that this lot 30 miles south of Richmond was the site
of one of the training operations.
   The trainees undergo a 21-day program of classroom work and
behind-the-wheel experience, the unidentified Greyhound employees
said. On Tuesday, the training buses were rolling to Charleston,
S.C., a 10-hour trip with stops along the way in 22 small towns.
   Liz Hale, a spokeswoman at company headquarters in Dallas, said
the trainees have at least one year of experience in driving large
trucks or buses.
   But some strikers said the regimen was inadequate compared to
the 12-week course Greyhound normally provides.
   ``As much as I hate my ex-wife, I wouldn't let her get on a bus
driven by one of these replacements,'' said a picket wearing a
``Scab Watcher'' hat outside the Richmond terminal this week. He
refused to give his name.
   Greyhound estimated 700 replacement drivers are at work and
claimed on Tuesday to be running at 34 percent of its normal
routes. An additional 300 drivers graduate this week, and some
union drivers have crossed picket lines, Hale said.
   The company has received 6,500 applications to replace strikers,
Greyhound said. But 50 to 60 of the new drivers had quit in the
first day or two of the strike because of intimidation by strikers,
company officials said.
   ``We are not surprised by that,'' said another Greyhound
spokesman, George Gravley. ``These people were recruited and they
were told honestly and forthrightly ... the nature of the work.''
   Greyhound officials in Dallas would not disclose the training
locations, but The Associated Press learned training was going on
here and at Indianapolis and Sacramento, Calif. The fourth training
location was not immediately known.
   Chairman Fred G. Currey said over the weekend that Greyhound
Lines Inc. has millions of dollars in reserve, and the advance
training plans appeared to be a sign the company was girding for a
long struggle with the strikers.
   The replacements are being hired under the contract terms the
strikers rejected, including some pay increases contingent on
increased ridership, safety records and other productivity factors,
Gravley said.
   In Indianapolis, striking drivers shivered in the cold Tuesday
as they watched replacements learning to drive. Half a dozen
security guards walked the perimeter of the training lot.
   Striker Noah N. Young, who has been driving a bus for 35 years
and is 2{ years away from retirement, said Indianapolis was
selected as a training center because ``it's a small union center.''

<HEAD>D'Amato Asks Agencies to Copy Him in on Reporters' Searches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, under scrutiny by the
Senate Ethics Committee, is asking federal agencies to send him
copies of any documents concerning him that have been released
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The request, which an official at one department said could
result in a ``paperwork nightmare'' if granted, was made last month
in a series of letters the New York Republican's office sent to the
14 Cabinet departments and several other agencies.
   D'Amato's press secretary, Franklin L. Coleman, who signed the
letters, said the intense local media scrutiny D'Amato has received
in recent months has often included questions about correspondence
no longer quickly available to the senator because it has been sent
to archives.
   ``We made this request in order to be in a position to respond
promptly and accurately to inquiries regarding correspondence our
office generated to agencies in the past,'' Coleman said Tuesday.
   The letters, on Senate stationery, said D'Amato's office has
received inquiries about correspondence and indications that
similar requests for the documents had been filed with government
agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.
   ``Senator D'Amato will, as always, want to be as responsive as
possible to the media,'' the letters said. They asked that whenever
documents mentioning or concerning the senator were released,
``copies of that material also be provided to the senator
simultaneously.''
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter sent to the
Federal Election Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials said HUD had received an identical request.
Coleman later confirmed sending the letters to all the major
government departments and independent agencies.
   The ethics committee is conducting a preliminary inquiry to
determine whether it should begin a trial-like investigation of a
series of allegations made against D'Amato by Mark Green, his
Democratic election opponent in 1986.
   Green filed the complaint after numerous news accounts detailed
the senator's successful lobbying of HUD officials for housing and
other developments in New York and Puerto Rico, including a
$425,000 grant to pay for a swimming pool in D'Amato's hometown of
Island Park, N.Y. The pool project was canceled after a spate of
bad publicity.
   In several cases, the developers who received D'Amato's support
were friends or major donors to his campaigns.
   Another allegation stemmed from a letter that D'Amato's brother,
attorney Armand D'Amato, drafted in the senator's name to obtain
information for a client, Unisys Corp., concerning a $100 million
defense contract.
   Sen. D'Amato said he did not know about the letter and also has
said that several letters to HUD officials bearing his name were
signed by staff without his knowledge.
   In November, D'Amato said he was the victim of a ``pile on'' by
the media, adding: ``I have nothing to be ashamed of.''
   Coleman said Tuesday he ``took it upon myself'' to write the
letters to the agencies and did not tell the senator in advance.
   He said he was not aware of any responses to the letters.
   Fred Eiland, spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, said
the FEC probably would deny the request on he ground it doesn't
meet the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act because it
does not ask for a specific document or documents.
   Although Coleman's letter was not filed as an FOIA request,
Eiland said the commission had decided to treat it as such.
   Eiland also said it was office policy to treat confidentially
any media requests for research assistance. ``We never, ever tell
another person what someone else is looking at,'' he said. ``It's
between us and the reporter.''
   HUD has asked its legal staff to review what one agency official
said were ``potentially troubling'' questions raised by D'Amato's
request.
   Under review was whether the department should grant such an
open-ended request for copies of FOIA responses and, if it decided
to comply, whether HUD should identify the reporter or organization
requesting the information.
   The HUD official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
that if the department complied with the request it could receive
similar letters from other members of Congress, reporters and
others, ``opening the door for a paperwork nightmare.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers, Group Push to Make Low-Income Housing Credit Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tax credit that encourages corporations to
invest in low-income rental units is the ``only game in town'' to
help ease the housing crunch for the poor, a lawmaker says.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., made that assessment Tuesday at a
news conference called to dramatize the need to make the Low Income
Housing Tax Credit permanent.
   The Chicago-based National Equity Fund, a conduit for corporate
investments using the credit, said it used the endangered tax
credit last year to invest $77 million in rental housing for 2,000
families.
   Thirty-five corporations, including banking and insurance
giants, invested the money. It will be used as a lever to provide a
total of $200 million worth of housing in 15 cities, the fund said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., have introduced legislation to make the tax credit
permanent.
   ``Tax policy has had a negative effect by and large in the
1980s,'' said Danforth, referring to the impact of tax policy on
low-income housing programs. ``It's time to turn it around.''
   The credit was made part of the 1986 tax overhaul and was
extended last year to the end of 1990. The Bush administration has
proposed an additional one-year extension.
   ``It's really sad you have to use the income tax system'' to
drive a social program, Rangel said, ``but it's the only game in
town.''
   The equity fund is an affiliate of the Local Initiatives Support
Corp., a private, non-profit group dedicated to community
development that was created by the Ford Foundation in 1979.
   The first partnership created under the fund's auspices invested
$14.25 million from 13 corporations to create 857 housing units.
The fund said it raised $51 million from 40 corporations last year
to develop more than 2,000 units worth over $150 million.
   The credits, awarded over 10 years, create 100,000 units of
low-income housing each year, it said.
   The fund is involved in projects in Boston; Cincinnati;
Hartford, Conn.; Healdsburg, Calif.; Indianapolis; Kalamazoo,
Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles; Miami; Minneapolis; Newark,
N.J.; New York; Philadelphia; Raleigh, N.C.; and St. Paul, Minn.
   Corporate investors are: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph; Aetna
Life &amp; Casualty; American Express; Ameritech; Bank of America; Banc
One Mortgage Corp.; Bankers Trust New York Corp.; CBS; Capitol
Cities-ABC; Chase Manhattan Bank; Chemical Bank; City National

<HEAD>UPI Seeks Arbitration of Photo Dispute with Reuters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International is seeking
arbitration of its claim that the Reuters news service has deprived
it of photo revenue for the past five years.
   UPI is seeking damages of more than $600,000 for money it says
was lost when some of its customers began buying photos from
Reuters instead.
   UPI filed its request for arbitration on Tuesday with the
International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration in Paris,
which will handle the case through an affiliate in New York.
   The news service said Reuters is obligated under agreements
between the two companies to reimburse UPI for any revenue lost as
a result of UPI subscribers shifting to Reuters' photo service.
   A Reuters spokesman, Robert Crooke, said there is no evidence
UPI lost money due to his company's marketing activities.
   ``We welcome the opportunity that the arbitration provides to
establish not only that Reuter activities are not the cause of
UPI's losses but that those causes lie much closer to UPI's own
actions,'' Crooke said.
   Under an arrangement that began Jan. 1, 1985, and was supposed
to run for 10 years, UPI provided Reuters with pictures from the
United States while Reuters supplied pictures from other countries.
   Reuters said Feb. 16 it was canceling the agreement and halted
its flow of pictures to UPI for more than four hours.
   A U.S. district judge in New York issued a temporary restraining
order barring further such action by Reuters. The court has
scheduled a hearing Monday on UPI's request for a preliminary
injunction against Reuters' attempts to end the photo arrangement.
   Reuters has alleged that UPI's photo service has declined since
the exchange began.

<HEAD>East German Workers Win Right To Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German workers have won the right to
strike for the first time in their country's 40-year history under
a new labor law that also prohibits employers from locking out
workers.
   The law, overwhelming approved Tuesday by Parliament, comes as
the country lurches ever closer to reunification with West Germany.
   Legislators praised the new labor code for its mixing of
market-style reforms with traditional socialist protections. But
they conceded that it probably would be objectionable to West
German investors and employers.
   The law easily won approval from the 385 lawmakers present for
what is expected to be the last session of the 500-member People's
Chamber before the country's first competitive elections on March
18. Only six voted against the measure, with 53 abstentions. Debate
was minimal.
   The future of the new law may rest with the new, 400-member
Parliament. Many labor principles embodied in the law require
implementing legislation that will have to be tackled after the new
legislative body is seated.
   The strike clause, however, is among changes to take effect next
week.
   Lawmakers hailed the no-lockout clause as a workers' right not
enjoyed in West Germany.
   Because the law is likely to be seen as imbalanced by West
German industries seeking to build plants or engage in joint
production operations in East Germany, it may serve to slow the
investment considered essential to turning around the flagging
economy.
   The law comes in the form of a constitutional change. It permits
unions to call strikes if arbitration fails to resolve
labor-management differences in negotiations.
   Strikes have been forbidden in East Germany and most other
formerly socialist states, with labor unions traditionally
powerless to challenge the Communists who ruled until democratic
upheavals toppled them last year.
   The government now will have the right to intercede and stop a
strike only if the walkout is deemed a threat to public order.
   The law provides that ``no one can reduce or hinder unions in
their rightful occupation.''
   Communist lawmaker Kaethe Niederkirchner said such a broad
protection was likely to disturb the capitalists next door. He
quoted West German employers association president Klaus Murmann as
describing the law as a ``hindrance'' to inter-German economic
cooperation.
   Parliament also adopted additional measures on election
procedures, including extending voting rights to foreigners who
have lived in East Germany for two years or more.
   The changes are the latest since a popular uprising forced
Communist hard-liner Erich Honecker to step down in October, the
opening of the Berlin Wall a month later and the introduction of
non-Communists and opposition democratic reformers into the interim
government.

<HEAD>Ritter Drew $140,000 From Trust Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter, founder of Covenant
House, has admitted drawing $140,000 from a tax-exempt fund set up
to benefit runaways.
   The priest, who resigned under pressure last week as president
of the nation's biggest network of runaway shelters, told The New
York Times in a story today that he contibuted the money to the
fund and took it out to cover his expenses and conduct his ministry.
   The fund's trustee, Edmund J. Burns, told the Times the $140,000
was given to the Roman Catholic priest's Franciscan Order. But
Ritter told the Times the money actually went to him.
   Ritter said he had authorization from the Franciscans to use the
money for personal expenses.
   The Franciscan Order said it did not know of the trust,
according to the Times.
   Ritter said he eventually redeposited in the trust some of the
money the trust had paid to him, and told the Times all the
transactions were legal. He said he began depositing $60,000 of his
$98,000-a-year salary in the trust in 1986 to avoid criticism of
his high pay.
   But Robert Kobel, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service,
said that under the law, a person cannot give money to a trust with
the idea of taking it back.
   Ritter has been accused of other financial improprieties and
four young men have alleged in published reports that he had sexual
affairs with them.
   The state attorney general's office is investigating
transactions involving the trust, and Covenant House's board of
directors told Attorney General Robert Abrams the trust would be
dismantled.
   On Tuesday, the Times reported that the trust was not registered
with the state and that funds from it had been used to make loans
to two Covenant House board members and Ritter's sister.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge, Dollar Rises Sharply in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
Wednesday, while the dollar was sharply higher against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 428.74 points, or 1.27
percent, ending the day at 33,362.34. It had dropped 54.12 points
Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 150.75 yen, up 1.25 yen from Tuesday's
close at 149.50 yen. It opened at 150.25 yen and ranged between
150.25 yen and 150.98 yen.
   Discouraged by the yen's weakness, the benchmark 10-year No. 119
Japanese government bond price fell to 86.67 points as of 3 p.m.,
down 0.41 points from Tuesday's close at 87.08. Its yield rose to
7.200 percent, up from the previous day'a 7.115 percent.
   ``This is a triple-low situation ... with declines in all the
markets _ stock, foreign exchange and bonds,'' said Masayoshi Yano,
a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   Yano said the yen's decline, as well as renewed speculation over
a rise in the nation's discount rate, discouraged many investors.
   Japan's leading economic newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, said
the Bank of Japan will raise its official discount rate from the
current 4.25 percent by as much as one percentage point as early as
next week.
   Market players have expected the central bank to raise its key
lending rate since shortly after the nation's general election last
month. Analysts have blamed uncertainties and speculations
involving the rate for recent plunges in the stock market.
   Yano said computer program-aided arbitrage selling, mainly by
foreign securities firms accelerated the Nikkei's drop Wednesday.
Arbitrage is a technique of trading in the stock and futures
markets simultaneously to profit from price differentials between
them.
   Program trading has been blamed aiding recent declines, though
foreign brokers have denied it has had a significant effect on the
market.
   Shortly after the Nikkei fell 1,569.10 points Feb. 26, the Tokyo
Stock Exchange requested that securities firms limit program
trading to the opening minutes of the morning and the afternoon
sessions until Thursday.
   ``As the deadline approaches, nobody seems to be following the
request,'' Yano said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained strong following its
surge on overseas markets, dealers said.
   The dollar surpassed the 150-yen line in Sydney before Tokyo
market opened, and it rose further as speculative Japanese
investors bought dollars and sold the yen, said Koichiro Amaya, a
trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar's surge halted when it neared 151 yen as the Bank of
Japan was seen intervening in the market. Traders said the bank
sold about $1 billion in the morning session in an effort to halt
the dollar's further rise. The bank does not officially comment on
its market interventions.
   ``But the dollar is strong, and there is nothing to encourage
dollar-selling, except for the Bank of Japan's intervention,''
Amaya said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Europe's revolutionary changes and
Mikhail Gorbachev's commitment to lifting the Iron Curtain have
prompted scientists to set back the so-called Doomsday Clock.
   But those who set the clock at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
back four minutes Tuesday _ from six minutes to 10 minutes before
midnight, or nuclear destruction _ pointed out that nuclear weapons
exist in alarming numbers.
   ``The likelihood of a full-scale nuclear holocaust has been
reduced,'' said Leonard Rieser, chairman of the Bulletin's board of
directors, before moving the minute hand on the bronze 18-inch
instrument that hangs in the magazine's headquarters at the
University of Chicago.
   The 21 directors, 41 sponsoring scientists and editor of the
Bulletin voted on the question of changing the clock in
mid-January. Only four said the clock shouldn't be changed, while
two wanted it set even farther from doomsday.
   Tuesday's move marked the eighth setting of the clock in its
43-year history.
   ``Most Americans have thought of the Cold War as a permanent
facet of international relations,'' said Gloria Duffy, a board
member and president of Global Outlook, a Palo Alto, Calif.,
security research institute. ``They never expected it to change in
their lifetime.''
   Dr. Michael McCally, a University of Chicago doctor, was among
those opposing change. ``My concern is with the weapons''
proliferation, he said.
   The clock came closest to midnight _ just two minutes away _ in
1953, after the United States successfully tested the hydrogen bomb.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it
has agreed to advise governments of Eastern Europe on how to keep
their infant stock markets orderly and honest.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who has met recently with
high-level financial officials from the Soviet Union, Hungary and
Poland, announced Tuesday that Wall Street watchdog agency is
forming an Advisory Committee on Emerging Securities Markets in
Eastern Europe.
   ``The SEC's expertise in this area hopefully can assist in a
successful transition to efficient private capital markets with
necessary oversight and supervision,'' said Breeden.
   The committee will recommend what action the SEC and the
financial industry can take to help create organize securities
markets in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Breeden and other SEC officials met Feb. 21 with a high-level
delegation from the Soviet government that was reviewing the
operation of U.S. banking and securities markets.
   Breeden has held similar meetings with delegations from Poland
and Hungary. The SEC anticipates receiving additional requests for
assistance from several other governments in creating securities
markets.

<HEAD>Government Warns of Cushions for Infants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says parents should not let
infants sleep on small pillows or cushions filled with plastic foam
beads because 10 babies using the items have suffocated in two
years.
   However, the Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to
identify the products or companies Tuesday, saying negotiations for
a recall were continuing.
   At least 10 infants have died since December 1987, with seven of
the deaths occurring since June, the commission said. All of the
victims were 3-months-old or younger.
   The agency said it was unusual for so many deaths associated
with a relatively new product to occur over such a short period.
   The cushions, which became popular items for infants over the
past few years, are supposed to be a comfort for babies because
they adjust to the contours of an infant's body, government
officials said.
   The cushions, about 24 inches long and 12 inches wide, resemble
pillows or small ``bean bags,'' the agency said. Usually made from
quilted fabric, the cushions are loosely filled with plastic foam
beads or pellets.
   The commission, which urged parents not to leave children on the
pillows unattended, said it believes the products are made and sold
by at least 10 companies.

<HEAD>Nation's Population Reaches 250 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are now a quarter-billion people in the
United States.
   This nation started life with just under 4 million people, about
as many as now live in metropolitan Boston.
   On Tuesday it reached 250,000,000, according to estimates by the
Census Bureau.
   A more detailed total will be calculated following the national
head count to be taken April 1.
   The 250 million estimate is a 10.4 percent increase from the
226.5 million Americans counted in 1980.
   The U.S. population reached 50 million in 1880, doubled to 100
million by 1915, was 150 million in 1949 and climbed to 200 million
in 1967.
   Projections by the Census Bureau indicate the nation could reach
300 million within 30 years.
   Current population growth is estimated at one new person every
14 seconds in the United States. That is based on a birth every 8
seconds and a new immigrant arriving every 35 seconds, balanced by
a death every 14 seconds and a departure every 3 minutes.
   The United States ranks fourth in the world in population,
following China, at 1.1 billion; India, at 833 million, and the
Soviet Union, at 289 million.
   Following the United States are Indonesia, 188 million; Brazil,
151 million; Japan, 123 million; Nigeria, 115 million; Bangladesh,
115 million and Pakistan, 110 million.

   January was the warmest on record in the
United States, following one of the coldest Decembers.
   The average temperature in January was 37.2 degrees Fahrenheit
in the 48 contiguous states, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported this week.
   That's the warmest January since uniform record collection was
started in 1895, according to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center
in Asheville, N.C.
   The relative warmth was felt most strongly in the region that
includes parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Wyoming and Nebraska, the
agency said. But readings were above normal across nearly all of
the nation except the Southwest.
   That warmth came hard on the heels of the fourth coldest
December on record, a month when bitter cold was felt even in
Florida, the agency noted.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Not Counting on Plea Bargain With Senator</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf to CORRECT spelling of anonymity</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is not counting on
plea-bargain negotiations with Sen. David Durenberger and plans to
move ahead with trial-like proceedings, according to sources
familiar with the case.
   One source, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday the committee would not be placing its ``main focus'' on
the hearings if serious negotiations to settle the case were under
way.
   No date has been set for the hearings, sources said, because the
committee is still conducting a preliminary investigation into
Senate reimbursements Durenberger received for a condominium he
partly owned.
   The committee set the stage last week for the hearings, when it
formally notified the Minnesota Republican there was ``substantial
credible evidence'' of five specific rules violations and a sixth
governing general conduct expected of a senator.
   Durenberger, who has admitted mistakes in judgment but no
willful wrongdoing, ``may have'' violated outside income limits and
other rules in his promotion of two books he wrote, the committee
said. He also potentially violated annual limits on receipt of
gifts when he accepted nearly $5,000 worth of limousine trips for
personal travel in 1985 and 1986, the panel said.
   The committee is in the final stage of the Durenberger
investigation, which normally would end with a determination of
whether rules were broken. A guilty finding could lead the panel to
recommend disciplinary action to the Senate, including censure,
loss of seniority or expulsion.
   Durenberger, however, could decide at any time that he wants to
negotiate a settlement rather than defend himself at a trial-type
hearing.
   A plea bargain would likely involve an admission by Durenberger
that violations took place and would short-circuit the final phase
of the probe. It could end the case without a recommendation from
the committee to the Senate.
   Durenberger's spokeswoman, Carrie Collins, had no comment on the
senator's defense strategy.
   Under ethics committee rules, the panel must give Durenberger
``an opportunity'' for a hearing ``before it recommends
disciplinary action'' to the Senate.
   However, one source said the committee is planning to go ahead
with the hearing, whether Durenberger requests one or not, because
it is ``in the public interest.''
   The panel announced Feb. 22 that ``the committee is continuing
its preliminary inquiry'' on reimbursements Durenberger received
for rent on a Minneapolis condominium he partly owned.
   To include the condominium arrangement in the trial-like
hearing, the committee would have to find ``substantial credible
evidence'' of a violation.

<HEAD>Ortega Scores U.S. Efforts at Demobilizing Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega says that as
one of its last acts his outgoing Sandinista government will
abolish a news censorship law and allow the establishment of
private television stations.
   Speaking Tuesday before U.S. and Latin American publishers at a
meeting of the Inter American Press Association, Ortega said he
would introduce a bill in the National Assembly to repeal the much
criticized censorship law.
   Ortega and his leftist Sandinistas were beaten Feb. 25 by the
14-party United National Opposition coalition led by Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   Abolishing the censorship law _ one of Ortega's last acts in the
National Assembly as president _ would allow either the
Sandinistas, UNO, or others to start up a televison station. TV
broadcasting is now in government hands.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the only opposition newspaper, La
Prensa, championed turning over government control of television
during the Sandinistas 10{-year rule.
   A law passed in April 1989 ended prior restraint of news and the
right to indefinitely close newspapers and radio stations, but it
maintained the government's TV monopoly.
   The law also kept up punishment for ``altering'' state press
releases or publishing information contrary to the interests of
Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Despite Intervention, Stocks Plunge in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen today in
Tokyo despite active intervention by the Bank of Japan, while the
chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped.
   The dollar closed at 150.75 yen, up 1.25 yen from Tuesday's
close of 149.50 yen. It opened at 150.25 yen, its low for the day,
and ranged as high as 150.98 yen.
   The dollar rose from its opening level as market players
predicted the Bank of Japan would not raise its official discount
rate in the near future, traders said.
   ``Many market players now think that the central bank will put
off the hike because it could hurt the stock market badly,'' said
Kenzo Shinomiya, a trader with Fuji Bank. Higher interest rates
tend to depress stock prices.
   Analysts have said a discount rate hike could be unwise because
of a series of recent declines in the stock market. The 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average, the main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
has lost 5,124.79 points, or 13.2 percent, so far this year, mainly
due to uncertainties over the discount rate increase and to
computer-linked trading.
   Shinomiya said few people except for the Bank of Japan and a
small number of profit-takers were selling the dollar. ``Demand for
the dollar is very strong, and it will rise as high as 155 yen,''
he said.
   Discouraged by the yen's weakness, the price of benchmark
10-year No. 119 Japanese government bonds fell to 86.67 points as
of 3 p.m., down 0.41 points from Tuesday's close of 87.08. Their
yield rose to 7.2 percent, up from the previous day'a 7.115 percent.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index fell 428.74 points, or
1.27 percent, ending the day at 33,362.34. It had dropped 54.12
points Tuesday.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshio Inoue blamed the drop in stock
and bond prices on the yen's weakness.
   ``It's all because of the discount rate, which has not risen
despite investors' expectations,'' he said.
   Market players have expected the central bank would raise its
official discount rate after general elections last month, and
analysts have blamed the market's recent decline in part on
uncertainties over the key interest rate.
   ``The discount rate hike has gradually been factored into the
market, but the problem is its timing,'' Inoue said.
   ``This is a triple-low situation ... with declines in all the
markets _ stock, foreign exchange and bonds,'' said Masayoshi Yano,
a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   He said a front-page story today in the financial newspaper
Nihon Keizai Shimbun saying the Bank of Japan would raise its
official discount rate from the current 4.25 percent by as much as
1 percentage point as early as next week discouraged stock
investors.
   Inoue said the index, which fell even farther in the morning,
remained low as individual investors continued to sell issues while
very few participants were buying.
   Dealers attributed the index's early decline to program-aided
arbitrage selling initiated by foreign securities firms such as
Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and Shearson Lehman.
   ``The last day for futures issues due in March is scheduled for
tomorrow. So I expect continuing arbitrage selling until the end of
tomorrow,'' Yano said.
   Arbitrage is a technique of trading in two markets, for example
spot and futures, simultaneously to profit from price differentials
between them.
   Computer-aided arbitrage selling has been blamed for recent
market plunges, although foreign brokers have denied that the
technique has had a significant effect on the market. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange requested, shortly after the Nikkei's 1,569.10-point
fall Feb. 26, that securities firms limit their arbitrage deals to
the opening minutes of the morning and the afternoon sessions until
Thursday.

<HEAD>Police: Officers Shot Themselves in Drug Shootout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two undercover officers wounded in a shootout
with drug dealers were hit by police fire _ one man from his own
gun _ and investigators may never know whose bullet killed a third
officer, authorities say.
   The gun battle took place Monday at a housing project during a
cocaine buy involving two dealers.
   ``Right from the get-go, it was a ripoff,'' a police spokesman,
Inspector Richard Mayronne, said Tuesday. He said it was clear it
was a ripoff because the room into which one of the detectives was
taken had no way out.
   State Police Investigator Joseph T. Aversa, 31, was slain. Two
city detectives, Craig Moruzzi, 41, and Joseph Mendez, 29, suffered
leg wounds.
   The three were members of the New York Drug Enforcement Task
Force, which includes city, state and federal officers.
   Authorities and police sources said Aversa's fire struck
Moruzzi, and that Mendez shot himself in a struggle with one dealer
for control of the detective's gun.
   ``We can't determine who hit Aversa,'' Mayronne said. ``It's
very possible'' investigators never will find out, he added.
   Authorities did not rule out the possibility that a stray police
bullet killed Aversa. They said their investigation was hampered
because the bullet, which entered Aversa's left eye and exited
behind his ear, was not recovered.
   David Hernandez, 20, and Oswaldo Santana, 27, were arrested
Monday in the afternoon gunfight and charged with murder, attempted
murder and robbery. Juan Jose Peralta, 23, was arrested Tuesday on
cocaine charges in the case.
   Santana was shot in the toe, Hernandez in the elbow and abdomen.
His injuries were not considered life threatening.
   Mayronne refused to say how many bullets were fired during the
gunfight.
   The New York Times today quoted unidentified high-ranking
officials as saying the three officers fired a total of 12 shots,
while between them, the two suspects fired one. The Daily News said
the officers fired 14 shots.
   Hernandez was the only one of the dealers who was armed, police
said.
   Authorities said the shootings occurred when the dealers tried
to rob the officers during a cocaine buy-and-bust. Detectives had
negotiated earlier to buy more than four pounds of cocaine for
$46,000, authorities said.
   ``It's extremely risky at both ends of the spectrum because when
you buy drugs, you're going into the mouth of the tiger,'' said
Assistant Police Chief John Hill, head of the department's
narcotics division.
   ``It's dangerous, but it's the main tool in our arsenal. Very
successful.''

<HEAD>Thousands Protest FDA's Ban on Haitian Blood Donations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Haitian-Americans protested the new
federal ban on blood donations by Haitians, saying the AIDS
prevention policy would increase discrimination against them.
   After the rally by about 8,000 people Tuesday, the Food and Drug
Administration responded by promising to consult with
Haitian-Americans and convene a public meeting of its Blood
Products Advisory Committee to discuss the issue.
   The Haitian immigrants gathered in a dusty field across from FDA
offices here, chanting ``F-D-A _ Racists,'' waving red-and-blue
Haitian flags and carrying signs saying ``FDA bigots must go.''
   Police arrested three people when the crowd surged onto FDA
property.
   ``Anyone can die from AIDS _ from the president to the poorest
man. I don't see why they blame the Haitians,'' said Jean Francois,
a college student.
   The policy announced last month is designed to help keep
AIDS-tainted blood out of the nation's supply by requiring blood
banks to refuse donations from people who were born in or who
emigrated from Haiti and sub-Saharan Africa.
   Protesters claim the policy unfairly lumps them with the other
groups discouraged from giving blood: intravenous drug users,
homosexuals and prostitutes.
   ``This is an acquired disease. It's behavioral,'' said Philomena
Jadotte, 24, a nursing student who emigrated from Haiti 10 years
ago. ``There are more Hispanics dying of AIDS in Miami than
Haitians. Why are we being singled out? Because we're black.''
   Many Haitians already feel unwanted in South Florida because of
U.S. immigration policy that welcomes Cuban and Nicaraguan emigres
but returns most Haitians to their impoverished, violent homeland.
   A previous ban permitted blood donations from Haitians and
sub-Saharan Africans only if they emigrated before 1977. But the
FDA changed its policy after research cast doubt on the reliability
of that date as an indicator of when the disease began to spread
outside the United States, said FDA spokesman Brad Stone.
   Unlike other groups, most Haitians who have AIDS got the fatal
disease through heterosexual transmission, and Stone said there's
no good way to screen potential carriers from the rest of the
Haitian population.
   Local officials in 1988 said that about one-third of the black
sufferers of AIDS in Florida were born in Haiti.
   ``We hope that people won't unfairly stigmatize
Haitian-Americans as a result of this policy,'' Stone said by
telephone from Washington.
   ``We'd like to find ways to refine the process, so we could ask
questions and screen out those who would be at higher risk.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Survives Recall Election Over Indian Fishing Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RHINELANDER, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker easily fended off a
recall attempt by opponents of spearfishing rights for Wisconsin's
Chippewa Indians.
   Rep. James Holperin, the first state lawmaker to face a recall
since 1932, won 9,535 votes or 69 percent to 4,380 or 31 percent
for businessman Gene Ahlborn in the special Democratic race Tuesday.
   Holperin still faces Brian Sherren, a resort owner, in a recall
election April 3. Sherren, 40, ran unopposed in the GOP primary and
garnered 601 votes.
   Ahlborn, 50, conceded defeat and said he was ``extremely happy.
I certainly wasn't looking for a job.''
   ``It was a referendum on treaty rights and if that's what the
people want, I guess I can live with it,'' he said. ``It looks to
me like they want to roll over and play dead.''
   The recall campaign was the work of groups opposed to Indian
spearfishing, a right that was granted to the state's Chippewas in
19th century treaties with the U.S. government. A 1983 federal
court ruling also gave the Indians rights to cut timber, hunt and
gather food off the reservation.
   Spearfishermen harvest the fish each spring as the spawn. It is
an extremely efficient fishing method, and outdoorsmen and those in
the tourism industry fear it will reduce the population of walleyed
pike for sports fishing.
   The issue has caused years of unrest in northern Wisconsin. Last
April and May, hundreds of sportsmen showed up at lakes during the
three-week spearfishing season. Some threw rocks or shouted ethnic
slurs at the Indians.
   Holperin, 39, a former radio and TV newscaster, was elected to
the Assembly in 1982.
   Organizers of the recall were especially critical of his support
last year for Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's plan to pay a
Chippewa band $50 million in cash and other aid over 10 years to
curtail exercise of their treaty rights. Tribal members voted down
the plan.
   Dean Crist, a spokesman for Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, the
anti-spearfishing group that circulated the petitions for recall,
said his group had not supported either candidate in the race.
   ``The purpose of STA was to send a message that we were
unhappy,'' Crist said.
   In Wisconsin's last recall election, 58 years ago, Republican
Sen. Otto Mueller retained his seat.

   May _ Radio Kabul announces that Najib, former head of the
secret police, is replacing President Babrak Karmal, who was
demoted to revolutionary council head.
   December _ Najib meets Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow and
announces a national unity government will be formed to include
Afghans living in exile.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1987:
   January _ Najib offers rebel fighters a cease-fire and expands
his national reconciliation program to include rebel groups. Rebels
reject the cease-fire as a trap. They also reject Najib's national
reconciliation plan, promising to fight until he is toppled and an
Islamic government is established in Kabul.
   April _ Najib claims to have established national reconciliation
commissions in 1,681 villages, representing about 6 percent of the
villages in Afghanistan.
   September _ Talks in Geneva aimed at finding a political end to
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan adjourn without agreement.
   November _ Najib proposes a 12-month timetable for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, saying Moscow has
given it approval.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1988:
   January _ Afghan and Soviet troops break a five-week rebel siege
of the eastern Afghan garrison town of Khost. Najib said the
victory was proof of his troops' strength.
   February _ Gorbachev offers to withdraw his troops beginning May
15. Najib says he's confident of surviving without direct Soviet
military help.
   March _ President Reagan promises the U.S. commitment to
anti-communist rebels won't end with the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.
   April 14 _ The foreign ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan
sign a United Nations-brokered accord providing for the withdrawal
of about 103,000 Soviet combat troops from Afghanistan within 10

   May 14 _ Several thousand Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan's
second largest city, Kandahar, and return to the Soviet Union,
marking the start of the negotiated troop withdrawal.
   December _ Najib convenes a grand council and proclaims himself
president.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1989:

close their embassies in Kabul. Najib says the closures are an
attempt to undermine his government's ability to withstand a rebel
onslaught following the final withdrawal of Soviet soldiers.
   Feb. 15 _ The last Soviet soldier crosses the Friendship Bridge
linking Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, ending nine years of
direct military intervention by Moscow.
   February-March _ Najib's troops defend Afghanistan's eastern
city of Jalalabad against a rebel offensive. His success defies
earlier predictions that his government would crumble after the
Soviet troop withdrawal.
   April 27 _ Najib stages a Revolution Day parade a day early
after learning that a faction of the army planned to kill him.
   May 20-21 _ Najib convenes another council to extend a state of
emergency imposed following the final Soviet troop withdrawal.

<HEAD>Contras Insist Sandinista Army Must Go</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Contra leader insisted after
talks with a representative of Nicaragua's new government that the
Sandinistas cede control of the country's military before the
rebels quit their fight and return home.
   The statement Tuesday by Oscar Sovalbarro, chief of the Contra
team discussing the rebels' eventual demobilization, came hours
after outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said any attempt
to include Contra officers in the army ``would unleash a national
war.''
   The leftist Sandinistas say the army's revolutionary nature and
role is enshrined in the constitution, and that the constitution
must be reformed before the army can be changed.
   The U.S.-backed Contras accuse the Sandinistas, who which lost
the Feb. 25 presidential and legislative elections, of scheming to
retain power by refusing to hand over military command.
   ``What we're saying is that for there to be true reconciliation
in Nicaragua, it is important that the military forces be disarmed.
The army that exists in Nicaragua is not a national army. It is the
army of a political party, and it must disappear,'' said
Sovalbarro, who commented after a meeting between Contra commanders
and an aide to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   The rebels also issued a statement accusing the Sandinista air
force of ``indiscriminate'' bombing of eight villages in the
northwestern province of Nueva Segovia. They accused the
Sandinistas of ``trying to convince the people of Nicaragua and
world opinion that these are defensive operations'' against the
Contras.
   The Sandinistas earlier Tuesday had accused Contra forces of
attacking Sandinista positions in northern Nicaragua.
   Jaime Cuadra, Mrs. Chamorro's representative, described the
talks as preliminary and said no accord on demobilization was
reached.
   The date for demobilization of 4,000 Contras inside Nicaragua
and thousands more in Honduran camps has emerged as a major
stumbling block to a peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua.
   ``We support Dona Violeta and she will decide after April 25
what to do with the Sandinistas and what to do with the armed
forces,'' Sovalbarro said.
   Sovalbarro and Pepe Matus, legal adviser to the Contras,
outlined what they said was a Contra proposal that could lead to
demobilization.
   They suggested Contra forces should march, with their weapons,
from their Honduran camps to Nicaraguan ``enclaves,'' which they
would occupy under international supervision.
   ``We see that as very favorable, as it provides a solution to
the problem of occupation of Honduran territory,'' said Sovalbarro.
   Honduras has been a reluctant host to the Contras in recent
years. President Rafael Callejas said last week the rebels should
leave as soon as possible.
   The United States, which helped form the Contras in the early
1980s and sustained them through the decade, said last week that
immediate measures should be taken to achieve the Contras'
demobilization. But the State Department also said the rebels must
enjoy ``full guarantees'' regarding personal and economic security
before disbanding.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who has pledged to end the draft and cut back the
size of the military, on Tuesday called for a demilitarized Central
America.
   In a meeting in northern Costa Rica with its president, Oscar
Arias, she called for his support for regional demilitarization.

   The slaying of a Texas Racing Commission
official shot to death with his wife and two children at their home
has been ruled a suicide.
   But police said they have not yet determined whether 41-year-old
David Joost also killed his wife, Susan, 35, and their children,
ages 10 and 5.
   Medical Examiner Robert Bayardo on Tuesday said that Joost, who
handled administrative duties for the Racing Commission, died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. All four victims died
early Sunday, he said.
   Sheriff Paul Hastings said no suicide note had been found but
that the pressure of Joost's job may have led him to kill himself.
   ``He basically had an extremely difficult job,'' the sheriff
said.
   Sheriff's spokeswoman Rachel Vasquez said officials could not
confirm whether the same .38-caliber handgun killed all four family
members.
   ``The case is still under investigation, so all we can assume at
this point is that we have three homicides and one suicide,'' Ms.
Vasquez said.
   Joost's body was discovered Monday at his home in Buda, outside
Austin, after he failed to show at a commission meeting. Mrs. Joost
worked for the surface mining and reclamation division of the Texas
Railroad Commission.

<TEXT>
   Wyoming was under a blanket of heavy snow today as were Colorado
and much of the Northeast, which braced for continued cold.
   A storm moving out of the Rockies and onto the Plains blasted
Wyoming and Colorado with heavy, wet snow Tuesday, closing schools
and hundreds of miles of highway and shutting down the Wyoming
Legislature.
   Winter storm warnings went up in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and
South Dakota. Advisories for freezing rain were posted today for
Minnesota, and snow advisories were up across the Cascades in
Washington state and Oregon.
   By late Tuesday afternoon, Wyoming had 16 inches of snow at
Wheatland, 13 at Cheyenne and 12 at Douglas. Nebraska snowfall
included 8 inches at Harrison and Bushnell. Colorado had 14 inches
at Monument and 10 at Fort Collins.
   The Wyoming Highway Patrol closed some 200 miles of Interstate
80 from the Nebraska line west to Walcott Junction, and about 150
miles of Interstate 25 from the Colorado line north to Orin
Junction.
   Denver's Stapleton International Airport reported delays in
arrivals and departures because of visibility as low as 1,000 feet.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, stranded by a blizzard en route to a
meeting of business leaders in Boulder, delivered his speech by car
phone.
   ``The only thing we need to have a healthy economy in this state
is to have a freeway system that works right,'' Romer joked on
Tuesday from his car, which was stuck on a snowbound highway near
Broomfield.
   Snowfall diminished over New York state and New Jersey, after
producing 2 to 5 inches of snow Tuesday. Snow lingered in
Massachusetts Tuesday night, as well as in Wyoming, Colorado, South
Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.
   Freezing rain extended from Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota.
Rain and a few thunderstorms reached across parts of Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. Rain also extended over the Pacific
Northwest with rain changing to snow in the mountains.
   Today's forecast called for rain across the Northwest with snow

<HEAD>Vermont Town Votes to Keep Alcohol _ But Get Rid of Board Member</HEAD>

   Residents of this New England town voted to
keep alcohol _ but get rid of the board member who wanted to turn
the place dry.
   Settling the score Tuesday on an issue that had led to a
fistfight between two selectmen and intensified a 12-year feud
between two families, the town voted 269-111 to allow Rupert's only
general store to sell beer and wine.
   The Green Mountain town was one of hundreds of northern New
England communities holding town meetings, the late-winter
democratic ritual in which residents speak their mind on matters
from snowplow routes to school policy.
   In Vernon, neighbors of Vermont's only nuclear plant voted
Monday to support a low-level radioactive waste site near the
plant. Vermont is the only state with a nuclear power plant that
has no place to put such waste.
   In the coastal Maine town of Penobscot, residents overwhelmingly
rejected a plan Tuesday to abolish local property taxes and finance
town services instead through voluntary payments and user fees. The
town budget is $1.2 million a year.
   Residents felt ``if you didn't have to pay, if you just ask your
conscience, the town would crumble,'' said Royce Perkins, architect
of the no-tax plan. He said the vote was approximately 235-15
against the proposal.
   In Rupert, with a population just over 600, a rejection of
alcohol sales would have forced residents to travel six miles or
more to buy their beer and wine and made the town one of only six
dry communities in Vermont.
   The town was dry until voters in 1981 narrowly approved the sale
of beer and wine.
   But many felt the real issue on the ballot had more to do with
the family feud than the issue of wet vs. dry.
   ``It's really just a grudge match,'' said Rupert Selectman Jay
Wilson Jr., who had pushed for an end to beer and wine and ended up
losing his 32-year seat 221-156.
   He said the feud began when John Pelton charged that Wilson's
son, now town road commissioner, and several of his friends were
taking gasoline from the town garage for their personal use. Pelton
is the owner of Rupert's only general store.
   Pelton is not the only one feuding with the Wilsons.
   Edward Lewis said his road is the last to get plowed by Wilson's
son because he has challenged the elder Wilson for the selectman's
seat.
   The Rev. Paul Mychack of the Church of Christ said some
residents have ``been against me mindlessly'' because he took
another of Wilson's sons to court 11 years ago.

<HEAD>New York Chancellor Proposes Schools in Office Buildings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's schools chancellor wants to set up
elementary schools inside office buildings so youngsters can learn
with their parents nearby.
   Joseph A. Fernandez touted the plan Tuesday as a way to improve
employee performance and attendance while easing school
overcrowding and integrating classes in the nation's biggest school
district, with about 1 million students.
   Fernandez set up similar ``satellite learning centers'' in 1988
while he ran the Miami school system.
   The school system would supply teachers while the company would
provide the space for classes of at least 25 children, from
pre-kindergarten through second grade, at each workplace.
   ``It's conceivable that in a satellite learning center you could
have the vice president's kid sitting next to the janitor's kid,''
he said. ``It's also conceivable you could get some of our middle
class to start bringing back their kids to our schools.''
   Fernandez, who hopes to have a pilot program going by September,
said that at the first such center, a kindergarten at a Miami
insurance company, employee turnover dropped from 11 percent to 4
percent within a year.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Charges Against Agent Leaked to Sabotage Promotion
Hearings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is harassing a decorated agent with
allegations of espionage to sabotage an investigation into
anti-Hispanic bias at the bureau, the agent's attorney says.
   Fernando Mata is on paid leave with his security clearance
revoked but has not been advised of any charges, his lawyer, Hugo
Rodriguez, said Tuesday.
   Mata, a 15-year FBI veteran in counterintelligence who received
the Justice Department's top award in 1983, has undergone repeated
polygraph exams about his career since being suspended six weeks
ago, said Rodriguez.
   The test results have been favorable for Mata, the lawyer said
said.
   The New York Times reported Monday that Mata was being
investigated for unauthorized contacts with Cuban agents.
   Rodriguez said he could not discuss specifics of the allegations
against Mata because he is under a national-security gag order. But
he said, ``Fernando Mata is not a spy. They know that, everyone
knows that.''
   The FBI would not comment other than to say: ``This action is
totally unrelated to agent Mata's participation in a discrimination
class-action lawsuit.''
   Mata, 48, was a key witness in a successful 1988 suit by 311
Hispanic agents who accused the bureau of bias in hirings,
promotions and discipline. A Texas federal judge set up a panel
headed by former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan to review promotions to
rule out discrimination.
   ``It is very ironic that those hearings are going to go forth
next month, and that allegations against Mr. Mata and other agents
... are all of a sudden surfacing,'' Rodriguez said.
   He said more minor administrative actions had been taken against
about 10 others involved in the lawsuit, including agents in El
Paso and San Antonio, Texas; Los Angeles; San Juan, Puerto Rico,
and Atlanta.
   Rodriguez said he will file additional charges of harassment
with U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton in Texas, who has
jurisdiction over the lawsuit.
   About 425 Hispanic agents serve among the FBI's 10,000
employees, said Rodriguez, himself a former agent.

<HEAD>10 in New York Arrested for Possession of Hypodermics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 10 AIDS activists on a street
corner before any intravenous drug users could take advantage of
their offer to exchange dirty syringe needles for clean ones.
   The activists had set up a table Tuesday to distribute the
needles and AIDS education materials. Among those arrested was Jon
C. Parker, a medical student and former drug addict who has led a
three-year effort to distribute 50,000 free needles to addicts on
the East Coast.
   The activists were protesting Mayor David Dinkins' decision last
month to phase out a needle exchange program begun by the
administration of former Mayor Ed Koch. The pilot program was meant
to curb the spread of the AIDS virus, HIV, which can be transmitted
by sharing used needles.
   ``People will use drugs, people will shoot up whether they have
a clean needle or not,'' said Alan Beck, a spokesman for the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, which organized the event with Parker's
National AIDS Brigade. By providing clean needles, the activists
are saving lives, Beck said.
   New York is one of 11 states where possession of a hypodermic
needle without a prescription is illegal. Those arrested in the
Lower East Side section of Manhattan on Tuesday were given tickets
for misdemeanor possession of a hypodermic needle, said Sgt. Nick
Vreeland, a police spokesman.
   Intravenous drug users accounted for about 43 percent of the
4,000 AIDS cases reported last year in the city, which has an
estimated 200,000 intravenous drug users.

   Police today accused ``international socialists''
of being behind widespread tax protests that disrupted local
council meetings and led to clashes with authorities.
   But a protest organizer said 99 percent of the demonstrators
were local people angered at having to pay higher taxes.
   The controversial new ``community charge'' is a flat tax on all
adults over age 18 that opponents say unfairly favors the wealthy.
   People rebelling against it included an 89-year-old former war
correspondent who handed back his medal at Buckingham Palace and a
teacher who lectured magistrates on the Magna Carta.
   Four constables were injured and 21 demonstrators arrested
Tuesday in the worst violence, in Bristol. Anti-tax disturbances
also were reported in Bradford, Birmingham, Exeter, Maidenhead,
Norwich, Weston-super-Mare, Worcester, Gillingham, Lowestoft and
Reading.
   Police Federation chairman Alan Eastwood claimed that many
protesters were from outside London.
   ``It is rent-a-mob Trotskyites who attend most of these
demonstrations,'' he contended in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. Radio 4.
   ``Why should a police officer have to be assaulted because
somebody feels aggrieved about a tax? It is these international
socialists who take on any issue to have a go at the police,'' he
said.
   Steve Nally, secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax
Federation, said he sympathized with the far-left Militant group,
which along with ``many other people from a broad political
spectrum'' had been involved in peaceful protests against what has
been dubbed the poll tax.
   He insisted 99 percent of the protesters were local people.
   ``We don't condone the violence that has gone on, but we
understand people are very angry about this issue,'' he said on the
same program.
   The citizens were backed by their representatives in the House
of Commons, where Michael Martin of the opposition Labor Party told
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ``Your friends are deserting you.
Why don't you give up this irrational obsession to implement the
poll tax?''
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose waning popularity has been blamed in part
on the tax, again blamed local councils for spending too much money
and thus forcing taxes to be increased.
   Scuffles began in Bristol as about 500 demonstators learned that
the council set a tax of $810 per adult per year, one of the
highest in England. One policeman was taken to the hospital
unconscious after he was knocked to the ground, kicked and punched.
   In the northern city of Birmingham, protesters scuffled with
council officials and police. A councilor of the governing
Conservative party and two teenage aides held doors to the council
chamber shut and kept all but half a dozen demonstrators out.
   David Green, 18, who is working for the Conservatives before
starting university studies, was punched in the face and bruised.
``They just started to push their way in and I was determined to
stop them,'' he said.
   The council meeting was suspended for 30 minutes. There were no
arrests.
   Two officers were injured as police fought running battles with
tax protesters in Weston-Super-Mare in Avon. The council meeting
there was suspended for more than two hours as doors and windows
were smashed and scores of people invaded the building.
   One group of protesters staged a sit-in annd nine people were
arrested before order was restored, police said.
   Council meetings in Norwich and Maidenhead were halted by
invasions of demonstrators. Several people were injured when
trouble erupted outside the civic offices in Reading, Berkshire.
   Hand-clapping protesters disrupted a hearing in Bradford, where
teachers also walked out Tuesday to protest spending cuts made to
keep the tax down to 267 pounds ($440).
   A day earlier, protesters dressed as Robin Hood's merry band
invaded the council chamber in Nottingham, blew whistles, tossed
papers and attacked council members with shaving-cream pies.
   Former war correspondent Richard McMillan, 89, who returned his
Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace, said his protest
was not for himself ``but for the hundreds of thousands of poor
people who are worse off than I am.''
   Robert Orme lectured magistrates in Stroud, Gloucestershire that
the Magna Carta, signed by King John at Runnymede in 1215, requires
``general consent'' to any tax.
   ``This government appears to have general dissent,'' he said.
   The average English household will pay 170 pounds ($280) more
under the community charge than under the property tax it replaces
_ an increase from $837 to $1,112, the BBC said Tuesday.
   The figures were calculated by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance Accountants based on charges already set by 250 councils.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher on Weakness of Yen and Mark, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in European trading late
this morning, buoyed by the weakness of the West German mark and
Japanese yen, dealers said. Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market was again testing the
central banks' resolve to keep the dollar from rising.
   ``The dollar is well bid, but the market is extremely nervous
because it expects to see the central banks any moment now,'' a
trader said.
   Central banks refrained from intervening Tuesday, following
heavy dollar sales on Monday.
   Traders said the weakness of the mark and the yen were the main
factors pushing the dollar up at the moment. ``We're bullish,''
said a trader at a large U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   Dealers said there were no new factors in the market, but added
investor demand for dollars was sustained and would keep the dollar
well supported.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 150.75 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 150.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7040 West German marks, up from 1.7005
   _1.5020 Swiss francs, up from 1.4985
   _5.7570 French francs, up from 5.7450
   _1.9185 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9105
   _1,256 Italian lire, up from 1,254.75
   _1.1863 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6415 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6495 late Tuesday.
   Bullion dealers said gold prices were weaker, reflecting the
market's preoccupation with the dollar's movements and the lack of
any clear indication of a retreat from its recent advances.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.25 a troy ounce,
down from $405 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $402.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $402.75, down from $405.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.83 to close at a bid $402.90.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.15.

<TEXT>
   Hotels this month are charging
steep security deposits to make guests think twice about tossing
furniture out the windows.
   Paintings that normally hang in lobbies and hallways now sit
safely in storage.
   Otherwise, the tolerance level for disorder has risen with the
noise level as spring break and its hordes of beer-drinking,
hormone-driven students arrive at this resort island.
   Myndy Michaels, 20, a sunbathing Ball State student, said
Tuesday that she and her sorority sisters had stayed ``buzzed'' for
about 24 hours on a drink called ``whammies.''
   ``Padre is the best place to party because it's not like a meat
market and there's no rules,'' she said, ``and this is my new
bathing suit.''
   Noon had yet to arrive, but fresh kegs of beer were planted in
the sand near volleyball nets. Sun reflected off rows of
suntan-oiled young women and the ubiquitous day-glow beach wear.
   ``We switched into what we call a spring break mode as of last
Saturday,'' said Craig Vogel, sales director of the Sheraton South
Padre Island Beach Resort. ``We abandoned being a three-star hotel
and turned into a spring break hotel.''
   That means the hotel's convention and brunch areas will shut
down for the month and that getting a room requires a
$50-per-person deposit. Paintings, plants and other portable
objects have been moved out of high-traffic areas.
   Island promoters say they expect up to 200,000 spring breakers
over a nine-week period that began the last week of February. The
student population reaches its peak from March 10-24, when many
Texas schools are out, said Geri Jean Wilson, director of the South
Padre Island Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau.
   Some resort areas, particularly in Florida, in recent years have
grown weary of the rowdy students and established strict ordinances
to discourage spring breakers.
   Not so in South Padre Island, a town of about 1,000 permanent
residents near the Mexican border.
   ``South Padre Island welcomes spring breakers, and we extend an
invitation to them,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``We look at it as if we're
creating brand loyalty right now.''
   Police chief Ed Sanders says his 17 officers tend to leave the
students alone. Police did, however, arrest nearly 1,000 of the
students last year, most for severe public intoxication and
disorderly conduct.
   Mexican officials have started a voluntary sign-in program for
spring breakers, as a means of keeping track of who's there, said
Antolin Licona Lopez, immigration director for the Mexican
government in Matamoros, 25 miles south of here.
   He said the program was not created because of the disappearance
and cult murder last March of University of Texas student Mark
Kilroy, who was found buried near Matamoros along with 14 other
victims.
   Judging by the high occupancy rate at the island, the cult
murders don't appear to have affected the spring break business,
officials say.

<HEAD>NEC, AT&amp;T to Cooperate in Semiconductor Technology</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's NEC Corp. and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. today announced an agreement to cooperate in
developing and manufacturing a wide range of semiconductors and
other technologies.
   The agreement will greatly enhance the U.S. corporation's access
to Japan's world-dominating electronics market.
   NEC, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, agreed to
cooperate with AT&amp;T's Microelectronics division on various projects
for at leat five years.
   Under the agreement, AT&amp;T Microelectronics will receive a
license to market, design and produce NEC gate-array computer
chips, which can be used for a wide variety of applications because
they are programmable.
   ``An important feature of this agreement is that customers of
both companies will enjoy the advantage of having two stable
sources of identical gate-array products,'' said William Warwick,
president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics.
   ``From AT&amp;T, NEC will receive our most sophisticated
computer-aided design tools,'' Warwick told a news conference.
   He said the two companies are working on accelerating the
placement of AT&amp;T Microelectronics semiconductor products into a
variety of NEC products, such as communications systems and
computers.
   AT&amp;T Microelectronics, which is based in Berkeley Heights, N.J.,
also will provide manufacturing support for certain NEC microchips
that are widely used in consumer electronics products.
   ``This will allow Japanese customers to obtain products made by
an American firm, and will give AT&amp;T a greater presence in the
Japanese market, especially with consumer electronics companies,''
Warwick said.
   ``The agreement will benefit customers of both companies through
the strength of product lines and capabilities, and enhancing of
business opportunities,'' he said.
   Tomohir Matsumura, NEC executive vice president and director of
its semiconductor division, said computer chips are often referred
to in Japan as the ``staple food'' or ``crude oil'' of the
electronics industry.
   ``This agreement shows that one single company cannot stand
alone and needs more resources to survive,'' Matsumura said.
   ``It makes sense for AT&amp;T as a big semiconductor user to go to
NEC, a big semiconductor producer,'' said Charles Elliott, an
electronics analyst with the investment firm Goldman Sachs. ``But
AT&amp;T is also a big semiconductor developer, and it makes sense for
AT&amp;T to design and NEC to produce.''
   Neither of the executives would attach monetary figures to the
accord, but Warwick said he was confident it would be continued
after five years.
   ``It's long enough to indicate to our customers that our access
to gate-array technology is not a one-generation access,'' Warwick
said. ``I have no doubts it will grow, and continue indefinitely.''
   The agreement will facilitate NEC's policy of increasing
purchases of foreign semiconductors to ease trade friction.
   U.S. officials, angered by what they claim is a closed Japanese
market to foreign semiconductors, say Japan agreed to boost the
foreign share of the semiconductor market here to 20 percent by
July 1991.
   But foreign chips' share stood at only 12.9 percent in the final
quarter of 1989, according to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   NEC expects to purchase $5.3 million worth of AT&amp;T
semiconductors in 1990, and more in 1991, though there is no target
figure for next year, NEC spokeswoman Akiko Sato said.
   The manufacturer plans to raise its internal use of foreign
computer chips from the current 20 percent to 23 percent by July
1991, when the U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord expires, and to some
24 percent by the end of next year, Miss Sato said.
   The NEC-AT&amp;T accord reflects an increasing trend toward
corporate tieups in the semiconductor industry.
   AT&amp;T Microelectronics announced two weeks ago that it will
produce semiconductor memory chips for the international market in
a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corp., another major
Japanese chip manufacturer.
   International Business Machines Corp. said in January that it
would set up a joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany to
develop advanced memory chips.

   Masked gunmen today shot and killed a
prominent journalist who often criticized Moslems fundamentalists
in Turkey and blamed Syria for a resurgence of terrorism in his
homeland.
   Cetin Emec, a board member and columnist of Turkey's largest
circulation newspaper, Hurriyet, died after being rushed to the
hospital shortly after the 9 a.m. shooting, police said. His driver
also was killed in the attack.
   Authorities said two masked gunmen fired on Emec and his driver
as they were leaving his house in the fashionable Suadiye district
to go to work. The driver, Sinan Ercan, was shot in the back as he
fled, police said.
   The gunmen escaped in a stolen car, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for
the shooting.
   President Turgut Ozal denounced the attack, saying: ``The
assailants and the treacherous people behind them should know that
they will not succeed to ruin the calm and stability of our country
with terrorism.''
   In his last column, published in Hurriyet today, Emec expressed
alarm at the resurgence of terrorism in Turkey. He accused Syria of
supporting terrorist groups in the region and claimed Syrian
leaders were behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland
in December 1988.
   Emec, the son of a newspaper publisher, was known for his
liberal views and often criticized the Moslem fundamentalist
minority in Turkey.
   A month ago, a gunman shot and killed a prominent Turkish
jurist, Muammer Aksoy, at the entrance to his house in the capital
city, Ankara. A previously unknown Moslem fundamentalist group,
calling itself the Islamic Revenge Organization, claimed
responsibility for that shooting.
   Callers to newspaper offices said Aksoy was punished for his
opposition to the Islamic style of dress for women, which requires
covering from head to toe. Police could not verify the claim.
   A wave of terrorism in late 1970s claimed 5,000 lives in Turkey
and triggered a military takeover in 1980 that lasted three years.

   A junk dealer who was once the focus of
a mail bomb investigation said there were no surprises when he
testified before a federal grand jury.
   ``It was the same things we've been through before,'' Robert
Wayne O'Ferrell of Enterprise said Tuesday after he left the
federal courthouse.
   O'Ferrell's attorney, Paul Harden said his client was not
subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. He said O'Ferrell and
his wife agreed to testify voluntarily at the request of federal
prosecutors.
   O'Ferrell again denied any wrongdoing and said he continued to
believe he was not a suspect in the case. As for the grand jury,
``I don't think they believe we had anything to do with it,'' he
said.
   Federal authorities declined to comment on the proceeding.
   No one has been charged in the December mail bombings that
killed Judge Robert Vance of Birmingham, a member of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, and a Savannah, Ga., lawyer.
   In January, federal investigators swarmed over the Enterprise
area, searching O'Ferrell's home, salvage business, septic tanks
and other property in the southeast Alabama vicinity.
   O'Ferrell came under scrutiny because he had an employment case
that was heard by a three-judge panel that included Vance. Federal
agents said typewritten court correspondence from O'Ferrell matched
typewritten material sent by the alleged mail bomber.
   O'Ferrell has said he could have had the typewriter and used it
to type his court case letters but then sold it to an unknown buyer.
   Investigators found several typewriters in the salvage store but
none that had type matching the letters, according to federal
agents.

<TEXT>
   In a country where not everybody can
get a telephone, a sumptuous, illegally built luxury hideaway for
top army brass had phones in the sauna and on docks within arm's
reach of fishing generals.
   A lieutenant colonel promoted himself after receiving a Defense
Ministry invitation that mistakenly identified him as a full
colonel. He was allowed to keep the extra star after complaining
that removing it from his epaulets would make him a laughing stock.
   A new book by Col. Imre Bokor is full of such anecdotes about
the Hungarian army _ some funny, others frightening, but all
calculated to expose three decades of stupidity and corruption in
high places.
   Bokor, 59, was retired less than a week after publication of his
book ``Petty Monarchs in Uniform,'' which depicts former Defense
Minister Lajos Czinege as an inept and corrupt warlord who beat his
adjutant and took large tracts of state property for his own use.
   The book says Czinege created a private game reserve on state
land, put up 80 miles of fence and stocked the area with deer and
other trophy animals. High-ranking visitors tested their
marksmanship from army helicopters or Czinege's special
four-wheel-drive vehicle with a rotating seat and rifle-rest.
   Some of his generals are described as alcoholics who danced on
banquet tables laden with food and drink or slept for hours in
moving Defense Ministry elevators. Others are accused of emulating
Czinege by building luxurious private homes with army manpower and
materials.
   The book depicts one general, who had no medical training, as
donning a doctor's robe on a voyeuristic excursion to a women's
ward in a military hospital.
   Senior government officials have said most of the allegations
are true, as did a parliamentary committee set up specifically to
deal with Bokor's accusations.
   In a report made public March 1, the committee condemned the
past Communist practice of choosing leaders on the basis of
political reliability instead of competence and qualifications,
saying it ``led to the selection of the unfittest.''
   It recommended that the supreme public prosecutor consider
criminal charges against those accused of the greatest
transgressions.
   Even Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati has described the
allegations as ``largely true.'' He has offered to reactivate
Bokor, but the soft-spoken colonel now wants nothing to do with an
army he feels was betrayed by much of its senior staff.
   He told of harassment following publication of the book in
November, both by superiors trying to pressure him to retract his
allegations and by others.
   ``I received several dozen anonymous death threats in the first
weeks that the book was available,'' he told a reporter, adding
that he now carried a handgun as a result. ``It got to the point
where my poor wife didn't want to answer the phone.''
   The book appeared at a time of increasing debate about the
future of the army, with Hungary beginning to replace decades of
following Moscow's lead with indepedendent strategic goals as it
evolves into a democracy.
   The army had a strength of 106,000 in the early 1980s, and its
mission was largely to act with other Warsaw Pact forces.
   Bokor's allegations of poor leadership followed assertions by
others that the army would have been unable to muster an
indepedendent defense of the country in recent years.
   With few exceptions, ``the transport vehicles are in terrible
shape, and commanders are relieved if the vehicles manage to get
outside camp gates,'' Lt. Gen. Mihaly Toeroek, secretary of
Parliament's defense committee, declared on Feb. 12. ``The army ...
has no suitable organization capable of independent military
activity.''
   Some of the book's key figures have remained on active duty.
Czinege, who has denied wrongdoing, retired as defense minister in
1985 and as deputy premier in 1987.
   The initial 50,000-run printing of the book was sold out less
than two weeks after publication, and extensive testimony before
the parliamentary commission investigating Bokor's allegations was
on front pages of many newspapers.
   The affair has taken on an international dimension with
criticism of the Soviet Union.
   Jenoe Fock, premier during some of Czinege's tenure as defense
minister, told the nine-member commission on Feb. 6 that the
Soviets felt they could work with Czinege _ so he stayed, even
though the leadership was familiar with some of his shortcomings.
   Commission members have criticized not only Czinege and his
contemporaries but also the entire 42-year Communist era in Hungary.
   ``This investigation has made one thing very clear, and that is
that insignificant, primitive politicians had run this country,''
panel head Ernoe Raffay said on state radio.
   Bokor said the faults he exposed originated in the monolithic
rule of Communists in Hungary and other Soviet bloc countries.
   ``In the final analysis, these were created by the system, and
not only within the army,'' he said. ``I've heard it said that
there is the need of many Bokor books to expose corruption
elsewhere in our society.''

<TEXT>
   The Afghan defense minister trying to
overthrow his government is a longtime Marxist hard-liner who
opposes President Najib's efforts to make peace with the
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   Both Tanai and Najib were key players in the 1978 coup that
first brought the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan to
power. But while Najib in recent years has sought to distance
himself and the party _ at least publicly _ from their communist
roots, Tanai has a reputation as an unreconstructed, militaristic
Marxist.
   Afghans who are both pro- and anti-Najib and the party say Tanai
has been involved in three of five known coup attempts against
Najib since the former secret police chief became president in
December 1986.
   The fact that Najib retained Tanai in the Cabinet and even
promoted him to the party's 14-member Politburo illustrates the
paradoxes inherent in the Soviet-backed Kabul government.
   On the one hand, Najib has sought to placate some foes within
the party by giving them positions of power. On the other hand, he
has had to guard against attempted coups by them.
   The Afghan sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tanai was linked to previous coup plots in July and December 1989.
   Government-run Kabul Radio identified Tanai as the ringleader of
Tuesday's attempted coup and President Najib demanded his capture
``dead or alive,'' according to Afghan exile monitors in New Delhi.
   Radio Kabul said Tanai, who was named defense minister by Najib
about 18 months ago, plotted with fundamentalist guerrilla leader
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar to try to topple Najib.
   Such as alliance, if true, would be more one of convenience and
opportunism than ideology, for Tanai has long been known to
advocate a harsher stance against the mujahedeen guerrillas than
Najib himself.
   By linking Tanai to Hekmatyar, Najib's government may be
attempting to set the stage for Tanai's final _ and perhaps fatal _
disgrace. In recent months, Najib has increasingly used Hekmatyar
as the personification of evil while maintaining there are other
mujahedeen leaders who are more rational and welcome to join the
government.
   At the same time, Hekmatyar has become increasingly estranged
from his fellow guerrilla leaders, rejecting their political
leadership and executing some of their followers.
   Tanai is one of the top leaders of Khalq, or ``masses,'' faction
of the ruling party. Najib is the leader of its Parcham, or
``flag,'' faction.
   Although both factions include hardliners with commitments to
communism, Parcham has become less doctrinaire and is less hawkish
than Khalq, especially when it comes to making political overtures
to the mujahedeen guerrillas, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Najib loyalists say the president has recently embarked on
attempts to change the party _ and even its name _ in an effort to
make it more palatable to the mujahedeen, the Afghan people and
foreign opponents, such as the U.S. government
   To the mujahedeen, such overtures are futile, since these
Islamic fundamentalists refuse to deal with a party they consider
nothing more than a bunch of ``godless communists.''
   Tanai, who is thought to be in his mid 40s, has a reputation as
an ultra-hardliner, especially when it comes to making any
concessions to the mujahedeen or modifying the party, which Najib
has sought to portray as a defender of Islam and champion of a
free-market economy.
   Tanai, like many Afghans, takes his surname from his ancestral
homeland _ the Tanai region near Khost in southern Afghanistan.
   He became defense minister sometime in 1988. As often happens in
Afghanistan, his appointment apparently was not formally announced.
But by late 1988 he was being referred to in Kabul as the defense
minister and when Najib reshuffled his Cabinet in February 1989
after the Soviet withdrawal, Tanai remained defense minister.
   He was elevated to full membership from alternate membership in
the party Politburo in either late 1988 or in 1989, a promotion
that can only take place with Najib's concurrence.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu criticized a U.S.
congressional leader who threatened to press for sanctions on
Japanese imports this summer unless progress is made in trade
talks, Japanese newspapers reported today.
   Richard Gephardt, Democratic majority leader in the House of
Representatives, made the comment Sunday, one day after President
Bush and Kaifu held two days of talks in Palm Springs, Calif. The
two leaders announced no specific measures to further trade talks,
and Gephardt said the meeting produced nothing to resolve the
countries' worsening trade relationship.
   Speaking to Japanese reporters Tuesday, Kaifu said Gephardt's
statements were ``cruel'' and representated a threat that unless
Japan cut its trade surplus ``to zero,'' it would be subject to
retaliatory tariffs on exports, Japan's major economic newspaper,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported.
   Similar remarks were also reported in the Daily Yomiuri
newspaper. An aide to the prime minister said he could not confirm
the newspaper reports.
   Kaifu, speaking before Parliament's upper house Tuesday, urged
lawmakers to cooperate in changing Japan's economic structure for
the sake of the Japanese people as well U.S.-Japanese relations.
   The United States trade deficit with Japan last year totaled $49
billion.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi, Daimler-Benz Announce Cooperation Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two giant business groups in Japan and West Germany
have announced plans for wide-ranging cooperation in fields such as
semiconductors and aeronautics, officials said.
   Specifics of the accord between West Germany's Daimler-Benz and
Japan's Mitsubishi still must be ironed out, but if it goes
through, the agreement could pose a competitive challenge for the
United States, analysts said today.
   The agreement to expand ties was reached in secret meetings
between the top exeuctives of the massive industrial groups in
Singapore last weekend, Mitsubishi officials announced Tuesday.
   Mitsubishi said the industrial giants were discussing
cooperation in ``high-growth industries such as aerospace,
electronics and the service sector that would benefit from
development on a global scale and make effective use of the skills
of both groups.'' The statement gave few other details.
   ``The European market has become increasingly important for
Japanese companies, and many are desperately seeking a firm
foothold before the integration of the European Community in
1992,'' said Atsushi Takashima, a corporate analyst with Nomura
Research Institute.
   ``For Benz, Mitsubishi is a giant company in Japan, and the
cooperation with Mitsubishi will help it achieve its plan to expand
outside Europe in regions such as Asia,'' Takashima said.
   But analysts said cooperation between the corporations in
aerospace and semiconductors might worry U.S. companies with which
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has had close ties in jet and rocket
production.
   ``For the United States, aerospace is the only field left in
which it can be proud of its technology,'' Asahi Shimbun newspaper
said today.
   Some Japanese newspapers speculated the agreement might worsen
trade tension between Japan and the United States, but an analyst
with Sanwa Research Institute disagreed.
   ``The arrangement between Mitsubishi and Daimler may be
threatening to the United States, but I don't think it will hurt
ongoing trade talks,'' he said.
   He said on condition of anonymity that the accord was part of a
``global trend to establish joint projects among companies from
Japan, Europe and the United States.'' Such projects will only
increase in coming years, he said.
   International Business Machines Corp. agreed in January with
Siemens AG of West Germany to develop advanced computer memory
chips, he said.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries spokesman, Ryo Suzuki, tried to ease
any U.S. concern about the agreement today.
   ``For us, the most important partner has been the United States,
and it will remain the same if we start a joint project with
Daimler,'' he said.
   He said the partnership did not indicate company interest was
shifting from America to Europe.
   Mitsubishi said the companies excluded defense from areas of
possible cooperation because Japanese companies are prohibited by
law from exporting weapons. ``Defense is one area where the private
sector is unable to make its own decisions. It is understood that
it is the government's job,'' Suzuki said.
   Newspapers speculated the companies avoided cooperation in
defense to avoid a repeat of their negative wartime images.
   During World War II, both Mitsubishi and Daimler were active in
arming the Axis powers. Daimler-Benz engines were used extensively
in German tanks, fighters and bombers, and Mitsubishi helped
produce Japanese aircraft such as the Zero fighter.
   Mitsubishi spokesman Kyosuke Mori said executives from both
companies agreed to meet once a year, and he said the next meeting
was likely in 1991.
   In 1988, Mitsubishi Motor and Mercedes-Benz established
Stuttgart Auto Service Inc., a joint-venture company to sell and
service Mercedes-Benz cars in Japan, said Yoshimi Mizuno, a
spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz Japan Co. Last year, 31,511
Mercedes-Benz were sold through the joint venture, she said.

   A state prison and hospital complex lost
heat again today when a fuse blew as workers tried to restore power
to buildings housing about 3,200 prisoners and patients.
   The Howard Complex was hit by a power outage Tuesday morning and
about five hours later the complex's boilers stopped working. Steam
from the complex's boilers is used for heat and to generate
electricity.
   Thomas Romeo, director of Mental Health, Retardation and
Hospitals, said this morning that portable boilers would be needed
to restore heat to the complex. ``We're sure back to square one,''
Romeo said after learning of this morning's mishap.
   Heat had been restored overnight as the temperature dropped to
10 degrees. Gov. Edward D. DiPrete called in the National Guard
Tuesday night to provide blankets and portable generators.
   Most of the 30 buildings in the complex had backup generators.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp rise in bad real estate and other
domestic loans held consumer bank profits to a weak $2.7 billion in
the final three months of last year, the government said today.
   For the year, banks earned $16.3 billion, a sharp 34 percent
decline from last year's record $24.8 billion profit, said the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   Earnings reached record highs in the first two quarters of 1989
of $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion. But the industry went into the
red in the July-September period, losing $740 million because of
Third World debt problems.
   ``1989, like March, came in like a lion and went out like a
lamb. We had record earnings in the first half of the year...(and)
we had a dramatic change in the second half,'' said FDIC Chairman
L. William Seidman.
   Loan losses industry-wide soared to $9.2 billion in the fourth
quarter, a record since 1948, when that figure was first tracked.
   In the Northeast, bad real estate loans more than doubled. Four
Northeastern states joined oil-producing states on the list of 10
states with the worst real estate loan problems.
   In order, starting with the worst, were Arizona, Texas,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Alaska, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New
Hampshire, New York, New Mexico.
   Seidman predicted the industry's performance would improve this
year, at least in the first six months.
   ``All is not on the black side....particularly (small) community
banks showed improved earnings,'' he said. ``Much of the ... (third
world loan problems) would appear to be behind most of the large
banks.''
   In another positive sign, the list of ``problem'' banks, which
the FDIC uses to predict bank failures, stood at 1,093 at the end
of 1989, down from 1,394 a year earlier.
   Seidman forecast fewer bank failures in 1990 than the 206
failures in 1989. He said the FDIC insurance fund, after a small
loss in 1989, should break even or grow slightly in 1990.

<TEXT>
   The removal of U.S. chemical weapons
from German soil will begin this summer and transporting the more
than 100,000 shells will pose no danger to the public, U.S. and
West German officials said today.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg detailed plans for a
massive, high-security transport of the nerve gas weapons, which
have been stored in this country for more than 20 years.
   In May 1986, then-President Reagan and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
agreed that all the artillery shells would be removed.
   The presence of chemical weapons on German soil has long been
criticized by West German environmentalists and peace activists.
They have alleged that in case of an accident involving chemical
weapons, U.S. security concerns would take precedence over the
protection of West Germans.
   U.S. officials have strongly denied the claim.
   Speaking to reporters, Stoltenberg insisted the transport, which
is expected to take about three months, would present no dangers to
the environment or the public. But he asked West Germans to help
make sure there are no ``attempts at disruption'' of the shipments.
   Stoltenberg did not specify what kinds of ``disruptions''
concerned him.
   U.S. Army Gen. John Heldstab, deputy chief of staff for
operations for the U.S. Army-Europe, told reporters the army was
``confident'' that proper security would be provided for the
transports.
   Stoltenberg said withdrawal of the artillery shells is scheduled
to begin in July and last until September.
   He said the shells _ now kept at a depot near Clausen in the
state of Rhineland-Palatinate _ would be loaded into thick,
airtight steel magazines which would in turn be placed inside
specially designed sheet-metal containers.
   It was apparently the first official statement indicating where
the chemical weapons are kept. Their location had previously been
kept top secret for security reasons.
   Stoltenberg said the containers would be transported by truck to
a U.S. munitions depot in Miesau, 25 miles from Clausen, and loaded
aboard railway cars. The trains would transport the containers to
the North Sea port of Nordenham, where they will be loaded aboard
specially equipped U.S. transport ships. Stoltenberg said the
munitions will then be shipped to the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific
for destruction.
   He also said the ``strictest security conditions'' would be used
for the transport of the artillery shells, including ``special
training'' for truck drivers moving the containers out of Clausen.
   Col. Eckart Fischer, of the West German army, said the artillery
shells contain about 400 tons of the nerve gases ``VX'' and
``Sarin.''
   Fischer told reporters that more than 5,000 containers will be
needed to move the 155mm and 203mm artillery shells.
   Heldstab said the munitions represented about 1 percent of the
United States' total stockpile of chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
   About 4,000 Tibetans staged a one-day
fast today to demand that Chinese authorities lift martial law,
imposed exactly one year ago.
   Men, women and children joined Tibetan Buddhist monks in the
fast at the mountain headquarters of the Tibetan
government-in-exile.
   ``Though China has swallowed Tibet, it has not been able to
digest it,'' said the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and temporal
leader and winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   He accused the Chinese of trying to ``wipe out'' his people.
   Chinese authorities in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, have urged
increased vigilance in the upcoming weeks because of several
anniversaries in the Tibetan fight against Chinese rule.
   For the past two years on March 5, pro-independence Tibetans
have clashed with security forces. At least 16 people died and
hundreds were injured last year after three days of fighting, and
martial law was imposed March 7.
   March 10 is the anniversary of a crushed uprising in 1959 that
prompted that Dalai Lama and thousands of his supporters to flee to
India.
   A Western tourist speaking in Beijing said Tibetan authorities
have banned tourists from the Himalayan region until mid-March.
   About 100,000 Tibetans now live in India and have been granted
refugee status.
   Tibetan activists have clashed with Chinese security forces at
least four times since September 1987, leaving scores of protesters
dead and wounded. Hundreds of activists have been arrested and
executions have been carried out, Tibetans say.
   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th
century. Tibetan activists say their homeland was an independent
country until Chinese troops invaded in 1950.
   For years, the Dalai Lama demanded that China leave Tibet and
grant the huge, mountainous territory complete independence. But in
June 1988, he offered to allow China the responsibility for Tibet's
defense and foreign affairs in exchange for Tibetan autonomy over
internal affairs.
   China rejected the proposal but has said it is willing to hold
talks. No negotiations have been scheduled.

<HEAD>Cabinet Vote Delayed on Middle East Peace Plan</HEAD>

   Ministers of the right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-of-center Labor Party clashed today over U.S. Middle East
peace proposals, but a Cabinet vote on the plan was postponed until
the weekend.
   Also today, a suspected Palestinian collaborator was found
hanged near his village in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab reports
said. The army said it demolished the West Bank home of a suspected
uprising activist.
   Labor leaders said that if Likud rejected the American proposals
at Sunday's Cabinet session, they would ask Labor's Central
Committee to vote the next day on leaving the government and
forming a new coalition with small religious and left-wing parties.
   Economics Minister Moshe Shahal, a Labor member, told reporters
after the session he doubted the ministers from Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud could accept the compromise proposals.
   ``I don't think there is a possibility to get Likud to change
their minds,'' Shahal said. ``I think that if the answer is
negative from Likud, this government has no continuation.''
   Today's Cabinet debate focused on the composition of a
Palestinian delegation to preliminary peace talks with Israel in
Cairo that would prepare the ground for elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Likud refuses to allow Palestinians from Israeli-annexed Arab
east Jerusalem to participate in the talks, saying such
representation would threaten Israel's claim of sovereignty over
the disputed city.
   Some Likud hard-liners have also rejected the participation of
Palestinians who have been registered as residents of the occupied
lands but have since been deported by Israel.
   The compromise proposed by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
technically met Israel's requirement that the Palestinian
negotiators be residents of the occupied territories.
   But in a nod toward the Palestinians, Baker says the delegation
should include at least one Palestinian who has an office or a
second home in Jerusalem and one Palestinian who was deported by
Israel.
   In today's session, Labor ministers urged that the Cabinet,
based on Baker's proposal, agree to ``consider on a name-by-name
basis any Palestinian who is a resident of the territories,''
Shahal said, explaining Labor's stand.
   The two sides agreed before the session to postpone a vote until
Sunday, apparently because two Likud ministers were missing from
the crucial meeting, Shahal said. The 12-member Inner Cabinet, the
government's key decision-making body, consists of six ministers
from Labor and six from Likud.
   Arab reports said the body of Fahmi Zaanin, 23, was found
hanging from a tree near the Gaza village of Beit Hanoun, where he
was accused by fellow Palestinians of collaboring with Israeli
authorities. He was kidnapped from his home Saturday by masked
Palestinians, they said.
   At least 659 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   An additional 193 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.
   Also today, soldiers blew up the home of Mohammed Karoush, 45,
of the West Bank village of Deir Balout. Arab reports said 14
people lived in the house.

<HEAD>`60 Minutes' With Andy Rooney Back in Top 10</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to CLARIFY that ABC's Feb. 25 special was
a major factor in temporary ratings drop. Picks up 8th graf, `For
the week...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few minutes with Andy Rooney and the return
of regular competition helped lift ``60 Minutes'' from 18th to
fourth in the ratings.
   The rebound of ``60 Minutes,'' which was beaten the week before
by an entertainment program _ ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' _
for the first time since 1978, put CBS second in the overall A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings for the week.
   Sunday's broadcast, in which Rooney discussed his three-week
suspension and denied he is a bigot, had a 22 rating, easily
beating ABC's ``Life Goes On.''
   That series had an 8.9 rating, trailed by NBC's Disney movie,
which averaged an 8.3. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   On Feb. 8, Rooney was given a three-month suspension without pay
after a gay magazine quoted him as saying blacks had ``watered down
their genes.''
   Rooney denied making the remark. CBS later cut short the
suspension, allowing the curmudgeonly humorist to return to his
end-of-the-show slot.
   The ratings of ``60 Minutes'' slipped during Rooney's three-week
absence, and the program on Feb. 25 dropped to 18th.
   However, network research analysts said the major factor in the
Feb. 25 drop was competition from the one-time rerun of the
premiere of ABC's hit ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   CBS research vice president Michael Eisenberg said viewer
curiosity over Rooney's return to Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' played a
part in its ratings rebound, as did ABC's return to its regular
program.
   For the week, NBC was first with an average rating of 14.4. CBS
had a 13.1 and ABC 12.4.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings:
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 22.7; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 22.4; ``Cheers,''
NBC, 22.3; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 22.0; ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC, 21.8; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 21.0; ``CBS Sunday
Movie _ The Incident,'' CBS, 20.8; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, 20.1;
``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 19.5; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC, 19.2.
   ``The Incident'' starred Walter Matthau as a small-town lawyer
who defends a Nazi prisoner of war charged with murder. It was
Matthau's first TV movie. ``The 1990 Miss USA Pageant'' was No. 20
for the week with a 15.9 rating.
   On the other end of the numbers, ABC's ``H.E.L.P,'' about an
elite rescue squad, premiered at No. 79 for its Saturday 8 p.m.
time slot. ``Nasty Boys,'' in its second week for NBC, was tied for
52nd place with ABC's ``Elvis.''
   ABC captured first among the evening news shows for the eighth
week in a row. Peter Jennings' ``World News Tonight'' had an
average rating of 11.1, Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' a 9.8,
and Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' 9.7.

   Actor Ralph Waite, who played the
hard-working father on the TV series ``The Waltons,'' is running
for Congress, Democratic Party officials said.
   Waite revealed his plans at the monthly Riverside County
Democratic Central Committee meeting Sunday and was to formally
announce his candidacy today for the Democratic nomination for the
37th District.
   If he wins the nomination, his opponent likely would be
incumbent Rep. Alfred A. McCandless, a Republican from La Quinta
first elected in 1982.
   Tom Jameson, chairman of the central committee, said a Waite
candidacy ``will certainly add a great deal of excitement to the
race.''
   Other Democratic candidates include Jeffrey E. Jacobs, a paper
company account executive, and Johnny Pearson, a retired Air Force
master sergeant.
   The 37th District includes most of Riverside County. Republicans
account for 48.6 percent of registered voters, and Democrats 42.2
percent.
   A resident of Rancho Mirage, a desert resort city near Palm
Springs, Waite briefly considered a congressional bid two years ago.
   On ``The Waltons,'' which ran from 1972 to 1981, Waite played
the father of a large family struggling to make a living during the
Depression in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains.

Curacao, West Indies, before returning to Rome, the Vatican said
today.
   The May 6-14 trip will be John Paul's 47th foreign pilgrimage
and second to Mexico.
   He is visiting Czechoslovakia April 21-22.
   The Vatican issued a schedule for Mexico listing stops in Mexico
City; the gulf port of Veracruz; Aquascalientes in the northwest;
San Juan de los Lagos in western Jalisco state; the northern cities
of Durango, Zacatecas, Chihuahua and Monterrey; the southeastern
cities of Tuxtla and Villahermosa, near the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The pope will also stop in Chalco, a poor suburb of Mexico City
and the site of a well-known shrine.
   On his way back to Rome, John Paul is scheduled to visit
Curacao, part of the Netherlands Antilles on May 13. He returns to
Rome the afternoon of May 14.
   John Paul visited Mexico in January 1979, his first foreign trip
as pontiff.

<HEAD>Brazilian Communist Leader Dies, Led Opposition for 60 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luis Carlos Prestes, who led
Brazil's Communist opposition for half a century, died today of
cancer, doctors said. He was 92.
   Prestes had suffered from leukemia, said Dr. Peylor Meira,
administrator of the Beneficiencia Portuguesa Hospital, where
Prestes died.
   In the 1980s, Prestes accused the Brazilian Communist Party of
abandoning Marxist-Leninist dogma. He was removed from the
leadership in 1980 and expelled from the Communist Party in 1984.
   He campaigned for center-left candidate Leonel Brizola in
Brazil's 1989 presidential election, won by conservative Fernando
Collor de Mello.
   In his final days, nearly penniless, Prestes was largely
supported by world-famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, a
long-time Communist sympathizer.
   Born Jan. 3, 1898 in the southern city of Porto Alegre, Prestes
moved with his family to Rio de Janeiro, where he attended the
prestigious Realengo military academy.
   In the 1920s, Prestes took part in unsuccessful military
uprisings against President Artur Bernardes, who was accused by
critics of selling out national interests to England to pay the
foreign debt.
   In 1924, Prestes, an army captain, led rebelling soldiers on a
trek through Brazil's remote interior to preach revolution. The
legendary ``Prestes Column'' crossed 15,000 miles and 13 states,
outmaneuvering and outfighting superior government forces. He
became a popular hero.
   Three years later, the Prestes Column with just 65 men crossed
the border into Paraguay. In exile in Bolivia and Argentina,
Prestes became a Marxist and moved to the Soviet Union.
   In 1935, as head of the Brazilian Communist Party, Prestes
returned to Brazil and led an unsucessful uprising against the
government of President Getulio Vargas.
   The movement gave Vargas the excuse he needed to declare the
``Estado Novo'' dictatorship in 1937, and Prestes was sentenced to
46 years in prison.
   After the dictatorship fell in 1945, Prestes was given an
amnesty and elected to the senate. Two years later the Communist
Party was outlawed again and Prestes was forced into hiding.
   He led opposition to a 1964 right-wing military coup, but in
1971 he fled the country for the Soviet Union. He returned with a
new amnesty in 1979.
   Prestes' body was to lie in state at the Rio de Janeiro state
assembly and later to be buried at Rio's Sao Joao Batista cemetery,
Dr. Meira said.
   Prestes is survived by wife Maria do Carmo Ribeiro and 10
children.

   Sixty bikers guided their Harley-Davidson
motorcycles into a rural cemetery for the funeral of former
President Carter's sister, Gloria Carter Spann, an avid rider.
   Mrs. Spann, the last surviving sibling of Jimmy Carter, died
early Monday of the same cancer that killed three other members of
the family. She was 63.
   About 300 people, including Mrs. Spann's husband, Walter, and
the former president and his wife, Rosalynn, gathered at the
Lebanon Cemetery on Tuesday for a 30-minute graveside service.
   The mourners included men in business suits, women in Sunday
dresses and bikers in grimy faded jackets with club colors
emblazoned on the back.
   Walter Spann, his long hair tied in a pony tail, wore a black
leather jacket.
   Mrs. Spann belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights
organization and was named Most Outstanding Female Motorcyclist in
the nation in 1978.
   The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Co. sent a floral spray.
   Riding side-by-side on 30 motorcycles, the bikers led the
funeral procession from Americus to the cemetery, a few miles
southwest of Plains in rolling farm country. Eight bikers served as
pallbearers.
   John ``the Reverend'' Herlihy, a photographer and custom bike
builder from Melbourne, Fla., was introduced to the mourners by the
Rev. Jenny Jackson Adams, pastor of Morningside United Methodist
Church in Americus.
   The bearded middle-aged biker, with tattooed arms and long hair,
and wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with ``Biker Lifestyle,''
stood at a microphone a few feet from the coffin. His voice cracked
with emotion as he remembered his discussions with Mrs. Spann.
   ``Please take some time and say a prayer for her because I know
she's in biker heaven,'' Herlihy said.
   The pastor described Mrs. Spann as a courageous person who lived
life to the fullest and was an inspiration for others.
   ``Gloria was tough and Gloria was wonderful,'' she said.
``Gloria was a private person and saw no real need to explain her
life to people. She did not seek the spotlight, but she was a light
_ bravest of the brave _ and of course she knew exactly what she
was up against with this disease.''
   Mrs. Spann had been diagnosed in December as having pancreatic
cancer, the same disease that killed her father, James Earl Carter;
her sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton; and her brother, Billy Carter.
   Adams said Mrs. Spann felt that Christianity can be meaningful
for all types of people.
   ``Perhaps it was part of her nature to transcend culture and to
transcend lifestyles in the way that she did and to bring out the
best in all kinds of people who thought of themselves as pretty
rough characters,'' Adams said.

   A riverboat carrying 209 people, most of them
children, smashed into a freighter and sank during the night in the
Amazon River. Police said one person died and 134 were missing and
feared drowned.
   The Andresito sank 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, an hour and and a half
after leaving Iquitos, a Peruvian river port 715 miles northeast of
Lima, police there said.
   The boat's helmsman told police in Iquitos that the Andresito's
motor failed and vessel began drifting in the Amazon's fast
currents.
   In the darkness it smashed into several small boats anchored
along the shore. It then careened into a freighter tied to a dock,
rolled over and sank in the dark, swirling waters of the Amazon,
police said.
   Police said 74 people had been rescued by dawn today and that
the body of a small girl was found. Heavy rain was hampering rescue
boats and divers in their search for survivors and bodies.
   Most of the passengers were children, their parents and school
teachers who were returning home from Iquitos after school
holidays, police said.
   They were headed to Puritoyacu, a jungle village on an Amazon
tributary three days travel by boat from Iquitos, police said.
   The 182-foot riverboat rolled over quickly and sank because it
was overloaded with passengers and lumber for building a new school
in Puritoyacu, authorities said.
   They said the 430-foot, 7,500-ton freighter received minor
damage.
   It was identified as the Yacu Caspi, a Peruvian-owned vessel
that travels the Amazon to the Atlantic and to Caribbean ports. The
freighter was tied to a dock when the Andresito smashed into its
side.
   It had arrived Feb. 28 from Panama with sugar and wheat flour
for Iquitos and steel pipes for Occidental Petroleum Corp., which
produces oil in jungle fields in the Iquitos area.

   Heart specialist Richard Kehoe recalls being
jolted when he heard a radio play-by-play announcer say his
patient, a pro basketball player, had collapsed during a game.
   Only after a long commercial break did Kehoe learn, to his
relief, that Terry Cummings of the San Antonio Spurs had simply
sprained an ankle.
   It has been about five years since Kehoe helped Cummings decide
whether to continue his career despite an irregular heartbeat, and
the decision to go ahead appeared to be ``quite safe,'' Kehoe said.
   But, he added: ``There probably isn't a day that goes by that I
don't think about it.''
   His experience illustrates the difficult medical dilemma of
whether an athlete's career should continue despite risk from a
life-threatening disease _ a problem highlighted by the death on
Sunday of basketball star Hank Gathers.
   A player with Loyola-Marymount University in Los Angeles,
Gathers collapsed during a game and died. He had been diagnosed as
having an irregular heartbeat after fainting during a game in
December ot conduct its
affairs by coercion,'' Caperton said. ``The deal is off.''
   Federation leaders said they would meet with their county
representatives today and decide whether to strike.
   Under the proposal, raises for public school teachers and higher
education employees would have been financed by a $1 per ton tax on
coal. The proposal also guaranteed full funding of the state's
health insurance program.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins said state law does not permit a
teacher walkout, but federation executive director Bob Brown said
this week a 1980 Supreme Court opinion gives public employees the
right to strike.
   The walkout could jeopardize today's start of the state high
school basketball tournament, an official said.
   Warren Carter, assistant director of the Secondary Schools
Activities Commission, which governs prep athletics, said each
county has individual rules concerning extracurricular activities
when schools aren't in session.

<HEAD>House Of Commons Renews Prevention Of Terrorism Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons voted to renew for another
year the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which allows police to detain
terrorist suspects without charge for up to seven days without
having to inform anyone.
   The extension, granted in a 227-136 vote late Tuesday, also
allows police to ban suspects from Northern Ireland from entering
mainland Britain.
   The act was first passed in 1974 after the Irish Republican Army
bombed two pubs in the central England city of Birmingham, killing
21 people.
   It now is used to combat international terrorism in general but
remains a prime weapon against the outlawed IRA.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with
the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Home secretary David Waddington, the member of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Cabinet responsible for police,
told the Commons:
   ``During 1989 the nation witnessed not only 62 further killings
in Northern Ireland ... but also the terrible incident at Deal in
which 11 soldiers were brutally murdered and the callous shooting
of a Royal Air Force corporal and his baby daughter in West Germany
... As time goes on, we are more, not less, resolved to defeat
terrorism.''
   Waddington said without the act, the work of security forces in
countering terrorism would have been more difficult and less
effective. He said the casualty toll also would have been higher.
   An IRA bomb at an army school of music at Deal in southeast
England in September killed 11 people who play in military bands.
   Two IRA gunmen killed an RAF corporal and his 6-month-old
daughter in October near a British air base at Wildenrath in West
Germany.

<TEXT>
   County supervisors defied a judge's order and
refused to schedule a June election on making Malibu a city. They
instructed county attorneys to challenge the judge's jurisdiction
over the issue.
   Backers of cityhood for the star-studded seaside enclave said
their lawyers would ask Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs to cite
the supervisors for contempt.
   ``What we are seeing is an unmitigated outrage,'' Walt Keller,
co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, said of the
county's move Tuesday.
   Ms. Janavs last week ordered supervisors to comply with an order
she issued in January to set an election date no later than March
9, the deadline to include the cityhood vote on the June 5 ballot.
   The Board of Supervisors has opposed incorporation, insisting
that a sewer system be installed before cityhood is established.
They contend that once elected, a new Malibu government would try
to block the planned system.
   Many cityhood supporters regard the county's insistence on a new
sewer system as a prelude to widespread development. They filed a
lawsuit against the supervisors accusing the county of violating a
state law that sets a 60-day limit on the duration of a hearing
before an election date is set.

   Children in the 72 poorest nations
could gain access to a basic education by 2000 if $5 billion a year
is spent on the task, a senior United Nations official said today.
   ``The annual cost by the mid-1990s is roughly equivalent to the
amount the world now devotes to military expenditure every two
days, or to the total of the USA's annual expenditure on cigarette
advertising and the amount the Soviet Union spends a year on
vodka,'' said James P. Grant.
   Grant, director of the U.N. Children's Fund, did not say what
current education spending is. He as addressing the third day of
the 155-nation World Conference on Education for All. U.N.
officials sponsoring the conference have said almost 1 billion
adults are illiterate, and more than 100 million children have
never seen the inside of a classroom.
   A U.N. official, who requested anonymity, said the World Bank
and other agencies and countries have pledged half of the extra $5
billion needed annually. He said the conference sponsors hoped to
persuade donor countries to make up the rest.
   At Tuesday's conference session, the World Bank announced it
will substantially increase its loans for international education,
to an annual level of $1.5 billion by 1993. The U.N. Children's
Fund said it would increase education funding to $200 million
annually by the end of the century.
   Grant said Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa had the worst
problems educating children and the newly industrialized countries
of East Asia were the success stories.
   Some conference delegates said that even with new loans, poor
nations can't improve their education programs unless the bank and
other lending institutions abandon current repayment conditions for
large-scale debt.
   World Bank President Barber Conable told reporters today that
poor nations can devote more resources to education by changing
spending priorities and eliminating waste, including excessive
military budgets.

   Coast Guard officials fought today to
contain a slick of more than 100,000 gallons of heating oil
spreading from the smoldering wreck of an oil barge that exploded
and caught fire in a busy waterway.
   A sheen of oil spread along a four-mile area on the Arthur Kill
waterway between New Jersey and New York's Staten Island, said
Coast Guard Capt. Robert North.
   The oil was released by two explosions and fire Tuesday
afternoon aboard the barge Cibro Savannah, which was leaving the
Citgo Petroleum Corp. docks in Linden with a cargo of 4.2 million
gallons of diesel fuel.
   One person was injured.
   It was the third time in a week crews had to place containment
booms around a vessel to prevent further pollution in the shipping
channel, which connects through the Kill Van Kull to New York Habor.
   Govs. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Mario Cuomo of New York
directed their environmental officials to meet with oil executives
and questioned industry standards for refining, transporting and
storing oil in the New York harbor.
   ``Enough is enough. We need to be shown that everything is being
done to end this string of environmental tragedies,'' Florio said.
   Donald Wright, the vessel's captain, said at his hospital bed
that he had just loaded the barge with No. 2 fuel and was being
towed by a tugboat from the Citgo docks when the first blast
occurred.
   ``All I seen was steel flying and flames,'' said Wright, 41, of
Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He said gasoline vapors from a previous
cargo may have caused the first explosion, but he did not know how
the vapors would have been ignited.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Howard Holmes said the explosion
nearly broke the barge in two. ``It was like a branch that's still
green. You can break it, but it won't totally break in two,'' he
said.
   Booms were put in place to keep the slick from spreading to part
of Staten Island, two rivers and a sensitive refuge and spawning
ground for birds.
   The Arthur Kill, which separates New York City's Staten Island
from New Jersey, was the site of a 567,000-gallon oil spill on Jan.
1-2 from a ruptured Exxon underwater pipeline.
   On Feb. 28, 30,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the Kill
Van Kull from a barge anchored in Bayonne. On Thursday, 3,500
gallons of heavy crude spilled from a barge into the Arthur Kill at
Exxon's refinery in Linden.

   Libya today denied U.S. reports that a plant outside
Tripoli is producing chemical weapons and said the allegations were
aimed at creating suspicion surrounding moves by Arab-African
nations toward unity.
   In Washington, the White House said today the Libyan plant at
Rabta, 60 miles south of the Libyan capital, was dangerous and
urged ``vigorous efforts'' to stop its operation. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said evidence suggests the plant ``is
dangerous and becoming more so.''
   Late Tuesday, U.S. officials said the plant was turning out
mustard gas and nerve agents. The officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, did not disclose the quantity of chemicals allegedly
produced.
   ABC television news, in a report broadcast late Tuesday, said
the plant had been producing mustard gas and assembling
hand-packed, small bombs that could carry the chemical weapons to
targets.
   JANA, the Libyan news agency, in a dispatch monitored in Rome,
said an unidentified ``official source'' at the Libyan Foreign
Ministry today ``disclaimed'' the ABC report that Libya has
produced ``quantities of chemical weapons in (the) Rabta medicine
factory.''
   The source, according to JANA, said ``such allegations aired at
present by some media circles aim at creating a state of
suspicion'' surrounding Arab-African nations' efforts toward
economic and political unity.
   The Arab Magreb Union, formed in February 1989, groups Libya,
Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania and aims to set up an
economic common market on the European model.
   Since Western reports surfaced in 1988 that the factory was
gearing up to produce chemical weapons, Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
regime has insisted the plant's purpose is to produce
pharmaceuticals.
   Western journalists were invited to tour the plant in January
last year but were not allowed to inspect the facility after they
arrived in Rabta.
   The West German government has investigated allegations a West
German firm helped build the plant. The investigation has not yet
been concluded. U.S. officials have urged foreign companies not to
help develop or supply the plant.
   The JANA dispatch today said the Foreign Ministry source
expressed ``sorrow over the sham'' reports, especially in light of
Libya's call for ``balanced and open dialogue with the new U.S.
administration.''
   Former President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing of Tripoli
and another Libyan city, Benghazi, in April 1986 in retaliation for
what he called Libya's support of international terrorism.

   Mile for mile, Vehbi Gunduz is probably the
worst cab driver in town. He insults, bullies and threatens
passengers, dispatchers and inspectors.
   He overcharges riders, denies them receipts and refuses to take
them where they want to go. His cab is filthy, his trunk a mess,
his hack license as hard to find as a taxi on a rainy night.
   But his ride on the wild side may be over.
   On Thursday, the Taxi and Limousine Commission plans to ask a
judge to revoke license No. 411689.
   Although the ranks of the city's 34,000 taxi drivers contain
many candidates for the unofficial title of New York's worst
cabbie, Gunduz's resume is five pages long. In recent years, he has
been convicted of, or admitted to, 119 rules violations.
   ``He's in a pickle,'' said attorney Michael Stone, who has
represented Gunduz. The best Stone can say about Gunduz's record?
``He never has attacked a member of the public.''
   Gunduz has dodged expulsion from the industry by never going too
far. He's the kind of driver who, according to commission staffer
Bruce Schaller, ``consistently does a lot of fairly bad or pretty
bad things, but nothing really outrageous'' that would lead to
license revocation.
   Gunduz, who is in his late 30s, recently moved from his Long
Island home and had his telephone disconnected. He could not be
reached for comment on the case against him.
   Last year, he was one of eight ``hack rats'' whose faces
appeared in the Daily News. Gunduz, who was serving a two-month
suspension, blamed most of his troubles on airport dispatchers
trying to shake him down for money.
   ``I am getting tired of this job,'' he said. ``I'm going to give
up. I'm working and working, and I'm paying all the money for the
summonses.''
   But a few months later, a taxi inspector at Kennedy
International said he saw Gunduz charging an Asian passenger $15
for a ride between the TWA and United terminals.
   The meter was off, and the inspector found that a seal that
prevents tampering had been broken. When the inspector tried to
remove the cab's medallion, Gunduz ``physically poked and pushed
me,'' the inspector reported.
   Three months later, according to commission records, Gunduz
picked up a couple outside Iberia's terminal. They had only one
piece of luggage, which was fortunate, because his trunk was so
cluttered it had room for no more _ rule violation No. 1.
   The couple said they wanted to go to another terminal. Gunduz,
who does not like short fares, said no _ violation No. 2. The
dispatcher told him to get going, because cabbies must take
passengers to any destination in the city.
   Gunduz drove off from the stand, but about 1,000 feet away, he
stopped, announced that his meter did not work and told his
passengers to get out.
   When they refused, he stepped out, yanked their suitcase from
the trunk and dumped it in the road. When the couple got out to
retrieve it, he jumped back in and sped off _ violation No. 3.
   Inside the cab, there had been no sign of the driver's photo,
name, or license number _ violation No. 4. But the man scribbled
down the plate number, and Gunduz eventually was given a ticket in
absentia for $400.
   Meanwhile, the commission was hatching a plan to rid the roads
of chronically bad cabbies who by some estimates are responsible
for 10 percent of rider complaints.
   The commission searched its files and fashioned a most-wanted
list of nine cabbies. The plan was to wait for any of them to
commit an infraction, and use it to seek license revocations based
on the entire driving record, rather than one or several egregious
incidents.
   All the commission needed was one new violation, no matter how
small, to get a driver before a judge.
   The commission did not have to wait long. The rules took effect
Oct. 15; three days later Gunduz allegedly threatened a dispatcher
at Kennedy.
   When the summons popped up in the commission computer, agency
lawyers went to work. A judge will hear Gunduz's case this week and
tell the commissioners within a few weeks whether Gunduz should be
thrown off the road.
   Whatever the fate of his license, Gunduz is a dinosaur; under
the new rules, no New York cabbie will ever again be allowed to be
so bad for so long. Thanks to an automatic point system for
violators, ``We'll get them off the road before they can accumulate
a record like his,'' promised Schaller.

   The Bush administration said today it was
encouraged by the latest comments from Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani saying a solution is near to the plight of the Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   ``We're encouraged by the comments. ... They certainly are more
hopeful than what we've heard in the more distant past,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency today quoted
Rafsanjani as saying, ``My feeling is that the issue of the
hostages is moving toward a solution.''
   Rafsanjani repeated Iran's demands that Western nations help
trace Iranian hostages missing in Lebanon and ``also reduce their
mischievous acts,'' the news agency reported.
   Fitzwater said the remarks ``are in line with statements that we
have seen in recent days and weeks that there was some interest in
Iran in better relations with the West. We hope that that's the
case and that it will result in release of the hostages.''
   The White House spokesman added, ``But we have no direct
knowledge that that is going to happen, and we have no direct
knowledge of Mr. Rafsanjani's motives or purposes in making those
remarks.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III registered his hope
Tuesday that the hostages would be released.
   ``We see what is coming across here and we are encouraged by the
fact there is speculation,'' he told reporters. ``Let's see if that
speculation proves out. ... We would like to see anybody that could
influence it in that regard weigh in.''
   While the Bush administration is not suggesting release is
imminent, officials are confirming reports of a flurry of
behind-the-scenes talks by officials outside the government.
   ``We've been talking for a long time to anyone who could have
influence, Algerians, Syrians,'' a U.S. official told The
Associated Press. ``We talk to the Iranians through a lot of
people. We have talked to enough people that the message has gotten
through to the Iranians.''
   The message, said the official, who demanded anonymity, is: ``We
know you want access to the West. You've said you are against
terrorism. We want to see action.''
   Even with all the activity, the official acknowledged, ``we
don't have anything to correlate all this together and say this is
moving.''
   Meanwhile, a Tehran newspaper close to Rafsanjani said 1990
would be the last year for captivity for the hostages and that a
resumption of ties to the United States was not a condition for
their release.
   In an editorial, the English-language Tehran Times said Syrian
President Hafez Assad would visit Tehran soon, after an expected
trip by his foreign minister, Farouk Al-Sharaa.
   Syria is both the dominant military force in Lebanon and the
closest Arab country to Iran that also maintains U.S. ties.
   Officially, the State Department had no explanation for the
flurry of rumors.
   ``There are no U.S. government talks,'' spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said. ``Our policy has not changed since yesterday. There
is nothing new today and I don't know why all those rumors sprung
up.''
   But Baker, intercepted by reporters in the diplomatic entrance
as he ushered Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to his
limousine, did not choose to spike the rumors.
   Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, suggested that a political struggle in Iran might
explain some of the positive westward-leaning statements from
Tehran.
   Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over Hezbollah,
the umbrella group for radical Shiite Moslems holding some if not
all of the eight American hostages.
   The eight Americans are among 18 Westerners believed to be held
captive in Lebanon. Terry A. Anderson, who was Middle East bureau
chief of The Associated Press, has been held the longest _ since
March 16, 1985.
   In Beirut, the respected An-Nahar daily ruled out any hostage
release soon, but quoted unidentified Lebanese fundamentalist
sources as saying Iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue.
   The sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct
contacts between Iran and the United States, but both were looking
for a mechanism for releasing the hostages. The report did not
elaborate.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   March 5
   Austin (Texas) American-Statesman on crime:
   A dramatic report out of Washington has evidence that nearly one
in four black men nationwide is in the hands of the criminal
justice system at some level, a much higher rate than that of white
or Hispanic males. Although the report advocates alternatives to
prison, which could include needed social services, what should be
emphasized is alternatives to crime. ...
   In far too many inner-city neighborhoods, crime is becoming the
legacy that parents leave their children. In far too many
communities, the only skills passed down to the new generation are
survival skills, often survival at any cost. For young men trapped
in poverty and living in a society where chances for success are
constantly shrinking, selling drugs and robbing people is
considered by some the best means of support.
   The inner-city unemployment rate approaches 40-50 percent in
many communities.
   A few months back, the National Urban League advocated that the
so-called peace dividend be used to overcome such social problems.
While use of that illusory fund in itself was somewhat unrealistic,
the problem does demand attention.
   For those who are willing and able to work, job training that is
compatible with the job market must be offered. And the resulting
jobs must be more than minimum-wage dead-end jobs.
   But the best and most long-term solution would be to create an
environment in which fewer people are introduced to the criminal
justice system.

   The Athens (Ohio) Messenger on asbestos:
   In a new and persuasive report in the magazine Science, a group
of American and French researchers make it clearer than ever that
when it comes to asbestos in schools and other public buildings,
the cure can often be worse than the disease.
   They point out, among other things, that in schools where
asbestos-containing material is not damaged, the danger of
asbestos-related disease is several thousand times lower than the
danger from aircraft accidents, high school football, drowning,
home accidents or long-term smoking.
   They also say that while one type of asbestos is frequently
associated with lung disease in miners and asbestos workers, the
type most commonly used in the United States sheds a fiber of a
different shape that's more easily repelled by the lungs. ...
   ``Prevention of tobacco smoking, the prinicipal cause of lung
cancer,'' they conclude, ``is both a more promising and rational
approach to eliminating lung tumors than asbestos abatement.''

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on foreign searches:
   The Supreme Court ... gave an unsatisfactory answer to an
indirect question about what kind of country this is. The court
said the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect foreigners from
warrantless searches by U.S. officials on foreign soil.
   And you thought this was a place where justice is an
all-inclusive philosophy. Apparently not. This country will split
semantic hairs to justify actions that go against the grain of the
Fourth Amendment's assertion that people should be secure in their
persons, houses, papers and effects. ...
   The decision may make is easier in the future _ or in the case
of evidence seized during the American invasion of Panama _ to
prosecute drug smugglers and other unsavory characters. It will
make a handy tool in the war on drugs; drug trafficking knows no
borders and honors no high-sounding ideals about human rights.
   But the Constitition was not written to make law enforcement
easier. It was not designed to facilitate the war on drugs. It was
not meant to be read with an eye to convenience.
   It was designed to reflect the kind of country this is and what
it believes to be the proper relationship between government and
people. To narrow those sentiments ... makes America's much-touted
devotion to human rights look a little less than sincere. ...
   (The decision) invites the kind of behavior the United States
should discourage.

   Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on foreign searches:
   What kind of message does the United States send to the rest of
the world when we allow agents of our government to do things in
other countries that wouldn't be allowed here? A bad one.
   What kind of example of freedom is it when we don't practice
elsewhere what we preach in our own Constitution? A hypocritical
one.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ... ruled the Fourth Amendment's
provisions barring unreasonable search and seizure do not apply to
property located abroad and owned by foreign suspects. That's not
surprising. No one expects the U.S. Constitution to apply in other
parts of the world.
   What Americans should expect is that its principles would be
observed by representatives of our government operation abroad. The
Constitution is the document, after all, that is held up as the
shining example of freedom that should be emulated.
   The issue was brought before the high court in a dispute over
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration operations in Mexico in
which houses owned by a Mexican drug smuggler were searched by U.S.
agents without a warrant. The ruling is expected to strengthen the
hand of U.S. law enforcement officials in the war on drugs.
   No one (except drug dealers) would want to impede those efforts,
but we question a government policy that would order American
agents to function in foreign countries by a different set of
standards than those we observe at home.

   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis., on credit card frauds:
   The story out of Milwaukee the other day about credit fraud via
card numbers retrieved from merchants' trash holds a message for
users of credit at both ends of the system. ...
   The Milwaukee gang, and others around the country, pulled
carbons from merchants' trash containers, not only for credit
cards, but long-distance access codes and accounts with shipping
companies as well. They used the numbers for purchases and the card
owners got the bills.
   Consumers tend to treat credit cards casually. In truth, they
represent a great deal of money. Even though laws protect consumers
from heavy losses when card numbers are used by thieves, there
still is a potential for some loss unless safeguards are taken.
   The simplest is to not leave behind the carbon copy of a credit
transaction. Some carbons are automatically split but even that is
not totally safe.
   Credit customers should be sure to retrieve their own carbons
after credit purchases and store clerks should be instructed to
offer to return the carbon.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on smoking:
   There is good news and bad news on the smoking front.
   The good news is that ... smoking has been banned on all
domestic airline flights of less than six hours. That means
smoke-free airplanes on all flights within the contiguous 48 states
and on 99.8 percent of all domestic flights. The only exceptions
are flights of six hours or longer to Alaska or Hawaii.
   In time, given the steady march toward more smoke-free
environments, it can be hoped that all domestic flights will be
smokeless.
   There is also good news in the fact that the percentage of
American adults who smoke fell to 29 percent in 1987 from 40
percent in 1965.
   The bad news is that smoking costs the nation $52 billion a year
in health costs and lost productivity.
   That's $12 billion more than the cigarette companies generate in
sales each year. ... That's 390,000 Americans dying from
smoking-related causes each year _ more than the yearly deaths from
all American homicides, suicides, auto accidents,
cocaine-heroin-alcohol abuse and fires combined.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Jimmy Carter's role in Nicaragua:
   For too long, and unfairly to boot, he was the Rodney
Dangerfield of former presidents. But Jimmy Carter has been
redeeming himself with good works, capping a stellar comeback ...
with a truly magnificent performance in Nicaragua's low-flashpoint
elections.
   The so-far peaceful Sandinista concession could still fly apart,
of course, but without ... Carter's energetic, personal efforts it
might not ever have gotten this far.
   He was always a detail man, and as he bounced down dusty
Nicaraguan roads in his role as an observer, he paid close
attention to the election's finer points. On each visit he nailed
down another agreement _ safeguarding the return of exiled
Nicaraguan Indians, condemning campaign violence, unfreezing
stalled U.S. funds intended for opposition parties.
   But ... Carter has not been without a vision, too, of the
potential for peace in what appear to be otherwise intractable
conflicts. He has proved that recently as a globe-trotting mediator
_ a ``diplo-evangelist,'' one reporter called him _ brokering
disputes from Ethiopia to Panama. In fact, his verdict of fraud in
Panama's vote last May was widely regarded as the last straw for
Gen. Manuel Noriega, stripping him of any pretense of legitimacy.
   In Nicaragua, ... Carter apparently went one better. Beyond
legitimizing the outcome, he provided some evidently much-needed
counseling to a stunned Daniel Ortega (as perhaps only one defeated
national leader can give to another), while urging victorious
Violeta Chamorro to adopt a sober, conciliatory public demeanor.
   Coming only a week after former President Ronald Reagan was
demonstrating his shaky grasp of Nicaraguan affairs in taped
testimony on the Iran-contra imbroglio, the Carter mission was a
reminder that a steady, hands-on approach isn't the worst way to
deal with tough conflicts.

   Las Vegas Review-Journal on the Nicaraguan election:
   The American left _ including those residents of West Hollywood,
Berkeley, Santa Monica and Cambridge, Mass., who traipsed off to
communist Nicaragua to plant coffee, teach English and propagandize
for the Sandinistas _ is crestfallen.
   The people of Nicaragua have spoken, and American leftists hated
what they said.
   With the demise of the Sandinistas and their Marxist-Leninist
``experiment'' in which the Nicaraguan people were used as guinea
pigs, what's a poor pro-Sandinista American leftist supposed to do
now?
   Perhaps they shall shift their resources toward helping the
Cuban-backed guerrillas in El Salvador impose a communist
dictatorship on that unfortunate nation.
   Or perhaps they can work toward preventing Fidel Castro's
bankrupt dictatorship from biting the dust in Cuba.
   One of these days, American Marxists who idolize the likes of
Ortega and Castro are going to have to face up to the fact that
they are no longer ``progressive.'' Instead, they truly must be
called reactionaries now, in a world in which people from East
Germany to Nicaragua are sweeping out the deadwood of communism.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the Nicaraguan election:
   As the world continues to spin, so do events, and both the pace
and magnitude are dizzying.
   In Nicaragua, the results are in and President Daniel Ortega ...
is out. More significantly, he agrees he's out. The winner, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, captured in the vicinity of 55 percent of the
popular vote. ...
   Despite Ortega's loss, the Sandinista Front remains alive and
well and may not be as gracious in defeat as its leader says he is.
... It is accustomed to power which it may be reluctant to release.
   The voters of Nicaragua elected Mrs. Chamorro to serve them. For
the moment, it is Ortega who, by standing firm in his acceptance of
the election outcome, can serve those voters best.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the Exxon indictment:
   Exxon Corp., which failed to contain last spring's Alaska oil
spill before it blackened 1,100 miles of shoreline, has been
frustrated again in its efforts to contain the spill's damages.
This time it was not oil, but criminal damages, that Exxon was
attempting to confine.
   Just a week ago, it looked as if the company would succeed. In a
tentative plea agreement that outraged Alaskans, the Justice
Department declared itself ready to limit Exxon's criminal
liabilities for the spill to $500 million. Civil suits by the
federal government would be banned for four years.
   A storm of protest was kicked up, however, by environmentalists
and others involved in the 150 lawsuits pending against Exxon _ and
the proposed settlement was abandoned. Exxon was indicted on five
charges. Criminal damages could reach more than $600 million, and
there are no limits on civil suits.
   ``By pursuing criminal charges in this case,'' Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh said in announcing the indictment, ``the federal
government is sending a strong signal that environmental crimes
will not be tolerated.''
   Those are welcome words.

to him by a gay magazine. Rooney denied making the remarks.
   The suspension created a wave of protest from free-speech
advocates and from viewers. During Rooney's suspension, the ratings
for ``60 Minutes'' _ the program on which he rambles about whatever
comes to mind _ dropped.
   So now, CBS is putting him back on. Not because the network
became a believer in free speech. But because his return will
certainly boost ratings.
   Did you ever wonder if Rooney would have been reinstated early
if the ratings for ``60 Minutes'' had soared while he was gone?
Just a rhetorical question.

   Victorville (Calif.) Daily Press on Sen. Alan Cranston:
   Sen. Alan Cranston, the Sierra Club's creature, keeps making
noises about how he's not only not going to resign, but plans on
seeking yet another six-year term. Were he re-elected, which he
won't be, he would have been a member of the Senate for nearly a
quarter of a century. ...
   Cranston, of course, is but the latest example of why we'd all
be better off if United States senators were limited to a maximum
of two terms, and congressmen to a maximum of six _ thus limiting
the membership in both chambers to a maximum of 12 years of
``public service.'' Even 12 years in some cases _ Cranston again
comes to mind _ is too long. ...
   He sees nothing sinister, for instance, about his role in the
savings and loan debacle and his acceptance of $850,000 in
contributions from the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan pipeline. ...
   Worst of all _ well, perhaps not worst, but right in there _
Cranston finds the idea of returning the $850,000 not only
abhorrent, but downright silly. How sad. ...
   (T)he Sierra Club, despite its avowed purpose of conserving all
creatures great and small, won't be able to keep this one around
much longer. His continued presence would only harm, and perhaps
ultimately destroy, some of the club's pet projects, chief among
them the passage of the desert preservation bill.
   Cranston has become damaged goods, and will soon be dumped. It's
too bad, in a way. We'd started to develop a certain affection for
the old fraud.

   The United States should support reform
efforts in the Soviet Union through moves such as liberalized
trade, credit guarantees and continued grain sales, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said today.
   But Baker, testifying before a House appropriations
subcommittee, said there is no need for direct financial aid to
Moscow and ``they haven't asked for it.''
   Rather, Baker said, the United States should share its business
and economic expertise, lift restrictions on credit and credit
guarantees and ``enhance'' discussions aimed at concluding a new
long-term grain sales agreement.
   ``We ought to support the reform efforts in the Soviet Union,''
Baker said. Asked whether communism has ceased to be a threat to
the United States, he added, ``We ought not to gloat too much over
our success ... It is not overly-productive to stick a stick in
their eye, just for the hell of it.''
   The secretary's comments came a day after the No. 2 House
Democratic leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, proposed offering not
only trade and investment incentives for the Soviets but also
direct food aid as ways of keeping President Mikhail Gorbachev's
reform campaign alive.
   Gephardt's proposal brought reactions from colleagues ranging
from wary approval to outright condemnation.
   ``We shouldn't be writing out checks to Gorbachev while he's
propping up Castro'' in Cuba and other communist regimes and
insurgencies around the world, said Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   Dole said it is time for the United States to aid Eastern
European countries emerging from decades of Soviet domination, but
that direct aid to Moscow of the sort proposed Tuesday by Gephardt,
the House majority leader, would at best be premature.
   ``We ought to exact a fair price for those benefits,'' including
a cessation of support for Cuba, Syria, Afghanistan and Angola,
Dole said.
   It was Dole who led the way five years ago in making the Soviets
eligible for U.S. subsidies to buy grain, a move that helped Kansas
wheat farmers. Since then, Moscow has bought more than 730 million
bushels of U.S. wheat at a subsidy value in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., noted that the Soviets haven't
requested U.S. help and that if they did, it would be wasted
without economic reform. ``Unless they reform the economy, it's
going down a rathole,'' Bradley said.
   Others on Capitol Hill said that while they thought Gephardt's
proposal would spark a useful debate, the idea would fall on
disapproving public ears.
   ``If you're going to start giving foreign aid to the hated
commies ... you've got a real sales job to do in the United
States,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Gephardt said when he offered the idea in a speech that he knew
there would be political risks involved and that Americans might
react negatively.
   But he told reporters: ``When I was in Europe two months ago I
was embarrassed that we are not being as strong and as courageous
as they are,'' weathering dramatic price increases and other
dislocations in the name of economic reform. ``Can't we do
something to help?'' he asked.
   Specifically, the Missouri Democrat called for food aid to the
Soviet Union along with most-favored-nation trading status and U.S.
risk insurance to businesses that want to invest in Soviet ventures.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., backed the Gephardt
proposal and said attitudes in Congress are changing along with the
rapidly moving events in the crumbling East Bloc.
   ``It is a dramatically different circumstance than it was only a
few months ago,'' Foley said, citing multiparty elections in the
Soviet Union.
   ``We should recognize these changes that are coming on very
fast, and that we have a stake in this country in supporting those
changes that are moving toward private economic activity and
democracy.''

   Civic leaders in Marseille took out full-page ads
in major newspapers Wednesday complaining that prejudice toward
France's second-largest city was jeopardizing its future.
   The ad, addressed ``to France, to Europe and the world,'' came a
week after Marseille officials protested a nationally televised
documentary about the city that they believed revived stereotypes
that it was crime-infested and filled with poverty-stricken Arabs
and violent right-wing reactionaries.
   ``Sustained rumors, willful distortions, repeated lies, perverse
calumnies, sometimes bordering on hatred, tarnish our image and
risk obstructing our growth,'' said the ad, signed by Mayor Robert
Vigouroux and 69 other leaders from the ancient Mediterranean port
city.
   Marseille, population 900,000, has been attracting disenchanted
Parisians who have been moving their businesses to the sunny
southern city.
   There has been a recent proliferation of new theaters, major
exhibitions and other cultural events that irate Marseillais
believe have been overlooked.
   ``Marseille is not a wounded city. It's a city very much alive,
proud of its past and confident of its future,'' the ad said.

<HEAD>Secessionist Rebels Reject Ethiopian Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secessionist rebels in Ethiopia's
northernmost province of Eritrea are rejecting economic and
political reforms proposed by President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said Ethiopia's economy
has been shattered by the government's war against it and other
rebel groups, and the only solution is to end the conflict.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi on Tuesday
night, the rebel group called again for a plebiscite in Eritrea to
determine the province's independence or unity.
   It said Mengistu was ``opposing this choice, which can genuinely
solve the Ethiopian problem promptly.''
   Mengistu on Monday proposed scrapping the rigid, Marxist
economic system Ethiopia has followed for 15 years and replacing it
with a mixed economy with free markets.
   He also proposed that the name of the ruling Marxist-Leninist
Workers' Party be changed to the Ethiopian Democratic Unity Party
and that it seek a broader, more representative base.
   In a speech to the party's Central Committee, Mengistu invited
opposition groups to participate, but he stopped short of proposing
a multiparty system or diminishing the ruling party's monopoly on
power.
   ``In short,'' the rebel radio broadcast said, ``there is nothing
which can be changed except the name (of the party). What is very
surprising is that Col. Mengistu even now believes that he will be
able to deceive the people through such a kind of open mischief.''
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence for 28
years. Last month, they opened a new offensive and claimed to
capture Ethiopia's only deep-water port of Massawa on the Red Sea.
   The government has not acknowledged that claim, but admits the
port has been closed by fighting that it says continues in and
around the city.
   The government also faces a threat from a smaller rebel force,
the Tigre People's Liberation Front. It has been fighting for 14
years to overthrow Mengistu and replace his regime with one
patterned after that of Albania, the last hard-line Marxist state
in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>China to Cut Enrollments of Ideologically Weak Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universities found to be weak in ideological or
political studies will have their enrollments cut and may be shut
down, China's leading daily said Wednesday.
   The official People's Daily said the State Education Commission
also decided to reduce enrollments of universities with graduates
in majors in less demand when job assignments are made. Most likely
to be affected are programs in the liberal arts.
   The commission, meeting in the southern city of Changsha, worked
out an enrollment plan for 620,000 new undergraduates and
vocational students for the school year starting in the fall.
   In 1989, colleges and universities enrolled 597,000 freshmen, a
sharp drop of 10.8 percent from 1988 as the government moved to
purify campuses of ``bourgeois liberal'' tendencies.
   Many universities where students actively participated in the
April-June pro-democracy movement had their freshman classes cut.
   Beijing University, China's most prestigious campus and a center
of the democracy campaign crushed by military force on June 3-4,
had its freshman enrollment slashed from 2,100 to 800, with all
first-year students sent out of Beijing for a year at a military
school.
   Ideological studies emphasizing loyalty to the Communist Party
were expanded and made compulsory, and work-study programs designed
to make students more in touch with the masses were increased.
   The Education Commission said enrollments will be cut, or
suspended, in 1990 for schools weak in political and ideological
work and where courses are not clearly linked to future jobs.
   It said experiments in allowing a few students to pay their own
way would continue, but that self-financed students would be
restricted to less than 3 percent of the total.
   The government previously promoted the idea of accepting more
students who pay their own tuition as a means of raising funds for
the woefully underfinanced education system. Self-paid students
were accepted with lower test scores and given greater freedom to
choose their own jobs after graduation.
   The drive to ensure the ideological loyalty of students,
however, appears to have made financially independent students
suspect. Normally, almost all tuition and boarding costs are
subsidized by the government.
   The People's Daily, in a separate article, reported a Public
Security Ministry crackdown on students who pay large sums to
obtain admission documents from foreign schools.
   It said the ministry, which must approve all passports, won't
recognize illegally bought admission notices or economic guarantee
documents, and that anyone caught practicing fraud or illegally
dealing in foreign exchange will have their passports seized.
   A small number of foreign organizations and individuals have
cheated Chinese and made large profits by selling admissions to
foreign schools, it said.
   The government has already moved to discourage the many students
wanting to study in the West by making it more difficult to obtain
transcripts and take English-language proficiency tests and
requiring applicants to have up to five years' work experience
before going abroad.

<TEXT>
   Police today fired on
thousands of protesters who attacked and burned government
buildings in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana. Seven people
were reported killed and up to 500 injured.
   The clash began after up to 50,000 protesters in the nominally
independent homeland _ the second to erupt in violence in four days
_ attempted to stage a march to demand its reintegration into South
Africa and the resignation of the territory's president.
   Police using rifles and tear gas guns opened fire after
protesters set fire to public buildings and vehicles in Garankuwa
in the homeland north of Johannesburg, local officials said.
   Homeland President Lucas Mangope tonight declared a state of
emergency in several parts of Bophuthatswana, which has about 2
million residents scattered over seven separate pieces of land.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg, quoting witnesses and
doctors, said at least seven people were killed by gunfire and that
up to 500 people suffered various injuries. The independent South
African Press Association said the sound of gunfire and fighting
was heard in several areas.
   The new violence erupted as South African troops restored order
in the Ciskei homeland on the southeastern coast after rioting in
the wake of a military coup. South African officials said Ciskei
was calm and no unrest was reported today in that territory.
   The Ciskei military government seized power Sunday in a
bloodless coup and, allying itself with the anti-apartheid African
National Congress, declared itself in favor of reintegration into
South Africa.
   Anti-apartheid activists contend the homelands were established
in an attempt by the white minority government to restrict blacks
to the most isolated and underdeveloped parts of the country and
deny them citizenship. About half of South Africa's 28 million
blacks live in the 10 homelands, whose ``sovereignty'' is not
recognized abroad.
   The Bophuthatswana army staged a coup in 1988, but South African
sent in troops and blocked the overthrow of the government. In the
past month, unrest has cost six lives and injured dozens of people
in the homeland. Protesters today called for the resignation of
Mangope, who has rejected calls to return the territory to South
Africa.
   All government offices and many businesses, shops and schools in
the area were closed and protesters hijacked buses to take them to
the march, officials said. Many people stayed away from work or
school to support the protests.
   In Ciskei, after widespread rioting and looting broke out, the
new junta declared a state of emergency on and asked for assistance
from South African troops. At least 27 people were killed and 550
injured in the unrest.
   Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo, who heads the junta, said ousted
President Lennox Sebe would be arrested if he attempted to return.
Sebe was on a trade mission in Hong Kong when the military struck.
   Ciskei industrialists said looting and arson that followed the
coup had shattered the economy and destroyed up to 10,000 jobs. Ray
Brentnall, head of the Ciskei Chamber of Industries, said rioting
caused damage worth millions of dollars, but did not give any
overall figure.
   ``People are very upset. After sweating blood to build up their
businesses it's heartbreaking to see them go up in flames,'' he
said.
   The coup in Ciskei was hailed by most people, who detested the
authoritarian Seke regime. But the celebrations that followed
turned to riots and looting, with mobs attacking and burning shops,
factories and businesses.
   Dozens of foreign-owned factories were burned because they were
identified with the old government, which attracted foreign
investment by providing labor at wages of $50 a month or less.
   Gqozo told the state South African Broadcasting Corp. that his
government had begun to release political prisoners held by Sebe.
Gqozo also said the new government would investigate charges of
corruption against the ousted president.
   Human rights groups said Sebe's government had detained hundreds
of dissidents.
   South Africa's pro-apartheid Conservative Party criticized the
South African government for not intervening sooner in Ciskei to
prevent the chaos.
   ``These little stone-throwing, looting arsonist (criminals) are
probably a precursor to the new South Africa,'' said Tom Langley, a
member of Parliament for the Conservatives.
   Since taking office in August, President F.W. de Klerk has made
a series of concessions to blacks in a bid to bring black leaders
into talks on dismantling apartheid and sharing power.
   South Africa established the homelands in an attempt to create
separate, tribal-based states for blacks while whites would retain
control of national politics and the economy.

<TEXT>
   American workers' productivity in the non-farm
portion of the nation's economy last year posted its worst
performance since 1982, improving only 0.9 percent, the government
said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, hourly labor costs _ a major inflation measure for
businesses _ escalated significantly, jumping by 5.4 percent, the
Labor Department said. That increase, up from 4.7 percent in 1988,
was the biggest rise in hourly labor costs since the 1981-82
recession.
   ``That's what happens when you have a slowdown in the economy,
you get squeezed from both ends. The two blades of the scissors _
subdued productivity and higher labor costs _ began to push
together,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for the Northern
Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``There is no real evidence that productivity is going to
escalate any time soon. We're not likely to break out of this vice
in 1990,'' Dederick said.
   The 0.9 percent productivity gain for the year was the same
improvement reported in preliminary figures provided last month, as
was the 0.2 percent productivity gain reported for the
October-December period.
   The Labor Department said the 0.9 percent increase in
productivity _ defined as output per hour of work _ was less than
half the 2 percent gain recorded in 1988.
   The fourth quarter's productivity gain of 0.2 percent was well
below the 2.4 percent gain of the previous quarter.
   Since the end of the 1981-82 recession, productivity growth has
averaged 1.8 percent a year. While a slight improvement over the
1.2 percent average growth in the 1970s, it was still far below the
3.3 percent rate of increase posted in the two decades after World
War II, when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a
rising standard of living.
   Increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their
output rises without risking higher inflation.
   In addition to the large increase in hourly compensation, the
report showed that unit labor costs, another key determinant of
future price inflation, shot up 4.5 percent for the year, compared
with a 2.7 percent increase in 1988. Unit labor costs reflect
changes in compensation as well as changes in productivity.
   Hourly labor costs for the fourth quarter increased by 6
percent, the department said.
   Output in the non-farm portion was up 3.3 percent in 1989 while
the number of hours worked rose by 2.4 percent, giving the 0.9
percent increase in productivity.
   For the fourth quarter, output was unchanged and the number of
hours worked fell by 0.2 percent, the first drop since 1986.
   In the manufacturing sector, productivity grew by 2.8 percent
for both the year and the quarter. During the October-December
period, productivity in the manufacturing of non-durable goods
increased by 8.3 percent to outweigh the 0.4 percent productivity
decline in durable goods, the report said.

   Sikh extremists exploded a grenade and

19 people were killed and 38 wounded, police said.
   Press Trust of India, citing unofficial reports, gave a higher
death toll, saying about 25 people were killed.
   Police Chief K.P.S. Gill, who provided the police casualty
report, said at least 10 gunmen were involved in the attack at 8:15
p.m. in Abohar.
   Another police spokesman said the attackers wore masks and
arrived on foot.
   ``Nobody knows how they escaped,'' he said. Abohar is 125 miles
southwest of Chandigarh and 200 miles northwest of New Delhi.
   Sikh extremists have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
Sikh nation in Punjab state. It is the only state in which Sikhs
form a majority. The great majority of India's 880 million people
are Hindus.
   The Sikh campaign has killed more than 370 people in Punjab this
year.
   Sikh militants, complaining of political discrimination by
Hindus, want to establish a nation called Khalistan, or ``Land of
the Pure,'' in Punjab, a rich northern farming state. The Sikh
faith has roots in both Hinduism and Islam.

<TEXT>
   A renegade Afghan general who tried
to overthrow the government of Afghanistan fled with his family to
Pakistan today, Pakistani and guerrilla sources said, giving weight
to government claims the coup attempt had been crushed.
   Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai, the battle-hardened defense minister
linked to three coup attempts against the Soviet-backed government
in Kabul, flew aboard an Afghan military helicopter with his wife,
two daughters and a son to the frontier town of Peshawar, said the
sources, who demanded anonymity.
   According to guerrilla sources, Tanai left Bagram air base at 2
p.m. Earlier reports said mutineers had seized control of Bagram,
Afghanistan's largest air base. The Afghan government had denied
those reports, and the situation remained unclear late today.
   The sources said Tanai contacted Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a
fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla leader, before fleeing and that one
of Hekmatyar's commanders had been with Tanai since the coup
attempt was launched Tuesday.
   Such an alliance would be more one of convenience and
opportunism than ideology. Tanai, a Marxist hard-liner, has long
advocated a harsh stance against the U.S.-backed guerrillas and
opposed President Najib's attempts to make peace with them.
   At the same time, the radical fundamentalist Hekmatyar has
become increasingly estranged from his fellow Moslem guerrilla
leaders, rejecting their political leadership and executing some of
their followers.
   Pakistan should be a safe haven for Tanai, as its government
strongly opposes the Najib government.
   Earlier today, a foreign diplomat said mutinous soldiers, who
had the support of guerrillas, had seized control of Bagram, 30
miles north of Kabul.
   A government spokesman denied it but acknowledged fighting at
the base.
   Western diplomats and guerrilla leaders in Pakistan said they
also had reports of fighting between rival factions in the southern
city of Kandahar and the northwestern city of Herat.
   The diplomats and guerrilla sources, all speaking on condition
of anonymity, also told of sporadic street fighting in Kabul, the
capital, and said mutinous air force pilots bombed the capital for
a second day but were repulsed by loyalist troops.
   Afghanistan's highest-ranking diplomat in Pakistan, Charge
d'Affaires Qudratullah Ahmadi, denied there was widespread
fighting. ``There is only fighting in Bagram. All of Afghanistan is
quiet,'' he told reporters in Islamabad.
   Of the Bagram battle, Ahmadi said, ``This was a strong
challenge. This was their (the mutineers') last chance.'' He denied
the base had fallen.
   But a foreign diplomat said, ``All indications are that the
mutineers are in control of Bagram.'' The diplomat added: ``Beyond
that, the situation in Afghanistan is exceedingly unclear.''
   Claims made by the Kabul government and the Moslem insurgents
are often exaggerated and impossible to verify independently.
   In a brief speech today on official Radio Kabul, Najib again
claimed victory over the mutineers and said renegade soldiers were
surrendering. ``Tanai has escaped. His allies are defecting, and
those who do not surrender will be punished,'' he said.
   Radio Kabul said troops loyal to Najib controlled Kabul, a city
of 2 million, but urged residents to stay indoors.
   It also accused another high-ranking party member, Asadullah
Sarwari, of involvement in the attempted overthrow. Sarwari was a
former interior minister known as ``the butcher'' for hundreds of
killings following the 1978 revolution that installed the Communist
government.
   The whereabouts of Sarwari was not immediately known.
   Najib, who was installed as president by the Soviets in December
1986, said ``a number of people,'' mostly civilians, had been
killed and injured since Tuesday. He gave no figures.
   The government appealed to supporters to take up arms in
defense. Hekmatyar, leader of one of the most fundamentalist of the
guerrilla groups that took up arms against the government 11 years
ago, claimed six Soviet warplanes joined the government's fight. A
Soviet official denied it.
   Hekmatyar offered his support to the mutineers within hours
after planes began bombing the presidential palace Tuesday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Hekmatyar said Tanai's forces controlled the
Kabul airport today but were under heavy rocket attack.
   Western diplomats and U.N. officials in Pakistan backed the
report and said the Chinese, Italian and Indian embassies had been
slightly damaged.
   Those sources also claimed troops loyal to Najib were pounding
the air base in Bagram, trying to rout Tanai's supporters. Radio
Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said Najib had ordered the air force
to bomb Bagram.
   Guerrilla sources and Pakistani officials claimed three
high-ranking Afghan generals flew a transport plane to the Pakistan
border and surrendered to the guerrillas. One guerrilla source said
the soldiers supported neither side and did not want to stay in
Afghanistan.
   Western diplomats and guerrilla sources said they also had
reports of Afghan helicopters and warplanes landing at towns along
the border. They said they did not know who was on the aircraft.
   Moscow withdrew its soldiers from Afghanistan in February 1989
after a nine-year military intervention in the war, but it
continues to ship arms to the Afghan armed forces.
   Hekmatyar, speaking in Pakistan, claimed Moscow sent six
warplanes from the bordering Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan to
bomb Bagram. He said one Soviet warplane was shot down.
   A political officer at the Soviet Embassy in Islamabad denied
the allegations.
   Tanai and Hekmatyar were linked to at least of two of the five
previous reported attempts to oust Najib, who took office in 1986.
Tanai belongs to a faction of the ruling party that is a bitter
rival of Najib.
   He is said to have had many contacts with Moslem guerrillas who
took up arms after the 1978 coup that brought the Communists to
power.
   Hekmatyar told reporters Tuesday in Islamabad that he supports
any attempt to oust Najib. If a coup succeeded, he said, the
guerrillas would decide whether to negotiate for an Islamic
government or fight Najib's successor.
   Hekmatyar, a 42-year-old engineer, has has been accused by other
resistance groups of killing rival guerrillas and innocent
civilians and broke away from the government-in-exile formed by the
guerrillas after the Soviet withdrawal.

   A former policeman who has
admitted killing anti-apartheid activists said today that during
his eight years on the force he made only one arrest, but kidnapped
and killed often.
   Butana Nofomela testified that he was trained at a special
police base in 1980 to ``kidnap, ambush and shoot'' members of the
African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress, two
black guerrilla groups fighting the white-led government.
   Nofomela, on death row for a killing with no political
overtones, testified in Pretoria at a judicial inquiry into
allegations that the national police and military operated hit
squads against anti-apartheid activists.
   The head of the investigating commission, Supreme Court Justice
Louis Harms, asked Nofomela why he kidnapped people instead of
arresting them.
   ``In most cases, we were not instructed to arrest .... We were
instructed to kidnap,'' Nofomela replied.
   Asked if he arrested anyone during his eight years as a
policeman, Nofomela said, ``Only once. All other times I kidnapped.
I kidnap and kill.''
   Nofomela detailed several killings, including the 1981 stabbing
death of black anti-apartheid attorney Griffiths Mxenge. Earlier
this year, Nofomela pleaded guilty to the killing.
   ``Money benefits were promised to me'' for the killings,
Nofomela said. ``Bonuses were rated on how important the person was
who was to be eliminated or kidnapped.''
   Nofomela provoked a storm of controversy in October when he
confessed, the night before he was scheduled to hang, that he had
participated in police death squads. Nofomela's execution has been
postponed indefinitely while the death squad allegations are being
investigated.
   Two other former policemen, a black man and a white captain,
subsequently acknowledged participating in the alleged hit squads
along with Nofomela, who is black. All three have said they acted
on orders from their superiors.
   Police have denied authorizing murders. However, police have
said they suspect a covert military unit, the Civil Cooperation
Bureau, was involved in the killing of at least two anti-apartheid
figures.
   Activists say they believe the security forces were involved in
the unsolved killings of at least 60 government opponents in the
past decade.
   Maj. Gen. Joep Joubert testified Tuesday that the military
approved plans in 1985 for undercover agents to go abroad and
disrupt ANC operations. Several prominent ANC officials outside
South Africa have been assassinated or had attempts on their lives
in recent years, and the cases have never been solved.
   The ANC and the smaller PAC were legalized last month by
President F.W. de Klerk. Thousands of exiles belonging to the
groups are expected to begin returning to South Africa shortly.
   The military has said the secret bureau had 139 members, an
annual budget of $11 million and was in engaged in highly sensitive
intelligence gathering operations in South Africa and abroad.
   Yet top military and government officials have claimed they had
no knowledge of the bureau until recently.
   No military officers have been charged in connection with the
activities of the bureau, but two men have been detained for
questioning, and police are searching for several former police
officers in connection with two assassinations.

   Kentucky became the 41st state to adopt a
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday when Gov. Wallace Wilkinson signed
legislation before a jubilant crowd in the Capitol rotunda.
   The bill's chief sponsor, freshman Rep. Leonard Gray of
Louisville, called Monday's signing ``the end of a long march.''
   Wilkinson signed the bill at the base of a statue of Abraham
Lincoln during a ceremony punctuated by prayers, applause and, for
many of the assembled veterans of the civil rights movement, tears
of joy.
   Borrowing some rhetoric from the slain civil rights leader,
co-sponsor Rep. Porter Hatcher held a page of the legislation aloft
and said, ``Signed at last; signed at last. Thank God almighty,
it's signed at last.''
   The bill designates the third Monday in January an official
state holiday and grants state employees a day off with pay to
commemorate King's birthday.

<HEAD>Italian Prime Minister Wants U.S. to Keep Troops in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti on
Wednesday encouraged the United States to remain bound to Europe by
keeping troops there as a guarantee of stability.
   Andreotti, addressing a joint session of Congress, also said a
reunited Germany must be anchored in the 16-nation NATO alliance of
Western nations and bound by internationally recognized border
agreements.
   The Italian leader discussed the future of a united Germany and
European concerns about the merger at White House talks Tuesday
with President Bush.
   Andreotti, one of Italy's most enduring politicians who is
serving as prime minister for the sixth time, was greeted with a
prolonged standing ovation by members of the House, Senate and
diplomatic corps.
   The theme of his speech was the changing face of Europe _ one
with reduced superpower arsenals, democratic governments throughout
and an improved quality of life for its inhabitants.
   ``The real issue today is how can we encourage change in the
East without provoking repercussions that would stop its impetus,''
Andreotti said.
   ``A New Deal with the East should first of all include a drastic
reduction of arms, especially conventional weapons which threaten
us Europeans in terms of proximity and continuity,'' he said.
   The United States, Soviet Union and their allies are negotiating
sharp reductions in conventional weapons arsenals. A treaty may be
ready for signing by year's end.
   ``We want to continue building a Europe that is open to the
world, not a fortress Europe as some mistakenly fear,'' he said.
   Italy assumes the chairmanship of the European Economic
Community in July and Andreotti has been assuring the United States
that the process of unifying the markets of the 12 member nations
is not meant to exclude the United States.
   The new Europe will be ``ever ready to collaborate in a spirit
of true partnership with the United States, whose military presence
in Europe must remain ... as a guarantee of stability and
balance,'' Andreotti said.
   ``Moreover, we want this new Europe that is being built to
develop new and increasingly close and effective forms of linkage
with this essential partner nation.''
   Italy and other West European countries are concerned the United
States might reduce its commitment to Europe in response to the
declining danger from the Soviet Union and the rising influence a
united Germany is expected to wield.
   A reunited Germany, which is expected to emerge by the end of
the year, ``has an essential anchorage in NATO and a secure
guarantee in the larger assembly'' of the 35 signatories of the
Helsinki agreements, he said. The 1975 agreements ratified the
European borders set after World War II.
   Italy and other European countries are worried that a united
Germany might lay claim to lands taken away from the vanquished
Germany of Adolf Hitler. Poland has been especially worried because
one-third of its territory used to be German.
   Andreotti has also voiced concerns that Italy and other NATO
allies might be overlooked in the ``two-plus-four'' approach to
German unification. The ``two-plus-four'' are the two Germanys and
the four World War II victors _ the United States, Great Britain,
France and the Soviet Union.
   Andreotti received assurances from his U.S. hosts that Italy
would not be ignored in the discussions expected to begin later
this month.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Says Pentagon Still Pays Too Much for Many Items</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force spent $81,397 on a C-5A cargo
plane pilot seat when a similar model was available for about
$16,000, a lawmaker said Wednesday in accusing the Pentagon of
continuing to buy overpriced spare parts.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also criticized the Defense
Department's procurement chief, John Betti, for his order to
civilian auditors discouraging the withholding of program funds if
they suspected waste, fraud, abuse or mismanagement by a contractor.
   Under the Jan. 28 directive, Betti said he or his deputy would
have the authority to withhold payments to contractors to ensure
that the step is taken only when absolutely necessary.
   ``It in no way indicates any reduction in my desire for
disciplined and responsive management of our acquisition
programs,'' Betti said in the order. ``Rather, it signals my belief
that self-disciplined and responsible program managers are a more
responsive and cost-effective control system than are a series of
hierarchical reviews.''
   But Boxer told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference that
Betti took away the ``one main tool'' that had been given to
civilian auditors.
   ``I think he is bowing to the demands of the services as opposed
to the civilian side,'' she said.
   The congresswoman, in a letter released Wednesday, urged Betti
to rescind his order, saying his decision ``sends the wrong signal
to defense contractors and those in the services responsible for
programs''
   Boxer, who in the mid-1980s disclosed the Pentagon paid $7,400
for a coffee brewer and $539 for arm rests, used the news
conference to show that the public and congressional outcry has
forced the department to buy similiar items at a cheaper price.
   The Air Force recently spent $283 on a commercial coffee maker
for its C-5 aircraft and is repairing damaged arm rests for a mere
$25.
   However, the Pentagon is ``still blowing taxpayers' money on
spare parts,'' Boxer said.
   ``We have found other parts outside the glare of publicity where
the Air Force had returned to its old ways of accepting overcharges
on spare parts,'' she said.
   But Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said that ``across
the board, the Pentagon was making progress in keeping prices
down.''
   In 1988, the Air Force bought one Weber-manufactured pilot seat
for $81,397 for the C-5A aircraft and eight more seats at $29,476
each. But for the C-5B aircraft, the Air Force bought $16,047 seats
made by IPECO.
   ``The Air Force says the Weber and IPECO seats are
interchangeable,'' Boxer said.
   In addition, the Air Force purchased 4,000 eight-day clocks at a
cost of $596 each. But a supplier contacted by the Project for
Government Procurement said it could supply clocks meeting the same
specifications for $270 each, Boxer said.

<HEAD>Sudan Faces Crisis as Refugee Influx Climbs, Foreign Aid Falls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sudan's top relief official said his
nation may be forced to reconsider its liberal relief policies if
foreign aid does not increase to match a growing influx of
Ethiopian refugees.
   Refugee Commissioner Abdul-Rahman Sir el-Khatem also appealed
for worldwide pressure to help persuade Ethiopia to allow delivery
of relief supplies inside its borders to help slow the flood of
refugees crossing the frontier.
   Sir el-Khatem said 11,800 Ethiopian refugees fled to eastern
Sudan in the last week of February, bringing to 35,800 the number
of new arrivals in that month.
   Foreign officials said they expect tens of thousands of new
refugees in the coming weeks and Sir el-Khatem's office already
counts 1.2 million refugees in Sudan, mostly Ethiopians.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees disputed the figures and
said no more than 800,000 refugees were in Sudan.
   It was unclear what action Sudan could take to halt the refugees
who cross the huge, mostly unmarked and unguarded border to escape
war and famine.
   ``Assistance from the international community to refugees in
Sudan is decreasing, while the influx across Sudan's eastern border
is increasing,'' Sir el-Khatem was quoted as saying by the
government newspaper Al-Sudan Al-Hadith.
   He said budget cuts at the U.N. relief organization led to a 50
percent reduction in spending at its Khartoum office which ``might
force us to change our permanent policy towards refugees.''
   In eastern Sudan Sir el-Khatem's office operates six
U.N.-financed reception camps and 16 settlements for refugees. Many
still house people who fled the 1984-85 famine in Ethiopia that is
believed to have killed a million people.
   Sir el-Khatem did not spell out what steps Sudan is likely to
take if more refugee aid does not arrive.
   He also said Sudan will allow relief agencies to transport food
through Sudanese territory and across the frontier into Ethiopia.

   Iran's president today said the problem
of the Western hostages held in Lebanon is nearing a solution, but
a group holding two Americans said it has no intention of freeing
the captives.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization also accused the United
States of planning a military operation to free the hostages and
said, ``We warn America away from what it calls the hard option
because we are on alert. We are today stronger and better prepared
and more determined to hit out at strategic interests and deal
painful blows.''
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said his country was not
directly linked to the hostage issue but had pledged to use Iran's
influence to seek their freedom.
   ``My feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving toward
a solution,'' Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
him as saying.
   He repeated Iran's demands that Western nations help trace
Iranian hostages missing in Lebanon and ``also reduce their
mischievous acts,'' IRNA said.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are missing in
Lebanon, most believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to
Tehran. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Rafsanjani's statements at a news conference followed a series
of editorials in English-language newspapers in Tehran saying the
hostages should be freed because they were being used as
anti-Islamic propoganda. Syrian and other officials also have
expressed optimism that the hostages may be freed.
   In a hand-written statement issued today, Revolutionary Justice
said, ``We tenaciously cling to keeping America's nose in the mud
under our feet. There is no intention to release hostages.'' The
statement was accompanied by a black-and-white instant photograph
of American hostage Joseph Cicippio, of Valley Forge, Penn. It was
delivered to the Beirut newspaper An-Nahar and a Western news
agency.
   Cicippio, acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. Revolutionary Justice also
claims to hold Edward Austin Tracy, an American author from
Vermont. The date of his seizure is not known, but the group made
the claim of responsibility Oct. 21, 1986.
   ``By monitoring American moves here and there and through
planting elements in regional American stations, and after trailing
some spies, we have acquired accurate information that an American
military operation is imminent against areas where the Americans
believe hostages are held,'' the Arabic statement said.
   ``We call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware
and be on the alert against what America is hatching,'' the
communique added.
   In apparent reference to recent comments by Lebanon's most
influential Shiite Moslem cleric, the statement said, ``the
Revolutionary Justice Organization holds spies, and humanitarianism
requires just punishment, not a reward.'' It did not elaborate.
   The cleric, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, said in a sermon
Feb. 23 that ``We have to think of finding a realistic and
humanitarian means to free the foreign hostages.''
   Fadlallah is spiritual guide of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding the
captives.
   Revolutionary Justice said it issued its communique after ``a
comprehensive study of audio and printed statements and reactions
about the hostages question and some issues and developments in the
region.''
   On Tuesday, the Tehran Times said 1990 would be the last year
for captivity for the hostages and that a resumption of ties to the
United States was not a condition for their release.
   Several newspapers also have said the United States and Iran
were negotiating over the fate of the hostages, which Washington
has denied.
   Rafsanjani denied that any such talks had occurred, according to
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   The president said the only official talks between the two
nations are those carried out under the U.S.-Iran claims tribunal
in the Netherlands, under the auspices of the International Court
of Justice.
   The tribunal is sorting out billions of dollars in claims from
contracts broken following the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   But he said the U.S. officials ``themselves have established
contacts with regional governments.'' That was an apparent
reference to U.S. contacts with Syria, which as the main power
broker in Lebanon has facilitated past hostage releases. Diplomatic
sources in the Syrian capital, Damascus, have said the United
States used Syria as an intermediary with Tehran.
   Rafsanjani's brother Mahmoud Hashemi, a high-ranking foreign
ministry official, was in Damascus this week for meetings with the
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk Al-Sharaa.
   A Syrian source said the talks were to coordinate policy on
getting the hostages released and that Hashemi had arrived from
Beirut, where he also discussed the hostage issue with senior
Shiite Moslem clergy.
   Rafsanjani echoed the recent Tehran Times editorials in saying
the hostages should be released because their captivity was being
used to smear the reputation of the Islamic faith and the Lebanese.
   He also referred to recent statements by Fadlallah and the
Tehran editorials as indicating there was new hope for the captives.
   Rafsanjani has indicated the desire to separate Iran from the
hostage issue as he seeks Western technology and financing to
rebuild Iran's troubled economy. But the factions holding the
hostages are said more loyal to radicals in the Tehran government
who oppose Rafsanjani, viewing confrontation with the West as the
wellspring of the Islamic revolution.

   Four bodyguards of Nicolae Ceausescu
were acquitted Wednesday of charges they helped the deposed
dictator try to flee during the December revolution, state
television said.
   Maj. Aurel David, Maj. Florian Rat, Capt. Marian Rusu and
Paulica Tanase were accused of securing a helicopter Dec. 22 which
took Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, from Communist Party
headquarters to Snagov, 20 miles north of Bucharest, and then
arranging a move to Ploiesti, 35 miles north of the capital. No
rank was given for Tanase.
   All four were members of Ceausescu's Securitate secret police,
which was officially disbanded after the revolution. The verdict
was reported on television without any details.
   Acquittals have been rare in the trials of former Securitate
agents accused of crimes under Ceausescu's 24-year tenure or during
the revolution that pitted secret police remnants against the army
and civilian freedom fighters.
   In Timisoara, where the revolution began, 21 Securitate officers
are on trial on charges arising from the mass shootings of unarmed
demonstrators.

   Oliver North will be the government's leadoff
witness at John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial and Poindexter's
lawyers are trying to limit the former White House aide's
testimony, the judge in the case disclosed today.
   Ten additional people were sent into a pool of prospective
jurors, making a total of 45, and the jury for the trial was to be
chosen this afternoon. It will consist of 12 people, plus six
alternates.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said he understood that
North ``will be the first government witness'' in Poindexter's
trial. Lawyers in the case later confirmed that North would be the
first witness.
   Greene made the comment as he announced that Poindexter's
lawyers are trying to limit North's potentially damaging testimony.
North met frequently with Poindexter on the Iran arms sale
initiative, resupply of the Contras and the diversion of funds to
the rebel force.
   Greene said he would consider a motion filed under seal by
Poindexter that seeks to limit some aspects of North's testimony,
based on Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
   Greene denied another motion by Poindexter that would have
struck all or part of North's upcoming testimony.
   The government alleged at North's trial last year that he had
given unreliable testimony when he took the witness stand in his
own defense, Richard Beckler, a lawyer for Poindexter, said in
explaining the basis for the motion.
   Opening statements are to be Thursday morning and North could be
on the stand for several days.
   One of those picked for the pool Tuesday was a retired Defense
Department employee who may have confused the Watergate scandal
with the Iran-Contra affair.
   Asked what last year's trial of North focused on, the Defense
Department retiree, a woman who worked at the Army Materiel Command
in Alexandria, Va., said it was ``about the tapes. He had so many
tapes he did erase, Oliver North and secretary.''
   In the Watergate scandal, then-President Nixon's secretary Rose
Mary Woods said she might have accidentally erased a portion of one
taped conversation. The tape in question was of a conversation
between Nixon and his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, about how to
handle the spreading FBI investigation of the Watergate scandal.
   Also sent into the jury pool was a distribution clerk at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington, who said he had heard
that North ``was going to court,'' but didn't know the outcome of
last year's trial in which Poindexter's one-time subordinate was
convicted of three felonies.
   Asked whether he had heard of Poindexter, the man said that if
he had, ``I ... didn't pay any attention.''
   One juror was excused for failing to note on a questionnaire
that she had sat on a jury previously, a fact that came out during
questioning.
   Greene noted there had been ``a big flap'' at North's trial last
year over a juror who had answered the questionnaire incorrectly.
The juror in the North case, Tara King, failed to note the fact
that a number of relatives had been involved in criminal cases,
including one who served time in prison. The issue is part of
North's appeal, now before the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   A truck driver who said ``I read the paper a lot'' was
disqualified for jury duty after telling Greene that Poindexter
``might be guilty'' and saying of Reagan:
   ``I know he was in on it, but I don't know if he did anything
wrong.''
   Poindexter is under indictment on charges of conspiracy, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements. The charges relate to allegations that Poindexter
covered up North's secret resupply network to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua and to allegations that Poindexter lied concerning a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk antiaircraft missiles to Iran.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's Cabinet has evolved into the
most powerful in a quarter century even though it meets
infrequently, insiders and analysts suggest.
   When it does convene, two things distinquish it from Cabinet
sessions under former President Reagan: The vice president speaks
out and there's no mistaking who's the secretary of Housing and
Urban Development.
   The full Bush Cabinet gets together only about once a month, but
in some months it hasn't met at all. The meetings seldom last more
than an hour and usually are held in response to some event or trip.
   For instance, Bush called his Cabinet together Monday to report
on his California summit with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
and to discuss the recent Nicaraguan election.
   But Bush's 14-member Cabinet may wield more power and have more
influence with the president than any since President Eisenhower's
in the 1950s. At the same time, Bush's White House staff is one of
the least powerful of recent presidencies, analysts suggest and
some top Bush aides agree.
   While Eisenhower met with his Cabinet almost once a week, Bush
met with his full Cabinet only 11 times last year and three times
so far this year.
   One reason he gathers his Cabinet so infrequently is that he
knows the members so well. Some of them _ Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady _ are among his oldest friends.
   ``He doesn't use the full Cabinet as a decision-making body,''
said David Q. Bates, who as Cabinet secretary schedules sessions,
prepares the agenda and keeps the president informed of agency
developments.
   Bush constantly telephones Cabinet secretaries. And, Bates said,
he often meets individually with them _ such as a lunch he had
Wednesday with Mosbacher _ reducing the need for more frequent
full-Cabinet meetings.
   The secretaries can call matters to the president's attention by
slipping a note into Bates' weekly report to Bush on what each
Cabinet agency is doing.
   Roger Porter, Bush's domestic policy adviser who also worked in
the Reagan White House, said that Reagan _ who once failed to
recognize his own reticient housing secretary, Samuel Pierce, at a
gathering of mayors _ also held infrequent Cabinet meetings,
particularly near the end of his term.
   ``The frequency of Cabinet meetings tends to deteriorate over
time,'' Porter said.
   There's little chance Bush would fail to recognize his housing
secretary, Jack Kemp. According to White House aides, Kemp is one
of the most forceful and frequent speakers at Cabinet sessions,
often dominating the conversations.
   In fact, several White House aides suggested privately that the
irrepressible Kemp's outspokenness may be one reason Bush doesn't
convene the full Cabinet more often. Kemp does not fit into the
old-friend category.
   Does Kemp talk too much at Cabinet meetings? ``Not at all,''
said Kemp spokesman Robert Nipp. ``But he does talk.''
   Another major difference between the Bush and Reagan Cabinets,
White House aides say: Vice President Dan Quayle frequently speaks
up.
   During Reagan Cabinet meetings, Vice President Bush seldom did.
   Bush has retained a Cabinet structure set up in the Reagan
presidency in which two sub-Cabinet groups _ the Domestic Policy
Council and the Economic Policy Council _ meet frequently on major
policy issues.
   The economic group includes the secretaries of treasury,
commerce, agriculture, labor, transportation, state and the trade
representative. The domestic group includes the attorney general
and secretaries of interior, energy, health and human services,
education, veterans affairs and housing and urban development.
   Budget Director Richard Darman sits on both councils. Kemp
doesn't, but usually shows up at both anyway.
   Those councils, augmented by the National Security Council, are
where the bulk of the administration's top policy decisions are
forged _ not within the White House staff. Bush frequently drops in
on the council sessions.
   With the exception of chief of staff John Sununu and Darman, few
on the White House staff wield much real power, senior White House
officials say privately.
   Stuart Eizenstat, a Washington lawyer who was President Carter's
domestic policy adviser, said Bush's Cabinet ``is stronger relative
to the White House staff than any recent Cabinet.''
   Bush ``broke the mold'' by putting his closest friends in the
Cabinet instead of on the White House staff, Eizenstat said.
   Reagan brought a whole retinue of California cronies to the
White House and Carter gave many of his Georgia friends top White
House positions. By contrast, few on Bush's White House staff have
known or worked with him for more than several years.
   Eizenstat said Carter's Cabinet met about once a week at the
start and then about once every two weeks. But he said Carter
didn't rely much on the sessions for making decisions.
   ``Cabinet meetings are not terribly illuminating sessions. You
don't want to have your secretary of agriculture voting on whether
to have an MX or Midgetman missile system,'' Eizenstat said.

<HEAD>Snack Survey: One of Three Americans Feels Guilty About the
Munchies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   One in three people suffer pangs of guilt along
with pangs of hunger for a snack, and 11 percent said they feel
guiltier quenching their craving for the munchies than cheating on
their taxes, a survey has found.
   The survey, released Wednesday, was conducted for Continental
Baking Co., the maker of Twinkies, Hostess Cupcakes and Ho Hos.
   A random sample of 1,000 people over age 18 were contacted by
telephone during the weekend of Feb. 2 and asked about their
snacking habits and what bothered people more than snacking.
   Other findings included: 10 percent said they feel more guilt
snacking than lying to their spouse about how much money they
spend, and 18 percent said they would feel less guilt lying about
their weight than grabbing a snack.
   Dr. Felix Larocca, whose medical practice specializes in dieting
and eating disorders, said the results add more evidence to how
strong the temptation to eat sweets and desserts is in modern
society.
   ``It's 10 a.m. in the morning and you may be at work and you may
be hungry. Why not have an apple? Instead you'll probably eat a
luscious pastry and while you do it talk about how you need to lose
a few pounds,'' said Larocca.
   ``Snacks are the forbidden fruit,'' said Larocca, who has
operated a St. Louis-based program for mood and eating disorders
since 1983.
   But a spokesman for the Snack Food Association said it doesn't
seem fair to single out snack foods for their association with
guilt.
   ``There's no reason that people should feel guilty about
snacking,'' said Al Rickard, spokesman for the Alexandria,
Va.-based group. ``We've always maintained that snacks should be
eaten as part of an appropriate diet.''
   Despite the guilt, what will the average person give up to savor
a snack?
   According to the survey, 40 percent would rather snack than
shop; 18 percent would rather snack than travel; 29 percent would
rather snack than go to the movies; and 10 percent would rather
snack than make love.
   The survey was conducted by Bruskin Associates and had a margin
of error of 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Chiang Kai-Shek's Sole Surviving Son Thrust Into Limelight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chiang Wego, the sole surviving son of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, has emerged as a wild card in the
upcoming presidential election as his father's aging cronies dream
of re-establishing the family dynasty.
   ``Gen. Chiang is still highly respected by our mainland
compatriots,'' said Teng Chieh, a prominent member of the electoral
college that will chose a new president March 21.
   The attention focusing on Chiang Wego, a 73-year-old retired
general, has come quickly after a career spent in the shadow of his
father and elder brother, Chiang Ching-kuo, who together led the
Nationalist Chinese government for six decades, first in China and
then in Taiwan.
   His political star did not rise measurably when his brother died
in 1988 and was succeeded by his handpicked vice president, Lee
Teng-hui.
   But President Lee is shakily approaching his first major
political test in which he must win the approval of the 752-seat
National Assembly, or electoral college, to secure a six-year term.
   Although Lee already has received the ruling Nationalist Party
endorsement, the assembly is dominated by aging politicians who
escaped to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 after losing a civil
war to the Communists. They still dream of returning victoriously
to the Chinese mainland.
   The old guard assemblyman have not faced election since arriving
in Taiwan and have been frozen in office to support the Nationalist
claim to still be the legitimate government of all China.
   While Chiang Wego shares their dream of returning to the
mainland, Lee is a pragmatic Taiwan-born politician more concerned
with ruling this island of 20 million people.
   About 200 assemblymen have defied Lee's choice of a top aide as
running mate by openly supporting Chiang for vice president. Many
of them actually want Chiang to be president but realize that a
Taiwanese must fill the top slot for political reasons.
   Chiang has responded by saying he would not actively seek the
presidency or vice presidency, but he added that ``there is nothing
I can do to control the assemblymen.'' He has refused to rule out
accepting either position.
   He also has accused media of misinterpreting remarks made in
1985 by his brother, who said: ``If someone asks me whether anyone
in my family would run for the next presidential term, my reply is,
`It can't be and it won't be.'''
   The statement was widely viewed as referring to all relatives,
but Chiang Wego has claimed his brother was only referring to his
sons.
   Lee is taking the challenge seriously and has scrambled to meet
with assemblymen to shore up support. The power struggle has
stirred up ``the most serious political crisis in 40 years,'' said
Lu Ya-li, history professor at National Taiwan University.
   Among Chiang's critics is the liberal weekly magazine
Journalist, which said in an editorial that his activities exposed
``his backward thoughts, muddled head, unrestrained mind, and weak
will.''
   Other critics say Chiang still lives in the conservative past
and has ignored calls for greater democracy.
   Most Taiwanese view the aging mainland Chinese assemblyman as an
obstacle to democratic change and want them to be replaced by
Taiwan-elected politicians. But Chiang has praised their refusal to
step down.
   As local industrialists press for direct trade with China,
Chiang claims Chinese Communists are trying to destabilize Taiwan
through growing trade.
   Chiang Wego was born in Shanghai on Oct. 6, 1916. Some reports
claim that he was the adopted son of Chiang Kai-shek and that his
real father was Tai Chi-tao, the generalissimo's close friend.
   ``I dont't really know which is my father, but I am happy to be
the son of either of them,'' he once said.
   Chiang likes to socialize, swap jokes, and sing popular songs at
public gatherings. He has practiced Chinese boxing since he was a
child and learned to fly helicopter at age 70.
   Educated in prestigious military academies in Germany and the
United States, Chiang joined the Nationalist Chinese Army as
lieutenant at 25.
   He was assigned to several administrative positions and served
as lieutenant general for 14 years until being promoted to full
general in 1985, one year before retiring. He is secretary general
of the National Security Council, widely viewed as a symbolic seat
with little power.
   Many believe Chiang Kai-shek prevented his son's career from
advancing quicker to avoid criticism of nepotism. Others believe
that Chiang Wego just was not qualified to tackle key postings.
   ``He is a nice man to make friends with, but not the type of
person who fits the post of vice presidency,'' said Chang
Chung-tung, a history professor at National Taiwan University.
   Noting the trend toward democratic reform since martial law was
lifted in 1987 after 38 years, Chang believes the days of the
Chiang dynasty are over and that the Taiwanese people would never
accept another family member to rule.

<TEXT>
   Authorities today were investigating
whether a bomb or a methane gas buildup caused an explosion that
flattened a two-story bank building ``like an accordion,'' killing
three people and injuring 14.
   A 12-member team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms began assembling this morning in this Rocky Mountain ski
resort to search for clues in the rubble of Crested Butte State
Bank.
   The building _ except the vault _ was leveled by the blast.
Firefighters and volunteers dug by hand through the rubble to pull
out survivors. Heavy snow hampered rescue efforts and delayed the
arrival of ambulances.
   Police Chief Hank Smith said two restaurants had received bomb
threats in the past week, and one of them was evacuated.
   ``I'm not ruling out a bomb, and I'm not ruling out an explosion
from methane buildup,'' he said. ``We're just now beginning the
investigation.''
   Bank executive vice president Cliff Goss said the bank hadn't
received any bomb threats.
   ``This came completely out of the blue,'' he said. ``We care
about our co-workers and we're not going to work in that situation.
People lost their children and their mothers, and I personally lost
three good friends.''
   Dick Schussler, an FBI spokesman in Denver, said sabotage was a
possibility, but he didn't know of a motive. ``It's not like this
is a bank that's financing South Africa,'' he said.
   The explosion occurred at 9:15 a.m., shortly after the bank
opened.
   Goss opened a temporary bank in a nearby building today and said
it would be able to handle most transactions. A retired bank
employee and several people from a Colorado Springs data processing
center helped out.
   Three bank employees were in listed serious condition today at a
Grand Junction hospital, including bank President Thom Cox.
   ``I saw the second-floor windows blown out and the roof going up
in the air,'' said a businessman across the street who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Then the side walls started to blow out, and the front seemed
to come out, breaking in half, with the top coming out and the
bottom folding like an accordion.''
   Bank employee Lucy Zavala was working in her second-floor office
when she ``thought someone had fallen out of their chair. Then I
was just falling. I ended up in a fetal position, and could see
some light, and then almost immediately heard voices. Somebody
dragged me out, and I thought it was a dream.''
   ``I felt the floor drop beneath me,'' said teller Joe Sabino,
who was treated for scratches and burns on his hands.
``Fortunately, nothing came into contact with me. It (the rubble)
built a little cave around me.''
   Killed were bank employees Donna Smith, 33, Jade Woelk and
Monica Henning, all of Crested Butte. Authorities hopep to learn
more about the blast from autopsies on the victims, said Gunnison
County Coroner C.J. Miller.
   Dusty Demerson ran over from his photography shop about a block
from the bank to help in the rescue. ``The president of the bank
... was hanging out the back of the bank by his legs and we got him
down,'' he said.
   Bob Gillen, spokesman the Crested Butte ski area, said the
resort handled rescue operations as if it were an avalanche. ``We
have some heavy equipment there, but most of the rescuers are using
their hands,'' he said.
   Crested Butte, population about 1,000, is 9,000 feet high in the
western Colorado mountains.

<HEAD>Arrington Says Civil Rights Bill Would Shorten Job Bias Litigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birmingham, Ala., Mayor Richard Arrington
urged senators Wednesday to approve a new civil rights bill and
help his city end 16 years of costly litigation over its hiring and
promotion practices.
   Arrington told the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
the ``terrible financial burden on the city'' from the court battle
will continue indefinitely unless Congress overturns a Supreme
Court decision last year on affirmative action.
   The Supreme Court ruled white Birmingham firefighters may
challenge a court-approved 1981 agreement between the city, the
Justice Department and black workers giving preferential treatment
to minorities and women in city jobs.
   The proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990 would overturn that ruling
by permitting workers to challenge employment practices from court
orders or consent decress only if they did not know about or were
denied a chance to challenge the orders beforehand.
   ``We are not here seeking a license to engage in unlawful
reverse discrimination,'' Arrington testified. ``We are not here
seeking to gag the objections, legitimate or otherwise, of white
employees to affirmative action.''
   But Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., attorney for the white
firefighters, told the committee Congress should let the ruling
stand, saying the court had reaffirmed ``the fundamental
principle... that all Americans are entitled to a day in court when
they believed they have been wronged.''
   Fitzpatrick hinted any legislation to reverse the court ruling
would lead to another prolonged legal battle over its
constitutionality.
   He said the 1981 agreement, approved by a federal judge, has
never been reviewed by an appeals court. ``The city has spent nine
years trying to block a court from reviewing its decree,'' he said.
   Arrington said the new bill would guarantee everyone in hiring
bias disputes ``the right to a day in court'' but would still allow
cities and other employers the right to ``finality in litigation.''

<TEXT>
   Money, sex and prominent names have become
the talk of the town in this staid Midwestern city since a credit
union failure spawned federal and state investigations and rumors
of child prostitution.
   James Martin Davis, an attorney who has been involved in the
case, recently warned that Omaha could be ``the first city in the
history of the world to gossip itself to death.''
   No charges have been filed in connection with the sexual abuse
and child prostitution allegations that began to circulate just
weeks after the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union closed on
Nov. 4, 1988. But the credit union is missing $39 million and a
former manager is to stand trial.
   Since then, a newspaper columnist facing unrelated child sex
assault charges has resigned. A former publisher and civic leader
has spoken out. Grand juries are at work.
   The saga began when federal regulators, citing unsound fiscal
practices, closed the credit union, which was organized to help
north Omaha's poor.
   Soon, stories began surfacing of alleged sexual abuse at parties
thrown by credit union officials.
   The rumors received new life earlier this year when a former
legislator wrote a memo naming five prominent people who he said
were the focus of allegations that could be heard in bars or barber
shops. The memo was eventually leaked to thousands of people.
   Last weekend, retired Omaha World-Herald Publisher Harold
Andersen, who served on an advisory board for the credit union, had
enough.
   He issued a statement acknowledging his name had been raised in
rumors and saying there was ``not a shred of truth'' to the
allegations.
   His statement came one day after an Omaha television station
reported that Andersen and four other people were named in a
federal grand jury subpoena seeking information from an
investigator for a legislative committee probing Franklin.
   In December 1988, the Legislature's Executive Board received
information in a closed hearing from the state Foster Care Review
Board on allegations of abuse of foster children at parties thrown
by Franklin officials.
   A New York Times story based on information submitted to the
Executive Board described the alleged sexual incidents as
``reminiscent of slave auctions.''
   State Sen. Ernie Chambers, the Executive Board vice chairman,
said that was ``a genteel way of characterizing it.''
   But last year, Omaha police and the FBI said their
investigations indicated there was no substance to the allegations.
The state attorney general and the State Patrol agreed.
   The Legislature's Franklin committee questioned whether the
allegations were adequately investigated.
   In December, committee chairman Loran Schmit said the panel had
21 hours of videotaped statements from three ``victim-witnesses''
who said they were sexually abused.
   Now, a state grand jury is investigating allegations of child
sexual abuse and child prostitution. A federal grand jury already
has investigated alleged financial wrongdoing that led to
Franklin's failure and another is ready to investigate the child
sexual abuse allegations.
   Former state Sen. John DeCamp, now a lobbyist, said his memo
listing the five names forced state Attorney General Robert Spire
to seek a state grand jury investigation.
   The news media did not report the names in DeCamp's memo, but a
potential legislative candidate obtained a copy and mailed the
contents to 10,000 Omaha households.
   After World-Herald columnist Peter Citron was arrested Feb. 23
on two counts of child sexual abuse unrelated to Franklin, his
attorney told reporters that the 50-year-old writer was named in
the DeCamp memo.
   ``We're suffering here in Omaha under a firestorm of suspicion,
and we have hurricane-force rumors,'' said his attorney, Davis, who
warned about the gossip.
   Citron has denied any involvement in Franklin-related matters
but has resigned.
   As for the money missing from the credit union, the National
Credit Union Administration filed a lawsuit against Lawrence E.
King Jr., Franklin's manager, alleging that he diverted money from
Franklin for his personal use and for his businesses.
   King, a wealthy black businessman who sang the national anthem
at the 1984 Republican National Convention, is scheduled for trial
in June on 40 counts charging conspiracy, fraud and filing false
tax returns.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Inter American Press Association
on Wednesday praised Nicaragua and Panama for restoring press
freedom, but said journalists' lives remain threatened in Colombia
and elsewhere in the American hemisphere.
   The association, which groups 1,400 newspapers, magazines and
broadcasters in the Americas, declared at its congress here that
``a free press' triumph has been most rewarding'' in Panama and
Nicaragua.
   In Panama, independent newspapers have reopened following last
December's U.S. invasion that overthrew dictator Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Nicaraguan publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose
newspaper La Prensa struggled to operate under the leftist
Sandinista government, is now Nicaragua's president-elect after the
victory of her 14-party coalition over the Sandinistas in elections
Feb. 25.
   Mrs. Chamorro pledged total press freedom. In addition,
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega told the IAPA Tuesday that in
his last days in office, he will liberalize news media laws and
permit private TV broadcasting.
   The Sandinistas, who will become Nicaragua's largest single
opposition party, are likely to be among the chief beneficiaries of
the move.
   The IAPA congress also declared its solidarity with Colombian
journalists threatened by violence from that nation's drug lords.
Nineteen Colombian newspaper employees were killed by suspected
drug traffickers last year, and two have died so far in 1990.
   IAPA also declared that ``repression of the press in Cuba is
grave and extreme,'' and expressed concern over the jailing of
Cuban human rights activists, accused of giving false information
to foreign journalists.
   IAPA said seven journalists died in recent months while covering
fighting in El Salvador between President Alfredo Cristiani's
conservative government and leftist guerrillas.
   It noted reports that guerrillas killed five press employees
during their offensive in November, and said the armed forces and
extreme-right groups have also intimidated the media.
   In a report on the United States, the association said the
Pentagon failed to cooperate adequately with the pool of U.S.
reporters it took to Panama to cover the U.S. invasion.
   ``The current Pentagon,'' IAPA said, ``seems institutionally
profoundly suspicious of the press.''

   A crowded subway train derailed and crashed
into tunnel support beams this morning, shearing a car in half,
killing three people and injuring at least 119 others, authorities
said.
   Five people carried from the tunnel were listed in critical
condition at hospitals.
   The city medical examiner's office said a man and a woman were
killed. Hahnemann Hospital spokeswoman Linda Clossey said a third
woman who died this afternoon arrived in critical condition after
her right leg was amputated to free her from the wreckage. She also
had severe chest injuries and a broken left leg, Clossey said.
   A mobile surgical team worked with rescuers and evaluated the
conditions of trapped passengers as they were freed, police
Commissioner Willie Williams said.
   The victims' names were not immediately released.
   There was no information on the cause of the derailment,
Williams said.
   James Sweeney, a transit inspector, said the train hit three
tunnel support beams. He said a preliminary inspection did not
indicate any danger of a cave-in.
   ``The second and third cars were bent and the whole side of the
second car was torn off like it was peeled like a sardine can and
the floor was ripped out,'' said passenger Mark Robinson, who was
going home after getting off work as a cashier.
   ``I saw people pinned in the car, and they couldn't move and yet
no one was hollering, and that was odd,'' said Robinson.
   Conductor Steven Young said there was standing room only on the
six-car train when it ``suddenly pitched to the left.'' He said he
watched as a tunnel support beam punctured the side of the car.
   ``There were some people sitting there and they got crushed,''
Young said. ``One (man) was alive and I watched him die. I tried to
comfort him.''
   Passenger Gene Paul Henry said the train started shaking just
before the accident.
   The train was headed to the city's western residential areas and
connections to suburban bus and trolley lines when it derailed just
after 8:30 a.m. It had just left the 30th Street stop, a major
downtown station connecting the city subway with Amtrak and
regional commuter trains, said Jim Whitaker, Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority spokesman.
   Presbyterian Medical Center said it received 53 injured, the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania reported 40, Hahnemann
Hospital reported 14 in addition to the woman who died, the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia had six, Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital had five and Pennsylvania Hospital reported one.

   The federal government's Export-Import Bank
announced Wednesday it will begin lending to Czechoslovakia for the
first time since 1946.
   It said the bank's board of directors approved Czechoslovakia
for all the agency's programs, including subsidized loans and
guarantees of private bank loans to help other countries import
U.S. goods.
   ``I am delighted to announce that, as of today, Ex-Im Bank can
be a major participant in the process of increasing U.S. exports to
this major Central European democracy,'' Chairman John D. Macomber
said in a statement.
   Among countries formerly under hard-line Communist rule, the
bank was already doing business with Hungary and Yugoslavia. It
recently announced that it was ready to issue insurance on
short-term trade loans to Poland, although not yet to make loans or
guarantees.
   The bank cannot lend to the Soviet Union, East Germany, Romania
or Bulgaria until President Bush waives the Jackson-Vanik
amendment, which limits U.S. business relations with countries that
restrict emigration.
   Bush announced a waiver for Czechoslovakia last month during the
visit of President Vaclav Havel.
   The bank said it would support loans to and loans guaranteed by
the Czechoslovak Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of
Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak Commercial Bank.

   Author Stephen King may be a master of
the macabre, but he's not so bad at one-liners.
   ``People want to know why I do this, why I write such gross
stuff,'' King told 2,300 fans at City Hall on Tuesday night. ``I
like to tell them I have the heart of a small boy, and I keep it in
a jar on my desk.''
   King, who was taking part in the city library's centennial
celebrations, said some people pay psychiatrists to tell them
``their most twisted fantasies.''
   ``I, on the other hand, write them down, and they pay me. It's a
great way to live,'' said the author of such chillers as
``Carrie,'' ``The Shining,'' ``The Dead Zone,'' and ``Cujo.''
   ``People want to know if I have nightmares,'' he said. ``Of
course not. I give them to you.''
   Then there are those who are curious about King's reading habits.
   ``Somebody will walk up to you, usually in a restaurant _ I
usually read a book when I eat _ and say, `How come you're not
reading one of your own?'
   ``Think about it. Because I know how they come out. Every last
one!''

   Environmentalists want Bob Hope to donate his
7,400 acres of land in the Santa Monica Mountains to a national
preserve, but the 86-year-old entertainer wants to turn a profit.
   Hope, the largest private landholder in the coastal range north
of Los Angeles, has optioned most of the land he acquired in the
1950s to developers who plan golf courses and high-priced homes,
said Payson Wolff, an attorney for Hope.
   ``Mr. Hope regards his properties as investments, and he is
fully entitled to a fair return on them,'' Wolff said Tuesday.
``It's presumptuous for people to say that he should give his land
away. ... If he wants to sell it, more power to him.''
   Supporters of a vast Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area, which includes an ocean-front stretch near Malibu, say
acquiring Hope's land is crucial, because the National Park Service
cannot compete with developers.
   ``Of all the lands you can get in the mountains, Hope has the
critical ones,'' said Joseph T. Edmiston, director of the state-run
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which works with the park
service to acquire land.
   One 339-acre oceanfront tract in Malibu's Corral Canyon is under
option to a company that plans a golf course and resort. Another,
the 1,300-acre Jordan Ranch in the Agoura Hills, has been valued at
$20 million to $30 million.
   The park service has set aside $12 million this year for
acquiring land in the Santa Monica Mountains, and $15 million has
been contributed by the conservancy.

   The state Supreme Court on Wednesday
upheld Johnny Paycheck's seven- to 9{-year sentence in the 1985
shooting of another barroom patron in southern Ohio.
   Authorities said Paycheck, best known for his 1978 hit ``Take
This Job and Shove It,'' pulled out a pistol in the Hillsboro
lounge on Dec. 19, 1985, and fired a shot after interpreting a
remark as an insult, wounding Larry Wise in the scalp. Paycheck was
sent to the Chillicothe Correctional Institute on Feb. 7, 1989,
with no chance of parole for at least five years and eight months.
   The country crooner originally was charged with felonious
assault involving the use of a gun, but a jury convicted him of a
lesser offense of aggravated assault. He also was convicted of
tampering with evidence.
   In an appeal, lawyers for Paycheck argued that he should not
have been given a mandatory three-year sentence for use of a
firearm. They contended the lesser charge did not provide for the
firearm specification.
   The court ruled that a firearm specification in the assault
charge applied to other lesser charges against him. The opinion
said that when a person is charged with a felony, the indictment
``necessarily and simultaneously charges the defendant with the
lesser offenses as well.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has accepted Brown
University's invitation to speak on campus, a State Department
official said Wednesday, but the school is refusing to comment.
   The State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that Gorbachev had agreed in
principle to speak at the Ivy League school, but it was unclear
whether the Soviet president would be available to speak at Brown's
commencement in late May.
   ``The timing of Brown's commencement does not coincide with
plans for the summit,'' said the official.
   Gorbachev and President Bush plan to meet in the United States
in June, but probably not until late in the month.
   School officials have refused any comment since reports of
Gorbachev's possible visit surfaced Tuesday.
   ``We still don't feel we can say anything,'' said Robert
Reichley, when told about the State Department official's comment.
``I can't tell you what the reason is.''
   On Tuesday, a congressional source also said Gorbachev had
agreed to accept an honorary degree from Brown, but no date had
been set.

   The family of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
criticized the British musical ``King,'' saying it trivializes the
legacy of the slain civil rights leader.
   A spokesman for the King family said Tuesday the family ``feels
strongly that there has been no meeting of the minds'' despite
years of discussions with a team of writers, producers and
directors.
   ``The family believes that the musical falls short of the
historical authenticity and that it trivializes Dr. King's
legacy,'' spokesman Kent Matlock of Matlock &amp; Associates Inc. said
in a statement.
   Matlock said the King family would provide no authorization for
the musical or the stage play soundtrack.
   The statement indicated that musical is produced by the London,
England-based production group, Multi Media AG and Hargitay Group
Holdings AG.

<HEAD>Postal Board Chairman Urges Labor Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The requirement that the Postal Service and
its unions go to binding arbitration when they cannot reach
agreement on a contract should be changed, the chairman of the post
office's governing board said Wednesday.
   Leaders of the two biggest unions representing postal workers
immediately rejected the suggestion from Robert Setrakian.
Contracts with the major unions representing postal workerts expire
this year.
   ``I think it's a very, very bad idea,'' said Vincent Sombrotto,
president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. ``Final
and binding arbitration was made part of the postal reorganization
act to balance the inability of postal employees having the right
strike.''
   Moe Biller, head of the American Postal Workers Union,
responded: ``If they want to give us the right to strike, that's
fine. But other than that it's obvious that he either knows nothing
about the collective bargaining process or he doesn't want
collective bargaining.''
   Both Biller and Sombrotto stressed they would rather work out a
contract agreement with postal mamnagement than go to arbitration.
   Several postal board members told the House Post Office
Committee they think changes are needed in the arbitration process,
although not necessarily those proposed by Setrakian.
   Testifying a day after the postal service announced plans for a
rate increase next year, Setrakian said labor accounts for 83
percent of postal spending.
   Setrakian told the committee that when a dispute goes to
arbitration the final result is usually ``to take the baby and cut
it in half.'' Since both sides know arbitration will likely result
in the difference between them being split, they consider that in
their negotiations, said Setrakian.
   Management and labor should be forced to come together, he said,
and the element of uncertainty should be increased. For example, he
suggested the president or a special committee of Congress could be
allowed to settle an impasse.
   Postal Governor Ira Hall suggested another solution might be a
limited arbitration _ in which the arbitrator may only choose the
position of one side or the other, and not to divide their
differences.
   That, said Hall, would force both sides to get as close as
possible before going to arbitration.
   But Sombrotto said, ``It's kind of a cynical approach to say
that all the arbitrators do is to split the difference.'' Both he
and Biller said postal contracts have only gone to arbitration once
in recent decades.
   Setrakian also suggested responsibility for raising rates should
be left to the board of governors, instead of the current system of
sending a plan to the independent Postal Rate Commission which then
can take nearly a year to make a decision. Other board members
attending the meeting did not join him in that idea, however.
   His proposal came a week after several members of the rate
commission told the committee they should have final authority for
setting rates.
   Currently, the governors send a rate plan to the commission. It
considers the matter and sends back its own rate plan.
   If both groups agree, new rates take effect. If not, the
governors can ask the commission to reconsider, accept the
commission plan or overrule it _ but to overule they must vote
unanimously.
   Mustering a unanimous vote is a difficult task most times, and
would be even less likely this year, considering that the governors
voted only 6-4 to submit this year's proposed increase in the first
place.

   The prosecution rested its case today
against Joseph Hazelwood after a defense lawyer tried to poke holes
in an expert's testimony that the skipper was drunk while in
command of the Exxon Valdez.
   Richard Prouty acknowledged his method of calculating backwards
to determine someone's prior level of intoxication is a subject of
dispute among experts. He also said his results would have been
different if he had different facts about Hazelwood's liquor
consumption before he boarded the tanker.
   Prouty said he was told by prosecutors that Hazelwood drank five
shots of 100-proof vodka in a period seven hours before he boarded
the ship on the night it ran aground.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson asked if Prouty's conclusions would
be different if Hazelwood had only two or three drinks of vodka
with a lower potency beginning just four hours before boarding the
ship. Witnesses gave different accounts of Hazelwood's drinking on
that day.
   Prouty said the figures would definitely be different, and would
not reach the 0.14 percent blood alcohol level he concluded
Hazelwood had at the time of the grounding.
   Prouty was the state's 45th and final witness in 4{ weeks of
testimony.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone told jurors they shouldn't
form any opinions before hearing the defense witnesses. ``You
haven't heard it all,'' he said.
   Hazelwood's lawyers contend the defendant wasn't drunk when the
tanker rammed a reef March 24, setting off the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Prouty, chief forensic toxicologist with the Oklahoma medical
examiner's office, said he used a combination of figures to
``calculate backwards'' from blood and urine tests done on
Hazelwood 10{ hours after the grounding.
   He said Hazelwood's blood alcohol level would have been .14
percent at 12:05 a.m. when the tanker ran aground in Prince William
Sound.
   The legal limit in Alaska for driving a car is .10 percent. The
Coast Guard has a limit of .04 for operating a commercial vessel,
but jurors weren't told of the regulation because Hazelwood is
charged under state law, not federal.
   Evidence on whether Hazelwood was drunk has been inconclusive,
but the issue remains a key factor in the prosecution's effort to
prove he was reckless.
   Crew members have testified that except for alcohol on his
breath, their captain showed no signs of being drunk when he
boarded the ship in Valdez four hours before the grounding. And
they said he was calm and in control of the ship after the disaster.
   But Prouty said he has seen cases of men with a blood alcohol
level of .20 who showed no signs of being drunk.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole asked whether Prouty
would consider a person with a level of .14 to be impaired in
reasoning and decision-making.
   ``It is my opinion they definitely would be impaired,'' Prouty
said.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with criminal
mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. He could get up to 7\
years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude into Prince William Sound, killing countless birds, fish and
other wildlife and polluting hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline
with black goo.
   In 4{ weeks of testimony, prosecutors have sought to show that
Hazelwood was reckless in leaving a third mate in charge of the
bridge during the ship's passage into the sound. They maintained
also that he recklessly tried to run the ship off jagged Bligh Reef
after the grounding.
   Underlying the recklessness charge is the claim of intoxication.
   When Hazelwood was tested at about 10:30 a.m on March 24, his
blood alcohol reading was .061. Prouty said he ``calculated
backwards in time,'' considering Hazelwood's height, weight and an
estimate that he stopped drinking at 8 p.m.
   The toxicologist said accurate and specific information is
critical in attempting such a calculation.
   ``It's desirable to know the individual's body size and weight,
what the person was drinking, when he started, what type of
beverage he consumed, and when he stopped,'' Prouty said. He
indicated he also usually figures in what a person had to eat.
   There are conflicts among witnesses over how much Hazelwood
drank, when he drank it and when he stopped. In addition, there has
been testimony suggesting the skipper drank a low-alcohol beer
after the grounding.
   Hazelwood's history of drunken driving convictions and his
participation in an alcohol rehabilitation program are inadmissible
and jurors will not be told about them.

   Life in Cooper is just the way its
residents like it. They know each other by name, and people smile
when they speak to strangers. At Miller's corner drugstore, high
school football dominates the conversation and the milkshakes are
homemade.
   But one constant, dependable part of that life has abruptly come
unglued. Greyhound is on strike and Cooper is one of 9,000
communities where the company's buses provide the only intercity
transportation.
   ``I've only sold one ticket since the strike started, and that
person knew about the strike and wound up hitching a ride to
Dallas,'' said Marion Miller, who runs the family drugstore with
his father, Manton.
   ``Actually it's a good thing he didn't wait around because the
bus was an hour and a half late,'' said the younger Miller, whose
store doubles as the bus station in this town of 2,315 people 80
miles northeast of Dallas.
   Greyhound Lines Inc., America's only nationwide bus system, has
been limping along since its 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office
and maintenance workers went on strike. The union, which walked out
Friday over wage and job security issues, has asked for new talks
but none are scheduled.
   The company has been operating a reduced schedule during the
6-day-old strike, using about 700 replacement drivers plus union
members who cross picket lines. Greyhound said Wednesday its
ridership Tuesday was 37.1 percent of the same day last year, an
increase from Monday' 33.8 percent and Friday's 30 percent.
   But bus travel in small towns such as Cooper has slowed to a
virtual crawl.
   ``In a small town, it's more of a sporadic stream of business,''
the younger Miller said. ``I might have five or six people in a day
trying to catch a bus, but then on other days I might not have
any.''
   Manton Miller said he normally sells about 10 tickets a week _
Greyhound pays him $75 a week to serve as agent _ but some of his
regular customers are business people who regularly use the bus to
ship and receive supplies ranging from auto parts to bull semen.
   ``It would be kind of hard for farmers and breeders to schedule
the semen shipments for their artificial breeding. That stuff has
to be refrigerated and I don't think it can stand to be left around
for more than two or three days,'' he said.
   Before the strike, four buses passed through Cooper daily on the
route between Texarkana and Dallas. But this week, Manton Miller
said, no buses stopped by his store.
   He said the limited bus service resulting from the strike
reminds him of a time about two years ago when a woman told him
that it took a rookie bus driver more than 90 minutes to make the
20-mile trip from the town of Paris.
   ``That's the kind of problems they have when they're training
these new drivers,'' he said. ``When you've got to fill in your
schedule with all new people, you're just asking for problems.''
   Since Delta County has evolved from an economy driven by
agriculture to one struggling to fuel itself by light industry, a
prolonged strike could cripple local businesses that depend on
Greyhound's freight service.
   ``Well, it's going to hurt us,'' said Bonnie Oats, who runs a
clothing manufacturing plant with her husband, Zane.
   Mrs. Oats said they often receive up to three supply shipments a
week. And the convenience provided by the bus schedules is
invaluable, she said.
   ``We can depend on the bus. You don't ever know when UPS is
going to get here,'' she said.

   Text of the statement released Wednesday
by the Revolutionary Justice Organization as translated by The
Associated Press bureau in Beirut:
   In the name of the powerful Almighty,
   After a comprehensive study of audio and printed statements and
reactions about the hostages' question and some issues and
developments in the region, the Revolutionary Justice Organization
announces the following:
   First _ During the prolonged American darkness that has engulfed
the region, all have fallen into U.S. traps. Intentions are
obscured, guns have been deviated and rules of classifying friends
and foes by members of the same ranks have changed. Painful stabs
have been dealt to our essential causes. Strugglers and martyrs
have fallen in the arenas of shame everywhere with America behind
them, above them and in between them, not to say inside of them all.
   In this deluge, and in spite of all, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization remains, and remains, and remains holding to its
positions and directing all its efforts and strugglers against
America and its allies, only America and its allies. The
organization counsels all that this is the right and sole course to
which suicide strugglers and special operations should be directed.
They should wake up and ponder what they do.
   In this atmosphere, the United States has raised the question of
the hostages from a humanitarian angle. But by monitoring American
moves here and there and through planting elements in regional
American stations, and after trailing some spies, we have acquired
accurate information that an American military operation is
imminent against areas where the Americans believe hostages are
held. We call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware
and be on the alert against what America is hatching.
   We are sorry over some irresponsible declarations by local
friends in this regard that may have resulted from failing to
understand the nature of the American movements. And we call upon
them to concentrate their humanitarian attempts on areas that can
be more positive and more productive.
   Second _ The Revolutionary Justice Organization holds spies and
humanitarianism requires just punishment, not a reward. We warn
America away from what it calls the hard option because we are are
on alert. We are today stronger and better prepared and more
determined to hit out at strategic interests and deal painful
blows. Washington realizes more than anyone else that our strength
today is not that of yesterday.
   Third _ We tenaciously hold to keeping America's nose in the mud
under our feet. There is no intention to release hostages. No one
should ask for resolving the hostage issue except within the
balanced and positive framework for which we have often proposed
several adequate outlets, on many occasions, that will guarantee
the rights of all.
   Victory for the oppressed in the march toward liberation and
justice,
   Glory and immortality for the revered martyrs,
   The Revoltuionary Justice Organization.

   Bank profits tumbled 34 percent in 1989, held
back in the last half of the year by mounting real estate woes in
the Northeast and debt troubles in the Third World.
   The nation's commercial banks earned $16.3 billion, down from a
record $24.8 billion in 1988, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
said Wednesday.
   The contrast between the first six months of the year and the
last half was dramatic. In the January-June period, banks posted
$14.3 billion in earnings, the best ever for six months, compared
with a weak $2 billion in the final half.
   Fourth quarter earnings were held to $2.7 billion after the
industry set aside $8.4 billion to cover losses on domestic loans.
Most of the problems centered on real estate development lending,
but the percentage of sour consumer loans edged up for the fifth
consecutive year to 1.6 percent.
   In the third quarter, big banks set aside $7.6 billion to cover
Third World debt losses, producing a rare loss for the industry of
$740 million. It was the worst showing since the second quarter of
1987, when a previous round of reserving for developing country
loans caused a $10.6 billion loss.
   Banks in the oil-producing Southwest continued to recover slowly
from the oil and real estate busts earlier in the mid-1980s, but
northeastern banks deteriorated sharply. Western and Midwest banks
showed strong gains and southeastern institutions held steady.
   Bad real estate loans more than doubled in the Northeast, where
four states were among the 10 with the highest percentage of sour
real estate loans.
   The Boston-based Bank of New England alone lost $1.1 billion
last year, most of it in real estate.
   Despite the problems, banks continued to pour money into real
estate lending, particularly in the Southeast and West. Real estate
lending increased 12.8 percent nationally, compared with a 5.4
percent growth rate for bank assets generally.
   Five of the country's 10 largest banks were in the red last
year, primarily because of provisions for losses on developing
country loans. They were Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty,
Manufacturers Hanover, Bankers Trust and Chemical Bank.
   The chairman of the FDIC, L. William Seidman, predicted that the
industry's performance would improve this year, at least in the
first six months. Private analysts were less optimistic.
   ``We are in a particularly vicious real estate cycle,'' said
economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates of
Philadelphia. ``I think you're going to get more bad news ...
particularly in the Southeast in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas
because there was a lot of speculative buying there.''
   Seidman, however, said, ``All is not on the black side. There
was some good news. Particularly (small) community banks showed
improving earnings. ... Much of the (Third World loan problems)
would appear to be behind most of the large banks.''
   In another positive sign, the list of ``problem'' banks, which
the FDIC uses to predict bank failures, stood at 1,093 at the end
of 1989, down from 1,394 a year earlier and 1,559 at the end of
1987.
   Seidman forecast fewer bank failures in 1990 compared with last
year, when 206 banks failed or required government assistance to
stay open.
   The failures and a spate of mergers reduced the number of banks
to 12,706 at the end of 1989, compared with a peak of 14,496 five
years earlier.

   The Bush administration on Wednesday welcomed
``more hopeful'' statements from Iran about the American hostages
in Lebanon while members of Congress pressed for a special envoy to
deal with the situation.
   In Beirut, meanwhile, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, a
group claiming to hold two American hostages, said it had no
intention of releasing them.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said administration
officials were ``encouraged by the comments'' of Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani who said there might be a solution soon.
   ``They certainly are more hopeful than what we've heard in the
more distant past,'' he said of Rafsanjani's remarks.
   Rafsanjani was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying: `My feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving
towards a solution.''
   But he also said Western nations must help trace Iranian
hostages missing in Lebanon and ``also reduce their mischievous
acts.''
   Revolutionary Justice, the group that claims to hold Joseph
Cicippio of Valley Forge, Pa., and Edward Austin Tracy, an American
author, said ``there is no intention to release hostages.'' The
statement, delivered to Beirut newspaper An-Nahar and a Western
news agency, was accompanied by a black-and-white instant
photograph of Cicippio.
   U.S. officials made clear they did not see Rafsanjani's
statements as portending any immediate release of eight missing
Americans, most if not all of whom are thought to be held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in Lebanon. All told, there are 18
Western hostages.
   But officials described the comments as positive. Fitzwater
called them ``in line with statements that we have seen in recent
days and weeks that there was some interest in Iran in better
relations with the West.''
   ``We hope that that's the case and that it will result in
release of the hostages,'' he said at a briefing before reports of
the Revolutionary Justice communique.
   Fitzwater said the United States did not have ``direct knowledge
of Mr. Rafsanjani's motives or purposes in making those remarks.''
   But a State Department official familiar with the hostage issue
said he believed the Iranians ``won't be able to get the economic
aid and credit'' they seek from the West so long as hostages remain
in Lebanon.
   ``I think they realize there is no longer any benefit to holding
the hostages,'' he said, speaking on condition he remain anonymous.
   Amid the flurry of reports about the hostages, a House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee referred to the full panel a proposed ``sense
of Congress'' resolution that the president ``should designate a
special envoy to negotiate the release of American hostages in
Lebanon.''
   The measure was introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who
said she also hoped to draw attention to the March 16 date marking
the fifth year of captivity for Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   ``We cannot replace those lost years, but we owe it to Terry, to
his little girl, and to the seven other American hostages to secure
their release,'' she said.
   Anderson, the longest-held American hostage, has a daughter born
3 months after he was seized.
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., has proposed a companion Senate
resolution. A concurrent resolution does not go to the president
for his signature so it does not have the force of law, but it puts
Congress on record.
   U.S. officials usually oppose the idea of special envoys, a
State Department official said. ``Remember Terry Waite _ he was a
special envoy,'' the official said, referring to the Anglican
churchman who was seized in Beirut while trying to free the
hostages.
   ``We have mechanisms for talking with the Iranians and we aren't
sure there is anything to gain from talking directly to the
hostage-holders,'' the official said.
   Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``We've been talking for a long time to anyone who could have
influence, Algerians, Syrians. We talk to the Iranians through a
lot of people. We have talked to enough people that the message has
gotten through to the Iranians.''
   The message, said the official, who demanded anonymity, is: ``We
know you want access to the West. You've said you are against
terrorism. We want to see action.''
   The official U.S. policy is not to deal directly with the
Iranians. ``There are no U.S. government talks,'' spokeswoman
Margaret D. Tutwiler said.
   Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over Hezbollah,
the umbrella group for the radical Shiite Moslems.

<HEAD>Spreadsheet Designer Cautions Against Copyright Protections for
Ideas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   One of the nation's most successful computer
software designers cautioned Congress Wednesday against passing
laws that would overprotect ``intellectual property'' by extending
copyright protection to ideas.
   ``It's the nature of software for ideas to slosh and flow back
and forth between competitors, companies and industries,'' Mitchell
D. Kapor told a House subcommittee. ``If, as a software designer, I
can use a program and learn from it without copying its internals,
then I should be free to use the knowledge that I've gained as long
as I expressed the ideas in my own way.''
   The subcomittee is considering a revision of laws governing
intellectual property _ a phrase covering copyrights, patents and
trade secrets _ and heard from Kapor, software designer Daniel S.
Bricklin and government officials concerned with copyrights and
patents. Software refers to sets of instructions for computers,
whether the instructions are stored on punched cards, magnetic
tape, disks or chips.
   Kapor designed a spreadsheet known as Lotus 1-2-3, which became
a standard of the computer industry and made Lotus Development
Corp, which he founded, one of the most successful software firms
in the country. The firm is involved in a copyright suit against
two competitors.
   ``There is no question, as I look at my industry, that there has
been an unsteady but stubborn march to extend the scope of
copyright,'' Kapor said. ``Twisting and straining each step of the
way to secure additional copyright protections, too many companies
seem to have decided that it's easier to sue their rivals than
compete with them.
   ``Litigation is becoming a business tactic, not a practice of
last resort. Software should not be an industry driven by
litigation,'' said Kapor, adding that he was not complaining about
the lawsuit.
   Kapor said he sees no way to prevent potential competitors from
profitiing from his company's efforts.
   ``If they can replicate our efforts or go them one better
because our approach inspired them to do so, more power to them,''
he said. ``I would only call my lawyer if we found that these
competitors had not just copied the idea, but the actual lines of
code underlying it.''
   James W. Curlin of the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment presented the committee with an OTA study that said the
United States' 70 percent share of the world's computer software
market could shrink without better legal protection.
   With continued innovation, the United States can keep outshining
its foreign competitors, the study said, claiming that intellectual
property protection encourages innovation by providing incentives
for creation and security for investors.
   Last year, software and related services were a $60 billion
industry in the United States.

   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
compared House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt to television's
bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart on Wednesday and said, ``It's
hard to figure out what he's up to.''
   Fitzwater took issue with the Missouri Democrat's stinging
rebuke of Bush and his proposal for direct economic aid to the
Soviet Union.
   ``He's hard to believe,'' Fitzwater said at his daily White
House news briefing. ``He's the Maxwell Smart of politics. Do you
believe he wants to raise taxes on the American people to give
money to the Soviet Union?''
   The president's spokesman did not elaborate on his reference to
the well-intentioned but self-important and clumsy hero of the
1960s ``Get Smart'' comedy series.
   Gephardt spokeswoman Deborah Johns said the majority leader did
not wish to respond to Fitzwater's characterization.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, testifying Wednesday on
Capitol Hill, said there is no need or direct financial aid to
Moscow and ``they haven't asked for it.''
   ``We ought to support the reform efforts in the Soviet Union,''
Baker said. Asked whether communism has ceased to be a threat, he
added, ``We ought not to gloat too much over our success ... It is
not overly-productive to stick a stick in their eye, just for the
hell of it.''
   Gephardt on Tuesday accused Bush of presiding over a government
``of the polls, by the polls and for the polls.''
   ``The Bush foreign policy is a policy adrift, without vision,
without imagination, without a guiding light save precious public
opinion polls,'' Gephardt said in speech to the Center for National
Policy, a liberal research organization.
   Gephardt also proposed direct aid to the Soviet Union and
accused Bush of a ``lack of vision'' for not doing more to
encourage and embrace changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   The 1988 Democratic presidential contender proposed food aid to
the Soviets along with other forms of assistance and a lifting of
trade restrictions.
   ``Well, I don't know, that Gephardt. It's hard to figure out
what he's up to,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I mean, the Soviet Union has indicated that they don't want
direct support. They have not made economic reforms that would be
able to use that kind of support,'' he added.
   Fitzwater noted Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and other Democrats
had opposed the Gephardt proposal as ``pouring money down a
rathole.''

   It cost the government $185,000 to tell people
they bought Social Security information they could've gotten for
free and didn't get the right material at that.
   The General Accounting Office on Wednesday issued a report on
the Social Security Protection Bureau, a private company that has
come under criticism for offering benefits considered by many to be
of dubious value.
   The $7 fee for membership in the bureau brings help in getting
earnings information from the government's Social Security
Administration, information that is available for free directly
from SSA, the GAO said.
   The report said the bureau appears to operate ``without
violating federal legal requirements'' _ but not without cost to
the government.
   The Social Security Administration has processed more than
350,000 requests for earnings and benefit information generated by
the private company, the GAO said.
   It cost the government $900,000 to process those requests,
including $185,000 in ``extraordinary expenses'' because the
company had given people outdated government forms for requesting
the earnings information.
   The $185,000 was spent to send people letters ``explaining that
they had spent $7 for what they could have received free and asking
them to submit the new revised request form,'' the GAO said.
   ``At the same time, the Social Security Protection Bureau could
have received $2 million in membership fees from those 350,000 new
members.''
   The Social Security Protection Bureau is the trade name for
Foxhall Corp., which is controlled by Watson &amp; Hughey Co., a
partnership that has grown into a multimillion-dollar business
promoting non-profit groups.
   Watson &amp; Hughey has been criticized because the partnership _
not the charitable organizations _ gets most of the money obtained
from the public, the GAO said. Thirteen states have taken action
against Watson &amp; Hughey because of possible violations related to
non-profit organizations and consumer protection.
   Attorney Michael Kushnick, who represents Watson &amp; Hughey, said
he had not seen the GAO report but stressed the bureau's operations
``did not violate the law.
   Kushnick said if the information requests cost the government
money, ``I think the benefits to the consumer in getting this
information probably outweighed those costs.''

<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian underground group holding
two American hostages in Lebanon said Wednesday it does not intend
to release the captives, and it urged attacks on U.S. targets.
   The group also accused the United States of planning a military
operation to free the 18 Western captives.
   The statement was released by the Revolutionary Justice
Organization just hours after Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
said he wants the issue of Westerners held in Lebanon resolved. It
followed a flurry of news reports that had raised hopes some
hostages might be released.
   ``We tenaciously cling to keeping America's nose in the mud
under our feet. There is no intention to release hostages,''
Revolutionary Justice said in an Arabic-language statement
delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar and a
Western news agency.
   The handwritten statement was accompanied by a black-and-white
photograph of hostage Joseph Cicippio of Valley Forge, Pa.
Cicippio, acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut,
was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986 in Lebanon.
   The group said ``suicide strugglers and special operations
should be directed'' against the United States and its allies,
adding this was ``the right and sole course.''
   In the picture, Cicippio, dressed in a striped sweater over a
T-shirt, looked straight into the camera. He was without his
eyeglasses and had a bushy, grayish beard. His hair was disheveled.
   The statement was the first from Revolutionary Justice since
Aug. 3, when the group announced it had reversed a decision to kill
Cicippio, 59. The execution had been threatened to retaliate for
Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric from southern Lebanon.
   ``By monitoring American moves here and there and through
planting elements in regional American stations, and after trailing
some spies, we have acquired accurate information that an American
military operation is imminent against areas where the Americans
believe hostages are held,'' the statement said.
   ``We call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware
and be on the alert against what America is hatching,'' the
communique added.
   In an apparent reference to recent comments made by Lebanon's
leading Shiite cleric, the communique said: ``The Revolutionary
Justice Organization holds spies, and humanitarianism requires just
punishment, not a reward.''
   On Feb. 23, the clergyman, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said a ``realistic and humanitarian means'' must be found to free
the hostages.
   The statement was one of several recent developments that had
raised hopes a solution may be in the works.
   Editorials in English-language Iranian newspapers have said the
hostages should be freed because they are being used as
anti-Islamic propaganda. Syrian and other officials also have
expressed optimisim the captives may be freed.
   Rafsanjani, in his most direct statement so far that he wants
the hostages freed, said Wednesday: ``I and my friends would like
the issue to be settled since the United States and others are
exploiting the matter as a means for branding the Lebanese as
terrorists and so they are not seriously seeking a solution.''
   Rafsanjani said Iran was not directly linked to the hostage
issue, but that he had pledged to use Iran's influence to seek
their freedom.
   ``My feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving toward
a solution,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush administration
officials were encouraged by Rafsanjani's comments. ``They
certainly are more hopeful that what we've heard in the more
distant past,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rafsanjani is believed to be eager to obtain the captives'
release because he wants to improve ties with the West. But
radicals opposed to him see confrontation with the West as the
wellspring of the Islamic revolution and are believed to hold
greater sway over the hostage-holders.
   Revolutionary Justice also holds American writer Edward Austin
Tracy, 58, of Burlington, Vt., who was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986.
There are six other Americans held hostage, including Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985, has been held longer than any
hostage.
   The other hostages are four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss, an Irishman, and an Italian.
   ``We warn America away from what it calls the hard option
because we are on alert,'' Revolutionary Justice said. ``We are
today stronger and better prepared and more determined to hit out
at strategic interests and deal painful blows.''
   There was no immediate comment from the White House on the
latest development.
   Earlier, the Bush administration said it was encouraged by
Rafsanjani's comments. ``They certainly are more hopeful than what
we've heard in the more distant past,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Members of a House panel were taking up a proposed ``sense of
Congress'' resolution that the president ``should designate a
special envoy to negotiate the release of American hostages in
Lebanon.''
   The measure was introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who
said she also hoped to draw attention to the March 16 date marking
the fifth year of captivity for Anderson.

<TEXT>
   At least 134 people were missing Wednesday
after a boat carrying children returning from holiday collided with
a freighter and sank into the Amazon River, police said.
   The riverboat Andresito sank Tuesday evening near the Amazon
port of Iquitos, 715 miles northeast of Lima, police said. The boat
had just left Iquitos for Puritoyacu, a jungle village three days'
journey away.
   Police said the Andresito was carrying 209 crew members and
passengers who were mostly children. Some parents and teachers also
were aboard.
   The boat also was loaded with lumber to be used for a new school
in Puritoyacu. Police said the heavy cargo may have contributed to
the accident.
   The boat's helmsman told police that the Andresito's motor
failed and the boat began drifting out of control in the Amazon's
fast currents.
   In the darkness it smacked into several small boats anchored
along the shore and then careened into a large freighter, rolled
over and sank into the river's dark waters, police said.
   Police said Wednesday that 74 people had been rescued and the
body of a girl had been recovered.
   They said the freighter's crew rescued five of the passengers by
throwing life preservers into the water, but others were quickly
swept away by the current.
   They said heavy rain was hampering rescue boats and divers.
   The 182-foot Andresito had a 40-ton capacity, according to dock
authorities in Iquitos. The freighter, an ocean-going ship 420 feet
long and with a capacity of 7,500 tons, received only a minor dent
in its side, police said.
   The freighter was identified by its owner, Naviera Amazonica
Peruana, as the Yacu Caspi, which travels the Amazon to the
Atlantic and to Caribbean ports.
   It was tied up at a dock at Punchana, 6 miles from Iquitos, when
the Andresito smashed into its side.
   Alfredo Bringas, the company's manager, said the Yacu Caspi
arrived last week from Miami with sugar and wheat flour for Iquitos
and steel pipes for Occidental Petroleum Corp., which produces oil
in jungle fields in the Iquitos area.

<TEXT>
   Requiring all job seekers to show an identity
card would greatly help enforcement of laws barring the employment
of illegal aliens, the nation's chief immigration official said
Wednesday.
   Gene McNary, who heads the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, told reporters he was not proposing a nationwide identitiy
card, but would consider the concept if it were advanced by others.
   ``I believe it would greatly enhance our ability to enforce
employer sanctions'' that prohibit businesses from hiring illegal
aliens, McNary said.
   ``I'm not taking the initiative; it's something that should be
reviewed and discussed,'' McNary said. ``I think its up to some
others; it's going to take a law'' passed by Congress.
   Before endorsing the concept, ``I'd like to have the benefit of
discussion; I'd like to get the viewpoint of some of the interest
groups,'' he said.
   An identity card would also eliminate the use of fake documents
by illegal aliens to forge false identities, the INS chief said.
   Under the concept, an identity care would be issued to all
adults seeking work, both citizens and aliens with permission from
INS to hold jobs in this country.
   Those issued the card would have to show it only to prospective
employers.
   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, employers can
be fined or prosecuted for employing illegal aliens. The provision
has resulted in complaints that employers have discriminated
against people they feared were illegal aliens.
   Studies in California and New York recently blamed the 1986
law's employer sanctions for discrimination against Hispanics and
members of other ethnic groups who were wrongly suspected of being
illegal aliens.
   The law also bars such discrimination and a Justice Department
unit set up in 1987 to handle such cases has received more than 800
complaints from citizens.
   McNary said he believed the congressional General Accounting
Office would discuss the feasibility of issuing a uniform identity
card in a report it is preparing on the immigration service.
   McNary said he did not know whether the GAO would endorse the
concept, which has been discussed by a growing number of lawmakers
as a way to tighten immigration laws.
   Many of the discrimination complaints against employers arise
from confusion about what types of documentation should be required
for job seekers, said Andrew Strojny, the Justice Department's
acting special counsel for immigation-related unfair employment
practices.
   ``Many of the complaints deal with employers not understanding
what documents are acceptable'' as proof that a person is a citizen
or has INS permission to get a job, he said
   Strojny said that a nationwide identity card would result in
less discrimination but that, personally, he feared it would lead
to a system under which the government would be granting citizens
permission to work.

<TEXT>
   President Bush prodded electronics-industry
officials Wednesday to ``do better'' against foreign trade rivals
in marketing U.S.-developed products such as videocassette
recorders.
   ``So many of the world's advanced technologies, from robotics to
the VCR, were first developed here. And yet, so many of these
concepts were ultimately brought to the marketplace by our
competitors,'' Bush said in a speech to the American Electronics
Association.
   Bush said he was asking the White House Council on
Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, to ``find
ways that American industry can better translate new ideas and
technologies into marketable products.''
   He said he would try ``to level the playing field'' by strictly
enforcing trade laws and pressing other nations to open their
markets more fully.
   But, he told his audience, ``It will be leaders like you right
here in this room that have to take the ball and run with it.
   ``We can do better. And I am determined we will do better.''
   Bush proposed no new trade strategies, but said congressional
enactment of many of his lanquishing initiatives would help make
U.S. high-tech goods more competitive.
   Without passage of his proposed reduction in the capital-gains
tax rate, ``every business in America _ of every size _ is at a
competitive disadvantage abroad,'' Bush said.
   Among the nation's major trade competitors, Bush said, Japan has
a 5 percent capital gains tax and South Korea, Taiwan and West
Germany have none.
   Capital gains are the income from the sale of stocks, real
estate and other assets. It is taxed at the same rate as other
income _ up to 33 percent. Bush's proposal would lower the rate, in
effect, to about 19.5 percent.
   Bush promised Wednesday to work toward helping the U.S.
electronics industry ``regain and retain'' its lost leadership in
world markets, saying he was optimistic that his meeting last
weekend with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu would help pry
open more markets in Japan.
   He said he and Kaifu ``specifically discussed satellites and
telecommunications, supercomputers, forest products and ...
semiconductors. I hope, on the basis of our talks, that Japan will
be moving toward early resolution of these problem areas.''
   There has been a longstanding trade dispute between the United
States and Japan over semiconductors, or computer chips, that
resulted in temporary sanctions against Japan in 1987 for
deliberately selling chips in U.S. markets at below-market prices.

<TEXT>
   Nine Western European nations
agreed Wednesday on a plan to clean up the North Sea, one of the
world's most polluted salt water bodies.
   The nations agreed to reduce by 70 percent their emissions of
mercury, lead, cadmium and dioxin, which they described as among
the most dangerous materials polluting the sea.
   The reductions are to be achieved by the end of 1995, said Dutch
Transport Minister Hanja Maij-Weggen, chairman of a conference on
cleaning up the North Sea.
   Levels of 37 other toxic materials would be cut in half by the
same date and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, would be phased
out by 1999, he said.
   The 228,000-square-mile North Sea is surrounded by Western
Europe's most heavily industrialized nations.
   Pollution from smokestack emissions, sea dumping and rivers used
as industrial sewers have threatened fish and seal populations with
toxic chemicals.
   Each year, industrial emissions cause some 45 tons of mercury,
3,500 tons of lead and 95 tons of cadmium to accumulate into the
North Sea. A figure for dioxins was not immediately available.
   Agreement to limit the materials was a breakthrough for the
conference. As the meeting got underway, several nations criticized
Britain, which environmental activists here called ``the dirty man
of Europe.''
   But Maij-Weggen said that during discussions Wednesday, Britain
had been ``very constructive. ... I think that the criticism
against it has helped a little bit.''
   In a letter to British Environment Secretary Chris Patten,
Norway, Sweden and Denmark had expressed dissatisfaction with
London's announcement this week that it planned to phase out
industrial waste dumping by late 1992 or early 1993.
   ``We are of the opinion that this should take place without
further delay,'' the said the letter, a copy of which was obtained
by The Associated Press.
   Participating nations at a conference in 1987 in London pledged
to halt all industrial waste dumping by Jan. 1, 1990, and all North
Sea countries except for Britain have met the deadline.
   The conference is the third in a series that began in the West
German port city of Bremen in 1984.
   The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, Belgium,
France, Britain and Switzerland, as well as the European
Commission, the EEC's executive body, are participating. Ten other
European nations, including East Germany and Czechoslovakia, have
observer status.
   Britain announced this week it would end dumping industrial
waste in two or three years' time. Meantime, it would allow annual
dumpings of 205,000-270,000 tons.
   Before the conference, Dutch Transport Minister Hanja
Maij-Weggen said the British announcement on waste dumping was
``too little and too late.''
   Patten said ``land-based means of disposal have not yet been
established'' for the types of waste that will be dumped in the
North Sea in the coming years.
   But critics said the British business world, burdened by aging
industries, is balking at the cost of converting to land-based
waste treatment.
   Another contentious subject at the conference was marine
pollution by PCBs, believed to be among the most hazardous
substances manufactured.
   Annually, 39 tons of PCBs find their way into the North Sea,
where they are a serious threat to the reproductive cycle of seals.
Seal populations in the area are rapidly dwindling.
   Patten said that contrary to the opinion of the other states,
``it is essential to link phase-out with destruction.'' He said
long-term storage of PCBs is ``environmentally unacceptable.''
   West Germany is strongly pushing for a total ban on the use of
PCBs by 1995. Under that proposal, PCBs now in use _ for instance
as coolants in heavy-duty electrical equipment _ should be stored
until environmentally safe technology has been develop to destroy
them.

   Frank Wynn said he hopes his telephone
stops ringing with calls from people looking for an iguana.
   Wynn took nearly 40 phone calls in two days about an iguana he
found on his patio Feb. 24, and was quite relieved to surrender it
Monday night to a woman who convinced him she was the real owner.
   The Morning Advocate newspaper ran an article Monday about
Wynn's discovery, loosing a flood of calls from lost-iguana seekers.
   ``The amazing thing to me is there's so many iguanas loose all
over the city,'' Wynn said.

   An 11-year-old girl said it felt good to return
$200,000 in lost jewelry to a vacationing Michigan couple who
hadn't even noticed their loss.
   Jennifer Hawkins of West Palm Beach, Fla., was jogging Friday
with her father, Darrell Hawkins, when she spotted a tapestry bag
in a gutter outside a Palm Beach hotel.
   She took it to the police. They said it contained $2,600 in
cash, gold and pearl earrings, gold necklaces and pendants, pearl,
emerald, ruby and diamond studs, a gold leaf pin, a 28-inch strand
of pearls and a diamond pendant.
   ``It was very exciting, actually, to be involved in finding
something,'' Jennifer said Tuesday. ``It especially felt good to
return it to the lady.
   Police found a matchbook from the Heart of Palm Beach Hotel in
the bag, enabling them to trace the owners, Betty and Montgomery
Shepard. The couple gave Miss Hawkins a $100 reward.
   ``She didn't even realize the purse was missing,'' West Palm
Beach Police Officer Craig E. Gunkel said.

<HEAD>Report Says Strategic Arms Treaty Could Save Up to $12 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Soviet treaty to reduce strategic
weapons would produce annual federal savings ranging from $3
billion to $12 billion depending on President Bush's plans to
modernize strategic forces, said a congressional study released
Wednesday.
   The Congressional Budget Office projected long-term savings
based on the likelihood that an agreement to limit nuclear warheads
to 6,000 on each side will emerge later this year from superpower
negotiations in Geneva.
   The treaty would not limit the production of new weapons
systems, and the CBO estimated the savings based on three options _
the Bush administration continuing full-scale modernization of its
strategic forces, a less expensive plan to upgrade the systems and
minimum steps to improve the arsenal.
   If the United States signs a treaty and continues current plans
to buy 132 B-2 stealth bombers, 500 single-warhead Midgetman
missiles, 23 Trident submarines and move 50 multiple-warhead MX
missiles to railroad cars, savings would be about $3 billion.
   Retirement of B-52 bombers, Minutemen land-based missiles and
Poseidon submarines would have to accompany these actions, the CBO
said.
   ``Virtually all of the savings under this option would come from
reduced operating costs associated with smaller strategic forces,''
the CBO said. ``Because of the aggressive program of modernization
assumed under this approach, average savings for procurement would
be modest.''
   However, if the United States adopts a plan calling for
rail-garrison MX missiles, 250 Midgetman missiles, 20 Trident
submarines and 66 B-2 stealth bombers, savings would total about $8
billion a year.
   A drastic plan to buy no more than the 17 Trident submarines and
15 B-2 bombers under contract, and no rail-garrison MX and
Midgetman missiles, would mean savings of about $12 billion a year.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., who requested the study, said the
report indicates the ``big savings in defense are not going to come
out of this part (strategic forces) of the budget,''
   The Republican senator also stressed the importance of
continuing modernization.
   ``I don't think it is prudent to abandon our modernization
efforts at this time and I don't think it would be prudent to do so
after the conclusion of the START treaty,'' he said.

   Masked Palestinians marched through the West
Bank's largest market Wednesday to protest the easing of an Arab
commercial strike that was announced in a new leaflet from the
uprising leadership.
   Arab reports said a suspected collaborator was found hanged near
his village in the occupied Gaza Strip, and the army said it
demolished the West Bank home of a suspected uprising activist.
   Soldiers also shot and wounded four Palestinians in scattered
stone-throwing clashes throughout the West Bank, Arab hospital
officials said. The army said it was checking the reports.
   The march in the Nablus casbah by men from PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction represented a rare show of defiance against
the uprising leadership, which has directed the nearly 27-month-old
revolt through clandestinely produced leaflets.
   A leaflet released Tuesday said shopkeepers could open their
stores from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. starting Saturday. Shopkeepers have
been closing their stores since January 1988 at noon in observance
of a previously ordered strike.
   The limited hours, which were widely observed, were part of a
display of strength by the uprising's underground leadership.
   Israeli authorities had first ordered striking shopkeepers to
open their stores, but later gave up when the efforts proved futile.
   The marchers shouted through loudspeakers that Nablus will be
excluded from the decision on store hours and that violators would
be punished.
   It was unclear how merchants in Nablus, the West Bank's largest
town with 120,000 people, would respond.
   Although some merchants in Arab east Jerusalem welcomed the
longer hours as a way to revive depressed businesses, others were
upset with the new directive.
   ``It sends the wrong message to Israel,'' said one east
Jerusalem shopkeeper who insisted on anonymity. ``It suggests there
is no uprising anymore.''
   There have been other indications the revolt has been losing
steam.
   Last month, nine Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire,
the lowest monthly casualty toll since the uprising began in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987.
   At least 659 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the revolt. Another 193 Palestinians have been
slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died.
   On Wednesday, Arab reports said the body of Fahmi Zaanin, 23,
was found hanging from a tree a night earlier near the Gaza village
of Beit Hanoun. He had been kidnapped from his home Saturday by
masked Palestinians, they said.
   ``The fate of Zaanin is the fate of all collaborators,'' said
wall slogans signed by the Red Eagles, a group believed affiliated
with the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Also Wednesday, soldiers blew up the home of Mohammed Karoush,
45, of the West Bank village of Deir Balout. Arab reports said that
14 people lived in the house.
   The army said it took the action against Karoush's 25-year-old
son, Maher, who has been wanted since July on charges of throwing
firebombs at Israeli cars, damaging property on Jewish settlements
and attacking soldiers and suspected collaborators.

<TEXT>
   Angry demonstrators have torn down a
statue of the nation's first Communist premier, exactly 45 years
after he took power.
   The statue was felled Tuesday night after hundreds of
demonstrators gathered in front of the monument to Petru Groza and,
without waiting for an official decision, took a crane from a
nearby construction site and ripped the statue down.
   ``Thus a more than symbolic act of justice which closed a
nefarious chapter in our national history was closed, a chapter
based on lies and political pressure,'' the daily Romania Libera
said.
   The demolition took place a day after work crews lifted the
statue of Vladimir I. Lenin from its foundation after two days of
intensive work.
   The demonstration began earlier Tuesday when 300 people gathered
in front of the institute of Medicine to demand the removal of the
statue of Groza.
   Demonstrators placed an inverted tin washbasin over Groza's head
and a broom stick in his hand and a swatch of red cloth,
representing communism. They then placed a placard at the base of
the statue saying, ``You are staying here far too long. Aren't you
tired? Get down.''
   The protesters also carried posters reading ``Petru Groza, the
faker of the elections in 1946'' and ``Groza the founder of the
Romanian gulag.''
   The demonstrators them went to a nearby building site, took a
crane and quickly tore the statue down.
   The demolition of Lenin was not as easy, and work crews had to
labor for two full days with jackhammers and blowtorches before
they were able to dislodge the imposing figure from its marble base
in front of the recently renamed House of Free Press.
   ``After 30 years during which the star of Communist demagoguery
looked impassively toward red horizons defying generations of
Romanians who sacrificed their lives in the name of a utopian
ideal, the moment of truth has finally come,'' Romania Libera
commented on the removal of the Lenin statue.
   In the first days of the December revolution that overthrew
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Romanians tore the communist emblem out
of the center of their flag.

   President Bush paid tribute Wednesday to 28
``hometown heroes'' who he said are helping America win its war
against drugs.
   The anti-drug crusaders from 21 major cities were feted at a
White House luncheon where drug policy chief William Bennett
introduced them as ``the soldiers and the sergeants and the
lieutenants and the colonels'' in the fight.
   ``If we had 10,000 more like them, this (war) would be over in
about six months,'' Bennett told Bush.
   Bush said their efforts to drive drug dealers from their
neighborhoods and cities had ``proved to America that this war can
be won.''
   ``You are America's hometown heroes _ unconventional warriors,
but this is an unconventional war,'' Bush said.
   The president in recent months has seen firsthand the anti-drug
projects of two of those cited _ Alvin Brooks of the Ad Hoc Group
Against Crime in Kansas City, Mo., and Erma Scales' Acres Homes War
on Drugs Committee in Houston.
   ``We're going to keep on fighting against drugs and fighting for
you, for your neighborhoods and most of all for the kids,'' Bush
said.
   Bush also lauded Bennett's leadership.
   ``He's out there in the trenches. He's in the boardrooms. He's
everywhere. He's like Batman,'' Bush said, evoking laughter.
   The luncheon was held in the ornate Old Indian Treaty Room of
the Old Executive Office Building. Bush left loaded with anti-drug
T-shirts and other memorabilia. The honorees got M&amp;Ms in boxes with
the presidential seal.

   Seven people were killed
Wednesday when police fired on demonstrators in the black homeland
of Bophuthatswana, one of several black-ruled territories facing
growing unrest, reports said.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk said his government was
concerned the violence in the homelands could hinder efforts to
open negotiations on a new constitution that would include the
country's black majority.
   Speaking to journalists in Cape Town, de Klerk said negotiations
could not begin if there was ``anarchy'' in black areas.
   South African Foreign Minster Pik Botha said Wednesday night his
government's security forces were providing ``cooperative
assistance'' to Bophuthatswana.
   He did not say specifically whether troops had been sent to the
nominally independent homeland, but de Klerk said that step would
be taken if necessary.
   Dozens of blacks have died in recent days during violence in
several of South Africa's 10 black homelands. Most of the deaths
occurred in the southeastern homeland of Ciskei, where the military
staged a coup Sunday.
   South Africa sent troops into Ciskei on Monday to help quell
looting and rioting, and de Klerk said he would take similar action
in Bophuthatswana if necessary.
   In nominally independent Bophuthatswana, police using rifles and
tear gas battled some 50,000 protesters demanding the reintegration
of the homeland into South Africa.
   Clouds of smoke hung in the air after protesters set fire to
public buildings and vehicles and looted shops in Garankuwa, part
of the homeland 12 miles north of Pretoria, South Africa's capital.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg, quoting witnesses and
doctors, said at least seven people were killed and up to 500
others suffered various injuries.
   Protesters called for the resignation of homeland President
Lucas Mangope and waved placards denouncing his government.
   Mangope on Wednesday night declared a state of emergency in
several parts of the homeland, which has about 2 million residents
scattered over seven separate pieces of land.
   The independent South Africa Press Association quoted an
unidentified homeland official as saying that telephone lines in
and out of Bophuthatswana had been cut off ``for political
reasons.''
   South Africa established the homelands in the 1960s to try to
create separate, tribal-based states for blacks, while whites would
retain control of national politics and the economy. About 14
million of the country's 28 million blacks live in the territories.
   Activists in several of the homelands are demanding
reintegration into South Africa and calling for the end of
white-minority rule in South Africa. Four of the homelands are
nominally independent, although no nation but South Africa
recognizes them.
   In Ciskei, South African troops helped restore order Wednesday
after three days of rioting and looting that left at least 27
people dead and 550 injured.
   Dissident officers in the Ciskei military seized power Sunday in
a bloodless coup, but chaos erupted shortly afterward.
   Ciskei industrialists said the rampage that followed the coup
had shattered the economy and put 10,000 people out of jobs. Ray
Brentnall, head of the Ciskei Chamber of Industries, said rioting
caused damage worth millions of dollars, but did not give any
overall figure.
   ``People are very upset. After sweating blood to build up their
businesses it's heartbreaking to see them go up in flames,'' he
said.
   Many people in the Ciskei were opposed to the goverment of
ousted President Lennox Sebe, whose rule they considered oppressive
and corrupt.
   Sebe was in Hong Kong at the time of the coup. He was expected
to arrive in South Africa on Thursday.
   In other homelands:
   _ Scattered violence was reported Wednesday in KwaZulu, where
supporters of homeland leader Mangosutho Buthelezi have waged a
4-year-old power struggle against groups aligned with the African
National Congress guerrilla movement. Buthelezi met with de Klerk
on Wednesday for talks on the violence in the southeastern region.
   _ Government offices, schools, businesses and shops remained
closed in the northeastern homeland of Gazankulu as part of a
three-week-old protest led by activists demanding the ouster of
Chief Minister Hudson Ntsanwisi.

   Masked Sikh extremists opened fire with
rifles on a crowded market in Punjab state Wednesday night, killing
22 Hindus and wounded 42 others, officials said.
   At least 10 Sikh gunmen converged on the main market street of
Abohar and began shooting, deputy district commissioner Rakesh
Singh said in Ferozepur, district headquarters. He said 18 men and
one woman were killed instantly. Three more people died on the way
to the hospital, he said.
   Press Trust of India, citing unofficial reports, said about 25
people were killed in the attack.
   Two bombs planted in the market exploded during the shooting,
Singh said. Police suspected more bombs may have been planted along
the street and army bomb experts were investigating, he said.
   He said all the victims were Hindus and most were shopkeepers.
Abohar, a predominantly Hindu town with a population of about
96,000, is 125 miles southwest of Chandigarh and 200 miles
northwest of New Delhi.
   A police spokesman in Chandigarh, the state capital, said the
men were masked and arrived on foot.
   ``Nobody knows how they escaped,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   State police chief K.P.S. Gill said the ``assailants resorted to
indiscriminate firing followed by bomb blasts.''
   Sikh extremists, who have been fighting since 1982 for an
independent Sikh nation in Punjab called Khalistan, have killed
more than 370 people in the rich northern farming state so far this
year.
   Sikhs, who comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, have a slight majority in Punjab. Sikh militants complain
of political discrimination by the Hindus, who make up 82 percent
of the nation's population.
   The Sikh faith has roots in both Hinduism and Islam.

   About 500 mourners, half of them striking
Greyhound drivers in uniform, marched Wednesday in memory of a
driver crushed to death by a bus at a picket line.
   The mourners were led by the widow of 59-year-old Robert
Waterhouse, who was pinned against a building Saturday, the second
day of the nationwide strike, near the Greyhound depot by a bus
operated by a replacement driver. An investigation is under way,
but no charges have been filed.
   Walking with the aid of a cane and flanked by two longtime
co-workers of her husband, Dorie Waterhouse fought back tears as
she led the procession past a dozen parked buses and down the alley
where her husband died.
   ``He was a very gentle and unassuming man,'' Mrs. Waterhouse
said. ``This would overwhelm him. This is a tribute to my husband.
It has nothing to do with the strike.''
   About 50 drivers dropped flowers at the corner where Waterhouse
died.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions suspended
picketing for the day at the Redding Greyhound terminal. A few
non-striking Greyhound workers and passengers in the terminal
watched silently from inside.
   Local union leaders had requested that the funeral march not
involve any picket signs except for black armbands that said ``ATU
1225, Bob Waterhouse.''
   ``This is a memorial only. That was a unanimous decision,'' said
pallbearer Norm Barrington, a driver who worked with Waterhouse for
19 years.

<TEXT>
   Americans took out $3.54 billion more in
consumer credit than they retired in January as they flocked to
auto dealerships to lock in on newly reinstated sales incentives,
the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
   The Fed said overall consumer credit advanced at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.9 percent following a 7.3 percent gain in
December, when holiday shopping was at its peak. Consumer credit
includes all consumer loans except mortgages.
   Credit card debt slowed to a 1.4 percent gain at an annual rate
after rising 23.7 percent during the December holiday shopping
period.
   Revolving, or credit card, credit rose just $243 million in
January, compared to a $3.94 billion advance in December. It was
the lowest increase since a $904 million advance in September.
   Except for auto sales, sluggish consumer buying as the new year
began also was reflected in last week's Commerce Department report,
which showed that personal consumption spending slowed from a 1
percent gain in December to a 0.6 percent increase in January.
   Automobile credit, on the other hand, jumped a seasonally
adjusted $1.86 billion, 7.7 percent at an annual rate, after
falling 0.4 percent in December before rebates and lower interest
rates kicked in.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate were up
$1.45 billion, a sharp 8.6 percent advance, after a 3 percent gain
in December.
   But outstanding mobile home debt fell $18 million, a 0.9 percent
drop and the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
   Mobile home debt in December was revised Wedensday to a 0.9
percent decrease from the previously reported 1.9 percent increase.
That meant that mobile home debt fell in 11 of the last 12 months.
September's 2.8 percent gain was the exception.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of
January at $720.1 billion.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union plan
sharp increases in air service between the two nations, ending
cutbacks that began with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, a
State Department official said Wednesday.
   The official said that under a tentative agreement reached in
London last week, U.S. airlines would increase scheduled service to
Moscow and Leningrad and gain new rights to serve six additional
Soviet cities, including two in the Soviet Far East.
   These cities include Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine; Riga the
capital of Latvia; Minsk, the capital of Byelorussia; Tbilsi, the
capital of Soviet Georgia; and Magadan and Khabarovsk in the Soviet
Far East.
   Confirming the tentative agreement, State Department spokeswoman
Anita Stockman said Soviet airliners would be permitted to increase
trans-Atlantic service to New York City and Washington and would
gain new rights to serve Chicago and Miami with onward service to
two undisclosed points in South America.
   Soviet air service over the Pacific also would begin to
Anchorage, Alaska and to San Francisco with a mandatory stop in
Anchorage, the department said.
   Additionally, both nations would be allowed up to 100 charter
flights a year over the Atlantic.
   Positive consideration also would be given to additional charter
flights between the United States and the Soviet Union over the
Pacific, she said.
   Airlines of both nations would also have the right to increase
the number of weekly flights and to increase the number of airlines
designated to serve the expanded routes.
   Stockman said the agreement in principle was reached at a second
round of negotiations held in London last week to consider
expanding the Civil Air Transport Agreement between the two nations.
   The State Department said a third round of the talks will be
convened in London in late April to discuss financial provisions
and other remaining issues.
   Then-President Jimmy Carter ordered the Soviet airline Aeroflot
to stop its service to New York after Soviet troops moved into
Afghanistan in 1979.
   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ordered Aeroflot to terminate
its service to Washington, citing Soviet repression in Poland. That
halted all Soviet air service to the United States except for
Aeroflot flights carrying diplomatic personnel and goods intended
for Soviet embassies and consulates.
   Aeroflot's offices in New York and Washington were ordered
closed after the Soviets shot down a Korean passenger liner over
the Soviet Union in 1983.
   Commercial flights between the two nations were resumed in April
1986 with regularly scheduled Aeroflot flights landing here and Pan
American Airways flights landing in Moscow.
   The next year the two nations signed an agreement permitting the
expansion of air service beginning in May 1988.

   One of 13 defendants in the cult
slayings of a family of five was allowed to plead guilty Wednesday
to five reduced counts of murder in return for his promise to
testify for the prosecution.
   Richard E. Brand, 26, of Independence, Mo., was the first to
plead guilty in the shooting deaths of a couple and their three
daughters, who also were members of the cult.
   He had been charged with five counts of aggravated murder and
five counts of kidnapping, and could have faced the death penalty
if convicted.
   The prosecution says Brand led the victims into a barn at the
cult's farm in nearby Kirtland in northeast Ohio, bound them with
tape and watched as four of the five were shot.
   The bodies of Dennis Avery, 49, his wife, Cheryl, 42, and their
children _ Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 7 _ were unearthed
from a common grave in the barn Jan. 3-4.
   Brand told Lake County Common Pleas Judge James W. Jackson that
he helped cover up the bodies.
   Brand told Jackson that cult leader Jeffrey Lundgren recruited
him to help with the slayings, and said he considered Lundgren ``a
prophet of God.''
   ``He informed me I would be helping him in the killings,'' said
Brand, standing before the judge in blue jail coveralls and leg
irons.
   The plea could result in a sentence of 75 years to life for
Brand, who would serve at least 20 years, said prosecutor Steven
LaTourette.
   ``Justice is served because obviously we now have a valuable
witness,'' LaTourette said.
   The prosecutor said plea bargains with other defendants were
possible.
   Brand pleaded guilty to five counts of murder in return for
prosecutors agreeing to drop the aggravated murder and kidnapping
counts. LaTourette said his office would agree to seek dismissal of
those counts if Brand cooperates as promised.
   LaTourette has said the family was killed as part of a
``cleansing'' sacrifice before the cult left the Kirtland farm for
wilderness treks in West Virginia and Missouri.
   Lundgren is a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The church is separate from
the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, known as the Mormons, although they share beliefs.
   Lundgren had been a tour guide at the Kirtland temple.
   Four members, including Lundgren and his 19-year-old son, Damon
Lundgren, were arrested in San Diego. They are fighting extradition.
   The rest have been brought to Painesville to face charges that
include aggravated murder, kidnapping, conspiracy and complicity.
   Brand, who was facing extradition proceedings, agreed Feb. 5 to
return to Ohio from Kansas City, Mo., to face charges.
   Prosecutors said Brand was known to fellow cult members by the
code name ``Talon-1.'' He worked for two years for the nearby city
of Mentor as a sewer and drainage inspector.

   The Election Commission on Wednesday
canceled a Feb. 27 state by-election allegedly rigged by supporters
of a top leader of Prime Minister V.P. Singh's party.
   Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. Peri Sastry said new voting
had been ordered in the Meham constituency in Haryana state. The
state's chief minister, Om Prakash Chauthala, was the Janata Dal
party candidiate in Meham.
   Press Trust of India quoted Sastry as saying that the decision
was taken because ``the entire electoral process was vitiated.''
   Chauthala, who is also the eldest son of Deputy Prime Minister
Devi Lal, was linked by newspapers to widespread violence and vote
fraud in Meham.
   At least 13 people were killed in the constituency on Feb. 27-28
when new balloting was conducted in a few voting centers. Several
newspapers reported from Meham that Chauthala's supporters
allegedly instigated violence and stuffed hundreds of ballot boxes,
aided by the state police.
   Chauthala has denied the charges, saying they are politically
motivated. He has also not responded to demands by newspapers and
opposition parties that he resign.
   Most political parties, including the Janata Dal, had asked the
Election Commission to order new balloting in Meham.
   The decision followed investigations by an Election Commission
team which returned to New Delhi on Tuesday from Meham, 60 miles
northwest of the capital.
   Chauthala, who was appointed to the chief minister's elected
post, was required under Indian electoral laws to seek the voters'
mandate to ratify his position.
   He was named the chief minister after his father resigned from
the post to join the federal government as deputy prime minister.
   The by-election was held along with elections for eight state
legislatures and that of a federally controlled territory.
   Press Trust said the entire election process would have to begin
anew, which will take at least 31 days.

<HEAD>Two Want Sovereignty Commission Records Edited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two participants in the legal fight to
open the files of a defunct state segregation agency want a federal
appeals court to order the records edited to protect the privacy of
people listed in the files.
   John Salter Jr. of Grand Forks, N.D., and the Rev. Edwin King of
Jackson made thet request in a brief filed in the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
   They contend people's reputations would be unnecessarily damaged
if the records of the defunct Mississippi Sovereignty Commission
are opened without editing.
   ``The unrestricted release of the documents will destroy privacy
rights of hundreds of citizens, and will severely aggravate the
harm already suffered as a result of the commission's illegal
spying and disruptive activities,'' they said in the brief filed
recently by New York City attorney David Goldstein.
   Salter is a former Tougaloo College professor and King was
chaplain there during the 1960s. The commission spied on both men,
who were heavily involved in the civil rights struggle.
   The commission was established in 1956 to fight integration.
Gov. Bill Waller vetoed funding for the agency in 1973, and the
1977 Legislature sealed the files until 2027, citing the need to
protect the privacy of people named in the documents.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. on July 27 ordered
the agency's files unsealed, but delayed opening them pending the
appeal by King and Salter, who were among the plaintiffs who sued
to open the files.
   King and Salter's appeal seeks to keep private the names of
victims and of those who unknowingly aided the commission.
   Plaintiffs who are seeking to open the files maintain, however,
that the effort is a subterfuge to protect certain, unidentified
people.
   King and Salter oppose the release of information they describe
as private, saying the commission made claims of homosexuality,
drug use or communist affiliations against civil rights activists.
   In his ruling, Barbour said victims of commission skulduggery
could read the records before they were opened and supply any
desired response or rebuttal, which would be made part of the
permanent files.
   ``The judge has made it clear he believes state law as it exists
protects those (privacy) rights and we find that reasonable,'' said
Ken Lawrence, one of the plaintiffs. ``We would have accepted more
restrictions, but none of the sort King and Salter are suggesting.''

<TEXT>
   Nadia Comaneci, apparently upset over
the breakup of a personal relationship, canceled a lecture
scheduled for Wednesday night, her agent said.
   The speech, titled ``Vault into Freedom,'' at Nassau Community
College on Long Island was to have been the former Olympic
gymnast's first U.S. appearance on the lecture circuit, said Mike
Lewis, a spokesman for the college.
   Lewis said Comaneci's agent, Bob Davis of American Program
Bureau in Boston, called the college Wednesday to say she would not
be attending.
   Davis told The Associated Press he has not spoken to Comaneci
since she left for Tokyo more than a week ago with Constantin
Panait, a self-employed roofer who engineered her escape from
Romania last December.
   He said that people in her party have told him that Comaneci and
Panait, who has a wife and four children in Florida, had broken up
on the way back from Tokyo.
   He said Comaneci is staying with friends in Montreal, the site
of the 1976 Olympics where she won the first perfect scores in
Olympics gymnastics history. Panait is on the road, Davis said.
   A call to Comaneci reached an answering machine.
   Comaneci said in a recent magazine interview that she and Panait
had no plans to marry. She said last month that she intends to
marry a 30-year-old fellow Romanian who is expected to enter the
United States later this year.
   ``She was aware of her (speaking) engagement (but) her personal
life, I think, has changed,'' Davis said.
   She was to be paid $7,200 for the speech, which Lewis said would
not be rescheduled. The school had spent about $2,400 for
preparations and publicity, but did not plan any legal action
against Comaneci.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Alaska Forest Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government moved closer to changing its
management of Alaska's huge Tongass National Forest on Wednesday
when a Senate committee voted unanimously to modify contracts with
two timber companies.
   The bill approved by Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee also calls for increased environmental protections, but
does not go as far as the measure already passed by the House.
   That bill has tougher environmental provisions and would cancel
rather than modify the 50-year contracts the government has with
Alaska Pulp Co. and Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan.
   ``Who would have predicted we would end up with a unanimous 19-0
vote on such a contentious vote as Tongass?'' said Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has worked to preserve the timber
industry's position in the forest.
   Approval of the bill by the full Senate would send it to a
conference committee to work out differences with the House
version. Both chambers would then have to vote on the final product.
   Environmentalists interested in preserving wilderness areas have
focused on the forest, which is bigger than some states.
   But people in the five or so cities or communities that base
their economy on the forest's timber don't want the changes, said
some Wrangell, Alaska residents who were on hand for the committee
action. They said changes will cost the region jobs.
   The representatives of Alaska Women in Timber said Congress was
reneging on its promise to the two companies and at least one of
the companies would leave the area if the bill passed.
   ``When you invest so much of your life in an area, Congress
shouldn't dictate `we're going to make some changes, so you are
going to have to move,''' said Wilma Leslie, who operates an
independent tree-cutting company with her husband.
   But critics charge the companies have monopolized timber and
violated antitrust and labor laws. Supporters of the House version
say canceling the 50-year sweetheart deals would open the area to
competition from other firms.
   Provisions in the Senate bill would
   _delete from the law the $40 million appropriation that goes to
Tongass for road-building and other timber sale preparation
activities.
   _end the requirement that the Forest Service provide for sale
4.5 billion board feet of Tongass timber each decade. Instead, the
service would be obligated to ``seek to meet market demand for
timber.''
   _protect hundreds of thousands more acres of land in the 16.7
million-acre forest from logging.
   _create buffer zones around certain streams to protect fisheries.
   The contract modifications would make the deals with the two
companies conform with independent national forest timber sales and
strengthen Forest Service management of the Tongass.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday a printing
error in a recent report caused it to say wrongly that security
forces in Northern Ireland killed 39 people in 1989.
   Actually just two people were kiled by those forces, which
include the regular British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and
the Ulster Defense Regiment, the department said.
   The department stood by its statement in the report that 62
people were killed in terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland last
year, 23 of whom were members of the security forces.
   The report is a survey of human rights in all countries that the
State Department must submit to Congress each year.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision
to recognize the current Poland-Germany border is a positive and
important step, the White House said Wednesday.
   ``As the president has made clear, the U.S. recognizes the
current German-Polish border'' reaffirmed in the 1975 Helsinki
accord signed by 35 nations, said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Those borders were set when Germany was divided by the World War
II victors _ the United States, Soviet Union, France and Great
Britain.
   Poland is worried that if Germany is reunified, it would try to
retake territory that is now Poland but was part of Germany before
the war.
   Fitzwater said Kohl sent President Bush a message Wednesday
telling him of his reversal on the Poland matter.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Dismiss Charges as Prosecution Rests Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday refused to dismiss
charges against Joseph Hazelwood after the prosecution rested its
case and the defense offered a new theory on why the former Exxon
Valdez skipper should be cleared.
   Attorney Dick Madson argued that Hazelwood should be acquitted
of the charge of operating the vessel while intoxicated because he
technically was not in control of the tanker when it went aground
March 24, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   Basing his argument on case law involving drunken driving,
Madson said Hazelwood's decision to go below and turn over control
of the bridge to the third mate absolves him from responsibility
whether he was drunk or sober.
   ``The state is charging Captain Hazelwood with being intoxicated
and operating a vessel,'' said Madson. ``Under the law for driving
while intoxicated, he has to have direct control. ... Nowhere at
all can I find a case that an intoxicated person can be convicted
of DWI when they do not control the vehicle.''
   He drew the analogy to a person who is intoxicated, gets in a
cab and tells the driver where to go. If the driver runs a red
light and hits a school bus, then the person in the back seat
giving directions can not be liable.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said Coast Guard
regulations clearly require the captain to be sober, no matter
where he is on the ship. But the judge noted that Coast Guard
regulations do not apply in the trial because Hazelwood is charged
under state, law, not federal.
   Still, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone refused to drop the
charge, saying ``reasonable minds can differ'' on the allegations.
   He also declined to dismiss the felony charge of criminal
mischief and two other misdemeanors, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of oil.
   Johnstone also said he believes the Exxon Valdez was immovably
grounded once it hit Bligh Reef and could not have been driven off
the reef even if Hazelwood tried.
   But he said the question remained open whether he will instruct
the jury to disregard the skipper's efforts when they consider the
charges.
   Hazelwood's defense opened with testimony from a Valdez flower
shop owner who said the master bought flowers to be sent to his
hometown of Huntington, N.Y., on March 23, before he sailed.
   Emily Kaiser said she remembered Hazelwood clearly because she
also is from Huntington and they talked at length about their
hometown. She said he entered the shop between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
and put the purchase on a credit card which was recorded at 2:02
p.m.
   She said he showed no signs of intoxication: ``He was sober.''
   The prosecution rested its case after Madson tried to poke holes
in an expert's testimony that Hazelwood was drunk while in command
of the oil-laden ship.
   Richard Prouty acknowledged his method of calculating backwards
to determine someone's prior level of intoxication is a subject of
dispute among experts. He also said his results would have been
different had he different facts about Hazelwood's liquor
consumption before the captain boarded the tanker.
   Prouty said he was told by prosecutors that Hazelwood drank five
shots of 100-proof vodka in a period of seven hours before boarding
the ship the night it ran aground.
   Prouty, the chief forensic toxicologist with the Oklahoma
medical examiner's office, was the state's 45th and final witness
in 4{ weeks of testimony.
   Prouty said he used a combination of figures to ``calculate
backwards'' from blood and urine tests done on Hazelwood 10{ hours
after the grounding.
   He said Hazelwood's blood alcohol level would have been 0.14
percent at 12:05 a.m. when the tanker ran aground in Prince William
Sound.
   The legal limit in Alaska for driving a car is 0.10 percent. The
Coast Guard has a limit of 0.04 for operating a commercial vessel.
   Evidence on whether Hazelwood was drunk has been inconclusive,
but the issue remains a key factor in the prosecution's effort to
prove he was reckless.
   Hazelwood, 43, could get up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines if convicted on all counts.

   Withdrawals from savings institutions
accelerated in December, bringing outflows for all of 1989 to a
record $73.6 billion, the government said Wednesday.
   The industry lost $8.6 billion in deposits, excluding interest
credited, in December, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. That
was the biggest one-month drain since a $8.8 billion outflow in
September and the 18th in 19 months. Withdrawals totaled $4.8
billion in November and $6.3 billion in October.
   Outflows for the full year were the largest on record. The last
big outflow, $25.4 billion, occurred in 1981, when interest rates
for competing money-market mutual funds skyrocketed above 20
percent at a time when thrift rates were capped by law.
   Total deposits, with interest credited, declined $16 billion in
1989 to $946 billion.
   ``What you're seeing now is unprecedented ... but it's not
surprising,'' said economist Martin Regalia of the National Council
of Savings Institutions.
   Early in the year, the industry lost deposits in part because
S&amp;L problems had shaken customers' confidence. But economists say
the shrinkage in the last half of the year is almost entirely a
response to tough financial standards in the S&amp;L bailout
legislation enacted in August.
   The rules require thrifts to back their loans with more of their
owners' money. Most can't raise the capital and, as a result, must
trim their balance sheets.
   Thrifts shed $25.6 billion in assets in December, with $4.6
billion of that coming at S&amp;Ls under government control and almost
three-fourths of the remainder at weakly capitalized thrifts still
operating independently.
   S&amp;L assets at the end of the year totaled $1.25 trillion, down
$100 billion or 7.3 percent, from a year earlier. In contrast,
commercial bank assets grew 5.4 percent to $3.3 trillion.
   ``I think the (S&amp;L) downsizing is going to continue throughout
1990 and maybe into 1991 as well, although we might see some ebbing
of the pace,'' Regalia said.

   Three doctors stood on a train rail and
reached up into twisted metal, trying to save a woman's life by
amputating her leg.
   A female doctor, one of the first to arrive at the deadly subway
accident Wednesday morning, had to borrow a paramedic's buck knife
to amputate the leg of a dead man to free a survior caught
underneath.
   The accident on the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority subway line sent 20 paramedics and 10 doctors rushing
underground.
   The doctors discovered that all the rescue equipment in the
world was useless in some cases.
   A team of surgeons, Robert Dalsey and Rick Smith of the Medical
College of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson University's Murray
Cohen, amputated an unidentified woman's right leg when rescue
workers could not free her.
   ``I've never seen anything quite like this,'' said Dalsey. All
equipment ``that you could possibly want was there, but it was less
than ideal conditions. There was no obvious way to free her.''
   Dalsey said the woman was going into shock, unable to
communicate with the physicians. She died later at Hahnemann
Hospital, one of three dead and more than 160 injured in the
derailment.
   Smith said that working in the tunnel was a unique experience he
did not want to repeat.
   ``As an orthopedic surgeon, I'm used to seeing injuries in a
hospital, not in the field,'' he said.
   The tranist agency shut down all power to the tunnel to prevent
electrocutions, leaving medical crews with only portable light. Use
of emergency oxygen was out of the question _ the threat of fire
was too great.
   Dr. Jina Joder, an emergency physician at the Medical College,
was one of the first physicians to arrive.
   ``It was dark when I first got there. The medics already there
had begun IVs using flashlights (to see), and then the fire crew
set up generators and floodlights. Light was probably the biggest
problem,'' she said.
   She said she had to use a paramedics's buck knife to amputate
the leg of a dead man to free a man caught underneath him.
   Her hospital contracts with the city to train to the Fire
Department's paramedics, and provides physicians to direct
paramedics in the field, according to hospital trauma program
coordinator, Cindy Blank.
   Jefferson dispatched a four-person surgical team, the ``Jeff
State'' team, to the crash site to work with five surgeons and
three emergency medicine fellows from the Medical College,
according to hospital spokeswoman Betsy Samuels.
   At the emergency room of the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania, a team of more than 100 physicians and more than 50
nurses treated more than 40 patients, according to Dr. Sheldon
Jacobson, director of emergency medicine.
   More than four hours after the accident, Jacobson said, the
emergency room was finally ``almost back to normal.''

   Moslems blew up a truck carrying security
forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the
government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri
separatist uprising, officials said.
   In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they
said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in
an exchange of fire between militants and security forces,
officials said.
   Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three
parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said
Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state. There were no casualties, he
said.
   The curfew was relaxed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. to allow people in
the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials.
   An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security
forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators
marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally. At
least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the
predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu.
   Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, is the center of
the separatist movement.
   At least 171 people have been killed in Kashmir since a
government crackdown on the separatist movement began on Jan. 20.
   Leading national parties decided Wednesday to send a
``high-powered delegation'' to Srinagar, according to the Press
Trust of India news agency. It did not name the members, but it
said they would go Thursday.
   The decision was taken at the end of a daylong multiparty
meeting on Kashmir called by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. A joint
statement after the meeting said ``despite their ideological and
political differences, (the parties) were one in defending the
unity and integrity of the country,'' the news agency reported.
   Jagmohan said the truck was driving around Srinagar distributing
food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by Moslem
militants. He gave no further details of the attack.
   The attacks came amid government claims that security forces
arrested at least 12 leaders of the Moslem group Hezbul Mujahedeen.
Jagmohan said the militants, from Srinagar and the border towns of
Baramulla and Kupwara, have been arrested since Sunday.
   Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of 30 militant groups fighting for
secession. It is believed the second most powerful independence
group after the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
   ``We are going to hit hard at anti-national elements, there is
no way they can get away with what they are doing,'' Jagmohan said.
``It may take a month, six months, maybe a year, but ultimately
these anti-national elments are going to be neutralized.''
   Jagmohan, a Hindu, was appointed the state governor of
Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 18 in an attempt by the government to control
the unrest.
   Kashmir has been a problem for more than four decades following
the 1947 partition of British colonial India into predominantly
Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India.
   Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India.
Pakistan protested, claiming the territory because of its
predominantly Moslem population.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over the territory.
   The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir is mostly Moslem, while the
southern Jammu segment is predominantly Hindu. Overall, about 65
percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million
people and Hindus account for 82 percent.

   A senior education official said
Wednesday that China may extend to other institutions a program in
which Beijing University students were sent to a military academy
to build discipline.
   The university's freshman class of about 800 students was sent
to an academy in Hebei, south of the capital, for training that the
official press said included firing guns and throwing grenades.
   Beijing University played a major role last spring in the
student-led pro-democracy movement, which was crushed by the
military, and the school was singled out by the government as it
acted to prevent a repeat of the movement.
   On Wednesday, Teng Teng, vice chairman of the state education
commission, said of the military training program, ``If the
experiment works out, we can apply it to other institutions.''
   Teng spoke with reporters at Jomtien, near Bangkok, where he was
attending an international conference on education.
   He said that besides receiving military training, the Beijing
University students who participated also worked in factories and
on farms. The aim was to bring students into contact with soldiers,
workers and farmers ``to let them know what the realities are,''
Teng said.
   He said the program has had mixed results.
   ``Some of the effect is sound and some not so favorable,'' Teng
said without elaborating.
   But he added, ``It has greatly enhanced discipline among
students.''
   Teng said sending Chinese students to study in Europe and Japan
had worked out fairly well. But he complained that North America
kept the students, instead of their returning to work in China to
repay its investment in them.
   Teng said students should be free to express whatever political
views they hold but should not resort to ``radicalism.''
   ``Democracy can only be pursued on a gradual basis,'' he said.
``If education works well it can promote democracy. But if we
overstress the role of democracy it can give rise to riots and
chaos.''
   He said China wanted to improve its grade school system and
provide nine years of education for people in the coastal provinces
and at least six years for those in remoter inland areas.
   China also wants to place more emphasis on scientific and
technical teaching in colleges, he said.

<TEXT>
   Inflation speeded up in the United States and
other major industrial countries in 1989 for the third year in a
row, the International Monetary Fund reported Wednesday.
   Prices paid by consumers in the seven industrial countries rose
an average of 4.4 percent compared with 3.4 percent in 1988, 3
percent in 1987 and 2.4 percent in 1986.
   The fund calculated prices in the United States increased their
rise from 1.9 percent in 1986 to 4.8 percent last year.
   The fund said last year's overall increase last year was
``relatively moderate compared with the average annual increase of
about 7.9 percent registered during the period 1970-85.''
   Britain showed the biggest rise, to 7.8 percent, from 3.4
percent three years earlier, according to the report in the fund's
monthly ``IMF Memorandum.''
   The increase was also high in Italy, although complete figures
were not in. By last August, Italy was showing a 6.3 percent annual
inflation rate, compared with 5.1 percent for 1988.
   Japan, which had only a 0.6 percent inflation rate in 1986,
showed the smallest increase in 1989 at 2.3 percent. West Germany
had a 2.8 percent inflation rate last year, the fund said.
   Prices in France increased 3.5 percent in 1989 and Canada had a
5.2 annual inflation rate through November, the last month for
which the fund had figures.
   The fund reported a continued rapid rise in prices for consumers
in Third World countries, though only partial figures for 1989 were
available.
   It reported an average annual rate of 89.8 percent for 130
countries in August 1989, compared with 58.7 percent in 1988 and
26.7 percent in 1986.
   The western hemisphere, where figures were available for the
entire year, led the Third World with an average increase of 334.6
percent, far more than the annual rate of 82.4 percent in 1986.
   Prices in developing nations in the western hemisphere have
risen 11,677 percent since 1985, the fund said.
   That rise was heavily influenced by rates by Brazil, which
accounts for a third of Latin America's economy. Prices paid by
Brazilians rose 1,287 percent in 1989 after inflation of 682
percent in 1988.
   Argentina's inflation was even faster, reaching an annual rate
of 3,967 percent last August.
   Developing countries in Asia were much more successful in
holding down prices. South Korean prices rose 5.7 percent last
year, less than the year before. Most Asian countries appeared able
to keep inflation in single digits, though the fund had no figure
to show what happened after China reported 20.7 percent in 1988.

   President Bush issued a proclamation Wednesday
asking everybody who lives in the United States to truthfully
answer all questions on the 1990 Census.
   The Census Bureau is mailing out questionnaires March 23 to all
American households in its decennial head-counting exercise.
   Bush quoted Abraham Lincoln as saying, ``If we could just know
where we are and whither we are tending, we could better judge what
to do and how to do it.''
   ``The census helps to provide us with such insight,'' said Bush.
   The Census Bureau has enlisted 425,000 workers to ring
doorbells, canvass householders and even tally the homeless on
big-city streets. The forms by law must be filled out and returned
by April 1, the official ``Census Day.''
   The U.S. population has just passed the 250 million mark,
according to the latest Census estimate.
   There were only 3.9 million Americans in 1790 when U.S. marshals
carried out the first Census under the direction of then-Secretary
of State Thomas Jefferson, Bush noted. This will be the 21st census.
   ``Each decennial census has helped to chart the growth and
change experienced by our vast country during the past 200 years,''
said Bush.
   The primary purpose today, as in 1790, is to fix the state
population totals that determine the number of seats each state
gets in the House of Representatives.
   Bush said it also now serves to help reshape voting districts
for state and local governments, and plays an essential role in
allocating billions of dollars for education, health care, crime
prevention, transportation and other purposes.
   The information will help the government and private sector make
``critical decisions as we prepare to enter the 21st century,''
Bush said.
   ``It is the responsibility and obligation of every person who
usually resides in the United States to take part in the 1990
Census of Population and Housing by truthfully answering all
questions on the census forms applying to him or her and to each
member of the household to which he or she belongs,'' the president
proclaimed.
   Bush also assured the skittish the census results won't be
released in any way ``that will identify or harm any person or
household.''
   That means they cannot be used for tax-collection purposes, by
immigration authorities, for jury service or similar intrusive
purposes.
   The census is expected to cost $2.5 billion, a figure driven up
in part by an expected drop in the number of Americans who respond
by mail. Fewer mail responses means the Census Bureau has to do
more work to contact people.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said, ``The U.S.

<HEAD>Aid Official Welcomes Thai Decision to Open Neutral Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Western aid official Wednesday
welcomed the government's decision to establish a neutral camp for
more than 275,000 Cambodian refugees now under control of three
guerrilla groups.
   The guerrilla-run camps will be closed and the refugees sent to
the neutral grounds in preparation for their return home when the
11-year-old war in Cambodia ends.
   The deputy government spokesman, Likhit Hongladarom, said the
Cabinet made the decision at its weekly session Tuesday.
   The United Nations Border Relief Operation and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, which aid the camps along Thailand's
eastern border with Cambodia, have long favored establishing a
neutral camp.
   An unaffiliated camp would protect the refugees from being
forcibly repatriated by the guerrillas, or pressured to go to
certain areas of their homeland.
   ``We welcome the idea of starting the preparations for
repatriation,'' said the senior aid official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But he warned that guerrilla leaders may respond by quickening
their own repatriation of the refugees, without U.N. supervision.
   Aid officials say thousands of civilians under Khmer Rouge
guerrilla control have been moved out of the refugee camps in
recent months and resettled in strategic areas.
   The refugee camps were established shortly after Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the brutal Khmer Rouge regime,
sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to the Thai border.
   The three guerrilla groups _ the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front and the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk
_ have used the camps for military recruitment and to back their
claims to have a popular following.
   In briefing reporters on the Cabinet meeting, Likhit said
Tuesday that a neutral camp was needed because the refugees have
caused numerous problems for Thailand, particularly with security.
   ``The Thai government is not happy with the situation and has
therefore decided to close all refugee centers and to replace them
with a neutral camp, which is to be set up with United Nations
cooperation in the form of an assistance budget to feed the
refugees,'' he said.
   He said the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to contact the
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital,
and urge it to take back the refugees.
   Likhit also said Tuesday that Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan will also ask other nations to stop supplying the
Cambodian factions with weapons.

   The Reagan administration's top specialist on
Afghanistan said Wednesday that the United States has become
entangled in internal Afghan politics and that it must stop arming
the Mujahedeen rebels.
   Robert Peck, the State Department's chief analyst on Afghanistan
until last June, testified before two House subcommittees debating
the advisability of continued military support for the rebels.
   ``What disturbs me most about the American role in all this is
the degree to which the United States has become involved in what
are essentially internal Afghan affairs,'' Peck said.
   However, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly said the United
States was determined to keep supporting the Mujahedeen until
Soviet-installed President Najib is removed.
   Despite Bush administration predictions that the rebels would
defeat Najib once the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan in February
1989, the sides have been locked in a military stalemate.
   State Department officials are examining the direction of U.S.
policy in light of the stalemate, but the administration is under
strong pressure from many in Congress to maintain the aid program
for the rebels.
   Kelly rejected suggestions from Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
that the United States and Soviet Union negotiate a mutual halt to
arming the warring sides.
   Najib enjoys an advantage over the Mujahedeen in terms of
arsenals provided by the Soviet Union _ more than $300 million a
month _ and a cutoff of weapons would give him an unfair advantage,
Kelly said.
   The United States provides the Mujahedeen weapons, including
anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, through Pakistan. The program is
covert and reportedly costs $300 million to $400 million a year.
Saudi Arabia and several other countries also give money.
   The United States, Kelly said, also is pushing for a political
settlement that would include convening a summer leadership council
of all opposition elements from Afghanistan.
   Representatives of the council would negotiate with residents of
Afghan cities controlled by Najib's forces about forming a new
government through elections, Kelly said. The United States is
determined to exclude Najib from the process and believes the
Soviets can persuade him to step down, Kelly said.
   Peck said that the main U.S. task is to negotiate with the
Soviets an end to foreign arms supplies, but in such a way that
would deny Najib an unfair advantage.
   Kelly said the United States does not have much information
about this week's coup attempt against Najib launched by renegade
military officers, in part because U.S. Embassy personnel were
withdrawn from Kabul last year.
   He said the United States did not have advance word about the
attempted coup.

<HEAD>Navy Plans No Cutback in Trident Nuclear Sub Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy plans no reductions in the Trident
nuclear submarine program despite the warming of East-West
relations, the Navy's top submarine officer told a congressional
panel Wednesday.
   Vice Adm. Daniel L. Cooper told the House Seapower Subcommittee
that the Navy plans to build a total of 24 submarines at a rate of
one per year.
   ``Has the (Soviet) threat really changed?'' Cooper asked. ``As
we look at the Navy, we see no change,'' he answered.
   Cooper, the assistant chief of naval operations for undersea
warfare, said the Trident program the only leg of the nation's
nuclear triad of bombers, missiles and submarines that has been
modernized.
   Cooper also said that with improvements in submarine
communications, nuclear submarines will be able to shoulder a
larger share of the nation's strategic defense burden.
   Cooper's remarks were the first public affirmation since
President Bush submitted his budget in January that the Navy is
sticking to its plan of building one Trident per year at a cost of
about $1.2 billion each. Navy sources had said prior to the budget
announcement that the Trident program might be cut back to one
every other year.
   But slowing down Trident production, Cooper said, ``would have a
very great impact. One, I think, the cost of of a Trident submarine
would go up 10 to 15 percent. ... I strongly recommend that we
continue buying one a year.''

   Jacqueline Onassis agreed Wednesday to
give a group of Wampanoag Indians a plot of land and $100,000 in
exchange for a tiny beachfront site, ending an acrimonious 10-year
dispute over the property.
   The case pitted Mrs. Onassis' desire for privacy against the
Indians' belief that they should retain tribal lands on Martha's
Vineyard.
   ``After all this time I'm just happy the land was settled,''
said Selma Weissberg, one of the 25 descendants of William
Vanderhoop, a Wampanoag who lived in the area in the 1870s and
owned the 1.5-acre plot. ``I've lived on the island all my life and
I'm happy that we have some of our land back.''
   The agreement was ratified by Judge John S. Macdougall Jr. in
Dukes County Probate Court.
   At issue was a 1.5-acre section of land surrounded by Onassis'
estate but owned primarily by the Wampanoags, a tribe that has
lived at the picturesque cliffs of Gay Head for centuries.
   The tribe considers the land sacred. The Wampanoags believe the
tract is the last resting place of the great chief Moshup and his
wife, Squant. Tribal lore holds it was there that Moshup threw his
children into the sea when he foresaw the coming of the white man.
   The new plot of land is about two acres, with a 250-foot ocean
frontage, at Zack's Cliff in Gay Head.
   In 1980, Mrs. Onassis obtained one-sixth interest in the
1.5-acre plot, and sought to buy the remaining five-sixths from the
25 descendants of Vanderhoop. She wanted to close access to the
parcel and keep beachgoers and tourists away from her 400-acre
property.
   But the Wampanoags resisted and a series of lawsuits and
countersuits followed.
   According to the terms of the agreement signed Wednesday, the
Wampanoags will surrender title and access to the 1.5-acre site in
exchange for $100,000 and the larger section of beachfront 1,500
feet closer to the nearest road. Mrs. Onassis also will pay all
costs related to the land transfer and the Indians agreed to drop
all suits pending in the matter.
   ``This way, everybody wins,'' said attorney Paul Sulla, who
represented the Wampanoags. ``Until now, they've always been asked
to move from their land and given money. Now they've gotten some
land in exchange.''
   Brian Hurley, one of Mrs. Onassis attorneys, said: ``She's just
pleased to have resolved this long matter and hopes to continue
being good neighbors. She wants to put it behind her.''
   Since 1974, various Wampanoags have regained about 400 acres of
what they consider tribal land on Martha's Vineyard through a
series of federal lawsuits.
   They claimed that the 1790 Indian Non-Intercourse Act, which
forbids transfer of Indian lands without federal approval, was
violated in the 1870s when the state redistributed tribal lands to
other island residents.
   The Wampanoags have maintained a tribal structure for more than
370 years, according to tribal council president Donald Widdiss,
but they did not receive federal recognition until 1987. There are
only 250 Wampanoags left at Gay Head, and only 630 total in the
nation.

   Ministers of the left-leaning Labor Party on
Wednesday extended an ultimatum for quitting the coalition
government, giving Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc four
more days to approve U.S. peace proposals.
   About 2,500 right-wing demonstrators and Jewish settlers, by
police estimate, gathered in downtown Jerusalem Wednesday,
demanding that Shamir reject the proposals for Israeli-Palestinian
talks put forward by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   They held signs saying: ``Israel is not for sale,'' and ``People
of the Bible are returning to the land of the Bible.''
   Youths wearing knitted skullcaps danced in circles. A donkey
carrying an effigy of Baker stood nearby.
   The crowd included settlers from the occupied West Bank and
members of such right-wing and nationalist parties as Tehiya,
Moledet and Tzomet.
   Thwarted in their plans to march to Shamir's residence, some
gathered instead at the U.S. Consulate. Others walked the streets
with burning torches.
   Labor ministers announced the extension after the Inner Cabinet
failed to decide on the U.S. proposals in a two-hour meeting and
postponed a vote until Sunday.
   If Baker's proposals are not approved then, Labor's Central
Committee will meet Monday with a recommendation that the party
quit, toppling the 15-month-old government, Labor officials said.
   ``If Shamir uses some delay trick Sunday, we will view it as a
negative answer and respond as we have decided,'' Labor legislator
Chaim Ramon warned.
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of Labor predicted Shamir's Cabinet
would fall, saying: ``I don't think there is any possibility of
getting Likud to change their minds.''
   However, the extra time gives Shamir breathing room to negotiate
a compromise with Labor's leader, Vice Premier Shimon Peres.
   In an Israel Television interview, Peres said Wednesday's
extension was the last he was willing to grant Shamir.
   ``I think we have reached the end. He asked for two more days,
fine, I would not break the government apart over that. But if the
prime minister thinks he can prolong it on Sunday too ... that is a
mistake,'' Peres said.
   ``I think the countdown has started, and Likud ministers have
decided to put an end to the coalition government.''
   Peres said Labor ``may form a narrow government, go to
opposition or to new elections. I'm not promising anything.''
   Some Labor leaders are hesitant about withdrawing from the
government, notably Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Labor's No. 2
man.
   ``Maybe till Sunday reason would prevail in each camp,'' Rabin
said during a tour of northern Israel.
   Labor's Cabinet Minister Mordechai Gur expressed the same hope:
   ``I dare to say that reason will indeed prevail and we will be
able to find a common formula,'' he said on Israel army radio.
   At Wednesday's Cabinet session, Labor and Likud leaders argued
heatedly over Baker's proposals that call on Israel to agree to
including east Jerusalem Arabs and Palestinians deported by Israel
in preliminary peace talks planned for Cairo.
   The suggestions are a compromise with Palestinian demands for
direct PLO involvement in the talks, which Israel strongly opposes.
   Shamir opened the Cabinet meeting by reporting on a telephone
call from Baker on March 1. ``What about the decision of the
Israeli government?'' Shamir quoted Baker as asking, according to
Israel radio.
   ``The issue is serious, we still have to think,'' Shamir said he
replied.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud said Baker also refused to
back fully the Israeli withdrawal from Cairo talks if Palestinian
negotiators announce they represent the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Israel army radio reported.
   ``You will have to trust us,'' Arens said Baker told him at last
month's talks in Washington, to which Arens replied: ``We cannot
trust you in the issue of PLO.''
   According to Shahal, Peres read out Baker's proposals and
demanded a vote. Likud leaders balked, and Shamir said they would
continue discussions Sunday and then vote, Shahal added.
   The radio said the focus of debate was on involving 140,000 East
Jerusalem Arabs in the Israeli elections plan for the occupied
lands, seen as part of an interim settlement of self-rule for
Palestinians.
   The elections are expected to be the focus of the planned Cairo
talks.
   ``If East Jerusalem Arabs participate in the vote, is it not
tantamount to our agreeing to the division of Jerusalem?'' Arens
said in the meeting, according to Israel radio.
   Peres reportedly responded by chiding Arens: ``So you agree to
let Arabs in Nablus (the West Bank's largest town) into the
delegation. Does that mean you are ready to give up Nablus? This
already is progress.''
   Hard-liners in Likud fear allowing East Jerusalem Arabs to vote
will raise questions about Israel's annexation of the sector after
it was captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
   At least 659 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied lands, and 43 Israelis have died.

<HEAD>Congressmen Say Northrop Plea Bargain ``Inexcusable''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's plea bargain agreement with
the Northrop Corp., on alleged violations of defense contracting
procedures is ``utterly inexcusable,'' two congressmen said
Wednesday.
   Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Peter Smith, R-Vt., called
on the House Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and
national security to hold hearings on Northrop's agreement.
   ``We think this kind of activity on the part of our prosecutors
and court system, let alone the government, is utterly inexcusable
and indicates the potential for collusion,'' Shays and Smith said
in a letter.
   Northrop pleaded guilty last month to 34 federal counts related
to falsified testing of parts for the AV-8B Harrier jet and cruise
missile components, and agreed to a $17 million fine.
   In the plea bargain, the defense contractor entered guilty pleas
through attorney Richard Sauber to making false statements to the
government.
   The two congressmen said whistleblowers have alleged as much as
$20 billion was lost or stolen during the classified phase of the
B-2 stealth bomber program. Northrop manufactures the radar-evading
plane.
   ``Northrop, as you also know, has a long and some say one of the
worst, records with regard to compliance with federal regulations
when it comes to procurement and acquisition,'' Shays and Smith
said.
   On Feb. 27, the day of the agreement, the Los Angeles-based
Northrop issued a statement, saying:
   ``The U.S. government and Northrop Corporation reached a complex
compromise today under which the government agreed to withdraw
various charges the company had been contesting for over a year,
and Northrop in turn agreed to pay a $17 million fine for charges
arising out of actions by some employees it subsequently fired in
1987 from its now closed Western Services Department.''

<HEAD>Washington Gives $25 Million in Emergency Aid to Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA VICTORIA GONZALEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday agreed
to provide $25.1 million in emergency aid to Panama to help it
rebuild from the American invasion, but President Guillermo Endara
asked for more.
   Wednesday's agreement was the first in a series of aid packages
the Bush administration plans for Panama. It is trying to revive
the economy, which suffered from a decade of rule by Manuel Antonio
Noriega and from economic sanctions the United States imposed
trying to force the general from power.
   Endara and U.S. Ambassador Deane R. Hinton signed the aid
agreement at the Metropolitan Cathedral. The president, installed
by the U.S. forces on Dec. 20, is in the seventh day of a hunger
strike there to protest an attempt by some U.S. congressmen to cut
overall aid for Panama.
   ``This isn't much, but it's a beginning,'' Hinton told Endara
during the signing ceremony.
   ``Let's hope the rest comes as soon as possible,'' Endara
replied.
   Under the agreement, the U.S. Agency for International
Development will provide $25.1 million within 150 days for
projects, mainly to repair damage caused by the invasion.
   Of that total, $13.6 million will be distributed in cash to
about 1,500 families left homeless as a result of fires during the
fighting in Panama City's El Chorrillo district. The money has been
set aside so they can purchase new housing.
   About $7 million will provide temporary jobs to 3,000 people for
up to three months repairing roads and other public facilities and
for projects to protect the environment. The work includes
repairing public schools, drain pipes, a building to house the
Supreme Court of Justice and reforestation.
   Another $4.5 million will go for technical assistance and the
purchase of government equipment.
   Among Panama's most pressing problems are a housing shortage and
lack of jobs.
   Endara, 53, began his hunger strike March 1 at the Cathedral,
announcing he was acting ``in solidarity with my fellow citizens in
Panama who suffer malnutrition because of poverty.''
   Although he made no explicit mention of U.S. aid, he hinted he
was also protesting efforts led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to
cut sharply the $500 million in Panamanian aid requested by
President Bush.
   For a few days in September, Endara, then a leading opposition
member, also staged a hunger strike. At that time, he was
protesting police brutality under Noriega, whom he replaced with
the support of U.S. forces. Noriega is now in Miami where he faces
drug charges.
   Endara was leading last May's national elections by a 3-1 margin
when Noriega annuled the vote-counting.

<TEXT>
   Black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela thanked Tanzania on Wednesday for helping his African
National Congress in its fight against South Africa's white
government.
   More than 40,000 people gathered in a stadium to honor the ANC
deputy president, who last month was freed after 27 years in prison
in South Africa. Mandela arrived from Harare, Zimbabwe, on Tuesday.
   Thousands of exiled ANC members live in Tanzania and most are to
return home by the end of the year. The Pretoria government
recently legalized the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups,
legitimizing them for the first time in 30 years.
   Mandela told the rally in Dar Es Salaam the ANC had asked
Tanzania's ruling party for help with grass-roots organizing. He
noted the party's organizational strength through committees and
political leaders in each of the East African nation's
neighborhoods and villages.
   ``We are hopeful our request will be met,'' Mandela said,
indicating he hoped the ANC could build a similar organization in
South Africa.
   On the second of his six days in Tanzania, Mandela also thanked
former President Julius Nyerere for helping the ANC and other
movements.
   He referred to the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, the
Zimbabwe National Union and Zimbabwe African People's National
Union, Namibia's South-West Africa People's Organization and the
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
   All of the groups operated from Tanzania at one time or another.
   Mandela said the first ANC guerrillas to take up the armed
struggle for black majority rule in South Africa were trained in
Tanzania nearly 30 years ago and their camps remain in the country.
   He said Tanzania ``again opened its doors'' when the ANC was
forced to evacuate its fighters from Angola following a
U.S.-brokered agreement between South Africa, Angola and Cuba that
called for Namibia's independence. The South African territory is
scheduled to become independent on March 21.
   Tanzania has never publicly acknowledged the existence of the
guerrilla camps, saying only that South African refugees were in
its territory.
   On Thursday, Mandela was to fly to the semi-autonomous island of
Zanzibar, then return to the mainland town of Iringa, where Western
diplomats say there are between 3,000 and 4,000 ANC guerrillas in
five secret camps.
   The rally at the national stadium began with Prime Minister
Joseph Warioba bestowing on Mandela the Order of the Torch of
Kilimanjaro, 2nd Class. The medal is named after Africa's highest
peak, which rises to a height of 19,200 feet in northern Tanzania.
   The only other foreigner to receive the honor was the late
Mozambique President Samora Machel, who waged a guerrilla war
against the Portuguese colonists in his homeland from southern
Tanzania.
   Earlier, local authorities in Dar es Salaam made Mandela an
honorary citizen of the city and renamed one of its major
thoroughfares Nelson Mandela Expressway.

   A buildup of methane gas emerged
Wednesday as the suspected cause of an explosion that leveled a
bank, killing three employees and injuring 14 other people,
authorities said.
   Preliminary autopsy results released earlier Wednesday
discounted a bomb as the cause of the explosion Tuesday at the
Crested Butte State Bank in this Rocky Mountain ski resort town.
   Seven people remained hospitalized in Grand Junction and
Gunnison, three in serious condition.
   Montrose pathologist Dr. Mike Benzinger said he discounted a
bomb as a cause after examining preliminary results of autopsies on
the three dead women.
   There were no marks on the victims' bodies to indicate
explosives were involved, Benzinger said.
   The blast, which occurred as the bank was opening for business,
leveled the two-story brick building, reducing everything except
the vault to rubble.
   The victims were identified as Donna Smith, 33; Jade Woelk; and
Monica Henning, all of Crested Butte. The ages of the other victims
were not available.
   State and local investigators would not speculate further on the
cause of the explosion until federal investigators began examining
the site.
   U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms personnel began
arriving Wednesday.
   Methane as the cause ``is my most fervent hope,'' said Hank
Smith, police chief in Mount Crested Butte. ``We'll wait for
confirmation from ATF and then we'll call the mine inspectors.''
   Methane is odorless and colorless, detectable only by hand-held
instruments, said Bill Denning, an inspector with the U.S. Mine
Safety and Health Administration in Denver.
   Denning said it was possible that coal beds beneath or around
the town might be producing methane, as could an abandoned and
sealed mine in the vicinity.
   Methane also is found in landfills because it is the product of
decomposing organic material, Denning said.
   A spark is needed to ignite methane, said Denning, and ``there
would be an abundance of potential spark sources'' in the bank.
``Sometimes all it takes is a light switch,'' he said.
   Workers on Wednesday opened a temporary bank next door to the
explosion site. The staff included an injured executive vice
president and a retired bank employee.
   The rest of the town tried to resume normal business operations.
   ``It's hard to watch people on vacation when you're in a
tragedy,'' said Hope Ostheimer, a clerk in an office supply store.
``It's hard to hear them complain about not getting their checks
cashed. Some are real sensitive, but others aren't, and then there
are the ones who dug through the rubble with all the rest of us
yesterday trying to find our friends.
   ``I guess I'm just angry. You feel so enraged because you don't
know what happened yet. You just know they're dead and hurt,'' she
said.

   Two masked men Wednesday shot and killed
a prominent liberal journalist who was an outspoken critic of
terrorism and Moslem fundamentalists.
   Hours later an unknown Islamic group claimed responsibility for
killing Cetin Emec and his driver.
   Emec, 55, was a board member and columnist of Turkey's largest
circulation newspaper, Hurriyet.
   Witnesses said the assailants opened fire as Emec was getting
into his car near his home to go to work.
   The driver, Sinan Ercan, started running but was fatally shot in
the back, said Istanbul police chief Hamdi Ardali. He said Emec was
struck by seven bullets.
   In his last column, published Wednesday, Emec expressed alarm at
the resurgence of terrorism in Turkey. He accused Syria of
supporting terrorist groups in the region and claimed Syrian
leaders were behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland
in December 1988.
   A group calling itself the Union of Turkish Islamic Commandos
telephoned Hurriyet and two other Turkish dailies to claim
responsibility for Emec's slaying. The caller, speaking Turkish,
said: ``We killed Emec and now it is your turn. We will kill you
one by one,'' according to Hurriyet editors.
   The caller to the newspaper Gunaydin said: ``We killed him
because he was an enemy of Islam.''
   President Turgut Ozal denounced the attack. ``The assailants and
the treacherous people behind them should know that they will not
succeed in ruining the calm and stability of our country with
terrorism,'' he said.
   Turkish journalist associations said Thursday editions of
Istanbul's major dailies would be printed with black mastheads,
instead of the usual red, in mourning.
   Emec, the son of a newspaper publisher, was known for his
liberal and secular views and often criticized the Moslem
fundamentalist minority in Turkey. Close friends, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Emec had received threats and hate
mail recently from Islamic groups.

   President Bush's nominee to the nation's top
civil rights enforcement job came under fire Wednesday, but a
Democratic senator said it appeared likely John R. Dunne would be
confirmed.
   ``I'm not sure President Bush would appoint anybody better than
you,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbau, D-Ohio, told Dunne. ``Regardless of
how I vote, you're going to be confirmed.''
   Dunne, 60, was tapped in January to be assistant attorney
general for civil rights. The post has been vacant since December
1988 when William Bradford Reynolds resigned.
   The former New York state senator was questioned Wednesday about
his long membership in two private clubs that barred women and
about his investments in companies that do business in South Africa.
   ``If you had it to do ever again, in retrospect, do you think
you might have taken a different course of conduct?'' Metzenbaum
asked in regard to joining the all-male clubs.
   ``I believe I would have,'' Dunne replied.
   Dunne became a member of the Long Island Garden City Golf Club
in 1957, quitting when his nomination to the civil rights post
appeared imminent. The second club, the Fort Orange Club in Albany,
N.Y., began admitting women in 1988.
   ``I think on balance, maybe even more than balance, you'll find
someone who is sensitive to the needs of women, as well as any
other group that requires protection,'' Dunne said.
   Nominee William C. Lucas was rejected in August on a 7-7
committee vote. Lucas, a black, was opposed by many civil rights
groups because he sided with Bush on recent a Supreme Court ruling
that expanded opportunities to challenge affirmative action
policies.
   Dunne, who was a state senator for 24 years, has been criticized
by civil rights groups for having very little civil rights
experience. He is white.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who chaired the hearing, asked Dunne to
explain his position on apartheid in light of the fact that he and
his law firm hold stock in companies that do business in South
Africa and that he voted against a measure requiring New York state
to divest such holdings.
   ``Let me put right up in the front: I hate, if one can hate, the
principle of apartheid,'' Dunne replied. ``The three items ... are
unconnected and not indicative of an attitude that favors that
system.''
   The Associated Press reported last week that Dunne holds almost
$20,000 worth of stock in Schlumberger Ltd., a New York-based
company engaged in oil field services and oil products
manufacturing.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, has said his group would
neither endorse nor oppose Dunne.
   Simon aide John Travesina said the committee would probably vote
March 22.

<HEAD>Medical Assocation Calls for Expanded Medicaid, More Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association on Wednesday
proposed expanding Medicaid and requiring employers to provide
medical insurance to full-time employees to help fill the gaps in
the nation's health care system.
   The AMA also called for the creation of state risk pools to
provide group insurance policies for those who cannot afford
coverage under the current system _ including small businesses and
the self-employed _ and for individuals whose illnesses make them
medically uninsurable.
   The changes are aimed at providing access to health care for all
Americans, including the estimated 33 million who have no medical
insurance, regardless of income.
   AMA officials, who unveiled the plan at a news conference,
declined to put a total price on the package, but said the Medicaid
expansion would probably cost about $30 billion a year.
   An AMA source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a
``fair estimate'' for the whole package was about $60 billion a
year.
   Dr. Alan R. Nelson, AMA president, did not suggest specifically
how the plan would be financed. But he said, ``almost certainly
this would require some increased taxes.''
   James S. Todd, acting executive vice president of the AMA, said
talking about the cost of the package would detract from the plan
itself.
   ``We don't want to see the concept deep-sixed because someone
put a price on it,'' he said. ``We don't think you should make
health care decisions based on what it will cost'' but rather on
what is ``appropriate and needed.''
   The AMA said the plan corrects weaknesses in the current system
while building on its strengths, including patients' freedom to
choose their health-care provider.
   ``The individual's freedom of choice remains a cornerstone of
the American system,'' Nelson said. Though revision of the current
system is ``badly needed ... it would be counterproductive to `fix'
aspects of our system that are not broken,'' he said.
   The AMA's proposal is similar to a $66 billion plan recommended
last week by the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health
Care, known as the Pepper Commission for its first chairman, the
late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   The nation's health-care bill is expected to reach $600 billion
this year, more than 11 percent of the gross national product.
   The highlights of the AMA plan include:
   _Expanding Medicaid to all people below the poverty level and
establishing uniform benefits. Medicaid now covers fewer than half
of those living below the poverty line, and eligibility and
benefits vary from state to state.
   _Requiring employers to provide health insurance for all
full-time employees and their families and eliminating
state-mandated benefits. Employers would be allowed tax deductions
to help with costs.
   _Establishing state risk pools funded with tax revenues or
insurance company contributions to make coverage available for
those who can't afford or can't get insurance. About 15 states
currently have such pools.
   _Expanding private sector coverage of long-term care with tax
incentives.
   _Revising medical malpractice laws to reduce liability insurance
costs for physicians and the practice of defensive medicine, such
as ordering tests and procedures that otherwise might not be
ordered.
   Also Wednesday, the Institute of Medicine recommended changes in
the current monitoring of Medicare services to increase emphasis on
quality of care.
   ``The current system is viewed by nearly all concerned as
ineffective,'' said Kathleen Lohr, who directed the study for the
institute, which is chartered by the National Academy of Sciences.
   The report recommends a plan that would be phased in over 10
years to shift the focus of the monitoring program from containing
costs to tracking and evaluating the care of patients.

   A jury of seven women and five men was sworn
in Wednesday for the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter, whose
lawyers were attempting to sharply curtail any damaging testimony
from Oliver North, the government's leadoff witness.
   The jury was sent home for the day, after being selected from a
pool of 45 people, as U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene
considered the question of whether to limit North's testimony. Jury
selection took just three days, as opposed to more than a week in
the North trial last year.
   Many of the jurors said they had heard of North but knew little
about Poindexter, his former boss who many failed to recognize in
the courtroom.
   The jurors include a bridal consultant, a university accountant,
a postal worker, a retired food-service worker and a housewife. One
of the six alternate jurors is a retiree who got the Watergate
scandal confused with the Iran-Contra affair.
   At a hearing, prosecutor John Barrett argued that North should
testify that he saw Poindexter destroy a presidential finding on
Iran and that Poindexter forced North to lie about the Contras to
Congress.
   Poindexter lawyer Stephen McNabb said North testimony on those
two subjects should not be permitted because it was based on
earlier testimony Poindexter gave Congress in 1987 under a grant of
immunity from prosecution.
   At his trial last year, North testified that he witnessed
Poindexter destroy then-President Reagan's finding, which depicted
the Iran initiative as a straight arms-for-hostages deal. North
recently said his knowledge of the destruction was based on
Poindexter's immunized testimony.
   But ``North is a witness who doesn't want to testify for the
government,'' Barrett said, suggesting North's was merely trying to
avoid harming his former boss.
   Regarding the Contras, Barrett said that North's and
Poindexter's stories contradict each other about a crucial Aug. 6,
1986, meeting with congressmen at the White House. At that meeting,
North falsely denied assisting the Contras militarily.
   Poindexter has testified to Congress that North assured him he
could handle the meeting with the congressmen. North has said the
opposite, that he was reluctant to talk with them because he would
have to conceal a number of matters, but that Poindexter directed
him to do so. North admitted that he lied at the meeting.
   Greene denied one motion by Poindexter's lawyers to prevent all
or part of North's testimony and said he will rule on the other one
limiting by the time North takes the witness stand.
   ``I gather'' that North ``will be the first government witness''
in the case against Poindexter, Greene said in revealing that
Poindexter had filed the sealed motions. Lawyers in the case later
confirmed that North would indeed be the first witness.
   Opening statements are planned for Thursday.
   Greene said he would consider a Poindexter motion seeking to
limit North's testimony, based on Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination.
   The judge denied the other motion, which he said was based on
``perjury'' that North ``allegedly committed.''
   The government alleged at North's trial last year that he had
given unreliable testimony when he took the witness stand in his
own defense, Richard Beckler, a lawyer for Poindexter, later
explained.
   In closing arguments at North's trial, prosecutor John Keker
said the former White House aide ``had gotten in the habit of
lying'' in the Iran-Contra affair and that he ``wasn't stopping
now'' once he took the witness stand in his own defense.
   North made a number of statements at his trial last year that
could be extremely damaging to Poindexter if repeated in the new
trial.
   For example, he said he told Poindexter that it would be unwise
to have a meeting in August 1986 with House members inquiring into
whether North was assisting the Contras militarily. Poindexter
insisted that North brief the lawmakers anyway, telling his
subordinate that ``you can handle it ... you can take care of it,''
North testified.
   North admitted on the witness stand that he had lied to the
lawmakers. Poindexter later sent him a message saying, ``Well
done.'' The incident forms part of the indictment against the
ex-national security adviser.
   North is appealing his convictions on three felonies: aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress in connection with a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran, altering and destroying
classified National Security Councl documents pertaining to North's
assistance to the Contras and accepting a $13,800 home security
system from Richard Secord.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing and lying to Congress in
five felony charges concerning the missile shipment and allegations
that he covered up North's secret resupply network to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Greene in December placed limitations on North's testimony at
Poindexter's trial. The judge ruled that prosecutors may only
elicit evidence based on statements North made before July 15,
1987, the day Poindexter began giving testimony to Congress on
national television under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   North has said he is unable to differentiate what he knows from
Poindexter's immunized testimony and what he knows from his own
experiences in the Iran-Contra affair. Under federal law, no part
of the prosecution's case may be derived from a defendant's
immunized testimony.

   Arthur Fletcher, the newly appointed chairman
of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, on Wednesday underwent his
second triple bypass heart surgery in less than six months, an
agency spokeswoman said.
   Fletcher, who was named chairman by President Bush last month,
entered George Washington University Hospital on Monday after
doctors concluded previous bypass surgery ``didn't take,'' said
Barbara Brooks, spokeswoman for the commission.
   Hospital spokeswoman Claudia Dominitz said the surgery
Wednesdsay ``went well. He's doing fine.''
   The 65-year-old Fletcher underwent emergency open-heart surgery
last November in Yakima, Wash., after traveling to Washington state
for a speaking engagement. Brooks said he went to the George
Washington hospital for a follow-up examination and went into
surgery again Wednesday morning.
   ``According to his wife, the other surgery didn't take,'' said
Brooks. She said doctors told family members ``his three bypass
grafts occluded and the arteries are blocked again.''
   Fletcher, who served as chairman at his first commission meeting
last week, is expected to be out recuperating for six to eight
weeks, Brooks said.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Predicts Communist Defeat in Bulgarian Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of the democratic opposition
predicted on Wednesday that Bulgaria's ruling Communist Party will
suffer a crushing defeat in free elections he hopes will take place
this year.
   But Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces,
cautioned that the Communists, led by Premier Andrei Lukanov, are
still a force to reckon with.
   ``We will win the elections without underestimating the
Communist Party, which is still strong, though demoralized by
now,'' Zhelev said.
   ``But if we have just, democratic and honest elections I think
we will win, and for us it is not only a question of winning but
doing so by a large, crushing majority.''
   On Jan. 15, Parliament abolished the guaranteed leading role of
Bulgaria's Communist Party in the wave of reforms sweeping Eastern
Europe.
   Zhelev said a big win was imperative to establishing a strong
government supported by the people ``to carry out the required
reforms in the future.''
   ``This type of administration will have to take unpopular
measures, which underscores the need for a strong authoritative
government ... (which) can ask people to make sacrifices and bear
with restrictions for a period of time,'' he said.
   Zhelev said his alliance wants two rounds of elections this year.
   A preliminary round, already scheduled for June by the Communist
government, would choose a National Assembly to draft a new
constitution, to be followed by full-scale democratic elections
toward the end of the year.
   ``I think we can fight for this,'' Zhelev said. ``But if the
Communist Party tries to torpedo the plan we will turn to the
people'' with rallies, demonstrations and perhaps a referendum.
   Zhelev said his proposed two-stage election process was crucial
for the opposition ``because we have no experience whatsoever, no
material base, no people well-known to the public.''
   He said he hoped talks between the Communists and opposition
groups would resume Monday and that the Communists would sign a
crucial agreement on the country's democratic future.
   Meetings were suspended Feb. 12 after the Communists refused to
remove party cells from the workplace and sign a political accord
considered vital by the opposition.
   The Communists have since said they are willing to disband the
cells.
   The political agreement he wants signed would provide for the
clear separation of party and state and the end of state financing
for the Communist Party, Zhelev said.
   Bulgaria also is beset by an economic crisis. It owes the West
$10.8 billion and is experiencing a worsening shortage of consumer
goods, including inadequate food supplies in parts of the country.
   Bulgarian reforms began in earnest last Nov. 10 with the ouster
of Todor Zhivkov, the longtime, hard-line Communist Party chief.
Large demonstrations for democracy followed that led to many of the
old guard leaders being expelled from the party.
   The rallies in Sofia were the largest since the Communists
consolidated power 43 years earlier.
   By December, the party's Central Committee was yielding to
demands for reforms. Parliament passed an amnesty for political
prisoners and erased ``anti-state activity'' and ``crimes against
allied states'' from the penal code.
   On Dec. 27, the government and the Union of Democratic Forces
agreed to hold talks.

   Groups of senators maneuvered behind the
scenes Wednesday hoping to toughen controls on automobile and
industrial pollution as well as to require automakers to produce
more fuel efficient cars.
   As a stream of minor amendments to the clean air bill was
debated on the Senate floor, industry lobbyists and the Bush
administration sought to blunt attempts to stengthen the bill.
   Transporation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in a letter to key
senators that a proposal that would require automakers dramatically
to improve fuel economy would ``have a devastating impact'' on the
auto industry and consumers, forcing automakers to concentrate on
making smaller cars.
   The fuel economy provision, which was in the orignal bill
approved by a Senate committee, was strongly opposed by the
administration and the auto industry and was deleted during the
negotiations between Senate leaders and the White House that
produced the bill now being debated.
   But several senators said Wednesday they will try to revive the
proposal, which would require automakers to curb carbon dioxide
emissions because of concern about global warming. The auto
industry said such curbs would require them to produce cars with a
fleet average of 40 miles per gallon compared with the current
requirement of 27.5 mpg.
   ``It would cost thousands and thousands of jobs ... (and)
decimate the domestic automobile industry,'' said Sen. Don Nickels,
R-Okla.
   But other senators including Sens. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., Bob
Kerry, D-Mass., and Richard Bryan, D-Nev., have argued that
controls on carbon dioxide are needed to deal with global warming.
   ``Carbon dioxide is responsible for nearly half of the
greenhouse effect,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., ``and motor
vehicles are the largest single source of carbon dixoide
emissions.''
   Carbon dioxide is an inevitable product of all combustion of
fossil fuels. It also traps heat that would be radiated by the
earth into space, leading many scientists to predict that its
buildup in the atmosphere will mena a warming of the earth. The
less gasoline burned, the less carbon dioxide produced.
   The compromise bill calls for sweeping regulations on
smog-causing pollution from automobiles and industry, requires
controls on 191 toxic industrial chemicals and would require cuts
in acid rain pollutants from coal-burning electric utility plants
and factories.
   Some Republican senators complained late Wednesday that the
complex pollution control bill was being pushed through the Senate
too quickly.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told his
colleagues he wanted to complete action on the legislation by the
end of the week when the Senate goes on a week-long recess. He
threatened to keep the senators in session into the weekend if
necessary.
   That prompted complaints from Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo.,
that the legislation was being ``rammed down our throats'' without
enough time to examine details. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he
had only seen the bill on Monday.
   ``We've got to complete this bill,'' responded Mitchell, adding
that the more time that is spent the more proposed amendments are
likely to appear. Delays beyond the upcoming recess could ``result
in very lengthy delays, perhaps defeat of the bill,'' said Mitchell.
   In addition to auto emission controls, senators also said they
planned to offer amendments that would restore a provision under
which the Environmental Protection Agency could impose a pollution
control plan on a city if state and local officials do not act.
   That authority, which is in current law, was deleted during the
closed-door negotiations.

   One manufacturer of infant pillows and
cushions the government said was involved in the suffocation of 10
babies in two years said Wednesday that it voluntarily removed its
product from stores earlier this year.
   Leo Hollander, owner of Hollander Home Fashions of Newark, N.J.,
said the company stopped making its ``Mother's Helper Cushion'' in
January and told distributors to remove them from stores.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., urged the Consumer Product Safety
Commission on Tuesday to recall all the infant pillows that have
been linked to the deaths, inlcuding seven since June.
   ``It's time to get get the product off the shelves and out of
the hands of consumers before any other children are put at risk,''
D'Amato said.
   Hollander said his company ``does not believe that its product
is responsible for the death of any infant. ... The product
labeling warns parents never to leave their children unattended.''
   He said infants under 5-months-old should never be placed face
down and left alone to sleep on any type of pillows.
   ``Furthermore no pillow should be used for very young infants in
their cribs,'' he said.
   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the company voluntarily recalled
400,000 cushions Wednesday.
   But Hollander said the company did not recall cushions bought by
consumers and only took the action with its distributors ``awaiting
CPSC determination.''
   ``The CPSC has not determined that this product is the cause of
this problem,'' he said.
   The agency on Tuesday warned parents not to let infants sleep on
the miniature bean bags because 10 babies using the items have
suffocated since December 1987.
   ``As a result of our investigation we know that at least 10
companies manufacture a similar product,'' Rumelt said.
   The agency said negotiations for a recall were continuing with
other companies, which it declined to identify.

   State child welfare agencies are struggling to
meet the needs of a growing number of babies born to crack-addicted
women, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.
   Many experts said that providing protective services, social
services or foster care for such children is more complex than for
other child welfare cases because there is more abandonment and
violence.
   ``Case workers can spend days tracking mothers who give false
addresses to hospitals and then abandon their babies,'' the report
by the inspector general said.
   In some cities, caseworkers are so overwhelmed that hospitals
are stepping in with their own efforts to recruit foster parents,
the report said.
   Child welfare administrators and caseworkers, hospital social
services staff, foster parents and state and local officials in 12
cities were interviewed.
   Only eight of the cities were able to provide the number of
crack babies reported to the child welfare system. These eight
handled 8,974 such children during the previous year.
   The report estimated that hospital delivery, medical care and
foster care for these babies through age 5 would be about $500
million.
   The inspector general said the estimates for the eight cities,
along with adjustments for underreporting of crack babies, are
consistent with the president's National Drug Control Strategy
report estimate that 100,000 babies are born to cocaine-using women
each year.
   Prenatal exposure to cocaine can lead to premature birth, low
birthweight, birth defects and respiratory and neurological
problems, the report said. Some experts say that when these
children are older, many will have severe learning disabilities and
will need special education.
   Caseloads for child welfare workers in the 12 cities studied
averaged 49 children for foster care and 161 for protective
services, the report said.
   From 50 percent to 95 percent of the crack babies in the cities
studied went home with their mother or a relative. The rest go into
foster care or some other placement arrangement.
   The cities studied were: Chicago; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Los Angeles;
Miami; New York; Newark; Oakland, Calif.; Philadelphia; Phoenix;
San Francisco; Tacoma; and Washington, D.C.

   An Australian scientist who sees divine values
in nature and a Hindu lawyer who started communities for lepers in
India were named Wednesday as co-winners of the 1990 Templeton
Prize for progress in religion.
   The $580,000 prize, the largest in any field, went to
biologist-geneticist Charles K. Birch of Sydney and Murlidhar
Devidas Amte, who established five centers for lepers in the area
of Nagpur, India.
   The prize was founded in 1972 by financier John Templeton, a
Presbyterian, who keeps the amount higher than the Nobel Prizes in
the belief that religion is more important. An international panel
of judges picks the winners.
   Templeton urged more research into spiritual realities when he
named the winners at the Church Center for the United Nations.
   ``The accelerating discovery rate in natural sciences needs to
be matched by man's spiritual progress and discovery,'' he said.
``Much evidence has been found that God's ongoing creative process
is accelerating.''
   The prize winners reflected two aspects of religion _ its
intellectual ramifications in science and its altruistic impulse in
serving the weak.
   Birch, 71, a University of Sydney biologist from 1960 until his
recent retirement and veteran of science-religion conferences,
maintains that the interrelationship of nature, humanity and God
finds support in physics.
   He wrote that this has been emphasized by the ecological crisis,
which has shown the negative results of a mere mechanistic view of
nature. ``All actual entities have an inner reality as well as an
outer reality,'' Birch said.
   For example, he said, ``Nothing will save the whales ... unless
we attribute to whales intrinsic value in themselves and to God.''
   Birch, who has been a research fellow at several U.S.
universities, was cited for his ``reconciliation of the biological
and the religious understanding of creation.''
   Amte, 75, is called ``Baba,'' or ``father,'' by colleagues and
patients. His largest leper center covering 450 acres accommodates
1,400 lepers and includes a cottage hospital, library, cooperative
shops, bank, workshops, training schools, theaters, homes for aged
and infirm lepers and technical college with 7,500 students.
   Amte was born into a wealthy Brahmin family, educated at a
Christian college and became an attorney, but rebelled against
caste barriers to help untouchables set up cooperatives and unions.
   An experience resembling that of St. Francis initially turned
Amte to serving lepers, he said. He was so repelled at his first
encounter with one that he fled, then returned to befriend him.
   Amte, like his friend the late Mahatma Gandhi, extolled the
example of Christ but remained a Hindu.
   ``Everyone should attempt to walk in the shadow of the Cross,''
he wrote. ``That means you are in the company of that life which
scuttled itself to save others.''
   Australia's U.N. ambassador, Peter Wialenski, and India's, C.R.
Gharekan, attended the news conference with several religious and
public leaders.
   The prize is to be presented May 8 in London.
   Templeton said the prize ``is intended to help people see the
infinity'' of ways God acts in the world and reveals himself to
different cultures, adding, ``Exciting new advances are being made
in every religion.''
   Noting that millions are spent annually for research in natural
sciences, he said, ``Similar manpower and resources devoted to
research in spiritual subjects could lead to greater blessings for
mankind.''
   Previous winners of the prize include Mother Teresa of Calcutta,
evangelist Billy Graham, science philosopher Thomas Torrance of
Scotland and Russian exile writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

<HEAD>Education Secretary `Saddened' By Angry Texas Lawmakers</HEAD>

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said
Wednesday he was saddened by a confrontation with Texas lawmakers
whose fury erupted after he told them more money would not solve
the problems of Texas schools.
   Cavazos told a joint session of his home state Legislature in
Austin on Tuesday that fundamental changes _ not merely ``pitching
money'' _ were the answer to improving education.
   Three Hispanic legislators left the chamber during his speech.
Another confronted him afterward and then disrupted the secretary's
news conference to raise heated objections to his views.
   The Texas Legislature is under court order to reform a
school-financing system that short-changes poor districts. The
order resulted from a lawsuit brought by the predominantly Hispanic
Edgewood School District in San Antonio.
   Cavazos said it's the first time he has been attacked by fellow
Hispanic leaders since he became the first Hispanic Cabinet
appointee in September 1988.
   ``I wonder if they would have been as angry if the person who
delivered that address as secretary of education had not been
Hispanic,'' he said. ``It saddens me _ not because it was a
personal attack _ but because people I have so much respect for
take that kind of tactic, in front of television cameras and
reporters.
   ``What I got yesterday in Austin ... was people who felt the
solution was more dollars. It was quite a confrontation down there.
I was very disappointed that the whole issue had to be focused on
resources.''
   Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, interrupted the secretary's
news conference. ``I feel betrayed and I feel embarrassed that the
secretary of education _ a minority and from Texas _ would not take
a more aggressive position regarding the needs of education,''
Truan said Wednesday.
   Truan, chairman of the Hispanic Caucus in the Texas Senate, said
Cavazos is ``lacking in commitment to the children of our state and
of this country by the comments he made here yesterday, and I
regret that.''
   Al Kauffman, attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, said Cavazos' comments will not help those
working on behalf of the property-poor school districts.
   Kent Pogue, superintendent of the Kingsville Independent School
District, where Cavazos went to school, said he disagreed with
Cavazos' contention that more money is not needed for public
schools.
   ``By disagreeing, I'm not saying that money is the answer, but
money is needed to provide a quality education,'' said Pogue.
   Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican who has repeatedly vowed to
veto any new taxes for school finance reform, applauded Cavazos'
comments.
   ``He's a great educator, he's a great Texan, he's a fine guy,''
Clements said. ``I liked everything he had to say.''
   Cavazos said he has made the same speech dozens of times and
taken his message before several congressional committees, yet ``no
one has been angry with me until this came up the other day.''
   As examples of the fundamental changes he would like to see,
Cavazos said professionals should be able to teach with easier
certification, parents should have more choice of schools for their
children and principals and teachers should have more control over
the schools where they work.

   Spanish fishermen maintained a weeklong
blockade of four major southern ports on Wednesday to protest
Morocco's decision to increase fines for illegal fishing in its
waters, a government official said.
   They used their fishing craft to close the ports of Algeciras,
Puerto de Santa Maria, Almeria and Alicante, forcing a deep cut in
ferry service and stranding a total of 3,500 people on both sides
of the Strait of Gibraltar, said Alfonso Garrido, central
government representative in Andalusia region.
   He said the protest has led to clashes between police and
fishermen and to food and medicine shortages in Spain's North
African enclave of Ceuta. Garrido said it also caused a shortage of
fish and a steep increase in fish prices in southern Spain as well
as financial losses to ship owners.
   The blockade began last Thursday after Morocco announced it was
increasing maximum fines to more than $150,000 for infractions of
fishing regulations outlined in its 1988-92 fishing accord with the
European Economic Community.
   The fishermen also oppose the accord's obligatory
one-month-a-year ban on fishing to prevent overfishing of Moroccan
waters.
   An EEC commission agreed Wednesday to meet to discuss the issue.

<HEAD>107 Towns Support Referendum To Decrease Military Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURA GRIFFIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents in 107 of 141 towns across
Vermont voted to urge President Bush to cut military spending by 5
percent a year for the next five years, officials said Wednesday.
   ``This is a pioneer effort to bring a grass-roots message that
we want our spending priorities changed,'' said John Berkowitz,
organizer of the Sane-Freeze petition drive that got the referendum
on town meeting agendas.
   ``Vermont is a bellwether state in these issues, just like New
Hampshire is in presidential primaries,'' Berkowitz said at a news
conference to announce the referendum results.
   Of the 141 towns that held meetings Monday and Tuesday, 107
voted to press the federal government to redirect surplus defense
money to such programs as education, environmental protection,
housing and health care, he said.
   Ten towns shot down the referendum, and 11 more towns postponed
it indefinitely, Berkowitz said.
   In a few other towns _ including Chelsea, Dummerston and Hancock
_ residents amended the article. They supported the 5 percent
reduction until it ultimately reaches 50 percent, provided that all
the excess money go toward reducing the federal deficit.
   ``They felt that in solving that problem, it would solve many
others,'' Berkowitz said.
   ``President Bush's budget is totally out of sync with new
realities,'' he said. The proposed 5 percent drop in military
spending would be after inflation increases in the military budget
and would result in essentially level funding.
   He said Sane-Freeze, which was set up to push for nuclear arms
reductions, has expanded to become ``a national organization
working for peace and social justice and environmental issues.''
   The president's $1.25 trillion budget proposes $303 billion for
defense, including $10.4 billion for nuclear weapons.
Administration officials have said overall defense spending will
increase, but will not keep pace with inflation, leading to an
effective 2 percent reduction.
   ``The referendum was passed in urban and rural areas, by
Democrats and Republicans and young and old,'' said Rep. David
Larsen, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the House Education
Committee. ``This is not a partisan issue.''
   ``We have our priorities mixed up,'' said Rep. Toby Young, a
Democrat who is chairwoman of the state House Health and Welfare
Committee. ``Vermonters have seen that the federal priorities are
mixed up and have done something about it.''

   A battered woman who killed her husband
after he criticized her cooking was sentenced Wednesday to five
years in prison despite testimony that she suffered years of abuse.
   Virginia Eagan, 53, of Omro was convicted Jan. 31 of homicide by
negligent use of a weapon. Psychiatrists told jurors that Mrs.
Eagan suffered from an abuse-related emotional disturbance known as
battered wife syndrome.
   Winnebago County Circuit Judge William E. Crane said he imposed
the maximum sentence because ``battered women syndrome doesn't
warrant killing someone.''
   ``Virginia Eagan took a gun at close range while both of them
were drinking, and shot him through the heart and killed him,''
Crane said. ``People have to face up to responsibility.''
   Mrs. Eagan shot her husband of 32 years, Eugene Eagan, 56,
during a July 2 argument over boiled potatoes and beets at the
couple's rural town of Omro farm in east central Wisconsin.
   During the trial, both prosecution and defense attorneys
characterized Eagan, who was disabled and used a cane to walk, as
an abusive husband who would strike his wife with his canes and
beat her during drunken outbursts.
   Defense Attorney George Curtis said after sentencing that
sending Mrs. Eagan, a gray-haired factory worker who is going
blind, to prison was cruel and compounded the family's tragedy.
   ``I feel this lady has gone through hell and doesn't deserve
another minute of it. She was a helpless victim,'' Curtis said.
``I'm really sorry Virginia Eagan is going off to a new prison.''
   District Attorney Joseph Paulus said Eagan's death ``seems to
have fallen to the wayside in these proceedings.''
   ``The jury's verdict certainly did not excuse the defendant's
behavior,'' he said.
   Mrs. Eagan was originally charged with first-degree reckless
homicide, which carried a maximum 20-year prison sentence, but the
jury convicted her on the lesser charge, which carries a maximum
five-year penalty.

   A bipartisan panel called for flexible
spending limits on congressional campaigns Wednesday but did not
address many of the alleged abuses that have put the issue on the
front burner in Congress.
   The panel of experts sided with Democrats to support a voluntary
spending ceiling with discount TV and mail rates as an incentive
for compliance.
   But it rejected Democratic calls for public financing and
instead endorsed Republican desires to limit corporate and labor
political action committees, or PACs.
   GOP desires to loosen rules on indiviudal contributions, to
reduce a perceived advantage by incumbents and to make the
political parties the engine for raising and spending funds also
won the panel's endorsement.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine hailed the
panel's 41-page report as ``breakthrough recommendations'' for
untangling a bitterly partisan struggle.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas called it a
``potential breakthrough,'' saying the panel of six experts _ three
each picked by Dole and Mitchell _ at least ``touched on some of
the hot buttons.''
   Democrats, nonetheless, planned to push through the Senate Rules
Committee on Thursday their version of a bill that has both
spending caps and provisions for taxpayer financing.
   Mitchell acknowledged that the bill he is co-sponsoring with
Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has no
chance to get past a presidential veto, but he said it provides a
vehicle for negotiations between the parties.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said House Democrats
are nearing completion of a bill that would set a voluntary ceiling
of $550,000 on what a House candidate could spend. Democrats
previously had wanted a $400,000 ceiling.
   The task force called for ``reasonably high'' and flexible
voluntary spending ceilings reflecting the extra costs of running
in states where advertising in adjacent high-cost media markets is
required. But it would not count limited contribtions by in-state
residents to in-state candidates.
   The panel ignored many issues raised by the savings and loan
crisis.
   For example, it did not touch so-called leadership political
action committees or PACs, PACs run by members.
   It also had no recommendation on tax-exempt foundations. Of the
$1.3 million that Phoenix S&amp;L operator Charles H. Keating Jr.
contributed to five Senate candidates, $850,000 was through a
tax-exempt voter registration foundation headed by the son of Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   The panel called for prohibtions on the ``bundling'' or
gathering of many contributions by business and labor PACs but
endorsed as ``little obvious cause for concern'' such activities by
individuals.
   Keating, whose failed S&amp;L may cost the taxpayers $2 billion,
bundled more than $200,000 in individual contributions from members
of his family and business associates for the re-election campaigns
of the five senators.
   The five _ Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., and
Cranston _ are now under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee for interceding with regulators on behalf of Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   Recommendations by the task force include:
   _Giving parties authority to raise and spend unlimited amounts
on voter registration drives, phone banks, get-out-the-vote
campaigns and direct mail.
   _Raising the $25,000 limit an individual can make to a party
committee.
   _Providing a 100 percent tax credit, up to a specified amount,
for any indivual who contributes to a candidate in the
contributor's state.
   _A ``modest increase'' in the current $1,000 limit an individual
can contribute to one candidate and the $25,000 ceiling on all
contributions by an individual.
   _Reducing from $5,000 to $2,500 the contribution PACs can make
to a candidate for each of the primary and general elections, but
only after total PAC contributions reach one-third of the
candidate's spending limit.
   _Prohibiting PACs from making post-election contributions for
two years after an election to reduce a candidate's campaign debt.
   _Requiring radio and television stations to provide eight hours
of free time each year to candidates. Parties would allocate the
time.

<HEAD>British Group: Moscow Fails Conditions for Human Rights Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has failed to meet conditions
Britain set for attending a 1991 human rights conference in Moscow,
including those concerning Jewish emigration, a British group
reported Wednesday.
   The group of lawmakers, journalists and a student leader said
that despite progress on human rights, the Soviet Union has met
only one of the six conditions laid down by Britain _ freedom to
monitor human rights.
   ``We found evidence of real fear on the part of very many of the
Jews we met ... that there would be physically violent
manifestations of the anti-Semitism they find in their work, their
living environment,'' said legislator Paul Boateng, a member of the
opposition Labor Party.
   The eight-member group visited Moscow Feb. 23-26 on a trip
organized by Britain's Student and Academic Campaign for Soviet
Jews.
   The report was presented Wednesday evening to a meeting of about
750 members of the predominantly Jewish organization and was then
handed to a government representative.
   The British fact-finding team said human rights abuses continued
against Soviet Jews in the five other areas cited by Britain _
emigration, discrimination, freedom of religious and cultural
expression, prisoners of conscience and laws covering emigration
rights.
   The Soviet Union, which is eager to host the conference, has
received acceptances, some conditional, from most Western
countries. Britain announced its heavily qualified acceptance last
year.
   ``We should keep up the pressure,'' said Sir Anthony Kershaw,
ex-chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee,
another member of the group. ``Not until later should we decide on
1991.''
   Kershaw, of the governing Conservative Party, said that by
official count there are 1.2 million Jews in the Soviet Union, but
the number is probably 3 million to 4 million including people who
do not register.
   Last year 105,000 Soviet Jews left, he said, and about 2,000
have emigrated this year.
   Many are going to Israel as a second choice after the United
States tightened its entry visas when Moscow began allowing
significant numbers of Soviet Jews to leave.
   During its trip to Moscow, the British group met with Soviet
officials, representatives of refuseniks and Jewish organizations,
and Andrei Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner.
   Kershaw said the number of long-term refuseniks _ people who
applied a decade or more ago to leave _ dropped by 10,000 to 60,000
the past year.
   Those refused permission on grounds they have sensitive
information included a 76-year-old former professor of plant
breeding, said Kershaw. She retired 16 years ago and her family is
now in Israel, he said.
   ``The Jews of the Soviet Union have had a long and bitter
time,'' said lawmaker Sir Russell Johnston of the centrist Social
and Liberal Democratic Party. ``That time is not over, but ...
there is hope.''

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia celebrated on
Wednesday the 140th anniversary of the birth of its founding
father, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, in an outpouring of national pride
and gratitude for newly gained freedom.
   ``He was not only a man who did good for the state ... but he
was a man who breathed the idea of morality and truth into its
foundations,'' President Vaclav Havel said at a ceremony in
Hodonin, Masaryk's hometown 180 miles east of Prague.
   Masaryk and Gen. Milan Stefanik, a Slovak hero, gained U.S.
President Woodrow Wilson's support to realize their dream of
independent Czechoslovakia in 1918.
   Masaryk was erased from history books first by the Nazis and
then by the Communists after they took power in 1948. He was
depicted as a bourgeois capitalist who meant little for
Czechoslovakia.
   In the face of police harassment, Havel and other dissidents
supported Masaryk's image as the founder of independent and free
Czechoslovakia during the years of harsh Communist rule that ended
with last year's revolution.
   The Communists despised Masaryk not only as a symbol of
pre-World War II democracy, but for being an intellectual beloved
by Czechoslovaks and respected worldwide.
   Masaryk, a philosopher by profession, entered politics in his
60s. He was a strong advocate of the unity of Czechs and Slovaks,
the country's two main ethnic groups.
   ``Just now, in the times of new programs, and perspectives, let
us remember Masaryk striving for silent, practical and active inner
qualities, proceeding from words to deeds,'' Petr Pithart, the
prime minister of the Czech lands, said at a parallel ceremony in
Prague, the official CTK news agency reported.
   Celebrations of Masaryk's anniversary were held throughout the
country.
   Earlier, Havel and Czechoslovak Prime Minister Marian Calfa laid
wreaths at the Masaryk grave in Lany, 30 miles west of Prague.

   Prime Minister Michael Manley on
Wednesday said his party's landslide victory in local elections was
a mandate for his government, which has faced growing attacks for
its austerity program.
   In Tuesday's vote, Manley's left-of-center governing party
defeated the opposition led by former premier Edward Seaga, a
conservative and staunch U.S. ally. The balloting was marred by a
low turnout and isolated beatings, shootings and ballot thefts.
   Election results released late Tuesday night indicated Manley's
People's National Party kept its hold on 11 of the 12 parish
councils and the Kingston-St. Andrew metropolitan area.
   Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party retained its St. Thomas parish
council.
   Local elections are seen here as a gauge of the government's
popularity. Manley said his party's victory meant Jamaicans
recognized ``that we are grappling with the problems.''
   His popularity recently dropped after the government enforced
the austerity measures to rescue the debt-ridden economy. The moves
included an increase in food prices and higher taxes.
   During Tuesday's vote in downtown Kingston, policemen shot in
the air to disperse a crowd that threatened Seaga, threw ink in his
face, and punctured his car tires.
   In the capital, police said one unidentified voter was shot to
death and another remained in serious condition after he was
stabbed by several men.
   Witnesses and state radio said thugs beat up a polling station
chairwoman in Kingston and reported several cases of hoodlums and
gunmen stealing ballot boxes.
   However, voting was mostly peaceful in the countryside. The
government deployed 6,500 police and 4,000 soldiers to prevent
violence in the Caribbean island, where elections have often been
marred by violence.
   With most votes counted, the governing party had won 109 of the
187 seats being contested in the 12 parish councils, with the
opposition receiving 38 seats and independents winning the rest.
   In one of the lowest voter turnouts in Jamaican history, only 45
percent of the electorate went to the polls.
   Manley's party trounced Seaga's in a national parliamentary
election in February 1989.
   ``The shine is still on the ball as far as the PNP is
concerned,'' Seaga said of Manley's party after the latest vote.
``As time wears on, the ball is not going to have the shine any
longer.''

   The Bush administration said Wednesday it is
flexible about the timing of a superpower summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and is willing to move up the
meeting from late June.
   ``We're always willing to change,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We can do it anytime.''
   President Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to hold the summit the
last two weeks of June, probably in Washington. That would put it
right before a seven-nation summit of Western allies Bush is to
host in Houston July 9 to 11.
   ``We'd like to do it as early as possible because of the
economic summit,'' Fitzwater said of the next Bush-Gorbachev
meeting. The Soviets also may have a desire to meet earlier because
of a major Communist Party meeting now scheduled for late June or
early July.
   Gorbachev has ``agreed in principle'' to be a commencement
speaker at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and those
ceremonies are scheduled for May 28. Some officials think it is
unlikely he would make two trips to the United States in such a
short period.
   Moreover, there has been speculation that some of the
Bush-Gorbachev meetings would be at the president's vacation home
in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush is tentatively scheduled to be in
Kennebunkport from May 25 to 28.
   Fitzwater said he was certain that if Gorbachev speaks at Brown
``it would be associated with the summit in some fashion.''
   To prepare for the summit, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze will hold his next round of talks with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III in Washington April 4-6, U.S. officials
said.
   Baker went to Moscow last month to see Gorbachev and
Shevardnadze. The trip produced a narrowing of differences on a
strategic arms reduction treaty the two leaders would like to sign
at the summit.
   The two sides also moved closer on provisions for agreements
being negotiated also with other nations to ban chemical weapons
production and to reduce troops, tanks and nother non-nuclear arms
in Europe.
   Baker also is in the midst of making arrangements for a meeting
with the 15 NATO foreign ministers, probably in Brussels, after
Shevardnadze visits next month, officials said Wednesday.
   This is in addition to a meeting Baker will hold with the NATO
ministers in Ayreshire, Scotland, June 7-9. The new session, which
has not been announced, was disclosed by the officials on condition
of anonymity.
   Baker has held five rounds of talks with Shevardnadze so far _
in Vienna last March, in Moscow in May, in Paris in July, in
Jackson, Wyo., in September, and in Moscow Feb. 7-10. They also
could meet in Namibia while attending ceremonies marking the new
African country's independence from South African rule Feb. 21.
   Baker's schedule reflects stepped up efforts to hasten arms
control agreements, lend U.S. support to political and economic
reforms in the Soviet Bloc and consult NATO allies more on
U.S-Soviet relations.
   Also, Baker has pledged to consult regularly with the West
Europeans about German unification. The U.S. formula gives special
roles to Britain and France, as well as the Soviet Union, as the
Big Four allies of World War II.
   A number of smaller countries, however, feel left out. Many are
victims of German aggression in World War II and some are worried
about the situation in Europe after West Germany merges with East
Germany.
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti carried these concerns
to President Bush and to Baker on Tuesday. It was then decided to
have Baker meet with the foreign ministers after Shevardnadze's
visit.

<HEAD>Karpov, Timman Start Battle to Decide Kasparov's Challenger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov faces
only one obstacle _ Jan Timman of the Netherlands _ on Karpov's
comeback path to a rematch this fall with the game's other king,
fellow Soviet Garri Kasparov.
   Timman, the third-ranking player in the world, takes on Karpov
beginning Thursday.
   Their 12-game contest in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, is
scheduled to end April 4. The winner gains the right to play the
26-year-old Soviet titleholder in a 24-game marathon in the fall.
   Karpov, 38, world champion for 10 years before losing to
Kasparov in 1985, is strongly favored to win and challenge Kasparov
for a record-breaking fifth time in a title bout.
   Timman's supporters are hoping he can exploit Karpov's
relatively poor form over the last year and pull off an upset.
   ``Of course Karpov is the favorite, but if Timman is in good
condition, the situation is unclear,'' said Kasparov, speaking by
telephone from Spain.
   If both players are nervous or off their form, then Karpov will
win, the champion said. ``But if Timman plays well, he could
produce some surprises.''
   Kasparov said he might enjoy facing a new opponent, but there
were also advantages in taking on his archrival again. ``It would
give me a chance to beat Karpov convincingly.'' he said.
   Timman, 38, is a celebrity at home. He frequently appears on
Dutch talk shows and has appeared in a television commercial as
well.
   The prize fund of $450,000 at the World Chess Championship
Candidates' Final in Malaysia will be split, with five-eights going
to the winner.
   However, a West German computer company is offering a prize of
$1.5 million to the first Westerner to challenge Kasparov.
   ``Most Dutch writers have been saying Timman will be destroyed
by Karpov,'' said Kik Shouten, an editor at the Dutch magazine
``New in Chess.''
   ``But one or two commentators say Timman has some chances
because of Karpov's recent form.''
   In recent years, Kasparov and Karpov have dominated world chess.
But in a January world ranking, Kasparov established a crushing
lead, while Timman closed on Karpov.
   In a competition last June, Karpov lost his last three games,
allowing Timman to slip into first place. Karpov had never before
lost three in a row in an international career stretching 20 years.
   Karpov defeated his heavily outranked Soviet compatriot, Artur
Yusupov, 4.5-3.5 after winning the eighth and final game in the
Candidates' semifinal in October. But Karpov almost fell behind in
the sixth game.
   And in January, Karpov finished third behind two Soviet
grandmasters in a competition in Italy.
   ``If Timman ever had any chances to beat Karpov, he has them
now,'' said Dutch chess historian Rob Verhoeven.
   But British Grandmaster Raymond Keene pointed to Karpov's
overwhelming superiority over Timman in their past encounters.
   According to Keene, Karpov has defeated Timman 14 times and lost
three with 27 games drawn. He said Timman hasn't beaten Karpov
since 1980.
   The details of the showdown with Kasparov are not yet clear.
   The International Chess Federation has awarded the title duel to
Lyon, France.
   However, Ted Field, a Los Angeles businessman and film producer,
said he wants to stage the final in a leading American city.
Kasparov has indicated a strong preference for holding at least
half the contest in the United States, most likely New York.

<TEXT>
   The former Afghan defense minister
who led a coup attempt defected Wednesday to the Moslem guerrillas
he fought for more than a decade, sources said.
   Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai fled Afghanistan on Wednesday with his
wife, two daughters and son, then returned with the U.S.-backed
insurgents, according to rebel and Pakistani government sources.
   President Najib again claimed that the coup Tanai launched
Tuesday had ``absolutely been broken. Of that there is no doubt.''
   Tanai's flight seemed to indicate this, but Western diplomats
and guerrilla leaders based in Pakistan said fighting continued,
although on a smaller scale.
   In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly told a
congressional panel that the fighting had spread from Kabul, the
capital, to the towns of Jalalabad, Kandahar and Kost.
   Western diplomats and guerrilla leaders in Pakistan, all of whom
spoke on condition of anonymity, also said they had reports of
fighting in Kandahar and in the city of Herat.
   Rival factions in the Afghan forces were reported battling for
control of Bagram, the country's largest air base.
   Guerrilla sources and Western diplomats in Islamabad said
Tanai's forces had won control of the base. Najib ordered warplanes
to bomb it, and several Soviet-supplied Scud missiles were also
fired, they said.
   ``Bagram is completely destroyed,'' said one guerrilla source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Afghanistan's charge d'affaires in Pakistan, Qudratullah Ahmadi,
denied the base had fallen to the mutineers, who had the support of
the Moslem guerrillas.
   The diplomats and rebel sources also told of sporadic street
fighting in Kabul.
   Najib said ``a number of people,'' mostly civilians, had been
killed or injured during nearly 20 hours of fighting. He gave no
specific figures, but guerrilla sources said there were hundreds of
casualties.
   Before the coup began, Najib said Tanai, who had been defense
minister, threw away his identification card from the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and his military uniform.
Tanai escaped with ``valuable government documents,'' Najib said.
   Tanai, a battle-hardened soldier popular with the rank-and-file
military, has been accused of engineering three coup attempts
against Najib's government. Guerrilla sources said Tanai contacted
guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar before leaving Afghanistan and
that one of Hekmatyar's commanders had been with Tanai since the
coup attempt was launched.
   Such an alliance would be more one of convenience than ideology.
Tanai, a Marxist hard-liner, has long advocated a harsh stance
against the U.S.-backed guerrillas and opposed Najib's methods of
dealing with the war and his peace efforts.
   At the same time, the radical fundamentalist Hekmatyar has
become increasingly estranged from his fellow Moslem guerrilla
leaders, rejecting their political leadership and executing some of
their followers.
   The latest bid to bring down Najib's government began Tuesday
afternoon when Afghan air force planes bombed the presidential
palace in the heart of Kabul and widespread fighting was reported
in the capital.
   On Wednesday afternoon, Tanai boarded a military helicopter that
flew flanked by two fighter jets to a military base in northern
Pakistan, guerrilla sources said.
   After landing, they said, Tanai talked with several guerrillas
engaged in the 11-year war against the Afghan government.
   ``Later, he returned with them to a point deeper in Afghanistan
to continue the struggle against Najib,'' said Foreign Secretary
Tamveer Ahmed of Pakistan.
   A Soviet-made transport plane carrying 12 people, including
three Afghan brigadier generals, also landed Wednesday near the
border town of Parachinar, government and guerrilla sources said.
   Among the generals was Gen. Abdul Qadar Akka, a former air
defense commander who was implicated with Tanai in a coup attempt
in December. Neither officer was ever charged, they said. The
identities of the other two generals were not disclosed.
   Radio Kabul accused another high-ranking party member, Asadullah
Sarwari, of involvement in the coup plot. Sarwari was a former
interior minister accused of hundreds of killings following the
1978 revolution that installed a Communist government and sparked
the civil war.
   The Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan in
February 1989 after nine years of direct military intervention but
continue to ship billions of dollars in arms to the Afghan armed
forces.
   The United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia support the
guerrillas.
   Although one of the most anti-Western of the seven guerrilla
groups, most of the U.S. weapons have gone to Hekmatyar's
Hebz-i-Islami, or Party of Islam.
   Tanai belonged to a faction of the ruling party that is a bitter
rival of Najib. He had opposed Najib's peace overtures to the
guerrillas to try to end the civil war, which has claimed more than
1 million lives, destroyed tens of thousands of villages and ruined
the country's economy.
   Since the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Najib's troops
have held their ground against the insurgents, but guerrilla
leaders in Pakistan and army officers in Afghanistan have said at
least seven other plots to overthrow Najib have been uncovered.

<HEAD>Woman Launches Appeal for Romanian Orphans, AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former government worker began a campaign
Wednesday to raise $16.4 million for Romania's orphans and children
with AIDS.
   Romanian health authorities say their country is suffering from
the first known epidemic of childhood AIDS from infected blood
transfusions and repeated use of contaminated needles.
   Mary Gibson, an aide to former Defense Secretary George Younger,
said the new Romanian Orphanage Trust hopes to pay for more staff
for each of Romania's 64 orphanages.
   About $165,000 already has been raised following Mrs. Gibson's
appearance on a British Broadcasting Corp. television program.
   She told a news conference Wednesday she was so stunned by
television pictures after the Romanian revolution in December that
she decided to visit Romania and its orphanages.
   ``I was appalled by what I found,'' she said. ``These children
are not loved. Nobody has time to talk to them, hold their hands or
cuddle them. Very often they are kept naked as this is the only way
to keep them clean.''
   Mrs. Gibson said play group leaders, nurses and helpers for each
orphanage were needed, along with thousands of diapers, blankets,
educational toys, dried milk, mattresses, vitamins, medical
equipment and drugs. Medical teams to visit the children regularly
are also needed, she said.
   Three members of the trust left for Bucharest on Wednesday to
assess the immediate needs of the orphans and children suffering
from AIDS.
   In a separate appeal, theatrical producer Thelma Holt said
British theaters should donate a night's take to help Romanian
children with AIDS.
   ``Babies are dying, and they don't have simple things like
disposable nappies (diapers) or syringes. It is just awful,'' said
Miss Holt, who just returned from Bucharest.
   The producer said she hoped to donate one night's box office
take from Chekhov's ``The Three Sisters,'' which she will produce
in London later this year.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, breaks down the
body's immune system. There is no known cure.
   Romanian health officials said in February there were 50
confirmed AIDS cases in children. However, other reports have
suggested there are many more.

   Three suspected IRA members wanted in West Germany
in a bombing that killed a British military officer will be
extradited to stand trial, a French appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The extradition of Patrick Murray, 45, Donagh O'Kane, 29, and
Pauline Drumm, 23, will be the first from France under an
anti-terrorism convention passed by the European Community in 1977,
the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported. France
ratified the convention last year.
   AFP said West Germany charged the three with assassination,
destruction by explosives, criminal association and arms violations
in warrants issued Sept. 13.
   Authorities believe they were involved in attacks against
British military targets in West Germany as members of the Irish
Republican Army.
   Among the attacks was a car bombing last July 2 in Hanover that
killed a British soldier and injured his wife and three children.
   French counterespionage agents arrested Drumm, Murray and O'Kane
two weeks later, AFP said.
   The IRA has waged a campaign to force the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

   Four-time winner Rick Swenson regained
the lead Wednesday in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, while a
musher miles behind him was trying to scare off curious buffaloes.
   Lavon Barve and three-time champion Susan Butcher were minutes
behind Swenson about a third of the way through the 1,158-mile race
from Anchorage to Nome.
   ``There's a lot of strong teams this year,'' said Butcher,
warning that there's still plenty of time for surprises. ``We've
got a long way to go yet.''
   Swenson led the race Monday topping the Alaska Range at
3,500-foot Rainy Pass, but was overtaken by defending champion Joe
Runyan at Rohn on Tuesday.
   He had a cut on his face and a cracked plastic runner on his
sled as he mushed away from this Athabascan Indian village of 110
people at Iditarod milepost 367.
   Swenson said the damage wouldn't stop him from reaching McGrath,
the next checkpoint 48 miles from here, where he either would
repair the runner or change sleds.
   Behind Swenson on the trail through Farewell Burn, eighth-place
racer Tim Osmar of Clam Gulch fired shots into the air to clear the
trail of several buffaloes.
   The Iditarod Trail is named for a tiny ghost town it passes
through. The race commemorates the 1925 emergency delivery by relay
dog teams of life-saving diphtheria serum to Nome.
   Butcher won the race in 1986, 1987 and 1988 and took second
place last year. Swenson won in 1977, 1979, 1981 and 1982. He has
finished in the top 10 every year since 1973, when the Iditarod was
started.

<TEXT>
   Booby traps and leaks forced South
Korean and U.S. teams to stop searching a border tunnel dug by the
Communist North as a possible invasion route, military officials
said Wednesday.
   At least 10 booby traps have been dismantled since a dog working
with inspection teams was killed Sunday when it apparently set off
an explosion, officials said. No soldier has been injured.
   The teams were draining the shaft of water after plugging it
with sandbags for protection, Defense Ministry officials said
Wednesday.
   The tunnel was drilled open Saturday through an intercept tunnel
from the southern sector of the Demilitarized Zone separating the
capitalist south from North Korean.
   It was the fourth tunnel discovered since 1974 beneath the zone,
but North Korea has denied digging any tunnels.
   An American officer and a South Korean soldier searching the
first tunnel discovered in 1974 were reportedly killed, as were 10
others in 1975 and 1978 while searching two other tunnels.
   South Korean officials believe North Korea dug more than 20
border passages under the heavily fortified border to allow
commando units to bypass South Korea's frontline soldiers in the
event of an invasion.
   A military report, presented Tuesday to a National Assembly
committee, said about 250 U.S. specialists are working to help
discover other tunnels.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of congressmen protested Wednesday the
Army's decision to retroactively revoke an ROTC scholarship given
to a star recruit who later admitted he is gay.
   In a letter to Brig. Gen. Charles R. Hansell, head of the ROTC
second regional command at Fort Knox, Ky., 23 members asked the
Army to abandon its attempt to recover $25,000 in scholarship money
given to James M. Holobaugh.
   The Army was set to award a commission last May when Holobaugh,
24, at member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps at Washington
University in St. Louis, disclosed his homosexuality.
   After a preliminary hearing in December, a hearing officer
recommended in January that the Army order Holobaugh to repay the
four-year scholarship.
   ``We believe that to compel him to repay this money would not
only be fundamentally unfair; it would also reflect an appalling
mean-spiritedness which has no place in the ROTC,'' the lawmakers
said in a two-page letter.
   There was no answer at Hansell's office early Wednesday evening.
Last week, Lt. Col. John Calvin Blake, an Army ROTC spokesman, said
the case was probably the first of its kind.
   ``The investigation is still ongoing and whatever the hearing
officer recommended has to go through a careful review before there
is a final decision,'' Blake said.
   The Pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military
service. The U.S. Supreme Court recently dealt opponents of that
policy a blow by refusing to hear two appeals of the Pentagon
policy.
   U.S. Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who is gay, drafted the letter.
Most of the signers were Democrats although two Republicans, Reps.
Bill Green of New York and Christopher Shays of Connecticut, also
signed. Another who signed the letter was Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., the only other member of Congress who has publicly stated
he is gay.
   ``Throughout his career as a cadet, Mr. Holobaugh has compiled
an enviable record of performance, with ROTC evaluations describing
him as `possessing outstanding leadership potential,' the letter
said.
   The legislators also noted that the Army had held Holobaugh up
``as a public model of excellence'' in ROTC recruitment
advertisements.
   Holobaugh, who expects to graduate in the spring, said he was
dating women when he began college in 1984 and that it wasn't until
late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was homosexual.

   A man reportedly identified by
IRA supporters as a member of the group's political wing Sinn Fein
was slain by a gunman in a Belfast suburb Wednesday night.
   Belfast police headquarters did not immediately identify the man
but said he had just left a police base in Lurgan, where he had
reported as a condition for bail, when a man in a car opened fire.
   Police said the car believed to have been used by the gunman was
later found on fire on a road near Lurgan, 20 miles southwest of
Belfast.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted
unidentified IRA supporters as saying the slain man was Sam
Marshall, 31, who was out on bail on a charge of illegal possession
of ammunition.
   The news agency quoted the supporters as saying Marshall had
been warned by police in recent days that he was on a Protestant
paramilitary hit list.
   Press Association said that in the 1980s Marshall served a
lengthy prison term for illegal possession of firearms.
   The IRA supporters said Marshall was a member of Sinn Fein, a
legal group.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
The mainly Roman Catholic group wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule. The republic is 95 percent Catholic.

   Coast Guard crews fought to contain more
than 100,000 gallons of fuel oil spreading Wednesday from a barge
that exploded and burned in a busy waterway between New Jersey and
New York City's Staten Island.
   Investigators speculated that Tuesday's blast may have been
caused by either static electricity, machinery sparks or friction
between the barge and a tug towing it away from a Citgo Petroleum
Corp. docks in Linden.
   Two explosions ripped through the barge Cibro Savannah within 15
minutes, cracking the vessel and spilling part of its 4.2
million-gallon cargo into the Arthur Kill waterway. One person, the
captain, was injured.
   It was the third time in a week crews had to place containment
booms around a vessel to prevent further pollution in the shipping
channel, which connects through the Kill Van Kull to New York Habor.
   ``We're looking for ignition sources, anything that could have
caused a spark,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jay Hess, the senior
investigating officer.
   The explosions left two gaping holes in the center of the
400-foot, 8,150-ton barge, which is owned by Cirillo Brothers
Petroleum Corp. of New York.
   Capt. Robert North, the Coast Guard's officer in charge of New
York-area waters, said part of a four-mile slick reached open
waters but most of it had been contained by booms around the barge.
   Carol Ash, commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, said containment booms still in place
after smaller spills last week prevented Tuesday's slick from
reaching Prall's Island, a wildlife refuge in the Arthur Kill where
migratory birds and marine life spawn.
   Ms. Ash said workers found one oil-soaked seabird and attempts
were being made to save it.
   ``I'm getting a bit tired of coming out to these things,'' New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio told reporters at the Citgo docks. ``The law
is either not being complied with, or, if it is being complied
with, it is not sufficient.''
   The Arthur Kill was the site of a 567,000-gallon oil spill on
Jan. 1-2 from a ruptured Exxon underwater pipeline.
   Last Thursday, 3,500 gallons of heavy crude spilled from a barge
into the Arthur Kill at Exxon's refinery in Linden, a day after
30,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the Kill Van Kull from a
barge anchored in Bayonne.

   The Justice Department has no objections to
the planned purchase of Latin American routes by American Airlines
from Eastern Airlines, the department said Wednesday.
   The proposed $471 million transaction still must be approved by
the Transportation Department and the bankruptcy court in New York
overseeing the reorganization of Eastern.
   Completion of the route sale is a necessary condition for final
approval of a reorganization agreement between Eastern and its
unsecured creditors. Under that accord the unsecured creditors, who
are owed $980 million by Eastern, would receive about $490 million
in cash and notes.
   Joe Krovisky, spokesman for the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said the division informed the two companies and the
Transportation Department that its review of potential antitrust
ramifications of the sale had yielded no reason to object.
   Pan American has filed objections to the route transfer with the
Transportation Department, arguing that it would eventually make
American the dominant airline in Miami. Pan Am asked for a public
hearing on the issue.
   Eastern and American have until March 13 to file replies to Pan
Am's objections. Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris said
a decision on the sale probably would be made in three or four
weeks.
   Under the proposal, American, the nation's largest airline,
would take over Eastern's routes to Ecuador, Peru, Colombia,
Bolivia, Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Paraguay.
   Pan Am told the Transportation Department that it, rather than
American, should be awarded service from Miami to Guayaquil and
Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia.
   Included in the transfer would be Eastern's Miami-Toronto route,
which Pan Am said it should be awarded.
   If Eastern sheds the routes, it would be about two-thirds its
present size.

   A gas explosion and a fire killed
11 people and injured six Wednesday night in an Asian restaurant in
downtown Frankfurt, officials said.
   Fire brigade chief Guenter Burbaum, who gave the casualty
figures, told reporters at the scene the blaze broke out about 8:40
p.m. (2:40 p.m. EST) and gutted the Koryo Chinese-Korean restaurant
on the second floor of a five-story building near Frankfurt's
Cathedral.
   Police spokesman Kurt Kraus said a gas leak in the kitchen
apparently caused the blast, but that experts were still
investigating.
   ``The explosion probably occurred in the kitchen,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Kraus said four victims were in serious condition. He said among
the injured were diners who leaped from windows to escape the
flames.
   He could not say if any foreigners were among the victims, which
included five men, five women and a child.
   ``We have not identified anyone. The identification of victims
will take at least until tomorrow,'' Kraus said. ``At the moment,
we have no idea about their nationalities.''
   Rescuers said two of the injured were in critical condition.
   ``I heard a loud noise and I looked out of my window. All I saw
was black smoke and a woman hanging from the window who appeared to
be dead,'' said Wilhelm Sehrt, who lives across the street.
   ``I also saw a girl, about seven or eight years old, lying on
the street, bleeding. I don't know what happened to her. I also
heard people screaming, `Fire, fire!'''
   Witnesses saw the body of a man covering that of a young child.
   Kraus said authorities were trying to determine how many people
were in the restaurant at the time of the blast.
   Police said most of the victims appeared to be restaurant guests.
   Burbaum said the explosion apparently preceded the fire.
   The blaze was extinguished less than an hour after it broke out.
   No other buildings in the area suffered damage.

<HEAD>Occhetto Urges Italy's Communist to Unite Behind New Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of Italy's Communist Party late
Wednesday urged members to support radical changes in the party in
hopes of uniting the nation's fractured left.
   Achille Occhetto spoke at an extraordinary congress that will
decide on his proposal, which could lead to the rebirth of the
party _ with a new name and without its hammer and sickle symbol.
   ``The problems facing communism not only affect the countries of
Eastern Europe but also our very own country,'' Occhetto said.
   Occhetto, secretary of the West's largest Communist Party,
stunned other party leaders in November when, three days after the
opening of the Berlin Wall, he called for overhauling the party in
line with reforms sweeping the East bloc.
   The party's Central Committee endorsed Occhetto's proposal but
called for an extraordinary congress to decide the issue.
   About 67 percent of the 1,092 delegates are loyal to Occhetto,
more than enough to assure the success of his proposal in voting on
Saturday.
   The proposal has been opposed by members of the Old Guard, which
wants much more limited reforms.
   Longtime members argue that the party can be proud of its
traditions. They also say the party has criticized abuses by
Soviet-bloc governments and should not panic and endorse dramatic
changes just because communism has collapsed in Eastern Europe.
   Italian Communists have long proclaimed their independence from
Moscow, pledged their support for Western parliamentary democracy,
suppprted Italy's membership in NATO and criticised Moscow's
interventions in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Afghanistan in 1979.
   The Communists have been kept out of power for 45 years. But
Occhetto said Wednesday night that a new party could help forge
socialist unity in Italy, bring the country's fractured left under
a single umbrella and pose an alternative to the Christian
Democrats, who have dominated or led every post-war government.
   He said the Communists can move closer to the Greens, Radicals
and liberal Catholics within the Christian Democrats.
   The Socialists, Italy's third-largest party after Christian
Democrats and the Communists, have been coalition partners with the
Christian Democrats in the last decade. They also hope to surpass
the Communists in the polls and become the de facto leader of the
Italian left.
   Over the last 20 years, Italian Communists have seen a steady
decline both in membership, now about 1.4 million, and in their
strength at the polls.

   Three of Australia's top beaches were
closed Wednesday after a 2{-mile oil slick swept ashore in Sydney.
   The Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte beaches were closed by Waverley
Council inspectors, dead sea birds and fish washed ashore after
being caught up in the thick oil, which started staining the sands
late Tuesday.
   The New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission began an
inquiry Wednesday into the cause of the spill, which a spokesman
said was believed to come from a passing ship.
   Bondi, six miles east of the city, is one of Sydney's leading
tourists attractions and famed for its scantily-clad sunbathers.

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission agreed Wednesday
to begin a special investigation into allegations of abuses in
Haiti and to continue monitoring the situations in Iran and El
Salvador.
   In recognition of recent democratic elections in Chile, the
43-nation commission agreed to drop Chile from the countries
meriting close attention because of consistent and gross violations.
   The commission voted not to act on a mildly worded resolution
that would have secured an official role for the United Nations in
a planned visit by human rights experts to Iraq.
   Iraq was cited last month for its ``abyssmal'' human rights
record in a U.S. State Department report.
   The commission adopted without a vote a resolution sponsored by
France and Peru to appoint a special investigator on Haiti, saying
the situation under Gen. Prosper Avril ``remains disturbing and
even seems to have deteriorated since July 1989.''
   It said it was ``alarmed by the proliferation of acts of
violence in Haiti, particularly against arrested or detained
persons, and by the apparent inability of the judicial system to
put an end to such acts.''
   The commission is the United Nations' highest human rights body.
It said in agreeing to continue the annual investigation into the
El Salvador situation, started in 1981, that it was concerned at
the spiral of abuses committed by both extreme right-wing death
squads and leftist rebels.
   A resolution voiced ``deep concern at the continued
unsatisfactory capacity of the judicial system'' to track down
those responsible for violations.
   The commission also agreed by consensus to continue its
investigation on Iran, expressing concern at complaints of unlawful
executions and torture cited in a recent report by U.N. expert
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl.
   It welcomed Tehran's ``favorable reception'' to suggestions by
Galindo Pohl after his brief visit to Iran in January, the first by
a U.N. investigator.
   The Salvadoran lawyer will make a second trip there, at Iran's
invitation, prior to his report to the commission's 1991 session.
   Galindo Pohl's recommendations included one that the
International Committee of the Red Cross be allowed to visit
prisoners throughout Iran.
   The mildness of the resolution drew fire from the United States.
   ``We regret how little evidence there is that Iran has sought to
moderate its grave human rights violations,'' said U.S.
representative Beverly Zweiben.
   ``Summary executions of prisoners continue as does imprisonment
for political purposes.''
   Iranian Ambassador Sirous Nasseri attacked the U.S. stand as
``arrogance.'' In the only vote of the day, the commission voted
18-14 to take no action on a Western-backed proposal that the
Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities report back to the commission, its parent body, on a
planned visit to Iraq.
   The proposal said the United Nations should sponsor the visit.
   The decision means the subcommission's 26 legal experts will be
free to visit Iraq as individuals, but will be bound to report back
to the commission.
   The commission agreed without a vote that no further need
existed for a special U.N. investigator on Chile now that the
recently elected government of Patricio Alywin promised restoration
of human rights.
   Under the military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile joined
South Africa and Israel in being regularly criticized for grave
human rights violations at the commission's annual session.
   The six-week meeting ends Friday.

<TEXT>
   Premier Hans Modrow said Wednesday that East
Germans are ready to sign a border treaty with Poland, and he
criticized West Germany for trying impose a hasty unity plan on his
people.
   The Communist premier and other top East German officials have
lately displayed irritation with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and the fast pace of unification sought by their Western neighbor.
   In Bonn, opposition Social Democrats, who also charge that Kohl
is pushing too hard for a speedy unification, insisted on a
Germany-wide referendum over the issue.
   Modrow's concerns over unification echoed those of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who on Tuesday urged a slow and
careful approach and said NATO membership for a united Germany was
``out of the question.''
   At the last parliamentary session before East Germans go to the
polls on March 18, Modrow sought to assure Poland that his nation
lays no claim to German lands forfeited after the Nazi defeat in
1945.
   About one third of modern-day Poland was German land under the
Third Reich.
   Kohl has been ``evasive and ambiguous'' in statements on the
border, Modrow said.
   Kohl on Tuesday agreed to support a West German parliamentary
declaration of respect for the current border, but did not make
clear whether he thought the two Germanys could jointly recognize
the border before they are reunited.
   In Washington, the White House on Wednesday praised Kohl's
latest stand as a positive and important step. ``As the president
has made clear, the U.S. recognizes the current German-Polish
border,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The premier said he and Kohl had received a letter signed by 32
U.S. senators calling on both German states to negotiate separate
border treaties with Poland into one single accord.
   ``East Germany is prepared to do this immediately,'' Modrow said.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein repeated that Bonn
would begin negotiations on such an accord only after the East
German elections seat a new government.
   Modrow said an accord recognizing the Oder and Neisse rivers as
the permanent border could be negotiated by the two Germanys. The
accord could be ratified immediately after unification, he said.
   Kohl and the Social Democrats differ not only on the pace of
unification but on the means.
   The Social Democrats have sought unification through creation of
a new constitution by the German people. The chancellor has said he
favors unification under a section of the constitution permitting
individual East German states to decide for themselves whether to
join their western neighbor.
   Such a procedure would likely be the quickest route.
   On the issue of a unified Germany's role in NATO, the Social
Democrats said the organization and the Warsaw Pact should at some
point be replaced by ``a European security system'' including the
Soviet Union, the United States and Canada.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday Britain
believed strongly that a united Germany should remain in NATO. ``It
would be sensible for the stability of Europe,'' he said, answering
questions in the House of Commons.
   Modrow also criticized central bankers with the West German
Bundesbank for leaking details of a working paper on how the two
Germanys could merge economically.
   Der Spiegel magazine and other media have reported what they
described as a secret agreement among financial officials from both
nations to make the West German mark legal tender in both states
and to exchange much of the $10 billion in East German savings
accounts at a one-to-one rate.
   Reports of a pre-arranged monetary union have been denied by
officials in both Germanys, who contend no decisions will be made
before the East German election.
   But the rumors have hurt the West German mark's value on
international markets, prompting some fearful East Germans to
withdraw their savings, and have inflated the exchange rate for
non-convertible East marks among black-market traders.
   ``It must be clearly said which side is pushing for excessive
haste and spreading rumors,'' Modrow told Parliament. ``It's clear
a monetary union can't be built in a day. It must be thoroughly
prepared.''
   He said speculation stirred by the monetary union leaks are
further damaging East Germany's economy.
   The Social Democrats, trying to woo citizens of both nations as
the unification process continues, also proposed immediate measures
for the ``social security'' of East Germans who could face
hardships as their nation undergoes major economic changes.
   Parliament Speaker Guenther Maleuda also lashed out at West
German politicians for interfering in the East German election
campaign.
   Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and former
Chancellor Willy Brandt are among those public figures who appear
to be using the East German campaign as a dress rehearsal for
December elections in West Germany, as well as to expand their
party's voter support in anticipation of reunification.
   ``Let the candidates from our country take over the campaign
rostrum for the first free, fair and secret elections to
Parliament,'' Maleuda said.
   Also on Wednesday, the East German Defense Ministry responded to
reports from Washington alleging some Soviet SS-23 missiles based
in East Germany were a ``possible violation'' of the 1987
superpower treaty on eliminating intermediate-range nuclear forces.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Uwe Hempel said the rockets were
not covered by the INF accord, but that their destruction had begun
by agreement with the Soviet Union.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar was a
liar who tried to use his influence to sway criminal cases and
thwart investigations, a federal prosecutor said in closing
arguments in the judge's trial Wednesday.
   But Aguilar's lawyer described the judge as a ``kind, sweet,
generous man,'' who had done some ``foolish'' and ``improper''
things to reassure his friends but had not tampered with justice.
   ``Don't let the federal bench lose a man of this quality,''
defense lawyer Patrick Hallinan urged the jury. He contended that
the FBI, after interviewing Aguilar's fellow judges and finding no
improper influences, ``proceeded to try to create a crime'' by
entrapping Aguilar in secretly taped conversations.
   The arguments were to conclude Thursday, and the case was to go
to the jury.
   In his closing argument to the U.S. District Court jury, Justice
Department lawyer William Keefer said Aguilar lied to the FBI, told
a witness to lie to the grand jury, and lied repeatedly as a
witness in his own defense.
   Keefer said Aguilar made a ``corrupt endeavor'' to influence two
fellow judges in criminal cases, falsely told a deputy marshal he
was unaware of a fugitive's whereabouts and tried to manufacture a
coverup when the FBI closed in on him.
   The prosecutor said possible motives were a house purchase on
generous terms from the woman who was a fugitive, an interest-free
loan from a defendant in one of the criminal cases, and another
defendant's help in getting a job for a brother of the judge.
   Keefer said Aguilar was a man who thought he could get away with
breaking the rules because of his office.
   Aguilar told an ``unequivocal lie'' to FBI agents and fabricated
a story to get a grand jury investigation sidetracked, confident
that ``when a federal judge shuts the door, the door's usually
shut,'' Keefer said.
   ``The greatest failure of the prosecution is the absence of any
motive,'' Hallinan countered in his closing argument on Aguilar's
behalf.
   The ``foolish things'' he said Aguilar had done included some
lies and exaggerations to co-defendant Rudy Tham's lawyer and
others, secretly recorded and played for the jury, and a continued
association with co-defendant Abe Chapman, an elderly relative by
marriage with a long criminal record.
   ``But ladies and gentlemen, we are not in a church, we are in a
court,'' Hallinan said.
   The 58-year-old judge from San Jose, who was appointed in 1980
by President Carter, is charged with eight felonies punishable by
up to 55 years in prison and $2 million in fines on conviction. He
also could be removed from office by Congress, regardless of the
verdict.
   Aguilar is accused of approaching two fellow judges to seek
favorable treatment for Tham, a former Teamster leader who was
seeking a new trial on an embezzlement conviction, and businessman
Ronald Cloud, a longtime friend of Aguilar's convicted of bank
fraud in a Nevada casino sale.
   He is accused of helping his former legal secretary, Vera Hoff,
conceal her presence in Mexico, where she fled in 1979 to avoid a
two-year sentence for tax evasion.
   Aguilar is also accused of twice disclosing a wiretap to
Chapman, asking Tham's attorney to conceal their discussions about
the case from the grand jury, and lying to the FBI about the Tham
case and the Chapman wiretaps.
   Aguilar testified that he spoke briefly to U.S. District Judge
Stanley Weigel, asking about the status of Tham's case, and to U.S.
District Judge Samuel Conti, mentioning that Cloud was a friend as
a preface to a request to appear as a character witness.
   Weigel and Conti both said they didn't think Aguilar was trying
to influence them.

   The House ethics committee decided Wednesday
to drop its investigation of Republican Whip Newt Gingrich but will
criticize his failure to disclose the purchase of a home, the
lawmaker who filed the complaint against him said.
   ``The ethics committee has resolved the Gingrich matter by
deciding not to investigate further, but by deciding to admonish
Gingrich'' for not reporting his purchase of a home with his
daughter, said Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
   A House source, speaking only on condition he not be identified,
provided the same information about the committee decision on the
Georgia Republican.
   The panel _ formally the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct _ met behind closed doors Wednesday but made no
announcement.
   Gingrich's case has generated keen interest because he filed the
ethics complaint that triggered the investigation _ and eventual
resignation last year _ of former Speaker Jim Wright.
   A Chicago law firm hired to provide the committee advice on the
Gingrich case reportedly told the panel late last year that there
was insufficient evidence to pursue the investigation.
   Alexander, who filed two separate complaints against Gingrich,
called the committee action ``a practical resolution of the
Gingrich matter. Futher disciplinary actions against Mr. Gingrich
are therefore not needed at the present time.''
   Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said his boss would not
immediately comment on the committee decision because there had
been no formal notification from the panel.
   In a complaint filed with the committee last October, Alexander
said that Gingrich failed to make the required disclosure of the
purchase of the home with his daughter in Fulton County, Ga. in
June 1986.
   The complaint said that Gingrich's annual financial disclosure
forms beginning in 1986 failed to report the home purchase, failed
to list the property as an asset and failed to list the $77,800
mortgage as a liability.
   Members do not have to disclose financial information about
homes they live in, but Gingrich said last year this home was for
his daughter.
   At the time, Gincrich said he was ``incensed that the fact that
I helped my daughter by co-signing, or signing the note, or
whatever one calls it, gets drug out and becomes a story.''
   He said Alexander's decision to include his daughter's mortgage
in the complaint ``carries politics in the House to a new low
level. I mean it just strikes me as madness.''
   Alexander triggered the Gingrich probe last April with a
complaint that the No. 2-ranking House Republican violated violated
House rules and federal campaign finance laws in the operation of a
limited partnership created in 1984. The ``COS Limited
Partnership'' promoted ``Window of Opportunity,'' a book written by
Gingrich and two others.
   The partnership was made up of 21 individuals who each put up
$5,000 to promote the book. Gingrich was not an investor, but his
wife, a co-author, was paid more than $10,000 for running the
operation.
   The complaint contended the $105,000 raised by the partnership
could be considered income to Gingrich, in violation of House
limits on members' outside earnings, or it could constitute a gift
to Gingrich, in violation of House rules that prohibit members from
accepting gifts worth more than $100 from anyone with a direct
interest in legislation.
   The compliant also contended that if the money were considered
to be campaign contributions, Gingrich would be in violation of
reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign finance laws.
   The second complaint, filed in October, charged Gingrich with a
long list of alleged campaign finance and financial disclosure
violations.

   The nation's second lowest-paid
teachers traded pens and pencils for picket signs Wednesday in nine
counties in a dispute with the governor and legislature over a pay
raise.
   West Virginia's first school strike was expected to be joined by
teachers in more counties Thursday.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton, who earlier this week said negotiations
with the teachers were over because of the strike threat, told a
joint Senate and House of Delegates session Wednesday night he is
willing to resume talks if the teachers return to the classroom.
   ``When calm and reason are restored and the teaching force
returns to the classrooms, I will begin again to meet with the
educational community to plan for the improvements of education on
every level, including teacher pay,'' Caperton said in his
six-minute address.
   But Caperton also reiterated his refusal to ask for a teacher
pay raise in the face of a strike threat.
   ``Let me say again: This state government will not conduct its
affairs under intimidation,'' he said, receiving a standing ovation
from senators and delegates.
   West Virginia Education Association President Kayetta Meadows
said after Caperton's address that her group is willing to meet
with him but isn't ready to call off the strike ``at this point.''
   Teachers in at least 18 more counties planned to strike
Thursday, said WVEA spokeswoman Jackie Goodwin, but educators in
one county voted to stay on the job.
   ``We're committed to keeping it up as long as we have to,'' said
Connie Taylor, an English and speech teacher on picket duty at Oak
Hill High School in Fayette County.
   The association, which represents 16,000 of the state's 22,000
public school teachers, says average teacher pay in the state was
$21,904, 49th in the nation behind Mississippi, before a 5 percent
pay raise last month. An additional 3,000 teachers are represented
by the West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   The walkout began after Caperton and legislative leaders on
Tuesday withdrew their offer of an additional 5 percent pay raise,
beginning in July, for teachers and higher education employees. In
exchange, they wanted an end to strike threats by the two teacher
unions.
   The agreement collapsed 14 hours after it was announced after
the WVEA refused to call off the strike, saying instead it would
defer action until after Saturday's end of the legislative session.
   House Speaker Chuck Chambers and Senate President Keith Burdette
said the continued strike threat made it impossible for them to win
passage of the pay raise, which would have been financed by a new
$1 per ton tax on coal mining.
   Some teachers blamed the walkout on Caperton.
   ``We did not want to strike,'' said Ted Dixon, co-president of
the Fayette County Education Association. ``But he's put the
teachers in West Virginia in this posture.''
   About 1,000 students from five Monongalia County secondary
schools left classes Wednesday in support of their teachers. The
walkouts lasted less than an hour.
   School staff employees in Monongalia County were urged not to
cross teachers' picket lines beginning Thursday.
   ``We support our teachers,'' said Janice Wilson, president of
Monongalia County School Service Personnel. ``We don't think they
should be 49th in the nation in pay. But we don't think a walkout
is the answer.''
   At Back Creek Elementary near Inwood in Berkeley County, parents
plan to join teachers on the picket line Thursday to show their
support, said parents' organizer Debbie Dunnigan.
   ``We want to send a message to Governor Caperton that we're mad
as hell, that we're not going to put up with this anymore, and if
we don't invest in our children's future today, there's not going
to be a future for them tomorrow,'' Dunnigan said.
   County school boards canceled classes Wednesday in many counties
hit by the strike. In Boone County, 17 of 433 teachers reported for
work.
   State law does not permit teachers or other employees to engage
in collective bargaining, and Attorney General Roger Tompkins said
he has found nothing in the law to permit a strike.
   The teacher unions, however, contend a 1980 Supreme Court
decision gives all public employees the right to engage in work
stoppages.

   Lithuania's parliament will meet this weekend to
declare independence from the Soviet Union, activists in the Baltic
republic said Wednesday.
   Sweeping victories in recent elections have given backers of
Sajudis, the pro-independence popular movement, dominance in the
Lithuanian parliament, and Sajudis leaders have decided to force
the issue of secession, activist Audris Siaurusavicius said.
   Vilnius Radio reported that Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday to
discuss secession, and was presented with a bill for $34 billion
that the republic supposedly owes the Soviet Union for resources
invested there.
   ``But Lithuania has not presented its bill yet to the Soviet
Union,'' for losses incurred by 50 years of Soviet rule,
Siaurusavicius said.
   Brazauskas, speaking Wednesday night on Lithuanian television,
said there was no need ``to frighten ourselves and others'' about
the economic consequences of secession. He said the republic would
be so much better off on its own that the advantages would offset
its debt to Moscow, according to Eduardas Potashinskas, another
Sajudis activist.
   According to a draft law currently under consideration in the
Soviet legislature, a republic that wants to secede faces a series
of lengthy procedures, including a five-year cooling-off period and
required approval from the 2,250-member Congress of People's
Deputies.
   The Soviet constitution guarantees republics the right to
secede, but the procedure has not been spelled out in Soviet law.
   The parliament is sure ``to come out with some form of
declaration of independence'' when it meets Sunday, said
Potashinskas, an editor at Lithuanian TV, in a telephone interview
from Vilnius, Lithuania's capital.
   Pro-secession sentiment in Lithuania has been swelling for
months, but Sajudis decided to move now to pre-empt Gorbachev's
plans for a vastly more powerful presidency with the right to crack
down on restive republics. The national Congress is to meet Monday
to consider the presidency proposal.
   ``Why so fast? I think Gorbachev himself created such a
reaction,'' said Siaurusavicius, a reporter for Rebirth, the
Sajudis newspaper. ``If there were no such proposal on the
presidency, we wouldn't have done this now.''
   Gorbachev has repeatedly denounced ``separatists'' and asked
activists to give Moscow time to work out the terms of a new Soviet
federation before moving to secede.
   The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet will meet Saturday night to settle
procedural questions and address independence on Sunday, said
Siaurusavicius.
   Siaurusavicius said it was not clear what changes would
immediately follow the declaration. ``We just have to say it. This
is not secession but it's saying they must end their annexation _
they should leave.''
   All three Baltic republics, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, were
independent nations between the two world wars. They were annexed
by the Soviet Union in 1940 while under occupation by the Red Army.
   Siaurusavicius said Sajudis leaders were expecting Moscow's
response to the declaration of independence to be restrained, and
did not anticipate use of force. But he said the republic of 3.7
million people could already feel the effects of a mounting Soviet
economic blockade, with many factories hurting for raw materials
and expecting the pinch to get worse.
   He predicted the Soviet Union would probably not be among the
first to respond to Lithuania's planned appeal to the countries of
the world to recognize it as a full-fledged sovereign state.
   The declaration will technically be merely a reconfirmation of
Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1918, Siaurusavicius
said.
   Last month, the Lithuanian parliament passed a measure declaring
as ``unlawful and invalid'' the 1940 act that incorporated the
republic into the Soviet Union. It called for talks with the
Kremlin on restoring Lithuanian independence.
   An article in the government newspaper Izvestia on Wednesday
complained that ``Lithuania is getting public opinion used to the
fact that it `is leaving,''' without thinking through the economic
and political difficulties secession will create.
   ``God, can we really imagine what pain, suffering, clashes and
insults this break threatens?'' wrote L. Kapeliushny, Izvestia's
correspondent in Vilnius.
   He listed among expected problems trade imbalances, the
difficulty of deciding what to do about various Soviet-built
factories and the fate of Lithuanian residents who want to retain
their Soviet citizenship.
   About half the Soviet Union's 15 republics now have popular
groups pushing for independence or greater sovereignty, including
Moldavia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista leaders say they'll hand
over the government on April 25, but their local forces don't
appear ready to hand over their guns.
   The army, a party organ, is delivering truckloads of assault
rifles to civilians in Jinotega and Matagalpa provinces who live in
the poor neighborhoods the leftist Sandinistas regard as their
``social base.''
   ``All the barrios have guns. They are all defending their
land,'' said Francisca Castileblanco, a 52-year-old tortilla
vendor, showing off her new AK-47.
   High-ranking Sandinista officials in Jinotega and Matagalpa at
first denied civilians were being armed.
   When confronted with evidence, the officials asserted they were
creating a self-defense network to fend off possible attacks by
Contra forces that the Sandinistas have been battling for years.
   But they also acknowledged that guns are going to people living
on land confiscated after the 1979 revolution, areas the party
regards as its grassroots.
   The Sandinistas have said they will ``defend the conquests of
the revolution,'' including opposing any efforts to return land to
previous owners and possibly other aspects of the conservative
economic policies of the new government of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro said Wednesday he is cutting off
all military aid to Nicaragua before the Chamorro government takes
office on April 25, Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City, reported.
   It quoted Castro as saying that Cuban assistance in housing
construction and health care could continue if the new government
desires.
   Officials of the United National Opposition say they won't
dislodge peasants from land that is being worked, even if it was
expropriated under Sandinista rule.
   ``There is a little tension,'' acknowledged Col. Manuel
Salvatierra, the regional military commander. ``There is a lot of
uncertainty about what will happen when the new government takes
over.''
   International observers, diplomats and opposition officials are
worried about the large-scale distribution of weapons at a time
when tensions are so high.
   ``It's a time bomb,'' said Luis Serrano, part of the
Organization of American States observer team monitoring Matagalpa
and Jinotega provinces.
   Officials of the United National Opposition, the conservative
coalition that defeated the Sandinistas in the Feb. 25 elections,
say they have reports of arms being distributed in several other
provinces and that the issue is on the agenda for transition
negotiations between the Sandinistas and UNO.
   UNO representatives have also met with top-ranking regional
officials of the Sandinista party and the Sandinista army, said
Santiago Rivas, UNO's legal adviser in Matagalpa, 78 miles north of
Managua.
   ``We've argued that they shouldn't give arms to civilians. It
could provoke a civil war,'' Rivas said in an interview.
   Their rallies resound with political battle cries such as ``One
Single Army,'' a slogan expressing the revolutionary goal of
melding the people, the party and the military into a united armed
force.
   ``They are trying to intimidate,'' said the Rev. Eliar Pineda, a
Roman Catholic priest in Jinotega whose family backed UNO.
   Sandinista gangs known as ``turbas'' have demonstrated in
Jinotega, 100 miles north of Managua, and in Matagalpa since the
election. Intimidated UNO supporters have stayed at home rather
than celebrate the coalition's resounding victory at the polls.
   ``They are afraid of provoking the Sandinistas,'' Pineda said.
   Rivas said UNO fears an attempt to destabilize the country
during the delicate transition from a leftist Sandinista government
to the UNO, with its free-market philosphy.
   ``The top Sandinista leadership seems disposed to hand over
power, but at the midlevel, there are those who want to create a
coup at the base of the party,'' he said.
   President Daniel Ortega has said there will be a peaceful
transition of power. But he and other Sandinista leaders have made
it clear the smoothness of that transition depends in large part
upon negotiations to demobilize the U.S.-backed Contras and an
agreement on the armed forces.
   Property is another critical issue in the transition.
   UNO policy is to privatize as much as possible of the state-run
economy without evicting people from confiscated lands. But
Sandinista campaign rhetoric and the party-controlled media have
spread fear and doubt among the poor.
   ``The people here are afraid of losing their land,'' said Mrs.
Castileblanco, the tortilla vendor and a party organizer in Barrio
Roger Angin, a slum of 400 homes without water and electricity on
confiscated land on the edge of Jinotega.
   She went into her house, a ramshackle shell of mismatched planks
and tin over a dirt floor, and pulled out her new AK-47.
   It is one of 400 assault rifles she and her neighbors said the
army delivered on Feb. 27, two days after the election. Mrs.
Castileblanco and her neighbors say the AK-47s were distributed to
anyone age 15 and over.
   In Matagalpa, residents of the Pancasan neighborhood told a
similar story. When asked what the guns were for, 16-year-old Jose
Alexis Guido Gonzalez said: ``If the Contra comes or if the UNO
comes to kick on our door. We can use these arms against anyone who
is against us.''
   Sandinista officials say they are arming people against the
possibility of a Contra offensive. The rash of desertions from the
army following the victory of Mrs. Chamorro, who promised to
abolish the despised draft, also appears to be a factor.
   ``The opposition has put out a demobilization message,'' said
Carlos Zamora, the top-ranking Sandinista party official in the
region. ``If this keeps up, the army could end up without
conscripts.''

   The Internal Revenue Service, hoping to expose drug
kingpins, has served summonses on criminal defense attorneys across
the country demanding the names of clients who paid cash for fees
exceeding $10,000.
   The first summonses went out Monday. The number issued was not
immmediately known, but one lawyer served said an IRS agent told
him 900 attorneys were to receive summonses demanding their
financial records.
   ``It's very clear what the issue is here. ... It grows out of
concerns about drug payments,'' said David Runkel, spokesman for
the U.S. Justice Department, which has taken two New York City law
firms to court for refusing to name clients for the IRS.
   Lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate
attorney-client privilege.

   Nearly two years after the roof ripped off an
aging Boeing 737 jetliner over Hawaii, the government is imposing
the first set of parts-replacement rules for older planes.
   At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration announced
plans worked out with the aviation industry to require a detailed
cycle of inspections for corrosion in Boeing airliners.
   The final rules announced Tuesday are aimed at correcting
metal-fatigue problems in airliners that have gone through
thousands of takeoffs and landings. They require replacements of
parts and will cost airlines an estimated $142 million over the
next four years.
   The anti-corrosion measures are estimated to cost between
$38,720 for each Boeing 737 over the six-year inspection cycle,
$80,000 for each Boeing 727, $80,640 for each Boeing 707 and
$188,800 for each Boeing 747.

   Union officials are counting on some
Republican House members to desert President Bush and help override
his veto of a bill that would have the government intervene in the
year-old Eastern Airlines strike.
   A House vote was possible this afternoon on Bush's veto of a
measure creating a special panel to investigate and recommend
possible solutions to the bitter dispute between the carrier and
8,500 mechanics and other ground service workers.
   Some override supporters said late Tuesday they were still at
least a few votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority in the
435-member House to override the Republican president. Others said
it was too close to call. Republican help is crucial, since the
chamber has 257 Democrats and 175 Republicans. There are three
vacancies.

   Ah, the fruits of glasnost.
   At last, Soviet citizens will be able to watch a movie in a
darkened box while spilling popcorn in their laps and getting their
shoes glued to the floor in some mysterious, gummy substance, just
like Americans.
   Two of those multiple-screen movie theaters that are fixtures in
suburban shopping malls across the United States will make their
debut in downtown Moscow and Leningrad in late 1991, U.S. and
Soviet film officials announced Tuesday.
   The new movie palaces will feature state-of-the-art projection
and Dolby stereo sound systems, marble and neon lobbies, concession
stands selling genuine American popcorn, computerized ticket
booths, restaurants, souvenir shops and video game arcades.

<HEAD>Confession Practices Split Catholic Bishops, Laity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholics still believe confession is good
for the soul, but many disagree with their bishops on whether the
sacrament of penance is a necessary way to reach reconciliation
with God.
   In a survey of bishops and parishioners, the church hierarchy
said the loss of a sense of sin was the top reason for smaller
lines at church confessionals, while the first reason listed by
laity was that reconciliation was being experienced by other means,
including the sacrament of Holy Communion.
   The differing perspectives were so great that a less pervasive
sense of sin was only seventh on the laity's list of reasons
Catholics are going to confession less frequently, while the idea
reconciliation is experienced by other means was fifth on the
bishops' list.
   For better and worse, the sons and daughters of European
immigrant Catholics who once filled confessionals each week have
become part of the American mainstream, said the Rev. Michael J.
Walsh, executive director of the Secretariat for Pastoral Research
and Practices of the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   ``What has happened with Western culture in general is that the
anchor in the Judeo-Christian culture has been loosened by
secularization,'' Walsh said.
   The study undertaken by the Committee for Pastoral Research and
Practices of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops surveyed
2,500 priests, 2,850 active lay Catholics and about 380 bishops in
the spring and summer of 1988. The majority of Catholics surveyed,
55 percent, said they went to confession once or twice a year. Four
percent said they went once a week, 5 percent said they went
monthly, and 17 percent said every two or three months. Nineteen
percent said they never celebrated the sacrament. An average of 1.8
hours a week is scheduled for confessions in parishes.
   The bishops attributed the decline in confessions to a less
pervasive sense of sin, confusion about what is morally right and
wrong and disagreement with the church's moral teaching.
   The report of the committee on pastoral practices said the
individualism and religious pluralism in American culture have
taken a toll on Catholics, many of whom are no longer willing to
submit to ``the claims on human freedom posed by God and others.''
   While pluralism encourages a perspective that all systems are
equally valid, the bishops' committee said, ``Its most practical
consequence, however, is the creation of an environment of total
relativism...''
   ``The naming, confronting, repenting and confessing of one's
sins is never easy. Amid the cacophony of moral claims, it becomes
even more difficult,'' the committee said.
   The issue was viewed differently from the pew, with lay
Catholics saying they are experiencing forgiveness by other means
than confession.
   ``The part that surprised me was the comfortableness with which
people find reconciliation by other means,'' said Bishop John J.
McRaith of the Diocese of Owensboro, Ky.
   More than 80 percent of the lay respondents said they
experienced reconciliation by receiving the Eucharist. Other ways
Catholics reported experiencing forgiveness were by personal
prayer, making an act of contrition, talking with a friend, doing
charitable works and reading the Bible.
   The priests surveyed were divided on the issue, saying general
confusion over what is right and wrong and the fact laypeople are
experiencing forgiveness by other means were the two main reasons
for the drop in confessions. They also said an ``excessive sense of
guilt'' motivated many confessions in the past.
   The good news in the survey, the bishops' committee said, was
that although Catholics are going to confession less often, ``the
quality of those sacramental encounters has improved.''
   Bishops, priests and laity all expressed particular satisfaction
with penance services during which individual confessions are heard
as part of a liturgical celebration.
   ``People were pleased with the forms of communal penance
service,'' McRaith said. ``The emphasis was placed on the quality
of the celebration of the sacrament.''
   For their part, priests requested greater training for their
role as confessors, particularly with regard to the new
possibilities for moral and spiritual dialogue created by the
revised rites of penance, which offer the option of face-to-face
confessions.
   The bishops' committee recommended that dioceses give priority
to training priests and seminarians as confessors.
   The committee's recommendations for increasing interest in the
sacrament of penance also included not limiting penance services to
Advent and Lent and considering offering confessions at more
convenient times, such as before Mass.
   ``(Confession) needs to be different from what it was years
ago,'' McRaith said.

<HEAD>GOP Strategist Says Democrats Practically Conceding Bush A Second
Term</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By Republican calculation, any Democrat who
wants to challenge President Bush for the White House in 1992
should be at work by now, piling up primary campaign money at a
rate of about $250,00 a week. None is, and a GOP strategist claims
that just about concedes Bush a second term.
   Ed Rollins acknowledges his is a partisan analysis. It is a
wishful one, too, with the next presidential election more than 30
months away. As Bush has said, popularity ratings that soar, as
they have in his case, also can plummet.
   Nevertheless, the political circumstances of 1990 may do what
political reformers long have advocated, and abbreviate the
campaign for the White House. The standard campaign plan has been
based on an early, usually undeclared start by a presidential
candidate, especially one running against an incumbent president.
   It isn't happening this time.
   The prospective challengers all have other things to do. In the
last two elections in which incumbents were unseated, the winners,
Democrat Jimmy Carter and, four years later, Republican Ronald
Reagan were fulltime campaigners, former governors without other
duties.
   With the public opinion polls putting Bush at record approval
ratings, running against him doesn't look like an inviting
assignment at this point. That may change; the law of political
gravity will pull the poll ratings down eventually. But if Bush can
go into his next campaign at anything even approaching his current
standing, the odds will be long against his challenger.
   So a waiting game makes sense for Democrats, especially those
with the ambition to run but the option of waiting until 1996 to do
it. And that means most of them.
   There's also an increased demand for pre-season fund raising in
1992, with costly California in the process of moving its primary
election from the end of the schedule to near the beginning. That
means assigning the biggest single bloc of nominating votes in
March instead of June.
   It will send Democratic contestants into the most expensive of
primary campaigns in a state in which Jesse Jackson gained 35
percent of the Democratic primary vote in 1988. Jackson has just
announced that he won't run for mayor of Washington, which probably
means that he will run a third time for the Democratic nomination.
The new calendar works in his favor. The leadoff states, Iowa and
New Hampshire, are not his territory _ his 1988 percentages there
were in single digits. But California would quickly eclipse them,
and the southern Super Tuesday primaries follow that.
   That raises the prospect that the Democratic nominee would have
to get around a strengthened Jackson, trying not to alienate his
black and liberal constituency, and struggling to stay near enough
to the political center to have a chance against an incumbent
Republican.
   Rollins, co-chairman and operational chief of the Republican
congressional campaign committee, said ``we expect at this point
for George Bush to have a tremendous victory. ... Democrats are
almost conceding,'' he told the National Association of Home
Builders.
   The Democrats, of course, say they are doing no such thing.
   Rollins, who managed Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, said
that for the first time in years, there are no serious candidates
for president working to round up the people and the money for a
campaign.
   ``If you're not off and running four years in advance, you won't
have the resources to be a viable candidate for the presidency,''
he said. ``And now that they've moved California up front ... think
in terms of the cost.''
   Rollins said a candidate would have to have $2 million to $3
million committed in advance in order to be a serious contender in
the California primary. And that's only the beginning.
   ``Which means if you start right today, you have to raise about
$250,000 a week, every week,'' Rollins said. ``So any of you who
are interested in running for president, get started.''
   At least the slow start will put conventional wisdom to the
test, breaking what has become a pattern of almost permanent
presidential campaigns.

<TEXT>
   Thanks to Eugene Lang's impulsive promise at a
grade-school graduation, 90 percent of the Class of 1981 at East
Harlem's P.S. 121 now has graduated from high school.
   Half have gone on to Bard, Swarthmore, Barnard and other
universities, spurred by the millionaire's vow to pay the college
tuition of each of the 61 students if they got high school
diplomas. And around the country, others have copied Lang's
largesse.
   Lang doesn't take credit for the inroads made by his young
proteges. Their own hard work and dedication brought them this far,
he says. But like a proud grandfather, he brags about what they've
accomplished.
   ``I fully expect two-thirds of the class to complete at least
two years of college,'' he says.
   In 1981, he said, ``I asked the principal of the school how many
of these kids would go to college, and he told me maybe one.''
   The avuncular Lang wasn't always so upbeat. At a 1985 lunch with
Harlem social worker Dorothy Stoneman, Lang recalls bemoaning what
he saw as a lack of progress: smart-aleck truants, apathetic
parents, uninterested students.
   ``You don't know how to look,'' Stoneman interrupted. ``Dammit,
Gene, wake up _ don't you realize that every one of your kids is
still in school?''
   It was true. The track record of Lang's kids was phenomenal in a
neighborhood where one in every two students drops out.
   Stoneman's dressing-down left the millionaire entrepreneur
feeling terrific. He decided to parlay his impulsive personal
adventure into a national program, the I Have a Dream Foundation.
At latest count, 130 sponsors in 32 cities are backing more than
8,000 dreamers.
   Sponsors range from New York investment banker Felix Rohatyn to
presidential nephew James Bush. Others patch together the required
$300,000 with contributions from churches, civic groups and friends.
   The money is deposited in annuity funds operated by the
foundation, and eventually pays tuition at a city or state college.
Students eying private schools hustle for scholarships to make up
the difference.
   ``The college scholarship is the ultimate plum for
sixth-graders, but its not the motivating plum,'' Lang said. ``The
big issue is keeping them in school and encouraging every kid to
identify a future, to have a dream.''
   Problems dogged the original class of dreamers. Several dropped
out, but most were persuaded to return to school. Six became
pregnant, one with three children, but are expected to receive high
school diplomas. One boy spent time in Attica state prison for
attempted robbery; another is at Sing Sing, though he is taking
college classes at Lang's behest.
   Keeping kids on track takes constant attention, so Lang, the
head of Refac Corp., delegated authority to John Rivera, a
neighborhood youth worker.
   Rivera, 27, describes his own high school counseling as ``five
minutes and an Army recruiting brochure.''
   As the program coordinator, he played nagging parent, big
brother and best friend, watching report cards, arranging for
tutors, setting up rap sessions and taking students to college
fairs.
   ``Johnny showed me how to take all my negatives and turn them
into positives,'' said David Nieves, a sophomore at Lower Manhattan
Community College. Math nearly ended high school for him until
Rivera found the right tutor, Nieves said.
   ``He was the person everyone related to. He pulled it all
together,'' said Juan Martinez, a junior at Swarthmore. ``Gene Lang
was sort of a far-away figure, but through Johnny, he pulled it all
together.''
   Rousana Serrano, an economics major at Barnard College planning
on a career in commercial banking, said the key is catching kids
young, before they're hardened by the street.
   ``You really have to start molding a kid's mind early,'' she
said, ``so that they say, `What kind of question is that, if I'm
going to college or not? Of course I am.'''
   The attitude that ``school is not cool'' is the biggest
obstacle, Rivera said. Break that with a little outside help, he
said, and East Harlem students can and do go anywhere.
   ``These are the same old kids in the same old neighborhood, but
Gene injected some outside influence,'' Rivera said. ``He isn't a
knight on a white horse. He's a warm human representative from
south of 96th Street. We go down Fifth Avenue and all we see is the
doorman in the uniform outside, and we could never go in.''
   ``It brought two vastly different societies together,'' said
Martinez, who once was awestruck by ``the millionaire,'' but now
prefers to argue about international economics when visiting Lang's
midtown office.
   To stop recycling the problems of the inner city, everyone must
be included _ the gifted and the ungifted, Lang said.
   Rivera points to a small miracle among the ungifted: three
special-education students from the Class of '81, armed with their
high school diplomas and now taking college classes.
   ``This is unheard of,'' he said. ``Few special-education
students graduate from high school, let alone go on to college.''
   With so many of the students at college, Rivera's role in the
program scaled down, so he left to pursue a dream of his own. He's
studying sociology at Hunter College, a junior like the other
dreamers.

   The sight of ``Iron Mike'' Tyson on the canvas
and Drexel Burnham Lambert similarly flattened has prompted the
pundits to proclaim the end of an era. The end of the '80s of
excess.
   From the separated Trumps to contaminated Perrier, the evidence
seems to be all around us.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton, junk bonds, the Dow Jones average, the
Hunt brothers, Kohlberg Kravis, RJR Nabisco _ it just seems like
everyone and everything that used to be riding high are sinking
fast.
   As a matter of fact, the sound of the mighty falling is getting
pretty distracting.
   Like Iron Mike, they mostly all complain they didn't see it
coming.
   Worse, the experts herald the end of modern gluttony as we know
it, noting the obvious coincidence of the opening of a new decade.
   But these sudden shifts, as cataclysmic as they might seem to
30-something eyes, are really not the end of anything. They might
be more accurately described as reruns of a very old show, which
aside from titillation provide fresh lessons in a law as undeniable
as gravity.
   Since Midas, perhaps since Adam, the consequences of risky
business have been spurned to the peril of those who dare to pursue
happiness a little too voraciously.
   In the vernacular, the chickens always come home to roost.
   What goes around, comes around. Again and again and again.
   Anyone who doubts these fundamentals need only look as far as
the next headline. New Coke is coming around again, for heaven's
sake.
   What is so surprising about all these earth-shattering events is
not their occurrence, but our reaction. Our jaws drop at the news
that Tyson's brow has been busted by a fellow named Douglas and
that Drexel has met a bankruptcy-court fate worse than Rudolph
Giuliani.
   What is all the fuss about? Hasn't it always been true that the
bigger they are, the harder they fall?
   The case could generally be made, could it not, that flabbiness
breeds carelessness whether we're talking about prizefighters or
junk-bond underwriters.
   Yet even those who are 40-something, 50-something, 60-something
and beyond seem awe-struck by recent events. That includes a lot of
people who saw Gene Tunney upset Jack Dempsey and Glass-Steagall
break up the Morgan dynasty on Wall Street.
   Maybe our hearts are leading us astray. With the endless
economic expansion and the fall of communism, it's hard to imagine
a war we can't win today.
   But the road of American history is littered with blown tires.
If you've read the account of the RJR Nabisco fight, ``Barbarians
at the Gate'' by reporters Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, move on
to an even fatter tome now heading for the bookstores, called ``The
House of Morgan'' by Ron Chernow.
   The reading experience will provide ample proof that Henry
Kravis, Peter Cohen and Michael Milken were not the first
barbarians to crash Wall Street's gates. The Morgan empire grew
into such a financial behemoth that Congress was inspired to
legislate against it and erect a legal wall between the banking and
securities businesses. So was born the Glass-Steagall act of 1933.
   A little more than half a century later, after gargantuan merger
fees pushed the pendulum all the way back in favor of brokerage
houses, lawmakers began to mull the repeal of Glass-Steagall.
   When they say it just can't happen, the champ is invincible, the
deal is airtight or the business is too big to fail, think about
all those previously vanquished barbarians.
   The talent for making the same mistake much more than once is
peculiarly American. From celebrity to captain of industry, we love
to demonstrate just how easy it is to abuse the secrets of our
success.

<DATELINE>BEAR RIVER, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a century after the blood of
hundreds of Northwestern Shoshones soaked the snowy banks of the
Bear River, the federal government may be ready to admit its
soldiers perpetrated a massacre unrivaled in the annals of the West.
   Since Jan. 29, 1863, this site 110 miles north of Salt Lake City
has been known for the ``Battle of Bear River,'' described by Col.
Patrick Connor as a glorious struggle won by classic military
tactics and superior firepower.
   Ignored were persistent Shoshone claims to the contrary.
Survivors recounted Connor's ``battle'' as a day of savagery in
which soldiers smashed infants' skulls, raped dying squaws and
dispatched the wounded with bullets, clubs and axes.
   Connor lost 14 of his 200 men. An estimated 270 to 400 Shoshones
died, two-thirds of them women and children.
   Edwin C. Bearss, chief historian for the National Park Service,
says that after extensive study, he agrees history should be
rewritten to reflect the Shoshone account.
   ``The attack was sharp, sudden and vigorous. There were heavy
casualties,'' he said. ``A good case can be made that there were
more Indian casualties in this attack than any other by U.S. forces
west of the Mississippi.''
   Bear River was ``much more grim'' than better-known Indian
massacres at Sand Creek, in Colorado Territory, where 133 Cheyennes
were killed by troopers Nov. 28, 1864, and at Wounded Knee, S.D.,
where soldiers slaughtered 153 Sioux on Dec. 28, 1890, Bearss said.
But any news of the attack was pushed out of most newspapers by
dispatches from fierce Civil War battles that killed tens of
thousands at Fredericksburg, Va., and Stone's River, Tenn.
   Estimates of how many Indians died at Bear River vary because no
official count was made. Tradition has it that Connor counted
bodies from horseback and recorded 220-270 dead. Settlers who went
in later found many more bodies in ravines or under deep snow and
put the number as high as 500. The tribe says 400 of their number
were killed. No more than 60 escaped or survived.
   On April 3, Bearss will recommend that the site, just outside
Preston, Idaho, be granted National Historic Landmark status as the
``Bear River Massacre.'' If it passes muster with the agency's
advisory panel, the proposal will be sent to Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan Jr., probably in May.
   As for Connor's version, Bearss says history is replete with
lies or omissions made to paint heroic pictures. Connor and his
California Volunteers had signed up to fight Johnny Reb; their
posting to the Great Basin to protect Mormon settlers and keep an
eye on Indians was galling.
   Attacking an Indian village was a poor substitute for
battlefield glory, but it was all the ambitious Connor had to
impress his superiors.
   ``If I was a colonel,'' Bearss said, ``it would be to my
career's benefit if I portrayed (Bear River) as a pitched battle.
As a career soldier, you're looking for career success, and body
counts have always been important.''
   In late January 1863, hundreds of Indians had set up tepees at
``Bia Ogoi,'' or Bear River, for the Warm Dance, an annual winter
ritual to drive away the cold.
   The night of Jan. 27, one tribal elder awoke from a nightmarish
vision: The white man's pony soldiers were slaughtering his people.
Tin Dup, convinced this was a warning from the Great Spirit, told
anyone who would listen to flee.
   ``Do it now! Tonight!'' he begged them.
   Few left with Tin Dup. Most dismissed the gloomy prediction,
which belied a peaceful scene of warm campfires and sleepy
conversation.
   A variety of sources, including Army reports, books and
carefully preserved tribal oral histories, prove Tin Dup a
visionary.
   Just before dawn on Jan. 29, Connor's cavalry formed up on
bluffs towering 200 feet above Chief Sagwitch Timbimboo's
still-sleeping encampment. Thinned by frostbite from its original
275 men after a three-day march from Utah's Fort Douglas, 110 miles
to the south, the unit had a mission to ``chastise'' and
``exterminate'' Indians responsible for recent clashes with whites.
   Three Shoshones had stolen some horses and cattle a few weeks
before. Connor also blamed them for the slayings of a miner and two
settlers. The Shoshone insisted the killings were the work of other
Indians.
   Across the Bear River, Sagwitch rose early to watch his camp
awaken. Suddenly, his eyes were drawn to the eastern hills. A
strange mist was moving down the slopes, out of which thundered
Connor's soldiers.
   Even as his startled warriors gathered bows, tomahawks and a few
muskets, Sagwitch ordered them not to shoot, believing the soldiers
would seek to parley. Had Connor asked for the livestock thieves,
they would have been surrendered, according to tribal accounts.
   Connor's belief in the Shoshones' hostile intent could only have
been strengthened by Mormon scout Orrin Porter Rockwell, bodyguard
of pioneer Brigham Young. Rockwell, who would watch the bloodshed
from the safety of the bluffs, had told Connor that up to 600
Shoshone warriors were battle ready, according to a 1985 history.
   Connor sent his cavalry across the river, determined to cut off
any retreat. As the infantry closed in, the Indians ran for the
ice-clogged river. Its banks soon were bloody with wounded and
dead. Squaws, many with infants strapped to their backs, joined the
desperate plunge. Most drowned, others were shot as they swam. A
few escaped.
   Sagwitch, wounded in one hand, tumbled into the river and
floated under some brush. After nightfall, he and a few warriors
found ponies and fled north.
   Back in camp, soldiers took babies by the heels and dashed them
to death. Squaws, helpless from their wounds, were raped even as
they died.
   Another chief, Bear Hunter, endured a savage beating. His wife,
Be-ah-wa-a-chee, who watched from her concealment in nearby
willows, recalled that Bear Hunter did not cry out, even when
soldiers rammed a heated bayonet through his head, ear to ear.
   Sagwitch's 12-year-old grandson, Yeager Timbimboo, played dead.
A soldier who discovered him alive raised his musket to the boy's
head three times but couldn't fire.
   The trooper walked away, leaving the youth to grow old and tell
a story far different than the account of a pitched battle given by
soon-to-be Brig. Gen. Patrick Connor.

   One who heard his story was his granddaughter, Mae Timbimboo
Parry. For Parry, who has spent much of her 70 years gathering the
tribe's oral history, landmark designation of the Bear River site
is long overdue.
   ``I've been telling this story for so long, I felt I was like
the Lone Ranger,'' she said. ``I'll say it was a massacre to my
dying day.''
   So will Allie Hansen, president of the Bear River-Battle Creek
Monument Association, although that wasn't always the case.
   In 1986, her group was behind passage of a resolution by Utah
and Idaho legislators that would have erected a Battle of Bear
River monument. But Parry threatened to sue, insisting the word
``battle'' had no place in commemoration of a massacre.
   To resolve the dispute, Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, asked the
Park Service to study the attack as part of a landmark application.
The assignment went to Bearss, a Civil War expert.
   Meantime, Hansen's own research convinced her the Indians were
right. A descendant of southern Idaho homesteaders, she said she
had been ``naively kept in the dark.''
   She also learned to appreciate the tiny tribe's intensity about
the massacre. ``Even after all this time, to them it is like
something that just happened,'' Hansen said.
   Perhaps, Parry said, that is because the massacre was the
tribe's Holocaust. In the 1860s, the Northwestern Shoshone thrived,
following game and the seasons over a range that included eastern
Nevada, northern Utah, southern Idaho and Wyoming.
   Today, the tribe counts only 350 members.
   ``We have never recovered from the massacre,'' Parry said.
``We've never quite recovered.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ While capitalism is slowly gaining ground in the
struggling Marxist nations of Africa, autocratic rulers are not
yielding to the kind of political reforms that brought down the
Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe. A sudden explosion of democracy on
this continent is not seen as likely.

   In the face of their own failures and
the success of the democracy movement in Eastern Europe, many
African leaders are turning away from the communist economic
theories with which they greeted independence.
   But if they have accepted the need to embrace capitalism, fewer
seem willing to renounce the type of autocratic rule until recently
practiced by the Eastern European and Soviet heirs of Marx and
Lenin.
   Perestroika, or change, has come to Africa. The openness of
glasnost trails well behind.
   Only last Monday, Mengistu Haile Marian, who as president of
Ethiopia has been the Soviet Union's staunchest ally in Africa for
15 years, tossed in the socialist towel and said his country should
adopt a free market economy.
   But like so many other African leaders who have seen a
capitalist light at the end of a dark economic tunnel, Mengistu did
not call for a multiparty system nor did he suggest that his ruling
Marxist-Leninist Party loosen its constitutional grip on a monopoly
of power.
   ``The great winds carrying democracy ... that have shaken the
countries of Eastern Europe will not shake the coconut trees in
Africa,'' commented the national newspaper of Gabon.
   Most African nations gained their independence from colonial
rule during the height of the Cold War, their struggles for freedom
against Western powers sometimes openly abetted and always cheered
by the Soviet Union and its allies.
   Scarred by their colonial experience under Britain, France,
Portugal, Spain and, until the end of World War II, Italy and
Germany, Africa's new nations generally opted for the social and
economic models they found in Moscow, Warsaw and East Berlin.
   Today, most of the sub-Saharan African nations _ South Africa
being an exception, along with Senegal, Mauritius, Zimbabwe,
Botswana and newly free Namibia _ are under military, dictatorial
or one-party rule marked by authoritarianism, a sharp intolerance
of opposition and presidential terms of office limited only by
death or revolution.
   Many are avowedly socialist.
   But while showing little inclination to relax their grip on
power, even some of the most Marxist-oriented governments are
moving toward economic liberalization in a transformation
encouraged by one simple fact: Most aid, advice and investment in
recent years has come not from the crumbling Soviet empire, but
from the West.
   And that aid _ totaling more than $11 billion in 1987 _ is in
many cases all that has kept the wolf from the door in a region of
450 million people whose combined gross domestic product of $135
billion barely equals that of Belgium, with a population of only 10
million.
   In the past decade, some 30 African countries have adopted _ to
a greater or lesser degree _ economic reform programs under the
guidance of those twin pillars of capitalism, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund.
   ``We're seeing significant changes for the better throughout the
continent,'' says John Sangueme, chief executive of the Zimbabwe
National Chamber of Commerce. ``Recent events in Eastern Europe
have certainly helped bring them about, even though the process
here in Africa is not nearly as dramatic.''
   Still, Africa's slowness to adopt democratic political reforms
along with economic changes has been widely lamented both from
within and without the continent.
   The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa in a report last year
said:
   ``The political context for promoting healthy human development
has been marred for more than two decades by instability, war,
intolerance, restrictions on the freedom of individuals and groups
as well as overconcentrations of power.''
   More recently, Jacques Pelletier, the French development
minister, said Africa's nations would remain among the world's
poorest unless they followed Eastern Europe's lead in embracing
democracy along with free-market economies.
   Added the Southern African Economist, a semi-monthly magazine
published by the seven-nation South Africa Development Coordination
Conference, in a January editorial:
   ``If the Cold War is really ending, that can only help to
concentrate African minds by exposing the irrelevance of much
current ideology.''
   Some leaders are getting the hint.
   _In the tiny, bankrupt West African nation of Benin, the ruling
People's Revolutionary Party renounced communism in December and
promised constitutional reforms this year.
   _Sao Tome e Principe, a tiny island nation off the West Coast of
Africa, is permitting opposition parties to function for the first
time this year.
   _On Feb. 18, the ruling party in Cape Verde, another former
Portuguese island off the West Coast, decided to give up its
monopoly on power and switch to multiparty democracy in elections
slated for November.
   _The next day, President Mathieu Kerekou of the tiny, bankrupt
West African nation of Benin instructed a conference of government,
ruling party and opposition leaders to draw up a plan for the
democratization of the country. The group took Kerekou more
seriously than he probably intended, forcing him 10 days later to
sobbingly agree to share power with a new prime minister.
   _In January, the ruling Worker's Party of the Congo said it was
creating a commission to consider democratic changes and would
decide on its future course in June. It has ruled as a Marxist,
one-party government since 1979.
   _Mozambique, caught in a cruel civil war with right-wing rebels,
dumped Marxism as its official policy last July and announced plans
for multiparty elections this year.
   They, however, are but a fraction of sub-Sahara Africa's 45
countries, and the more dominant view is expressed by presidents
such as Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Gabon's Omar Bongo.
   Bongo said in January he didn't think most African countries
would follow Eastern Europe's example and move toward multiparty
democracies.
   Just days later, as if to prove Bongo right, Mugabe's ruling
party voted to move Zimbabwe toward a one-party Marxist state,
further away from the democracy it inherited when it gained
independence from Britain.
   And in Kenya, when a Presbyterian minister suggested from the
pulpit that African leaders should take a cue from Eastern Europe,
the chairman of the country's single party termed his suggestion
``sheer madness and folly'' and called on the church to defrock him.
   Frederick Chiluba, the chairman-general of Zambia's Congress of
Trade Unions, mused about the changes in Africa in a recent
interview.
   ``It is unfortunate that Africa, which began its march to
independence in the 1950s, found the Stalinist regime in power,''
Chiluba said. ``Having been colonized by Western powers, Africans
found sympathy with the Stalinist regime and criticism became
taboo.''
   But Chiluba found some hope:
   ``Developments in Eastern Europe particularly are bound to
influence man everywhere.''

<HEAD>Frank Greer: This Year's Hot Political Consultant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   On the wall by Frank Greer's office door is a
Doug Wilder campaign poster, signed by the nation's first black
elected governor with thanks ``for making this possible.''
   The space next to the poster Greer hopes to fill this year with
a picture of the nation's second black elected governor: his client
and candidate in Georgia, Andrew Young.
   Greer, a 43-year-old political consultant, says Wilder's
election last fall was ``probably one of the most rewarding
experiences politically and personally in my life.''
   A white southerner, Greer adds, ``More than anything else, I was
proud of the South. I always thought the South would lead the way
in race relations.''
   Born and raised in Alabama, Greer designs campaigns for liberal
and moderate Democrats. His consulting firm has $15 million in
billings a year from a Pennsylvania Avenue office overlooking the
Potomac River.
   Greer is widely regarded as the hot consultant this campaign
season. In part, that's on the strength of Wilder's 1989 campaign:
its groundbreaking use of abortion rights as an issue, and tough,
rapid responses that defused his opponent's attacks.
   ``It was brilliant,'' said Republican consultant Roger Stone.
``He sold abortion as a conservative position.''
   Wilder may have won only narrowly, but a win is a win, and
others already are copying his methods.
   As a result, Greer finds himself at the center of the two most
significant political developments of the post-Reagan era: the
election of blacks to statewide office and the power of abortion as
an issue.
   Another Republican consultant, Eddie Mahe, also praised Greer's
work for Wilder but cautioned that Greer may be following a risky
course. ``He clearly believes the future is pro-choice,'' Mahe
said. ``He's putting all his chips on that.''
   Greer gained the notice of his colleagues in 1986, when three
Democratic Senate challengers he was handling each won upsets:
Brock Adams in Washington, Kent Conrad in North Dakota and Wyche
Fowler in Georgia.
   He'd worked for some losers: Fred Harris's 1976 presidential
campaign; Walter Mondale's in 1984. In between, he was the Labor
Department's spokesman in the Carter administration.
   His firm, Greer, Margolis, Mitchell and Associates, also helped
democrtic forces in a 1988 plebiscite in Chile that defeated Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Greer has another important client: the National Abortion Rights
Action League.
   On the day last summer when the Supreme Court ruled that states
could impose some limits on abortion, Greer had TV ads ready. That
night, NARAL began airing them in selected cities, trumpeting
abortion rights as the issue to come.
   The work coincided with Wilder's decision to base his campaign
in large part on abortion rights. Before, candidates who supported
abortion rights had done their best to avoid public debate,
regarding the influence of abortion opponents as too great.
   Greer's clients this year include Young, the former mayor of
Atlanta and veteran of the civil rights struggle who is running in
the Democratic primary for governor of Georgia.
   Young faces longer odds that did Wilder, Greer acknowledges. One
big reason is that Georgia law requires a candidate to have 50
percent of the vote in a primary or runoff to secure the nomination
_ long an obstacle for blacks in southern states.
   His other candidates this year include Senate challenger Harvey
Sloane in Kentucky, Montana Sen. Max Baucus and Paul Hubbert, a
candidate for governor in Alabama.
   What Greer has done so far, and his clients hope he will
continue, is to find a way to victory for Democrats whom some might
conclude were more liberal than the voters electing them.
   More ``progressive,'' Greer prefers.
   ``That is what we do,'' he said. ``I think we do it fairly well.
It's what I grew up with in Alabama, in terms of the legacy of
Franklin Roosevelt and the grassroots populism of southerners.''
   One measure of Greer's success came recently in Kentucky.
Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's re-election campaign went on the
attack _ not against Sloane, the challenger, but Greer, the
consultant, calling him a master of misleading advertising.
   Earlier, Sloane had switched positions and now supports abortion
rights. Greer says he didn't force or prompt the change.
   ``I don't have a litmus test,'' Greer said. ``I let them make
that decision.''
   In Wilder's campaign, Greer designed ads that presented abortion
as an issue of civil liberties _ a question of who decides, the
government or the woman. Greer used lots of waving flags and
pictures of Virginia's Thomas Jefferson.
   Greer says it was his success with Fowler's Georgia campaign,
not Wilder's, that prompted Young to hire him.
   Already, though, there are echoes of Wilder's approach in
Young's campaign.
   Young, announcing his candidacy, said abortion is a woman's
decision. ``I would rather trust the women of Georgia,'' Young
said, sounding a lot like Doug Wilder's ``I trust the women of
Virginia.''
   Framed that way, Greer argues, support for legal abortions is a
powerful wedge that Democrats can use to divide Republicans and win
back voters who were attracted to the GOP on economic issues.
   Republicans dismiss that as wishful thinking. But Greer argues
it goes even further, too, in symbolism.
   ``It's a very much an age issue,'' he said. ``That's why Lee
Atwater (the Republican naitonal chairman) is scrambling.''
   ``I think the Democratic Party is perfectly positioned to raise
the issue and use it to win back younger voters,'' he said. ``It
symbolizes compassion, concern about day care, issues of concern to
working families. ... The question is what the Republicans do.
Right now, they're positioned on the wrong side of the issue, the
wrong side of history.''

   Parched for Perrier? The U.S. importer of the
sparkling water that became a status symbol in the 1980s and the
object of a worldwide contamination recall to start the 1990s says
relief is a month or more away.
   Newly bottled Perrier bearing a special marking is being shipped
for the first time since last month's recall, Source Perrier SA
officials said Tuesday.
   Meantime, Perrier Group of America plans to launch a $25 million
marketing campaign starting today with advertisements in 22
newspapers in an effort to keep the brand's name before the public
during shipment and to rebuild sales of what had been the
top-selling imported bottled water once it arrives.
   The new bottles are expected to reach shelves in the eastern
United States early next month and the rest of the country within
three months.
   They will carry the mark ``Nouvelle Production'' on the label to
distinguish them from the 160 million bottles pulled off the market
last month.
   Source Perrier said Tuesday in Paris that shipments to
distributors resume today. But Perrier Group officials said it will
take until early April for the bottles to travel overseas, pass
through customs and be distributed to the more than 1 million U.S.
outlets from supermarkets to bars where Perrier is sold.
   ``Perrier. Worth Waiting For'' is the theme of ads slated to
appear today in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and 20 major
market newspapers.
   Perrier also plans a series of humorous radio ads in the 15
largest U.S. markets, featuring actors posing as newscasters for
the Perrier News Network reporting on Perrier ``sightings.''
   In one ad, fictional correspondent Jill Purity interviews a man
who had spotted a bottle of Perrier. Jill notes the bottle is
missing, and the man explains that Elvis Presley came and drank it.
   Ronald V. Davis, president and chief executive of Greenwich,
Conn.-based Perrier Group, told reporters at the French consulate
that humor was appropriate because ``no one was hurt'' and no
health risk was posed by the contamination incident.
   Perrier was recalled Feb. 9 in the United States after traces of
benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, were found in some Perrier
bottles. The recall was broadened five days later to all 160
million bottles in 120 countries when contaminated bottles showed
up in several other countries.
   Company officials claim the benzene, a naturally occurring gas
that dissolves in water, entered Perrier's bottling line when
workers failed to replace a filter used to screen impurities from
the carbon dioxide gas that is mixed with the water to provide more
fizz.
   They said new quality control procedures have been installed at
the plant in Vergeze, including double filtration of the gas and
more careful monitoring.
   Perrier should start appearing on shelves in New York in early
April, Davis said, and across the country within three months. He
said it may take until the end of the summer to get all Perrier
varieties back in full distribution.
   An ad campaign to be used after the relaunch is being developed
by Hal Riney &amp; Partners, a San Francisco-based ad agency that
created the old ``It's perfect. It's Perrier'' campaign. Davis said
no decisions have been made on using that slogan again.
   Hellen Berry, market research director for the industry
consultant Beverage Marketing Corp., said, ``I suspect the consumer
will come back to them.''
   Perrier's Davis said consumer surveys the company has taken
indicate 95 percent of Perrier users feel the company acted
responsibly in ordering the recall and 84 percent plan to purchase
it in the future.
   He said he could not estimate the costs of the recall in the
United States.
   But he said the Perrier brand would have sold about $30 million
in the months that it will be off the shelf or in limited supply.
Offsetting that, however, would be gains in sales of Perrier
Group's other brands, including Arrowhead, Poland Spring and
Calistoga.
   Davis said at least 50 percent of Perrier brand's shelf space in
major markets is being filled by other Perrier Group brands.
   The Perrier brand was the third best-selling bottled water brand
and the top-selling imported water in the United States in 1988,
accounting for about 5.7 percent of the $2.2 billion in
industrywide sales, according to Beverage Marketing.
   Davis said the Perrier brand accounted for about $119 million in
sales in 1989, or about 19 percent of Perrier Group's estimated
$640 million in sales.

   Didn't like new Coke? Try Coke II. The taste
promises to be the same.
   The Coca-Cola Co., which learned the hard way about consumer
loyalty when it changed the formula of Coke five years ago,
apparently isn't worried about tinkering with the product that
replaced it.
   The company said Tuesday it will try changing the name of new
Coke to Coke II in an attempt to bolster sales of the product that
in 1985 replaced the world's best-selling soft drink and sparked a
consumer revolt.
   Randy Donaldson, spokesman for Atlanta-based Coke, said the
formula of new Coke will not be altered and that no changes are
planned for Coca-Cola Classic, the name for the restored original
formula.
   Donaldson said Coke II will be test marketed initially in one
city, which he would not identify.
   ``After five years, new Coke is no longer new, though it's still
called new Coke,'' he said. ``We just want to make it easier to
distinguish between Coke II and Coke Classic.''
   Soft drink industry analysts speculated that if the change to
Coke II is adopted, the brand name Coca-Cola could be returned to
the best-selling Coke Classic. Coke officials denied such a name
change was being considered.
   Jesse Meyers, who publishes the Greenwich, Conn., industry
newsletter Beverage Digest, said the Coke II test meant Coca-Cola
was ``taking off the gloves'' in its cola war with rival Pepsi Cola.
   ``They've had a namby-pamby approach to new Coke vs. Pepsi,''
Meyers said. ``They're going from namby-pamby to the machine guns.''
   Recent Coke advertising has pitted diet Coke, rather than the
sugared new Coke or Coca-Cola Classic, against Pepsi. Meyers said
the Coke II test indicates a plan to match the newer product
against Pepsi Cola.
   Meyers said the proposed packaging for Coke II has a red, white
and blue design with blue lettering that closely resembles that of
Pepsi. But Donaldson said that unlike Pepsi the Coke II can has a
red background with white letters and a blue outline.
   Coca-Cola announced in April 1985 that after extensive taste
tests it was changing the formula of Coke, the world's best-selling
soft drink. Consumer reaction was so strong against the new product
that the company two months later apologized and brought back the
original formula under the name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Coke Classic regained the position as the No. 1 soft drink. The
sweeter-tasting new Coke also remained, but its market share now is
1.4 percent compared to Coke Classic's 20 percent.
   Second-ranked Pepsi had an 18.3 percent market share, according
to Beverage Digest's 1989 year-end figures.
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink industry for
PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco, said the Coke II label, if
chosen, would remove the perception that new Coke is a failure.
   ``You don't want something called Coca-Cola that doesn't work,
so you call it Coke II,'' Goldman said. ``I think it's not such a
bad thing to do. The name of the game is Coca-Cola.''
   Meyers said the proposed changes could lead the company to
change Coke Classic back to Coca-Cola. ``The name Coke Classic may
be on the way out,'' he said.
   Donaldson said the change to Coke II would not leave the company
without a product called simply Coca-Cola. He said the company had
several products incorporating the name.
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Coke's so-called
``megabrand'' concept could backfire.
   ``It raises some questions in our minds. ... At what point does
this megabrand confuse consumers?'' MacKenzie said. ``How does the
consumer keep track?''
   Pepsi has maintained that new Coke was an attempt to make a
drink that tastes more like Pepsi Cola. ``Whether it's Coke II or
new new Coke, it's another validation of Coke's interest in the
great taste of Pepsi,'' MacKenzie said from Pepsi headquarters in
Purchase, N.Y.

<HEAD>Inflation in Peru: What Once Bought Truck Now Buys Cigarettes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report and on general news wires</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Their currency is named for the sun, but with
inflation of nearly 3,000 percent last year, Peruvians got little
warmth from it.
   ``The first truck I bought, 15 years ago, cost me 10 million
soles; now that won't even buy me a pack of cigarettes,'' said
Miguel Guzman, who owns a trucking company in Lima.
   Guzman quoted prices in the old currency, the sol _ Spanish for
sun.
   In 1986, when the sol had fallen to 14,000 to the dollar, the
government lopped off three zeros and renamed it the inti _ sun in
Quechua, the Indian language spoken by nearly half the population.
   Four years later, a dollar buys 14,000 intis, which means it
would buy 14 million soles if they were still around.
   To Peruvians, like nearly everyone else, jokes are spiritual
life preservers against disaster. The latest one in Lima is that
the government will chop off three zeros again and call its money
the lupaca _ sun in Aymara, Peru's second major Indian language.
   The inflation rate for the past year, which meant prices ended
the year 30 times higher on average than 12 months earlier, was
surpassed only by Argentina's 4,924 percent.
   Doris Mandujano, 27, one of three daughters in a working-class
family of 16, including grandchildren, says the last year has
brought fundamental changes in the way they live.
   ``Sometimes at dinner there isn't enough food to go around,''
she said. ``We used to have milk and marmalade for breakfast; now
it's bread and oatmeal. ``We've given up trying to provide clothing
and medicine for everyone.''
   Her family is squeezed into a three-bedroom, cement-block house
Miss Mandujano's father built in Villa El Salvador, a shantytown on
the outskirts of Lima.
   Miss Mandujano's parents and seven of the children, including
herself, have jobs and contribute to meeting the family's needs.
She has the additional job of trying to make and follow a budget.
   ``Our pay doesn't keep up with prices,'' she said. ``Sometimes
by the fourth day of the month, we've already spent what was
budgeted for two weeks, and so the crisis begins.''
   Most economists blame government policies that favored
consumption over production while creating a huge deficit that fed
inflation.
   They say populist President Alan Garcia's administration has
subsidized basic goods and services to the point of bankrupting the
very state companies that provide the services.
   A gallon of gasoline costs the equivalent of only 40 cents, but
the state oil company, Petroperu, is on the verge of bankruptcy.
   Electricity and water are among the world's cheapest, but both
are rationed to Lima's 7 milliion people, largely because of the
dilapidated systems. Some parts of the city have been without water
for weeks.
   Ernesto Amans, president of the state water company, said nearly
half the water leaving treatment plants was lost through leaking
underground mains and the company could not afford the $18 million
needed for repairs.
   While subsidized prices remain low, food and clothing rose more
than 2,500 percent last year, entertainment soared more than 10,000
percent and education nearly 20,000 percent, according to official
statistics.
   The magazine Analisis Laboral predicts that by the time Garcia
leaves office July 28, accumulated inflation during his five-year
term will reach 1,383,120 percent.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is favored to win the April 8
presidential election as the candidate of a center-right coalition.
He has pledged to reduce annual inflation to 10 percent within a
year, but says it will demand great sacrifice.
   After five years of Garcia, who campaigned as ``the president of
hope'' and won by a landslide, many Peruvians are skeptical of
politicians' promises.
   ``All that's left to believe in is ourselves,'' Miss Mandujano
said.

   Eastern Airlines has asked a federal bankruptcy
judge to accelerate approval of a $280 million payment by its
parent Texas Air Corp. to settle claims that Texas Air had drained
assets from Eastern.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said Tuesday the airline made the
request because news reports about the settlement had wrongly
suggested Eastern was plundered and duped by Texas Air, creating a
bad image in the industry and flying public.
   Bakes told a news conference that quick approval by the court
would help clarify the settlement.
   A report by court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro filed last
week suggested Texas Air had victimized Eastern by underpaying for
the airline and some assets by hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Eastern and Texas air denounced the report, partly because it
appeared to vindicate longstanding claims by Eastern unions, which
struck the airline last March. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection
a few days later.
   The pilots and flight attendants quit the strike in November but
union hostility to Eastern and Texas Air remains strong.
   In response to Eastern's request for the accelerated settlement
with Texas Air, Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Don Skiados
said: ``We're all for that. We know their arguments can't hold up
under the light of day.''
   A hearing on the settlement has been set for April 6 before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York. Normally, approval
wouldn't occur until Eastern's final bankruptcy reorganization plan
was confirmed by the court.
   Shapiro disclosed the settlement last Thursday, the same day he
filed with the court his extensive report on financial dealings
between Texas Air, Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Bakes said the report had left ``a most, most unfortunate
impression'' that could negatively affect Eastern's relationships
with travel agents, suppliers and the flying public.
   He said the settlement between Texas Air and Shapiro has been
misinterpreted by the news media as an admission of wrongdoing by
Texas Air for the asset purchases. Texas Air agreed to make the
payment to Eastern only to bolster the airline, he said.
   Bakes was accompanied by five outside directors of Eastern, who
each made brief statements reinforcing the company's position.
   ``The report disturbed me as a director and even more so as a
lawyer,'' said Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr. ``To imply, as the report
does, that we (Eastern directors) sort of rubber-stamped these
actions is erroneous.''
   In a similar move Monday, Shapiro told congressional leaders his
report had been misinterpreted by the media as a finding that Texas
Air was liable for the money.
   ``I did not find that Texas Air had improperly diverted assets
from Eastern,'' Shapiro wrote in a letter to House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel. ``Instead, I
set forth the grounds on which such a claim could be asserted.''
   ``The settlement is not an admission of liability by Texas
Air,'' the letter read. ``Rather, it is an agreement between Texas
Air and the examiner as to what is needed to assure the economic
viability of Eastern Airlines.''

<HEAD>Securities Executive Says Letting Drexel Fail Was Right</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a securities industry group says
government regulators were right in not stepping in to save Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Investment banker Robert N. Downey told a Senate panel Tuesday
that Drexel's failure ``reflects how self-reliant the industry is''
compared to the multibillion-dollar government bailout of the
savings and loan industry.
   Downey told the finance subcommittee of the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that ``when Drexel no longer
could stand on its own, it collapsed. The government did not rush
in to save it, nor should it have.''
   Drexel's parent company, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.,
filed for bankruptcy code protection from creditors last month
after defaulting on $100 million in short-term loans and failing to
secure additional financing.
   Drexel Group listed more than 2,000 creditors and nearly $3
billion in liabilities.
   Drexel's fall marked the largest securities industry bankruptcy
filing ever and one of the first exceptions to a long-held, but
unwritten, regulatory policy that some institutions are just to big
to be allowed to fail.
   Downey, a partner in the investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co., put in a plug for a plan _ still being developed by the SIA
_ to allow commercial banking organizations to enter the securities
industry and securities firms to enter consumer banking.
   He said the plan would stand ``without forcing the deposit
insurance system to shoulder the securities risks and without
triggering `too-big-to-fail''' status that led to the saving and
loan bailout.
   Downey was among a panel of securities industry leaders
testifying about the health and future of their industry in the
wake of Drexel's demise, the collapse of the junk bond market and a
stock market plunge last October.
   The panelists included John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon
Inc.; Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Dean Witter Financial Services
Group; and W. Lucas Simons Jr., managing partner of J.C. Bradford &amp;
Co. of Nashville, Tenn.
   All four called for a single federal agency to regulate all
aspects of the securities industry rather than the current division
of power now among the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and
Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   While Gutfreund wasn't specific, the others said the SEC should
take up the super-regulator role.
   The SEC should then ``regulate both equity and stock index
futures markets, with a recommendation that its first order of
business be devoted to rationalizing margin requirements,'' said
Simons of J.C. Bradford, an investment banking partnership
concentrating on the Southeast.
   Margins, the amount of money investors must put down to buy
securities or futures contracts on credit, are much lower in the
futures industry than in stocks. Critics say that encourages
speculation in stock options through index arbitrage, leading to
sharp ups and downs in stock prices.

<TEXT>
   Regulating a securities firm like Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. without financial data on its parent company
is like being a doctor who can only examine part of the body, the
head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden used a budget hearing before the
commerce subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on
Tuesday as an opportunity to lobby for additional authority.
   Questioned about the recent collapse of Drexel, Breeden said one
difficulty for the SEC was lack of data about the parent holding
company, which filed for bankruptcy code protection last month.
   The SEC regulates broker-dealers but not their parent companies,
which don't have to disclose their financial status.
   Legislation pending in both the House and Senate would give the
SEC access to such financial data.
   Breeden likened the limitations on such information to being a
physician ``who can only look at the right arm from the elbow to
the wrist. It's very unrealistic.''
   The Bush administration is seeking $192.4 million for the SEC in
1991, a 14 percent increase over the 1990 appropriation of $168.7
million.
   Breeden noted that Congress should be mindful that SEC revenue
production through filing fees ``have significantly exceeded its
appropriations.''
   He pointed out that in 1989, while receiving only $142.6 million
in appropriations, the SEC generated $213.8 million in fees.

   The lead creditor to Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc. withdrew a request for a court-appointed examiner in the
bankruptcy case as the two sides neared a deal on who will manage
dissolution of the Wall Street firm.
   The firm and its creditors negotiated over a proposal to allow a
triumvirate of Drexel board members to oversee the firm, with input
from creditors, as it liquidates under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The move Tuesday by lead creditor First City Bancorp. of Texas
to withdraw its request for an examiner was a sign the Drexel board
members were likely to continue directing the liquidation.
   Creditors had sought an examiner in the case because of concerns
about the rapid liquidation of billions of dollars in securities
holdings and other assets by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the
brokerage subsidiary.
   The brokerage firm is not subject to bankruptcy court
proceedings but the asset sales, the movement of capital from the
subsidiary to the parent company prior to the collapse and other
links prompted anxious creditors to seek an examiner.
   In a bid to prevent the appointment, which Drexel officials
contended would hamstring the company's day-to-day management,
Drexel asked U.S. District Judge Howard Buschman III to allow three
board members led by Chairman John S.R. Shad to oversee the
dismantling of the parent and all subsidiaries.
   Drexel attorney Alan Miller told Buschman the two sides had made
``considerable progress'' toward resolving the issue. But he said
unanticipated differences arose during Tuesday's negotiations.
   Miller and other attorneys refused to disclose the nature of the
stumbling block.
   Buschman postponed a hearing on the appointment of the Drexel
board members until Friday. Buschman has said such an arrangement
would not require court approval.
   An individual involved in the talks said that under a plan being
discussed, the three-member Drexel team would manage the
liquidation but give creditors ``real input' into the process.
   Drexel already has sold off more than 85 percent of its
portfolio of about $47 billion in securities since the parent filed
for bankruptcy protection from creditors Feb. 13.
   But the firm still is trying to dispose of most of its $1.1
billion in high-yield bonds, which could take months because of a
downturn in the market and the risky financial state of many of the
companies for which Drexel issued and now owns junk bonds.
   The individual, who asked not to be named, said Drexel
management would handle transactions and creditors could attend
senior level meetings and have ``the ability to scream if they see
something they don't like.''
   Responsibilities of the oversight panel would apply to the
parent and the subsidiaries, the individual said. Lawyers said in
court they would continue meeting on the matter.
   The three-member panel consists of Shad, who is a former SEC
chairman; Roderick Hills, a Washington lawyer and former SEC
chairman; and Ralph Saul, a business executive and former American
Stock Exchange president.
   The group was named as an outside oversight committee to Drexel
as part of the firm's agreement with the Securities and Exchange
commission last April settling wideranging securities fraud charges.

   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. lost $23 million in 1989,
its parent General Electric Co. reported in another sign of Wall
Street's troubles.
   The loss at the firm compared with a $46 million profit in 1988.
Like other Wall Street firms, Kidder has suffered because of a
decline in stock market and investment banking activity.
   A General Electric spokesman said Tuesday that Kidder reported
an operating loss of $53 million last year but that its net loss
was lower because of accounting adjustments by GE.
   ``Kidder's financial performance improved in the last half of
the year from the first six months,'' GE said in a statement.
``Kidder's streamlined management team is making progress in a
difficult environment.''
   Kidder is not required to disclose its earnings because it is a
subsidiary company, but figures on its performance were included in
GE's annual report.
   Kidder's $53 million pretax operating loss compared to an
operating profit of $64 million in 1988 and a loss of $23 million
in 1987, when the stock market crash wreaked havoc on the
securities industry.
   Kidder had revenue of $2.9 billion in 1989, up from $2.3 billion
a year earlier. But revenue from investment banking fees and
brokerage commissions declined 17 percent to $518 million last
year, nearly 30 percent lower than in 1987.
   The securities firm was the only segment of GE's business to
show an operating loss last year. Overall, GE had pretax earnings
of $5.7 billion in 1989.
   GE, the electrical products, broadcasting and financial services
company based in Fairchild, Conn., paid $600 million to acquire an
80 percent stake in Kidder in 1986.
   But Kidder has proven costly to GE since its acquisition, above
and beyond its operating losses. About a year after buying Kidder,
GE paid $26 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to
settle insider trading charges involving the firm.
   Kidder underwent a major restructuring shortly after the crash,
laying off employees and cutting expenses. The firm recently has
been focusing its retail brokerage business on wealthy clients and
small companies, rather then all individual investors.
   Kidder has 5,600 employees, down from a peak of 7,500.

   Some heirs to great family fortunes dabble in
art collecting. Others become renowned philanthropists.
   Ola Stillman Rockefeller is posing for underwear ads.
   Rockefeller, 30, is the newest pitchman for Jockey International
Inc. The company unveiled the magazine ad campaign at a news
conference Tuesday with the aid of baseball great Jim Palmer, who
is perhaps the best-known Jockey model.
   Rockefeller, according to material provided by his public
relations agency, has a ``recent penchant for art.'' He has
collaborated on collages with Mark Kostabi, a New York artist who
has mounted public relations stunts to promote his artworks.
   Rockefeller said Jockey came to him with the idea of posing for
the ads.
   ``I kind of hemmed and hawed,'' he said in an interview. ``I
really wanted to do it but then I thought, `Is my grandfather going
to kill me or cut me off or something?' But I eventually decided to
do it. I'm just sort of winging it.''
   He said his grandfather, James Stillman Rockefeller, former
chairman of First National City Bank of New York, opposed the plan
until the younger Rockefeller said he would give the proceeds to
Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital, a family charity.
   ``In some ways I am trying to create my own identity,''
Rockefeller said. ``Sometimes it's hard if you're the son of or
descendant of _ you're expected to play a certain role.''
   Rockefeller said he hopes the exposure he gains through the ads
_ in which he is tastefully garbed in plaid undershorts and a
T-shirt _ will help further his art aspirations.
   Rockefeller, whose great grandfather was a brother to John D.
Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil Co., said he's been
wearing Jockey underwear since he was 14.
   One of Rockefeller's cousins, James Stillman Rockefeller Rose,
said Rockefeller's plan to pose for the ad ``sort of came out
suddenly.''
   ``The only reason the family let him get away with it is that
he's donating the procedes to Sloan-Kettering,'' Rose said in a
telephone interview.
   Several years ago, Rockefeller announced he would launch a line
of men's clothing featuring the family crest. The clothes never
materialized, ``thank God,'' Rose said, adding that the family was
dismayed by the intended use of the crest.
   Rose, 30, described his cousin as the non-traditional member of
an otherwise low-key family.
   Rose, who helps manage a family-run investment company, said
that despite the trust funds _ the total of which dwindles with
each generation _ most members of his generation of the
Rockefellers are employed.
   ``We've have a much stronger work ethic than a lot of our
cousins on the other side of the family do, out of necessity and
training,'' he said.

<HEAD>May Department Stores Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co., one of the nation's
largest retailers, reported a slight fourth-quarter earnings
increase but a mild loss for the year, mostly from the cost of
discarding two discount chains.
   Earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 3 totaled $283 million, or
$2 a share, up 2 percent from $276 million, or $1.88 a share, for
the same period a year earlier.
   The earnings from continuing operations were much brighter,
however, at $283 million vs. $230 million, because last year May
had $46 million in earnings from discontinued operations in the
fourth quarter.
   Revenues for the quarter increased 5 percent to $3.2 billion, up
from $3 billion from the same period a year ago, May said Tuesday.
   May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, operates 14
regional department store chains around the country along with a
national chain of discount shoe stores.
   The company, best-known for its Lord &amp; Taylor stores, is in the
midst of an aggressive expansion plan in an industry that has been
experiencing some difficult times.
   For the year, the company's earnings declined about 6 percent,
primarily because of a $23 million charge for the cost of
discarding discount chains Venture and Caldor.
   Last year the company made $498 million, or $3.52 a share,
compared with $534 million, or $3.62 a share. Revenues in 1989 were
$9.6 billion, up 8 percent from $8.8 billion for the year before.
   May plans to open a record 21 department stores in 1990 and 244
new Payless ShoeSource stores in 1990. The company also will
remodel 29 stores.

<HEAD>De Beers Plans To Split South African Operations From Foreign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. plans to split
its foreign operations from its South African business in an
apparent move to shelter the huge diamond mining company from
political turmoil in South African.
   De Beers said Tuesday the plans were intended to focus attention
on the company's international nature and its true business value.
   ``Basically it's going to lose some, if not all of the discount
of being a South African share,'' said Rob Davies, a mining analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton International in London.
   De Beers also announced its net profit soared 37 percent last
year.
   Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied there were political
reasons for the company's split.
   Speaking at a Johannesburg news conference that was relayed to
London, he said the split would give De Beers better access to
international capital markets; enable shareholders to better
identify earnings, dividends and assets attributable to the South
African and foreign sides of the business; and allow the two sides
to develop their businesses better.
   Analysts said the move would insulate the company _ which in
1989 made 80 percent of its profit from foreign businesses _ from
its South African ties and from moves to end white-minority rule in
that country.
   The African National Congress party has said it would
nationalize South Africa's mines and other major sectors of the
economy, if it comes into power.
   Furthermore, many investors are reluctant to invest in South
African companies because of its government policies of racial
separation. In the United States, government sanctions prohibit
Americans from making fresh investments in South African equities.
   ``It should open up the share to a wider market,'' Davies said
of the De Beers plan.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the plan was linked to Minorco
SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British mining company
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year.
   The bid by Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the
associated Anglo American Corp., was seen as an attempt by South
Africa's Oppenheimer family to diversify its gold and diamond
mining empire further outside South Africa.
   Under the proposed split, De Beers' South African company will
continue to be called De Beers Consolidated Mines. De Beers'
foreign businesses would be grouped under a Swiss company, De Beers
Centenary AG, although both companies will be headed by the same
board of directors.
   De Beers said it would give existing shareholders one share in
Centenary for each De Beers share they own. The two shares will be
tradeable only as a single unit on the nine exchanges where De
Beers shares are traded, the company said.
   De Beers said it would retain a 9.5 percent stake in Centenary.
   John Taylor, an analyst at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co., said, ``Essentially, it's an extremely cheap share.
People were giving it a low rating because of the politics of
investing in South Africa.''
   The split means ``the political risk to a certain extent has
disappeared,'' Taylor said. De Beers can just allow shares in the
companies to trade separately if the situation in South Africa
deteriorates, he said.
   The plan is subject to final approval by South African
regulators, who have approved in principle. It also must be
approved by shareholders. Support already has been given by Anglo
American, which has a 33 percent stake, and De Beers Botswana
Mining Co. (Pty) Ltd., which holds 5 percent.

<HEAD>Pathe to Buy MGM-UA Studios</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co. said today it has
agreed to be acquired by Pathe Communications Corp. for $20 a
share, or about $1 billion.
   Pathe, an international film producer, distributor and
exhibitor, will begin a tender offer for all of MGM-UA's common and
preferred shares within five days, the companies said in a joint
statement.
   The deal is expected to be completed in late June.
   MGM-UA's principal shareholder, Tracinda Corp., has agreed to
tender to Pathe all of its MGM-UA shares, the statement said.
   Pathe, which will operate MGM-UA separately, agreed to put up
$100 million in ``earnest money'' within the next few days. MGM-UA
Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow will retain his position.
   Europe-based Pathe also granted MGM-UA certain distribution
rights and an interest in up to $75 million of net distribution
proceeds of certain motion pictures. Further details were not
disclosed.
   ``We believe that MGM-UA's unique library and strong
distribution capabilities complement Pathe's existing business
worldwide,'' said Giancarlo Parretti, president and chief executive
officer of Pathe.
   ``We are confident the transaction will result in a strong, dual
company structure which will be strongly competitive in the
industry,'' he said.
   Barbakow said the deal allows MGM-UA employees ``to continue
their efforts to build our film, TV and home video operations.''
   He said MGM-UA ``will also benefit from Pathe's control of over
1,000 theater screens in Europe and its ownership of an extensive
library of 1,200 feature films, including Cannon's well-known
library.''
   On Monday, the companies announced that MGM-UA had reached a
five-year deal to distribute films from Pathe. MGM-UA said the deal
would boost the number of major films it releases in theaters to at
least 15 this year.
   MGM-UA virtually shut down its film production efforts for
nearly two years while controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian
looked for a buyer. It has started up its own production again but
has depended largely on distributing movies from independent
production companies like Pathe.
   Australia's Qintex Group outbid Rupert Murdoch's Fox Studio for
MGM-UA last year, but the deal collapsed when Qintex failed to line
up financing. Merger talks with cable TV baron Ted Turner ended in
January, and Kerkorian said he would go back to the business of
making movies.

<HEAD>Sony To Introduce ``Palmtop'' Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Sony Corp. said Wednesday it soon will
begin selling a small keyboardless computer that can read words
written with a special pen on its flat screen.
   ``We consider this an epoch-making product, like the Walkman
tape player,'' a Sony official said.
   Sony officials said the 2.8-pound book-size computer has the
same screen resolution, or clarity of detail, as Apple Computer
Inc.'s Macintosh computer. It comes with built-in software that
displays a row of easily recognizable symbols on the screen like a
Macintosh, and has extensive graphic capabilities.
   ``This is a real computer, but unlike other computers, anyone
can begin using it the minute they take it home,'' said another
Sony official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Instead of a mouse, the hand-operated device that manipulates
the cursor on the screen and executes commands with a push button,
the computer is equipped with a special pen that is used to point
to the desired function diagram on the built-in flat screen, which
folds open to create a writing surface.
   Similar pens that emit a light beam have been used for years
with larger computers. But the Sony computer, named the PalmTop
PCT-500, takes the pen concept a step further.
   In word processing, the pen is used to write text on the screen,
which the computer recognizes through a handwriting recognition
system that uses ``fuzzy logic,'' Sony said.
   The computer is capable of recognizing English letters and more
than 3,500 complex Japanese characters, the company said.
   ``Fuzzy logic'' allows computers to reason more like humans.
Instead of being limited to ``yes or no'' answers, the computer can
process information like ``shorter'' or ``wider.''
   The computer has a 16-bit processor and 320 kilobytes of
built-in RAM memory, which can store about 110 pages of
information, Sony said. Additional memory cards will be available.
   With an optional adaptor, the PCT-500 can send and receive fax
messages to any fax machine, a funtion available on many other
computers, Sony said. The computer also comes with a built-in auto
phone dialer and can digitally record up to eight seconds of sound.
In addition, it has a standard computer interface.
   Sony said the computer will be introduced in Japan on April 1
for 198,000 yen, the equivalent of $1,320 at current exchange rates.
   ``We plan to sell it overseas, but the current software is
written entirely in Japanese, so we need to develop a new software
system for the foreign market,'' an official said.

   The stock market gained ground today, extending
its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.08 to 2,682.88 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
561 up, 371 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market continued to benefit from hopes that
the economy could keep growing at a sluggish pace, avoiding the
recession that many feared might have taken hold by now.
   There are some expectations that that view will be bolstered on
Friday with the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which will provide one of the first gauges of economic
activity in February.
   The data are expected to show an increase of 200,000 to 250,000
in nonfarm payroll employment, compared with a 275,000 gain in
January.
   Brokers said stocks also got a boost Tuesday from a downturn in
open-market interest rates. In today's trading in the market for
U.S. Treasury securities, rates showed only slight and mixed
changes.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up &rsqb; at
62}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up &rsqb; at 41; American Express,
up { at 27}, and Texaco, up &rsqb; at 60&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.37 to 186.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .76 at 359.57.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.25 to
2,676.80.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 2 to 1 on
the NYSE, with 1,026 up, 457 down and 504 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 143.64 million shares, against 140.11
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Rules Taking Effect Two Years After Hawaii Accident</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf, The anti-corrosion ..., to delete extraneous
word `between'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two years after the roof ripped off an
aging Boeing 737 jetliner over Hawaii, the government is imposing
the first set of parts-replacement rules for older planes.
   At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration announced
plans worked out with the aviation industry to require a detailed
cycle of inspections for corrosion in Boeing airliners.
   The final rules announced Tuesday are aimed at correcting
metal-fatigue problems in airliners that have gone through
thousands of takeoffs and landings. They require replacements of
parts and will cost airlines an estimated $142 million over the
next four years.
   The anti-corrosion measures are estimated to cost $38,720 for
each Boeing 737 over the six-year inspection cycle, $80,000 for
each Boeing 727, $80,640 for each Boeing 707 and $188,800 for each
Boeing 747.
   Foreign regulatory agencies generally follow FAA requirements
for U.S.-built planes.
   The rules come as no surprise to the industry, which set up the
task force that proposed them.
   The aging airliner effort was started after the roof of an Aloha
Airlines 737 ripped off at 24,000 feet over Maui, Hawaii, in April
1988. A flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 passengers
were injured. The plane was 19 years old and had made nearly 90,000
flights.
   The accident was caused primarily by metal fatigue, but
corrosion also was found, the FAA said.
   The new fatigue rules, which take effect in 30 days, give
airlines four years to comply with all the requirements and will
immediately affect 115 older, U.S.-registered Boeing aircraft.
   Tony Broderick, FAA regulations chief, said the agency believes
that if the regulations are followed, there will be no need to
retire airliners at a given age.
   Final fatigue rules for McDonnell Douglas airliners are to be
issued in a couple of months, with rules for other airliners to be
issued before the end of the year, Broderick said.
   Corrosion rules also will be proposed for other jetliners, he
said, and will become final after airlines have an opportunity to
comment.
   Broderick said that although most airlines have programs to
detect and repair corrosion, the proposed rules would impose
detailed FAA requirements for inspections of 19 specific areas of
each airliner.
   Under the proposal, inspections would have to be performed most
often under lavatories and galleys, where corrosive liquids might
collect, and in wheel wells.
   Broderick said the program could pose ``a relatively big
burden'' on some small airlines, but that if carriers find
themselves overburdened it probably means they have not been
conducting adequate corrosion inspections on their own.
   The goal is for each airline to set up a program that will find
only harmless corrosion that can be corrected quickly with each
inspection.
   More serious corrosion, which would require repair or
replacement of parts or which might endanger the safety of the
airliner, would have to be reported to the manufacturer.
   The FAA has based its rules on Boeing service bulletins and the
experiences of domestic and foreign airliners that participated in
the task force.

   Singapore Airlines has decided to fit the 30
Boeing 747-400 and 20 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft it is buying
with American-made Pratt &amp; Whitney engines worth about $2.2
billion, the company said Wednesday.
   In a news release, the airline said it spent four months
evaluating three engines, including General Electric CF6-80c2BIF
and Rolls Royce RB211-524H, before deciding on the Pratt &amp; Whitney
PW 4056 for the Boeing 747-400.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney engines are made by United Technologies Corp. of
Hartford, Conn.
   For the MD-11s it evaluated General Electric CF6-80C2DIF and
Rolls Royce Trent 650 before selecting the PW 4460, the airline
said.
   The deal, which includes spare engines, covers 234 engines, 152
for the B747-400 and 82 for the MD-11. The total cost of the
engines amounts to $2.2 billion and was included in the estimated
outlay of $8.6 billion for the aircraft orders announced in
January, the company said.
   The PW 4056 is the same engine the airline uses on its existing
B747-400s, five of which are in service, with another 15 to be
delivered by 1993, the release said.

<HEAD>US Could Lose Lead in Computer Software to Other Countries, Study
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 10 grafs new to include testimony; Picks up 8th graf pvs,
The congressional study.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has 70 percent of the
world's computer software market but could lose its lead without
better legal protection as other countries develop their software,
a congressional study says.
   With continued innovation, the United States can keep outshining
its foreign competitors, the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment said in a study released today.
   It said intellectual property protection encourages innovation
by providing incentives for creation and security for investors.
   Last year, software and related services were a $60 billion
industry in the United States. Software refers to sets of
instructions for computers, whether they are stored in punched
cards, magnetic tape, disks, or on chips. The term can encompass
data as well as programs.
   Mitchell D. Kapor, the creator of Lotus 1-2-3, told a House
subcommittee that over-protection of software ``is as pernicious as
under-protection in its stifling effects on innovation.''
   He said his industry has made an ``unsteady but stubborn march''
to extend copyright protection of computer software. But, he said,
it is possible to go too far.
   ``I honestly believe that this industry isn't mature enough to
cope with a barrage of new laws,'' Kapor said. ``Congress could
help both the software industry and its customers if, when it
passes laws their legislative histories tell the courts that, when
they consider a copyright case, they should err on the side of
innovation over protection.''
   The Software Publishers Association, a worldwide trade
association representing 575 microcomputer software developers and
publishers, said in a statement that patent protection for their
product is not universally endorsed, partly because publishers are
concerned that the government's Patent and Trademark Office can't
adequately review applications.
   ``Publishers believe that the PTO is understaffed, underfunded,
and so is not equipped to evaluate most software patent
applications in a timely and effective fashion,'' the association
said.
   There is fear of foreign competition, especially from the
Japanese, who reportedly plan to spend $125 billion over 10 years
for programming research and development _ especially in the field
of artificial intelligence, where the goal is to make computers
think more like humans.
   The congressional study said there are basic questions about
providing too much, as well as too little, legal protection for
software.
   New technologies have long challenged existing protections, but
usually accommodations are made.
   ``For instance, the first copyright statute dealt only with
maps, charts and books, but copyright has been able to deal with
hard questions posed by works like engravings, musical
compositions, photographs,'' the study said.
   With software, however, the items needing protection are not
clear.
   As writing and checking lines of program instructions _
so-called code _ becomes more automated, some software producers
want to protect ``the logic and idea'' of a program, not just the
effort required to write the code and check it. Others worry that
computer-aided software development will make copying easier to
disguise.
   The study says drawing the line between derivative works and new
creations, and determining authorship, is likely to become more
difficult.
   But it also points out that lawyers and many in the software
industry believe existing copyrights and patents adequately protect
software.
   ``At the same time that some are calling for major revisions in
software protection,'' says the study, ``others are arguing that
the current system is not broken and does not need fixing _ or, at
least, can be fine-tuned within the existing framework.''

   President Bush promised today to work toward
helping the U.S. electronics industry ``regain and retain'' its
lost leadership in world markets.
   The president, speaking to the American Electronics Association,
proposed no new trade strategies but said congressional enactment
of many of his lanquishing initiatives would help make U.S.
high-tech goods more competitive.
   Without passage of his proposed reduction in the capital gains
tax rate, ``every business in America _ of every size _ is at a
competitive disadvantage abroad,'' Bush said in prepared remarks.
   He said some of the nation's biggest competitors, including
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and West Germany, did not tax capital
gains at all. ``So we're fighting hard, with your continued
support, for that crucial tax cut,'' he said.
   Capital gains are the income from the sale of stocks, real
estate and other assets. It is currently taxed at the same rate as
other income _ up to 33 percent. Bush's proposal would lower the
rate, in effect, to about 19.5 percent.
   ``We intend to work with you _ closely, constantly and
consistently _ to see that American electronics and technologies
regain and retain a pre-eminent position in world markets,'' Bush
told the trade organization that represents U.S. chip manufacturers.
   He praised the industry for becoming ``the nation's largest
manufacturing employer, creating jobs for over 2.5 million
Americans.''
   The president also said he was optimistic that his meeting last
weekend in California with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
would help pry open more markets in Japan.
   He said he and Kaifu ``specifically discussed satellites and
telecommunications, super computers, forest products
and...semiconductors. I hope, on the basis of our talks, that Japan
will be moving toward early resolution of these problem areas.''
   There has been a longstandng trade dispute between the United
States and Japan over semiconductors, or computer chips, that
resulted in temporary sanctions against Japan in 1987 for
``dumping'' chips in U.S. markets _ deliberately selling chips at
below-market prices.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said today that 97.3
percent of the outstanding shares of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.'s
stock have been tendered under the Atlanta company's $5 billion
takeover plan.
   Georgia-Pacific said 53.8 million shares of Great Northern stock
were tendered as of midnight Tuesday, the deadline for the
$65.75-a-share tender offer.
   ``Georgia-Pacific intends to complete the acquisition of Great
Northern as soon as practicable by merging NM Acquisition into
Great Northern in accordance with the merger agreement,'' Georgia
Pacific said in a statement.
   Great Northern's management agreed last month to the unsolicited
buyout after 3{ months of bitter resistance to the deal.
   The merger is expected to result in the nation's largest forest
products company. Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific had $10 billion in
sales last year, while Great Northern, headquartered in Norwalk,
Conn., had $4 billion in sales.

   Futures prices for soybeans and grains were
mainly lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Rainy weather favorable to the winter wheat crop was continuing
to depress wheat futures, according to analysts.
   They said corn was trading in a narrow range due to a lack of
news concerning that commodity.
   Soybean prices were reacting to an increase in farmer selling
overnight, traders said.
   In early dealings, wheat was { cent lower to { cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.80} a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1\ cents lower, with March at $2.43} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to \ cent higher, with March at $1.46 a bushel; and
soybeans were { cent to 1{ cents lower, with March at $5.77 a

   Livestock and meat prices were steady to higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were .03 cent higher to .10 cent lower, with the

   The stock market headed higher today, extending
its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 112 points from Feb.
24 through Tuesday's close, rose 8.34 to 2,685.14 by 11 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
684 up, 497 down and 551 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 57.90 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the market continued to benefit from hopes that
the economy could keep growing at a sluggish pace, avoiding the
recession that many feared might have taken hold by now.
   There are some expectations that that view will be bolstered on
Friday with the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which will provide one of the first gauges of economic
activity in February.
   The data are expected to show an increase of 200,000 to 250,000
in nonfarm payroll employment, compared with a 275,000 gain in
January.
   Brokers said stocks also got a boost Tuesday from a downturn in
open-market interest rates. In today's trading in the market for
U.S. Treasury securities, rates showed only slight and mixed
changes.
   MGM-UA Communications jumped 3~ to 17~ on word of a $20-a-share

<HEAD>DINKs Have Troubles Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the time comes for doling out financial
encouragement and moral support, DINKs often must wait at the end
of the line.
   The millions of modern American households nicknamed for their
double-income, no-kids status are widely presumed to be doing just
fine on their own, with economic advantages few others enjoy.
   Social commentators have gone so far as to portray DINKs as
egomaniacs hooked on instant gratification. If a layoff or other
reversal hits either half of a DINK partnership, sympathy may be
slow in coming, even from close friends and relatives.
   The accuracy of such generalizations, of course, varies widely
from one two-income, zero-dependent living unit to the next.
   Even in households where the cash flow never seems to stop, say
experts in matters of personal finance, DINKs face problems of
money management and planning that are just about unique to their
species.
   ``While two incomes can give couples a financial edge, that edge
is often blunted by poor planning,'' says Candace E. Trunzo in her
book Financial Planning For The Two-Career Family, recently
published under the auspices of John Hancock Financial Services.
   ``Not only financial stability but family stability can suffer
if there is no management or compromise in a two-career family.''
   The steady flow of multiple paychecks in a DINK household can
overcome any impulse to develop disciplined habits or plan for the
future, making such regimens harder and harder to adopt and adjust
to with the passage of time.
   If a two-career family has something of a cushion against a
disruption in the life of either worker, it also may be doubly
exposed to the risk of changing economic circumstances.
   With such considerations in mind, many advisers urge DINKs to
save a greater percentage of their income than others might deem
prudent _ as much as 25 percent, or even more.
   ``Sock it away before you spend it on restaurants, clothes and
cars,'' says John Erb at the accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   Society's presumption that DINKs are more capable than most of
bearing the cost of government shows up clearly in the tax code.
``Because they lack most of the deductions that reduce taxable
income, they stand virtually defenseless before the tax man,'' Erb
observes.
   To reduce the tax bite, Erb recommends that DINKS make the
maximum contributions possible to such things as individual
retirement accounts and employer-sponsored retirement savings
programs.
   He also suggests that when they save, they give extra emphasis
to growth investments such as stocks and mutual funds, seeking out
long-term capital gains over current income from their nest eggs.
   Tax rates are now the same for both capital gains and dividend
and interest income. But tax bills on capital gains don't arise
until you decide to sell an investment.
   For unmarried DINKs, planning is complicated by questions of
what rights lawmakers, the courts and society are willing to accord
them _ for example, on the death of either partner in the household.
   Married couples are urged to consider special strategies as
well. For instance, they may be prime candidates to save on tax
deductions for medical or miscellaneous expenses by filing their
returns separately rather than jointly.
   Advisers also suggest that two-career families give their
employee benefit programs close scrutiny to eliminate overlaps.
   When it comes to things like insurance, Trunzo writes, the goal
is to be ``adequately but not overly insured, particularly if you
are paying for benefits from your own pockets.''

   Groups of senators worked behind the scenes
today to toughen a compromise clean air bill, trying to craft
amendments that would place additional pollution controls on
automobiles and industry.
   Floor debate on the clean air bill moved ahead slowly with
several controversial amendments _ including the tighter controls
on automobile emissions _ yet to come up for consideration.
   Both Senate leaders and the Bush administration were trying to
keep intact a compromise bill fashioned during three weeks of
closed-door bargaining, opposing amendments that would either
weaken or strenthen the legislation.
   In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and
power subcommittee, which had planned later today to consider a
proposal to help Midwest utilities pay for costly sulfur dioxide
emission controls, put off its hearing until Thursday.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the House energy and
power subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has argued
for a special fee to help the Midwest utilities. Congressional
sources said it was unclear whether Sharp had enough votes, even in
his subcommittee, to tack onsuch a provision.
   A cost-sharing fee has been opposed by the Bush administration
as well as many lawmakers from areas where utilities already have
relatively clean-burning electric power plants. The Senate bill
contains no such provision, although some allowances to help the
Midwest are included.
   In the Senate, a number of noncontroversial amendments were
approved by a voice vote Tuesday and today.
   The House and Senate clean air measures call for tougher
controls on smog-causing pollution from automobiles and industrial
sources, curbs on toxic chemical releases by industry and, for the
first time, cuts in acid rain pollutants from coal-fired utility
plants.
   The House bill remains in committee. Last week a Senate
compromise with the Bush administration sent that body's measure to
the floor for debate.
   For most of Tuesday, the Senate debated an amendment brought by
Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho to change the toxic chemical section of
the bill. But by late afternoon the proposal was withdrawn, and the
Senate later approved by voice vote a number of noncontroversial
amendments.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, complained that
senators were slow in producing amendments and vowed to keep the
legislation on the floor ``until we see some progress'' even if it
means working into the weekend.
   ``We can't permit legislation of this magnitude not to proceed
because no senator wants to come forward with an amendment,''
Mitchell declared in an almost empty Senate chamber late Tuesday.
   Despite the lack of floor action, there was considerable
activity behind the scenes. Various groups of senators worked on
proposed amendments, including one to strengthen auto pollution
controls by reinstating automatic enactment of a second round of
tailpipe controls.
   Another would reinstate a requirement that automakers improve
the fuel economy of their car fleets and control carbon dioxide
emissions.
   Both provisions were taken out of the bill during private
negotiations with the Bush administration, which considered them
too expensive to the auto industry.

   Greyhound says it is ``slowly but surely''
restoring service at the strikebound bus company with replacement
drivers and breakaway union members.
   Greyhound Lines Inc., America's only nationwide bus system, said
today its ridership Tuesday was 37.1 percent of the number carreid
on the same day last year, an increase from Monday's 33.8 percent
and Friday's 30 percent.
   ``The trend is up. There is no erosion in our service,'' said
George Gravley, a spokesman for GLI Holdings, parent company of
Greyhound. ``It's getting better slowly but surely.''
   The company's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and
maintenance workers are on strike. The union has asked for new
talks, but none are scheduled, although the chief negotiators spoke
briefly by telephone Tuesday.
   The union issued a bulletin to its members Tuesday, urging them
to use their cars to take blood to hospitals where supplies may
have been disrupted by the strike.
   But Red Cross officials said they were unaware of any serious
disruptions, although blood usually delivered by bus was being
carried by alternate transportation in some cases.
   The company has been operating with about 700 replacement
drivers plus what it says are 350 union members who crossed picket
lines. Union officials said their own checks show that only 95
union drivers have been behind the wheel.
   Gravley said the replacement drivers are being paid under the
contract terms the strikers rejected.
   The contract does not change base pay but allows drivers to
reach higher pay levels sooner by setting up a system based on
experience rather than seniority, Gravley said. It also rewards
accident-free driving, he said.
   The union has rejected pay increases linked to productivity.
Greyhound drivers made an average of $24,743 last year, according
to the company.

<HEAD>Reports: Feds Decide To Sell SASA To First Gibraltar Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Resolution Trust Corp. has
decided to sell San Antonio Savings Association to Houston-based
First Gibraltar Bank, possibly as early as Friday, according to
published reports today.
   Resolution Trust, the federal agency that took over the failed
thrift last year, also reportedly adopted a policy ensuring San
Antonio Savings independent operation at least until the RTC
reviews the plan that formed First Gibraltar.
   A decision to sell the savings and loan to First Gibraltar was
made Tuesday afternoon in Washington, and First Gibraltar officials
were notified soon afterward, the San Antonio Light and Dallas
Times Herald reported in today's editions.
   RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos, First Gibraltar spokeswoman Ruth
Lack and SASA chairman W.W. ``Bo'' McAllister III all declined to
comment on whether an agreement had been reached.
   SASA, one of several was seized on March 2, 1989 and at that
time had $2.6 billion in assets and $1.9 billion in deposits. SASA
was offered for sale in the RTC's initial package of Aug. 30, 1989.
As of Sept. 30, SASA had total assets of $2.31 billion and a
negative net worth of $415.07 million.
   The sale is expected to include at least $415 million in federal
assistance to eliminate the negative net worth. Specific terms of
First Gibraltar's deal could not be determined late Tuesday.
   The sale was not expected to affect the thrift's customers, and
SASA would remain open for business as usual.
   Sources close to several bidding groups confirmed that First
Gibraltar Bank, which actually operates as a savings and loan, has
been told it won the bidding for the thrift, the Light reported.
   Other bidders included NCNB Texas National Bank and Bank One
Texas, the Times Herald reported.
   ``The deal propels (First Gibraltar) into a leadership role for
all three of Texas' major cities _ Houston, Dallas and San
Antonio,'' said Robert Rieke, banking analyst at Rauscher Pierce
Refsnes in Dallas.
   With $9.8 billion in assets, First Gibraltar is the largest
savings and loan in Texas. The thrift reported $7.1 million net
income in the first nine months of 1989.

<HEAD>Ex-Pratt &amp; Whitney Worker File Age-Discrimination Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen salaried Pratt &amp; Whitney workers
who were dismissed from jobs in Connecticut have filed an
age-discrimination lawsuit in federal court against the jet-engine
manufacturer.
   Two of the laid-off employees from Pratt's plant in North Haven,
also filed a separate suit alleging racial discrimination played a
role in their layoffs.
   Both lawsuits were filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Hartford. They seek to reinstate most of the employees, all over
age 40, with back pay, plus punitive damages.
   If the court were to find a willful discrimination and award
double back pay to the employees, Pratt could face potential
payments of $3 million to $5 million.
   The lawsuits filed Tuesday are similar to ones filed last year
by Pratt workers laid off at the company's engine plant in Florida.
Those lawsuits, by 56 white-collar workers, are pending in federal
court in West Palm Beach.
   Pratt's layoffs followed what is called an ``activity value
analysis,'' or AVA, in which it examined all administrative
functions to eliminate those that overlapped.
   Curt Linke, Pratt vice president of communications, declined to
discuss the specifics of the lawsuits, which he had not read. But
he defended the layoffs.
   ``Overall, we conducted the AVA process as fairly and thoroughly
as possible,'' Linke said. ``And we believe we conducted the whole
process without discrimination.''
   Pratt, the East Hartford-based division of United Technologies
Corp., has eliminated 2,650 salaried jobs in the past two years.
Layoffs accounted for two thirds of the cuts; the remainder came
through resignations and retirements.
   Igor I. Sikorsky Jr., a Rocky Hill attorney representing the
former employees, said Pratt's layoffs abandoned a longstanding
policy that used seniority as a key factor in determining who gets
laid off.
   He had said last March that layoff discrimination lawsuits were
imminent, but the suits were delayed as Sikorsky first sought, and
last fall entered into, out-of-court negotiations with Pratt's
lawyers.
   The talks, aimed at reinstating employees wishing to return,
collapsed last month, Sikorsky said.

   The Dutch recording company Polygram NV said
Wednesday its earnings rose 27 percent in 1989 as its sales
increased 20 percent.
   Polygram, based in the Netherlands, said it earned 333 Dutch
guilders, or $173.5 million, last year, up from 262 million
guilders in 1988.
   On a per-share basis, the company's earnings translated to 2.08
guilders, up from 1.64 guilders a year earlier.
   Sales totaled 4.11 billion guilders, up from 3.43 billion
guilders in 1988.
   Polygram acquired A&amp;M Records and Island Records last year. The
company said it expected to have 18 percent of the world market for
recorded music once it completed its absorption of the two
companies.
   Polygram maunfactures Deutsche Grammophon, Philips Classics and
Decca-London classical recordings. Besides A&amp;M and Island, its pop
labels include Fontana, London, Mercury, Polydor, Vertigo, Verve
and Wing.
   The company is also involved in music publishing; film,
television and music video production; and direct marketing of
recordings.

   The orders come on the heels of a record-breaking $12 billion
year for Pratt in 1989 and represent ``the largest single order for
the PW4000 on record,'' said Pratt spokesman David Long.
   Long said the engines would be used to power both Boeing
747-400s and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 widebody aircraft.
   Pratt received firm orders for 99 engines, including spares,
worth about $900 million. If the airline follows through with its
options, Pratt would supply an additional 135 engines, including
spares, worth nearly $1.3 billion.
   Deliveries will begin in 1994 and carry through the end of the
decade, Long said.
   To put the magnitude of the order in perspective, all airline
orders for Pratt's popular PW4000 engine in 1989 combined totalled
700 engines worth about $4.7 billion, Long said.
   Selwyn Berson, president of Pratt's Commercial Engine Business,
said he was pleased that Singapore, which has an exclusively
Pratt-powered fleet of aircraft, intends to continue its
relationship with the jet-engine maker.
   In a prepared statement on the orders, Singapore Airlines said
the decision to remain with Pratt engines came after ``four months
of exhaustive evaluation.''
   The company said it also had considered engines produced by
Pratt's major rivals _ General Electric's CF6-80C2 and
Rolls-Royce's Trent 650 _ but concluded that while all three
companies offered high-quality, high-technology products, Pratt's
engines were preferable.
   ``Taking into account all factors, including financial and
technical, SIA decided that Pratt &amp; Whitney ... engines had the
edge over the other engines,'' the airline's statement said.
   Airline officials also said the new aircraft will permit the
company to compete better and ``take advantage of growth
opportunities provided by the changing global environment.''
   In addition to providing modern power, the airline said, the new
Pratt-powered fleet will be more fuel efficient and help reduce
pollution as well as costs.

<TEXT>
   Thursday's opening of the Geneva Motor Show, one
of the world's biggest, comes against a backdrop of increasing U.S.
and Japanese efforts to set up plants inside the integrating
European Community.
   Worldwide auto sales grew again in 1989, reaching record levels
for the fifth straight year, but industry watchers expect
competition in major markets to increase further and growth to slow
slightly this year.
   Many of the new models to be featured at the Geneva show's 60th
annual edition reflect how the industry is relying on powerful,
sporty cars with designer bodies to meet that competition.
   Ninety-nine automakers are displaying latest models at the
10-day show, which is aimed mostly at the tastes of non-American
car buyers. Switzerland is considered a highly competitive market
because it is highly motorized but has no domestic auto industry.
   Hyundai, which launched into the U.S. market in the 1980s, is a
new entry at Geneva this year. The South Korean maker is showing
its economy Pony model and the top-of-the-line Sonata sedan, which
listed at up to $19,660 in Switzerland.
   With manufacturers increasingly fighting for the medium to
high-priced sports car bracket, each of Japan's big three makers is
offering a new model.
   Nissan's 300 ZX, listed at $50,000, features a 280-horsepower V6
engine and four-wheel steering. New sporty offerings from Mazda and
Toyota sell for about $20,000.
   Italian makers Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia, plus France's
Peugeot, are showing substantially revamped sedans.
   World passenger car production rose 3.8 percent last year to
35.5 million units, with Japan gaining market share mainly at the
expense of U.S. automakers, industry figures show.
   But non-European manufacturers, particularly the Japanese, are
increasingly signaling fears about losing out in the giant European
market the EEC is due to complete by the end of 1992.
   Officials of Honda and Nissan called on the EEC Wednesday to
abolish restrictions on Japanese car imports as soon as possible
after 1992.
   In interviews in Geneva, Osamu Iida of Honda Motor Europe Ltd.
and Yoshikazu Kawana of Nissan Europe NV, rejected a charge made
this week by the French minister for European affairs, Edith
Cresson, that Japanese automakers want to destroy their U.S. and
European competitors.
   Kawana said Europe's consumers and its auto industry will suffer
if France succeeds in efforts to extend EEC curbs on Japanese
imports for 10 or 12 years after 1992.

specializing in local news coverage, serving demographically strong
Fairfield County,'' said William J. Rowe, publisher and chief
executive officer of The Advocate and Greenwich Time.
   ``I am confident that Times Mirror's Fairfield County dailies
will ably guide the further growth of our little oaks, and I'm

   The French group Expansion, which publishes 25
economic periodicals in Western Europe, announced that it was
breaking into the East European market through a joint venture with
a Polish publisher.
   Expansion's Eurexpansion unit is linking up with Zarzadzanie I
Bankow, publisher of the financial weekly Gazeta Bankowa, to
jointly produce Gazeta.
   The Polish magazine will make use of Expansion's editorial and
marketing expertise and tap into the French group's information
network, according to a statement for release Thursday by the
Paris-based company.
   The publication hopes to double the 16 pages it prints each week
and will continue to carry foreign exchange and commodity prices,
analyses of government policies, and profiles of emerging Polish
companies.
   The agreement marks the first time the publishing industry has
taken advantage of a new Polish law allowing foreign companies to
hold a majority in joint ventures.
   Under the terms of the accord, Eurexpansion will hold 51 percent
of the venture, while Zarzadzanie will have 49 percent.
   Zarzadzanie President Josef Sniecinski said that with help from
Eurexpansion he hopes to double Gazeta Bankowa's current estimated
circulation of 22,000.
   Sneicinski, jailed for four years for his political beliefs,
founded Gazeta in 1988, the Eurexpansion statement said. The Gazeta
name is taken from a similar business tabloid founded in 1926,
which didn't survive under Communist rule.
   Expansion created Eurexpansion last year, and its shareholders
include Belgium's Mediafina, Class Editori of Italy and Dow Jones &amp;
Co. of the United States.
   The Eurexpansion accord follows news Tuesday that French
publishing giant Robert Hersant, a unit of Socpresse, will launch
two business periodicals in a joint venture with two Soviet
companies.
   Hersant's new publication, entitled ``Businessman,'' will be
published in Russian, while the other, ``Business in the USSR,''
will be in English.
   Hersant is seeking circulation of 100,000 for the former and
40,000 for the latter, according to French press reports.
   Sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
Eurexpansion also is looking into possible ventures in the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Al-Fayed Brothers Lied in Harrods Takeover, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Al-Fayed brothers, who waged a bitter $1
billion battle for Harrods in 1985, exaggerated their wealth and
background to win the famous department store, a government report
said Wednesday.
   Mohamed, Ali and Salah Al-Fayed were thought to have come from a
wealthy and established Egyptian trading family that exported
cotton to Lancashire in the 19th century and built up a shipping
empire, when really they were the sons of a teacher from a poor
quarter of Alexandria, Egypt, the report said.
   The Al-Fayeds denied Wednesday that they misled anyone in
connection with the battle for Harrods owner House of Fraser PLC.
   Lonrho PLC, which lost the fight for Harrods and has continued
to battle the Al-Fayeds for the past five years, launched a fresh
multi-pronged assault Wednesday.
   Lonrho Chairman Edward du Cann said the government, Parliament
and the British financial community must act quickly on the report
or the credibility of all three would be undermined.
   The government released its previously withheld report after the
Serious Fraud Office and the Director of the Public Prosecutions
said last week they would not pursue a criminal prosecution
stemming from the takeover.
   The government has repeatedly declined to refer the bid to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and did so again on Wednesday.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in the House of Commons he
had referred the trade department's report to authorities to
determine whether there should be any prosecution for giving false
evidence to investigators.
   However, he said he would not seek to have any House of Fraser
directors disqualified.
   Documents produced by the Al-Fayeds as evidence for the trade
department's investigation, including their birth certificates,
were false and they knew they were false, the government report
said.
   The report said it was likely the brothers used their
association with the Sultan of Brunei raise funds toward the 1985
purchase of the department store chain.
   The Al-Fayeds did not have enough money of their own to buy
House of Fraser, trade department inspectors Hugh Aldous and Sir
Henry Brooke said.
   The Al-Fayeds said in a statement they bought House of Fraser
chain with cash of their own. The trade department's investigation
was unfair and the accusations ``worthless,'' they said.
   Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, has waged a
long, expensive and very public campaign to have the takeover
reversed, repeatedly alleging that the Al-Fayeds misrepresented
themselves to win Harrods. The Al-Fayeds repeatedly have denied
those allegations.
   Over the years, Rowland has developed a reputation for
obsessively pursuing a bitter, unsuccessful vendetta.
   Lonrho is pursuing its own claims in civil court, du Cann said
Wednesday.
   Mohamed Al-Fayed, who serves as House of Fraser chairman and is
visibly proud of owning the crown jewel of British retailing, has
vowed that ``only God'' would take Harrods away from him.
   Founded in 1849 by tea merchant Henry Charles Harrod, Harrods
boasts that it provides everything from baby clothes to funerals,
from furnished palaces to fresh pheasants.
   Its five-story red-brick building in fashionable Knightsbridge
is a major tourist attraction and a shopping haunt of Britain's
royal family.

   The stock market edged ahead today, getting a
bit more mileage out of its late-winter rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 112 points from Feb.
24 through Tuesday's close, rose another 1.80 to 2,678.60 by 3 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 767 up, 702
down and 486 unchanged.
   Analysts said hopes persisted that the economy could keep
growing at a sluggish pace, avoiding the recession that many feared
might have taken hold by now.
   There are some expectations that that view will be bolstered on
Friday with the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which will provide one of the first gauges of economic
activity in February.
   The data are expected to show an increase of 200,000 to 250,000
in nonfarm payroll employment, compared with a 275,000 gain in
January.
   Stocks also got a boost Tuesday from a downturn in open-market
interest rates. In today's trading in the market for U.S. Treasury
securities, rates showed only slight and mixed changes.
   MGM-UA Communications jumped 3| to 17| on word of a $20-a-share
takeover offer from Pathe Communications.
   Compaq Computer rose 2&rsqb; to 91 and Businessland was up 2 at 10}.
Compaq gave Businessland the right to sell its products in the
United States, renewing a business connection severed more than a
year ago.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .07 to 186.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .46 at 359.27.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 136.11 million shares with an
hour to go.

   The House today upheld President Bush's veto
of a bill to let the government intervene in the year-old Eastern
Airlines dispute.
   The 261-160 vote was 7 votes short of the two-thirds needed to
overturn the veto.
   Bush vetoed in December a measure creating a special panel to
investigate and recommend solutions to the bitter dispute between
Eastern and 8,500 mechanics and other ground service workers. He
said Congress had no business intervening in a labor-management
dispute.
   Override supporters said it was the last chance to save the
bankrupt carrier and jobs for the machinists who walked out last
March.
   But members who sided with Bush said a congressional panel would
not be able to solve the dispute and the matter belonged in
bankruptcy court.
   During debate on the override attempt, Rep. Bud Schuster, R-Pa.,
accused Democrats of having an ``uncontrollable urge to bash the
president'' on the issue.
   But Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash., said ``our government is
turning its back on the working men and women of this country. The
president said there is no emergency, but he doesn't have to fly on
an airline that's on the verge of collapse.''
   The vote dealt a huge blow to organized labor and gave Bush a
victory in his second veto confrontation of the election-year
session. Bush also won the first showdown in January, when the
Senate narrowly upheld his veto of a measure protecting Chinese
students.
   Union officials contend Bush has sided with Frank Lorenzo, head
of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, in the dispute and
therefore is supporting what they consider union-busting practices
by Lorenzo.
   ``Some Republicans are going to support the president on this,
but I think they're going to do it holding their nose and walking
the plank for a person they don't particularly feel good about,''
Oberstar said, referring to Lorenzo.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection in March 1989 shortly after
the International Association of Machinists walked out. The
machinists were later joined by pilots and flight attendants, who
ended their strike late last year. The machinists are still out.
   Eastern has hired replacements for some of the strikers and has
tried to reorganize itself as a smaller carrier.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart said the administration still
thinks the Eastern strike ``is something that we should not be
involved in.''
   In a letter to House members Tuesday, Machinists President
George Kourpias said an override would ``send a loud clear signal
that it is time to stop labor-bashing.''
   On Monday, bankruptcy examiner David Shapiro sent a leader to
House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois urging Congress
to stay out of the dispute, saying its intervention might
jeopardize the remaining 17,000 jobs at Eastern.

<HEAD>Automakers Review Sales Estimates</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DT1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Big Three automakers are reviewing
their estimates for 1990 sales amid signs that sales early this
year have been stronger than they had expected.
   ``I think that as the year begins to unfold, that the more
optimistic forecast of more like 14.5 million cars and trucks is
more likely,'' Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald said
in an interview Tuesday.
   Late last year, Chrysler was the most pessimistic of the Big
Three companies, forecasting car and truck sales industrywide of
14.2 million for 1990, down from 14.85 million in 1989.
   ``Backing up three months as the fourth quarter of last year
unfolded, there was a lot of concern that this year could really be
tough,'' Greenwald said.
   Since then, Chrysler and General Motors Corp. have delayed
factory shutdowns and layoffs, January and February sales were
running less than 1 percent behind last year's rate and the spring
buying season is getting under way.
   On Monday, when February sales figures were reported, Robert
Rewey, Ford Motor Co.'s North American sales vice president,
indicated that the No. 2 automaker may revise its estimate.
   ``Looking at the first two months of the new year, sales are not
only much improved from the fourth quarter, but somewhat ahead of
the pace we anticipated when establishing our industry forecast of
14.5 million units in 1990,'' he said.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith predicted as recently as last week that
sales for the year will come in between 14.5 million and 15 million
with a bias toward the upper end of the range.
   However, auto analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton
of New York City, who is holding to his sales prediction of about
14.3 million cars and trucks, said even though the sales rate may
be higher than originally projected, the increase is coming at a
price.
   ``When you have a thousand dollars a unit (in incentives) in the
marketplace for all the manufacturers on average, you should be
able to sell anything, even ice to Eskimos,'' Phillippi said.
``We're pumping units out the door, but it's essentially profitless
prosperity.''
   Each of the Big Three companies reported sharply lower profits
for the fourth-quarter and all of 1989, partly because of incentive
costs, and there are predictions that the earnings downturn will
continue.
   Yet there are indications that automakers aren't as worried
about the next few months as they were during the last months of
last year.
   GM has put off for a few months the closing of its Lakewood car
assembly plant in Atlanta. Late last year, that shutdown, which
will result in about 2,200 workers being laid off, was scheduled
for mid-March. Now, GM says, it won't happen until April or May.
   Chrysler also indefinitely suspended some planned reductions in
assembly line speeds, which also would have resulted in indefinite
layoffs. Ford plans no changes in production that will result in
layoffs.
   The reductions are aimed at bringing production levels more into
line with sales levels. But, as Rewey said, sales for the first two
months of the year seem to be running a bit above anticipated
levels.
   In January and February this year, automakers sold 2.19 million
cars and trucks, down just 0.8 percent from last year, when
companies were offering attractive incentives.
   Typically, March and April are strong car and truck sales months
as Americans get ready for spring and summertime road trips. Last
year, the sales pace during those two months lagged mainly because
of the attraction of incentives offered earlier in the year.
   This year, things could be different.
   Automakers and dealers are ready to let their inventories of
unsold cars creep up in anticipation of an increased buying pace.
   Chrysler recently extended an incentive program through March
for all of its vehicles except minivans, and Ford and GM cash-back
and low-interest financing offers run into April or May.
   ``What would we do if we didn't have that?'' Phillippi wondered
about incentive-enhanced sales. ``It's pretty clear that we are
going to have that all the way through the 1990 model year.
   ``I can't see incentives coming down appreciably unless there's
a heck of a lot more strength in the economy.''

   The Conference Board said Wednesday its
help-wanted advertising index, which measures the local, regional
and national supply of jobs, fell 3 points in January.
   The business research group said the seasonally adjusted index
fell to 146 in January from 149 in December. In January 1989, the
index was at 155.
   Advertising volume in major newspapers rose in four regions of
the country, declined in four and remained unchanged in one,
according to the monthly survey. The East South Central and
Mountain regions posted the steepest declines, 10 percent and 9.9
percent respectively, while the West South Central area had the
sharpest increase, 7.7 percent.
   ``The nation's unemployment rate has been holding steady at 5.3
percent for five months,'' said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist. ``There is widespread anticipation of sustained moderate
growth, which could easily lead to some pickup in labor demand.
   ``Presently, there is little concern about a recession. However,
labor demand is not softening, which may spell problems later this
year,'' he said.
   The monthly survey examines help-wanted advertising in 51 major
newspapers across the country.
   In the East South Central region, the newspapers are located in
Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.; and
Louisville, Ky.; the Mountain region includes papers in Denver,
Colo.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Salt Lake City, Utah. In the West South
Central area, the survey included Dallas, Houston and San Antonio,
Texas; New Orleans, La.; and Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla.

   Energy futures continued to slide Wednesday,
with refined oil products posting steep losses.
   Analysts said fundamental supply and demand factors plus
technical market forces encouraged selling on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
key grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 37 cents to close at $20.93 per
42-gallon barrel after shedding 28 cents on Tuesday. Later
contracts finished lower by slightly smaller amounts.
   The April contract of unleaded regular gasoline tumbled 1.06
cents to 56.73 cents a gallon, bringing its decline over the past
two sessions to 2.57 cents. On Monday the contract spurted 2.83
cents. Contracts for delivery further in the future also declined,
with the May contract off 1.08 cents.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc, No. 2
home heating oil for April delivery dropped 1.03 cents to 56.19
cents a gallon on top of Tuesday's loss of 0.77 cent. The April
contract soared 2.12 cents on Monday. Later contracts also finished
lower.
   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc., said traders sold in
response to weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute
showing crude oil stocks expanded slightly more than expected. The
increase in gasoline stocks was more in line with market
expectations.
   The API report was released Tuesday after the market closed.
   ``Everybody thinks there are adequate stocks right now,'' Steel
said.
   West Texas Intermediate also has been considered overpriced
relative to comparable grades of crude traded on foreign markets.
   Recent selling has pushed the April WTI contract below $21 a
barrel, breaking through what had been a technical support level.
   Heating oil prices have begun their normal seasonal weakness due
to lower demand during warm weather months, Steel said.
   ``From a trading point of view the winter's over,'' he said.

<HEAD>Georgia Pacific Announces Completion of Tender for Great Northern</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said Wednesday it has
completed its tender offer for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. stock
and plans to begin buying the 53.8 million outstanding shares of
the Connecticut paper products maker this week.
   The $65.75-a-share tender offer expired at midnight Tuesday, and
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said 97.3 percent of Great Northern's
outstanding shares had been tendered by the deadline.
   ``We expect to start purchasing the 58 million shares
tomorrow,'' Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Sheila Weidman-Farley said.
   After a bitter 3{-month holdout, Great Northern's management
agreed last month to a sweetened buyout bid from Georgia-Pacific.
The $5 billion merger is expected to produce the nation's largest
forest products company.
   Georgia-Pacific had $10 billion in sales last year, while Great
Northern, headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., had 1989 sales of $4
billion.
   Ms. Weidman-Farley said the company was satisfied with the 97.3
percent tender and had not expected to get 100 percent.
Stockholders who did not tender their shares will be issued stock
certificates worth $65.75 each which can be cashed in at any time,
she said.
   Shares which were not tendered include those held in trusts, by
people who are out of the country or by opponents of the takeover.
   ``It's impossible to get 100 percent,'' Ms. Weidman-Farley said.
``So everyone was pleased with this number.''
   She said Georgia-Pacific is compiling financial disclosure
material required by the Securities and Exchange Commission before
the buyout can be completed. The SEC filing, to be made within 30
days, will be followed by a shareholders meeting required by the
takeover laws in Maine, where Great Northern is chartered.
   No date has been set for the shareholders meeting, she said.
   Initially, Great Northern will operate as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific, Ms. Weidman-Farley said. Company
officials have declined to say specifically what their plans are
for Great Northern's mills.

<HEAD>Jury Rules For American Tobacco In Smoking Liability Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury decided Wednesday that American
Tobacco Co. should not be held liable for the death of a lung
cancer patient, rejecting claims that the company failed to warn
the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking.
   The six-member jury deliberated about two hours before returning
its verdict, culminating a three week trial. Lawyers representing
the plaintiff, the cancer victim's widow, said they would consider
an appeal.
   ``This just puts a further chill on anyone having the audacity
to take on one of the empires of industry,'' said Eric Nissen, one
of the plaintiff's attorneys.
   Andrew Lane, an attorney for American Tobacco, declined to
comment on the verdict. Earlier in the day during his closing
arguments, Lane stressed that the lung cancer victim, George
Kotler, had ample opportunity to quit smoking but chose to continue
his habit.
   The suit against American Tobacco, a subsidiary of American
Brands Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., marked one of the rare smoker
death cases to reach the courtroom.
   The first case to have a damages judgment came in 1988, when a
federal jury in New Jersey awarded $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone,
whose wife died of lung cancer. But an appeals court this year
overturned the jury award and ordered a new trial.
   The Boston suit was filed by Joanne Kotler, whose husband began
smoking when he was 11 and died in 1986 at age 55.
   The case focused on his smoking habits and American Tobacco's
actions prior to 1966, when Congress required warning labels on
cigarette packs.
   Lane told the jury that the first credible evidence linking lung
cancer to smoking surfaced in the 1950s, but the studies were not
definitive and some medical experts disagreed with the findings.
   Lane also argued that warnings would not have made a difference
for Kotler.
   He said that during the 1950s, the debate over cigarette smoking
became more widely reported, culminating with a highly publicized
report from the U.S. surgeon general in 1964 warning of the health
risks.
   But Lane said Kotler, who regularly read newspapers and likely
was aware of the controversy, did not heed the warnings. The first
time Kotler quit smoking was in 1975, when advised to do so by his
doctor, and he resumed several months later when his health
improved.
   ``Forty million people have stopped smoking,'' Lane said. They
made the decision. That's what this case is really about _ choice.''
   But Garry Inge, another attorney who helped present the case
against the cigarette company, argued that American Tobacco had a
duty to alert the public of the risks so Kotler could make an
informed choice. Studies in the 1940s warned about the dangers of
smoking, but American Tobacco's response was to encourage people to
buy its products, he said.
   ``Burying your head in the sand is not a defense,'' he said.
``When you're talking about people dying, you cannot wait for
scientific proof.''
   Inge also said the addictive nature of nicotine contributed to
Kotler's smoking habit.
   But Lane said when Kotler first tried to quit smoking, he showed
no symptoms of withdrawal. ``This was not a man compelled by the
outside,'' he said.

   Stock prices posted some spotty losses Wednesday
after the market ran into an afternoon flurry of selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 8 points
at midmorning, closed with a 7.21 loss at 2,669.59.
   Declining issues held a slight edge on advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 740 up, 762
down and 482 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.58 million
shares, up from 143.64 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 194.78 million shares.
   Analysts said hopes persisted that the economy could keep
growing at a sluggish pace, avoiding the recession that many feared
might have taken hold by now.
   There are some expectations that that view will be bolstered on
Friday with the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which will provide one of the first gauges of economic
activity in February.
   The data are expected to show an increase of perhaps 250,000 in
nonfarm payroll employment, compared with a 275,000 gain in January.
   Stocks got a boost Tuesday from a downturn in open-market
interest rates. By contrast, in Wednesday's trading in the market
for U.S. Treasury securities, rates showed a modest increase.
   MGM-UA Communications jumped 3} to 17} on word of a $20-a-share
takeover offer from Pathe Communications. Pathe shares gained { to

   Compaq Computer rose 3| to 92\ and Businessland was up 2 at 10}.
Compaq gave Businessland the right to sell its products in the
United States, renewing a business connection severed more than a

   Japan's NEC Corp. and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. said Wednesday they would cooperate in developing and
making a wide range of semiconductors and other computer
technologies.
   The agreement should enhance the U.S. company's access to
Japan's world-dominating electronics market.
   NEC, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, agreed to
cooperate with AT&amp;T's Microelectronics division on various projects
for at least five years.
   Under the agreement, AT&amp;T Microelectronics will receive a
license to market, design and produce NEC's advanced gate-array
computer chips, which are used widely in computers and other
electronics devices.
   AT&amp;T did not have the technology to produce these chips on its
own, spokeswoman Barbara Baklarz said from AT&amp;T Microelectronics
headquarters in Berkeley Heights, N.J.
   ``An important feature of this agreement is that customers of
both companies will enjoy the advantage of having two stable
sources of identical gate-array products,'' William Warwick,
president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, told reporters in Tokyo.
   In return, NEC will receive AT&amp;T's most sophisticated
computer-aided tools used to design computer chips, Warwick said.
   He said the two companies also are working on accelerating the
placement of AT&amp;T semiconductor products into a variety of NEC
products, such as communications systems and computers.
   In addition, AT&amp;T Microelectronics will help manufacture certain
NEC chips widely used in consumer electronics products.
   ``This will allow Japanese customers to obtain products made by
an American firm, and will give AT&amp;T a greater presence in the
Japanese market, especially with consumer electronics companies,''
Warwick said.
   ``This agreement shows that one single company cannot stand
alone and needs more resources to survive,'' said Tomohir
Matsumura, an NEC executive vice president and director of its
semiconductor division.
   ``It makes sense for AT&amp;T as a big semiconductor user to go to
NEC, a big semiconductor producer,'' said Charles Elliott, an
electronics analyst with the investment firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
``But AT&amp;T is also a big semiconductor developer, and it makes
sense for AT&amp;T to design and NEC to produce.''
   Millard Phelps, an analyst with the San Francisco brokerage
Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., said the agreement is part of a global
cooperation trend among electronics companies.
   AT&amp;T Microelectronics announced two weeks ago that it will
produce semiconductor memory chips for the international market in
a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corp., another major
Japanese chip manufacturer.
   International Business Machines Corp. said in January that it
would set up a joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany to
develop advanced memory chips.
   Neither AT&amp;T nor NEC would attach monetary figures to the
accord, but Warwick said he was confident it would be continued
after five years.
   Gate-array chips are the logic chips that customize computers
according to their use. They are a key component of a computer,
along with its microprocessor, or ``brain,'' and its memory.
   AT&amp;T lacked the technology to produce complementary metal oxide
semiconductor, or CMOS, gate-array chips, Ms. Baklarz said. These
are considered the most advanced gate-array chips.
   The agreement also will aid NEC's policy of increasing purchases
of foreign semiconductors to ease trade friction.
   U.S. officials, angered by what they claim is a closed Japanese
market to foreign semiconductors, say Japan agreed to boost the
foreign share of the semiconductor market here to 20 percent by
July 1991.
   But foreign chips' share stood at only 12.9 percent in the final
quarter of 1989, according to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   NEC expects to purchase $5.3 million worth of AT&amp;T
semiconductors in 1990, and more in 1991, though there is no target
figure for next year, NEC spokeswoman Akiko Sato said.
   The manufacturer plans to raise its internal use of foreign
computer chips from the current 20 percent to 23 percent by July
1991, when the U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord expires, and to
about 24 percent by the end of next year, Miss Sato said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Climb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for frozen concentrate orange juice climbed
higher Wednesday at New York's Cotton Exchange on speculation that
the U.S. Agriculture Department would revise downward its estimate
of Florida's orange crop.
   On other futures markets, pork bellies rose the faily limit,
energy and gold prices tumbled and grains were mixed.
   The USDA had earlier estimated 68 million boxes of oranges would
be harvested, but apparently came up 3 million short, said analyst
Judith Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. A revised report is due
out Friday.
   Futures prices have gone up about 80 cents since December's
freeze, peaking at over $2 a pound in mid-Janaury.
   On Wednesday, frozen orange juice settled .40 cent to 2.15 cents
higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $1.91 a pound.
   Prices for frozen pork bellies soared while other livestock
prices drifted mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   March, May, July and August contracts for bellies closed up the
daily limit of 2 cents.
   Light hog slaughter and firm cash prices supported prices in the
pork complex, said Dale Benson, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``The market also saw the U.S. giving the Soviet Union preferred
nation status and Canada sending beef carcasses to the Soviets.
Traders see any exports going elsewhere as exports are not coming
here. That's good,'' said Benson.
   Cattle settled .03 cent lower to .50 cent higher, with the
contract for April at 76.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05
cent lower to .12 cent higher, with March at 81.47 cents a pound;
hogs were unchanged to 1.10 cents higher, with April at 51.42 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.55 cents to 2.00 cents
higher, with March at 50.27 cents a pound.
   Energy futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil prices were pressured by an American Petroleum
Institute report Tuesday that showed larger inventories than
anticipated.
   Heating oil had opened higher on news of a decline in the API
distillate stock and a New Jersey barge explosion that dumped
100,000 gallons into the water.
   Crude oil settled 4 cents to 37 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at $20.93 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent
to 1.03 cents lower, with April at 56.19 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .55 cent to 1.08 cents lower, with April at
56.73 cents a gallon.
   Futures prices for corn were down, while soybeans and wheat were
mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``The corn market backed off, with a forecast for rain moving
into the corn belt,'' said Rich Feltes, an analyst with Refco Inc.
   Soybeans changed directions several times during the session,
due to a lack of export news or other developments concerning that
commodity, although there was no increase in selling by farmers
overnight, traders said.
   Professional buying supported wheat futures prices.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1\ cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents
lower, with March at $2.43 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\
cents lower, with March at $1.44{ a bushel; and soybeans were 2
cents higher to 1\ cents lower, with March at $5.76} a bushel.
   Gold fell sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York, due to
a stronger U.S. dollar. Silver was boosted by some overnight buying
in Zurich by Middle East interests, traders said.
   Gold settled $3.40 to $4.30 lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $400.20 a troy ounce; and silver was .3 cent
to .6 cent higher, with March at $5.12 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Electronic Pricing Errors Found in State Probe of Store Chain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIE AICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Product pricing errors at a large discount
store chain that used electronic price scanners has prompted the
state to probe other stores for similar problems, Attorney General
Donand Hanaway said Wednesday.
   State investigators announced Wednesday that a November
investigation of ShopKo Stores Inc. outlets in Wisconsin found
scanned prices at the checkout counter sometimes failed to match
the advertised sale price on store shelves.
   Shopko, a Green Bay-based retailer with more than 90 outlets in
Wisconsin and the Midwest, cooperated with the probe and has agreed
to offer rebates of $1 to $5 to customers who discover future
overcharges, Hanaway said.
   Gene Bankers, vice president of ShopKo, said the company had
taken steps to prevent future overcharges.
   Hanaway said the investigation found 33 electronic pricing
errors out of 270 items checked at 12 ShopKo outlets. Twenty-one of
the errors involved overcharges, ranging from 2 cents to $9.99,
while undercharges ranged from 2 cents to $5, he said.
   Hanaway said most of the pricing errors resulted because the
electronic price scanners were immediately reprogrammed after a
sale but the sale signs not removed from shelves.
   The attorney general said the overcharges ``were human errors
and not an attempt to defraud customers,'' but the 12 percent error
rate still was unacceptable.
   ``It's my suspicion that it's not just ShopKo,'' Hanaway said.
``It's much bigger than that.
   ``I am broadening the investigation to other general
merchandising stores and food stores in the state to determine if
pricing errors are occurring elsewhere,'' he said.
   John Gary, spokesman for the National Retail Federation in New
York City, said he did not know of any nationwide problem with
electronic scanning of sale items.
   ``This is the first time I've ever heard of this kind of
thing,'' Gary said.
   Bankers said to avoid future problems ShopKo planned to put the
expiration date of sales on all in-store advertisement signs.
   Hanaway said he believed the ShopKo probe was ``the first in
Wisconsin and, we believe, the nation,'' he said. ``We know of no
one else who has undertaken such an extensive investigation.''
   Steve Nicks, director of the state Consumer Protection Agency,
said similar checks may have been conducted on the local level at
individual stores.

<HEAD>Farmer Mac Ready to Pump Up Ag Credit Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmer Mac is a new kid on the financial block
but is almost ready to start building muscle in the nation's
agricultural credit market, officials said Wednesday.
   The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. _ Farmer Mac _ was
created a little more than two years ago by the Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987 as a secondary market for agricultural real estate
loans.
   Start-up procedures, which included the initial sale of $20
million in voting common stock to banks and other lenders, and the
naming of a 15-member board of directors, are expected before
Farmer Mac is ready to become active in the financial market later
this year.
   John R. Dahl, chairman of the board, said after the
corporation's second annual stockholders' meeting that underwriting
standards and other guides must be developed meticulously to ensure
integrity.
   Dahl said Farmer Mac has a ``very strong foundation'' and that
all the deadlines specified by Congress have been met.
   The aim of Farmer Mac, he said, is to `` ... to increase the
availability of capital, to allow agricultural borrowers and rural
housing borrowers an opportunity of more places to go to look for
credit.''
   Hopefully, Dahl added, these borrowers also ``will have the
benefits of competition and competitive interest rates.''
   But Dahl and Henry D. Edelman, the corporation's president and
chief executive officer, said they could not estimate a firm
timetable or identify those in line for actual ``pooling''
operations.
   Banks and other lenders can convert long-term assets _ in this
case real estate mortgages _ by selling the loans on the secondary
market. At that point, those who buy the mortgages package or pool
the loans and then sell loan-backed securities to the general
public.
   Meanwhile, the original lenders are able to increase their cash
and use it to make more loans to agricultural borrowers.
   Farmer Mac will share the risk of the farm real estate loan
business by guaranteeing returns on the securities.
   Other federal agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. (Freddie Mac), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae), and Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)
serve a similar function for their clientele.
   Dahl, a rancher from Gackle, N.D., said in an interview after
the meeting that ``we've come a long way'' in getting Farmer Mac on
solid ground. But he said there is no way to estimate the
corporation's eventual impact on the nation's agricultural credit
market.
   ``There's no history involved here,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of enthusiasm for Farmer Mac, and I wish I could tell you that
we're going to do a billion dollars in business, or something. But
there's no way we can predict this.''
   But what can be predicted, Dahl added, is that ``we're going to
to everything we possibly can to come up with the kind of program
that Congress envisioned agriculture needed.''

   Former Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. president
Robert Shulman has settled securities fraud charges but
negotiations are still underway with the generic drug maker itself,
federal regulators said Wednesday.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Shulman
consented _ without admitting or denying wrongdoing _ to a court
order barring him from further alleged securities law violations.
   Despite a Bolar statement to the contrary earlier this week,
``the case against the company has not yet been settled,'' said
Merri Jo Gillette-Meadows, an attorney with the SEC's Philadelphia
regional office, which brought the case against Bolar.
   Ms. Gillette-Meadows confirmed that negotiations with the
company were underway but would say no more.
   Last month, the SEC charged the drug maker with making
misleading and inadequate statements to the investing public about
an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration to suspend
shipment of its products.
   Copaigue, N.Y.-based Bolar came under fire after allegations by
a congressional panel that it appeared to have falsified lab test
results on its generic high blood pressure medication.
   Bolar has said it will close most of its manufacturing
operations while the FDA conducts an audit.
   The SEC said Shulman, who resigned from the company's board last
month, settled with the SEC on Friday.

   After two years on the auction block, MGM-UA
Communications said Wednesday it had accepted a $1.2 billion buyout
offer by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe
Communications Corp.
   Parretti also will take over $400 million in junk bond debt as
part of the deal, which may be the final scene of a long-running
drama in which a virtual cast of thousands considered buying all or
part of MGM-UA.
   The proposed marriage would join companies holding extremely
diverse film properties. Pathe's Cannon Releasing is a leading
purveyor of exploitation films, with upcoming releases like
``American Ninja 4'' and ``Lambada: The Movie,'' while MGM is is
one of Hollywood's jewels, responsible for everything from ``The
Wizard of Oz'' to ``Rain Man.''
   A $1.5 billion buyout of MGM was aborted last year when the
suitor, Australia's Qintex Group, missed a $50 million down payment.
   MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow said MGM already had
commitments from Pathe worth $100 million to distribute Pathe
movies. The deal also requires Parretti to come up with $200
million ``earnest money,'' with the first $50 million deposit due
Friday.
   ``If for whatever reason this doesn't close, then we have the
money for damages,'' said Barbakow.
   He said he was confident Parretti could arrange financing for
the deal, but declined to say where. Parretti was traveling
Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. In the past, he has
financed deals with help from Credit Lyonnais Group, the
international financial giant.
   The deal is the latest step in the globalization of Hollywood.
Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures last year, Australia's News
Corp. owns Fox, and the CBS, RCA and A&amp;M record labels are owned by
Japanese, German and Dutch companies. England's Television South
PLC owns television's MTM Productions.
   MGM-UA has profitable TV and home video divisions and a film
distribution system in place. It has been trying to start producing
films again recently after a two-year fallow period while its
controlling shareholder, Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
sought a buyer.
   MGM-UA Communications has lost money in four of the last five
years. The studio's only major release of 1990, ``Stanley &amp; Iris,''
with Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, was a critical and commercial
disaster.
   Pathe, which grew out of Parretti's purchase of Cannon Group in
1987, produces and distributes movies worldwide and controls more
than 1,000 theater screens in five countries. It has film
production facilities in Italy, a processing lab in France, and the
rights to 500 movies and 2,000 newsreels.
   ``MGM-UA's unique library and strong distribution capabilities
complement Pathe's existing business worldwide,'' Parretti, Pathe's
president and chief executive, said in a statement. ``We are
confident the transaction will result in a strong, dual company
structure which will be strongly competitive.''
   Pathe is making a tender offer of $20 per share for MGM-UA's
common stock, worth about $1 billion if all the shares are
tendered. Kerkorian will tender all his common shares, 82 percent
of the total, and also will sell his preferred stock to Pathe for
about $200 million. The transaction was expected to close by June
23.
   MGM-UA's stock jumped $3.75 to $17.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The companies said they would operate separately for the time
being, but the actual management structure remained unclear.
   Barbakow said he and other officials intended to stay on at MGM.
Many of them have worked with key Pathe officials in the past at
MGM-UA and other studios. For example, Pathe's film chief, Alan
Ladd Jr., once held that position at MGM-UA before he quit in 1988
over the company's lack of direction.
   ``As far as putting the management team together, that will have
to be resolved in the next three to four weeks,'' said Richard
Berger, MGM-UA's head of film production.
   Berger said MGM-UA already had committed $185 million to
restarting movie production, and said he assumed more would be
forthcoming from the new buyers.
   Analysts have estimated it would take $500 million for $600
million over two years for MGM-UA to re-establish itself as a major
movie producer.
   On Monday, the companies announced MGM-UA had reached a
five-year deal to distribute films from Pathe, a coup for MGM,
which is dependent on movies from independent producers until it
gets its own product back in the distribution pipeline.
   Parretti, whose $8.9 million Beverly Hills mansion is filled
with masterpiece paintings, owns a large European travel agency and
acquired the Cannon Group in summer 1987.
   He used Cannon as a platform to make unsuccessful bids on
several smaller entertainment companies, including De Laurentiis
Group, New World Entertainment and Kings Road Entertainment.
   Besides Qintex, other potential buyers for MGM at various times
included Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which was outbid by Qintex
last year, cable television magnate Ted Turner, Sony, producers Jon
Peters and Peter Guber, Warner Communications, financier Marvin
Davis, Weintraub Entertainment Group, PolyGram, The Walt Disney
Co., C. Itoh and Co., and a variety of other industry players.

<HEAD>Justice Raises No Objection to Latin American Routes Transfer</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has no objections to
Eastern Airlines' proposed sale of its prized Latin American routes
to rival American Airlines, the department said Wednesday.
   The proposed $471 million transaction still must be approved by
the Transportation Department and the federal bankruptcy court in
New York overseeing the reorganization of Miami-based Eastern.
   Joe Krovisky, a spokesman for the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said the division informed the two airlines and the
Transportation Department that its review of potential antitrust
problems of the sale had yielded no reason to object.
   Earlier this week, Pan Am Corp. filed objections to the route
sale with the Transportation Department, arguing that it would
eventually make American the dominant airline in Miami. Pan Am
asked for a hearing on the issue.
   Eastern and American have until March 13 to file responses to
Pan Am's objections. Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris
said a decision on the sale probably would be made in three or four
weeks.
   Under the agreement, American, the nation's largest airline,
would take over Eastern's routes from Miami to Ecuador, Peru,
Colombia, Bolivia, Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Paraguay.
   Pan Am told the Transportation Department that it, rather than
American, should be awarded service from Miami to Guayaquil and
Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia.
   Also included in the sale would be Eastern's Miami-Toronto
route, which Pan Am said it should be awarded.
   A sale of the routes would reduce Eastern to about two-thirds
its pre-strike size.

   Texas billionaire Harold Simmons said
Wednesday he would seek to change Lockheed Corp.'s by-laws to ban
management ``golden parachutes'' if his slate wins election to the
company's board of directors.
   Simmons disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that Lockheed has rejected his bid to put the issue of
large severance payments to management before shareholders at the
annual meeting March 29.
   Such agreements are known as golden parachutes, specifying the
payments due to executives of a company if they lose their jobs
after an ownership change.
   Simmons holds an 18.9 percent stake in the Calabasas,
Calif.-based defense contractor through a group of companies headed
by his NL Industries Inc., a Houston chemicals company.
   Simmons, of Dallas, said he will seek to change the company's
by-laws if his slate of candidates is elected to Lockheed's board.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System's Profit Down 33 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System reported Wednesday that
its fourth-quarter profit fell 33 percent from a year earlier.
   The system said it earned $181 million in the three months ended
Dec. 31, down from $270 million in the fourth quarter of 1989.
   The decline in net income was due largely to a reduction in
provisions for loan losses, reflecting an improvement in credit
quality, said Daniel Bienz, a vice president of the Federal Farm
Credit Banks Funding Corp., the financing arm of the farm credit
system.
   He said net interest income rose while most expenses remained
stable. Per-share figures do not apply.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers.
   The system took several steps last year to streamline its
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of
up to $4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.
   For all of 1989, the system earned $695 million, down from $704
million the previous year.
   ``For the second consecutive year, the system has achieved
favorable results suggesting continued progress in returning to
financial soundness and strength,'' said James A. Brickley,
president and chief executive officer of the Federal Farm Credit
Banks Funding Corp.
   Net interest income totaled $275 million for the fourth quarter,
up from $216 million in the year-earlier quarter, and $1.01 billion
for the full year, up from $787 million in 1988.
   The system said net interest income increased as a result of
continued improvement in the credit quality of its loan portfolio
stemming from a reduction in nonaccrual loans.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted
for only as they come in rather than when they are due.

<HEAD>Argentines Sentenced in Lycra Extortion Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Argentine convicted of trying to
extort $10 million from the Du Pont Co. in exchange for stolen
documents detailing the company's production of Lycra was sentenced
Wednesday to 6{ years in prison.
   Two co-defendants received prison terms in U.S. District Court
in a scheme involving sensitive documents taken from Du Pont's
Lycra manufacturing plant in Mercedes, Argentina.
   Lycra is Du Pont's trade name for spandex, an elastic fiber used
in clothing such as swimsuits and leotards. The Wilmington-based
chemicals manufacturer controls more than 50 percent of the world
spandex market, with more than $600 million in sales in 1988.
   Bruno Skerianz, 52, the alleged mastermind of the extortion
plot, also was placed on three years' probation by U.S. District
Judge Joseph Longobardi. Co-defendants Raul Armando Giordano, 37,
and Antonio Ruben Inigo, 40, received 3{-year prison sentences and
three years' probation.
   Attorneys for the defendants said they plan to appeal.
   The three were convicted in December of one count each of
conspiracy to extort and attempted extortion. Each count carried a
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and
a maximum five years' probation.
   Prosecutors said during the trial that Du Pont had to agree to
pay for the documents or Skerianz would have sold them to a
competitor.
   Du Pont also made an agreement with the three men that they
would not work in spandex production for five years and that Du
Pont would sell spandex yarn to a company chosen by Skerianz during
the period, the government said.
   Defense lawyers maintained that Skerianz had not attempted
extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture
spandex for Radicci, an Italian textile manufacturer.
   Skerianz had worked for Du Pont more than 20 years ago. The
others resigned in the fall of 1988 from the Mercedes plant.
   The three defendants and Lorenzo de Bianchini were arrested in
February 1989 in Geneva, Switzerland, after an aborted attempt to
return the documents for $10 million. Petrosino was arrested at the
beginning of last summer.
   Longobardi ordered the three defendants to pay $100 to a
victims' compensation fund. He said he did not impose a fine or
order restitution to Du Pont because of the defendants' bleak
financial situations.
   The men were sentenced to concurrent terms on each count. A
fourth defendant, Jose Petrosino, is fighting extradition from
Italy. Charges against Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini, who testified
for the prosecution, were dropped.
   Du Pont spokesman R. John Malloy said the company was pleased
with the sentences, which he said would be ``a strong deterrent for
those who might consider doing similar things.''

   The dollar was mixed in foreign exchange trading
Wednesday as it struggled against a concerted effort by central
banks to bring the U.S. currency lower.
   Gold prices fell, closing below $400 an ounce in London.
   Traders reported the Federal Reserve and other central banks
entered the currency markets to sell dollars, and a published
report in Tokyo said the members of the Group of Seven industrial
nations had agreed to intervene jointly to try to stop the dollar's
climb.
   But the attempt was only partially successful. The dollar rose
sharply in Europe and was mixed in New York, where it still managed
to advance against the Japanese yen, the currency which the G-7 is
trying the hardest to prop up.
   In New York, the dollar rose to 150.35 yen from late Tuesday's
149.85 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar advanced to 150.75 yen from 149.50
yen Tuesday. It was quoted in London at 151.15 yen.
   Richard Levine, vice president for foreign exchange at Elders
Futures Inc., said the dollar appeared to be rising on commercial
and investment demand, and not just on speculation.
   ``We haven't seen this kind of demand for dollars since the end
of 1989, and probably going back to the summer of 1989,'' Levine
said.
   Despite the efforts of the central banks, the increased demand
for the dollar was likely to lift it even higher, he said.
   Overseas traders said the continuing lack of confidence in the
Japanese yen and the West German mark, as well as a brighter view
of the U.S. economy, is also supporting the dollar.
   The dollar fell against the mark in New York after rising in
Frankfurt. In New York the dollar closed at 1.69815 marks, compared
to late Tuesday's 1.7035, and in Frankfurt it closed at 1.7075 West
German marks, up from 1.7005 marks.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In New York,
sterling slipped to $1.6465 from 1.6475 late Tuesday. In earlier
London trading, the pound fell to $1.6388 from $1.6495.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4995 Swiss francs, down from 1.5000;
5.7400 French francs, down from 5.7565; 1,252.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,257.00; and 1.18305 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18565.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.5075 Swiss francs, up from 1.4985; 5.7665
French francs, up from 5.7450; 1.9155 Dutch guilders, up from
1.9105; 1,259.00 Italian lire, up from 1,254.75; and 1.1853
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866.
   Gold dealers blamed the high dollar and a stronger Wall Street
for the precious metal's decline. Advances in the U.S. currencies
and the stock markets have made gold a less attractive investment.
   A troy ounce of gold fell $3.40 to $400.20 on the Commodity
Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank of New York later
quoted a bid of $400.60 a troy ounce, down $2.85 from late Tuesday.
   In London gold slipped below $400, closing at a late bid price
of $399.25 a troy ounce, down from $405. In Zurich, the metal fell
to $400.75, down from $405.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.83 to close at a bid $402.90
an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. The metal gained 0.6 cent to close at
$5.122 a troy ounce on the Comex in New York after falling in
London to a late bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce, down from $5.15.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound; Dollar Lower Against Yen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
sharply Thursday morning, while the U.S. dollar dropped against the
yen.
   The dollar ended morning trading at 150.13 yen. It started the
day at 150.25 yen, down 0.50 yen from Wednesday's close at 150.75
yen, and ranged between 149.85 yen and 150.35 yen.
   Reassured by the yen's recovery, the price of the benchmark
10-year No. 119 Japanese government bond inched up to 86.91 points,
up from the previous day's close of 86.67. The bond's yield was
7.15 percent, down from 7.20 percent late Wednesday.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 470.98 points, or 1.41
percent, ending morning trading at 33,833.32.
   The index, which had lost 428.74 points Wednesday, plunged
further in early morning trading as arbitragers sold issues to
collect profits out of the spread between the stock and futures
markets, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities
Co.
   Program trading sell orders pushed the Nikkei below the
33,000-point mark temporarily, but the index made a dramatic
recovery, recouping more than 860 points by the end of morning
trading.
   ``... the index kept coming back even with frequent arbitrage
sellings,'' Nomura said. ``The market seems to have hit its
bottom.''
   So far this year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index has at
its worst lost more than 5,500 points, or 14.3 percent.
   Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. and the department story Mitsukoshi
have joined other major companies that have canceled or postponed
new equity issues because of the market's weakness, Japanese news
reports said Thursday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the yen opened higher in Tokyo
following dollar-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan in the
Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo.
   The extent of the central bank intervention in the Sydney market
was not immediately known. The bank in recent weeks reportedly has
sold billions of dollars in both Japanese and overseas markets to
stem the yen's decline.
   Overnight intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York
also helped support the yen, dealers said.
   Discouraged by active intervention by central banks, market
players were reluctant to push the dollar higher, a dealer with a
major Japanese bank said.
