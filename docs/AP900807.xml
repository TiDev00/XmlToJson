   Iraqi troops rounded up 28 Americans in Kuwait
on Monday and some of them later were reported in Baghdad, the
State Department said Monday night.
   The Americans were among more than 300 British citizens and
other foreigners picked up by the Iraqis at three hotels in Kuwait.
   ``We have reports that a dozen or so (Americans) have arrived in
Baghdad,'' said a State Department official who spoke on condition
that his name not be used.
   ``The embassy is taking steps to verify these reports and get in
contact with them.''
   The official said he had no immediate word on the citizens of
other countries picked up in Kuwaiti hotels or on the rest of the
Americans, but ``this does not mean anything is wrong'' in view of
the time needed to locate and identify people in the Iraqi capital.
   It appeared that the new arrivals were being housed in the same
hotel where 11 American oilfield workers picked up by invading
Iraqi troops were taken, this official said.
   In London, a British spokesman said that government believed 366
people had been assembled, mostly passengers from a British Airways
flight stranded in Kuwait since the invasion by Iraqi troops began
Thursday.
   Before reports of the location of the U.S. citizens in Baghdad
were received in Washington, U.S. officials said they did not rule
out that the foreigners would show up in Baghdad unharmed.
Nonetheless, they issued a warning.
   ``We hold Iraq responsible for their safety,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``It's premature to call them hostages,'' she said. ``We don't
know their destination.''
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat to the State Department to
demand information about the whereabouts of the 28.
   The meeting with Kelly lasted less than 15 minutes, after which
the Iraqi ambassador tried to evade reporters by leaving through a
side entrance. When reporters caught up with him, he said, ``I have
no statement to make.''
   The safety of Americans was also brought up at a meeting in
Baghdad earlier in the day when President Saddam Hussein summoned
the senior U.S. diplomat there, Joseph Wilson.
   During the two-hour meeting, Wilson demanded that Iraq respect a
commitment given last week to protect Americans, said Tutwiler. The
meeting apparently occurred before U.S. officials learned of the 28
missing Americans.
   Tutwiler described the meeting as ``serious'' but declined to
divulge details. Another official said the session was ``not
terribly pleasant.''
   Secretary of State James Baker discussed the safety of U.S.
citizens in Kuwait and Iraq with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in a 30-minute telephone conversation Monday.
Shevardnadze, whose government has announced an arms boycott of
Iraq, said he was worried about Soviet citizens in Kuwait and Iraq,
said another official.
   It was the second time since the invasion that the State
Department has raised an alarm about missing Americans, reflecting
the vulnerability of the estimated 3,000 U.S. citizens in Kuwait
and 500 others in Iraq.
   On Thursday, 11 American oil workers were picked up by Iraqi
troops at three oilfields in Kuwait. They turned up in Baghdad on
Saturday and were free to leave the country once the airport
reopens.
   Airports and ports in Kuwait and Baghdad remained closed Monday,
but some Americans managed to leave Kuwait, said Tutwiler. Another
State Department official said the number of those who managed to
get out was small, but he declined to say how they left.
   Several Americans managed to drive to Saudi Arabia late last
week. U.S. consular officials were standing by on the Saudi side of
the border to assist anyone who comes out.
   The U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait have been in touch with
most of the Americans in those countries, said Tutwiler. The State
Department is also in touch with the families of Americans in the
United States through a special hotline.

   President Bush said Monday ``the world is
united'' to stop Iraq's aggression, while Pentagon sources said
U.S. warships had moved close enough to launch air strikes
throughout the Persian Gulf or even against Iraqi targets.
   A possible blockade against Iraq was mentioned by both British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney after they met separately with Bush.
   In a victory for Bush, the U.N. Security Council voted 13-0 for
sweeping trade and military sanctions, including a ban on oil
purchases, as punishment for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``These sanctions will be enforced _ whatever it takes,'' Bush
vowed.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the West would have to consider a naval
blockade of the Persian Gulf if United Nations sanctions against
Iraq proved ineffective.
   Mulroney agreed that a blockade might be necessary to make the
sanctions stick. ``If you look at the geography, it certainly
wouldn't hurt at all,'' he said.
   The White House said it was discussing ``military
possibilities'' with Persian Gulf states to prevent Iraq's Saddam
Hussein from taking his conquering army into oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Britain had ordered two additional frigates
to join its single warship in the gulf, making Britain the second
NATO ally to send extra forces. France earlier dispatched a frigate
to join two French warships.
   The United States also pressed a campaign to choke off Iraq's
oil exports by closing pipelines in Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
   Bush refused to say what Turkey and Saudi Arabia would do but
said, ``I think you'll see a lot of countries now coming together
to deny this man (Saddam) any market at all.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney went to the Saudi city of Jiddah
to discuss security arrangements and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was ordered to go to Turkey at midweek.
   There was rising concern for the safety of Americans.
Twenty-eight U.S. citizens were among foreigners rounded up by
Iraqi troops from three hotels in Kuwait and taken away by bus, the
State Department said. About a dozen were reported to be in
Baghdad, the department said.
   ``We hold Iraq responsible for their safety,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   With anger growing about gasoline price increases at home,
members of Congress set hearings for Tuesday on possible
price-gouging in reaction to the Mideast situation. The Justice
Department said it would be looking for anti-trust violations and
would vigorously prosecute any it found.
   The administration was heartened by the U.N. vote. ``The world
is united against the kind of aggression that we've witnessed,''
the president said.
   He said the U.N. measure ``gives an awful lot of muscle to
countries and we want to see them use it'' against Iraq.
   He noted that oil is a commodity that could be cut off under the
U.N. measure.
   Mrs. Thatcher, standing alongside Bush, said, ``I cannot
remember a time when we had the world so strongly together against
an action as now.''
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, also at the White House,
said, ``This is the moment for the West to show cohesion,
determination, to make it clear what cannot be accepted in this
world and to safeguard its own security interests.''
   Warning of dire consequences to America's economy from curtailed
oil supplies, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was
``clearly in the national interest to stop Saddam Hussein.''
   With Saddam's troops massed on the border of Saudi Arabia,
Fitzwater said, ``The defense of Saudi Arabia is paramount.''
   Bush, asked if Saddam had pledged not to invade Saudi Arabia,
said, ``I have had no such assurances directly to me.'' Iraqi
officials have said they will not invade Saudi Arabia.
   Bush consulted over lunch with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash. He also conferred with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney over dinner. Posing for pictures with Mulroney, Bush said,
``We have a lot to consult about, given the naked aggression of
Iraq.''
   Afterward, Mulroney told reporters, ``If those pipelines were
shut down and if there was a degree of appropriate interdiction,
they would have a great deal of difficulty in selling their
product.''
   ``And if the resolution of the United Nations Security Council
bit the way it must bite, then they're going to have a great deal
of difficulty in buying products that they need for their
citizenry.'' He said Turkey deserved NATO protection if necessary
if it cut Iraq's pipeline.
   The NATO treaty requires members to treat an attack against one
as an attack against all, and Turkey is a member of NATO.
   Defense Secretary Cheney, after an overnight flight, arrived in
the Saudi city of Jidda for talks on security arrangements. ``We
have discussed military possibilities and our abilities with all
the countries in the gulf,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``From the moment the first Iraqi soldier entered Kuwait, it has
been clearly in the national interest to stop Saddam Hussein,'' he
said. ``This is an overt situation. His tanks are real and moving.
Our response is real and moving on all the fronts: diplomatic,
economic, political and military.''
   Bush also ordered Baker to Turkey, which controls a vital
pipeline for Iraq's oil. Another pipeline for Iraqi oil crosses
Saudi Arabia.
   In a display of superpower cooperation, Baker talked by
telephone for 30 minutes with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze about moving quickly at the United Nations for
sanctions against Iraq, Tutwiler said.
   The State Department urged all Americans in Kuwait and Iraq to
leave as soon as possible and said it was withdrawing all
non-essential embassy personnel and their families from those
countrie.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat to demand information about the
whereabouts of the missing 28 Americans.
   ``It's premature to call them hostages,'' Tutwiler said. ``We
don't know their destination.''
   Meanwhile, Iraq's Saddam summoned the senior U.S. diplomat in
Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, for a meeting that lasted several hours,
Tutwiler said. She said Wilson raised the question of safety of the
3,000 Americans in Kuwait and the 500 in Iraq.
   The administration said there was no sign that Iraqi military
units were pulling out of Kuwait.
   ``To the contrary, the Iraqi military presence throughout
Kuwait, including along the Saudi border, remains extremely large
and threatening,'' Fitzwater said.
   Pentagon sources said two U.S. aircraft carriers, the USS
Independence near the Persian Gulf and the USS Eisenhower in the
Mediterranean Sea, had moved within range to launch warplanes down
the Persian Gulf and as far as Iraqi targets.
   Jawboning suppliers, Fitzwater said, ``It is not clear that all
of the increases that have been reported at the consumer level are
necessary.''
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
``threatens regional and world stability, threatens OPEC and could
force severe economic consequences in the United States.
   Bush talked by telephone Sunday night with Jordan's King
Hussein, who has stood out in defending Saddam against world
condemnation.

   The Miss America Pageant is
negotiating to bring back for this year's show Bert Parks, who
serenaded newly crowned beauty queens with ``There She Is'' for 25
years before being dumped as emcee in 1980.
   ``I can confirm we are talking to people on behalf of Mr.
Parks'' and to Parks himself, pageant director Leonard Horn said
Monday. ``Nothing has been finalized.''
   Gary Collins and Phyllis George would still be co-hosts of the
show, but Parks would sing ``There She Is'' during the winner's
traditional walk down the runway, said a source on the pageant
board of directors.
   Calls to Parks, 75, at his Greenwich, Conn., home were not
immediately returned.
   His firing a decade ago in favor of Ron Ely, who played
``Tarzan'' on television, stirred a public outcry. Johnny Carson
led a letter-writing campaign in support of Parks, and 20,000
people took part.
   Parks went on to play host at other pageants, some serious,
others silly.
   Former pageant director Albert Marks Jr., who died last year,
said in 1980 that he fired Parks because he wanted to appeal to a
younger generation unfamiliar with Parks or little enamored of his
rendition of the theme song.
   Parks has said the firing was the best thing to happen to his
career.
   He has since been host of the Mrs. America Pageant, the U.S. Man
of the Year, a small-dog contest and a prettiest tugboat contest.
In the new Marlon Brando movie ``The Freshman,'' he serenades a
Komodo dragon, a 6-foot lizard.
   This year's pageant is scheduled for Sept. 4-8 and will be shown
on NBC.
   State pageant directors applauded the effort to bring back Parks.
   ``I like Bert. I thought he did a great job,'' said Charlie
Welsh, director of the Miss Oklahoma Pageant. ``I'm sure he is
capable of doing a great job.''
   ``He and the Miss America Pageant were kind of synonymous,''
said Nate Zauber, director of the Miss New Jersey Pageant. ``This
would be the return of a legend. It would be a return to tradition
and very welcome.''
   The source on the Miss America board said the pageant would be
redressing a wrong.
   ``A lot of people were very unhappy the way he was fired,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said Parks
learned of his firing from the news media.
   Horn said Parks' possible return is part of an effort to do
something special for the pageant's 70th anniversary, for which at
least 26 former Miss Americas are returning.
   ``He was a major contributor to the popularity of the program,''
Horn said.

   Yvette Hernandez never votes _ not for mayor of
New York, not for Congress, not even for president. But if Puerto
Rico's future comes to a vote, she's ready to head for the nearest
polling place.
   ``Why shouldn't I vote? I'm Puerto Rican,'' she declares.
   That this furniture saleswoman has lived in New York for 17
years matters little. She was born in Puerto Rico, and if the
island is to decide its future _ independence, statehood, or no
change _ she wants a say.
   She is not alone. Even as Congress debates when and if to hold a
plebiscite, a parallel debate is going on in and out of the
mainland Puerto Rican community: Should Puerto Ricans who left the
island _ and even the descendants of those emigrants _ have a vote
in its destiny?
   ``We think of ourselves as one nation and Puerto Rico is never
out of mind for us. And that's a fact,'' explains U.S. Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-Bronx.
   Serrano, himself Puerto Rican born, has proposed an amendment to
the plebiscite legislation that would extend the vote to anyone
born in Puerto Rico or with at least one parent born on the island.
   The proposal is unprecedented, according to Columbia University
law professor Henry P. Monaghan.
   ``There is no case in which there have been people who are not
living in a territory who are enfranchised,'' he said.
   The idea of 2.5 million people on the mainland taking part in
the plebiscite doesn't sit well with everyone, especially Sergio
Pena Clos, a member of the island's Senate.
   ``They've left the island. They've abandoned the island and now
they want to vote?'' said Pena Clos. ``They'll be affecting my
destiny, the island's destiny and the destiny of my descendants.''
   Serrano's reply: ``This is not an election for public office.
This is an election on status _ political status _ and that
decision belongs to all the Puerto Rican people.''
   Serrano's words echo on the streets of East Harlem, home to many
of New York's 1 million Puerto Ricans.
   ``This is something that is a big decision. This is not like an
election that takes place every four years,'' said Carlos de Jesus,
the New York-born son of a woman from Puerto Rico. ``Because,
depending on the outcome of that vote, many people here might just
want to go back to Puerto Rico.''
   His wife, Carmen, also born in New York, wants to vote.
   ``No matter where in the world they are now, they should be
allowed to vote. It's our right and no one has the right to take
that away,'' she said.
   Puerto Rico, in fact, has not been independent since it was
conquered by Ponce de Leon for Spain in 1509. The island remained a
Spanish colony until the Spanish-American War of 1898, when became
a U.S. territory.
   Puerto Rico became a U.S. commonwealth in 1952, exposing its
people to a dizzying array of contradictory rights and
proscriptions.
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and are eligible for military
service, but cannot vote for president. They elect their own
governor and Legislature, but their representative to Congress has
no vote there. Federal law applies to the island, but Puerto Ricans
pay no federal taxes.
   In a 1967 non-binding referendum, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans
said they wanted to retain commonwealth status while 39 percent
wanted statehood. But recent polls indicate that a slim majority
favors statehood.
   It is not clear that they will have an opportunity to vote in
the near future. President Bush, who strongly backs statehood for
Puerto Rico, has urged Congress to pass plebiscite legislation
mandating that whatever is decided by the voters be implemented by
1993.
   In a letter to the House subcommittee considering the bill, Bush
wrote: ``How can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements
toward freedom in Eastern Europe, Latin America and elsewhere while
refusing to grant to our own citizens the right to
self-determination?''
   But the chances of passing such a bill in 1990 appear slim.
Action on the House version has been delayed by the illness of Del.
Ron de Lugo, D-V.I., chairman of the Interior subcommittee on
insular and international affairs.
   The bill's Senate counterpart, which has been approved by the
Energy and Commerce Committee, still must be considered by the
Finance, Agriculture and Judiciary committees before it can go to
the full body. And, because it's an election year, Congress is
hoping to adjourn earlier than usual.
   Still, the debate about who would vote continues, off the island
and on.
   Rafael Hernandez Colon, Puerto Rico's governor and leader of the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, has said he favors
allowing first-generation Puerto Ricans living in the United States
to vote in the plebiscite but believes most island residents oppose
the idea.
   And former Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo, of the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party, said any effort to determine who would be
eligible to vote would be a ``logistical nightmare.''
   Pena Clos noted that Puerto Rico has about 3.5 million people,
about 2.1 million of whom eligible to vote.
   ``How can 2.5 million people living in the United States be
allowed to affect the future of those on the island?'' he asked.
   Miguel Colom, who moved to New York 12 years ago, agrees that he
and others living here have no business voting on the island's
future.
   ``I'm an American. That's it,'' he said.
   ``Why should they vote if they live here? They're not affected
by what happens there. I know a lot of people who say, `I'm Puerto
Rican,' but if they sit down and think about it, they'll realize
they were born here, live here and work here. Why should they vote
there?''
   Gilberto Seda was born in New York. ``It's not that I don't care
about Puerto Rico; I do,'' he said. ``And it's not that I deny I'm
Puerto Rican. But my homeland is New York.''
   But Serrano said such thinking is too narrow. ``If this were the
United Nations, this would be easy to understand _ that there is a
nation of Puerto Ricans just as there is a nation of Jews around
the world and a nation of Palestinians,'' he insisted.
   Which is the same reasoning that Puerto-Rican born Yvette
Hernandez _ the non-voter _ uses in asserting her right to vote in
a plebiscite.
   ``I live here, but I'm Puerto Rican. So I should vote,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Bar Association Narrowly OKs Neutrality on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association is demonstrating how
deeply divided it is over taking a public stand on abortion, and
the future of its pro-choice policy remains in doubt.
   By a vote of 885-836 Monday, members at the ABA's Assembly
meeting adopted a resolution that supporters say is designed to
restore the nation's largest lawyers' group to a position of
neutrality on abortion.
   ``Questions presented by a decision to terminate pregnancy are
extremely divisive,'' the resolution said. ``The ABA for the good
of the association will not adopt a policy supportive of a
particular viewpoint.''
   The resolution urged repeal of a pro-abortion-rights stand
adopted by the ABA's policymaking body, its House of Delegates.
   That body will meet Wednesday to decide whether it should adopt
the recommendation and rescind its pro-choice stand approved in
February by a margin of better than 2-1.
   ABA Secretary-elect Anthony Palermo of Rochester, N.Y., sponsor
of the repeal resolution, said the narrow victory Monday is a good
sign that the ABA may be ready to abandon its position.
   ``This vote demonstrates how divisive this issue is. But it's
not over yet,'' he said. Palermo denied that rescinding the
pro-choice position would be ``a slap in the face'' to women in the
organization.
   Sally Determan of Washington D.C., a leader of the drive to
retain the policy favoring abortion rights, said she is not
disheartened by Monday's developments.
   ``I'm pleased the vote was this close,'' she said.
   If the House of Delegates reaffirms its previous policy, the
Assembly could reconvene and by a two-thirds vote force a
referendum by the ABA's 360,000 members.
   Monday's vote was preceded by nearly two hours of debate. Those
urging repeal of the pro-choice stand said adoption of the
resolution would not be interpreted as a vote against privacy
rights for women.
   But opponents of the resolution said backing away now from
support of abortion rights would damage the group's credibility.
   ``ABA members want the right to decide and speak for themselves
individually on abortion matters and they do not want the ABA to
adopt a policy of organization abortion advocacy,'' Palermo said.
   But Ms. Determan said, ``A great organization should never
recede from principle because of threats of resignations and
financial pressure.''
   She said the organization has a duty to speak out on the leading
issues of the day, no matter how controversial. The ABA's darkest
hour was in the 1950s when it remained silent over civil rights and
discrimination, she said.
   The abortion controversy has cost the ABA 1,500 members and
$300,000 in annual fees.
   The Assembly vote was open to any of the 12,000 association
members attending this week's annual convention who paid a $250
registration fee.
   The resolution adopted by the House of Delegates in February
said government should not interfere ``with the confidential
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician'' in
deciding on abortions.
   ABA members noted that being on record on the abortion issue put
the organization in position to express itself formally when state
legislatures and courts consider abortion laws.
   The repeal fight took on new significance with President Bush's
nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme Court.
   The ABA plays a key role in evaluating the qualifications of
high court nominees, and some opponents of the ABA's stand have
said the organization's role in judicial selection is now suspect.
They say the ABA could appear to be biased against a nominee who
opposes abortion.
   Souter's views on abortion are largely unknown.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who addressed the ABA on
Monday, told a news conference the organization would be wise to
restore its neutrality on abortion.
   ``Its credibility will suffer if the ABA takes a position on
every hot button issue of the day,'' he said.

   B.F. Skinner, the psychologist who
popularized behavior modification, is facing his approaching death
by leukemia with no regrets, a fitting end to a life he claimed was
governed by rational rules.
   Skinner, 86, is preparing what may be his final work, a defense
of controversial research that explored the uses of positive and
negative reinforcement to improve human behavior.
   ``I will be dead in a few months,'' Skinner said with a laugh.
``But it hasn't given me the slightest anxiety or worry or
anything; I always knew I was going to die.''
   For years, Skinner has endured a battering by many American
psychologists who scorned his belief that behavior could be
engineered to make society better. Not everyone will accept his
final work, he said in a recent interview.
   ``I'm writing a paper which is my summing up of what psychology
is all about and attacking cognitive psychologists,'' Skinner said.
``The cognitive psychologists won't like it, but that doesn't
bother me at all.''
   Cognitive psychology emphasizes the unconscious structures of
the human mind, rules for the brain's operation that can't be
explained by conditioning.
   Skinner's principle of ``operant behavior'' holds that even
seemingly spontaneous action is a response to rewards and
punishment. People don't shape the world, he has said. The world
shapes them.
   On Friday, Skinner is to be honored by the American
Psychological Association in Boston.
   The appearance will be tricky. The cancer has decimated
Skinner's immune system, and visitors to his Cambridge home must
wash their hands before meeting him.
   ``They're going to smuggle me up on the stage and then take me
right back out,'' Skinner said. ``I won't go to a reception and
shake anyone's hands.
   ``I suppose,'' he added with a chuckle, ``I could show up with
rubber gloves on.''
   Burrhus Frederic Skinner (B.F. to the world, Fred to his
friends) grew up in Susquehanna, Pa., and spent most of his career
at Harvard University, where he applied his observations of animals
to the motives and manipulation of human conduct. He retired from
the faculty in 1974.
   Skinner argued that ``behavioral technology'' could be put to
work to create a world free of overpopulation, war and pollution.
   In ``Walden Two,'' published in 1948, he described a tightly
controlled Utopia in which people are motivated by positive and
negative reinforcements. The novel was required reading for many
college students in the 1960s and 1970s.
   In Walden Two, everyone is happy. People don't know the meaning
of envy and jealousy. Buildings are communally owned, and everyone
helps out with chores.
   Many psychologists found Skinner's Walden to be a tyrannical
place _ others said it was bland. But his application of the ideas
of the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov have left an indelible
stamp on American society.
   ``We now know that many principles govern human behavior, not
just `operant behavior,' but that doesn't diminish his
importance,'' said Jerome Kagan, chairman of the Harvard psychology
department.
   Operant conditioning is used every day by parents, Kagan said,
``every time they praise a behavior they want and punish one they
don't want.''
   To his regret, Skinner may be best remembered for teaching
pigeons to play pingpong, using the Skinner Box. The pigeons
pressed buttons or levers to receive food in return for doing what
the experimenter wanted them to do.
   A Life magazine photograph of the pigeons hangs in Skinner's
wood-paneled study in his home. Nearby is a signed portrait of
Pavlov, whose experiment showed dogs could be conditioned to
salivate at the ring of a bell.
   Skinner's frame is lean but otherwise he shows little sign of
illness. His snow-white hair is combed back from an expansive
forehead and his blue-gray eyes sparkle when he discusses his work.
   He laments the search among cognitive psychologists for an
``inner creator'' responsible for human behavior, likening them to
creationists who scorn Darwin's theory of evolution.
   Skinner compares the search for an inner self to the search for
God. Skinner doesn't believe in God, either.
   And how does Skinner want to be remembered?
   ``Somebody asked my daughter recently what she remembered most
about me,'' he says. ``It was very strange. She said I used to come
and put her to bed and talk with her, and I'd take her hand and
there'd be tears in my eyes.''
   ``I'd hate to have people say he's the man who taught pigeons to
play pingpong.''

   The electrical worker from Czechoslovakia says
he must have met a hundred Americans in his 2{ months in America _
but everyone was too busy to become real friends.
   Whenever he talked to the owner of the Virginia publishing
company where he interned, ``I was seeing that the time was running
in his head.''
   The young lawyer from Poland bemoaned Americans' lack of
knowledge about Europe _ or even about America.
   In an after-hours competition with his fellow summer clerks at a
prestigious Washington law firm, he was able to name 45 states of
the union. The best any of his new Harvard-educated friends could
do was 36 or 37.
   These young East Europeans _ a translator, a civil engineer, a
law professor, a legal advisor to the Hungarian parliament, a
Polish radio and television worker and others, many of them with a
history of dissidence _ had been in America since mid-May, learning
the ropes of capitalism and democracy.
   They worked in banks, in bookstores, in congressional offices
and state government, chiefly in Washington and North Carolina,
side-by-side with American counterparts in a program run by the
non-profit National Forum Foundation. Recently, they spent the
morning discussing what they liked, what they disliked and what
surprised them.
   Piotr Kochanski, 28, a lawyer, was the Pole who outshined the
other summer clerks at Hogan &amp; Hartson by listing 45 states ``and
all the presidents of the U.S. in the 20th Century.'' He played
softball with the firm's young lawyers, but found it ``a boring
game.''
   What dismayed him was how little Americans in turn knew about
Europe. ``They know nothing about our country, our history, our
culture,'' he said.
   ``I was asked very funny questions many times,'' agreed Mirek
Kleber, a novice Polish businessman who speaks Russian, French and
German and interned with a bank in Lumberton, N.C. ``Do we have
television in Poland? Do we have cars?''
   On the other hand, Kochanski marveled, ``Americans can organize
something in an hour. Everybody has confidence in the others.
Everybody can trust one another. I love it _ this ability for
working together.''
   And he was struck by how Americans can tear down a perfectly
fine building ``and in two months a new beautiful building can go
up.''
   ``We have all this history in Poland,'' he said. ``I love this
history _ but I think we can learn from your creativity, your
pragmatism, this modern mentality.''
   ``I am from a city one thousand years old,'' said Beata
Kalczynska-Gasic, a civil engineer from Krakow. In Raleigh, N.C.,
where she worked with the state Department of Transportation, she
was shown a picture of the city. What struck her was that no
building was more than 40 years old.
   ``Americans seem to be running toward the future and don't look
back,'' she said. But, she asked, ``Where is the soul in your
cities?''
   Kalliope Bakirdzi, 31, press secretary for a new political party
in Hungary, the Alliance of Free Democrats, worked in the office of
the lieutenant governor of North Carolina and observed the
Democratic Senate primary campaign.
   She liked the civility of American politics, the acceptance of
compromise.
   ``Whatever you are _ Republican or Democrat _ you know there
will always be Republicans and Democrats and you have to get along
with the other side,'' she said.
   In Hungary, she said, ``We hate each other much more than is
needed for normal political life.''
   She was impressed, too, that American politicians can spend 80
percent of their time talking to, meeting, dealing with the voters.
``Our politicians never cared about the people,'' she said.
   But she was puzzled by the fuss over flag-burning in this
country.
   Recalling a television news report, she said, she was ``a little
shocked how they allowed the Ku Klux Klan to march but they try to
ban burning the flag. If you burn a flag, you don't hurt anybody,
but the Ku Klux Klan can hurt people.''
   Daria Golebiowska, 22, advertising director for a Warsaw fashion
house, interned at Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper. She liked
the way people assumed responsibility without direction.
   ``Everybody's working away,'' she said, describing a newsroom's
chaos. ``Everything seems to be so loose. People are coming in and
out and talking on the telephone. And suddenly a newspaper comes
out!
   ``This responsibility for their own work gives people a feeling
they are really important.''
   Jan Lamper, 35, a Czechoslovak worker at an electrical plant,
translator and former dissident, said he thinks Americans work too
hard, much harder than he expected. His friendships didn't have
time to develop.
   ``People are too busy to get involved deeper,'' he said.
``They're working all the time.''
   Andrzej Slaski, 35, a sanitary engineer from Poland, was struck
by the friendliness of the people of Raleigh.
   ``A lot of people in the street say, `hello,' `good morning,'
`hi,''' he said. In Poland, he said, that would happen only in a
village.
   And he couldn't get over of the purity of the water that emerged
from the modern North Carolina sewerage treatment plant he had
visited _ 99.8 percent pure, cleaner than river water. He kept
saying, ``99.8 percent clean!''
   Gabor Nagy, 29, legal adviser to Hungary's Alliance of Young
Democrats and teacher of sociology, worked in a congressman's
office and told of seeing how easily someone was fired for
incompetence. He wasn't dismayed.
   ``That's good!'' he exclaimed. ``This is a competitive society.
Our society was too egalitarian, socialist.''
   Nagy marvelled at the separation of powers, the disdain of the
legislative branch toward the executive branch of government.
   ``People's attitude toward power is not to obey,'' he said. ``It
is almost a kind of distrust of power. Lawmaking is always a
compromise, negotiations between different factions, finding a
common answer. This is very inspiring.''

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This land of immigrants opened its
doors wide after World War II, but now the ``Welcome'' on the mat
has begun to fade.
   Most Australians seem to feel they should continue showing
compassion for refugees, but resentment is increasing, particularly
toward Asians.
   Demonstrators protest large Japanese purchases of prime real
estate. Arriving boatloads of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees
raise fears of an uncontrollable flood from Southeast Asia.
   Several white-supremacist groups have sprung up. Six members of
the Australian Nationalists Movement are to face trial this year
for allegedly trying to drive Asians out with a terror campaign.
   Advocates of immigration say it generally has been positive for
Australia. They say most immigrants are young, with needed skills
and initiative, and provide new perspectives.
   Critics contend immigrants exacerbate pollution, unemployment,
housing and other problems.
   They also claim there is a trend away from assimilation. Some
city neighborhoods like Cabramatta, a Vietnamese district of
Sydney, have become virtual ethnic enclaves.
   A government decision allowing Chinese students, afraid to go
home after the pro-democracy movement was crushed, to stay in
Australia at least four years added to the immigration debate.
   No one was happy. The students wanted permanent-resident status
and other ethnic groups complained about an accompanying reduction
in their quotas.
   The Australian, a national daily newspaper, said the decision
demonstrated the lack of a coherent immigration policy and
described the government rules as ``a camel of a policy, a camel
being a horse designed by committee.''
   Australia's combination of large size and relatively small
population makes it appear ideal for growth. The land area of
3,073,000 square miles is roughly equal to the contiguous United
States, but Australia has only 17 million people, about
one-fifteenth the U.S. total.
   Environmentalists say that, unless the desert can be made to
bloom, it is more appropriate to compare Australia to Canada, with
its vast areas of nearly unusable tundra.
   Much of Australia's population is in the coastal cities, and
immigrants tend to settle there. Nearly half the people live in the
Sydney and Melbourne areas, and projections indicate rapid growth
will continue.
   Sydney's state, New South Wales, received 65,000 immigrants last
year, nearly triple the number in 1984.
   Nearly 40 percent of the immigrants live in Sydney, at least
initially. That has led to housing shortages and suburban expansion
that puts a greater burden on public transportation.
   Supporters of high immigration levels say foreigners are being
used as scapegoats by politicians unwilling to to make unpopular,
expensive decisions about housing and public services.
   Australians have been spoiled by a relative abundance of raw
materials, they say, and now are starting to pay the price.
   Since the end of World War II, the population has increased by
150 percent as part of a growth policy designed, in part, to make
Australia less susceptible to attack.
   About 500,000 of the new residents were refugees and Australia
gained a reputation as a haven for the homeless. It still takes
more refugees per capita than any other main resettlement country,
but the strains have begun to show.
   ``We are the last country ... to regard ourselves as the first
asylum country for refugees, and it's about time we changed our
view of ourselves,'' Luke Hardy, executive director of the Refugee
Council of Australia, said recently.
   ``Australia has tried to bathe in the luxury of going abroad to
select refugees from camps and then bringing them here under fixed
quotas every year,'' Hardy said.
   ``We can't just pretend we can go and find our own refugees. We
have to deal maturely and compassionately and methodically with
refugees claiming asylum on our shores and in our cities.''
   The refugee issue has led to friction with neighboring
countries, particularly Indonesia. Many boat people stop there en
route to Australia, often because their boats are unsafe, and end
up in refugee camps.
   Nearly 15,000 Vietnamese are housed in one camp on Galang, an
Indonesian island south of Singapore, and the number of Cambodian
refugees also is increasing.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a peace broker who had put his country's
weight and his personal standing on the line, President Hosni
Mubarak was deeply embarrassed by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   After Iraqi President Saddam Hussein aired his grievances
against Kuwait last month, Mubarak traveled to the capitals of
Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia on a single day in peacemaking
efforts.
   He returned home apparently heartened by what he called Iraqi
assurances of peaceful intentions. He proudly told reporters July
25 that Iraq and Kuwait would stop their war of words and hold
direct talks to settle their differences over oil and land.
   The talks collapsed after the first round of talks in Jiddah,
Saudi Arabia, on Aug. 1. The Iraqis invaded Kuwait the next day.
   The invasion undoubtedly was a let-down for Mubarak, who said he
had personal assurances from Saddam that he would not resort to
arms. Diplomats in Cairo said they had no doubt Mubarak was telling
the truth and that Saddam lied.
   Ibrahim Nafei, editor of the leading newspaper Al-Ahram and
known to be close to Mubarak, wrote: ``With the first shot fired at
Kuwait, Mubarak could have come out and laid bare before the Arab
people many shameful positions (by Iraq), but he preferred caution
and wanted the fire put out before it got out of hand.''
   He described Mubarak's feeling upon hearing of the invasion as
``very painful grief.''
   Mubarak himself, a courteous man who shuns scathing words,
rejected a reporter's suggestion Saturday that the invasion was a
stab in the back to him.
   He indicated he may have been deceived by Iraqi leaders. But
with his military background, he said he understood why Iraqi
leaders hid their invasion plans.
   ``Really I was very upset,'' Mubarak said. `` But I can't say it
is a stab in the back. If anybody is planning to make an invasion,
he will never say (so) exactly, otherwise he is going to spoil
everything.''
   But he was adamant on three things: Iraq must withdraw from
Kuwait, the Kuwaiti ruler Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah must be
reinstated, and the two countries must agree on ways to settle the
conflict peacefully.
   He spoke the day after his Foreign Ministry issued a statement
censuring the invasion and making the same demands.
   The statement came 24 hours after the invasion, and the interim
silence from Cairo caused surprise. Mubarak rejected a reporter's
suggestion this was because Egypt was afraid of Saddam's wrath.
   ``We could easily have given a very nervous statement right away
after the invasion, but we had to understand all the reasons and
make some effort,'' he said. ``Still the efforts are going on.''
   Underlying Cairo's caution was a sense of being torn between two
close friends.
   Egypt's predicament was summed up by columnist Anis Mansour in
the newspaper Al-Ahram.
   ``President Saddam took an entire nation hostage,'' he wrote.
``The Arab countries stood confused and at a loss, torn between the
murderer brother (Iraq) and the murdered brother (Kuwait). What is
our right hand going to do with our left hand, which has slapped us
on both cheeks and on the back of the neck, too?''
   The invasion has not deflected Mubarak from pursuing his drive
to settle the Iraq-Kuwait conflict peacefully. He wants this done
strictly within the Arab family.
   ``Arab leaders are capable of finding a solution to this problem
without any foreign intervention at all,'' he told reporters on
Saturday. ``We are doing our maximum ... and Arab efforts must
succeed.''

<HEAD>Thieves Terrorizing Train Station Battle Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gang of thieves preying on foreign
tourists at the Central Train Station engaged police in a running
battle and succeeded in freeing a colleague already under arrest, a
newspaper reported.
   The same gang is suspected of beating and slashing the husband
of an American Peace Corps worker July 30 as his family looked on.
   The incidents reflect the skyrocketing crime rate in Poland in
the year since the Communists lost power, partly because of the
hard economic times connected with the new Solidarity-led
government's economic reform program.
   The police force is being restructured, and crime-fighting units
in general are understaffed, underfunded and demoralized.
   Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest daily, reported Monday that
thieves rescued their handcuffed compatriot at about 6 a.m. Sunday
as he was being led away by two police officers.
   Later that morning, about 50 officers were confronted on an
empty platform by 20 gang members who challenged them to fight.
They charged the police and escaped.
   The day's final confrontation took place in the afternoon in a
nearby underground passage, Gazeta Wyborcza said. Fifteen officers
closed in on the thieves, who responded by shooting tear gas
pistols, throwing stones, and swinging boards broken off from
benches.
   Only one of the suspected gang members was apprehended, police
Maj. Wojciech Kinowski told The Associated Press on Monday.
   Police were armed with guns, clubs and spray cans of a Mace-like
irritant, but could not fire their pistols in the crowded station,
he said.
   On July 30, John Zukowski-Faust was attacked at the station
before boarding a train with his wife, Jean Zukowska-Faust,
associate director for education of the U.S. Peace Corps in Poland,
and their two teen-age children.
   Zukowski-Faust was sprayed with tear gas, cut in the face with a
knife and had his leg broken in two places. He is hospitalized in
London, said Peace Corps spokeswoman Hanna Grzedzicka on Monday.
   The gang working the train station watches for foreign tourists
and either assaults and robs them or uses other ruses, such as
creating a distraction while a colleague picks their pockets.
   Kinowski said police were not giving up, but ``will strengthen
our efforts'' to catch the gang.

<HEAD>U.S. Concerned about Safety of Foreigners Kidnapped in Liberia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are concerned about the safety
of 14 to 15 foreigners, including one American, who were kidnapped
from a Monrovia hotel by Liberian rebel troops and taken to an
insurgent headquarters.
   The action appeared to be part of a campaign by Prince Johnson,
the leader of one Liberian rebel faction, to provoke international
intervention in Liberia's civil war by seizing foreigners.
   He believes that such intervention will help topple the 10-year
rule of President Samuel K. Doe.
   The kidnapping occurred at the Hotel Africa on Monday, two days
after Johnson issued his warning. The captives were taken to
Johnson's headquarters in the town of Caldwell.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.
Embassy reported to the State Department late Monday, Liberia time,
that Johnson's forces ``have seized hostages.''
   She said there was no indication that any of the captives had
been harmed. No information on the identity of the American was
available except that he was in Monrovia as a private citizen.
   Despite Johnson's appeals for foreign intervention, the Bush
administration has adopted a hands-off policy and has called
repeatedly for a diplomatic solution.
   The insurgency against Doe is now in its eighth month and has
left the capital without public water, electricity or telephone
service. Food shortages have intensified.
   U.S. officials said they were worried that Johnson may resort to
even more extreme measures if the kidnappings do not provoke
foreign intervention. One concern is that his forces may launch
attacks on foreign embassies.
   The administration has been increasingly troubled by events in
Liberia since last week when government forces murdered hundreds of
civilians who had sought sanctuary at a Monrovia church.
   After Johnson issued his warning about kidnapping foreigners,
President Bush ordered the partial evacuation of foreigners. Among
the first group to be evacuated were 62 Americans and 12 other
foreigners.
   U.S. Marines operating from a flotilla of vessels offshore
evacuated an additional 20 people from Liberia on Monday, including
six Americans and 14 other foreigners, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The maneuver, code-named ``Sharp Edge,'' was launched from four
warships stationed in international waters off Liberia since early
June.
   The United States has made a standing offer to help Doe leave
the country, but he has shown no interest in accepting it.
   U.S. officials said they also understood that Nigeria and
perhaps other countries in West Africa were planning to evacuate
citizens stranded in Liberia.
   They said between 1,200 and 1,600 Nigerians have been camped out
at the Nigerian embassy compound and some are in ``dire
circumstances.''
   There also have been reports that Nigeria may attempt to send
troops to Liberia in an effort to stop the fighting and set up an
interim government. Nigeria has been working closely on the
Liberian issue with other countries from the Economic Community of
West African States.
   Community members include Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone,
Togo and Liberia.

   A naval blockade of Iraq would succeed in
choking off most of Saddam Hussein's oil exports and food imports,
experts say, but it carries the danger of drawing hostile fire from
the trapped Iraqis.
   A blockade is on the Bush administration's list of options to
punish Iraq for its invasion last week of neighboring Kuwait. To be
fully successful, the allies would need help from Turkey and
possibly Jordan to close off all trade to Iraq.
   But a naval blockade _ a tactic last used by the United States
during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis _ would not be without risk of
bloodshed. Iraq has French-made Exocet missiles, which proved
deadly in Iraq's attack against the USS Stark in 1987 and when used
by Argentina against British ships in the Falklands War.
   Any lengthy blockade likely would have the undesired effect of
driving up world oil prices, hurting the United States and other
Western economies. That could give Saddam a small victory even if
he was ultimate missiles instead of one.
   ``They would have a significant aerial capability to counter the
blockade, but their successes would be limited if we have three
carriers in the vicinity,'' Blackwell said. ``We'll dominate the
air over the seas and limit what the Iraqis could do.''
   But Blackwell and others, including a State Department analyst
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a successful economic
blockade would hinge on preventing Iraq from exporting oil through
land-based pipelines and from importing food through its neighbors.
   Iraq pipes oil across Turkey, and Turkish President Turgut Ozal
promised Monday to go along with a United Nations trade embargo
against Iraq.
   According to CIA data, Iraq imports about $13 billion in goods a
year, with Turkey its No. 1 trading partner. Other Iraqi trading
partners include the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan, the Soviet Union and Italy.
   It was a four-day blockade of Cuba in October 1962 that brought
the missile crisis to an end. President Kennedy warned the Soviet
Union that its ships would be boarded and inspected, and none
carrying weapons tried to cross through the U.S. ships. Moscow
ultimately agreed to withdraw its missiles from Cuba in exchange
for a U.S. promise not to invade.
   The U.S. Navy has not attempted a blockade since then, although
such actions were considered against North Vietnam, against Cuba
again during President Reagan's first term because of arms
shipments in Central America, and as recently as last January to
block cocaine shipments from Colombia.
   Six British ships were lost and 10 others damaged during the
blockade of the Falklands in 1982. But the blockade prevented food,
fuel and other supplies from reaching Argentine troops.

   The concert was called ``Blowin' in from
Chicago'' and it starred two tenor saxophonists born in the Windy
City, Johnny Griffin, 62, and Von Freeman, 67.
   Monday evening's ``Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center'' concert
was rooted in bebop, once considered too intellectual for mass
listeners, now become mainstream jazz.
   It proved that tunes composed by Griffin and Freeman, not often
heard, are as enjoyable as standards _ more enjoyable than some
overtired standards _ when played as well as their quartets played
them.
   Both men spoke entertainingly, while staying relaxed. Both sets
had variety of mood, including excitement, never pushed to hysteria.
   Alice Tully Hall held strong fans of the two musicians, who
aren't often heard here. Freeman and his pianist John Young usually
play in Chicago. On Monday, Ron Carter played bass and Billy
Higgins played drums with them.
   Griffin's tight quartet included Michael Weiss, piano, Dennis
Irwin, bass, and Kenny Washington, drums.
   Griffin, who lives in Europe, played first. He began with
Thelonious Monk's ``Evidence,'' played his own ``Chicago Calling,''
which swings lightly. He told a tale of a woman leaving him and
taking all his money, making it funny, said he ``heard three sad
notes in my mind's ear'' and wrote ``Woe Is Me.''
   The tune was a sweet, remote memory of melancholy rather than
anger or pain. The quartet cooked on ``Hot Sake'' and did an encore
which Griffin called ``a cross between honky tonk and blues with
strange changes.''
   Freeman's rhythm section played with inventive interaction. They
played ``After Dark,'' he said, although ``We about wore that one
out,'' for his son, tenor saxophonist Chico Freeman, whom he later
introduced.
   Then, saying, ``I usually heat things up before I get into this
but I feel like playing it,'' the quartet played the melodic ``Lost
in the Fog.'' Griffin joined them for the final two numbers, in
which the two saxophonists played in unison and traded solos,
building and driving but staying loose. They also traded
compliments. And the audience gave them a standing ovation.

<HEAD>Mayor Announces Plan to Enlarge Police Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spurred by a series of violent crimes, Mayor
David Dinkins announced plans to ``take back our streets'' by
hiring 1,058 more police officers, most of them to walk the beat.
   Dinkins on Monday said he ``scraped, scratched and squeezed''
$24 million out of the city's $27.8 billion budget to pay for the
additions to the 26,000-member force.
   The mayor said he wants to change the ``image people have that
they are not safe in our town.''
   Among recent events that have put Dinkins under pressure have
been the slayings of four children by stray bullets and the
killings of an advertising executive making a call from a pay phone
and a 14-year-old shot over a moped.
   In addition, 19 cab drivers have been killed this year.
   On Monday, a sleeping baby was wounded by a bullet that went
through the wall of his apartment. The bullet cracked his skull but
didn't penetrate his brain, said Judy Murphy, spokeswoman for St.
Luke's Hospital. Police had no suspects.
   ``We will take back our streets by night as well as by day
because a safe New York, at peace and free of fear, is the legacy
we intend to leave our children,'' Dinkins said.
   The mayor's proposal will be presented to the City Council on
Wednesday for approval.
   ``We think that this is not only the right direction to go, but
what the people of the city expect,'' said City Council Speaker
Peter F. Vallone.
   Most of the new officers would walk beats, Dinkins said. The
police force now includes 10 community patrol officers in each of
the 75 precincts.
   Last month, more than 1,100 officers were shifted from
specialized units into seven high-crime precincts. An additional
200 senior officers were assigned to overtime duty in Operation
Take-Back in those areas.

   The African National Congress'
29-year guerrilla campaign intended to force the white minority
government to negotiate with the black majority and end apartheid.
   It was never designed to topple the vast power of the white
state. And it never came close.
   The ANC military wing never engaged in a battle with the South
African army and seldom attacked any fortified or military
installation.
   The ANC camps in neighboring countries could not fight off South
African Defense Force raids, which were mounted with helicopters
and bombers.
   But hundreds of civilians, policemen, guerrillas and soldiers
were killed and injured in bombings, grenade attacks, police raids
and in township shootouts. During an ANC urban bombing campaign
from 1984 to 1989, 37 people were killed and 680 injured.
   Early today, ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela announced the
cessation of all armed action by the guerrilla organization he
helped found in 1961.
   During his 1964 trial on charges of sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government, Mandela said that ANC's armed wing, Spear
of the Nation, ``was to perform sabotage; and strict instructions
were given to its members right from the start, that on no account
were they to injure or kill people.''
   When he was released from prison in February, and asked about
the civilian casualties from the urban bombs, Mandela replied that
the country was at war, and civilians sometimes were killed in the
crossfire.
   Mandela's changed attitude reflected the different goals the
military wing commanders had been given by the ANC leadership
during Mandela's 27 years in prison. The first fatal bombing for
which the ANC claimed responsibility occurred a few months after
Mandela was sentenced to life in prison.
   Mandela had said in 1964 that ``planned destruction of power
plants, and interference with rail and telephone communications''
would scare away foreign capital and ``make it more difficult for
goods from the industrial areas to reach the seaports on schedule.''
   Mandela and the other early guerrilla commanders hoped economic
disruption would cause whites to reconsider their support of
apartheid.
   In 1988, after a series of bombs in shopping malls and
restaurants, ANC commander Chris Hani explained the new Spear of
the Nation reasoning: ``We want to make apartheid costly, and very
painful and bitter for whites.''
   ANC leaders suggested that frightened whites would turn against
their leaders and force them to negotiate with the ANC.
   But even such as Helen Suzman, a member of Parliament for the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, noted ``no sign of any
fear or trepidation as a result.'' She said the ANC had
underestimated the determination of the white minority to stay in
power and the ``ferocity'' of the reprisals the government would
take.
   Security police bragged that they had informers at the highest
levels of the ANC, and the government arrested scores of
guerrillas, many of whom were hanged. There were several cases of
guerrillas blowing themselves up.
   Many also died in police custody.
   Each new bomb brought a vow from former President P.W. Botha
that he would never negotiate with ``terrorists.'' The last major
bombing attributable to the ANC occurred in August 1989 after
President F. W. de Klerk had come to power.
   He reversed Botha's policy by legalizing the ANC and freeing
Mandela before they met the long-standing government demand to
renounce violence.
   ANC leaders other than Spear of the Nation commanders were often
ambivalent about their support of, and reasons for, bombings and
grenade attacks.
   The exiled leadership in Lusaka, Zambia, rarely acknowledged
that any bombing had been committed by Umkhonto we Sizwe.
   They often said the guerrillas were operating across the border
and underground, and couldn't be kept track of.
   They said some bombs, such as one that exploded in a bar
frequented only by blacks, may have been left by untrained
activists. They also said the police caused some explosions.

<HEAD>Consumer Food Prices Seen Rising Faster Than Anticipated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising consumer food prices are set to make
news again, with or without the Mideast war jitters and threats of
inflation, Agriculture Department analysts say.
   The freezing weather that ripped into Texas and Florida last
Christmas boosted fruit and vegetable prices more than anyone in
USDA had anticipated, says Denis Dunham of the department's
Economic Research Service.
   By itself, the freeze damage was enough to drive up overall food
prices sharply in the first three months of 1990.
   Vegetable prices came down later as more production came into
line, but fruit prices are still high and will continue that way
until the new crop is ready.
   Last fall, USDA forecast 1990 food prices, on the average, would
rise 3 percent to 5 percent during the year. But that was before
the December freeze.
   Further, Dunham said Monday in a telephone interview, livestock
and dairy prices are up, particularly hogs and milk. That has put
more upward pressure on retail prices this year.
   ``We started off thinking commodity prices would be pretty flat
(this year),'' Dunham said. ``But hogs and milk are higher than we
thought, and cattle gained a bit more, too.''
   Retail food prices gained 5.8 percent in 1989, on the average,
the most since 1981. This year's increase is expected to be even
sharper, although USDA won't announce the new forecast until Aug.
17.
   Some analysts have said, however, that a revised forecast of 6
percent to 8 percent is in the works, while other have speculated
that an increase of 8 percent to 10 percent may be more like it.
   While Dunham and other agency economists attribute the sharper
increase on higher prices at the farm gate, they also concede
quickly that the farm price of most raw commodities is a fraction
of what consumers pay at retail.
   ``Farm prices are very volatile'' and can swing widely in a
short time, Dunham said. But the ``marketing spread'' of prices
between farmers and consumers creeps higher each year.
   The spread includes the costs of transportation, processing,
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm.
   ``While the farm price is going up and down, that spread is just
persistently going up _ and contributing all the time to that
increase in retail prices,'' Dunham said.
   Farmers and their advocates frequently quote USDA ``market
basket'' figures showing how little producers realize from consumer
food dollars.
   In 1989, Dunham said, the farm value of a marketbasket of foods
sold at grocery stores represented 30 cents of each $1 spent by
consumers for food, unchanged from 1987 and 1988.
   The 30-cent farm share of the food dollar also was the lowest
since 1950, according to USDA, and Dunham said it probably will be
about the same in 1990.

   Prospects of large soybean crops in Brazil and
other Southern Hemisphere countries probably made U.S. farmers
leery about expanding bean acreages this year, says a Agriculture
Department report.
   In March, a planting survey showed farmers would cut the U.S.
soybean acreage by 2 percent from last year, the department's
Economic Research Service said in the August issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine. But the most recent estimate puts the 1990
acreage down 4 percent.
   The weather also was a big factor, the report said. Over the
entire United States, May was the sixth wettest since 1895.
   Rainfall was especially heavy during the second quarter in
Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri and Oklahoma.
   ``In sharp contrast, some durum wheat growers and North Dakota
and Montana are experiencing their third consecutive year of
abnormally dry weather,'' the report said.
   Many thought the heavy rainfall would cause farmers to switch
from corn to sorghum or soybeans, which are less vulnerable to
midsummer heat. Also, soybeans mature faster than corn.
   ``But the weather improved in the first two weeks of June, and
many farmers got their corn into the ground quickly,'' the report
said. ``Farmers' decisions to proceed with late corn were
apparently based on expectations of strengthening corn prices and
weakening soybean prices relative to benefits from the corn
program.''
   Ironically, the report added, decisions to hold back on soybean
plantings ``have now pushed up soybean futures prices.''

   Agriculture Department scientists say low-fat
hamburgers can be made tender and juicy by adding potato starch.
   Potato starch gel is now used as a thickener in salad dressings.
When mixed with the meat, the gel helps bind the water to the meat.
   ``Burgers containing the additive actually cook faster than pure
beef,'' said the department's Agricultural Research Service. ``The
faster cooking and increased moisture retention created cooked
patties with 4.5 percent less fat than cooked all-beef burgers.''
   The starch-gel has been approved for use in food by the Food and
Drug Administration but would have to be approved for its specific
use in meat by FDA and the USDA before it can be sold for public
consumption.

   Singer Janet Jackson postponed two concerts
this week in Detroit after passing out backstage in the middle of a
St. Louis show.
   Jackson, 24, collapsed Sunday after singing three songs. She was
taken to a hospital, treated for an acute viral infection and
released, Kathleen Heinz, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Arena,
said Monday.
   A doctor recommended Jackson not perform for at least four or
five days, Heinz said.
   Jackson, the sister of Michael Jackson, has suffered from
exhaustion during her tour and had come down with a fever and an
ear infection that caused dizziness the day before she passed out,
Heinz said.
   The Detroit concerts had been scheduled for today and Wednesday
but were moved to Aug. 22 and 23.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Down 0.5 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes slipped 0.5 percent in
the second quarter from a year ago as psychological paralysis
gripped homebuyers, a real estate trade group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes, town houses, apartment condominiums and
cooperatives totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.68
million, compared with 3.70 million units during the same period in
1989.
   ``The second-quarter resale statistics reflect a slightly
stalled housing market, caused in small part by regional economic
downturns and in large part by a psychological paralysis that has
gripped consumers,'' said Realtors President Norman D. Flynn.
   ``The credit crunch, which primarily has affected builders, has
stirred fear on the part of homebuyers,'' he added. ``Also, there
has been a perception this year, which is totally unfounded, that
we are on the brink of a national housing recession.''
   But Flynn said when mortgage interest rates began falling in
May, buyers resumed house hunting, particularly in areas with
relatively affordable prices.
   ``People have started jumping in where the water's not too
deep,'' he said.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the average
cost of a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage was 10.67 percent during the
first week in May and dropped to 10.15 percent by the end of June.
   The Realtors' survey also found the median price of an existing
home ranging from $345,000 in Honolulu to $45,100 in Youngstown,
Ohio. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half
less.
   California's high-cost markets remained among the most
expensive, however. San Francisco with a $263,600 price;
Anaheim-Santa Ana, $248,900, and Los Angeles, $216,900, ranked
second, third and fourth, respectively.
   But overall, prices in the West declined 0.8 percent to
$138,300, while they rose 5.8 percent in the Midwest to $75,000.
The median price rose 1.5 percent to $86,200 in the South but fell
1.6 percent to $143,500 in the Northeast.
   The U.S. median price was $96,200, a 3.4 percent increase.
   By region, sales fell by 14.5 percent to 650,000 units at an
annual rate in the Northeast and 3.1 percent to 620,000 units in
the West. Sales gained 4.4 percent to 1.41 million units in the
South and 4.2 percent to 990,000 units in the Midwest.

   Saddam Hussein's vow to defeat any challenge
of his stranglehold on Kuwait carries an implied threat to use
chemical weapons, American experts say. After all, he's used them
before _ even on his own countrymen.
   The experts interviewed Monday said they saw little reason for
the Iraqi president to resort to using mustard gas and other
elements of his chemical arsenal. But they said President Bush, in
contemplating military action to force Iraq out of Kuwait, would
have to consider the possibility of a chemical response.
   ``The Iraqis have used chemical weapons before and have
threatened to use them again; therefore it would be perilous in any
military plan not to consider the possibility again,'' said Brian
Jenkins, a terrorism expert at Kroll Associates, a consulting firm
in Los Angeles.
   Elisa Harris, a chemical weapons specialist at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said there are no
reliable estimates of the size of Iraq's chemical arsenal. But
there's no doubt that it is substantial, she said.
   ``Iraq is probably the most powerful chemical country in the
region,'' she said.
   Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon official and now director of
the Center for Security Policy, a private research firm, said he
believed it likely that Saddam would use chemical weapons if he
attacked Saudi Arabia and met stiff resistance.
   ``They have about as good an understanding'' of the military use
of chemicals as anyone in the world, Gaffney said.
   Israeli media reported Sunday that the Israeli army was stepping
up its distribution of gas masks to civilians in response to the
invasion of Kuwait. Israel is not directly involved in the
conflict, but last spring Saddam threatened to ``scorch half of
Israel with poison gas'' if Israel attacked Iraq with nuclear arms.
   The use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, but Iraq repeatedly demonstrated during its eight-year
war against Iran that it is willing to use its arsenal, which is
believed to include mustard gas and other nerve agents.
   In March 1988 the Iraqi military used poison gas in attacking
Halabja, an Iraqi village in the Kurdish section of the country,
after the town was captured by Iranian forces. Doctors who treated
survivors said mustard gas, cyanide gas and other nerve agents were
used, causing burns to skin, eyes and lungs.
   In response to a worldwide condemnation of its invasion, Iraq
warned other countries not to come to Kuwait's aid. Baghdad Radio
said Iraqi armed forces would make Kuwait ``a graveyard for those
who launch any aggression.''
   On Saturday in Washington, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Sadiq
Mashat, said without mentioning the United States by name that any
attempt by outside nations to try to restore the Kuwaiti royal
family to power ``will be thoroughly dealt with.''
   Bush has not ruled out using military force against Iraq. The
president has all but committed himself to deploying U.S. troops to
the Arabian Peninsula in the event of an Iraqi attack on Saudi
Arabia, the most important American ally in the region and supplier
of 15 percent of U.S. oil imports.
   Bush said at a joint press conference with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher last Thursday that he agreed with Mrs.
Thatcher's statement that Iraq's chemical capability does not limit
Western military options against Iraq.
   ``You cannot have a situation where one country marches in and
takes over another country which is a member of the United
Nations,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``I don't think the particular
weapons they have affects that fundamental position.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, says he
thinks a subcommittee he chairs has established the legal basis to
overturn a 1988 savings and loan bailout he describes as ``very
sweet.''
   Arizona insurance executive James M. Fail acknowledged on Monday
there were inaccuracies and omissions in disclosure statements he
signed before acquiring 15 failed thrifts, now operating under the
name Bluebonnet Savings Bank, Dallas.
   One of the penalties for improper disclosure is removal as S&amp;L
owner.
   ``I believe there is enough to reopen and renegotiate the
contract. The real issue is can we save the taxpayers millions and
possibly billions of dollars. I believe the answer is yes,''
Metzenbaum told reporters after an all-day session of his Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust.
   Fail acknowledged omissions in documents filed initially with
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board concerning fraud allegations
leveled against him in 1976 in Alabama. However, he said that
before the bailout deal was signed on Dec. 22, 1988, he fully
disclosed the relevant details.
   Former senior regulators who testified to the subcommittee
previously said they did not know all of the details of the fraud
allegations and that if they had, Fail would have been disqualified.
   Metzenbaum said the Bluebonnet deal and other bailouts completed
in a headlong rush at the end of 1988 were ``very sweet,''
virtually assuring S&amp;L acquirers a profit from generous government
subsidies.
   ``The regulators couldn't possibly have known what they were
doing in the hustle and bustle,'' he said.
   In the Bluebonnet transaction, Metzenbaum is scrutinizing the
role of GOP lobbyist Robert Thompson, who represented Fail in
negotiations with regulators. Thompson was an aide to President
Bush when he served as vice president.
   Thompson, who had been fighting the panel's subpoena, appeared
briefly at the hearing, delivered documents and read a prepared
statement. He is scheduled to be questioned by the panel Sept. 11.
   The lobbyist continues to dispute the subcommittee's
jurisdiction, but said, ``I do not want to give any one any excuse
to say that my absence from these proceedings indicates I have
something to hide.''
   Thompson said his representation of Fail ``followed all rules of
propriety'' and ``not one word has been uttered, not one fact has
been disclosed, that suggests I did anything improper.''
   He said he was promised 2 percent of Fail's profits in the deal
but has received nothing because Bluebonnet has yet to pay a stock
dividend. Fail disputes him, saying he knew that would be an
improper arrangement under federal regulations.
   In the Alabama case, Fail was indicted on fraud charges, which
were subsequently dismissed, and a company he controlled, United
Security Holding Co., pleaded guilty to fraud and paid a $5,000
fine. As part of the settlement, Fail agreed not to conduct
insurance business in Alabama.
   Fail said he reported the details in a Dec. 18 letter to Thomas
Lykos, then in charge of the bank board's bailout program in the
Southwest. Fail said that on Dec. 19 he sent an attorney to New
York to further discuss the case with regulators.
   ``We went out of our way to see that it was disclosed,'' he
said, adding that hiding the incident ``would be like trying to
slip an elephant into a girls' dormitory.''
   However, Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
complained that the disclosures were confusing, made at the last
minute and buried in fine print.
   ``You didn't put in the part that made you look bad,'' Specter
added.
   Fail acknowledged that he had signed the original incomplete
disclosure documents but said they had been prepared by his staff
and he did not read them closely. He also admitted he did not
disclose civil suits that were connected to the Alabama criminal
indictment.
   ``I had a very bad habit in the past, which I can assure you I
will not have in the future, of signing a great many things which
are placed before me,'' Fail said.
   Monday's session was the third held by the Metzenbaum panel.
Just before Fail took his place at the witness table, Thomas K.
Pennington, former president of an insurance company controlled by
Fail, said Fail and a top aide, Harry Carneal, believed they
couldn't lose in the Bluebonnet bailout.
   ``They felt it was a no-brainer _ that they'd have to be awful
stupid not to make money,'' Pennington said.

   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat said
recently his priority was ``reversing a tide of unflattering press
reports'' about his country. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is
definitely setting things back.
   ``Everything has to be suspended, put on hold until the place
settles down,'' said Ron Cathell, executive director of the
National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations. His group sponsors
frequents visits to Iraq for educators, members of Congress and
other policymakers.
   Such efforts at U.S.-Iraq business, government and cultural ties
were cut off by Iraq President Saddam Hussein's overthrow of
Kuwait, and a spokesman for one U.S.-Iraq group says the small
Iraqi community in the United States is on the defensive.
   Iraq had tried to polish its image in this country since
diplomatic ties resumed five years ago. But even before the
invasion, the State Department had been weighing whether to place
Iraq on the list of countries that support terrorism.
   Despite al-Mashat's earlier comments to Dossier magazine about
building better Iraq-U.S. ties, he has declined repeated requests
for interviews since last Thursday's invasion.
   He invited reporters to the Iraq Embassy twice since Thursday
but has declined to answer extensive questions. On Monday, he tried
to evade reporters at the State Department after Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly summoned him to ask about the fate of
Americans in Kuwait.
   Faisal Arabo, head of the Iraqi-American Foundation _ a
Detroit-based group that tries to promote understanding and good
will between Americans and Iraqis _ conceded, ``We're doing a lousy
job.''
   Arabo, who produces a television program titled ``Arab Voice,''
said there are about 200,000 Iraqi-Americans in the United States,
including about 70,000 in the Detroit area. Many of them are upset
by world developments, he said.
   ``The Iraqis are somehow starting to think they can't speak
their mind,'' he said. ``We hate to see this relationship with
strife.''
   Personal relations between Iraqis and Americans generally have
been friendly and cordial despite the diplomatic strains, he said.
Iraqis have never harbored strong anti-American sentiments of the
kind that developed among Shiite Moslem religious fanatics in
neighboring Iran.
   Arabo estimated there are several hundred Iraqi students
studying in the United States.
   Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said the agency was working to develop an official head
count, although no official action has been taken against the
students.
   More serious, to some, was President Bush's cutoff of commercial
relations between the two countries following the invasion.
   ``The executive order has stopped all business,'' said Marshall
Wiley, head of the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum, a group that
represents American companies seeking to do business in the
oil-rich country.
   Wiley said the forum, supported by about 70 dues-paying American
companies, is trying to help them avoid serious financial losses as
a result of the order.
   For instance, the forum wants to find out what happens to Iraqi
oil that has been purchased by Americans, but remains on the high
seas in tankers. Wiley said he can't predict whether his group will
disband after some of those problems are resolved.
   The Commerce Department estimated that in 1989, Iraq bought
goods worth $1.1 billion from the United States, mostly food. By
comparison, the United States purchased about $2.4 billion from
Iraq, mostly oil.
   Few Iraqi businessmen are based in the United States because
most trade is through Iraq's government, he said.
   Wiley said his biggest concern was that the Bush
administration's steps to punish Saddam might backfire, making him
a hero in the eyes of other Arab states and spawning deep-seated
bad feelings towards the United States.
   If that is the case, American businesses could find themselves
shut out of expanding opportunities in Iraq and other Arab
countries, he said.
   In addition, Wiley said he doubted that a broad sanctions
program orchestrated by the United States would work. ``Other
countries will start cheating, but we won't,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto rose to power with the
blessings of Pakistan's powerful army generals. Some say she fell
that way too.
   After 20 months in office, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan abruptly
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government on Monday, citing corruption and
failure to control ethnic violence in the prime minister's home
province of Sindh.
   Although 11 years of military rule ended on Aug. 17, 1988, the
army still casts a long shadow on Pakistan's infant democracy. And
most politicians, diplomats and political analysts say Ishaq Khan
would not have dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government without the
military's consent.
   Most who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Mustafa Jatoi as
head of the caretaker government were Pakistan's most powerful
military men _ the army chief of staff, the joint chief of staff,
the air force and naval chiefs of staff and the corps commanders.
   Immediately after the president's announcement, soldiers were
deployed throughout the federal capital and took control of the
state television network and the telephone and telex exchanges,
cutting off foreign circuits.
   The army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, insisted the
military was only trying to maintain peace, not take power.
   ``We are not involved in politics. We have never been involved
in politics. We are not going to get involved in politics,'' Beg
said before the swearing-in ceremony.
   The relationship between Ms. Bhutto and the army _ which has
ruled Pakistan for 25 of its 43-year history _ has never been
smooth. But it went into a nosedive in late May.
   From prison and then from exile in England, Ms. Bhutto spent a
decade fighting Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who overthrew her father
in a 1977 coup and ordered him hanged two years later. But she was
forced to call out the army when ethnic violence flared anew in
Sindh and claimed more than 400 lives.
   The army blamed members of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party
for the violence and demanded sweeping powers to maintain order and
to arrest, try and convict troublemakers.
   Ms. Bhutto refused, setting an army that never became accustomed
to being out of power on an apparent collision course with a
government that never seemed to get used to having it.
   The 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto, educated at Harvard and Oxford, was
one of the best political stories of the 1980s.
   When Zia died in a mysterious plane crash on Aug. 17, 1988,
clearing the way for the first democratic elections in a decade,
Ms. Bhutto led her party to victory. She became the first woman to
lead a modern Moslem nation.
   But in order to gain the job she wanted, Ms. Bhutto had to make
certain concessions to the military, including hands-off on foreign
policy, particularly in Afghanistan, and defense spending. She
agreed.
   ``Benazir Bhutto was created from the rib of Aslam Beg and she
fell from the rib of Aslam Beg,'' one diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   Senior Cabinet members had repeatedly accused the army of trying
to destablize her democratically elected government.
   Army officers, on the other hand, did not hide their contempt
for Ms. Bhutto's party, accusing members of blatant corruption and
involvement in criminal activity.
   A meeting last month between Ms. Bhutto and Beg failed to
resolve their differences.
   Against Beg's advice, Ms. Bhutto extended the tenure of a
lieutenant general. The military high command saw it as a blatant
attempt to divide the army and win the political support of some
officers by patronizing them.
   Ms. Bhutto suffered a serious setback when Beg forced the
officer to retire.
   Although Ms. Bhutto's government was caught off guard on Monday,
political opponents had said privately for weeks that Ishaq Khan
planned to dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections,
possibly as early as October.
   Ishaq Khan set an election for Oct. 24 and declared a state of
emergency for up to four months that allows the president and the
caretaker government to make laws and to suspend individual rights
and civilian courts.
   Ms. Bhutto got few favorable marks from Pakistanis. Her
government passed no legislation except for a federal budget and
spent most of its energy fending off a hostile opposition and
corruption charges.
   Her popular support, rated at 54 percent when she took office,
had steadily been eroded by the mounting accusations of corruption,
which were never proved. But a poll released last month showed her
popularity had tumbled to 34 percent.
   Late Monday, Ms. Bhutto told a news conference she didn't blame
the president for bringing down her government, saying there were
``other elements who wanted me out.''
   She urged party members to accept the decision and refrain from
doing anything that would prompt another phase of martial law.

<HEAD>Report Says Lives Of Thousands Of Infants Could Be Saved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Existing medical skills could save the lives
of 10,000 babies each year and protect an additional 100,000 from
disabilities if the United States can find way to assure proper
care is delivered, according to an administration report.
   The draft report's conclusions are similar to those reached over
the past few years by other groups, including a congressionally
chartered commission headed by former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles
of Florida, and by the Institute of Medicine.
   It found that some pregnant women don't get needed medical care
for themselves and their unborn children because they can't afford
it and that, for a variety of reasons, others do not obtain the
care for which their eligible.
   ``For some women who need assistance and qualify for it, the
complexity of the Medicaid qualifying process itself ...
constitutes a barrier to care,'' the report says. ``Applications
can be lengthy (they average 14 pages) and require more
verification that a tax return.''
   Copies of the draft report by the White House Task on Infant
Mortality have been leaked by those who complain that the Bush
administration has shelved the study. The New York Times carried an
account in its Monday editions.
   Another copy was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
   ``We are anxious to see a final report out of the president,
followed by leadership,'' Chiles, chairman of the National
Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, said Tuesday in a statement.
   Chiles said an additional annual expenditure of $500 million, or
``only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total spending annually on
personal health care in the U.S.,'' could put recommendations of
the report into effect.
   Sixty percent of the babies who die before their first birthdays
weighed less than 5.5 pounds at birth, the report said.
   Another common characteristic is they come from poor families.
Other contributing reasons include maternal alcohol and drug abuse,
poor diet, and smoking.
   ``By applying the knowledge it already has this country can
prevent an additional 10,000 infant deaths and an estimated 100,000
disabling conditions in the newborn,'' the report said.
   Some 40,000 infants die each year in the United States before
reaching the first birthday and an additional 400,000 are
handicapped by mental retardation or physical problems, the report
said.
   Slightly fewer than 4 million babies are born in the United
States every year.
   In 1987 the U.S. infant mortality rate was 10.1 deaths per 1,000
live births, a rate bettered by 21 other industrial countries and
twice the rate in Japan and Scandinavia. For blacks the rate was
17.9 deaths and for whites it was 8.6 deaths.
   Those rates have been declining, but the report noted that the
rate of decline for blacks has slowed. And the fetal death rate for
blacks went up 2.7 percent in 1987, the first increase since the
1960s.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the study began in July
1989 and there is no due date for its completion.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Psychologist's Tapes Can Be Used in Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Carving out an exception to the
therapist-client privilege, a judge ruled conversations between a
psychologist and two brothers charged with murdering their parents
can be used at trial.
   The ruling Monday covers tapes of psychotherapy sessions held
between Erik and Lyle Menendez and their psychologist, L. Jerome
Oziel, after the slayings.
   The sessions ``concern the brothers' emotional and psychological
state after the murder of their parents,'' Superior Court Judge
James Albracht said.
   Albracht said Oziel had believed the brothers made threats
during the sessions and it was necessary to disclose the
conversations to prevent danger. The judge said that such a threat
constitutes an exception to the psychologist-patient privilege.
   The ruling provoked a gasp in the courtroom from the Menendez
family.
   The defense said it would appeal to the California Supreme Court
if necessary to prevent the tapes from being used in the brothers'
prosecution.
   Normally, conversations between a patient and therapist or
between a priest and penitent are not admissible.
   ``If the judge's ruling is upheld it brings a virtual end to the
psychotherapist-patient privilege,'' said defense attorney Leslie
Abramson.
   Deputy District Attorney Elliott Alhadeff expressed confidence
the ruling would be upheld.
   He added, however, ``We consider it to be very important
evidence, but it is not crucial to the case.''
   Erik Menendez, 19, and Lyle Menendez, 22, are charged with the
shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, at the
family's Beverly Hills mansion last August in a scheme to collect
the couple's $14 million fortune. Jose Menendez was president of a
video production company.
   The brothers remain in jail without bail. They could face the
death penalty if convicted.
   Ms. Abramson said Albracht based his ruling on a recent court
decision that held that if a psychotherapist discusses a patient's
statements with someone else, the privilege disappears.

   Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing
now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated
bogeymen: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   A Monday headline: ``We warned you Frankenstein would torment
his own creators.''
   Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 after a series of border
skirmishes, spawning a war that dragged until an August 1988
cease-fire. The conflict has still not formally ended.
   Iran's late fundamentalist patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, vowed for years to unseat Saddam. Never at a loss for a
vivid phrase, he compared accepting the cease-fire with Saddam to
drinking poison.
   The status of Great Satan was reserved for the United States,
the all-encompassing public enemy No. 1 for the Islamic Republic.
   Iran frequently accuses both the U.S. and Saddam of trying to
undermine the Islamic revolution.
   Saddam conveniently boasts of having alone staunched the tide of
radical Islam. In fact one of his reasons for invading Kuwait on
Thursday, the Iraqi press noted, was its gall in demanding back
tens of billions of dollars loaned to Iraq during the war Saddam
says he fought for all Arabs.
   Over the past six months, successful U.N.-sponsored efforts
toward face-to-face negotiations between Iraq and Iran robbed
Iranian newspapers and television commentators of a favorite target.
   Saddam's overthrow of the emir of Kuwait changed all that.
   Old scores came brimming to the surface. Kuwait, after all,
reflagged tankers in the United States during the Iran-Iraq war,
ushering in the reason for the arrival of the U.S. Navy in the
Persian Gulf in force.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency printed excerpts
Mondya of an editorial from the Ettela'at newspaper that was
headlined: ``Foster child turns rapaciously on nourisher Kuwait.''
   It noted that Kuwait had blindly supported Iraq, ``little
knowing that it was feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood.''
   Saddam has also been called generalissimo and The Invader.
   Under the Frankenstein headline, IRNA said in its own commentary:
   ``For the time being, tiny Kuwait ... breathes no more. With its
sheikh a stateless person, and its powerful dinar which bankrolled
the Iraqi military mere garbage, Kuwait is a nonentity, swallowed
up by the dangerous pet it reared.''
   Despite all the attention to the dangerous pet, the Great Satan
has not been forgotton. According to Iran's pundits, the Great
Satan planned it all. It wanted to get the Navy back in the Persian
Gulf.

<HEAD>Bodyguard Convicted in Slaying of Tourists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bodyguard has been convicted in the
slayings of two American tourists he mistook for U.S. agents after
they wandered into a restaurant celebration by Mexican drug
traffickers.
   Monday's verdict against Javier Vasquez Velasco was the last in
the latest trial over the slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena. The case has strained U.S. relations with Mexico and
entangled more than 40 people in the two countries.
   Vasquez, 38, portrayed by federal prosecutors as a drug lord's
bodyguard, was convicted of two counts of violent crimes in aid of
racketeering in the 1985 slayings of John Walker and Alberto
Radelat in a Guadalajara restaurant.
   Prosecutors said Walker and Radelat were mistaken for drug
agents after they wandered into a party for drug kingpins.
   Vasquez was not charged in the Camarena case but was tried with
three other men who were. Those three were convicted earlier.
   ``We can take no pleasure in the final outcome of this trial,
due to the grisly events outlined by the evidence presented,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``However, there is justice in the fact that many of those
responsible for the brutal kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA
Special Agent Enrique `Kiki' Camarena have now been held
accountable for their dreadful acts.''
   Vasquez could get life in prison at sentencing Oct. 29.
   His lawyer fought to have his trial separated from that of the
other defendants. But U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ruled the
two cases were sufficiently related to try them together.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were abducted,
tortured and killed in 1985 at a ranch outside Guadalajara.
   Prosecutors said the slayings were revenge for Drug Enforcement
Administration raids on marijuana and cocaine operations that cost
the drug barons $5 billion in profits.
   Earlier in the trial, Ruben Zuno Arce, brother-in-law of former
Mexican President Luis Echeverria, was found guilty of
racketeering, kidnapping and conspiracy in Camarena's death. He was
not charged with the actual murder.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican policeman, was found
guilty of kidnapping but innocent of murder. Drug baron Juan Ramon
Matta Ballesteros was convicted of kidnapping, but the jury also
refused to convict him of murder.
   In the first U.S. trial stemming from the Camarena slaying, two
defendants were convicted in 1988 of murder, and a third was found
guilty of aiding the escape of a Mexican drug lord after the
slayings.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country. More
than 20 have been imprisoned in Mexico. Fourteen others are at
large in Mexico, including the former head of Mexico's Interpol.
   Still pending is the case of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who
was spirited out of Mexico at the behest of the DEA and brought to
Los Angeles to face charges in the Camarena case.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 10 years of fast-forward growth, video
retailers facing industrywide slo-mo are adding pizzazz, and in at
least one case pizzas, to get movie rentals back on track.
   Film-savvy clerks, easier-to-find titles, candy counters, video
reference databases and free telephones for renters who need to
consult with those at home regarding second choices are among the
perks being offered to keep the customer satisfied, participants at
an industry convention say.
   ``Going to the video store is no longer fun,'' said Robert
Klingensmith, president of Paramount Picture's video division.
   In a glum keynote address at the ninth annual Video Software
Dealers Association convention, Klingensmith told retailers what
they already knew _ that sales growth has leveled off after a boom
decade.
   ``We have new customers who are hard to reach and old customers
whose interests may be waning or need to be reinforced,'' he said.
   To counter the trend, renting videos must become less of an
ordeal, Klingensmith said.
   That's the goal at the Video Station in Alameda, Calif., where
video shoppers can take home fresh, ready-to-bake pizzas. Customers
unable to decide on a second choice after failing to find what
they're after at New Hampshire's Empire Video can call home for
free.
   Simple improvements like better shelf organization can help,
said Mitch Lowe, chairman of the convention.
   ``The thing that I hate the most is where films are just thrown
anywhere,'' Lowe said. ``You can't just expect people to find the
title they want by putting it on the wall.''
   Other simple measures are hiring more knowledgeable clerks,
stocking a wider variety of candy and installing after-hours drop
slots and rental machines.
   About 15,000 delegates are attending the convention, in its
third day today.
   Ken Dorrance, who owns Video Station with his wife, said his
pizzas are part of a larger plan to give consumers the attention
video chains often cannot.
   He lets patrons reserve movies by phone, sells movie-related
toys and hires clerks with some movie knowledge.
   ``What else can you excel at besides customer service? Everybody
else has the same titles,'' Dorrance said.
   Lowe said it may cost $2 more per hour to employ clerks who know
``Steel Magnolias'' isn't a how-to tape on gardening. ``But if you
pay someone $2 more per hour, they can tell people about films and
rent two or three more movies an hour,'' he said.
   According to the trade publication Video Flash, 4.1 billion
tapes were rented last year and 196 million were sold. Although up
from the previous year, the growth does not parallel the rise in
the number of U.S. households with video cassette recorders, now an
estimated 70 percent.
   Many customers complain they cannot always find what they are
looking for. More than 75 percent of all renters did not find what
they wanted on at least one occasion, and 6 percent left the store
with no tape at all, Video Flash said.
   Video Munch, a supplier of snacks for video stores, is showing
off a new Ninja Turtle gummy candy at its convention booth to
complement a gourmet line that includes spice drops, jelly rings
and natural pistachios.
   ``What we want to do is get a mini candy store in every
outlet,'' said Lenard LaPan, a company sales representative.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is postponing a South American
trip in September, but still plans to spend five days stumping for
Republican candidates around the country.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that
Bush put off a scheduled Sept. 16-22 trip to Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela.
   Bush postponed the trip because of ``the need to be personally
involved in the budget negotiations in September and the prospect
of preparing for a sequestration on Sept. 30,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Bush plans to travel to Kennebunkport, Maine, on
Friday for a 24-day summer vacation.
   Here is the president's full travel schedule:
   Aug. 10: Departs White House for summer home in Kennebunkport.
   Aug. 20: Travels to Baltimore to address Veterans of Foreign War
convention, returns to Maine.
   Sept. 3: Returns to White House from Maine.
   Sept. 6: Travels to Topeka, Kan., for fund-raiser for Gov. Mike
Hayden and to Tallahassee, Fla., for Rep. Bill Grant, R-Fla., and
the Florida GOP.
   Sept. 9: Attends dedication of the restored Ellis Island in New
York harbor.
   Sept. 11-12: Flies to Denver for fund-raiser for Rep. Hank
Brown, a Senate candidate, and the Colorado GOP. Proceeds to Los
Angeles for a fund-raiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, running for
governor, and spends night in Los Angeles. Flies to San Francisco
Sept. 12 for another Wilson fund-raiser.
   Sept. 26-27: Flies to Akron, Ohio, for fund-raiser for former
Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, now running for governor, then to
Chicago for a fund-raiser for Rep. Lynn Martin, a Senate candidate.
Spends the night in Minneapolis.
   He attends a fund-raiser on Sept. 27 in Minneapolis for the GOP
gubernatorial candidate, flies to Cleveland for another fund-raiser
for Voinovich and then Detroit for a fund-raiser for Senate
candidates.
   Sept. 30: Travels to New York City to attend the U.N. Conference
on Children, remains overnight.
   Oct. 1: Addresses U.N. General Assembly.

<HEAD>American Returning Home From Captivity in Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American tourist who spent four days in a
military jail in his native Yugoslavia is headed home after paying
a $4,500 fine for deserting the Yugoslav army 30 years ago.
   Zjelko Skalicki, a Cleveland industrialist and naturalized U.S.
citizen, also was given a suspended four-month prison sentence by a
Yugoslav military tribunal, said Pero Novak of Cleveland, who
lobbied Congress for Skalicki's release.
   Skalicki, 53, was making his first visit to his homeland with
his wife and three children when he was arrested last week in a
hotel in Porta Rose, Slovenia.
   Skalicki, who became a U.S. citizen 22 years ago, was a young
man nearing the end of a mandatory two-year tour of duty in the
Yugoslav military when he fled the country.
   Novak said he did not know whether the Yugoslav military
returned the $7,000 bond that Skalicki posted for his release from
jail on Friday.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Narrows Losses, Dollar Stable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange made up
huge morning losses Tuesday afternoon, while the dollar remained
stable against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 1,327 points at
the end of morning trading, narrowed its losses to 946.46 points,
or 3.31 percent, ending the day at 27,653.07.
   The index has lost 3,184.92 points since Thursday, when Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   The dollar closed at 150.60 yen. It had opened 1.25 yen from
Monday's close of 149.50 yen. The currency moved between 150.48 yen
and 151.10 yen during the afternoon session.
   Traders said the Nikkei recovered late afternoon as investors
finally started picking up underpriced issues that have declined in
the last few days.
   Until mid-morning, almost half of the 225 issues on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange were left without prices
because no one was interested in buying them, traders said. They
said the index could fall further in the afternoon when
participants gradually filed sell orders.
   ``Investors are panicking because their fears are growing as
they now realize how serious the situation could be,'' said a
trader with Nomura Securities Co. who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had lost 1,327 points, or
4.64 percent, to end the morning session at 27,271.86. The index
lost 729.42 points on Friday, and 916.23 points on Monday.
   The Nomura trader said soaring oil prices had fueled investors'
fears of inflation and accelerated panic-selling. In New York, the
oil price surpassed $28 per barrel on Monday. Oil prices continued
to rise in early Asian trading, as October Brent sold at $27.05 per
barrel Tuesday morning.
   ``There were almost no buyers for 40,000 issues offered for sale
in initial trading,'' said Yoshihide Koyama, an analyst with Nikko
Securities.
   Koyama said buyers were staying out of the market because of
uncertainty over the Middle East, rising oil prices and Monday's
93.31-point drop in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In currency markets, dealers said the yen was recovering its
stability following dollar sales as investors took profits despite
the dollar's strong overnight increase in New York.
   ``Uncertainty about the Middle East is a factor that encourages
dollar-buying, but on the other hand, pessimistic prospects over
the U.S. economy, which is a dollar-selling factor, is equally
strong,'' said Takashi Fujii, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Right now, investors are watching both factors _ the Middle
East situation and the U.S. economy, and the currency could move in
either direction, '' he said.
   As part of an international effort to isolate Iraq, Japan is
freezing both Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in Japan and suspending
credit in cooperation with international sanctions voted by the
U.N. Security Council, said Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
   Hashimoto said the yen will strengthen in aftermath of
Iran-Kuwait crisis.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds soared to 8.135 percent from Monday's
close of 7.935 percent. Their price slipped to 82.85 points from
83.71.

   Iraqi media attacks on the ousted royal
family of Kuwait indicate concern in Baghdad that the family is
still recognized at home and abroad as tahe legitimate rulers of
Kuwait.
   ``The corrupt al-Sabah family are not Arabs,'' Iraq's ruling
Baath Party newspaper Al-Thawra declared on Monday.
   Another Iraqi newspaper said the Kuwaiti royal family was
descended from Christian crusaders who were defeated by Arabs in
the 11th century.
   After their defeat, ``they wandered in the desert where they
practiced primitive medicine among the Arab tribes,'' Al-Qadissiya
newspaper said.
   Iraq's state-controlled newspapers said the al-Sabah family had
been removed from Kuwait forever.
   After its invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, Iraq replaced the
royal family with the ``provisional government of free Kuwait,'' a
leadership of nine previously unknown officers.
   However, Arab nations and the rest of the world still recognize
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in exile in Saudi Arabia, as
Kuwait's legitimate ruler.
   The al-Sabah family began its rule in 1756 after arriving in the
Persian Gulf region from central Arabia. The family's rule had been
uninterrupted until Iraq's invasion, although Kuwait was a British
protectorate from 1899 to 1961.
   After its attack, Iraq was unable to find any prominent Kuwaiti
to serve in the revolutionary government it installed. Most experts
believe the family is admired for its shrewd investment of Kuwait's
huge oil income.
   Investment funds set up to provide income for the state after
the country's oil runs out are estimated at more than $100 billion.
Last year, the funds earned Kuwait more income than it received
from oil exports.
   Kuwait's per capita income is $20,000 a year.
   The number of al-Sabah princes has grown to more than 1,000. But
the rulership is given to members of two branches descended from
the Emir Mubarak the Great who ruled at the turn of the century.
   Princes serve as head of state, prime minister, fill key
ministries and other critical jobs such as head of Kuwait's office
in London which oversees the massive foeign investments.
   Power of attorney over Kuwait's public wealth is held by the
ruler, making the emirate virtually a family business like Saudi
Arabia. But the Kuwaiti princes have generally led more austere
lives than their Saudi counterparts.
   ``They take a share but they don't rub it in,'' said a Kuwaiti
newspaper editor before the invasion.
   There have been pressures for more democracy in the emirate,
with calls for a Western-style Parliament. Kuwait experimented with
a Parliament twice in the 1970s and 1980s with a fully-elected,
50-seat body.
   Both times the Parliament was closed by the emir after members
engaged in harsh criticism of government ministers' performance.
   Elections were held in June for a third try at a Parliament,
with one-third of the members appointed by the ruler.
   Only male Kuwaiti citizens over 21 were eligible to vote.
Turnout was 63 percent and most government-sponsored candidates won
handily.
   A group of 30 former liberal parliamentarians organized a
boycott of the elections, saying the parliament should be fully
elected.
   With the exception of a handful of radicals, however, most
opposition members were thought to favor more power-sharing by the
al-Sabah family but not its overthrow.
   Some in the Arab world welcomed the Iraqi invasion. Some
Palestinians, for example, believed Kuwait had not done enough to
support their cause against Israel.
   In Jordan, where more than 50 percent of the population is of
Palestinian origin, the media said the Iraqi invasion was justified.
   A Jordanian journalist said resentment was based on three
factors: Kuwait's failure to give enough support to Jordan as a
front-line state facing Israel; not investing in Jordan to boost
its economy; and treatment of the large Palestinian minority in
Kuwait as second-class citizens.
   More than 300,000 Palestinians are among the 1.2 million
expatriates in Kuwait. There are only 600,000 Kuwaiti citizens.
   Few expatriates had dared speak out against the Kuwaiti monarchy
for fear of deportation. They faced losing much higher income and
better living conditions in Kuwait than they would find at home in
India, Pakistan, Iran or Egypt.
   The Al Ahrar newspaper of Cairo, expressing the opinion of
poorer Arabs, referred to the invasion as a ``problem of rich and
poor. While some countries like Somalia and Sudan starve, other
have billions.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization was among seven members of
the Arab League that refused to condemn Iraq for the invasion. PLO
leader Yasser Arafat was believed unwilling to offend Iraq, a more
likely hero for the Palestinians in their battle to gain a homeland
from Israel.

<HEAD>`Ghost' Reappears in First Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ghost,'' the Patrick Swayze thriller, has
proved a strong presence at the box office, landing in first place
for the third time.
   Not even ``Dick Tracy'' or ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' has been
No. 1 for more than two weeks during a summer that has failed to
produce a blockbuster.
   ``No one would have picked `Ghost' as a top summer picture,''
said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But there it is.''
   ``Ghost,'' about the return of a murdered man's spirit to
protect his lover and solve his own slaying, also stars Demi Moore
and Whoopi Goldberg. It took in $10.2 million at the box office
last weekend.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' the Harrison Ford courtroom drama about a
prosecutor charged with murdering a former lover, earned $10.1
million and traded places with ``Ghost'' after bumping it from
first place the week before.
   In third with $8 million was the debut of ``Young Guns II,'' a
sequel starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estevez, Kiefer
Sutherland and Christian Slater. It is a retelling of the fight
between Billy the Kid and lawman Pat Garrett.
   ``Problem Child,'' despite universally bad reviews, remained in
the top five for its second week, delivering $6.8 million in ticket
sales.
   In fifth place was creepy-crawly ``Arachnophobia,'' capturing
$5.9 million.
   ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' sixth with $4.8 million.
   Director Spike Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues'' opened in limited
release and sold $4.3 million in tickets for seventh place. The
movie stars Denzel Washington as a jazz trumpeter playing notes
when not pursuing two women.
   Gone from the top 10 were two of the most touted movies of the
summer, ``Days of Thunder'' and ``Dick Tracy,'' which earned
slightly over $1 million, enough to put it in the six-digit
category with $101 million in earnings over eight weeks.
   ``Days'' earned $2.6 million, and with a total of $73.7 million,
seems hard-pressed to pass the $100 million mark.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $10.7 million, 1,766 screens, $6,115
per screen, $69.1 million, four weeks.
   2. ``Presumed Innocent,'' Warner Bros. $10.1 million, 1,380
screens, $7,374 per screen, $28.3 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Young Guns II,'' 20th Century Fox, $8 million, 1,770
screens, $4,530 per screen, $11.8 million, one week
   4. ``Problem Child,'' Universal, $6.8 million, 1,768 screens,
$3,870 per screen, $22.1 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Arachnophobia,'' Disney, $5.9 million, 2,005 screens,
$2,975 per screen, $34.1 million, three weeks.
   6. ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder,'' 20th Century Fox, $4.8 million,
1,946 screens, $2,475 per screen, $95.6 million, five weeks.
   7. ``Mo' Better Blues,'' Universal, $4.3 million, 544 screens,
$8,065 per screen, $4.3 million, one week.
   8. ``Ducktales,'' Disney, $3.8 million, 1,549 screens, $2,499
per screen, $3.8 million, one week.
   9. ``The Freshman,'' Tri-Star, $3.4 million, 1,044 screens,
$3,295 per screen, $10.1 million, three weeks.
   10. ``The Jungle Book,'' Disney, $2.7 million, 1,478 screens,
$1,868 per screen, $31.7 million, four weeks.

<HEAD>China to Double Number of Panda Reserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China plans to open up 14 panda reserves, more
than doubling the number of protected zones for the endangered
animal and forcing some people to relocate, an official newspaper
said today.
   Foreigners who have visited some of the 13 existing panda
reserves in China have found the areas heavily inhabited by people,
pushing the pandas to small mountaintop areas and preventing them
from mingling during mating season.
   More than 4,000 peasants live in China's showcase panda research
and breeding center in Wolong, in southwest China's Sichuan
province.
   The China Daily report today said residents now living in the
proposed conservation areas would be persuaded to move and
extensive publicity and education would be used to ``arouse the
public's consciousness on protection of pandas.''
   The World Wildlife Fund, which uses the panda on its logo, is to
provide money, equipment and facilities, the paper said, without
providing a figure. The organization will send experts to train
Chinese staff and carry out laboratory work, the report said.
   In Britain last week, senior World Wildlife Fund officials said
pandas do not have much chance of survival if the Chinese
government does not provide funds for the ``panda management plan''
the organization helped the Chinese formulate.
   The China Daily report did not say whether the new reserves were
part of the plan. It did say that the World Wildlife Fund
participated in studies on the proposed reserves, and that final
approval was needed from both the wildlife fund and the State
Council, China's Cabinet.
   Western experts estimate that China has 1,100-1,500 pandas
living in the wild. Poaching is the main cause of China's dwindling
panda population, though the government has instituted harsh
penalties for panda killing including the death penalty. Panda
skins can fetch tens of thousands of dollars.
   The paper said the Chinese government each year allocates
$850,000 to rescue and protect the species.
   Today's report said the new reserves would be set up in the
provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi, in southwest and central
China, and would take 10 years to establish.
   The report did not say how much area the reserves would cover or
how many pandas are in the areas to be protected.

<HEAD>Experts Differ On Possible Oil Shortages</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As nations look to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere to
make up loss of oil from Kuwait and Iraq, predictions from experts
on world supplies range from no immediate danger of shortages to
severe restrictions soon.
   Uncertainty has sent prices surging. In New York, West Texas
intermediate crude was $28.05 a barrel at Monday's close, a
five-year high and $3.65 up on Friday's close. In Tokyo today,
North Sea Brent Blend was trading at $27.75, up $1.40 from its
close Monday.
   The United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 on Monday to
impose broad sanctions against Iraq, punishment for its invasion of
Kuwait. The penalties include a ban on imports and exports aimed at
blocking Baghdad's oil trade.
   ``There will be a potential restriction of oil supply in the
near future that could range in intensity from significant to
highly severe,'' the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly
newsletter published in Cyprus, said Monday.
   But in London, experts said disruption of oil supplies from Iraq
and Kuwait posed no immediate danger of shortages. They said,
however, that extra world capacity could be called upon quickly,
pushing prices higher.
   Iraq produced 3.1 million barrels of oil daily in July and
Kuwait 1.6 million. Together, that accounted for 9 percent of world
output, the International Energy Agency reported. Excluding Iraq
and Kuwait, the Persian Gulf has unused capacity of 3.2 million
barrels a day, the agency said.
   The extra capability is concentrated in Saudi Arabia, but
analysts say there are doubts the Saudis would be willing to
antagonize Iraq by stepping up output.
   ``The key obviously lies with Saudi Arabia; and there must be
considerable doubt as to how far the Kingdom would be prepared to
go in antagonizing Iraq,'' the newsletter said.
   But Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst at the London investment
company Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said: ``In the short term, I
don't think people are panicking too much. The world could last six
months or so almost quite happily.''
   She said Norway, which doesn't belong to OPEC, might be able to
kick in an extra 200,000 barrels a day.
   Britain's North Sea supplies, amounting to 3.6 million barrels a
day in July, have been constrained by summer maintenance and
industrial action by workers.
   And oil producer Venezuela said Monday it would not immediately
increase its oil prices or production.
   The reaction in Mexico, the world's fifth-biggest exporter of
crude oil, was the same:
   ``We're watching prices very closely, but we have not changed
our policy,'' said a source at the state petroleum monopoly Pemex.
   Mexico has been exporting an average of 1.2 million barrels of
oil a day and experts said the oil wells are pumping at full
capacity.
   Worldwide, the oil market has had an excess of supply and oil
importers' stocks are high, experts say. The oil shocks of the
1970s also have made industrial nations accomplished in cutting
demand.
   Before the U.N. vote, the United States, the 12-nation European
Economic Community, Japan and other countries had announced plans
to impose an embargo on Iraqi oil purchases.
   Iraq, which pipes most of its oil through Saudi Arabia to the
Red Sea and Turkey to the Mediterranean, on Monday cut back the oil
flow through its Turkish pipeline following reports the United
States had asked Turkey to block the lines. President Turgut Ozal
of Turkey said before the U.N. Security Council imposed its embargo
that he would abide by it.
   Kuwaiti production was halted after Iraq's invasion.
   The Dutch government said Monday it was stopping Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil shipments to Rotterdam, one of the world's largest oil
harbors.
   France said Monday ships carrying Iraqi oil or under Iraqi
control would be refused permission to dock at French ports.
   And Australia, Brazil and Switzerland on Monday all announced
embargoes on Iraqi oil imports.
   Brazil buys about 30 percent _ 160,000 barrels a day _ of its
oil from Iraq.
   ``We are in a comfortable position because we produce over half
the oil we use and already have 70 days worth of stocks,'' said
Lanning Elwis, a spokesman for Brazil's state oil monopoly
Petrobras.

<HEAD>U.S. Senator Denies Influencing Bank Regulators in CenTrust
Seizure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham says he never tried to delay
the government seizure of CenTrust Bank, whose failure led to a
record $1.7 billion bailout.
   NBC reported Monday that Graham special counsel Steve Josias
arranged a 1987 meeting between banking regulators and CenTrust
lawyers and used his position at the senator's office to bring
pressure on regulators looking into the thrift.
   Graham, a Democrat and member of the Senate's powerful Banking
Committee, said he first learned in March about the meeting. The
senator said it was ``bad judgment'' for his aide _ who had done
legal work for the thrift _ to attend.
   But he said, ``I would say categorically (my office) did not
have any effect on any action by federal regulators that would have
affected their decisions.''
   Josias, who served as special counsel to Graham for six months
and whose law firm had handled some real estate matters for
CenTrust, called the NBC allegations ``ludicrous.''
   He said he merely convened the meeting with regulators from the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board at the request of CenTrust officials
who felt government officials were failing to respond to questions
on regulatory procedures.
   But Josias admitted he should have told all concerned about his
firm's work for CenTrust.
   When regulators seized CenTrust in February, they blamed its
failure on speculative investing, including the purchase of more
than $1 billion in junk bonds.
   They also cited the lavish spending of the institution's
chairman, David L. Paul, who allegedly spent millions of thrift
dollars on a museum-quality art collection for his home, a company
yacht, limousines and a corporate jet.
   Paul has declined comment about CenTrust and its seizure, which
has led to the biggest bailout to date of the savings and loan
crisis.
   Investigators are examining the legality of $328,000 in
political contributions by Paul. Graham said he never received
money from Paul or any CenTrust political action committees.
   Previously, five other senators have come under scrutiny by the
Senate Ethics Committee for meeting with regulators about Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., after accepting a
combined $1.3 million in political contributions from the failed
thrift's owner, Charles Keating Jr.
   The senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald Riegle,
D-Mich.

   Block parties, a candlelight march and a
U.S.-Canadian motorcade top the plans for tonight's seventh annual
National Night Out, in which citizens step outside to reclaim the
streets from criminals.
   Organizers are hoping that millions of ordinary people across
the country will turn on porch lights and emerge from behind locked
doors to meet local police and let street predators know they're
watching.
   The neighborhood activism began in 1984 with an idea advanced by
Matt Peskin and the National Association of Town Watch.
   ``It's a July 4 atmosphere, but there's seriousness,'' Peskin
said. ``We call it a party with a purpose.''
   This year it's going international, with a noontime ``hands
across the border'' ceremony scheduled at Mather Arch in Fort Erie,
Ontario. Slated to take part were 300 members of police agencies
and neighborhood groups from western New York and southern Ontario.
   The ceremonies in Canada were to be followed by a motorcade
across the Peace Bridge to the New York State Armory in Buffalo,
led by Canadian Pipes and Drums and Royal Mounted Police.
   ``This will demonstrate that crime doesn't stop at the
international boundary and policing is a universal job,'' said
Peskin.
   Cities around the country are sponsoring block parties.
Milwaukee planned 1,000 parties and demonstrations to show people
how to illuminate their homes. Police in Plainsboro, N.J., will
give away two cases of floodlights.
   Syracuse, N.Y., planned a city-county candlelight march. In
Louisville, Ky., sirens and church bells will sound at 8 p.m., a
signal for people to turn on their outside lights and check the
batteries in their home smoke detectors.
   ``It's a rare chance, especially for the kids. The event seems
to draw out neighborhoods that have usually been tough to involve
in anything,'' Peskin said.
   ``Generally, most people are law-abiding and they want to be
neighborly. But nowadays, if you try to be neighborly, many people

   Former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon
Jr., impeached by Congress for a perjury conviction, is back behind
bars on charges he carried a gun during an illegal turkey shoot, a
violation of his parole.
   Nixon, 61, was arrested Monday at his Ocean Springs home after
the U.S. Justice Department learned of his state conviction on
misdemeanor hunting offenses.
   Nixon was convicted July 6 of hunting over a field illegally
spread with corn to lure wild turkeys. He was fined $100. Testimony
revealed he carried two guns in cases. Felons on parole are barred
from carrying firearms.
   The U.S. Parole Commission could order Nixon to serve the three
years of prison time remaining from his perjury conviction, or he
could receive as little as a reprimand. He was being held at the
Copiah County Jail.
   Al Binder, Nixon's attorney, said the former judge ``is very
concerned and I'm sure he's upset.''
   ``I'm hopeful when they hear the whole story that they'll give
him some consideration and not revoke his parole,'' Binder said.
   Nixon was convicted in 1986 of perjury for lying to federal
grand jury about discussions he had with a prosecutor about a drug
case. The Senate stripped Nixon of his judgeship and $89,500 annual
salary last November.
   He was paroled the same month after serving two years of a
five-year sentence.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge Again, Dollar Strengthens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply today to its
lowest level in nearly 22 months as uncertainties over the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait grew. The dollar strengthened against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 150.60 yen, up 1.10 yen from Monday's
149.50 finish. The currency opened at 150.75 yen and ranged between
150.48 and 151.10.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 946.46 points, or 3.31
percent, ending the day at 27,653.07, the lowest level since Oct.
26, 1988, when the index fell to 27,620.60.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, the index has lost
3,184.92 points, or 11.5 percent. First section volume today was
thin, estimated at 500 million shares, up from Monday's 330 million.
   On an active day, more than 1 billion shares are traded.
   The index ended the morning session with a 1,327-point decline
before bargain-hunting helped regain some of the loss in the
afternoon, according to traders who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the Nikkei's decline was caused by growing fears among
investors of Middle East developments, surging oil prices, plunging
government bond prices and the weakening yen.
   Oil prices continued moving up in Asia, with October Brent
valued at $27.80 to $28.00 a barrel at around 3 p.m.
   It sold at $27.05 at the beginning of the day.
   Meanwhile, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds closed at 82.98 points, down from Monday's
83.71-point finish. The yield finished at 8.105 percent, up from
7.935 percent.
   ``Market players were increasingly getting pessimistic, and they
were almost panicking,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New
Japan Securities Co.
   There were plenty of sellers today but buyers stayed out of the
market, analysts said.
   ``Unless they figure out the extent of its effect, investors are
inclined to stay away from the stock market,'' Nomura said.
   The Japanese government has imposed a set of sanctions against
Iraq for invading Kuwait, including a ban on oil imports from Iraq
and Kuwait and on all Japanese exports to the two nations.
   Japan relies on imports for 99 percent of its oil needs and has
never previously banned the import of petroleum.
   While top officials acknowledge the sanctions will affect daily
life, they point out that the nation's petroleum reserves, which
are estimated to last for 142 days, should cushion the impact.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will ask other oil-producing Arab
countries later this month to expand their crude oil production if
the embargo is prolonged.
   In currency dealings, soaring oil prices and further declines in
stock and bond markets added to the currency market's bearish
sentiment toward the yen, although there was a slight recovery of
stability, dealers said.
   They said some market players sold the U.S. currency to take
profits from its strong overnight increase in New York.
   ``Uncertainty about the Middle East is a factor that encourages
dollar buying, but on the other hand, pessimistic prospects over
the U.S. economy, which is a dollar-selling factor, is equally
strong,'' said Takashi Fujii, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Right now, investors are watching both factors _ the Middle
East situation and the U.S. economy _ and the currency could move
in either direction, '' he said.
   Finance Minister Hashimoto said earlier today that the yen will
strengthen in the aftermath of the Middle East crisis.

<TEXT>
   World leaders in Colombia for today's
inauguration of president-elect Cesar Gaviria have pledged to aid
the violence-weary country in its fight against drug trafficking
and terrorism.
   Security in the capital was heavy, with some 5,000 soldiers and
policemen guarding against possible attacks by drug-bankrolled
terrorists. Army officials declared a maximum security alert in the
hours leading up to the inauguration.
   Military helicopters circled Bogota, and the army set up 40mm
anti-aircraft guns on a hill half a mile from the presidential
palace, where Gaviria was to take the oath of office for a
four-year term.
   Roadblocks and army checkpoints lined major roads and highways.
   Gaviria, 43, has promised to hold to the current tough line
against cocaine barons, who have waged a nearly year-old war
against the government in an attempt to force and end to the
extradition of drug traffickers.
   About 500 people have died in a wave of bombings and
assassinations.
   On Monday, the presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador and
Haiti, along with high-level delegations from scores of other
countries, arrived in Bogota for the inaugural ceremonies. Vice
President Dan Quayle was expected today.
   ``Drug trafficking is a blow to the international community, and
it must be fought through international cooperation,'' said
Ecuador's President Rodrigo Borja.
   Giovanni Spadolini, president of Italy's senate, echoed Borja's
sentiments: ``We are particularly sensitive to this fight against
the drug scourge, and we offer our solidarity.''
   But in his inaugural speech, Gaviria was expected to ask foreign
nations to provide economic aid and special trade status rather
than military assistance, said the RCN radio network.
   Colombian drug cartels supply about 80 percent of cocaine
purchased in the United States. Cocaine is a multibillion dollar
business in Colombia and the revenues and jobs it provides have
helped prop up the economy.
   A year ago, the United States sent Colombia $65 million in
military aid including helicopters and bullet-proof vests. But the
economic aid Colombia had hoped for, such as preferential treatment
for its exports, never materialized.
   RCN said Gaviria would also ask industrialized countries to
control money laundering by drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Palestinian Women Killed In Apparent Revenge For Slayings of Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian woman was shot to death as she
drove past a Jewish West Bank settlement early today, and officials
suspected she was killed by settlers in revenge for the slayings of
two Israeli teen-agers.
   In Jerusalem, police poured hundreds of additional forces into
the city following mass anti-Arab riots that were sparked by the
discovery of the youths' bodies on Monday.
   Thousands took to the streets in at least seven neighborhoods
and officials said the extent of the rioting was unprecedented in
this mixed Jewish-Arab city. The violence persisted this morning as
Arabs heading to work in Jerusalem came under attack on the highway
linking the city to the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem.
   An angry Israeli mob forced a Palestinian-owned car to stop on
that road and then smashed its windshield with iron bars, injuring
seven passengers, Arab reports said.
   Soldiers at nearby roadblocks later urged Palestinians not to
enter Jerusalem, warning they could get stoned and most returned
home.
   Thousands of Israelis were expected to attend the funeral of the
two youths later today _ and police feared trouble.
   The slain Palestinian woman was identified by Arab reports as
Aziza Salem Jaber, 27, from the West Bank town of Hebron.
   Mrs. Jaber was shot twice in the head as the station wagon she
rode past the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba at about 2 a.m.,
police officials said, refusing to elaborate.
   An official source confirmed police suspected the shooting was
by a settler in revenge for the brutal slayings of the two Jewish
teen-agers, 18-year-old Ronen Karamani and 17-year-old Lior Tubul.
   Arab witnesses said a group of settlers were standing near the
Kiryat Arba entrance when the shots were fired. The reports said
Mrs. Jaber's cousin, Najeh, was wounded in the shoulder.
   Mrs. Jaber and other relatives were reportedly accompanying a
pregnant cousin to a hospital at the time of the shooting.
   Her death would bring to 726 the number of Palestinians slain by
Israelis since the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising.
Another 245 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
   The slayings of Tubul and Karamni brought the Israeli death toll
in the uprising to 47.
   Teen-age volunteers found their bodies Monday with multiple stab
wounds in a dry river bed near the Jewish neighborhood of Ramot in
Arab east Jerusalem, just inside the city limits.
   The army swiftly clamped a curfew on a nearby village and
conducted wide searches but no arrests were made.
   News of the slayings sparked the worst anti-Arab riots in
Jerusalem. ``The scope was unprecedented,'' Amir Heshin, advisor to
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek on Arab Affairs, said on army radio.
   Several thousand angry Israelis blocked main highways throughout
the city, showering Arab-owned cars with rocks and cinderblocks.
Some 20 to 30 Arabs were injured by police estimate.
   The depth of anti-Arab feelings stirred by the stabbings was
also reflected in Israel's mass-circulation news dailies Tuesday.
   The three most widely read newspapers splashed across their
front pages a picture of Karamani's corpse. The photo showed the
youth lying face down in a rocky field, a towel tied around his
mouth and his blue T-shirt ripped by stab wounds.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily linked the slayings to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. ``The war of Arabs against Arabs, just like the
war of Arabs against us are a different face to a process of
reducing the limits of human morality,'' Yediot editorialized.
   The conservative Maariv daily called on security officials to
restrict the free movement of Palestinians in Israeli-controlled
territories.
   ``Perhaps it would harm our liberalism to a certain extent, but
the harm done by the murderers is much more serious and in order to
thwart them it is permissible to compromise on the open gates
policy,'' Maariv wrote.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug for Lung Disease of Premature Infants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors have a new drug effective against a lung
disease that kills about 3,000 premature infants a year.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Monday it approved
Exosurf, which cuts the death rate in half in premature infants
suffering from respiratory distress syndrome, the most common cause
of death in babies under 30 days old.
   The drug is a mixture of synthetic chemicals that mimics the
action of lung surfactant, a liquid in the lungs that helps keep
them inflated. Premature infants cannot make surfactant, and their
lungs can collapse if not treated.
   The drug was invented by Dr. John Clements of the University of
California at San Francisco and is made by Burroughs Wellcome Co.
of Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   Approval of the drug ``is a very important development,'' said
Dr. Mary Ellen Avery, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical
School in Boston. ``There has been a significant reduction in
deaths among those who were treated.''
   Respiratory distress syndrome afflicts 50,000 infants each year
and kills about 3,000 of them, the American Lung Association said.
   Exosurf and another experimental surfactant made from cows'
lungs, Survanta, have been available since last year, when the FDA
allowed distribution under a policy to make life-saving drugs
available before approval.
   Survanta, is made by Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill.An
Abbott spokesman said approval of Survanta was expected soon.
   Both drugs have been widely used, and although they have not
been directly compared, ``both work pretty well,'' Avery said.
   Dr. Anthony Corbet, a neonatologist at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston who has participated in studies of Exosurf,
said the drug could significantly lower the U.S. infant mortality
rate.
   The U.S. rate is 10 deaths per 1,000 live births, and about
three infant deaths per 1,000 are due to respiratory distress
syndrome, he said.
   In studies with 1,600 infants with respiratory distress
syndrome, Exosurf cut the death rate 66 percent, the company said.
   When given to 1,800 infants who were at risk of developing the
disease but had not yet contracted it, the drug reduced the death
rate 50 percent, company officials said.
   The company said side effects include a slight increase in
bleeding in the lungs and apnea, a treatable disorder in which
infants intermittently stop breathing.
   Dr. Richard Kent of Burroughs Wellcome explained that without
surfactant, the little air sacs in the lung called alveoli collapse
like balloons if air pressure is not maintained. When surfactant is
added, the alveoli become more like bubble-gum bubbles and maintain
their shape when air pressure falls, he said.

   Julie Gilmore's wedding march was a
success. She didn't trip over the guillotine.
   Ms. Gilmore wed Joseph Berlyak on Monday on the Palace of
Illusions stage at the Ohio State Fair, where they met last year
when Berlyak coaxed her into volunteering for the guillotine act.
   When Ms. Gilmore, 38, emerged intact, the couple ``fell head
over heels'' for each other, said show manager Maureen Reno. The
two lovers from Akron had dinner after their intial meeting under a
guillotine blade.
   Berlyak, 42, emcee of last year's magic show, said he was
careful not to flub his lines during the wedding ceremony amid
other gruesome props such as a bed of nails and an electric chair.
   ``If I stutter and don't say yes, she's going to sit me in the
electric chair and threaten to turn it on,'' he said.
   The bride wore a white dress and the groom a pinstripe suit,
rather than traditional carnival garb.
   ``We didn't want to turn it into a circus,'' Berlyak said.

   The Postal Service extended bare bones

   The foot-long artifact took about a week to arrive, with Ms.
Shannon's home address neatly printed on the bone with a marking
pen and a $2.40 postage meter stamp affixed.
   ``We only have a mail slot, so when my father came home, he
found it sticking halfway out,'' Ms. Shannon said.
   ``Greetings from New Mexico,'' read the message from Colleen
Shannon, a park employee at Bandelier National Monument in New
Mexico.
   Two weeks earlier, Kerrie Shannon had complained her sister
hadn't answered any of her six letters. ``I told her to send me
something, and she did,'' she said.
   Joe Sniadecki, a South Bend postal superintendent, said he's
heard of coconuts mailed from Hawaii, but never bones from New
Mexico.
   ``It doesn't happen every day, but there's nothing wrong with it
as far as regulations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A set of ``Doonesbury'' comics
containing suggestive language and showing a woman wearing nothing
but rope and a bucket is in poor taste, say two newspaper editors
who pulled the strips.
   ``If we had been running it on the op-ed page, we probably would
have thought differently about it,'' said Phil Record, associate
executive editor of the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. ``But we
just did not think this was suitable on a page we try to draw kids
to.''
   The newspaper said Monday it will not publish this week's strips
but has notified readers they can pick up copies at newspaper
offices.
   The Republic in Columbus, Ind., also decided to drop the strips.
The newspaper will run old ``Doonesbury'' comics instead, editor
John Harmon said.
   ``It just didn't meet our guidelines for taste,'' he said. ``If
our photographers came back with something like that, we wouldn't
run it.''
   The Baton Rouge (La.) State-Times and Morning Advocate decided
to run the strip opposite the editorial page rather than on the
comics page.
   ``It contains language and art that I would be very reluctant to
invite children to look at,'' said Jim Hughes, executive editor.
``And children read the comics page.''
   The strip by Garry Trudeau apparently refers to controversy over
National Endowment of the Arts funding. Some politicians have tried
to block government money going to art they consider obscene, and
some artists have lost grants.
   In Monday's strip, the character J.J. tells her husband she has
a new concept for performance art so innovative that the NEA will
have to reconsider her grant application.
   She is covered only by a strategically placed rope and her hand,
and she has a bucket over her head.
   In strips for later in the week, J.J. utters words such as
``ooze,'' ``lubricate'' and ``hot juices,'' although she makes no
direct reference to sex acts.
   Lee Salem, editorial director at the strip's distributor,
Universal Press Syndicate, said only about eight to 10 newspapers
called with concerns. The Kansas City company distributes the strip
to about 1,000 newspapers.

<TEXT>
   The system for cleaning up oil spills has
deteriorated over the last decade, a Coast Guard panel said in
winding up an investigation of 12 spills in the New York area this
year.
   The nine-member board led by Rear Adm. William G. Henn said
Monday the system worsened as public and government concern waned
until recently.
   ``We would not have been talking about this 10 years ago and we
had pretty much the same number of spills,'' Henn said. ``What we
thought was good in 1980 is not good enough today.''
   There were 12 oil spills in the area around the Port of New York
and New Jersey during the first seven months of 1990, including a
570,000-gallon spill from an Exxon refinery in Linden, N.J., into
the Arthur Kill on Jan. 2.
   The Coast Guard panel recommended a 10 percent increase in the
number of inspectors in the area. About 75 inspectors monitor ship
and shore facilities.
   The report also recommended a system of radar screens for
monitoring ships in the harbor. Such a tracking system was shut
down in 1988 because of budget constraints. It would cost about $10
million to get it fully operational again.

   Dorothy Silber knew the phantom had struck
when she discovered a row of marigolds underneath a window at her
office.
   The next day there were more, and soon after that, there were
geraniums.
   Her phantom gardener even watered them.
   ``It's everybody's dream come true to have a garden and not have
to plant it,'' said Silber, who said the phantom enriched her
property with more than 400 plants.
   The mystery was solved when she caught the generous green-thumb
at work early one morning. He told her he lives in the neighborhood
and grows all his plants from seed. All he wants is to see them
flourish in attractive settings.
   Tracked down by the The Telegraph of Nashua, the phantom said he
just plants ``what I want, where I want to do it.''
   He spoke freely about his work in this city about 30 miles north
of Boston, but worried any publicity might make him too busy.
   ``I don't want my name in the paper,'' he said. ``Everybody will
be calling me.''

<HEAD>Western Europe Acts In Unison, But France Faulted For Arms Sales</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with sanctions imposed by
Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark; Picks up 9th pvs, `In

<TEXT>
   Western Europe has acted almost in unison in
opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, to the extent that even neutral
Switzerland announced today it will join in imposing sanctions.
   However, the French government is encountering harsh criticism
at home from some political figures who say it bears partial
responsibility for the attack by encouraging massive arms sales to
Iraq over the past decade.
   A former national intelligence director, Pierre Marion, said in
an interview published Monday that France provided Iraq with
one-fourth of its military arsenal while pursuing a ``shortsighted,
incoherent'' Middle East policy. The sales earned an estimated $5
billion for France, which trailed only the Soviet Union as Iraq's
biggest arms supplier.
   France's neighbors haven't echoed such criticisms, and the
French delegation played a leading role at the weekend meeting in
Rome of the European Community, which voted for an embargo on
imports of Iraqi oil.
   The community's 12 member countries also voted to freeze Iraqi
and Kuwaiti assets.
   Switzerland, not a member of the European Community, NATO or any
other political alliance, demonstrated the broad consensus on the
Iraq-Kuwait conflict today, announcing it would break from its
traditional policy of not taking part in international embargoes.
   Switzerland said it would follow the lead of the U.N. Security
Council and ban all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. It
also prohibited all payments and other financial transfers to Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Switzerland had refused to join the U.N.-endorsed sanctions
campaigns against Rhodesia and South Africa.
   Sweden, Norway and Denmark also announced today they were
imposing a complete trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait.
   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Monday the
crisis in the Persian Gulf had produced a rare degree of unity,
transcending customary alliances. In contrast to some recent
foreign policy issues, his government has not found itself at odds
with any major allies.
   The Iraqis ``have got themselves into a corner,'' Hurd told
BBC-TV. ``They did not expect the international community _ the
Russians, Japanese, Europe, at our instance, the Americans _ to
come together so clearly and so soon against this act of
aggression.''
   Britain's relations with Iraq had been strained severely since
the March 15 execution by that country of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian
journalist with the British newspaper, The Observer.
   On March 28, British authorities announced the seizure of parts
that could be used in nuclear bomb triggers just before they were
put aboard an Iraq-bound airliner. In April, large pipes were
seized that Britain alleged were parts for an Iraqi ``super gun''
project.
   In France, the government responded quickly to the Iraqi
invasion by announcing a halt to all arms sales to Baghdad and an
end to training of Iraqi fighter pilots. Officials said arms sales
in fact had stopped in May because of problems arising from Iraq's
debt to France of more than $4 billion. But the actions failed to
ward off criticism.
   On Sunday, the head of France's Greens party, Antoine Waechter,
said the government practiced ``blind diplomacy'' during the years
of arms sales to Iraq.
   ``France is partly responsible for what is happening today,,''
Waechter said. ``France sold arms even when it was obvious that
Iraq had this type of dominating, expansionist behavior.''
   Marion, who in 1981-82 headed France's external intelligence
agency, told the Paris newspaper Le Figaro that France had sold
Iraq 210 Mirage warplanes and state-of-the art missiles.
   Sales continued even after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, he
said.
   Since early this year, Marion said, the French military
contractor Thomson CSF has sold $160 million worth of electronics
equipment to Iraq that could be used to develop sophisticated
military radar systems.
   Four French companies have sold equipment that could be used to
increase the range and accuracy of Soviet-made Scud missiles
possessed by Iraq, Marion was quoted as saying.
   ``Because of the complaisant attitude which it had in the past
toward Saddam Hussein... France today must have a bad conscience
and some regrets,'' said an editorial Monday in the Courrier de
l'Ouest, a newspaper in Angers.
   In West Germany, there also has been extensive media criticism
of allegedly illegal shipments by West German companies to Iraq
over the past several years.
   The news magazine Der Spiegel reported Saturday that German
companies have played central roles in helping Iraq with its
military buildup.

   Look up when you pass the Davenports' place
and you just might see Ed and Sandie up a tree, sipping soda pop in
their gazebo tree house.
   Davenport, a 46-year-old farmer, hopes combining his childhood
longing for a hideaway in the tree tops with an adult penchant for
the peace and quiet of a gazebo will lead to some off-season work.
   It's free advertisement atop a giant cottonwood, 18 feet in
circumference, that's middle limbs were torn off in a wind storm.
   ``I couldn't have found a more perfect tree because it is big
enough and it did look strange without those middle limbs,''
Davenport said recently. ``Of course, some people think it looks
strange now.''
   Davenport started his project about a month ago with a stairway
more than 20 feet into the tree.
   Two weeks after he hammered in the first nail, Davenport
completed the yellow, white and gray latticework structure, which
reaches 30 feet high and seats eight people.
   Davenport hopes the project will attract people interested in
contracting with him to build gazebos in the winter when work on
the farm is slow.
   He says he expects most people would want ground-level
structures, but if any of them want to go out on a limb, he's
willing.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Thin, Uncertain Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in thin, uncertain trading
in Europe late this morning.
   Gold prices were up, but off their early highs as an Asian rally
turned to profit-taking, dealers said.
   Traders said they expected the dollar to recover slightly after
having hit bottom on Monday.
   Dealers said, however, that market conditions remained nervous
because of the tense situation in the Middle East.
   ``It's fairly quiet this morning, but quite tense,'' said one
trader at Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in Frankfurt. ``If Saudi
Arabia cuts off Iraq's oil pipeline and Iraq then invades Saudi
Arabia, then I could imagine people would turn to the dollar as a
safe haven.''
   Some traders said they were optimistic about the Middle East
dispute being settled by diplomatic means.
   But Iraq's blunt warning to the United States to stay out of the
Persian Gulf crisis on Monday and other signs of heightened tension
are prompting traders to try to find safe middle ground, the
Frankfurt trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.10 yen to a closing 150.60 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 149.73 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.5766 West German marks, up from 1.5762
   _1.3266 Swiss francs, down from 1.3315
   _5.2875 French francs, up from 5.2863
   _1.7783 Dutch guilders, up from 1.77660
   _1,152.50 Italian lire, down from 1,154.00
   _1.1488 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1490
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.8803, compared with $1.8725 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $386.20 a troy ounce, up
from $382.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $383.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.90, up from $382.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.94 to close at a bid $383.52.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $4.93 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $4.91.

<HEAD>Salmonella Outbreak May Be Linked to Raw Tomatoes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raw tomatoes may be the common link in
a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 100 people in
four Midwest states since July, health officials say.
   In Illinois, 51 salmonella cases have been reported since July
1, mostly in the Chicago area, said Dr. Bernard Turnock, the
state's public health director.
   Minnesota has reported 38 cases, Michigan 10 and Wisconsin three.
   Minnesota officials said Monday the outbreak of salmonella
javiana was definitely linked to tomatoes. Turnock said test
results from Illinois cases ``show an association with tomatoes as
the common source.''
   Investigators believe tomatoes from a single farm or distributor
may have been contaminated with manure used as fertilizer, but the
source hasn't been pinpointed, said Tom Schafer, a spokesman for
the Illinois Department of Public Health.
   Fecal matter is a common source of salmonella bacteria.
   Tomatoes associated with the outbreak came from grocery stores
and were eaten at restaurants.
   ``Most likely in the fields these tomatoes were fertilized with
manure that got on the tomatoes, plants and such,'' Schafer said.
``If not properly washed, they could carry salmonella.''
   Consumers and food-service workers should wash tomatoes
thoroughly and remove the area where the stem is attached, as well
as any bruised or damaged areas. Sliced or cut tomatoes should be
refrigerated until serving.
   Cooked tomatoes and tomato products aren't considered a
potential problem because cooking destroys the salmonella bacteria,
Turnock said.
   Salmonella symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea and stomach
cramps.
   In 1985, Illinois was the center of a massive Midwest salmonella
outbreak in which more than 16,000 cases were confirmed. The
disease was traced to contaminated low-fat milk processed by a
Chicago-area dairy.
   Schafer said the reported cases in the current outbreak may
represent only a fraction of people stricken. Typically in
salmonella outbreaks, only a relatively small portion of those
afflicted are treated and diagnosed by a physician.
   ``A lot of people could have it and think it was stomach
cramps,'' Schafer said.

   Retired Marine Corps Gen. Lemuel Cornick
Shepherd Jr., who led the 6th Marine Division to victory at Okinawa
in World War II and also served as Corps commandant, has died of
bone cancer. He was 94.
   Shepherd died Monday at his home in this San Diego suburb.
   He received more than 60 decorations during his 42-year military
career and twice was awarded the Legion of Merit while on active
duty.
   Shepherd was appointed commandant of the Marine Corps in 1952 by
President Truman. He served in that position until 1955. He was the
first Marine commandant to serve as a member of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   He was born in Norfolk, Va., and attended the Virginia Military
Institute. He graduated a year early, in 1917, so he could
volunteer for the Marines after the United States entered World War
I.
   Less than a month after reporting for duty, Shepherd sailed for
France. He was wounded twice in fighting at Belleau Wood in 1918.
He also saw action in the Meuse Argonne offensive and was wounded a
third time.
   Shepherd received the Navy Cross, the Army Distinguished Service
Cross and the French Croix de Guerre for gallantry at Belleau Wood.
   After the war, he worked as a junior aide to President Harding,
and served in Haiti until the Marines withdrew from the Caribbean
island in 1934.
   Shepherd took command of the 9th Marine Regiment as a colonel in
March 1942, a few months after the United States entered World War
II. He was promoted to brigadier general before commanding the 1st
Marine Brigade in the attack on Guam.
   In 82 days of combat at Okinawa, his 6th Marine Division _ known
as the ``Striking 6th'' _ captured Naha, the largest city occupied
by Marines during World War II. Shepherd also received the
surrender of the Japanese forces in Tsingtao, China, on Oct. 25,
1945.
   When the Korean War broke out, Shepherd was a lieutenant general
in command of all Marines in the Pacific.
   Shepherd retired in January 1956, but two months later was
recalled to active duty. He retired again three years later and
lived in Warrenton, Va., until he moved to La Jolla in 1968.

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
announced today that it is ending its 29-year guerrilla campaign
and suspending all military action, clearing the way for full-scale
talks on ending white minority rule.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela said his organization was making every
effort to notify supporters to immediately end all armed action
against the government.
   The two sides pledged after 16 hours of talks to work together
to counter growing political violence that has claimed hundreds of
lives in recent months.
   ``The way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new
constitution,'' a joint statement by the two sides declared.
   Police said today at least 15 blacks had been killed in
scattered faction fights around the country since Sunday. The dead
included 11 killed in Kagiso outside Johannesburg in a power
struggle between ANC supporters and Inkatha, the conservative Zulu
political movement, police said.
   The independent South African Press Association said Kagiso was
tense but quiet today, with police patrols deployed in force in the
area.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who announced the cease-fire with
Mandela after the talks, hailed the breakthrough, saying, ``We
think what has happened today forms an important turning point.''
The two leaders looked tired but pleased as they announced the
agreement in the early morning hours.
   ``In the interest of moving as speedily as possible towards a
negotiated peaceful political settlement, and in the context of the
agreement reached, the ANC announced it was now suspending all
armed actions with immediate effect,'' said a joint statement
released by the ANC and the government.
   Mandela said the ANC would halt the infiltration of guerrillas
and arms from neighboring countries. ``We hope that we will be able
to communicate with our people and inform them of what we have
decided,'' he said.
   Mandela and the ANC now face a major test of their leadership to
see if blacks, especially militant youths in black townships,
observe the call for a cease-fire. Some critics fear the ANC has
little actual control at the grass roots level and violence will
continue since many young blacks oppose a peaceful settlement.
   Immediate reaction to the ANC announcement was glowing. Anglican
Archbiship Desmond Tutu, a leading anti-apartheid activist, said,
``It's tremendous news ... we want to commend the ANC very warmly
for its actions.''
   But Tutu echoed warnings from ANC leaders that the government
must act to curb the police and ensure the law was administered
fairly. ANC leaders contend the police oppose reform and continue
to persecute opposition groups.
   Tutu said, ``We must warn the South African government very
sharply that if it does not act very firmly indeed to bring the
police under control, then it will wreck the prospects of a
negotiated settlement.''
   Mandela said the decision to end the ANC's guerrilla campaign
was made even before his five-man delegation arrived for the talks
with de Klerk and Cabinet members. The two sides have been trying
since May to remove obstacles to full-scale talks on ending white
rule.
   Although the ANC's guerrilla wing, Spear of the Nation, has made
no major attacks in the past year, ANC officials have acknowledged
that guerrillas continued to infiltrate the country, stockpile
weapons and plan attacks.
   Mandela had resisted declaring a cease-fire, saying the
government had to make concessions. The ANC demanded the government
release hundreds of political prisoners, grant amnesty to about
20,000 exiles, remove laws restricting political activity and end
the state of emergency in Natal province.
   Today's statement indicated the government has gone some
distance toward meeting ANC demands though stopping short of
outright acceptance. Further discussion of the issues will now take
place.
   The joint statement said the government would consider repealing
some security laws and lifting the state of emergency in Natal. The
emergency gives police wide powers to detain people and restrict
political activity.
   Both sides also agreed to draw up plans for the release of
ANC-connected prisoners and for granting amnesty to many of the
exiles who want to return home.
   Asked what the government had conceded, de Klerk said his
administration would try to ensure that the police deal with all
problems in what he called ``an even-handed manner.''
   In a bit of friction at the news conference, Mandela interjected
that the government had so far failed to bring the police under
control.
   ``It's a totally unsatisfactory situation, and until the
government tames the police, we will be dissatisfied,'' Mandela
said.
   The joint statement also said the government would continue to
review security legislation under which scores of ANC activists,
including a member of the National Executive Committee, have been
detained by police during the past few weeks.
   De Klerk had been under pressure to secure major concessions
from the ANC after he legalized black opposition groups and, in
February, freed Mandela after 27 years in jail. White critics of de
Klerk charged the government failed to gain anything by its
concessions.
   The United States and other Western nations had been urging the
ANC to renounce its armed struggle and seek a peaceful settlement.
   During Mandela's last years in prison, the ANC guerrilla wing
waged an urban bombing campaign. From July 1986 through August
1989, the campaign killed 37 people and injured 680.

   Paramilitary police broke into houses in
a Srinagar suburb and opened fire on sleeping residents, killing at
least 12 people and injuring 15, witnesses said today.
   Authorities said several civilians were killed in the city on
Monday night but said they had no details of the events.
   The authorities also reported that troops of the Border Security
Force raided a house outside Srinigar on Monday and captured two
top Moslem militants and their nine comrades.
   The capture of Yasin Malik, the commander of the Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front, and his deputy, Abdul Hamid Sheikh, was the
government's biggest victory since it began a crackdown on the
militants in January.
   Witnesses said policemen Monday broke into homes in the Hawal
locality searching for Moslem separatists who had earlier attacked
a patrol party with grenades and machine-gun fire.
   ``The policemen broke down locked doors and opened blind fire,''
said Bashir Ahmed, a resident. He said three houses were then set
ablaze.
   Other witnesses said the victims included an 8-year-old girl and
a 75-year-old man.
   J.N. Saxena, the top police official in Jammu-Kashmir state,
said he had ordered an inquiry into the incident. He said the
paramilitary policemen would be tried for murder if charges of
unprovoked firing were found to be true.
   Srinagar, a city of 1 million people, is at the center of the
Moslem movement for secession of the Kashmir valley.
   At least 935 people have been killed in the valley since the
Indian government cracked down on the insurrection on Jan. 20.
   The state of Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the
Jammu plains to the south, is the only one of India's 25 provinces
with a Moslem majority.
   At least 65 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem.
Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle left today for
Bogota for the inauguration of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria,
the first stop on a followup to President Bush's drug summit with
the leaders of cocaine-producing nations.
   On his seventh vice presidential trip to Latin America, Quayle
was to confer with the new presidents of Colombia and Peru, and
with President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.
   David Beckwith, Quayle's spokesman, said the three-day mission
demonstrates the administration's commitment to cooperation in the
drug war.
   The Feb. 15 Cartagena drug summit was held behind a tight
military shield at a heavily guarded Colombian naval base. Even so,
there was controversy about Bush's visit to a nation plagued by
drug violence and assassinations.
   Quayle was to attend an outdoor inauguration ceremony in a
Bogota government plaza, so security clearly was a concern.
   ``We're satisfied the vice president will be secure,'' Beckwith
said.
   Bush had no major new aid or support measures to offer the three
South American leaders, although he was renewing U.S. offers of
military equipment and training to combat the cocaine cartel.
   Colombia's Gaviria has pledged to continue the drug war launched
by outgoing President Virgilio Barco. He ran for the office after
drug terrorists assassinated a top candidate to succeed Barco a
year ago.
   In Lima, Peru, tonight and Wednesday, Quayle was to meet with
recently inaugurated President Alberto Fujimori, who faces an
economic crisis that prompted him to say he had ``inherited a
disaster.''
   Fujimori took office as president of Peru on July 28, succeeding
Alan Garcia.
   The United States has offered Peru $36 million in military
equipment and training aid for use in combating drugs, but Garcia
never signed off on it. Fujimori has said he probably will, but he
also said it won't solve the cocaine problem.
   He wants support for economic development to give cocaine
growers another way to make a living. But Quayle is expected to
tell him that without firm Peruvian measures against the drug
trade, economic aid will face trouble in Congress.
   The vice president travels to La Paz, Bolivia, on Wednesday,
where he is expected to call for ratification of an extradition
agreement under which drug-trafficking suspects could face U.S.
trials. Extraditions played a major role in Barco's Colombian drug
war.
   Paz Zamora met with President Bush in Washington on May 8. They
signed a new trade and investment agreement and a $60 million,
three-year food aid program.
   Gaviria saw Bush on July 13, repeating a point all the Andean
leaders stress: cutting the cocaine traffic is going to require
cutting consumption of illegal narcotics in the United States.
   They also want trade and assistance for their troubled
economies. At the drug summit in Cartagena, Bush and the three
South American leaders agreed that substituting legal crops for
coca would have ``significant, immediate and long-term economic
costs'' for the nations involved.
   Bush since has proposed measures he said would begin creating a
Western Hemisphere common market, with free trade in North and
South America. He called for a new inter-American investment fund
and steps to ease the Latin debt burden in exchange for economic,
investment and environmental reforms.
   But the United States also has spurned a Colombian request for
preferential treatment under an existing trade agreement. Colombia
is irked at the U.S. tariff on cut flowers, boosted in May, and at
its losses since the collapse of a world coffee pricing agreement
after the United States withdrew from the pact last summer.
   Bush had planned to visit five Latin American nations Sept. 16
to 22, but has put that off indefinitely because of budget
negotiations and other problems at home.
   Quayle is to return to Washington late Thursday after a stop in
Haiti, where he'll meet with military and civilian leaders of an
interim government to urge support for elections scheduled on Nov.
4.

   An army-backed caretaker government
with sweeping emergency powers consolidated control today after
Benezir Bhutto's administration was dismissed in what one diplomat
called ``a constitutional coup.''
   Exercising his constitutional power, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
abruptly dismissed Prime Minister Bhutto's government Monday and
dissolved the National Assembly, the law-making lower house of
Parliament.
   ``Corruption and nepotism in the federal government has reached
such proportions'' that the people have lost faith in the
government, the president said in a statement.
   Ishaq Khan set new elections for Oct. 24 and declared a state of
emergency, saying national security was ``threatened by external
aggression and by internal disturbances.''
   The president did not elaborate, but his statement likely
referred to border tensions with neighboring India and ethnic
violence in Ms. Bhutto's home province of Sindh that has left
hundreds dead.
   Opposition leader Mustafa Jatoi was sworn in as acting prime
minister Monday. Most of those attending the ceremony were members
of the military high command.
   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Pakistani
army strongly supported Ishaq Khan's move. They said the army has
become increasingly impatient with Ms. Bhutto's unwillingness to
find a political solution to the ethnic violence and her perceived
meddling in military affairs.
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, said the military,
which has ruled the country for 25 years of its 43-year history,
had no intention of seizing power.
   ``We are not going to get involved in politics,'' Beg said.
   Ms. Bhutto, 37, said in a statement before leaving for her home
in the southern port city of Karachi that the president's action
was ``arbitrary, illegal and unconstitional.''
   But she said she did not believe the president had betrayed her.
   ``Other forces wanted me out,'' a subdued Ms. Bhutto told a news
conference.
   The president's decision caught members of Ms. Bhutto's
government by surprise, but opponents said the president starting
drafting the order two months ago.
   ``She has nobody to blamed but herself. She had plenty of
warnings,'' said Abida Hussein, a former lawmaker and one of Ms.
Bhutto's most outspoken critics.
   ``This was a kind of constitutional coup staged while world
attention was focused on the events of Kuwait and Iraq,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But something had
to be done. If things had continued, the only ultimate solution
would have been martial law.''
   Shortly after Ishaq Khan dissolved the government, the army took
control of the state-run television network and the telephone and
telegraph exchange. Soldiers were deployed throughout the capital.
   Emergency rule, valid for up to four months, allows the
president and the caretaker government to suspend individual rights
and civilian courts and to make laws.
   Educated at Harvard and Oxford Ms. Bhutto inherited the
political mantle of her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto. He was ousted by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in a 1977
coup and hanged two years later.
   Zia himself was killed, in a mysterious plane crash on Aug. 17,
1988. His death led to the first democratic elections after more
than a decade of military rule.
   When Ms. Bhutto, who led her party to victory, took office in
December 1988, she pledged to restore democracy and her family name.
   But many diplomats and political analysts say Ms. Bhutto never
made the transition from a fighter of political oppression to prime
minister.
   Her popular support, rated at 54 percent when she took office,
was steadily eroded by mounting accusations of corruption against
senior Cabinet ministers and members of her family, including her
husband, Asif Zardari. None of the allegations was proved, but a
poll released last month showed Ms. Bhutto's popularity had tumbled
to 34 percent.

   Cleanup crews hoped to scrape up the last pockets
of oil today along a seven-mile stretch of shoreline stained by a
massive spill in Galveston Bay.
   About 700,000 gallons of oil spilled into the busy bay July 28
after a tanker collided with two barges in the Houston Ship Channel.
   One barge remained crippled in the channel today, blocking
traffic. Crews were scouring its emptied tanks so the vessel could
be cut up and moved out of the way.
   ``We don't want to cut it open and have a mini-oil spill added
to what we've already got,'' said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer
Rick Meidt. Also, a cutting torch could ignite a fire if the tanks
are oily, he said.
   A few heavy patches of oil remained along the shoreline today
and a light sheen floated about two miles into the bay.
   ``They're going to try and get the very last of it,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Scott Campbell. ``They've already released some
cleanup crews. They're just isn't that much to do.''
   Campbell said cleanup crews might be finished by the end of the
day. However, other officials said it probably would take the rest
of the week to finish the cleanup, estimated to cost $5 million.
   The channel was open Monday to two-way barge traffic, but
deep-draft ships were allowed only one way at a time because their
wakes could disrupt the salvage operations.
   The heavy, black oil stained several beaches, seeped into some
marshes and collected around several residential docks. However,
officials said it spared other marshes that are breeding grounds
for much marine life.
   Crews used vacuum trucks again Monday to clean up oil on shore.
   More than 300,000 gallons of an oil-and-water mixture has been
picked up so far, said Meidt.
   Crews also sprayed oil-gobbling microbes on a marsh south of
Cedar Bayou, said Campbell. The microbes were sprayed on another
marsh Sunday and a beach last week.
   The microbes, used in a process call bioremediation, reduce the
oil to a fatty emulsion that is eaten by marine animals.
   Coast Guard officials said they received no reports of injured
birds or wildlife.
   However, Larry McKinney, director of the resource protection
division of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said his crews
found some dead crabs, mussels, small fish and other small marine
animals along the shores around Houston Point.

   The CIA and FBI dismissed as ``ludicrous'' and
``not credible'' renewed claims that the CIA had a hand in the
assassination of President Kennedy and allegations one gunman is
living in secrecy in Texas.
   Ricky Don White, an unemployed oilfield worker, claimed on
Monday that his father, a Dallas police department employee acting
on orders from the CIA, fired the shots that killed Kennedy.
White's father, Roscoe White, died in 1971.
   The CIA broke a longstanding policy against commenting on
alleged covert operations to deny the story.
   ``These allegations _ that this was done on CIA orders, that
this guy worked for us and that CIA had any role in the
assassination of President Kennedy _ are ludicrous,'' CIA spokesman
Mark Mansfield said in Washington.
   The FBI said in a statement that it had received the same
information in 1988 but ``determined that this information is not
credible.''
   The story adds another conspiracy theory to the bulging file on
the assassination, even though the Warren Commission concluded that
Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, shot the president from the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository. In 1978, a divided House
committee concluded that Oswald shot the president but that a
second gunman also fired a shot that day that missed.
   Theories have circulated for years that the CIA had a part in
the assassination.
   White gave his account at a news conference Monday, although he
had been shopping his story to reporters for some time.
   His claim was backed by his mother, Geneva White Galle, who told
The Odessa American ``there is no doubt in my mind that my husband
did shoot Kennedy.'' She was married to Roscoe White for 15 years,
and remarried after White died.
   Mrs. Galle, who has terminal cancer, said she wished the
information had been revealed sooner and added, ``I lost my health
because of it.''
   In his news conference, Ricky White did not repeat an earlier
contention that one of the three purported co-conspirators lives a
reclusive, fearful existence near Dallas.
   However, Gary Shaw, who helped organize Monday's event, said the
co-conspirator was not mentioned ``because we want to approach this
in a way not to make them run.''
   At the news conference, White said he hoped his story would
result in a book and movie contract.
   White said much of his theory is based on information he said
was in a diary kept by his father, who served in the Marines with
Oswald. White said the diary _ which he showed to no one _ is
missing, and suggested it was taken by the FBI.
   White, who lives in Midland, said his father joined the Police
Department three months before the assassination in 1963 to carry
out the plot.
   White claimed the diary shows his father was on a grassy knoll
in front of the presidential motorcade and fired two shots that
struck Kennedy. Oswald was part of the conspiracy but fired no
shots, White said.
   White said his father also killed police Officer J.D. Tippit
about an hour after the assassination. Tippit's slaying has been
blamed on Oswald.
   White died at age 35 in what his son called a suspicious fire
and explosion at an equipment company in suburban Garland, where he
was shop foreman. White said he believes a CIA ``witness
elimination'' squad killed his father.
   Ricky White made his claims at the JFK Assassination Information
Center, a private group that researches assassination theories.

<HEAD>Attorney For Woman Cited In Archbishop's Resignation Says She Was
Manipulated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman whose relationships with Archbishop
Eugene Marino and a priest led to their resignations was seduced by
the bishop but never had sex with the priest, her attorney said.
   The woman, Vicki R. Long, 27, of Riverdale, has accused a third
priest of fathering her child.
   Louisiana attorney Anthony Fontana said Monday that some people
might consider Ms. Long a seductress, but ``once the facts come
out, the public will know ... grown women can suffer sexual abuse
even in a relationship not termed to be perverse. One person can
make demands and manipulate the other to satisfy those demands.''
   Fontana, known for arguing sexual abuse cases against the Roman
Catholic Church, said Marino manipulated his client into a sexual
relationship to which she did not consent.
   ``She went to see Archbishop Marino for counseling and pastoral
help'' in dealing with sexual abuse, Fontana said. ``He took
advantage of that situation, manipulating that situation.''
   Archdiocese spokesman Peter Dora said he does not believe Marino
would ``take advantage of anyone,'' but declined to comment further.
   Fontana said Ms. Long ``categorically denies'' she had a sexual
relationship with the Rev. Michael Woods, a Sandy Springs priest
who resigned Saturday after admitting he had an ``intimate''
relationship with her.
   Woods, who said he was the godfather of Ms. Long's 4-year-old
daughter, previously was Ms. Long's pastor at a Hapeville church.
   ``She doesn't deny (the relationship) was intimate but she
categorically denies it was sexual,'' said Fontana.
   Ms. Long may file a lawsuit against the church, he said.
   Archdiocese officials confirmed last week that Marino, 56,
formerly the nation's highest-ranking black Catholic, resigned
earlier this year because of an ``intimate relationship'' with Ms.
Long that involved paying her $1,500 a month.
   The archdiocese said it would investigate whether church funds
were paid improperly to Ms. Long. Fontana said Monday that his
client was certain church funds were used.
   Marino has not commented publicly on his relationship with Ms.
Long.
   Ms. Long also has refused to comment.
   Several years ago, she filed a paternity suit claiming that
another priest, Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus, Ga., fathered her
daughter. He denied paternity, and blood tests supported him, but
the archdiocese is paying her child support. Church officials
decline to explain why.
   In December 1987, Fontana represented an altar boy who sued the
church claiming the Rev. Gilbert Gauthe of Lafayette, La., molested
him. A jury awarded the boy $1.55 million and his parents $250,000.
Gauthe is serving a 20-year sentence on the molestation charges.

<HEAD>Turkey Appears Ready to Cut Iraqi Pipeline as Pressure Increases
on Saddam</HEAD>

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Cheney in Egypt, latest oil
prices, CORRECTS attribution from Turkish government on pipeline.

^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The economic pressure increased on an increasingly isolated
Saddam Hussein today as Turkey agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions
against Iraq, which likely would involve closing a pipeline
carrying Iraqi oil through its territory.
   A worldwide trade embargo already forced Iraq to stop the flow
through one of its two Turkish pipelines and sharply reduce it in
the other. Oil executives said today Iraq's use of a Saudi Arabian
pipeline also had been drastically cut, because there was no one to
buy the oil once it reached the other end.
   If successful, the U.N.-ordered embargo could cripple Iraq's
oil-dependent economy.
   In other developments today:
   _Jordan appeared ready to provide an overland escape route for
foreigners caught in Kuwait, which Iraqi troops have occupied since
Thursday.
   _Travelers said Saudi Arabia deployed missiles along its border
with Kuwait facing the Iraqi military buildup.
   _Defense Secretary Dick Cheney arrived in Egypt for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak on the crisis. Mubarak has been trying to
mediate the dispute.
   _The Tokyo Stock Exchange followed its New York counterpart
today, plunging 3.32 percent on fears of economic fallout from the
Persian Gulf crisis. Oil prices rose, with Brent North Sea crude
oil trading at $27.75 per barrel, up $1.40 from its close Monday in
New York.
   The Turkish government announced today it would comply with a
U.N. Security Council vote Monday ordering broad economic sanctions
against Iraq to pressure it to withdraw from Kuwait.
   When asked if Turkey would close a pipeline pumping hundreds of
thousands of barrels of Iraqi crude oil through his country, State
Minister Mehmet Yazar said: ``These details of implementing the
U.N. decision are being worked out.''
   But a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Turkey intended to shut down the pipeline, which carries Iraqi oil
to a terminal on the Mediterranean for export.
   On Monday, Turkish officials said Iraq informed them it had
slashed the pipeline's capacity to 70 percent and closed its second
Turkish pipeline because of the reduced market for Iraqi oil.
   Oil executives in Saudi Arabia said today Iraq also
significantly reduced the flow of petroleum through a pipeline
across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. One executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the flow through the Saudi pipeline,
which had been about 800,000 barrels a day, was down to 200,000
barrels. Others said they thought the flow was somewhat higher.
   The Saudi and Turkish pipelines carry more than two-thirds of
Iraq's daily oil output of about 3 million barrels. Iraq also pumps
oil through the Persian Gulf.
   The Washington Post reported today that Saddam summoned U.S.
charge d'affaires Joseph Wilson in Baghdad on Monday and threatened
to attack Saudi Arabia if Iraqi pipelines through that country were
closed.
   Oil is at the root of the crisis. Iraq invaded Kuwait after
accusing it of cheating on OPEC production quotas and driving down
the price of oil. It also alleged that Kuwait stole $2.4 billion
worth of oil from a field that includes land both sides claim.
   Kuwait and Iraqi officials met Aug. 1 in an attempt to resolve
their differences, but the talks broke down. Iraq invaded Kuwait
the next day, drove out the ruling family, and installed a
government.
   The Iraqi forces also moved within a few miles of the Saudi
border, raising fears they would try to occupy the kingdom, which
is the world's No. 1 oil producer.
   Travelers in the region said today Saudi Arabia had deployed
missiles along the Kuwaiti border. The civilian travelers said they
saw large numbers of what they described as Saudi ``guided
missiles.'' On the other side of the border, they reported a large
number of Iraqi tanks.
   The publisher of a Lebanese newspaper, Talal Salman of the
leftist As-Safir in Beirut, said in a front-page article today that
the Iraqis ``have installed missiles to strike at Saudi Arabia's
oil wells'' in the event of an attack from Saudi Arabia.
   In Jordan, Iraqi, U.S. and Jordanian officials said Iraq was
considering allowing foreigners, including U.S. Embassy staff and
dependents, to leave Iraq and Kuwait by land through Jordan.
   A senior Jordanian official said: ``Any foreigner who wishes to
depart Iraq or Kuwait through Jordan is more than welcomed.''
   A Kuwaiti businessman who escaped the occupied sheikdom said
conditions were getting worse there and that people were fleeing
across the desert to Saudi Arabia at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
   ``Some Iraqi troops are looting private houses and shops. They
particularly seem to want gold and jewelry,'' said the man, who
arrived in London toay. He refused to give his name for fear of
reprisals to his family.
   When he left Monday, the businessman said, the Iraqis were
building up heavy armaments about three miles from the Saudi border
and seemed to show no signs of withdrawing.
   Pressure grew worldwide for a naval blockade of Iraq if the U.N.
sanctions did not prove effective. The Washington Post said the
Pentagon proposed an international blockade of the Persian Gulf
that would include forces from the Soviet Union.
   The French naval destroyer Dupleix sailed into the Suez Canal
early today on its way to the Persian Gulf to join two other
warships. The Dupleix is capable of carrying helicopters and
missiles, including the sophisticated Exocet missile.
   The U.S. already has two aircraft carriers, the Independence and
the Eisenhower, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and dispatched two
more from the eastern United States. They would bolster the U.S.
presence in the gulf itself, which amounts to eight warships.
   In Ankara, a U.S. Embassy official said 14 F-111 bombers from a
U.S. base in England have been flown to Incirlik, Turkey, 425 miles
from the Iraqi border in what he called a routine regularly
scheduled transfer.
   Saudi military aircraft were sighted landing and taking off at
airfields on the fringes of Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said local
residents reached by telephone.
   Journalists in helicopters reported sighting a Soviet destroyer
nearing the Straits of Hormuz, the entrance to the gulf from the
Arabian Sea. Shipping sources, who declined identification, said no
Soviet warship had been in the Persian Gulf for two months.
   The Iraqi-installed provisional government of Kuwait announced
that it had decided to consider its currency, the dinar, the
equivalent of the Iraqi dinar. The action has no practical impact
because the Kuwait dinar is frozen on currency exchanges.
   Also today, the Beirut bureau of the Kuwait News Agency reported
the ``Kuwaiti Resistance'' released a communique announcing three
attacks against the Iraqi invasion army, killing or wounding 11
Iraqis. The report did not disclose the times of the attacks. It
could not be independently confirmed.

   Israeli-affiliated militiamen killed two
Palestinian guerrillas in an ambush on the northern edge of an
Israeli-controlled zone in south Lebanon, police said today.
   A police spokesman said two guerrillas of the Libyan-backed
Palestine Popular Struggle Front were killed Monday while trying to
cross into Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia spotted the
guerrillas as they were trying to infiltrate into the security zone
east of Sidon, the southern provincial capital.
   The police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the guerrillas were killed in a brief firefight with the militia.
   Later Monday, guerrillas fired seven surface-to-surface Katyusha
rockets into Marjayoun, a town in the security zone where the
militia is headquartered.
   The militia-run Voice of the South radio said the rockets
exploded in empty fields near the town, causing no casualties.
   Israel established the 440-square-mile security zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its army from southern Lebanon in 1985, ending
a three-year occupation of Lebanon.
   The zone serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
infiltration into northern Israel.

   Rebel leader Prince Johnson, who holds
several foreign hostages, says he will attack American Marines at
the U.S. Embassy if the U.S. or other foreign troops do not
intervene to end Liberia's civil war.
   Some of the 235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia to evacuate
Americans and other foreign nationals on Monday took up defensive
positions within the walled U.S. Embassy compound.
   Johnson presented eight foreign hostages to reporters and said
he would not free them until a peacekeeping force comes to this
West African nation torn by a 7-month-old tribal conflict in which
5,000 people have died.
   Johnson, who killed a relief worker Friday who he said was
selling rice to Monrovia's starving citizens, said he had killed
one Liberian congressman for spying and would kill another.
   The hostages, kidnapped Monday night from Hotel Africa, on the
northwestern outskirts of Monrovia, include an American, an
Argentine, three Britons, two West Germans and a Dutchman.
   The U.S. State Department said Johnson was holding 14 or 15
hostages. The British Foreign Office said there were 16, including
four Britons. There was no explanation for the discrepancy in the
number of people kidnapped.
   On Saturday, Johnson warned that his fighters, who hold most of
Monrovia, would start detaining foreigners to provoke international
intervention in Liberia.
   ``What this country really needs is the peaceful intervention of
the United States or'' the Economic Community of West African
States, Johnson told rebel fighters outside his headquarters on
Monrovia's Bushrod Island.
   ``If they don't intervene I will attack the American Marines.''
   Washington has said the Marines' only role in the conflict is to
evacuate endangered nationals, and protect U.S. installations and a
skeletal staff remaining at the U.S. Embassy.
   The U.S. mission in Liberia included staff and families
numbering more than 500 before rebels invaded Dec. 24 from
Liberia's northeastern border with Ivory Coast and advanced to the
Atlantic Ocean capital.
   West African leaders decided Monday to send troops into Liberia,
saying the war is affecting the entire region, which is supporting
nearly 400,000 refugees from the nation of 2.3 million people.
   Sources at the summit said a naval task force to include ships
from Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Guinea will go to Monrovia
and troops will be sent across Liberia's land borders with Sierra
Leone and Guinea.
   Not represented at the conference was Liberia's third neighbor,
Ivory Coast, which has supported rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   Johnson, a former captain in President Samuel Doe's army, was
one of Taylor's chief commanders before he set up a splinter rebel
faction in February.
   Taylor has said he opposed any foreign intervention and has said
he will attack any foreign peace enforcers.
   But today, Taylor's National Patriotic Front said it might
accept such a force. The Front's Defense Minister Tom Woewiyu flew
to Bangul, Gambia, to meet with representatives of the West African
nations that are considering sending in troops.
   Woewiyu appeared to indicate that as long as the force remained
neutral it would be welcome.
   Refugees behind Taylor's rebel lines at the U.S. Omega
ship-tracking station near Paynesville gave a letter to The
Associated Press appealing to the United States or any other
government to help end the war.
   ``We are beseeching you to make the international world come to
our aid. We are being slaughtered like pigs by our government, the
freedom fighters and anyone who feels we should not live,'' the
letter said.
   Johnson said his men executed Liberian Sen. Fred J. Blay on
Sunday night. The rebel leader claimed Blay, a former minister for
youth and sports, had been sent by Doe to spy on his headquarters.
He said Blay was shot dead by a firing squad.
   Then he presented to journalists Congressman William Jabrah and
said he, too, would be executed for spying. The legislator was led
away with his hands bound.
   The foreign hostages presented at the news conference identified
themselves as: Terry Good, 67, a British mining engineer from
Essex; Seymour Grann, 32, a British businessman; Paul Temple, 36, a
British timber merchant; Dieter Riech, 53, a West German; Klaus
Moffer, 58, West German managing director of a soap factory; Chris
Mendes, 27, an American mining contractor from Sacramento, Calif.;
Abraham Lokker, 57, a Dutch mining engineer; Enrique Mansilla, 32,
an Argentine mining engineer.

   A fire burned through the night at
Poland's holiest shrine, the Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa,
and two monks were injured while saving centuries-old volumes from
the library.
   The jewel-robed Black Madonna, the burnished icon to which
millions of pilgrims pay homage each Aug. 15, was not damaged, said
Sister Daria at the Roman Catholic curia in Czestochowa.
   The monks suffered smoke inhalation while rushing through the
burning building to save books, including some illuminated
manuscripts dating to the 15th century, from the library built in
1739. Polish radio said they were in stable condition.
   The fire started at 10:35 p.m. Monday and was extinguished at
8:30 this morning, said Father Simon Stefanowicz at the monastery.
Radio said it appeared to have been caused by a short circuit.
   Stefanowicz said there was no significant damage to the many
historical objects housed at Jasna Gora, which was founded in 1382
by the hermetic Paulite order from Hungary.
   However, firefighters had to break through the copper roof of
the building where the fire broke out. In addition to the library
and the archives, the building houses a small hotel for visiting
priests and the editorial offices of a monthly monastery bulletin.
   The damaged building is adjacent to the chapel in which the icon
is housed.
   More than 15,000 pilgrims left Warsaw on Monday to begin the
nine-day walk to Czestochowa for Assumption Day on Aug. 15, a
tradition that has been maintained every year since 1711.
   En route to the monastery, 175 miles southeast of Warsaw, the
pilgrims will be joined by faithful from parishes nationwide,
camping in fields and churches.
   Up to 170,000 pilgrims make the trip on foot, many covering the
final miles on their knees. In all, a half-million worshippers are
expected to fill the field at the monastery.
   Jasna Gora, or Bright Mountain, rests on a brick fortification
and houses an extensive collection of Polish historical objects,
from the weapons of kings to tear-gas grenades lobbed at Solidarity
protesters.
   It provided sanctuary for the Solidarity movement through its
decade-long fight against Poland's Communist government.
   The Black Madonna was brought to the monastery in 1384 by Duke
Ladislaus of Opole, adviser to Louis of Anjou, King of Poland and
Hungary. Many miracles have been attributed to the doleful
painting, including a 1655 siege in which 70 monks and 180
supporters held off nearly 4,000 soldiers from the Protestant
Swedish army and inspired the country to rise up and throw out the
invaders.

<HEAD>Former De Gaulle Minister Jacques Soustelle Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacques Soustelle, a former Cabinet minister who
clashed with Gen. Charles de Gaulle over the Algerian conflict,
died today in the suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the Academie
Francaise announced. He was 78.
   A distinguished anthropologist noted for his study of
pre-Colombian culture, Soustelle was named to the prestigious
Academie in 1983. The organization's terse statement announcing his
death did not give a cause of death or list survivors.
   Born in Montpellier, Soustelle studied letters at the Ecole
Normale Superieure and married Georgette Fagot in 1931. They made
several scientific missions to Central America during the 1930s.
   Strongly opposed to fascism, Soustelle was among the first to
rally to de Gaulle's appeal on June 18, 1940 from London to fight
the Vichy government that collaborated with Nazi Germany.
   After the liberation of France in 1944, Soustelle worked as
minister of information and later minister of colonies. He served
as governor of Algeria in 1955-56 during the outbreak of the war
for independence.
   De Gaulle returned to power in 1958 as the Algerian war
threatened to tear France apart. Soustelle again became minister of
information and later a deputy foreign minister.
   The two men had a falling out when de Gaulle made clear his
intention to grant independence to the North African country.
Soustelle resigned, saying he could not ``make a deal with
cutthroats.''
   Soustelle left France in 1961 and was charged Sept. 22, 1962
with ``attempts against the state.'' The same year, renegade army
officers tried to assassinate de Gaulle for giving Algeria
independence.
   Soustelle lived in exile until 1968, when he returned to France
under a general amnesty and resumed his academic and political
career. The Academie made him a member June 2, 1983 for his studies
of ancient American culture, outlined in such books as ``Life of
the Aztecs'' and ``The Maya Civilization.''
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

   More than 20,000 demonstrators
protesting rises in food prices were briefly detained today after
they scuffled with police outside Parliament, police said.
   The marchers were organized by the Congress Party of former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Police said they had orders to stop the asssmbly of more than
five people around the red sandstone parliament building.
   ``We have strict orders not to allow any demonstration to reach
the Parliament,'' said a police officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``We had to stop the Congressmen.'' He was referring to
the members of the Congress Party.
   Policemen and commandos armed with machine pistols and automatic
rifles guarded the parliament complex as members inside began a
debate on inflation.
   But outside the Gandhi supporters shouted slogans calling for
the resignation of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   A senior police officer then took a microphone and announced
that the 20,000 demonstrators were under arrest.
   Some of the protesters then scuffled with policemen. The 20,000
demonstrators were briefly detained and released.
   Since Singh came to power last November prices of vegetables
doubled and gasoline rose 25 percent. Overall inflation is about 10
percent.
   Singh's National Front coalition came to power last year after
the Congress Party failed to win enough seats in the November 1989
elections.

   Andrew Young took his underdog bid to become Georgia's first
black governor to the voters today in a runoff for the Democratic
nomination against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller. Kansas and Michigan also
were holding primaries for governor.
   Max Cleland, Georgia's secretary of state, predicted just 38
percent of the state's 2.7 million registered voters would cast
ballots, and early turnout was slow in some areas.
   ``We had a flowing river three weeks ago and today we had a
trickle,'' said Liz Thompson, poll manager at the Jewish Community
Center in Atlanta.
   Forty-four percent of eligible voters turned out for the July 17
primary, in which Miller got 41 percent of the vote and Young
received 29 percent.
   Young, a former Atlanta mayor and ambassador to the United
Nations, and Miller spent Monday traveling around the state and
thanking black supporters on the 25th anniversary of President
Lyndon B. Johnson's signing of the Voting Rights Act.
   ``We've been tracking Zell Miller all day like a hound dog after
a scared rabbit and we're going to catch him,'' Young said after
arriving in Augusta and Savannah as Miller left. Young trailed by
about 20 points in two polls last week.
   Miller said he was optimistic. Repeating a favorite campaign
phrase, he quoted an inscription on a mountain tombstone: ``I done
my durndest.''
   Race had rarely been mentioned during their three-week campaign
after the two survived a five-man contest in the primary.
   Georgia requires a runoff if no candidate receives more than
half the vote, but the requirement was under challenge as
discriminatory against blacks, who make up about 28 percent of
Georgia's voters.
   On Monday, Young referred to his days in the civil rights
movement and spoke of his accomplishments on behalf of blacks. He
took a jab at Miller's pet issue, establishment of a state lottery.
   ``I don't believe anybody marched, I don't believe anybody went
to jail _ or died, for certain _ for a lottery,'' Young said.
   Miller appeared before about 50 members of the Political
Advisory Council of Chatham County, a black group that endorsed him
over Young. Miller said the group helped him when he won his first
race for lieutenant governor.
   ``Now, 16 years later, when it's so difficult to do what you're
doing, you're reaching out to me again,'' Miller said.
   The winner of the primary will meet Republican state Rep. Johnny
Isakson in the November election. Two-term Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a
Democrat, is not eligible to seek re-election.
   In Kansas, Republican Gov. Mike Hayden braced in his bid for a
second, four-year term for a strong primary challenge from real
estate agent Nestor Weigand of Wichita.
   Democratic former Gov. John Carlin was favored to win the
Democratic nod to seek his old job.
   In Michigan, state Senate Majority Leader John Engler was
expected to win easily over General Motors Corp. engineer John
Lauve in the GOP primary for governor.
   Engler has focused on Democratic Gov. James Blanchard and his
own 20 years' experience in the Legislature. Blanchard, seeking a
third, four-year term, has no primary opponent.
   In Missouri, U.S. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt was
expected to win easily the Democratic primary for re-election in
his St. Louis district. His challenger is Nicholas F. Clement, a
supporter of right-wing extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Three Republicans were up for their party's nomination in the
district.

   No one immediately claimed repsonsibility for the attack.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Wisconsin's School Choice Program Constitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program that would let poor Milwaukee
children attend private schools at state expense has been declared
constitutional by a state judge, apparently clearing the way for it
to begin this fall.
   Dane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Steingass ruled Monday
that the state's school choice program was legal because it served
to improve education quality and thus met the ``public purpose''
requirement of the Wisconsin Constitution.
   ``I conclude that education is a public purpose and that the
program is the Legislature's reasonable assessment of how to
improve the quality of education to the benefit of the entire
state,'' Ms. Steingass wrote.
   In addition, the judge ruled that State School Superintendent
Herbert Grover, who must administer the program but has publicly
opposed it, exceeded his authority in demanding certain
requirements of participating private schools, including complex
forms that are difficult to fill out.
   She ordered Grover to redraft his the forms or face further
court action.
   Grover did not immediately return a telephone message left at
his home Monday night seeking comment on the decision.
   The school choice program, approved by the Legislature and
signed by Gov. Tommy Thompson last spring, provides up to $2,500 in
state funds per pupil to let poor, inner-city Milwaukee
schoolchildren attend private schools.
   The state budget includes $2.5 million for the program this
year, meaning that the program could accommodate 1,000 students.
   It is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and
has drawn praise from the Bush administration.
   ``Judge Susan Steingass made the right decision _ one in favor
of our children,'' Thompson said Monday.
   Critics of the program, including Grover and two teachers'
unions, claim the plan undermines public education and places
pupils in private schools that are not fully accountable to the
state.
   Supporters of the program said it provides poor parents with
another choice to improve their children's education and does not
force participation.
   Clint Bolick, an attorney for the Washington-based Landmark
Legal Center Foundation for Civil Rights, said the judge's decision
``was a slam-dunk for parental choice in education.''
   ``It will stand up very well under any appeal,'' Bolick said,
adding that he doubted whether opponents would have enough time to
attempt to legally block the program before it begins in the next
few weeks.

<HEAD>Economy Called Chaotic, Unemployment Jumps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unemployment in East Germany almost doubled
between June and July, official figures released today said. The
West German official overseeing East Germany's businesses said the
economy is in chaos.
   Reiner Gohlke's remarks, published today in an East German
newspaper, are some of the most ominous to date concerning the
country's rapidly deteriorating economic situation.
   They coincided with the release of the latest official
unemployment figures showing the number of East German jobless
jumped to 272,017 last month, up from 142,096 in June.
   More than 656,000 of the nation's 8.8 million workers are
working short shifts because of the lack of demand for East German
products.
   Also today, top-level meetings got under way in both Germanys to
try to work out the precise date of German unity and the best means
of stemming East Germany's escalating economic and social problems.
   The Social Democrats _ second-largest party in both Germanys _
have demanded unity by Sept. 15.
   But the Christian Democrats of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere insist unity
must wait for all-German elections that should be held Oct. 14.
   Since the West German mark became the East German currency on
July 1, the country's 8,000 major businesses have faced increasing
difficulties staying afloat.
   ``The next six months will be the hardest,'' the newspaper Neue
Zeit quoted Gohlke as saying.
   Gohlke is President of the Trust Institute of the German
Democratic Republic. The institute was established to oversee the
East German economy's change from a state-run economy to a
capitalist system.
   There have been predictions that up to 4 million East Germans
could be out of work by early next year as businesses close.
   That, in turn, has led to predictions of a ``hot autumn'' of
worker unrest in the former Communist nation.
   ``The situation is worse than I had thought,'' Neue Zeit quoted
Gohlke as saying. ``We have chaos. Nothing is running normally.''
   The Neue Zeit newspaper is closely linked to East Germany's
Christian Democrats.
   Economists expect an economy recovery in East Germany late in
1991, after unproductive, state-run businesses either reform or
close.
   In addition, West German companies are rushing into East Germany
to set up production, and will be drawing East German workers.

   Tropical Storm Diana became Hurricane
Diana early today after picking up strength in the Gulf of Mexico,
and warnings went up along a 400-mile stretch of Mexico's gulf
coast.
   Hundreds of people fled low-lying areas, fearing Diana's heavy
rains and winds up to 80 mph.
   One man was killed when winds blew over a tree Monday night,
said Rosalio Romero Hernandez, a spokesman for the Red Cross in
Veracruz.
   The threatened area included the cities of Veracruz, Tuxpan and
Tampico. Ports were closed. Small craft were warned to remain in
port from Baffin Bay, Texas, southward.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Diana was centered about 110 miles east-southeast
of Tuxpan on the central coast, near 20.5 degreees north latitude
and 95.8 degrees west longitude. It was moving west at 12 mph, and
Mexican weather officials said it would first hit land in the area
of Tuxpan.
   In Tuxpan, Red Cross spokeswoman Matilde Alvino said there were
heavy winds and rains and a few reports of early flooding. Area
rivers were on the rise, she said.
   The captain of the port of Tuxpan, Miguelangel Rebolledo, said
the Mexican navy installation there was sheltering about 300 people
who had fled low-lying areas.
   Diana is the second storm of the Atlantic season to reach
hurricane strength.
   Rainfall of 10 inches or more was expected along its path, said
Max Mayfield, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center near
Miami. Tides were expected to be four to six feet above normal, he
said.
   ``The main threat to life will be the rising waters on the coast
and the heavy rains producing flash floods and possibly mud slides
inland,'' said Mayfield.
   Diana soaked Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Monday but did little
damage as a tropical storm.
   Meanwhile, tropical storm Cesar weakened to a tropical
depression in the mid-Atlantic on Monday. Cesar was 1,150 miles
east-southeast of Bermuda with top sustained winds of nearly 35
mph. Little movement was expected today.
   The hurricane center also reported a new depression formed
Monday about 175 miles southwest of the westernmost Azores island
in the mid-Atlantic.
   Tropical depressions become named storms once sustained winds
reach 39 mph. A storm becomes a hurricane when winds hit 74 mph.

<HEAD>Florida-based Carrier Heading for Mediterranean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The aircraft carrier Saratoga and four escort ships steamed out
of their home port en route for the Mediterranean and possible
Mideast duty today, and 2,500 Marines boarded ships bound for the
coast of war-torn Liberia.
   The mood aboard the Saratoga was ``professional and
work-oriented but concerned,'' said Chief Petty Officer Charles
Underwood, a spokesman for the Mayport Naval Station at
Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``I think this force is probably going over toward that area and
if something happens, these boys can handle it,'' said Wade Andrews
of Sebring, Fla., whose son Randell was aboard the Saratoga.
   There was an air of subdued concern as parents, friends and
wives carrying babies wept, blew kisses and waved and yelled
goodbyes at dockside as the Saratoga pulled away. It was preceded
by the destroyers Spruance and Sampson, the frigate Elmer
Montgomery and the guided missile cruiser Philippine Sea.
   Both deployments had been scheduled before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and the Marine mission to rescue Americans from Liberia. The
departing Marines, in fact, were scheduled to relieve the Marine
unit involved in the Liberian rescue.
   Marine Col. W.C. Fite III, commander of the 26th Marine
Expeditionary Unit leaving Camp Lejeune at Morehead City, N.C.,
said he hadn't gotten orders yet.
   ``We haven't been told about our future plans,'' Fite said at a
brief news conference as troops boarded ships. ``As far as we know,
this is a routine deployment. We have plans to go to Spain, which
is routine, and also plans if needed to go to the coast of
Monrovia, Liberia.''
   The Saratoga could be sent to the eastern Mediterranean and be
within striking distance of Iraq, but the use of carrier-based
planes from there would be complicated by having to fly through the
air space of one or more other countries and probably in-flight
refueling.
   The Saratoga is no stranger to crises in the Middle East. During
an eight-month deployment that ended in April 1986, the carrier
participated in the capture of terrorists who hijacked the liner
Achille Lauro and retaliatory air strikes against Libyan
surface-to-air missile sites and armed Libyan patrol boats in the
Gulf of Sidra.
   The ship also patroled the eastern Mediterranean during the
Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt in June 1967.
   At Morehead City, groups of Marines sat on the dock waiting to
board ships. ``If we have to do something, we're prepared to do
it,'' said Cpl. David Ellis, 22, of Chicago. ``There's no sense
worrying about something you don't have any control over.''
   ``In events like these that are taking place in Iraq and Libya,
we're obviously the nation's force of choice when it comes to
initial response,'' Capt. Scott Campbell said earlier.
   ``Everyone has an idea where we're going,'' said 1st Lt. Chris
Maxmin. ``Everyone is apprehensive and excited at the same time. I
think you're stupid if you're not.''

   A handful of protesters took ``umber-age,''
but it's out with the old and in with the new inside 64-color boxes
of Crayola Crayons, the flip-top package that was the first status
symbol for Baby Boomers.
   Crayola maker Binney &amp; Smith created eight brighter colors and
given them names like jungle green, wild strawberry and vivid
tangerine.
   To make room, the company decided to ax eight classic but ho-hum
colors so that the traditional sharpener-equipped boxes could be
preserved, said spokesman Brad Drexler.
   A ceremony this morning inducting the ``retired'' colors into
the newly established ``Crayola Hall of Fame'' was picketed by
about a dozen people who said they would miss maize, raw umber,
lemon yellow, blue gray, violet blue, green blue, orange red and
orange yellow.
   ``Binney &amp; Smith, America takes umber-age,'' said one sign.
``Indians call it maize, we call it gone,'' said another.
   The 5-foot-10 models of the retired colors stand in plastic
tubes in front of Crayola's production center. Each has a plaque
extolling the color's virtues.
   ``We'll all miss these retired colors. That's why we started the
Hall of Fame, so people can come by and see them whenever they want
to,'' said Tom Muller, general manager of Binney &amp; Smith's Crayola
division.
   Joining the list of new colors aimed at a fresh generation of
children are dandelion, fuchsia, teal blue, royal purple and
cerulean, a darker version of Crayola's sky blue.
   Thousands who grew up with the old colors and some youngsters
using them now called or wrote Binney &amp; Smith to complain, but the
change was prompted by child surveys in the first place, so the
company went forward with the plan.
   For members of the Baby Boom generation, the flip-top crayon box
with all the colors and the built-in sharpener was a childhood
status symbol akin to today's designer sneakers and Nintendo video
game sets.
   ``It was always the haves versus the have-nots,'' Drexler said.
``I never had a 64 until I worked here. Now I have two.''
   He said the 64-color box was nearly eliminated, but Binney &amp;
Smith feared a backlash.
   ``The first idea was to make the 64-box a 72-box, but then we
thought of the Coke scenario and believed we'd be messing with a
classic,'' Drexler said.
   Complaints came anyway, especially regarding a well-known color
with a little-known name _ raw umber. It's the golden-brown crayon
many children favor for adding detail to tree trunks.
   Ebony Faison, a 10-year-old from Philadelphia, loves raw umber
for a more personal reason.
   ``Raw umber is the color of me,'' she wrote. ``What color should
I color now?''

<HEAD>Analysts Say Interest Increases Threaten Home Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sluggish home sales that had picked up lately
as mortgage rates fell are under a new threat from rising interest
rates resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, analysts said
Tuesday.
   ``The single factor that affects housing nationally is mortgage
financing,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist with the
National Association of Realtors.
   Tuccillo and other economists said Tuesday that a worldwide
embargo on oil from Iraq and occupied Kuwait will result in price
increases for most goods, including a likely rise in mortgage rates
of .25 to .50 percentage points in the near term.
   ``If they go up .50 now and the thing is resolved in a few
weeks, they will go down .50 and will continue going down,''
Tuccillo contended. ``If the crisis lingers on ... mortgage rates
are going to go up and they'll stay up and housing's going to be in
pretty bad shape.''
   Robert Van Order, chief economist with the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, said a .25 percentage point
increase in rates would result in an additional mortgage payment of
$25 a month on a $100,000 house.
   According to weekly surveys by Freddie Mac, the average cost
fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage fell from its 1990 peak of 10.67
percent in May to 9.84 percent last Friday. The rates do not
include add-on fees known as oints.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said that when mortgage rates
began falling in May, buyers resumed house hunting, particularly in
areas with relatively affordable prices.
   As a result, the Commerce Department reported gains in new home
sales during May and June after five consecutive monthly declines.
   And the Realtors said sales of existing homes, which represent
about 80 percent of the housing market, posted a 1.2 percent
increase in June. It was their first advance in seven months.
   But the decline in existing home sales in April and May resulted
in a 0.5 percent drop in overall resales during the second quarter
compared to the same period of 1989, the Realtors said Tuesday.
   According to their most recent survey, second-quarter resales
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.68 million units,
compared to 3.70 million units during the April-June period of last
year. Sales dropped 2.7 percent from the first quarter to the
second.
   By region, sales were off 14.5 percent to 650,000 units at an
annual rate in the Northeast and 3.1 percent to 620,000 units in
the West. Sales gained 4.4 percent to 1.41 million units in the
South and 4.2 percent to 990,000 units in the Midwest.
   The Realtors said that in addition to rising mortgage rates,
they were concerned over the effect of the government's sale of a
large volume of properties in the Southwest that had been acquired
from failed savings and loans.
   In their survey, the Realtors found the U.S. median price was
$96,200, a 3.4 percent increase over the second quarter of 1990.
The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   The median price in the West declined 0.8 percent to $138,300,
while it rose 5.8 percent in the Midwest to $75,000. It rose 1.5
percent to $86,200 in the South but fell 1.6 percent to $143,500 in
the Northeast.
   By city, the median price of an existing home ranged from
$345,000 in Honolulu to $45,100 in Youngstown, Ohio.

   An explosion and fire at a
chemical plant killed one person and seriously burned 12 others, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The explosion and fire Monday at the plant in Zilina, some 100
miles northeast of Bratislava, caused no significant leakage of
toxic gas, the daily Prace reported.
   ``The fire produced black smoke, but the smoke did not contain
toxic materials in concentrations which would represent any health
hazard,'' Prace quoted Peter Nemcok, director of the plant, as
saying.
   It was unclear what kind of gases were involved.

   A bomb attached to the underside of a car fell off
the vehicle in southwestern Moscow, but police safely defused it,
the Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
   The device apparently fell off the car because magnets failed to
hold it in place, according to the report, which did not say when
the incident occurred or offer any possible motive for such an
attack. Tass also did not say who owned the car.
   A. Knyazev, a nearby resident, said he saw the bomb fall off the
car as the auto drove away, according to Tass. Police then cordoned
off the area and defused the bomb.
   The bomb was ``expertly made'' and could have destroyed the car
and damaged buildings over a wide area, Tass said.
   Authorities began an investigation into the incident.

<HEAD>Turkey Turns Back Tankers, Shuts Iraqi Pipeline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Turkey announced today it has stopped
tankers from loading Iraqi oil from the last operating pipeline
through the country, blocking the route for half of Iraq's oil
exports.
   Turkey also announced it was stopping all exports to Iraq, with
the exception of medicine and food. Imports were also being halted.
   Mehmet Kececiler, Turkish minister in charge of oil affairs,
said Iraq could continue to pump crude through the pipeline until
the storage tanks at the terminal were full but then must stop
pumping. He said it would take about six days to reach capacity in
the tanks.
   Iraq on Monday shut down one pipeline in Turkey and reduced the
flow to 70 percent in the other because the international embargo
against Iraq had shrunk the market. The embargo protests Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Thursday.
   The Turkish pipelines carry more than half of Iraq's daily oil
output to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the Mediterranean..
   Kececiler told reporters that Turkey notified Iraq's State Oil
Marketing Organization of its decision to halt loading from the
second pipeline this afternoon.
   He said the U.N. Security Council vote Monday imposing broad
economic sanctions against Iraq was binding for all member states.
   ``That is why we took this decision. We were not pressured by
anyone,'' Kececiler said.
   Only one tanker, from Morocco, came to the terminal today but
was turned back, he said.
   Earlier in the day President Turgut Ozal said that ``there
should be no more loading'' by tankers of Iraqi oil at the terminal.
   The U.N. measure bans all imports from Iraq and Kuwait. It also
prohibits any activities, including the transfer of funds, that
would help Iraq and Kuwait export their goods and forbids loans to
the two countries.
   Turkey's border post with Iraq at Habur remained opened today,
the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. But the dispatch
said Iraq was not allowing travelers other than its own citizens to
enter the country.
   The Washington Post reported today that Iraq has threatened to
invade Saudi Arabia if its leaders shut down the Iraqi pipeline
running through their country.
   In another sign that the embargo on Iraqi oil was having an
effect, oil executives reported today that Iraq had significantly
reduced the flow of its oil through a pipeline across Saudi Arabia
to the Red Sea.
   They said no tankers were loading oil at the Red Sea terminals.
   Iraq's daily output is about 3 million barrels, about half of
which has been flowing through Turkey and smaller amount through
Saudi Arabia. A very small amount goes through the Persian Gulf.
   The White House announced Monday that Secretary of State James
A. Baker III would travel to Turkey this week for consultations on
the crisis set off by the Iraqi invasion.
   Turkish newspapers reported today that a number of U.S. F-111
bombers were dispatched to Turkey to the Incirlik U.S. base near
the Mediterranean.
   A U.S. Embassy official said 14 F-111s from a U.S. base in
England were flown to Incirlik in what he called a routine
regularly scheduled transfer. The official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the first group of F-111s arrived on June 20.

   A forest fire fed by hot weather and
drought conditions burned for two days at a Soviet army testing
ground in southwest Poland, the official PAP news agency said
Tuesday.
   The fire, which started Sunday, destroyed 3,200 acres of
woodland and caused damage estimated in the millions of dollars,
PAP said. It was finally put out Monday.
   The testing range and training grounds are near Legnica, where
the Soviet Union maintains one of its most important military bases
in Poland. The Soviet Union maintains about 40,000 troops in Poland.
   Fire brigades, soldiers, police officers and forest rangers used
helicopters and water tankers to fight the fire. PAP said their
efforts were hampered by dry conditions and the remote terrain.
   The cause of the fire was not determined and the provincial
prosecutor's office started an investigation, PAP said.

   Government troops tracked down and
killed 42 Tamil rebels held responsible for massacring Moslem
villagers, officials said today.
   ``We will show no mercy to these Tamil terrorists, criminals who
do not deserve to live,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne
said of rebels blamed for killing at least 193 Moslems since
Friday. Most of the villagers were slain while worshiping in
mosques.
   Wijeratne's statement in Parliament replied to opposition
criticism that government forces had not give Moslem civilians
protection against rebel attacks.
   In a separate incident a Moslem mob avenging the massacres
raided a Tamil village and killed 40 people, a Tamil politician
said today.
   Kandiah Premachandran, a member of Parliament, quoted survivors
as saying the Moslems attacked Thirraikerni village in Ampara
district and shot and stabbed residents, leaving 40 dead. The
village is 130 miles east of Colombo.
   There was no independent or police confirmation of
Premachandran's allegation.
   Premachandran is general secretary of the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front, a former guerrilla group which gave
up arms to join mainstream politics.
   The front is a bitter rival of the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, which has been accused of carrying out the
massacres.
   Saturday and Sunday at least 50 Moslems were shot or hacked to
death in Ampara district, according to officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules. They blamed the Tamil Tigers for
the incident. The Tigers have been involved in an intensive war
with government forces since June 11.
   The government launched search operations in the district for
the assailants and killed 42 rebels, the officials said. Most of
the clashes occurred Monday, they said.
   The government clamped an indefinite curfew in the eastern port
city of Trincomalee after reports of tension between Moslems and
Tamils, who are mainly Hindu. In Colombo, armed police guarded
Hindu temples to prevent outbreaks of sectarian violence.
   The weekend attacks on the Moslems follow a raid on two mosques
in the Batticaloa district Friday. At least 143 Moslem worshippers
died in machine-gun fire and grenade explosions, according to army
and witness accounts.
   The military and Moslem politicians blamed the Tigers, but a
rebel spokesman claimed the attacks were carried out by a rival
Tamil group to discredit the Tigers.
   Moslems, who make up 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim neutrality in the war between Tamil separatists and the
government. But the rebels accuse Moslems of siding with the
government.
   The eastern districts of Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee have
roughly equal populations of Tamils, Moslems and the mainly
Buddhist Sinhalese, who control the island nation's army and the
government.
   The Tamil war has been mainly directed against the Sinhalese,
whom they accuse of discrimination.
   Since June 11, at least 3,150 combatants have been killed in
fighting between Tamil rebels and the military. Hundreds of
civlians also have died, but there is no precise estimate.
   Tamil militants began fighting for an independent homeland in
1983 but agreed to a cease-fire in May 1989. That agreement was
broken after 13 months when the Tigers overran police stations
along the east coast.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
insurrection.

   A defense lawyer in the Central Park jogger
trial asked the jury today to acquit his client, charging that
detectives coerced an incriminating statement from the teen-ager
and lied about it on the witness stand.
   ``They came in here and they lied to you, and they intended to
lie to you,'' said defense attorney Michael Joseph in an 80-minute
summation in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
   The detectives persuaded 16-year-old Antron McCray to implicate
himself in written and videotaped statements by threatening the
teen with jail if he didn't cooperate, Joseph charged.
   ``It's the hope of getting out of trouble that caused the
statement to be made,'' said Joseph, the first of three defense
attorneys addressing the jury today. The prosecutor was to deliver
her summation when the defense finishes.
   The defense attorney pointed out the lack of physical evidence
linking McCray to the attack: no blood on his clothes, none of his
semen recovered from the jogger.
   He also pointed out close to a dozen discrepancies in the
testimony of police detectives in the case, charging they had lied
to the jury in an effort to get a conviction.
   Yusef Salaam, 16, Raymond Santana, 15, and McCray are charged
with raping and beating a woman jogger in Central Park and leaving
her near death the night of April 19, 1989.
   The jogger, now 30, is back at work at an investment bank but
testified she suffers from impaired sight, balance and smell. She
does not remember the attack.
   Summations were delivered one day after Salaam's mother was
ejected from the courtroom after she leapt up and screamed at the
final witness, a prosecutor.
   ``She's lying! She's lying!'' Sharonne Salaam shouted Monday as
Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein told of meeting Mrs.
Salaam at the 20th Precinct police station the night Yusef was
arrested.
   `Why are you telling all these lies? My son is innocent! You
don't have to lie like that! He passed a lie detector test and he's
innocent!'' Mrs. Salaam shouted at Fairstein.
   Two court officers escorted Mrs. Salaam from the courtroom.
   The results of lie detector tests are inadmissible. Justice
Thomas Galligan instructed the jury to ``totally disregard any
outbursts like that. It is totally inappropriate.''
   Mrs. Salaam testified that she told Fairstein right away that
her son was 15 but that the prosecutor stalled for at least an hour
while detectives continued to question the boy. It is illegal for
police to question anyone under 16 without a parent or guardian
present.
   Fairstein, however, testified that no more than 10 minutes
elapsed between the time Mrs. Salaam told her the boy was 15 and
the time the woman was allowed to see her son.

<HEAD>Congressman Requests Navy Investigation of Nimitz Nuclear System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman asked the Navy to investigate
possible safety hazards aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier
USS Nimitz after a television station broadcast allegations of
violations, an aide said today.
   U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., was assured by Adm. Bruce DeMars,
Navy director of nuclear propulsion, that his office would join the
investigation currently under way aboard the Nimitz, Dicks
spokesman George Behan said.
   The violations were alleged by four men identified as Nimitz
sailors who appeared on Seattle television station KIRO last week,
with their faces and voices masked.
   They alleged that crew members had cheated on reactor
inspections, that some nuclear operators had to work up to 100
hours a week during a month-long maintenance run at the Puget Sound
Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, and that crew members did not have
sufficient knowledge to control a nuclear accident.
   They also said some had discussed sabotaging the reactor to ease
their heavy work schedule. However, one later said the comments
were not meant as a direct threat by the four.
   Four sailors believed by the Navy to be the source of the
allegations were kept aboard as the aircraft carrier left port
Monday, despite objections from their lawyers who wanted them kept
ashore pending an independent investigation.
   The Nimitz set sail Monday night from Bremerton on a 30-day
mission.
   A Navy spokesman said the sailors' rights had not been violated,
and they would continue to be part of the investigation until the
Navy gets to the bottom of the allegations.
   Attorneys for the petty officers said the Navy had a
``vendetta'' against the four. The lawyers want independent
investigators, not the Navy, to look into the claims.
   ``We're concerned about our clients. If anything happens to
these people while they're out to sea for the next 30 days the Navy
is going to be held responsible,'' attorney Michael Withey said
Monday.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Comdr. Bob Pritchard, said in the Nimitz's
home port of San Diego that the sailors were taken off restrictive
status Monday afternoon after the Naval Investigative Service found
the threat of possible nuclear sabotage by them groundless.
   Withey would not confirm whether his clients were the ones who
appeared on KIRO last week, but did say they had been interrogated
and fingerprinted.
   In a letter to the ship's captain, Robert Williamson, Withey
demanded that the Navy stop questioning the four sailors, make
arrangements for them to stay in Bremerton while the carrier sails
and ``end the intimidating atmosphere aboard the Nimitz.''
   Pritchard said the Navy would not rule out action against the
four for possibly releasing classified information on TV, but he
denied they had been intimidated during questioning.

   West African leaders announced today they
are sending troops to end Liberia's 7-month-old civil war ``in the
interest of the African people as a whole.''
   A five-nation cease-fire monitoring group led by a Ghanaian
commander and deputy commanded from Guinea will go to Liberia, said
a statement at the end of a two-day summit of the Economic
Community of West Africa.
   It did not say when the troops would go. Summit sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity said the force probably would
involve a naval task force and possibly troops sent by land from
neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea.
   The troops would impose a cease-fire that would allow the
establishment of a broad-based interim government charged with
organizing free and fair elections, said the announcement. None of
the warring parties would be permitted to participate in the
interim government unless they did not wish to stand in the
elections, the communique said.
   It ``assured the people of Liberia that the sole purpose of the
... peacekeeping force is to create the necessary conditions for
normal life to resume to the benefit of all Liberians.''
   The summit called for the international community and especially
the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council ``to support
this humanitarian and political action ... in the interest of the
African people as a whole, and for the maintenance of international
peace and security.''
   The region is supporting nearly 400,000 Liberians who fled
following the beginning of the insurgency against President Samuel
Doe began in December. Doe's forces face rebels from two factions,
one led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor and another by Prince
Johnson.

   Customs officials seized a shipload of
Iraqi crude oil this morning at Port Arthur because it violated the
trade embargo, authorities said.
   The nearly 500,000 barrels, roughly 20 million gallons, of Iraqi
crude on the Swedish-flagged vessel Thoraas were seized because the
shipment was paid for Monday in violation of the U.S. embargo on
Iraqi oil, said Donna De La Torre, a spokeswoman for the Customs
southwest regional office at Houston. The embargo began at 5 a.m.
Thursday after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Customs seized the oil from Bay Oil Co. ``based on the fact that
the Iraqi government has already been paid,'' Ms. De La Torre said.
   The ship was detained, but not seized, she added, until Customs
determines what to do with the oil aboard.
   The Thoraas brings oil into port after it is transfered from a
larger vessel, the process oil shippers call lightering. Ms. De La
Torre said the oil had been transferred from the ship Cartha
Gonova, but she didn't know its whereabouts or country of
registration.

<TEXT>
   Training courses for about 10 Iraqi air force
pilots in France have been abruptly canceled and the aviators await
the reopening of air routes before they can go home.
   The pilots, scattered around several French air force bases for
flight training or to familiarize themselves with French equipment
purchased by Iraq, were grounded as of Saturday, two days after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``They are at the end of their stay,'' a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Tuesday. ``The pilots will return to Iraq when the
air frontiers open again. Unless they don't want to.''
   Training came to a formal end for the pilots, no matter what the
stage of their individual courses, after the 12-nation European
Community adopted an oil and arms embargo against Iraq on Saturday.
   The conservative daily newspaper Le Figaro reported Tuesday that
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement ordered the pilots placed
on stand-by Friday, a day before the sanctions were adopted.
   France has trained Iraqi pilots since the 1970s to fly the
modern warplanes it sells to Baghdad, including Mirage fighters.
   The ministry refuses to reveal how many Iraqi pilots it has
trained, but Le Figaro said the number has dropped as Iraq becomes
able to instruct its own pilots.
   A former national intelligence director, Pierre Marion, said in
an interview Monday that France has sold Iraq about $5 billion
worth of arms, about one-quarter of Baghdad's arsenal.
   The arms include about 210 Mirages, as well as Exocet anti-ship
missiles that Iraq used against oil tankers in its eight-year war
with Iran, Marion said.

<HEAD>Armed Forces Chief Says Military Threat To Soviet Union Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's strategic position will be more
difficult following German unification, the chief of the Soviet
Armed Forces general staff said Tuesday.
   ``The Soviet people are interested in what policy a united
Germany will pursue in future,'' Mikhail Moiseyev told the Tass
news agency. ``Regrettably, NATO doctrines and concepts based on
the use of nuclear weapons first have not changed.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed last month that a unified
Germany could belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. His
change-of-mind came after West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
promised that a united Germany would cut its armed forces. It also
followed a NATO agreement to shift from a military to a political
alliance.
   ``We should display realism and restraint in all appraisals,''
Moiseyev said.
   Noting that the new border between NATO and the Warsaw Pact
countries will run along the Oder River, dividing Poland from what
is now East Germany, Moiseyev said:
   ``It would be premature to say today that the military danger
for the U.S.S.R. has disappeared.''
   Tass quoted him as saying his country's strategic position would
then be more difficult.
   Gorbachev said last month he would withdraw the remaining
380,000 Soviet troops from East Germany within two or three years.
Some Western experts predict they will leave even sooner.
   Kohl promised that a united Germany would reduce its combined
armed forces to 370,000. The two Germanys now have 600,000 enlisted
men, 480,000 of them in the West.

   The new president of Soviet Armenia appealed
Tuesday for its restive and armed citizens to act with cool heads
as its parliament began debating a declaration of independence.
   In the Baltic republics of Estonia and Lithuania, where
independence drives began earlier, the parliaments approved
platforms for negotiations with the Soviet Union on breaking from
Moscow.
   The Soviet Interior Ministry reported that ``extremists'' in
Armenia continue to seize arms in defiance of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's decree demanding that militants disarm and disband by
Thursday.
   Underscoring the danger from the illegal weapons, the Tass news
agency reported that a man shot and killed a military cadet on
Sunday in Armenia while seizing a submachine gun.
   Levon Ter-Petrosyan, a nationalist leader whom the parliament
elected president on Saturday, said in his address that Armenia
could handle its own problems _ a rejoinder to Kremlin threats to
send in troops to enforce order if Gorbachev's decree is ignored.
   ``We are capable in a short period of time and with our own
means of solving the complex problems relating to the republic's
domestic life and of stabilizing the existing explosive situation,
provided that external interference is excluded,'' he told
Armenia's parliament.
   ``I have grounds also to anticipate that the union (Soviet)
authorities will receive our position with understanding,'' he said.
   He urged the population ``to evaluate cool-headedly the current
state of crisis in the republic, the only way out of which is the
consolidation of the people around the idea of statehood and its
embodiment in the national parliament.''
   About 40,000 members of Armenian paramilitary units must, under
Gorbachev's decree, surrender their weapons or face forcible
confiscation by the Red Army. The Armenian parliament already has
rejected the decree as interference in the republic's internal
affairs, saying it can police itself.
   ``I call upon all the volunteers to give a pledge of allegiance
to the republic's seat of supreme authority and, forgetting
internal contradictions, to abstain from any unconsidered
operation,'' he said.
   ``I am obliged to remind you also that the people will not
forgive any adventure that endangers the fulfillment of our
statehood,'' he added in the speech, a copy of which was provided
to The Associated Press by the Armenian National Movement. Tass
also carried a report on the speech.
   Ter-Petrosyan, a leader of the Armenian National Movement, spent
six months in jail last year for organizing mass demonstrations
against Azerbaijani control of the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. More than 200 people have died in ethnic clashes
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over control of the territory,
which Azerbaijan has held since 1923.
   Tass reported that the lawmakers on Tuesday began discussing a
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.
   If Armenia adopts the resolution on independence, it would
become the fifth of the 15 Soviet republics to move toward complete
separation from the Soviet Union. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and
Georgia have already taken steps.
   The Estonian parliament on Tuesday declared that it will
negotiate with the Soviet Union with the following understandings:
that the Soviet constitution ``ceased to regulate state and social
relations in Estonia,'' that it will refuse to help draft a treaty
of union among the Soviet republics and that it will consider the
Soviet Army's presence illegal unless Estonia and Soviet
authorities draft a treaty on the issue. A report on the
parliament's actions came from the Estonian News Agency.
   The Interfax news agency, meanwhile, reported that Lithuania's
parliament approved the basic points and goals of negotiations with
the Soviet Union on independence. The action was taken at a closed
session of parliament, and no further details were released.
   Armenia's independence proposal calls for specific steps toward
achieving separation from the Soviet Union, according to legislator
Raphael Popoyan. It does not follow the example of Lithuania, which
on March 11 declared overnight independence, with the details to be
worked out later.
   Popoyan said the victory of Ter-Petrosyan, a supporter of the
independence proposal, indicated the parliament probably will
support complete separation from the Soviet Union, rather than a
less-radical declaration of sovereignty.

<HEAD>Former West Virginia Governor Reports To Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former West Virginia Gov.
Arch A. Moore Jr. reported to a federal prison camp today to begin
serving a five-year, 10-month sentence for political corruption.
   Moore, 67, entered the 786-prisoner Maxwell Air Force Base camp
near Montgomery, Ala., shortly after 1 p.m.
   He arrived with his wife, Shelley, and an unidentified man,
refusing to answer questions before entering the prison.
   Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud
and obstruction of justice.
   Prosecutors said Moore extorted $573,000 from a mine company
official, H. Paul Kizer, in return for a $2.1 million black lung
fund refund for Kizer's coal companies.
   Shortly afterward, he sought to withdraw his guilty plea to most
of the charges, but U.S. District Court Judge Walter Hoffman turned
him down last month. In addition to the five-year, 10-month
sentence, the judge fined Moore $170,000.
   Moore won't be eligible for parole for 2{ years.
   Moore, a Republican who was governor from 1969 to 1977 and again
from 1985 to 1989, became the second governor of that state to
serve a prison term. The first was Wally Barron, who was governor
from 1961 through 1965 and later spent nearly 3{ years in prison
for bribing a jury foreman.
   Moore's fate was sealed Monday when a federal appeals court
refused to continue bond pending his appeal of Hoffman's rejection
of his bid to withdraw the pleas.
   The prison generally houses white-collar convicts who, like
Moore, are considered non-violent. Among the prominent men who have
served time there are U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell and U.S.
District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada.
   In addition to Moore, federal authorities' three-year
investigation into government corruption has netted two former
state Senate presidents, three other West Virginia legislators,
three lobbyists, a former Senate aide and two former state Tax
Department workers.

   An Iraqi airways jet carrying 78 foreigners
and a number of Iraqi citizens arrived today, the first commercial
flight allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese
Embassy spokesman said.
   The mostly Japanese tourists arrived at Amman airport at 6:15
p.m. (11:15 a.m. EDT) along with 34 members of an Iraqi football
team, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity. It was not
immediately known if there were Americans on board.
   He said that the plane was due to leave Amman for an undisclosed
destination.
   The spokesman said the plane was supposed to land in Vienna, but
it was denied landing rights.
   The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted economic sanctions
that ban all trade and military ties with Iraq.
   Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim Izzedine, said earlier
today that the U.S. government had asked Jordan to facilitate the
entrance from Iraq of American diplomats and their dependents.
Izzedine said the request was made through the U.S. Embassy in
Amman.
   Thousands of Westerners have been stranded in Kuwait and Iraq
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday. They include more than 350
who were on a British Airways flight that was caught in the unrest
in Kuwait.
   A British Airways spokeswoman said today a ``substantial''
number of those passengers arrived safely in Baghdad on Monday.
Among the passengers were 28 Americans, who also turned up in a
Baghdad hotel and appear to be fine, a U.S. official said in
Washington.
   In addition, a Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day
were fleeing Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia. The
businessman, who arrived in London on a British Airways flight from
Bahrain today, said Kuwaitis and expatriates, including Westerners,
were joining convoys to escape the Iraqi forces.
   Jordan's borders with Iraq had been closed from the Iraqi side
since Thursday morning, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The ``provisional
government of free Kuwait'' set up by Iraq had threatened Sunday to
hold hostage citizens of countries imposing sanctions on it.
   A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed ``American
citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when
circumstances permit.''

   An army-supported caretaker
government assumed power Tuesday and ordered former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto and other top officials not to leave the country.
   One diplomat called it a ``constitutional coup.''
   Ms. Bhutto, dismissed by the president on Monday, spent her
first day out of office meeting with former Cabinet ministers to
chart a strategy for their party, which is now deeply divided and
demoralized.
   Ms. Bhutto, members of her government and members of the
disbanded federal legislature were ordered to remain in Pakistan,
spokesmen for the new and former governments said.
   Pakistan appeared calm after the action and troops deployed to
maintain order began returning to their barracks Monday night.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan invoked his constitutional authority
and dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government, alleging widespread
corruption, misuse of power, judicial intimidation and failure to
curb ethnic violence that has claimed more than 400 lives since May
in her home province of Sindh.
   Ms. Bhutto called the charges baseless and said she had only one
demand: ``Hold fair and free elections, on schedule, and let the
people decide.''
   The president appointed opposition leader Mustafa Jatoi as
acting prime minister, set new elections for Oct. 24 and declared a
state of emergency that gave the new government sweeping powers to
suspend all laws and individual rights.
   But many members of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party said
privately that the link between Ms. Bhutto and grass roots members
has been almost severed, largely because of her unwillingness to
compromise and allegations that senior government officials used
their positions to make huge fortunes.
   ``We simply blew it,'' one former minister said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The president's decision took Ms. Bhutto and senior officials by
surprise.
   But some opposition officials said the president starting
drafting the order two months ago after telling Ms. Bhutto to
reform her government.
   ``She has nobody to blame but herself. She had plenty of
warnings,'' said Abida Hussein, a former lawmaker and one of Ms.
Bhutto's most outspoken critics.
   According to sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
Pakistani army also had become increasingly impatient with Ms.
Bhutto's inability to find a political solution to the ethnic
violence in Sindh and her perceived meddling in military affairs.
   The sources said the army gave Ishaq Khan the green light to
dismiss the government after a meeting between army chief of staff
Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg and Ms. Bhutto failed to resolve the dispute.
   ``This was a kind of constitutional coup staged while world
attention was focused on the events of Kuwait and Iraq,'' one
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But something
had to be done. If things had continued to deteriorate, the only
ultimate solution would have been martial law.''
   The military has ruled Pakistan for 25 years of its 43-year
history.
   Members of Ms. Bhutto's former government alleged the interim
administration appointed by Ishaq Khan was considering
investigating and punishing Ms. Bhutto.
   ``They may be planning to have tribunals of accountability and
not let her stand in the next election,'' said her former minister
of information, Ahmed Saeed Awan.
   The tribunals under consideration would reportedly have the
authority to suspend participation in elections for five to seven
years.
   Critics dismissed the notion, saying the former prime minister
and her party members would be allowed to participate in an
election.
   Jatoi said the new government would initiate a process of
accountability, but added: ``Justice will be provided without
victimizing anyone.''
   Some in Ms. Bhutto's administration have compared Ishaq Khan's
move to the events of 1977, when Ms. Bhutto's father, the late
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown in a coup led by
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. He was hanged two years later for alleged
complicity in a murder plot.
   Zia ruled Pakistan until his death in a mysterious plane crash
on Aug. 17, 1988. His death cleared the way for democratic
elections that installed Ms. Bhutto as prime minister, the first
woman leader of a modern Moslem nation.

   The 28 Americans picked up in Kuwait by Iraqi
invasion troops turned up at a Baghdad hotel today, but they are
not allowed to leave the building, the State Department said.
   U.S. officials have met with some of the Americans, who were
among a group of more than 300 foreigners picked up by the Iraqis
on Monday and taken by bus to Baghdad.
   The Americans were placed in the Rashid Hotel, where 11 American
oil workers rounded up by the Iraqis in Kuwait last Thursday are
also staying, said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``The Americans in the hotel in Baghdad with whom we have met
appear to be in good shape,'' she said. ``Our understanding is that
foreigners in hotels in Baghdad who have been brought from Kuwait
are not being allowed to leave the hotels at this point.''
   The top U.S. diplomat in Iraq, Joseph Wilson, is discussing with
Iraqi authorities a plan that would allow all 500 Americans and the
50 official U.S. employees in the country to leave, she said.
   ``He made clear that we expect, once the situation is safe and
the borders are open, private Americans should be able to leave
along with any officials and their dependents,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The first commercial flight to leave Iraq since the invasion
arrived today
   in Amman, Jordan, with 78 foreigners _ most of them Japanese
tourists _ and a number of Iraqi citizens arrived today.
   It was not immediately known if there were Americans on board
the Iraqi Airways jet.
   The efforts to arrange the departure of Americans from Baghdad
seemed designed to preclude any possibility that they might be
taken hostage by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   If Americans can get out by cars or buses, they will be able to
drive to neighboring Jordan or Turkey, Ms. Tutwiler said, adding
that both countries have promised the United States they would help
Americans on their way.
   A senior Iraqi official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said today Iraq is considering allowing foreigners, including U.S.
Embassy staff and dependents, to leave by land through Jordan.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the estimated 3,000 Americans in Kuwait are
mostly unable to leave the occupied country, although some have
managed to get out. The U.S. Embassy has reported that all
Americans in the country are safe, she said.
   The State Department said the group of foreigners taken Monday
included passengers from a British Airways flight stranded in
Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion began.
   The Iraqi official said today that his country ``might be
loosening travel restrictions on foreigners and the government is
considering facilitating the departure of the foreign community for
those who wish to leave Iraq or Kuwait.''
   There are an estimated 3,000 U.S. citizens in Kuwait and 500
others in Iraq.
   ``We hold Iraq responsible for their safety,'' Ms. Tutwiler said
earlier. However, she also said, ``It's premature to call them
hostages.''
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat on Monday to demand information
about the 28 Americans taken from Kuwait and to deliver a stern
warning about their safety.
   ``It was a short and tense meeting,'' said an official afterward.
   Al-Mashat refused to talk with reporters.
   Another warning against harming Americans was delivered in
Baghdad by Wilson, the charge d'affaires in Iraq, to Saddam.
   Saddam summoned Wilson to his office _ the first contact the
United States has had with Saddam since the invasion _ and the
meeting lasted two hours, said Ms. Tutwiler.
   ``We viewed it as a very serious meeting,'' she said, indicating
the session was confrontational. The meeting took place before U.S.
officials learned of the 28 missing Americans.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed the safety of
U.S. citizens in Kuwait and Iraq with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in a 30-minute telephone conversation
Monday. Shevardnadze, whose government has announced an arms
boycott of Iraq, said he was worried about Soviet citizens in
Kuwait and Iraq, said another official.
   The ports in Kuwait and Baghdad remained closed Monday, but some
Americans managed to leave Kuwait, Ms. Tutwiler said. Another State
Department official said the number who managed to get out was
small, but declined to say how they left.

<HEAD>`The Grapes of Wrath,' Tony Winner Best Play, Closing Labor Day
Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' winner of the 1990 Tony
Award as best play, will close Labor Day weekend after a Broadway
run of less than six months, a show spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The play, based on the classic John Steinbeck novel, will have
played 188 performances and 11 previews when it ends its run Sept.
2, said Ellen Levene.
   The production from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company opened
March 22 to favorable reviews, but never became a hot ticket.
Business improved a bit in June after the show won two Tony awards
_ for best play and for Frank Galati as best director of a play.
   The show, which has a large cast of 35 performers, needs to
gross around $180,000 a week to break even and has been doing that
or a little better in recent weeks. But grosses slipped last week
to about $177,900.
   Galati adapted the sprawling novel, set during the Depression,
for the stage. It had its premiere in Chicago in September 1988 and
traveled to La Jolla, Calif., and London before opening on Broadway
in March.
   Three other Broadway shows will close the same weekend. Slated
to end their runs on Sept. 1 are ``Tru,'' Robert Morse's portrait
of author Truman Capote; the musical ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'';
and Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' the 1989 best
play Tony winner.

   A fire has damaged Poland's holiest Roman
Catholic shrine and injured four monks who tried to save
centuries-old volumes from the blaze, media and officials said
Tuesday.
   The fire at the Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa did not
endanger the jewel-robed Black Madonna, the burnished icon to which
millions of pilgrims pay homage every year, said Sister Daria at
the Roman Catholic curia in Czestochowa.
   Four monks suffered smoke inhalation while rushing through the
burning building to save books, including some illuminated
manuscripts dating to the 15th century, from the two-story library
built in 1739.
   The monks were hospitalized in stable condition, Polish
television reported.
   The fire appeared to have started in the attic and been caused
by a short circuit in the electrical system, Polish radio reported.
A commission of Warsaw specialists was established to investigate.
   The fire started late Monday and was extinguished at 8:30 a.m.
Tuesday, said the Rev. Simon Stefanowicz at the monastery.
   He said there was no significant damage to the many historical
objects housed at Jasna Gora, founded in 1382 by the hermetic
Paulite order from Hungary.
   However, firefighters had to break through the copper roof of
the building where the fire broke out. In addition to the library
and archives, the building houses a small hotel for visiting
priests and the editorial offices of a monthly monastery bulletin,
officials said.
   The building is adjacent to the chapel where the icon is housed.
But the curia said the chapel and the rest of the monastery were
sealed off and not jeopardized.
   More than 15,000 pilgrims left Warsaw on Monday on the nine-day,
174-mile walk to Czestochowa for Assumption Day on Aug. 15, a
tradition that has been maintained every year since 1711.
   Up to 170,000 pilgrims make the trip on foot, many covering the
last distance on their knees. In all, a half-million worshipers are
expected to fill the field at the monastery Aug. 15.
   Jasna Gora, or Bright Mountain, rests on a brick fortification
and houses an extensive collection of Polish historical objects,
from the weapons of kings to tear-gas grenades lobbed at Solidarity
protesters.
   The monastery provided sanctuary for the Solidarity movement
through its decade-long fight against Poland's Communist government
and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki visited Czestochowa two days
after becoming the first non-Communist government leader in the
East bloc in August 1989.
   The Black Madonna _ painted, according to legend, by St. Luke _
was brought to the monastery in 1384. Many miracles have been
attributed to the doleful painting, including a 1655 siege during
which 70 monks and 180 supporters held off nearly 4,000 soldiers
from the Protestant Swedish army and inspired the country to rise
up and throw out the invaders.

   Writer Erskine Caldwell's boyhood home has
been saved from destruction and moved to the Moreland town square,
where it will become a museum honoring the novelist.
   Caldwell, author of ``Tobacco Road,'' ``God's Little Acre'' and
at least 50 other books, was born in the house on Dec. 17, 1903,
and lived there until he was 14.
   The house was the parsonage for the White Oak Associate Reformed
Presbyterian Church, where Caldwell's father, the Rev. Ira
Sylvester Caldwell, was pastor.
   The house, estimated to have been built around 1879, was
occupied until 1960 and then was used to store hay. It stood about
2 miles from the town square in this community southwest of Atlanta.
   ``It was scheduled to be torn down and a barn built in its
place,'' said Miriam Miller, chairwoman of the committee that had
the five-room, one-story house moved.
   Mrs. Miller said Caldwell's widow, Virginia, has agreed to
donate one of her husband's typewriters and some books to the
museum.

   The Soviet Union said Tuesday it prefers political
pressure to an international military buildup to force Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait. But it took no chances, dispatching two warships to
protect Soviet commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said an
anti-submarine ship and a destroyer patrolling the Indian Ocean
were sailing toward the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the gulf.
Journalists in helicopters on Tuesday reported seeing a Soviet
destroyer nearing the strait.
   Gremitskikh said the ships were dispatched ``to ensure safety of
navigation of Soviet civilian vessels.''
   He urged caution in the naval buildup but was careful to avoid
direct criticism of the United States, which has sent even more
warships to the gulf.
   ``A buildup in the military presence and naval muscle-flexing in
such a very tense and very complex situation is not the best line
of action,'' Gremitskikh told a regular news briefing.
   The United States moved aircraft carriers into position near the
gulf. One is at the mouth of the gulf, and the other is in the
Mediterranean within striking distance of Iraq.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
told CBS on Tuesday an international naval blockade against Iraq
was ``very likely.''
   The Washington Post said the Pentagon proposed an international
blockade that would include forces from the Soviet Union.
Gremitskikh told reporters Moscow had not discussed joining such a
blockade.
   The Soviet Union ``prefers political means'' for resolving the
crisis, such as the worldwide trade embargo ordered by the U.N.
Security Council on Monday, and diplomatic intervention by other
Arab states, Gremitskikh said.
   A senior Soviet military official doubted the superpowers would
resort to force against Iraq.
   ``I think the Soviet Union and the United States will solve
this, but not by war. They will use public pressure,'' Lt. Gen.
Vladislav Lisovsky, deputy commander of the Leningrad Military
District, told reporters watching military exercises near
Leningrad. ``It's apparent that the Soviet Union and the United
States have taken the humanitarian side,'' he added.
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock met Tuesday in Moscow with Soviet
Deputy Foreign Ministry Alexander Belonogov, who has been holding
regular talks with Iraq's ambassador, Tass reported.
   The official news agency did not disclose details of the meeting
except to say it was at the American's request. The U.S. Embassy
confirmed the report but refused to elaborate.
   The Soviet Union joined the United States in condemning Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and urging a speedy withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
It also halted arms sales to Baghdad, a long-time ally.
   The Soviet Union has not said what other measures it will take
to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution ordering
worldwide sanctions against Iraq. Belonogov told the government
newspaper Izvestia that whatever action is taken, the Soviet
economy will be hurt. He did not elaborate, but the
shortage-plagued Soviet Union imports $1.6 billion worth of goods
from Iraq. It exports $428 million worth of goods to the Middle
Eastern country.
   ``By taking these measures, we cut the cooperation which we have
accumulated with Baghdad for decades,'' Belonogov said. ``But all
the same, the U.S.S.R. will unswervingly observe the resolution of
the Security Council.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said in a commentary that
the Soviet Union's decision to suspend arms supplies to its old
friend Iraq was not taken lightly.
   ``The Soviet Union sided with Iraq at its most trying times, but
it is one matter to participate in defense, and other to be
involved in piracy,'' the newspaper said.
   Belonogov said the Foreign Ministry was working on plans to
evacuate Soviets from Kuwait by air or sea.
   Lisovsky said Soviet military officers in Iraq had already left.
Almost 900 Soviets live in Kuwait, and 8,000 in Iraq, including
diplomats, businessmen, military advisers and oil workers.
   Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have asked for Soviet help in
evacuating their nationals, Belonogov said.

   President Hosni Mubarak met Tuesday
with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who was said to be seeking
support for a multinational ground force to deter Iraq from
invading Saudi Arabia.
   Cheney met for an hour with Mubarak, who earlier held separate
meetings with Iraqi and Kuwaiti leaders.
   Mubarak, who has been trying to mediate the Iraq-Kuwait crisis,
received a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein explaining
why his troops took over Kuwait on Thursday.
   Presidential sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the message ``explains the Iraqi viewpoint on the present crisis.''
It was relayed by Izzat Ibrahim, vice president and deputy chairman
of Iraq's ruling revolutionary command council.
   Ibrahim and Mubarak met for two hours. After Ibrahim left,
Cheney and Mubarak had their meeting. Cheney refused to talks to
reporters afterward.
   Pentagon sources in Washington said Cheney was seeking approval
from Mubarak to move the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower, with its
complement of sophisticated aircraft, through the Suez Canal. From
there, it could head toward the Persian Gulf.
   Cheney also was seeking the cooperation of Middle East nations
to station a multinational ground force in Saudi Arabia to contain
further Iraqi aggression, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Earlier in the day, the Middle East News Agency said Mubarak had
spoken on the phone with President Bush to discuss the situation in
Kuwait.
   Cheney stopped over on his way home from Saudi Arabia, where he
conferred Monday with Saudi officials about bolstering the U.S.
presence there in the event of an Iraqi attack on the oil-rich
kingdom.
   Penatagon sources said that although two U.S. aircraft carriers
were within range to carry out air strikes in the Persian Gulf or
against Iraqi sites, a major air strike would require flying over
or landing rights from friendly nations in the region.
   Although Iraqi officials repeatedly have said they would not
attack Saudi Arabia, residents have reported increased military
activity in the kingdom, especially near the Kuwaiti border where
Iraqi troops have been sighted strenthening their positions.
   Cheney was accompanied by Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the U.S.
Middle East force known as the Central Command; Richard Gates,
deputy national security adviser; and Paul Wolowitz, deputy defense
secretary.
   Ibrahim was the first Iraqi official to meet with Mubarak since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   He was also the head of the delegation that held talks with
Kuwaiti officials Aug. 1 in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to resolve their
differences over oil and land.
   The talks failed, and less than 24 hours later, Iraq invaded
Kuwait.

   Federal scientists didn't really lose a
quarter-million-dollar underwater camera used to map the ocean
floor.
   They know exactly where it is _ 200 miles off the Oregon Coast
and more than a mile straight down.
   The crew of a submersible will try to find and hook a cable to
the one-ton camera system, a task sort of like standing atop a
skyscraper and trying to drop a rope into an open manhole, said
Steve Hammond of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The $250,000 package was suspended from the 303-foot NOAA ship
Discoverer last week when its three-quarter-inch cable snapped. The
camera system includes a low-light video camera, a 35mm still
camera, and various temperature, conductivity and depth sensors,
all in sealed containers.
   The Alvin will try to retrieve the camera later this month,
Hammond said from his office at the Hatfield Marine Science Center.
   The Alvin's crew of three will attempt to approach the camera
with a hook and cable so a surface ship can reel it in. However, if
the camera is snarled in its broken cable, they may not able to get
close enough to attach the hook, Hammond said.
   The Alvin is too small to raise the camera.

   Andrew Young, struggling to keep alive his hopes of being
Georgia's first black governor, needed an upset Tuesday in his
Democratic runoff against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller.
   In Kansas, first-term Gov. Mike Hayden fought for survival in a
Republican primary as his chief opponent, real estate executive
Nestor Weigand Jr., tried to capitalize on voter anger over higher
property taxes. On the Democratic side, former Gov. John Carlin was
favored to win the first round of a comeback bid.
   Two other states also held primaries. Michigan Republicans
picked opponents for two Democratic incumbents seeking third terms
_ Gov. James Blanchard and Sen. Carl Levin. Polls showed Rep. Bill
Schuette a heavy favorite over lawyer Clark Durant for the right to
challenge Levin. State Sen. John Engler was expected to trounce
General Motors engineer John Lauve and earn a shot at Blanchard.
   And in Missouri, Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority
leader, sought the Democratic nomination for an eighth term against
Nicholas F. Clement, a newspaper carrier who is a follower of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman and U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, finished 12 percentage points behind Miller
in the primary July 17. Two polls released last week showed him
trailing by as much as 20 points heading into the runoff.
   That showing came in spite of an aggressive runoff strategy in
which Young suggested that Miller, a white moderate who has been
lieutenant governor for 16 years, pushed banking legislation that
helped his friends.
   Miller, 58, denied the charge and kept plugging away at the
major themes of his campaign, including support for a state lottery.
   Young, also 58, conceded that the polls showed he would need a
``miracle'' to win, but added, ``Pollsters have never known what
they're talking about.''
   The winner of the runoff faces Republican Johnny Isakson in
November. Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris was barred by law from
seeking a third consecutive term.
   In Kansas, Hayden, 46, had five opponents for the GOP
nomination, but polls indicated the one with the best shot at
ousting him was Weigand, a Wichita businessman with no political
experience.
   Weigand, 51, hit hard at Hayden's role in property reappraisal
and implementing a new classification system that many blamed for
big property tax increases in 1989. The changes were felt most by
medium and small businesses.
   Carlin, who served two terms in 1979-87, was challenged on the
Democratic side by longtime state Treasurer Joan Finney and
minister Fred Phelps.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum had token opposition from political unknown
Gregory Walstrom in her bid for the GOP nomination to a third term.
The Democratic Senate ballot listed political newcomer Dick
Williams of Wichita and former Rep. Bill Roy, who tried too late to
remove his name.

   Georgia's runoff campaign took a negative turn when Young,
shocked by a weaker-than-expected showing among black voters in the
primary, adopted a more aggressive strategy for the rematch.
   He unleashed a series of attacks questioning Miller's ties to
the banking industry and broadcast the first negative ad of the
campaign season in Georgia _ a spot accusing Miller of changing
positions on issues for political expediency. The ad resurrected
the appellation hung on Miller in a campaign 10 years ago _
``Zig-Zag Zell.''
   Critics said Young's effort to woo white voters during the
primary election, and his failure to include more black elected
officials in his campaign, left some black voters feeling ignored.
   The runoff _ required because no candidate won a majority in the
primary _ has been challenged in court as discriminatory against
blacks, who make up about 28 percent of Georgia's voters.
   In Kansas, Weigand gained quick exposure by spending his own
money lavishly in a 10-week television blitz.
   ``What Nestor brought to this campaign is a million dollars and
a million yard signs,'' Hayden said Monday. ``He has shown that
he's weak on the issues and he really doesn't know much about
government.''
   Weigand said voters were ``tired of professional politicians who
have created problems such as our property tax mess. They want
control of their government back, and they don't want politicians
telling them one thing and doing another.''
   The last Kansas governor to be denied renomination was Fred
Hall, who lost the Republican primary in 1956.
   In Michigan, Schuette virtually ignored Durant, attacking Levin
as too liberal on such issues as opposition to the death penalty.
Republicans have not won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since
1972.
   Similarly, Engler concentrated his fire on Blanchard, accusing
him of using public relations gimmicks to put a shiny veneer over
deep problems in Michigan's economy and state budget.
   Blanchard responded that he wiped out the $1.7 billion budget
deficit he inherited after he was elected in 1982 and had moved to
diversify the state's economy, improve education, and fight crime
with new prison construction.

   Two engines of a Boeing 747 charter jet burst into
flames Tuesday shortly after the plane landed at Gatwick Airport
from Montreal, airport authorities said.
   The 439 passengers and crew on Nationair Flight NXA124 were
evacuated down emergency chutes and 24 passengers suffered minor
injuries, airport and ambulance authorities said.
   ``They all had minor injuries _ sprained ankles, bruises, cuts _
and they were all given first aid at the airport. There were no
broken limbs,'' the company said.
   Two firemen overcome by smoke and fumes were treated at East
Surrey Hospital and later discharged, the Surrey Ambulance
Authority said.
   The two engines caught fire as the plane turned off the runway
toward a parking bay at 11:12 a.m., said a spokeswoman for Gatwick
airport. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fire engines raced down the runway and extinguished the blaze.
   The emergency closed part of Gatwick's runway for 40 minutes,
preventing the takeoff of wide-bodied jets. Four flights were
diverted to Heathrow Airport, the spokeswoman said.
   The charter flight originated at Mirabel airport, outside of
Montreal.
   The jet was towed to a hanger where damage was being assessed,
the spokeswoman said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.

   Complying with U.N.-ordered sanctions,
Turkey on Tuesday halted tankers from loading Iraqi oil from Iraq's
last operating pipeline through the country.
   The move effectively cut off the outlet for more than half of
Iraqi's crude exports.
   The government also announced it was freezing all Iraqi and
Kuwaiti assets, stopping all imports from those countries and
limiting exports to food and medicine.
   Kuwaiti assets in Turkey total about $25 million, the Foreign
Ministry said. No figure was available for Iraqi assets.
   In imposing the measures, Turkey joined an international
campaign intended to pressure Iraq to withdraw its occupying forces
from Kuwait.
   Embargoes of Iraqi products, including oil, had already forced
Iraq on Monday to close one of its two pipelines that traverse
Turkey and carry oil to a terminal on the Mediterranean. It reduced
the capacity of the second pipeline by 30 percent.
   The twin pipelines had been carrying about 1.6 million barrels a
day, more than half Iraq's total oil exports of 3 million barrels
daily.
   Mehmet Kececiler, Turkish minister in charge of oil affairs,
said Iraq could continue to pump crude oil through the second
pipeline until the storage tanks at the end terminal were filled.
The Iraqis will be forced to stop pumping once the tanks are
filled, a process expected to take about six days, he said.
   ``Otherwise this expensive stuff would just float around,'' the
minister said. A tanker from Morocco arrived at the terminal
Tuesday but was turned back, Kececiler said.
   The United States, Japan and Economic Community imposed
embargoes on Iraqi oil in the past week. Turkey refused to do so
until the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Monday
supporting global sanctions against Iraq.
   The minister said the Security Council vote was binding on all
member states. ``This is why we took this decision. We were not
pressured by anyone,'' he said.
   Turkey stands to suffer substantial economic losses by complying
with the sanctions. Iraq owes Turkey $741 million and pays off part
of its debt with oil.
   Foreign ministry officials said Turkish contractors have
construction equipment worth $40 million in Iraq and that total
contracts, which are likely to be halted, amount to $750 million.

<HEAD>Former West Virginia Governor Reports To Federal Prison Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL POOVEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former West Virginia Gov. Arch A. Moore
Jr. entered a federal prison camp Tuesday to serve a 70-month
sentence for political corruption.
   Moore, 67, arrived at the barracks-style camp at Maxwell Air
Force Base with his wife and another man seven minutes after his
noon reporting deadline. He refused to answer questions from
reporters.
   Prison camp spokesman James E. Burrell said Moore would first go
through an orientation before getting a job assignment.
   Moore, the only West Virginia governor to serve three four-year
terms, pleaded guilty May 8 to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud and
obstruction of justice.
   Moore sought to withdraw his guilty plea to four of the charges,
but U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman refused July 8. The next day
he sentenced Moore to prison and fined him $170,000, which Moore
has since paid.
   On Monday, a federal appeals court refused to continue bond
pending his appeal of Hoffman's ruling.
   The federal prison camp, housing 786 inmates, has no walls or
barbed wire fences, but inmates follow a regimented schedule and
get up at 5:30 a.m. daily.
   ``It is not a country club,'' Burrell said. ``Those are not
inmates up there playing golf.''
   However, the camp is next to a golf course.
   The prison generally houses white-collar convicts who, like
Moore, are considered nonviolent. It has housed a number of
prominent prisoners, including former U.S. Attorney General John
Mitchell in 1977 and U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada
in 1986. Former Tennessee Gov. Ray Blanton went to the prison camp
in 1984.
   In addition to Moore, a three-year federal investigation into
government corruption in West Virginia netted two former state
Senate presidents, three other legislators, three lobbyists, a
former Senate aide and two former state Tax Department workers.
   Moore, a Republican who was governor from 1969 to 1977 and again
from 1985 to 1989, is the second West Virginia governor to serve a
prison term. The first was W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, governor from
1961 through 1965, who later spent nearly 3{ years in prison for
bribing a jury foreman.

   Two U.S. carrier battle groups were already on station in the
region _ the USS Independence and its 14 escorts in the Arabian Sea
at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and the force led by the USS
Eisenhower in the eastern Mediterranean.
   ``If something happens, these boys can handle it,'' said a
confident Wade Andrews as the Saratoga, with his seaman son aboard,
cruised into the Atlantic off Florida.
   Defense Secretary Cheney met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to seek Egyptian permission for the Eisenhower to pass
through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea, to get closer to the
Gulf flashpoints, Pentagon sources said.
   A handful of British and French navy vessels, possible partners
in a U.S.-led blockade, were also in the Gulf region. A Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman said a Soviet anti-submarine ship and
destroyer were dispatched from the Indian Ocean toward the Straits
of Hormuz, but only to ``ensure safety of navigation of Soviet
civilian vessels.''
   The Pentagon sources said Cheney also intended to sound out
Mubarak on the possibility of Egyptian and other Arab participation
in a multinational ground force to be stationed in Saudi Arabia as
a ``trip wire,'' guarding against any aggression by the Iraqi war
machine against that oil kingdom.
   In Kuwait, occupied by tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers,
living conditions were growing more difficult, said a Kuwaiti
businessman who fled his homeland through the desert backcountry to
Saudi Arabia. ``Some Iraqi troops are looting private houses and
shops,'' he said.
   The proxy government installed by Iraq in Kuwait declared
Tuesday it was abolishing the previous royal government system _
``the corrupt satellite regime installed by colonialism'' _ and
replacing it with a republic.
   New concerns focused on the Americans and other Westerners
stranded in Kuwait and Iraq. Kuwait's ambassador to London
suggested they might become hostages. ``Maybe he (Saddam) will
behave like anyone who hijacks a plane,'' he said.
   The U.S. State Department reported that 28 Americans among more
than 300 foreigners picked up at Kuwait hotels by Iraqi troops on
Monday had turned up at a Baghdad hotel. But they were not allowed
to leave the building.
   Some 3,000 Americans were residing in Kuwait before the
invasion, and 500 in Iraq. American diplomats in Baghdad were
discussing a plan with Iraqi authorities that would allow all
Americans to leave Iraq, the State Department said.
   Iraqi and Jordanian officials in Jordan's capital, Amman, said
foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq might be allowed to leave via an
overland route to Jordan. The first commercial flight to depart
Iraq since the invasion arrived Tuesday in Jordan with 78
foreigners, mostly Japanese tourists.

   The risk-laden Iraq standoff is giving
President Bush a respite from partisan attacks on domestic issues
and the potential for a major foreign policy trophy, Republican
strategists say.
   But Democrats, who have silenced their attacks to support Bush
for now, contend the latest Middle East crisis and its economic
repercussions will eventually hurt the president at home.
   Analysts agree that Bush is at a crucial, defining point of his
presidency, facing a number of major challenges with the potential
for dramatic and possibly devastating effects on an economy already
teetering on recession and, now, the first significant post-Cold
War military crisis.
   ``No doubt, he's got his hands full more than he has at any
other time in his presidency,'' said GOP consultant Charles Black,
who is helping direct the Republican Party in the absence of ailing
Chairman Lee Atwater.
   ``This is the type of foreign crisis that is very quickly
domesticated in terms of U.S. politics,'' said Stephen Hess of the
Brookings Institution. ``Bush is the one who has said, `Watch how I
handle my first real crisis,' and now he's got one.''
   The Iraqi crisis presents daunting risks to the U.S. economy and
the stability of the Middle East, Hess said. But he said Iraq's
Saddam Hussein ``is a villain we love to hate,'' which works in
Bush's favor.
   Key GOP strategists acknowledged that the Iraqi crisis is
unusual because of its direct impact on oil prices and therefore on
the U.S. economy _ the primary factor in a president's peacetime
political fortunes.
   Because of that linkage and the likelihood of higher oil prices
_ at least in the short term, regardless of whether Iraq withdraws
from Kuwait _ Democratic strategists believe the economy, and Bush,
will suffer.
   ``If he walks away, he isn't showing any backbone. And if he
takes on Iraq, by definition he impacts on the price of energy,
badly, which means a burden on the economy that almost surely will
bring recession,'' said Democratic consultant Bob Beckel. ``A
president's standing with the people depends on their pocketbooks
and how they feel about the economy.''
   Even before the Iraqi invasion last Thursday, which immediately
produced higher gas prices and talk of lines at the pumps, there
were growing signs of consumer unease with the economy.
   That unease has been mirrored in financial markets, wary because
mounting data show a virtually idle economy and volatile because of
Bush's tax reversal, stalled deficit-reduction negotiations,
uncertainty over inflation and the rising cost of the savings and
loan bailout.
   Add the Iraqi crisis to that mix of domestic challenges
confronting Bush and Democrats see ``the irony of ironies'' _ a
Republican president facing economic problems resembling those of
Jimmy Carter; the same problems that Bush and Ronald Reagan often
lumped together as symptoms of dreaded Carter-era ``malaise.''
   ``There are a lot of ducks to shoot out there, and for a change
they're Republican ducks,'' said Beckel.
   Black and Bush pollster Bob Teeter argued that Americans will
not blame Bush for economic hardships resulting from his hard line
against Iraq but will credit him for bold leadership if Iraq backs
down.
   ``The public will understand that higher oil prices are not
George Bush's fault,'' said Teeter. ``There's as much opportunity
here as there is risk.''
   Said Black: ``The end result of this will be a reinforcing of
the view that George Bush is the most qualified president we have
had on foreign policy in modern times.'' He also predicted Bush
will ``land on his feet'' in handling the related budgetary issues,
without any lasting economic harm.
   Democratic hopes for partisan gain seem pinned on a recession
and the belief that Bush's foreign policy credentials won't matter
much to voters if the economy takes a dive.
   ``For now, Democrats and for that matter I think everyone will
be supportive of the president,'' said Democratic pollster Harrison
Hickman.
   But Hickman said polls show ``people preoccupied with domestic
problems and starting to stick'' some of the blame on Bush. The
Iraqi crisis, said Hickman, ``won't negate that, but it buys him
some time because it diverts attention.''

   Jewish mobs on Tuesday attacked Arabs to avenge
the slaying of two Israeli teen-agers believed killed by
Palestinians. Thousands of mourners at the youths' funeral chanted
``Death to the Arabs!''
   Thirteen people, including two Pakistani tourists, were hurt in
one stone-throwing attack, police said.
   Police arrested 22 Jewish youths who were among a crowd of about
100 that moved toward Arab east Jerusalem, police spokesman Uzi
Sandori said.
   Early Tuesday, a Palestinian woman was fatally shot as she rode
past a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. Police said
they suspected Jewish vigilantes.
   Also Tuesday, Arab reporters said the body of a Palestinian
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities was found in a
West Bank village. The army command confirmed the death.
   Thousands of Israelis attended the funeral of 18-year-old Ronen
Karamani and 17-year-old Lior Tubul.
   Religious Affairs Minister Avner Shaki, speaking to the crowd,
promised the government ``will spare no efforts to capture these
killers.'' But he was shouted down as thousands of mourners began
chanting ``Death to the Arabs!'' Others in the crowd demanded that
the killers be hanged.
   Mourners sporadically broke out of the funeral convoy of cars
and pedestrians to attack Arabs. The city's entrance was briefly
blocked. Near the cemetery, a group of about 100 ultra-Orthodox
Jews stopped cars, demanding the drivers show their identity cards.
   Many Arabs stayed off their jobs in Jerusalem after riots Monday
in which some 20 to 30 Palestinians were reported injured.
   One riot Tuesday broke out after the funeral near Karamani's
home, which is close to the Arab village of Beit Tsafafa near
Jerusalem.
   Police said some 100 Arabs stormed out of the village, shouting
``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is Great!'' and hurling stones at Jewish
houses and cars. Dozens of Jews met them with a barrage of stones,
and police forced the Arabs back into their village. There were no
immediate reports of injuries.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 50 masked Israeli teen-agers walking to
the funeral went on a rampage in downtown Jerusalem, chanting
``Death to the Arabs!'' and overturning four Arab-owned cars. One
driver was hit in the head by a stone, Israel army radio said.
   ``We want to make a Jewish intefadeh!'' one youth shouted, using
the Arab term for the 31-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Dozens of other attacks were reported in Jerusalem, intensifying
after dark when the funeral was over.
   In an unsigned leaflet Tuesday, Palestinian leaders condemned
the ``killing of innocents on both sides,'' but blamed the violence
on the Israeli occupation and the lack of progress in peace efforts.
   The two slain youths, who apparently were seized by Palestinian
militants while hitchhiking to a West Bank settlement Saturday,
were found Monday after a two-day search.
   In an apparently related development, a Palestinian woman was
fatally shot Tuesday morning as she rode in a car past Kiryat Arba,
a Jewish West Bank settlement.
   Police spokesman Danny Brinker said that officials suspect the
woman, 27-year-old Aziza Salem Jaber, was slain by settlers in
revenge for the killing of the two youths.
   Mrs. Jaber's death would bring to 726 the number of Palestinians
slain by Israelis in the uprising. Another 246 Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating
with Israel. Forty-seven Israelis have died.

   Pop singer Madonna has made another record.
   The telecast of the final concert Sunday of her ``Blonde
Ambition'' tour was the most-watched entertainment special in HBO's
18-year history, the cable company said Tuesday.
   The two-hour concert, ``Madonna _ Live!,'' was shown in the
United States on a tape-delay basis because of the time difference
in Nice, France, where she performed.
   The program had a 21.5 rating, meaning it was seen in more than
4.3 million households that pay extra each month for the HBO
service. HBO serves 20.3 million households, according to Nielsen
estimates.

retired General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith say goodbye to
hundreds of friends at an opulent bash featuring smoked duck and
$120-a-bottle champagne.
   ``It was one of the most elegant functions like that that I've
ever attended, and I've been to quite a few,'' said David Cole, a
University of Michigan official and son of the late Edward Cole,
former president of GM.
   ``I would have traded my salary for what it would have cost to
put that on,'' Cole said. ``I'm sure it was an expensive
proposition.''
   Sunday's get-together became known as ``the $5 million party.''
GM officials said that figure was ``ridiculous,'' but declined to
say how much it cost.
   ``This is the usual party we have for retiring top executives,''
said GM spokesman Jim Crellin.
   There were 326 people on the guest list, including seven of
Forbes magazine's 400 richest people in America. No one from Ford
Motor Co. nor Chrysler Corp. was there.
   The guests were entertained by Lawrence and Gorme, backed by the
Johnny Trudell Orchestra.

   Actor Ricardo Montalban, who played the
genial host of televison's ``Fantasy Island,'' sued Columbia
Pictures on Tuesday for $10 million-plus, claiming the studio
didn't pay a promised 5 percent in profits.
   The Superior Court lawsuit, which seeks $10 million in punitive
damages in addition to the profits, claims the 1977-1983 series on
ABC earned more than $100 million and was one of the most
successful in TV history.
   The lawsuit charges that Columbia Pictures Television and
Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. manipulated accounting practices
to avoid paying Montalban a portion of the profits.
   The lawsuit said Montalban was unaware of the alleged accounting
practices until he got a distribution statement from the studio in
1987 showing ``large and unwarranted interest charges on the cost
of production and other items.''
   The lawsuit said the studio denies the show ever turned a profit.
   The studio declined to comment on the lawsuit.
   ``We are not aware of any suit, but in any event it is not our
policy to comment on pending litigation,'' said Don DeMesquita, a
spokesman at Columbia Pictures Television.

   A business group asked the Postal Service
Tuesday to investigate whether postmasters violated lobbying rules
by sending hundreds of letters defending the agency's performance
and proposed postage rate hike.
   About one-third of the letters were on Postal Service stationery
and were mailed in envelopes marked ``Official Business,''
according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The chamber, which was the recipient of the letters, requested
an investigation by the Postal Inspection Service, which protects
postal funds and property and conducts audits.
   ``We believe this matter must be investigated for two reasons,''
chamber President Richard L. Lesher said in a letter released
Tuesday to postal inspector Mark Grey of the agency's Central
Division.
   ``First, postmasters may be violating lobbying restrictions
contained in (federal law). Second, we believe this is an improper
use of the Postal Service's time, money and resources,'' Lesher
said.
   The Postal Service says the letters were needed to refute a
chamber-published brochure against the proposed new 30-cent stamp.
   Titled ``Cancel This Stamp,'' the brochure invited the chamber's
member businesses to battle the rate increase and ``join the fight
against waste in the Postal Service.''
   The brochure contained ``misinformation,'' Jim Stordahl,
regional Postal Service spokesman, said Tuesday.
   ``Postmasters are not lobbying. Postmasters are setting the
record straight with the facts,'' Stordahl said.
   ``Postal employees are no less entitled to seek accurate
treatment of information than is the chamber to protest,'' he said.
``Using official mail for this purpose is legitimate.''

<TEXT>
   Economist Cesar Gaviria was sworn in
Tuesday as president of Colombia and vowed to wage an unrelenting
war ``without concessions'' against his country's drug traffickers.
   In remarks prepared for delivery, the new president proposed
setting up an international criminal court to try drug traffickers,
who he said were guilty of ``crimes against humanity.''
   Gaviria was sworn in at 4:22 p.m. EDT.
   Despite a cease-fire purportedly declared by drug traffickers
last month, security was tight for the inauguration ceremonies,
which were attended by 88 foreign delegations. The United States
was represented by Vice President Dan Quayle, who arrived Tuesday
morning.
   Four armored U.S. Blackhawk helicopters equipped with missiles
accompanied Quayle's helicopter from the airport to an army base.
   Gaviria, 43, who was elected in May to a four-year term to
replace President Virgilio Barco, inherits a nation weary of its
fight with terrorists and drug traffickers and looking for an end
to the violence.
   Barco, who was prohibitied by the constitution from running
again, received international praise for launching the government's
war against drug traffickers one year ago. Barco will reportedly
become Colombia's next ambassador to Britain
   Gaviria vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels.
   ``Drug trafficking is the main threat against our democracy. We
will fight it without concessions,'' he said, according to a text
of his inauguration speech made available to reporters.
   But he said Colombia cannot win the fight alone, and must
receive help from the United States and Western Europe.
   He said Colombia is not a wealthy country, and called on the
major industrialized to lower their trade barriers to help Colombia
finance the drug war.
   ``It's not direct economic aid, or military assistance we need
most. It's fair treatment. It's free trade,'' Gaviria said.
   He also said the United States and other countries must do more
to cut consumption of cocaine.
   ``No success is possible if the consuming countries do not
achieve a substantial reduction in demand,'' he said.
   Of the major candidates, Gaviria took the strongest stand in
support of a continued hard line against the Medellin and Cali
cocaine cartels, which are believed to supply 80 percent of the
cocaine reaching the United States. He supports continued
extradition of drug suspects to the United States.
   Gaviria became the candidate of the governing Liberal Party
after the first candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was shot to
death by drug lords in August 1989, sparking the government
crackdown.
   Since then, police have blamed drug traffickers for exploding
about 300 bombs throughout Colombia and killing about 500 people.
   At 43, the demure Gaviria is Colombia's youngest president. A
former finance minister from the Liberal Party, he said repeatedly
that achieving peace and fighting drug terrorism would be
priorities.
   Gaviria also supports economic, not military strength, to fight
the drug scourge. Observers expect him to ask for increased
monetary aid from developed countries, particularly the United
States.
   Gaviria has said another way to solve Colombia's problems is to
increase political participation of the left and other minority
parties.
   In naming his Cabinet on Monday, he appeared to be doing just
that.
   The new ministers include five members of opposition parties,
including the M-19, a former leftist guerrilla group that signed a
peace treaty with the government in March.
   The M-19's Antonio Navarro became the first former guerrilla to
occupy a Cabinet post in Colombia. He is the minister of health.
   About 20,000 soldiers, presidential guards and police officers
patrolled the streets of Bogota, while army and police helicopter
gunships circled above the city to provide protection during the
inauguration.
   Anti-aircraft guns were on hills overlooking the presidential
palace. Army snipers stood on buildings throughout the downtown
area and especially around the palace, site of the inauguration.
   Troops at army roadblocks stopped and searched vehicles. Some
major thoroughfares were closed.
   The Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador said the blood types of
visiting dignitaries and heads of state had been noted to ensure
ample blood supplies if needed.

<HEAD>Study: Minnesota Ties With Utah As America's Healthiest State</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Healthy States-List, AM-Healthy States-Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota and Utah tied as the healthiest
states in the nation while Alaska was rated the least healthy in a
study by Northwestern National Life Health Insurance Co.
   Utah, which had the No. 1 ranking to itself in last year's
Northwestern National study, benefits from ``strong lifestyle
activities,'' according to a report issued Tuesday. Mormon
traditions that dominate Utah life discourage smoking and other
unhealthy habits.
   The study, which uses data from government agencies and health
organizations, was based on 17 statistical measures of health such
as smoking, traffic death rates and mortality indexes.
   Utah was No. 1 for low prevalence of smoking and cancer rates.
It also ranked in the 10 best for violent crime rate, which was
five times less than the lowest-ranked Florida. Favorable access to
health care and above-average mortality figures also strengthened
its standing.
   Minnesota had the nation's lowest motor vehicle death rate per
100,000 miles driven, the 16th lowest violent crime rate and the
19th lowest smoking rate.
   The state was deemed sixth best in providing good access to
medical care and it tied with Utah for the third lowest overall
mortality rate. Minnesota's infant mortality rate was the 10th
lowest.
   Minnesota ranked third best for having relatively low disease
rates. That index included cancer, heart disease and major
infectious diseases such as AIDS.
   Contributing factors to Alaska's 50th overall ranking were a
high incidence of major infectious diseases and poor access to
health care, particularly primary care, the study said. But with
the exception of high levels of smoking, Alaskans seem to have
relatively health lifestyles.
   Overall scores ranked New Hampshire third and Hawaii fourth.
Hawaiians had the longest life expectancy at birth with Minnesotans
the second longest, based on federal studies using 1980 data.
   Fredric Sattler, vice president at the Minneapolis-based
Northwestern National, acknowledged that some people might be
suspicious that Minnesota came out on top in a study conducted by a
Minnesota company. But he defended the findings.
   ``We didn't know what we'd find until we ran the numbers,'' he
said.
   The top 11 states were very close, Sattler added.
   ``I'm a bit surprised Minnesota tied for No. 1, but not
shocked,'' said Paul Gunderson, chief of health statistics at the
Minnesota Department of Health. ``I would have expected us to be in
the top six. Minnesotans can feel very good about this, but there
certainly is space for improvements''
   Minnesotans scored in the bottom half of the national ranking in
only one of the 17 categories: Acute-illness visits to the doctor.
While Minnesota had the 41st highest rate of such visits, the
report noted that the difference between the highest-ranked and
lowest-ranked states was small.
   Sattler said a key aim of the study is to show where
improvements can be made.

   Marlon Brando's son pleaded innocent
Tuesday to murdering his sister's lover and his lawyer asked to
lower Christian Brando's $10 million bail.
   ``We are going to ask that Christian not be singled out and
treated differently than anyone else would be in a similar
situation,'' said attorney Robert L. Shapiro.
   An average prisoner in such a case would post between $50,000
and $100,000, he said.
   Superior Court Judge David Perez said he would consider the bail
proposal at a hearing Thursday.
   Shapiro made the move to win freedom for his client after the
32-year-old Brando answered ``yes'' to a number of questions
concerning his innocent plea to charges of first degree murder and
possession of a machine gun.
   His case was moved to Superior Court after a Municipal Court
judge found there was sufficient evidence to hold him for trial.
   The courtroom was jammed with spectators, friends of Brando,
reporters and even tourists who wandered in from the beach hoping
to get a glimpse of the defendant's famous father. But Marlon
Brando, who has attended several previous hearings, didn't show.
   Prosecutors argued previously for no bail, saying if Brando is
freed he may attempt to flee the country. Two weeks ago, another
judge set the $10 million bail, taking into consideration his
father's vast wealth.
   As a condition of the bail, the judge required that Brando
surrender his passport but Brando maintains it was lost during a
move from an apartment into his father's house.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop noted then that Brando's
20-year-old half-sister, Cheyenne Brando, recently went to Tahiti.
Officials say she is unwilling to return to testify at her
brother's trial.
   Brando is accused of killing Miss Brando's 26-year-old Tahitian
lover, Dag Drollet, during an argument May 16 at the Brando estate.
Miss Brando gave birth June 30 in Tahiti to Drollet's son.
   Shapiro maintains that Christian Brando was drunk and the
shooting was an accident that occurred when he and Drollet fought
over a gun. He indicated Tuesday that would continue to be the
defense.

   President Bush today ordered the deployment of
U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia to help protect the oil-rich kingdom
from Iraq, a Pentagon source said.
   A separate source said the deployment would be part of a
multi-national force.
   The disclosure came as the White House said there was an
``imminent threat to Saudi Arabia,'' but would not confirm any
military maneuvers. ``The U.S. government is prepared for
eventualities and doing planning as appropriate,'' said spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   One report said some U.S. troops had been on the ground in Saudi
Arabia for several hours. The United States was counting on
Egyptian troops to join the international group aiding Saudi
defense.
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
expected Army troops from several points to be readied for movement
to the Middle East, including airborne units from Ft. Bragg, N.C.,
as well as troops from Fort Stewart, Ga. and Fort Campbell, Ky.
There was no immediate word on the size of the deployment.
   The airborne divisions will be used to secure air bases, so that
other troops, aircraft and equipment can be sent in later, sources
said.
   Aside from possible deployment of troops, the administration was
exploring the possibility of an international blockade to choke off
trade in and out of Iraq in an effort to reverse its invasion of
Kuwait.
   One key source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Saudis had responded positively to Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney's request that a multi-national military force _ including
Americans _ be allowed into Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush twice ducked reporters' questions about the
crisis in the Persian Gulf that has resulted in a swift run-up in
domestic gasoline prices. ``Not going to take any questions today,
thanks,'' he said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was wrapping up talks in Egypt
that sources said focused on a coordinated military response to the
Persian Gulf crisis, including the possibility of a multi-national
ground force in Saudi Arabia as a ``trip wire'' against further
Iraqi military moves.
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
Cheney was seeking approval to move the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower _ with its complement of sophisticated aircraft _
through the Suez Canal. Cheney, who stopped earlier in Saudi
Arabia, was expected back in Washington on Wednesday.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Bush had told his Cabinet
earlier in the day ``that he views the Iraqi troops lined up in
Kuwait facing Saudi Arabia as a threat to the United States
security interests.
   ``That has been our message to Saudi Arabia and we believe that
they understand that.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said an international naval blockade is ``very likely unless the
Iraqis back off.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, already planning a trip to Turkey on
Wednesday, would go to NATO headquarters in Brussels on Friday to
meet with allied foreign ministers.
   ``What is going on there affects the entire free world and it is
appropriate NATO meet to discuss the overall implications,'' she
said.
   The international campaign to implement a United Nations-backed
trade embargo against Saddam gained ground when Turkey announced it
had stopped tankers from loading Iraqi oil from the last operating
pipeline through its country.
   But the Soviets urged caution: ``A buildup in the military
presence and naval muscle-flexing in such a very tense and very
complex situation is not the best line of action,'' a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said in Moscow.
   The Bush administration said it would scrutinize the increase in
gasoline prices at home since the Iraqi invasion, and three
congressional committees conducted hearings on the topic.
   ``Saddam Hussein might not be the only greedy person in this
picture,'' said Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind.
   Bush, who called Monday for ``full and total implementation'' of
the United Nations-backed trade embargo, went to CIA headquarters
later in the day for briefings on the Middle East and other
matters. He again refused to respond to questions from reporters.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said ``this
blockade talk is premature'' and that the administration was
committed to carrying out the trade embargo approved Monday.
   ``We expect them to work,'' Fitzwater said about the U.N.
sanctions.
   The competing congressional hearings seemed designed to gain
media attention as well as explore the increase in gasoline prices.
   Energy Department official John Easton told one session that oil
supplies are at the highest level in nine years, and rebuffed
suggestions that the administration tap the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve in an attempt to bring down prices.
   As Iraq announced a 100,000-troop increase in its
1-million-member armed forces, the U.S. military moved aircraft
carriers into position outside the Persian Gulf.
   Carriers are outfitted with a range of F-A18 Hornet jet
fighters, F-14 Tomcat attack aircraft and A-6E Intruder bombers,
including specially outfitted KA-6D jets to handle aerial refueling
missions.
   Diplomatic contacts continued between Washington and Baghdad.
U.S. officials were discussing with Iraq a plan to allow the
departure of some of the estimated 500 Americans stranded in
Baghdad, including some of the 50 Americans at the U.S. Embassy.
   The Washington Post quoted an unidentified administration
official as saying Saddam warned the U.S. charge d'affaires, Joseph
Wilson, that he wouldattack Saudi Arabia if his pipelines through
that country are closed.
   But State Department sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, denied the published report.
   Fitzwater would not give details of Wilson's talks with Saddam
or confirm that the Iraqi ruler had delivered such a warning.
   Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, said today that a naval blockade of
Iraq is ``very likely unless the Iraqis back off and start moving
out of Kuwait.''
   ``We need to get to get their military forces out of Kuwait. I
think that is the most important thing now because they threaten
Saudi Arabia. In doing that, though, we have to have the
cooperation of the Saudis in terms of helping with the blockade or
embargo _ and that cooperation itself makes it more likely the
Iraqis will take some action,'' the Georgia Democrat told CBS News.
   The aircraft carrier Saratoga was leaving Mayport, Fla., on a
week-long voyage to the gulf region. The battleship Wisconsin was
to leave Norfolk, Va., for the same area.
   They would join the carriers Independence and Eisenhower, which
Pentagon sources said had moved within range to launch warplanes
down the Persian Gulf to reach Iraqi targets.

   The Justice Department, suffering heartburn
over a plan by the maker of Pepto-Bismol to acquire the exclusive
sales rights for Maalox, filed suit Tuesday to stop the
stomach-remedy alliance.
   The Justice Department sought a court injunction under the
Clayton Anti-Trust Act to prevent Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which makes
Pepto-Bismol, from acquiring the exclusive rights to market and
distribute Maalox.
   Court papers filed in federal court in Philadelphia charged that
the proposed agreement between Procter &amp; Gamble and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., which makes Maalox, would lessen competition in the
market of over-the-counter stomach remedies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, sold $125 million worth
of Pepto-Bismol last year, or 14 percent of the domestic retail
market. Domestic sales of Maalox totalled $111 million last year or
12 percent of the market.
   Under the proposal, Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire the exclusive
rights to market and sell Maalox and an option to purchase the
manufacturing assets from Rhone-Pulenc Rorer, which is based in Ft.
Washington, Pa. The deal would make Procter &amp; Gamble the largest
seller of stomach remedies in the U.S. market, according to the
complaint.

   The United States could get enough energy from
the wind, sun, trees and rivers to eliminate dependence on oil
imported from countries like Iraq, proponents of renewable energy
said Tuesday.
   ``We should really have learned a lesson 17 years ago, when the
first Arab oil embargo struck the United States in October 1973,''
Ken Bossong of the public interest group Public Citizen told a news
conference. ``It is strategically dangerous and economically costly
to rely on imported oil.''
   Bossong urged state and federal government action to encourage
increased use of wind power, solar energy and biomass to reduce oil
consumption, thus diminishing reliance on imports.
   ``The cheapest, safest, cleanest option overall is simply
improving energy efficiency,'' he said.
   Already, renewable sources account for about 10 percent of the
energy produced in the United States, according to a Public Citizen
study published in June. Nearly half comes from hydroelectric
projects, but once-marginal projects like windmills, wood-fired
generators and solar heaters are growing fast, it found.
   ``I think we could wean ourselves off fossil fuels if we had a
commitment on the federal level,'' said Scott Sklar, director of
the Solar Energy Industries Association, who also spoke at the news
conference.
   Sklar said tougher environmental laws, a tax on carbon-dioxide
producing fuels and other government initiatives could give
renewable energy sources the boost they need to displace imported
oil.

   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez
promised Tuesday to do everything he could to make up crude oil
supplies lost by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a U.S. official said.
   The Venezuelan president also said other OPEC nations will try
to add to supplies and push down prices, the official reported.
   This official is traveling with Vice President Dan Quayle, who
conferred with Perez while both were in Bogota for the inauguration
of Cesar Gaviria as president of Colombia.
   The official reported afterward, on condition of anonymity, that
Perez had said, ``There will be no problem'' in making up for about
4.5 million barrels of oil a day that had been flowing from Iraq
and Kuwait, roughly 10 percent of world supply now under an
international embargo.
   Perez was quoted as telling Quayle that Venezuela would deliver
an additional 500,000 barrels a day. He said that Venezuela and
other OPEC states were working to stabilize oil prices at or near
the cartel's reference price of $21 a barrel.
   The price has soared to $28 dollars a barrel and more since the
invasion.
   Venezuela is a major oil producer, averaging 1.88 million
barrels a day last year, or about what Kuwait supplied. Forty-six
percent of Venezuela's output was sent to the United States.
   ``It's not good for anyone if there are rapid fluctuations,''
Perez was said to have told Quayle.
   The official said that Perez told Quayle he had been in constant
communication with other OPEC nations since Saddam Hussein's thrust
into Kuwait and that they agreed to make up shortages. No other
nations were specified.
   ``This is welcome news,'' Quayle was quoted as telling Perez
after a meeting and lunch at the Venezuelan Embassy.
   Quayle also conferred with Carlos Menem of Argentina, with
Gaviria and with Brazilian officials attending the inauguration,
urging that they join in withholding weapons and technology from
Iraq.
   After a 5{-hour flight from Washington to a heavily guarded
airfield outside the city, Quayle went by helicopter into Bogota to
meet Gaviria at the Bogota bank building that houses his transition
office.
   Security was tight at every step in the capital of a country
that has been ravaged by drug-related violence. Gaviria entered the
presidential race after a leading candidate was assassinated.
   ``I thank you for the gesture of coming,'' Gaviria told Quayle.
``We have the will always to have good relations with the United
States.''
   Quayle praised both Gaviria and outgoing president Virgilio
Barco for the Colombian stand against drug trafficking. He also
lauded the Colombians for sponsoring a United Nations resolution to
punish the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait cannot stand, will not
stand,'' Quayle told a news conference. He said Gaviria agreed with
that.
   The inaugural ceremony was the first stop on Quayle's three-day
trip to the Andean cocaine-producing nations, a follow-up to
President Bush's February drug summit with the presidents of
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   ``I am here for this inauguration to show the strong importance
the United States places on our continuing partnership with
Colombia,'' Quayle said.
   The vice president said the partnership goes beyond
drug-fighting activities to embrace trade and economic development.
He added that U.S.-Colombian talks on a new trade agreement will
begin by the first week in September.
   Amid signs of Colombian weariness with the violence stirred by
the campaign against cocaine, Quayle said he anticipates the new
administration will continue the fight begun by Barco.
   The vice president said he agreed with Gaviria that extradition
of Colombian cocaine traffickers to face trial in the United States
``isn't the only answer'' to the cocaine problem.
   ``But it is part of an answer. We anticipate extradition will go
forward and we think that it will,'' Quayle said.
   The extradition policy was launched by Barco as part of his
drug-fighting initiative. It has provoked a violent reaction from
the cocaine cartel.

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Plan For Limited Ruble Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a plan Tuesday to let
some businesses and organizations trade rubles for foreign currency
at market rates in a step toward making the ruble convertible.
   The ruble is not traded on world foreign currency exchanges, and
its convertibility is seen as essential to real economic reform in
the Soviet Union.
   The action announced Tuesday would establish currency markets in
the Soviet Union beginning Jan. 1, the official Tass news agency
said. It said the Soviet Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, took the
decision on Saturday.
   Legal enterprises and organizations _ but apparently not
individuals _ would be permitted to buy and sell foreign currency
in exchange for rubles at rates established by banks, currency
auctions and other operations, Tass said.
   It did not say what the other operations would be or what other
limits and controls would be placed on such markets.
   Currency auctions have been held in the Soviet Union in the past
among some Soviet enterprises.
   Tass said the decision to set up a currency market was prompted
by preparations for the Soviet Union's transition to a regulated
market economy. The government's plan for such a transition is to
go before the Soviet legislature next month.
   Tass did not say whether the government planned further
devaluations of the ruble.
   The government last devalued the ruble on Nov. 1, 1989. It was
devalued from $1.59 to 16 cents for travelers' cash exchanges. The
higher rate remains on commercial transactions.
   Officials said then that the official rate of $1.59 was not
realistic. On the black market, tourists can receive up to 20 times
as many rubles for their convertible currency as in state bank
outlets.
   Western economists say the ruble cannot become truly convertible
until the Soviet Union establishes a market pricing system for all
its goods and allows free cross-border trade. They also say it is
not possible to have a convertible currency in a controlled market.
   ``Development of the market relations in the currency sphere
will help to overcome tight limits of the principle of hard
currency self-repayment, to make currency resources more easily
available for all enterprises and organizations, and in advancing
toward convertibility of the ruble,'' Tass said.
   Tass said the currency exchanges will be set up in Moscow as
well as in other Soviet republics, with the Soviet State Bank
controlling operations.
   On Aug. 1, Soviet citizens were given permission to spend
foreign currency at special shops without telling the government
where they got the money.
   In addition, a special network of stores is to be set up, where
Soviet enterprises, as well as citizens, will be able to buy
imported and domestic goods for hard currency.

   The U.N. Security Council began work on
Tuesday to enforce the worldwide economic boycott it ordered
against Iraq, but so far the only weapon in the U.N. arsenal is
moral persuasion.
   The 15-member council began informal consultations on forming a
committee to monitor compliance by the member states with the
sanctions resolution adopted Monday.
   ``We already are in an enforcement mode,'' said a U.N. official.
   If the Security Council decides on military steps, it could call
for an international blockade of Iraq to force Iraqi invaders to
withdraw from Kuwait. But diplomats said Tuesday they hoped Iraq
would heed international will and force would not be necessary.
   Like many of the sources, the diplomats and U.N. official spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Publication of a member's failure to comply with the sanctions
is one of the strongest moves the United Nations can make, unless
it votes to take military action.
   President Bush on Tuesday ordered deployment of U.S. troops to
Saudi Arabia to help protect the oil-rich kingdom from Iraq, a
Pentagon source said. Iraq's increasingly isolated President Saddam
Hussein has rejected foreign pressure to withdraw his forces from
Kuwait.
   A separate source in Washington said the U.S. deployment would
be part of a multinational force.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar cabled copies of the
council's resolution to all 159 U.N. members Monday and informed
them the sanctions were legally binding.
   He was expected to request soon that all members inform him in
detail of steps they have taken to enforce the sanctions. He is to
report to the council in 30 days.
   The United Nations has no means of enforcing the resolution and
must rely on the good will of member states and international
pressure.
   The resolution, one of the strongest ever adopted by the
council, calls for a worldwide ban on oil purchases from Iraq; a
general trade embargo; freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, and a
halt to all military arms sales and aid to Iraq.
   It asks member states to supply information requested about
their trade, financial and military relations with Iraq.
   Canadian Ambassador L. Yves Fortier told the council Monday:
``The sanctions resolution would impose hardships on many
countries, public and private organizations and individuals
throughout the world. But sacrifices are necessary to maintain the
peace and security of states and the integrity of the international
system.''
   The U.N. boycott of Iraq was only the third time since the world
body was founded 45 years ago that the Security Council imposed
sanctions on a member state. In 1977, an arms embargo was imposed
on South Africa in an effort to force the government to dismantle
apartheid. In 1967, the council imposed a comprehensive embargo
against the white minority government of Rhodesia, which later
became Zimbabwe.
   If sanctions don't work, the Security Council could meet again
and call for international military action against Iraq.

<HEAD>Ratings Controversy Spreads to Video Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rating controversy that hit the film
industry two months ago is invading home video, bringing both worry
and new opportunities to the videocassette business.
   Blockbuster Video, the nation's leading chain with 12 percent of
video rentals, refuses to carry X-rated titles and won't take an
R-rated version of ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover.''
   A number of independent stores, facing labeling legislation, are
concerned about the proliferation of unrated films.
   ``It will be impossible to distribute `Frankenhooker' in video
stores if we can't get an R rating,'' James Glickenhaus, chairman
of Shapiro Glickenhaus Entertainment, said Tuesday during the Video
Software Dealers Association convention here.
   The film, which he called ``a horror comedy, not an adult
film,'' was rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America.
The rating is being appealed.
   Rhino Home Video, which will distribute the videocassette ``The
Best of Comic Relief '90,'' fears some of the comedians' rough
language in the video will yield rough sales.
   ``I think there are people who will get uptight about it,'' said
Rhino vice president Arny Schorr. Because Comic Relief was first
shown on cable's Home Box Office, it was not submitted to the MPAA
and therefore bears no rating.
   ``The rating system works only for theatrical releases,'' Schorr
said.
   Many small companies do not submit direct-to-video movies to the
MPAA ratings board, which charges about $1,000 to rate films.
   According to the MPAA, 25 states are considering legislation
aimed at making stores display cassette ratings. Titles with no
ratings _ everything from Jane Fonda exercise tapes to low-budget
slasher films like ``Three on a Meathook '' _ would have to carry
no-rating stickers in most of those states.
   Vidmark Entertainment will release its controversial ``The Cook,
the Thief'' in two versions _ unrated and R-rated. Company
representatives say that Blockbuster Video won't take the R-rated
version and has yet to decide on the unrated edition.
   For many filmmakers, the home video market gives them a chance
to release their movies the way they intended, without making cuts
needed for an R rating in theaters.
   According to Steven Apple, executive editor of the trade
publication Video Insider, renters are likely to prefer the unrated
versions of ``Angel Heart'' and ``Wild Orchid'' to the R-rated cuts
of the same films.
   One company, 10th Avenue Video, is producing soft-core movies it
hopes will satisfy customers in markets where adult films are
either banned or hidden in a back corner. The company's new
release, ``Intimate Lessons,'' is actually a more modest version of
the hard-core film ``Veil.''
   ``We want to ride the line on this,'' said 10th Avenue's Bill
Nash. ``We want a husband and wife to watch this and not have the
wife say, `Why did you bring this piece of trash home?''' The film
about strippers, he said, can also be sold in mass-market stores
that do not stock adult films.
   Turner Home Video, seeking to cut the cost of ratings and find
more descriptive classifications, submits its video releases to the
Film Advisory Board.
   In May, Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's film ``Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!'' attracted a storm of controversy before its release
in this country. The MPAA ratings board recoiled at a graphic sex
scene and dealt the film an X rating. An appeal failed to reverse
the decision.
   FAB ratings include M for mature and AO for adults only. The FAB
rating system, unlike the MPAA, describes content, too, listing
degrees of nudity, violence and substance abuse. ``Treasure
Island'' earned an F for family, as opposed to a C for children.

<TEXT>
   A defiant Saddam Hussein vowed Tuesday
that he will never back down despite growing international pressure
to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   The Iraqi president said last week's invasion was meant to
correct flawed borders drawn up by the colonial powers that left a
corrupt minority in control of the Arabian Peninsula's rich oil
reserves while the Arab masses suffered.
   He said he would reject any foreign pressure for him to pull his
forces out of Kuwait.
   ``We would rather die than be humiliated, and we will pluck out
the eyes of those who attack the Arab nation,'' Saddam said in a
speech read by an annnouncer for Baghdad Radio, monitored in
Nicosia.
   The speech reiterated much of the rhetoric Saddam has been using
since first launching a blistering verbal attack against the
Kuwaiti royal family July 17, two weeks before Thursday's invasion.
   The Kuwait invasion has ushered in ``a new period in which the
sun will shine on us in the coming days,'' Saddam said.
   In his speech, Saddam apparently tried to play on the resentment
felt by many poorer Arabs toward the oil-rich sheiks.
   Saddam said the colonial powers drew up the borders of Middle
East nations to keep the population centers away from the region's
wealth of natural resources.
   Britain and France were the main colonial powers who helped
reshape the map of the Middle East after World War I eliminated
Turkish dominance over the region.
   Saddam said the colonial powers left ``the minority with a vast
amount of rich reserves of the area it did not own, while the
majority fell in need.'' Due to their wealth, the minority made
``corrupt decisions'' in alliance with the West, which Saddam said
was worse than falling under foreign occupation.
   Saddam said the Kuwaiti invasion carried on the tradition of
Iraqi victories that started with the Gulf war with Iran in 1980-88.
   That war ended in a cease-fire in August 1988 and no peace
treaty has been signed. More than 100,000 prisoners of war remain
to be exchanged and the disputed Shatt al-Arab, Iraq's main outlet
to the Gulf, remains blocked.
   Saddam has claimed the war as a major victory even though he did
not gain control over the Shatt al-Arab, his initial objective in
starting the war, or gain much territory from Iran.

<HEAD>Iraq Continues Jamming Voice Of America Broadcasts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has been jamming the Arabic-language
broadcasts of the Voice of America for the past three days, the
station announced Tuesday.
   The government-funded radio station said it will try to bypass
the interruption by beaming its programs to Iraq through satellite
television broadcasts starting Tuesday night.
   Iraqis can tune in to these radio broadcasts on their television
sets if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local
TV station. VOA's Deputy Director Robert Coonrod said many Iraqis
have such access.
   Iraq is also jamming the BBC's Arabic-language radio programs
from England, Coonrod said. The English-language programs of the
VOA and BBC have not been blocked, he said.
   The jamming affects all VOA's broadcasts to the Middle East,
including the Persian Gulf and Jordan, he said. Egypt is partly
affected, too.
   VOA is increasing the number of hours it broadcasts in Arabic to
the Middle East, from seven and a-half daily to nearly 10, and
replacing the music programs with more news, Coonrod said. The
broadcasts have been heavy on news about the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwaiti and international efforts to punish President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``We want Iraqis to have accurate, uncensored information,''
Coonrod said.
   Iraq is a police state, and the media is government-controlled
and severely restricted.
   Satellite transmissions, too, can be jammed. But experts say
Iraq would need to jam the entire Indian Ocean satellite in order
to block VOA.
   VOA officials hope the experiment with Iraq succeeds as it did
in China last summer, after Chinese authorities jammed the VOA's
short and medium-wave broadcasts during Beijing's crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   Coonrod said Iraq is using a type of sophisticated technique
called ``bubble jamming'' which was used to block radio programs
from Iran during the eight-year war between the two countries.

<TEXT>
   A group calling itself the Palestine
Revolutionary Squads said Tuesday it will release within 24 hours
two Swiss hostages of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   The previously unknown faction made the announcement in a
handwritten Arabic language statement delivered to the independent
Beirut newspaper An-Nahar shortly before midnight Tuesday.
   The 10-line statement was accompanied by an instant, color
photograph of Swiss captive Emmanuel Christen, 32. The close-up
showed him with a short beard and moustache.
   The other hostage is Elio Erriquez, 23.
   The two were kidnapped on Oct. 6, 1989 in Sidon, the provincial
capital of south Lebanon. No group had previously claimed
responsibility for their abduction.
   The statement said the decision to free the Red Cross captives
came in response to the wishes of President Hafez Assad of Syria,
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and President Chadli Bendjedid
of Algeria.
   It also said the group had guarantees that its demands would be
met, but did not specify what the demands were.
   An earlier report had said no picture accompanied the statement.
   Police in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, had blamed the
abduction of Christen and Erriquez on the Libyan-financed
Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction, led by notorious Palestinian
terrorist Abu Nidal. The group denied it. The Abu Nidal group has
been reported undergoing bloody internal purges over the past year.
   The two Swiss captives are among 16 foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon. The others are six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was seized in Beirut on
March 16, 1985.
   Two American hostages _ educators Frank Herbert Reed and Robert
Polhill _ were released eight days apart in April.
   This is the text of Tuesday's statement:
   ``After we acquired guarantees that our demands will be met, and
in response to the wishes of the Syrian command personified by the
president, Field Marshal Hafez Assad, the leader of the September 1
revolution, brother Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Algerian president
Chadli Bendjedid that the two International Red Cross delegates we
hold be released, and after expressing our gratitude for the
efforts exerted by them to fulfill the demands we presented, the
organization of the Palestinian Revolutionary squads announces that
it has decided to free the two Swiss prisoners within the next 24
hours.
   ``Victory shall be for the revolution,
   ``The Palestinian Revolutionary Squads.''

   Leaders of the two Germanys and their

   As politicians feuded over whether unity in September or October
would best help the beleaguered East Germans, a senior official
warned that East German economy is falling into ``chaos'' and
conditions will only get worse.
   Reiner Gohlke, who is overseeing East Germany's economic reform
attempts, was quoted by the East German newspaper Neue Zeit as
saying: ``The situation is worse than I had thought. We have chaos.
Nothing is running normally.''
   A major lobbying group, the West German Association of Industry
and Trade, demanded that unity come ``as soon as possible'' before
East Germany's economy collapses. ``Every day of divided political
responsibility in both parts of Germany prolongs'' troubles in East
Germany, it said in a statement.
   East Germany, meanwhile, announced that joblessness nearly
doubled within a month, spiraling to 272,017.
   Deteriorating economic and social conditions in East Germany are
central to the political dispute in both German states over when
unity and all-German elections should occur.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday rejected demands
by the opposition Social Democrats that the two countries merge by
Sept. 15 and elections for an all-German parliament be held on Dec.
2.
   Kohl told reporters after meeting Social Democratic leaders he
will not budge from his plan for all-German elections and
simultaneous unity on Oct. 14.
   He said his East German Christian Democratic allies, led by
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, will propose a parliamentary
resolution on Wednesday supporting unity and elections on Oct. 14.
On Thursday, his own coalition will make a similar proposal in the
Bundestag, West Germany's parliament, he added.
   East Germany's Social Democrats, who are in de Maiziere's
coalition, plan to offer their own measure on Wednesday calling for
German unity by Sept. 15 and elections later.
   Richard Schroeder, parliamentary chief of the East German Social
Democrats, told reporters in East Berlin his party and de Maiziere
were in ``insurmountable disagreement.''
   In Bonn, Kohl said he still plans to seek a change in West
Germany's constitution to allow elections on Oct. 14. Under
constitutional constraints, Dec. 2 would be the earliest for new
elections.
   But Kohl needs Social Democratic support for the two-thirds
parliamentary majority he needs for a constitutional change, and
that opposition party swears he will not get his two-thirds.
   Both sides claim their respective unity and elections time
proposals are best for helping out troubled East Germany.
   The Social Democrats claim Kohl wants the earlier election date
because he fears voters will turn against him as East Germany's
economy erodes.
   Kohl says separating unity from elections could have bad
psychological effects on East Germans, who want the two to occur
simultaneously.

   As many as 1,000 poor city students could be
enrolled in private schools with state money this fall, say
supporters who won a court challenge of the nations' first school
voucher plan.
   However, opponents, including Wisconsin's top education offical,
said they'd appeal the ruling before the program takes effect this
fall.
   Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Steingass on Monday ruled the
program was legal because it aims to improve education ``to the
benefit of the entire state,'' thereby filling the ``public
purpose'' requirement of Wisconsin's Constitution.
   The program, approved by the Legislature and signed by Gov.
Tommy Thompson last spring, provides up to $2,500 in state money
per pupil to let poor Milwaukee schoolchildren attend non-sectarian
private schools.
   This year's budget includes funding _ to be deducted from the
city's school budget _ for 1,000 students, who would receive
vouchers from the state. Milwaukee has about 97,000 students.
   The average yearly tuition to a Milwaukee private school is
about $3,200.
   State School Superintendent Herbert Grover and the Wisconsin
Education Association Council, the state's largest teachers' union,
said the program undermines public education and that private
schools are not fully accountable to the state.
   Grover, the union and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit seeking to block the
subsidies.
   Steingass said Grover exceeded his authority in devising
requirements for participating private schools and ordered him to
carry out the Legislature's intent.
   Grover said Tuesday he was disappointed with the ruling but
anticipated it would be appealed. The union's president also said
an appeal was likely.
   ``We're going to have two school systems in this state and both
paid for by public money,'' he said. ``One will have accountability
and one won't.''
   However, the program's sponsor called the ruling a victory for
parents and students.
   ``This is the right thing to do. We are trying to save our
children that our dying right now because the Milwaukee Public
Schools are not doing their job,'' said Rep. Polly Williams.
   ``The children are going to be in these schools this year,'' she
said.
   About 10 private schools in Milwaukee, with students in
kindergarten through eighth grade, would participate in the
program. They were deluged with student applicants, she said.
   One of the participants, Urban Day School, accepted about 100
student transfers but had to reject another 200 because of a lack
of room, Executive Director Zakiya Courtney said Tuesday.
   `There's some disappointment for parents whose children could
not get in the school,'' Ms. Courtney said. ``But those parents who
did get are elated because now their children have the same
opportunity that others have had but they could not afford in the
past.''

   The former chairman of a failed Texas savings
and loan association has been charged with embezzling more than $4
million after purchasing a controlling interest in the thrift in
1985, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday.
   Alan Ross Rothery, a California attorney and former chairman of
Trinity Valley Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, Texas,
was accused of bank fraud, embezzlement, self-dealing and giving
false information to a federal bank examiner.
   Each count carries a five-year sentence and a possible $250,000
fine.
   The indictment, returned Aug. 2 by a federal grand jury in
Beaumont, Texas, was unsealed in court Tuesday.
   It accuses Rothery and two California businessman, Errol
Coughlan, of Malibu, and John Coughlan Jr., of Long Beach, of
participating in a scheme to fraudulently divert loan proceeds.
   The brothers were accused of aiding and abetting the fraudulent
loan diversion. They also were charged with making false statements
on loan applications and participating in a separate bank-fraud
scheme to divert funds to their own use.
   On July 24, the Coughlans were named in a 17-count fraud
indictment returned in Los Angeles that accuses them of defrauding
a number of financial institutions.
   The Texas thrift was taken over by federal regulators in March
1989 and sold Oct. 6, 1989, to Hibernia National Bank in Texas,
regulators said. The loss to the government for insured deposits
and speculative loans is expected to reach $33 million, the Justice
Department said.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said
Trinity Valley is on the agency's list of top 100 S&amp;Ls that were
referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecutions.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that ``the
alleged scheme whereby Rothery acquired ownership of Trinity Valley
and manipulated the institution's loan proceeds to satisfy his own
greed is a textbook example of criminal fraud in our nation's
thrift industry.''

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi Airways jet carrying 78 foreigners
and some Iraqis arrived here Tuesday, the first commercial flight
allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese embassy
spokesman said.
   No Americans were on the flight.
   Thousands of Westerners remain stranded in Kuwait and Iraq since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said Iraq has offered to
allow Britons in Baghdad on short-term visas to leave. It was not
clear if the offer included several hundred foreigners rounded up
in Kuwait and taken to Iraq, including Americans, Britons, West
Germans and a Spaniard.
   Those rounded up included 350 passengers on a British Airways
flight bound for Malaysia that was caught in the unrest in Kuwait.
   A British Airways spokeswoman said a ``substantial'' number of
those passengers arrived safely in Baghdad on Monday. Among the
passengers were 28 Americans, who also turned up in a Baghdad hotel
and appear to be fine, a U.S. official said in Washington.
   ``We do not know what is happening to people after they arrive
in Baghdad,'' said the British Airways spokeswoman.
   Thirty-four British servicemen and an oil field worker picked up
in Kuwait over the weekend are being held in Baghdad.
   The Iraqi offer appeared to apply only to tourists and
businessmen but not to British residents in Iraq, said the Foreign
Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman added they were trying to confirm and clarify the
Iraqi offer.
   Those allowed to leave would probably travel through Jordan,
which has told the Foreign Office that it would receive people and
grant them visas.
   ``We are making preparations to receive a huge number of
people,'' said one Jordanian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Until Tuesday, there had been no indication of what plans Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has for foreigners in occupied Kuwait or
Iraq.
   Iraq's ambassador to Greece, Abdel Fatah Al Khereji, said
Tuesday, ``any foreigners in Kuwait who wish to leave ... can do so
by land from Iraq through Turkey or Jordan.''
   The first large group of foreigners to arrive from Baghdad were
those on board the Iraqi Airways flight, which arrived at Queen
Alia International Airport, 30 miles south of Amman, the Jordanian
capital, at 6:15 p.m., the Japanese diplomat said.
   Most of the foreigners on the flight were Japanese tourists who
were visiting Iraq, the diplomat said. Also on board the Boeing 727
jetliner were two Belgians, a Spaniard, a Dutchman, an Italian, as
well as 34 members of an Iraqi soccer team, he said.
   ``We are very happy that we are in Jordan,'' said Masyi Yoshiko,
a computer clerk from Tokyo. ``It was very difficult for me to be
in a country at war.''
   Ms. Yoshiko, 42, said the group did not feel threatened at all
after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on Thursday, but were not allowed
to leave their hotel for five days.
   ``We enjoyed our stay in the hotel,'' she said. ``Iraqi people
were not bad. The people and police were very good with us.''
   The embassy spokesman said the plane was supposed to fly on to
Vienna after refueling, but the Austrian government denied landing
rights.
   The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted sanctions that impose
a ban on trade and financial contacts with Iraq.
   Hundreds of foreigners are expected to flood into Jordan in the
next two days once Iraqi authorities ease travel restrictions for
foreigners stranded by the invasion.
   Iraq's borders and airports were completely closed. The only
people to escape from Kuwait since Saturday used obscure desert
routes into Saudi Arabia.
   A Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day were fleeing
Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia. The businessman, who
arrived in London on a British Airways flight from Bahrain today,
said Kuwaitis and expatriates, including Westerners, were joining
convoys to escape the Iraqi forces.
   Earlier Tuesday, Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim
Izzedine, said the U.S. government had asked Jordan to facilitate
the entrance from Iraq of American diplomats and their dependents.
   U.S. Embassy officials said about 12 diplomats in addition to
their dependents are expected to arrive in Jordan from Iraq on
Wednesday.
   The ``provisional government of free Kuwait'' set up by Iraq had
threatened Sunday to hold hostage citizens of countries imposing
sanctions on it.
   Kuwait's ambassador in London said that despite the Iraqi
assurances about allowing foreigners to leave, Iraq might choose to
hold some Westerners as a bargaining chip.
   ``He (Saddam) will choose some to keep,'' said Ambassador Ghazi
Al-Rayes said. ``He can't afford to keep 5,000 or 10,000 hostages.
He will keep Americans, Europeans, whatever nationalities he thinks
are valuable.
   ``Maybe he will behave like anyone who hijacks a plane. He has
hijacked a country.''
   A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed ``American
citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when
circumstances permit.''

   A naval blockade to sever Iraq's oil lifeline
may be the best hope for pushing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, but
it would require hundreds of ships and perhaps months of
enforcement, military experts said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, government sources said President Bush was
dispatching American warplanes and ground troops to Saudi Arabia
where they were to be joined by forces from Egypt and Morocco in an
effort to discourage Iraq from pushing on into Kuwait's larger
neighbor.
   While that move was being made and talk continued of a United
Nations-sanctioned blockade by U.S., European and perhaps Soviet
forces, other more drastic and risky military options were
available, experts said.
   Among the options:
   _Launch air strikes on Iraqi oil fields. Iraq's economy is built
on oil. Destroying the oil production facilities would be
tantamount to destroying the economy.
   _Bomb troop supply lines in southern Iraq. The purpose would be
to isolate the 100,000-man Iraqi occupation force in Kuwait by
preventing supplies and reinforcements from crossing the border.
   _Engage the Iraqis in a full-scale air and land battle in Kuwait
and Iraq. Experts say this would be highly costly and would risk
starting an Arab-Israeli war.
   The U.N. Security Council voted 13-0 on Monday to impose a
worldwide ban on trade with Iraq. Bush hinted afterward that he was
prepared to order a naval blockade to enforce that embargo if Iraq
finds a way to circumvent it.
   ``These sanctions will be enforced, no matter what it takes,''
Bush said Monday.
   Vice Adm. Henry C. Mustin, a recently retired deputy chief of
naval operations, said in an interview that an international naval
blockade of Iraq's three main oil outlets _ in the Mediterranean
Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea _ would be the best military
option so long as Saddam has not invaded Saudi Arabia.
   Mustin added, however, that a blockade would run the risk of
triggering actual combat.
   ``A blockade is an act of war. To effect a blockade you have to
enforce it,'' he said.
   If the United States set a blockade on its own the operation
``would take probably most of the U.S. Navy,'' meaning several
hundred ships and tens of thousands of sailors, Mustin said.
   Reconnaissance aircraft would be needed to ensure that tankers
in the gulf not carrying Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil actually arrived at
their stated destinations.
   A joint operation with European allies would be more effective,
Mustin said. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Pentagon
had proposed an international blockade that would include Soviet
ships, but a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ``I don't
think that we are thinking about such an idea.''
   The United States has two aircraft carrier groups in the gulf
area and a third on the way. It also has a group of eight naval
ships inside the gulf. Britain has one ship in the gulf and two
more due by week's end. On Tuesday a French naval destroyer sailed
into the Suez Canal enroute to the gulf by way of the Red Sea.
   Journalists in helicopters reported spotting a Soviet destroyer
nearing the Straits of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the gulf from
the Arabian Sea.
   Gen. Jack Merritt, recently retired from the Army and a former
U.S. representative to NATO's highest military council, said he
doubted that either a naval blockade or carrier-based air strikes
against Iraqi economic targets would be enough.
   Of the chances of dislodging the Iraqi army from Kuwait with air
power alone Merritt said, ``Just forget it.''
   Merritt said that if Bush's goal is to deter Saddam from
striking at Saudi Arabia the administration should already be
moving ground and air forces into the gulf area from Western
Europe. The United States has no military bases in the area.
   In the event the 1 million-strong Iraqi army moved on Saudi
Arabia, the United States would be compelled to engage in a ground
war, Merritt said. That would require perhaps 500,000 U.S. troops,
plus large numbers of attack aircraft and bombers, he said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Tuesday that in addition to preparing for a
possible naval blockage of Iraq, the Bush administration should be
trying to persuade Egypt or other Arab nations to participate in a
multinational ground force deterrent in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I think it's enormously important this not simply be a
Saudi-U.S. operation,'' Nunn told CBS News. ``We need our allies
involved, but the Saudis also need the indigenous Arab forces that
will come to their aid.''
   Nunn's counterpart in the House, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia as a tripwire, or deterrent
force, would a ``high risk'' option, one that would mean an
American commitment to all-out war with Iraq.
   ``The message to Mr. Hussein would be, `If you attack those
American troops, right along that line, I mean that is war right to
the end'.''

   The State Department on Tuesday voiced concern
about any interruption of democracy in Pakistan and said it expects
the new military-backed caretaker government to carry out promised
October elections.
   Four Democratic senators including Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Claiborne Pell strongly criticized Monday's dismissal of
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by Pakistan's president and said they
are concerned about the safety of Ms. Bhutto and her family.
   In dismissing Ms. Bhutto, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan announced
new parliamentary elections for Oct. 24. ``We expect they will take
place,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told
reporters.
   ``We strongly support democracy taking root in Pakistan, and we
are concerned about any action that would interrupt that process,''
Ms. Tutwiler said, adding, ``we are watching this closely because
we are concerned.''
   The statement of U.S. concern went beyond the State Department's
initial reaction Monday calling Prime Minister Bhutto's dismissal
``an internal matter for the people of Pakistan to decide.''

<TEXT>
   Richard Secord, who ran the illegal Contra supply
network for Oliver North, testified Tuesday that the State
Department and the CIA were briefed on the operation several times.
   Secord and Miami-based Southern Air Transport are being sued by
Eugene Hasenfus of Marinette, Wis., the only survivor of the
October 1986 cargo plane crash in Nicaragua that helped expose the
network supplying Nicaraguan rebels.
   Secord, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the
Iran-Contra scandal and is serving probation, took the stand as a
hostile witness for Hasenfus. He quickly sought to play down his
control over the network and its finances.
   Secord said he ran the operation ``in conjunction with the White
House and some private companies.''
   When Congress moved toward again granting lethal aid to the
Contras in the fall of 1986, it was decided to turn the private
supply operation over to the CIA, he said.
   ``It was my understanding that there were several interagency
meetings, including the State Department and the CIA,'' Secord
testified.
   He sparred with Hasenfus attorney Brian Strange over his control
of Swiss bank accounts through which money from the Iran arms sale
was funneled to the supply operation.
   Strange read Secord his 1987 congressional testimony saying he
had verbal control over the accounts. Secord eventually conceded
that point.
   But he bristled when asked if he was to keep the profits left in
those accounts when the government took over later in 1986.
   ``I don't think I've ever taken that position,'' he said,
although he agreed the ``enterprise'' would keep whatever money
remained.
   After a lunch break, Strange asked Secord if within the past
month he had transferred $92,000 from the sale of spare Contra
supply plane parts to his personal account.
   After the judge overruled objections to the question, Secord
responded, ``Yes.''
   ``My attorneys offered to settle,'' Secord said before Senior
U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins interrupted him. Secord
apparently referred to meetings before the trial in which the two
sides attempted to reach a settlement.
   Atkins has ruled that Strange may refer to Secord's conviction
to attack his credibility, and Strange did. Secord had pleaded
guilty to lying to congressional investigators about money North
received from the enterprise.
   Jurors, who are allowed to ask questions through the judge,
wanted to know why Secord did not pay death benefits to the family
of co-pilot Wallace Sawyer Jr., even though he controlled the bank
accounts.
   Secord said he had ordered his attorney to do so but the
congressional investigation into the case frightened the lawyer,
who never made the payment.
   Hasenfus' attorney zeroed in on that question, noting that
Secord had ordered $250,000 paid to Southern Air Transport a year
later, yet had chosen not to pay the victims' families.
   ``You're quite wrong,'' an angry Secord responded. ``You can put
any kind of gloss on it you want.''
   Secord retired as an Air Force general in 1983 and shortly
afterward was recruited by North, a National Security Council aide
working out of the White House, to run the network at a time
Congress had banned lethal aid to the Contras.
   Hasenfus and Sawyer's family of Magnolia, Ark., say Secord ran
the operation and is responsible for misleading the crews and using
shoddy equipment that led to their plane being shot down by a
Nicaraguan rocket.
   Hasenfus parachuted to safety, and was held captive by
Nicaragua's Sandinista government for three months before being
released.
   Secord has said he never met Hasenfus or Sawyer.
   Southern Air has denied involvement with the Hasenfus flight and
claims Hasenfus and Sawyer worked for Corporate Air Services, a
separate company.
   The two families have listed actual damages of just under $4
million, but that does not include distress or punitive damages.

<HEAD>Justice Asks End of Anti-trust Immunity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Tuesday urged the
withdrawal of a longstanding immunity of U.S. airlines from
anti-trust laws that allows the companies to fix fares to and from
this country.
   The department's anti-trust division made the recommendation in
comments filed with the Transportation Department, which is
considering whether to extend the anti-trust immunity for the
International Air Transport Association.
   IATA's members, who include American and foreign airlines, set
international air fares under an anti-trust immunity that the
organization has enjoyed since 1946.
   The Federal Aviation Act allows the granting of such anti-trust
exemptions to further ``international comity'' or other foreign
policy interests.
   The Justice Department said that ``when persons affected by
price fixing are U.S. consumers and the airlines involved are U.S.
carriers, the U.S. interest is clearly paramount.''
   It urged the Transportation Department to review on a
country-by-country basis the anti-trust immunity give foreign-owned
carriers to fix fares on flights to and from the United States.
   ``Immunity for IATA appears particularly unwarranted in those
markets where the involved foreign government does not actively
support or favor cartel pricing,'' the Justice Department said,
noting that European Common Market nations are pushing for
increased airline competiton.
   ``Many Americans may not realize that the prices of their
airline tickets for travel abroad are set by what is in efect a
legalized international cartel,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said in a statement.
   ``Lower fares and better service are what we seek,'' the
attorney general said. ``With so many of the countries of the world
now recognizing the benefits of competitive free-market economies,
we should not continue to grant blanket immunity to a multilateral
cartel, but should address the needs and concerns of individual
foreign governments on a case-by-case basis,'' Thornburgh said.
   Now that airline deregulation has promoted competition on
domestic flights, ``there is a strong interest in protecting
consumers when they travel on U.S. carriers from the United States
to foreign countries,'' said James F. Rill, assistant attorney
general for anti-trust.

<HEAD>Architect of Modern Corporate Buildings Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gordon Bunshaft, whose designs for glass and
steel office towers helped form a style of modern corporate
architecture, died after a brief illness, his firm said Wednesday.
He was 81.
   Bunshaft, a retired partner in Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, died
of cardiac arrest at his home in Manhattan on Monday.
   Bunshaft's first big project, Lever House, was also his most
famous. The 24-story, blue-green office building constructed in
1952 introduced the sleek International Style to Manhattan's Park
Avenue, then lined by traditional masonry buildings.
   Architecture critic Wolf Von Eckardt called Lever House ``the
proud proclamation of a new era,'' and it helped make Skidmore one
of the nation's leading design firms. Lever House was designated a
New York City landmark in 1982, the first structure of its kind to
win that designation.
   Bunshaft also designed a number of other Manhattan office
towers, including the Manufacturer's Hanover Trust building, the
PepsiCo building and the headquarters of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
The latter brought modernism to the financial district, as Lever
House had to Park Avenue.
   Bunshaft's designs outside New York included the Lyndon Baines
Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden in Washington, and his last and most elaborate
project, the National Commercial Bank in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
   The latter, a triangular-shaped building 27 stories high with no
apparent front or back, ``is so abstract that it is impossible to
judge its actual size except upon close examination,'' noted The
New York Times. ``It barely reads as a building.''
   In 1988 Bunshaft was awarded the Pritzker Prize for architecture
in recognition of his early designs. He also was a member of the
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and a fellow of
the American Institute of Architects.
   Bunshaft is survived by his wife, Nina.

<HEAD>Stark Apologizes To Sullivan Over Racial Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Pete Stark apologized to Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan for calling him a ``disgrace to
his race'' last week, spokesmen said on Tuesday.
   Neither Sullivan nor Stark's office would release the text of
the letter of apology delivered Monday night.
   ``He did apologize,'' said Bob Shemermund, a spokesman for
Sullivan.
   Stark's remark last week infuriated Sullivan, the only black
member of President Bush's Cabinet, who called the statement
``incomprehensibly offensive.''
   Stark, who said the intended target of his criticism was Bush
administration policies he believes harm blacks and the poor, said
on the House floor afterward, ``I blew it.''
   Sullivan did not take that as an apology.
   He did take the letter that way, but did not send a reply,
Schmermund said.
   In a speech Tuesday, Sullivan said ``he accepted the apology and
considered the incident closed,'' Schmermund said.
   Perry Plumart, a spokesman for Stark, refused to discuss the
contents of the letter.

   Defense Minister Moshe Arens called Tuesday for
stronger Western measures against Iraq in a speech underscoring
growing nervousness here over the invasion of Kuwait by the Jewish
state's most formidable Arab foe.
   Arens' speech to Parliament was made before President Bush
ordered U.S. troops and warplanes to the front line Tuesday to
guard Saudi Arabia against Iraq.
   Other officials said Israel would favor a U.S.-led naval
blockade to bring an end to the Gulf conflict.
   In an early reaction here to the latest U.S. move, Ron
Ben-Ishai, political analyst and journalist for the Yediot Ahronot
newspaper, said on Israel army radio:
   ``This is not completely suprising. It was expected that the
U.S. would want to land soldiers in Saudi Arabia but what was not
expected was that the Saudis would agree so quickly. ... If it is
true, it is indeed a extraordinary change ... in Saudi policy, that
needed great courage, because they will (have to) deal with the
results if the Americans don't succeed.''
   Other analysts said earlier that considerable concern existed in
Israel that unless Saddam was reined in, the unpredictable Iraqi
president could pose a direct threat to Israel.
   They noted Saddam's warnings this spring that he would torch
half of Israel with binary chemical weapons if Iraq ever came under
attack by Israel. Saddam was accused of using chemical arms against
Kurdish rebels at home and against Iranian forces during his
eight-year war with Iran.
   ``Unfortunately the international community didn't take any
action after he used chemical weapons and threatened to attack
Israel with chemical weapons,'' Arens said.
   ``Nations of the world have a capability to influence Iraq. The
nations of the world can prove that aggression doesn't pay. And
that Iraq will pay the heaviest price for attacks staged by its
leaders.''
   Arens warned that ``Saddam Hussein is liable not to suffice with
Kuwait just as he didn't suffice with his attack on Iran,'' in
September 1980 which led to a war that went on until 1988.
   ``He has a big army and limitless aspirations,'' Arens said of
Saddam.
   Arens reiterated that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday
``doesn't constitute a geostrategic change for Israel. But the
moment we detect such a change like the entry of Iraqi forces into
Jordan, we will act.''
   Jordan has a long border with Israel.
   King Hussein of Jordan, facing serious economic and political
problems, has lately forged an alliance with Saddam.
   In February, Jordan and Iraq announced formation of a joint air
force training squadron.
   Arens said Israel was closely watching developments in Kuwait.
``We will know to defend our interests and security,'' he concluded.
   Moshe Shahal, a former Cabinet minister of the left-of-center
Labor Party, said of Saddam: ``If he has a problem with the Arabs,
that's his problem. But if someone messes with us, we know how to
settle an account. And you, Saddam Hussein, will bring a Holocaust
on yourself and your people because Israel is not Kuwait.''

Occupation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Early foreign reaction Tuesday to the dispatch of
U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia described it as certain to strengthen
the Saudis, but unlikely to bring a swift end to Iraq's occupation
of Kuwait.
   ``I think that this is an obvious step that has to be taken if
Iraq is to be deterred from some move forward in Saudi Arabia...,''
said Sir John Moberly, a former British ambassador to Iraq who is
now with the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
   ``It is a protective measure,'' he said in a television
interview. ``But I agree that to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait
is a very different question, and it's a very long haul.''
   In The Hague, a Dutch government official predicted the
deployment of U.S. forces would bring a substantial
``de-escalation'' of the tense situation in the Persian Gulf.
   Because of the move, ``We're pretty much drifting toward a kind
of stalemate,'' said the official, who declined to be identified by
name.
   ``The world is now going to wait until shortages develop in Iraq
and then we'll be able to find an elegant way out for Saddam
Hussein,'' the source said.
   In Israel, political analyst Ron Ben-Ishai of the newspaper
Yediot Ahronot said on Israel army radio:
   ``This is not completely suprising. It was expected that the
U.S. would want to land soldiers in Saudi Arabia, but what was not
expected was that the Saudis would agree so quickly.

   The Army units readying for duty in Saudi
Arabia are part of the nation's rapid deployment force, a
contingent of air and land forces created during the Carter
administration to respond to a Middle East crisis.
   Pentagon sources said Tuesday that President Bush had ordered
elements of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky.;
the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga., and
the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said elements
of those three units would be deployed with the 18th Airborne
Corps, a command and control unit at Fort Bragg that directs
operations of the three combat divisions.
   The Bush administration declined to confirm the deployment plan,
which sources said was designed as part of a multinational
deterrent force to be placed in Saudi Arabia as a warning to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein not to attack the desert kingdom.
   It could not be learned whether parts or all of the three
divisions would participate in the operation.
   The 82nd Airborne Division, with 12,000 soldiers, is paratroop
divison, one of the Army's elite units ever since World War II. It
has three brigades, with three battalions in each brigade. Each
battalion is equipped with 20 TOW anti-tank weapons.
   The 101st Airborne Division, with about 15,400 troops, includes
two attack battalions armed with 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters and 18
AH-1 Cobra anti-tank helicopters. Also included are two assault
helicopter battalions, each with 45 Blackhawk helicopters.
   Its soldiers are not paratroopers, and are carried into battle
by helicopters.
   The division also has one medium lift helicopter battalion
equipped with 18 CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and one air cavalry
squadron, which performs air reconnaissance with 12 AH-1 Cobra
helicopters and 12 OH-58 observation helicopters.
   The 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) has 16,600 soldiers and
is composed of two active combat brigades and one in the Georgia
National Guard. The active brigades include three M-1 tank
battalions, each with 58 tanks, and three infantry battalions, each
with 54 Bradley fighting vehicles. The Bradleys double as personnel
carriers.
   The 24th also has two active artillery battalions equipped with
155mm self-propelled artillery, and one active battalion equipped
with nine multiple-launch rocket systems.
   The air power of the 24th includes one company of 15 UH-60
Blackhawk troop transport helicopters and one company of about 18
AH-1 Cobra anti-tank helicopters.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Cabinet, Premier Resign In Routine Procedure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgarian Premier Andrei Lukanov and his
Cabinet resigned Tuesday to allow the country's new president to
choose his own cabinet, the state BTA news agency reported.
   The action took place a week after Parliament elected Zhelyu
Zhelev the first non-Communist president in more than four decades,
BTA reported.
   Lukanov, a 51-year-old multilingual economist and a former
moderate Communist, was elected premier in February. BTA said he
was likely to continue as premier, heading a new Cabinet to be
chosen at a four-day parliament session that opened Tuesday.
   The new government is expected to include independent experts
and possibly members of the democratic opposition as well as of
Lukanov's Socialist party, formerly the Communists. The former
Communist party won free elections in June but has lost power
steadily since then. Lukanov has repeatedly said he does not want
to head an all-Socialist cabinet.
   Lukanov submitted his cabinet's resignation, as mandated by the
constitution, to Parliament president Nikolai Todorov, BTA said.
   ``The Bulgarian economy is in a general crisis ... the shortage
of all basic (commodities) is growing,'' BTA quoted Lukanov as
telling Parliament in a speech.
   ``The internal (trade) imbalance has become so acute now that
the country's market is actually threatened by disintegration,''
the former premier said.
   Lukanov cited a drop in industrial output by 9.3 percent this
year, surpassing an expected decrease of 5 percent.
   ``The cause for the crisis is the command ... neo-Stalinist
model of development and management in the field of economy,'' that
was in force for four decades, he said.
   Zhelev, a 55-year-old philosopher turned politician, was elected
president Aug. 1.
   Zhelev, who led the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF)
in June's free elections, was a compromise candidate for president
backed by all parties, including Socialist leaders.
   He has called for a ``strong, competent government'' that
presumably could include opposition members.
   With the backing of the UDF, which has 144 parliamentary seats,
the opposition could block key constitutional reforms, which need a
two-thirds majority for approval. The Socialists have 211 seats in
the 400-member Grand National Assembly.
   The opposition repeatedly has rejected offers of a coalition
from Lukanov, arguing that the former Communist Party must shoulder
responsibility for past political crimes and the rapidly
deteriorating economy.
   In a nationwide TV address Sunday, Zhelev called on political
parties in Parliament to form a council with him in a bid to solve
a deepening economic crisis.
   ``The crisis is worsening, the state coffers are empty ... there
are raw materials and energy shortages in industry, prices are
galloping, the unemployment rate is growing,'' Zhelev said.
   Bulgaria has stopped paying either capital or interest on its
foreign debt of nearly $11 billion.
   The daily Svoboden Narod reported Tuesday that Bulgaria, a
country of just under 9 million people, will be 1 million tons
short of grain this year. Rationing already has been introduced in
some towns for sugar, detergent and soap, and long lines form in
Sofia for many basic consumer items.

   A Peace Corps worker held captive for 50
days in the jungles of the Philippines returned home Tuesday to
Wyoming, steak and rhubarb pie.
   ``I'm glad to see you,'' Tim Swanson said as he bear-hugged his
mother, Lynne Swanson, at the end of his 24-hour trip from Manila
to Cheyenne.
   The 26-year-old was freed by New People's Army insurgents last
Thursday after the Philippine military agreed to a three-day truce.
Released to members of the International Red Cross, Swanson was
taken to the U.S. embassy in Manila where he was checked by doctors
and met with Peace Corps officials.
   Swanson, who admitted to feeling overwhelmed to be back in
Wyoming, didn't think long when asked how he planned to celebrate.
   ``I guess I want to eat the steak and the rhubarb pie that my
mother told me about and get some sleep,'' he said.
   Swanson considers the Philippines his home now, but he's not
sure when he'll return or what he'll do when he gets there. He
won't go back to the Peace Corps and his Filipino wife, Merle, is
on leave from her teaching job.
   Swanson said his brief foray into the forefront of international
politics was not welcome.
   ``I resented it,'' he said. ``I didn't like being used as a pawn
by the NPA.''
   He was kidnapped on June 13th, when three rebels came to his
home and insisted he come with them. Swanson said he had limited
freedom in the jungle hideout near his Philippine home of Patag,
but for the most part had little to do but sit and wait.
   The United States suspended Peace Corps operations in the
Philippines on June 27 and sent volunteers home because of alleged
reports that rebels planned to target them. U.S. officials said
they were unaware of Swanson's kidnapping when the order was issued.

<HEAD>Officials: Talks On Ending White Rule Could Begin Early Next Year</HEAD>

   Government officials say talks
with the African National Congress on ending white-minority rule
could begin by early next year now that the ANC has suspended its
guerrilla campaign, a news report said Tuesday.
   The independent South African Press Association quoted
unidentified government officials as saying the ANC's announcement
that it was halting its armed struggle meant formal constitutional
negotiations could begin by early 1991.
   ``This indicates their (the ANC's) seriousness to take to the
road of negotiation, and their subtlety and realism,'' one official
was quoted as saying.
   Early Tuesday, the government and the ANC released a joint
statement in which the anti-apartheid group announced it was
suspending its guerrilla campaign. The statement followed 16 hours
of talks between delegations headed by President F.W. de Klerk and
ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela.
   Joe Slovo, a senior ANC official, told a news conference that
the organization agreed to end its armed struggle so the government
could begin talks on sharing power with the black majority.
   ``We came here to break the logjam in the peace process, and I
believe we walked away with complete success in that direction,''
he said.
   But Slovo said the ANC reserved the right to resume armed
actions ``should the government fail to carry out its
undertakings.''
   Mandela said the ANC was making every effort to notify
supporters to end all armed action against the government
immediately.
   The joint statement by the government and the ANC said both
sides had reached ``a milestone on the road to true peace and
prosperity for our country.''
   It said, ``The way is now open to proceed towards negotiations
on a new constitution.''
   But the agreement did not halt protests.
   In Worcester outside Cape Town, police used teargas and rubber
bullets on Tuesday to break up an illegal protest march by about
2,000 residents of a mixed race suburb. No serious injuries were
reported.
   Police said Tuesday at least 15 blacks had been killed in
scattered factional fighting around the country since Sunday. The
dead included 11 killed in Kagiso outside Johannesburg in a power
struggle between ANC supporters and Inkatha, the conservative Zulu
political movement, police said.
   The government and the ANC have been trying since May to remove
obstacles to full-scale constitutional talks on ending white rule.
   Although the ANC's guerrilla wing, Spear of the Nation, has
launched no major attacks in the past year, ANC officials have
acknowledged that guerrillas were continuing to infiltrate the
country, stockpile weapons and plan attacks.
   Mandela had resisted declaring a cease-fire, saying the
government must make concessions. The ANC demanded that the
government release hundreds of political prisoners, grant amnesty
to about 20,000 exiles, remove laws restricting political activity
and end the state of emergency in Natal province.
   Tuesday's statement indicated the government had gone some way
towards meeting the ANC demands, but stopped short of outright
acceptance. Further discussion of the issues will take place.
   The joint statement said the government would consider repealing
some security laws and lifting the state of emergency in Natal,
which gives police wide powers to detain people and restrict
political activity.
   Both sides also agreed to draw up plans for the release of
ANC-connected prisoners and for granting amnesty to many of the
exiles who want to return home.
   De Klerk has been under pressure to secure major concessions
from the ANC after he legalized black opposition groups and freed
Mandela last February after 27 years in jail. White critics had
charged the government failed to gain anything by its concessions.

   Here, at a glance, are principal
characteristics of U.S. warplanes reported to be sent to Saudi
Arabia or known to be at nearby bases or aboard aircraft carriers
in the region.
   The characteristics are taken from various volumes of ``Jane's
All the World's Aircraft'' of recent years, and generally apply to
the most numerous model.
   For some planes, ``combat radius'' is reported; this is the
distance the plane can fly, loaded with weapons for combat and
return to base after fighting. For other planes, only ``range'' was
given, and this is the longest possible one-way flight with maximum
fuel. Combat radius would be less than half this distance because
the weapons load would degrade performance and might replace some
of the fuel.
   Numbers in service are taken from ``The Military Balance
1989-1990,'' published by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies in London. These do not include aircraft stored.

   A Marine force sailed Tuesday for Liberia, ships and jet
fighters set out from East Coast bases for the Middle East and
combat troops readied to help defend Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush ordered American warplanes and ground forces to
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. A Pentagon source said the president had
ordered deployment of U.S. combat troops and warplanes to Saudi
Arabia to help protect the U.S.-aligned desert kingdom against Iraq.
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified
by name, said they expected Army units heading for Saudi Arabia to
include elements of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg,
N.C.; the 24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. and the
101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky., near Clarksville,
Tenn. The 82nd and the 101st make up the 18th Airborne Corps.
   The three divisions together would total about 44,800 soldiers,
if all elements of each division, including a Georgia National
Guard Brigade in the 24th, were assembled.
   Another source said the American GIs would be part of a
multinational force, a condition set by the Saudis. Capitol Hill
sources said Egypt and Morocco were joining the effort.
   Authorities at Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division,
refused to comment on reports that soldiers from the Fayetteville,
N.C., base had been dispatched to Saudi Arabia.
   The role of the airborne divisions would be to secure air bases,
so other troops, aircraft and equipment can be sent in to support
the ground forces, other sources said.
   Troops at Fort Bragg had been placed on alert, soldiers said.
Fayetteville radio station WKML reported that 82nd Airborne
soldiers were confined to their barracks and were updating wills
and power of attorney, a routine procedure before a deployment.
   Four Navy ships prepared to leave Norfolk, Va., for the
Mediterranean as part of a 10-ship group that had been scheduled to
sail for a six-month assignment. The group included the battleship
Wisconsin.
   In Florida, the aircraft carrier Saratoga and a flotilla of
destroyers and frigates steamed out of Mayport en route to the
Mediterranean. The Saratoga normally carries a crew of 7,730.
   The Saratoga, which Navy officials said was being deployed on a
normal six-month mission, was aqccompanied by the destroyers
Spruance and Sampson, the frigate Elmer Montgomery and the guided
missile cruiser Phillipine Sea.
   The mood aboard the Saratoga was ``professional and
work-oriented but concerned,'' Chief Petty Officer Charles
Underwood, a spokesman for the Mayport Naval Station, said before
departure.
   The force of 2,500 Marines headed for Liberia left by ship from
Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. They had been previously scheduled
to relieve the Marine Expeditionary Unit that is stationed off the
coast of Liberia, where it rescued Americans during the weekend.
   The deployment was routine because the forces are rotated during
the year, but some Marines said they expected to be sent to the
Middle East.
   Col. W.C. Fite III, commander of the troops _ called the 26th
Marine Expedionary Unit, said he hadn't gotten orders yet.
   ``We haven't been told about our future plans,'' Fite said
during a brief news conference as troops boarded ships. ``We have
plans to go to Spain, which is routine, and also plans if needed to
go to the coast of Monrovia, Liberia.''
   The Marines sailed aboard a five-ship squadron.

   Egypt and Morocco were the first nations to commit troops to the
multinational military force led by the United States to protect
Saudi Arabia from possible Iraqi attack, Washington sources said
Tuesday.
   There were no reports of any Western European or other Arab
nations joining the force. Japan said it would not participate in
any such action.
   President Bush ordered U.S. troops and warplanes to the front
line of the explosive standoff, according to authoritative Pentagon
sources and sources on Capitol Hill. There was no announcement of
military moves from the White House.
   A source in Washington said U.S. troops would be part of a
multinational force, a condition set by the Saudis. U.S
congressional sources said Egypt and Morocco were joining the
effort.
   Saudi Arabia, sharing Arab sensitivities, had never before
agreed to stationing U.S. military power on its soil.
   Egypt is the second-largest recipient of U.S. economic and
military aid, with current annual aid level of $2.3 billion and a
large arsenal of U.S.-supplied weapons. Since 1981, the United
States has conducted joint maneuvers with Egypt involving several
thousand troops from each country every two years.
   Morocco's King Hassan II enjoys close relations with the United
States and receives millions of dollars a year in U.S. military
aid. The moderate Arab country has U.S.-made tanks.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said that the
country's no-war constitution would bar it from joining any
international military effort in the Persian Gulf.
   The West German Foreign Ministry also said there were no plans
for German troops to join a multinational force in the gulf. A duty
officer noted that the West German constitution bars the use of
German troops outside the country.
   Turkey, which closed Iraqi oil pipelines, had received no
request to join such a force, Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat
Sungar said.
   Two U.S. carrier battle groups were already on station in the
region _ the USS Independence and its 14 escorts in the Arabian Sea
at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and the force led by the USS
Eisenhower in the eastern Mediterranean.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in Egypt, persuaded Egyptian
officials to allow the Eisenhower to pass through the Suez Canal on
Tuesday night to move closer to the embattled gulf region, Pentagon
sources said.
   A handful of British and French navy vessels were also in the
region. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said a Soviet
anti-submarine ship and destroyer were dispatched from the Indian
Ocean toward the area, but only to ``ensure safety of navigation of
Soviet civilian vessels.''
   Diplomats said the U.N. Security Council resolution calling for
a worldwide boycott against Iraq could be used as justification by
the United States and other nations to act unilaterally, or in
concert apart from the United Nations, to enforce the boycott.
   There was hope that a multinational defense of Saudi Arabia
would deter Saddam Hussein's million-man Iraqi army from storming
the Saudi oil fields. Iraqi forces conquered Kuwait last week.
Saudi Arabia borders Kuwait and also has a common border with Iraq.
   Secretary of State James Baker made plans to meet Friday in
Brussels with the foreign ministers of the 15 U.S. allies in Europe
after a quick consultation trip to Turkey. The move appeared to be
an effort to enlist Western Europe in the Saudi defense effort.

   Neighborhoods across the country took a
stand against crime and celebrated safety Tuesday night with block
parties, candlelight marches and flashing lights in the seventh
annual National Night Out.
   ``The block is running over with people,'' said Barbara Landers,
who held a block party in the Philadelphia's Hunting Park
neighborhood. ``The kids are out here playing, they helped decorate
the street. We're all having fun here tonight. The block is out!''
   In Charleston, W.Va., at least 25 neighborhood groups held
rallies, cookouts, marches and block parties. Among the events was
a senior citizens' march with flashlights around their highrise
apartment complex, said Sgt. Dallas Staples.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police coordinated the activities of 194
community block watches, said the police department's Howard Wilson.
   In Barrow, Alaska, police officer Brent Robles said timing just
wasn't right. Barrow gets just a couple hours of semi-darkness at
this time of year.
   ``We're going to do it when we get a night,'' said Robles.
   National Night Out ``turns the clock back about 40 years to a
time when communities were safer because people knew their
neighbors, routinely looked out for one another, and everyone knew
the cop on the beat,'' said organizer Matt Peskin.
   Peskin is director of the National Association of Town Watch, a
non-profit organization based in this Philadelphia suburb. It is
dedicated to the development of law-nforcement affiliated crime and
drug prevention activities.
   About 400 communities participated in the first Night Out
through their local Town Watch groups in 1984, Peskin said. This
year, he was looking for a turnout of 21 million in 8,000
communities in all 50 states and in Canada and at U.S. military
bases around the world.
   Last year, police in Dayton, Ohio, gave out mock citations and
light bulbs to people who didn't have their outside lights on.
   This year, the Night Out ceremonies began at noon, with a
``Hands Across the Border'' trek from Fort Erie, Ont., to Buffalo,
N.Y., for 300 police and members of citizens groups.
   ``What we're trying to show is crime doesn't have any
boundaries,'' said Buffalo police Lt. Ron Christopher after more
than 100 police officials from New York state and Canada staged an
afternoon motorcade across the international Peace bridge from
Buffalo to Fort Erie, Ontario.
   In New York City, Mayor David Dinkins urged citizens to join the
fight against crime, saying public safety is ``my highest priority,
but I can't do it alone.''
   ``I'm not calling for you to become vigilantes, but I am
preaching vigilance,'' said Dinkins, speaking to about 250 people
in Harlem.
   Night Out organizers in Butte, Mont., said they would light up
the 90-foot ``Lady of the Rockies'' statue atop the continental
divide. Milwaukee, the leading city in the celebration last year,
planned 1,000 block parties and security lighting demonstrations.
   Most important, Peskin said, is the way the Night Out draws
people together and gets them in touch with the police.
   ``You have police in the neighborhood and nothing's wrong,'' he
said. ``It's a rare chance, especially for the kids. The event
seems to draw out neighborhoods that have usually been tough to
involve in anything.
   ``Generally, most people are law-abiding and they want to be
neighborly,'' Peskin said. ``But nowadays, if you try to be
neighborly, many people are likely to be suspicious. You can do
that on this night.''

   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, says he
thinks a subcommittee he chairs has established the legal basis to
overturn a 1988 savings and loan bailout he describes as ``very
sweet.''
   Arizona insurance executive James M. Fail acknowledged on Monday
there were inaccuracies and omissions in disclosure statements he
signed before acquiring 15 failed thrifts, now operating under the
name Bluebonnet Savings Bank, Dallas.
   One of the penalties for improper disclosure is removal as S&amp;L
owner.
   ``I believe there is enough to reopen and renegotiate the
contract. The real issue is can we save the taxpayers millions and
possibly billions of dollars. I believe the answer is yes,''
Metzenbaum told reporters after an all-day session of his Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust.

   The American Bar Association is demonstrating how
deeply divided it is over taking a public stand on abortion, and
the future of its pro-choice policy remains in doubt.
   By a vote of 885-836 Monday, members at the ABA's Assembly
meeting adopted a resolution that supporters say is designed to
restore the nation's largest lawyers' group to a position of
neutrality on abortion.
   ``Questions presented by a decision to terminate pregnancy are
extremely divisive,'' the resolution said. ``The ABA for the good
of the association will not adopt a policy supportive of a
particular viewpoint.''
   The resolution urged repeal of a pro-abortion-rights stand
adopted by the ABA's policymaking body, its House of Delegates.

   A bodyguard has been convicted in the
slayings of two American tourists he mistook for U.S. agents after
they wandered into a restaurant celebration by Mexican drug
traffickers.
   Monday's verdict against Javier Vasquez Velasco was the last in
the latest trial over the slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena. The case has strained U.S. relations with Mexico and
entangled more than 40 people in the two countries.
   Vasquez, 38, portrayed by federal prosecutors as a drug lord's
bodyguard, was convicted of two counts of violent crimes in aid of
racketeering in the 1985 slayings of John Walker and Alberto
Radelat in a Guadalajara restaurant.
   Prosecutors said Walker and Radelat were mistaken for drug
agents after they wandered into a party for drug kingpins.

least one case pizzas, to get movie rentals back on track.
   Film-savvy clerks, easier-to-find titles, candy counters, video

consult with those at home regarding second choices are among the
perks being offered to keep the customer satisfied, participants at
an industry convention say.
   ``Going to the video store is no longer fun,'' said Robert

   In a glum keynote address at the ninth annual Video Software

   The mother of a defendant in the Central Park
jogger trial was thrown out of court after shouting in front of the
jury that her 16-year-old son had passed a lie detector test.
   Sharonne Salaam's outburst Monday came as a prosecutor testified
about the night her son, Yusef Salaam, was picked up by police last
year.
   Mrs. Salaam leapt from her chair and accused the witness,
Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, of lying about a
conversation they had at a precinct house about Salaam's age.
   ``Why are you telling all these lies? My son is innocent! You
don't have to lie like that! He passed a lie detector test and he's
innocent!'' Mrs. Salaam shouted at Fairstein, the final witness in
the trial. Two court officers escorted Mrs. Salaam from the
courtroom.

   Today is Friday, Aug. 10, the 222nd day of 1990. There are 143
days left in the year.
   
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Aug. 10, 1846, Congress chartered the Smithsonian
Institution, named after English scientist Joseph Smithson, whose
bequest of $500,000 made it possible.
   
   On this date:
   In 1792, mobs in Paris attacked the palace of Louis XVI.
   In 1809, Ecuador struck its first blow for independence from
Spain.
   In 1821, Missouri became the 24th state.
   In 1874, Herbert Clark Hoover, the 31st president of the United
States, was born in West Branch, Iowa.
   In 1885, Leo Daft opened America's first commercially operated
electric streetcar, in Baltimore.
   In 1921, Franklin D. Roosevelt was stricken with polio while at
his summer home on the Canadian island of Campobello.
   In 1945, during World War II, Japan announced its willingness to
surrender to the Allies provided the status of Emperor Hirohito
remained unchanged.
   In 1948, Allen Funt's ``Candid Camera'' made its television
debut on ABC under the title ``Candid Microphone,'' which was also
the name of a radio program produced by Funt.
   In 1949, the National Military Establishment was renamed the
Department of Defense.
   In 1969, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were murdered in their Los
Angeles home by members of Charles Manson's cult, one day after
actress Sharon Tate and four other people were slain.
   In 1975, television personality David Frost announced he had
purchased the exclusive rights to interview former President Nixon.
   In 1977, postal employee David Berkowitz was arrested in
Yonkers, N.Y., accused of being ``Son of Sam,'' the gunman whose
yearlong series of six murders and seven woundings terrorized New
Yorkers.
   In 1984, the women's 3,000-meter race at the Los Angeles
Olympics ended for Mary Decker of the U.S. when she fell after
colliding with South African-born Zola Budd. The race was won by
Romanian Maricica Puica. In 1988, President Reagan signed a measure
providing $20,000 payments to Japanese-Americans who were interned
during World War II.
   
   Ten years ago: The day before the start of the Democratic
national convention in New York, President Carter agreed to
compromise with Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy on economic
policies contained in the party platform.
   Five years ago: In South Africa, relative calm returned to
Durban's black and Indian townships, where days of rioting had
claimed dozens of lives.
   One year ago: Poland's Roman Catholic church suspended an
agreement to move nuns from a convent on the edge of Auschwitz,
blaming Jewish groups for creating what it called an ``atmosphere
of aggressive demands.''
   
   Today's Birthdays: Actress Rhonda Fleming is 67. Singer Jimmy
Dean is 62. Singer Eddie Fisher is 62. Rock musician Ian Anderson
is 43. Singer Patti Austin is 42. Actress Rosanna Arquette is 31.
   
   Thought for Today: ``A man may fulfill the object of his
existence by asking a question he cannot answer, and attempting a
task he cannot achieve.'' _Oliver Wendell Holmes, American author
(1809-1894).

<HEAD>`I'm Dangerous Tonight' _ Not Really, But It's A Fine B Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Remember how much fun it was to stay up too late
on a Saturday night with popcorn and orange soda pop and wait
expectantly for the Late Nite Shriek Theater Shock Horror Creature
Feature?
   ``I'm Dangerous Tonight,'' airing tonight on cable's USA
Network, is just like those good old B movies. It doesn't pretend
to be Great Art, just a nice, scary movie that is suitable for
middle-school viewers.
   It means, also, that the movie is not quite that scary for
grownups.
   Don't blame director Tobe Hooper (``Poltergeist'' and ``Texas
Chainsaw Massacre''), who makes the most of the slenderest of
premises:
   ``A cloak used in early Aztec blood sacrifices which transmits
forbidding, evil, supernatural powers to unwitting victims who come
in contact with it.''
   The opening credits for ``I'm Dangerous Tonight'' run while a
big tractor-trailer rig rolls into view and onto the campus of good
old State U.
   ``I got a delivery for Dr. Jonas Wilson,'' the surly, Latin
American-accented driver tells the security guard and forklifts in
a huge, stone Aztec-symbol inscribed whatchamacallit.
   ``What the heck is that?'' asks the security guard.
   ``It's an Aztec sacrificial altar,'' the driver says, having
readahead in the script. ``During important festivals they say the
blood ran from this altar in rivers. ... Your professor should be
pleased with it.''
   Enter the professor. Ooh, he's pleased. His fingertips twitch
greedily as he moves to touch the profane altar.
   ``Hey, professor, some sacrificial altar, eh?'' says the
security guard.
   A line reading as stupid as that, kids, automatically moves the
security guard onto the list of Minor Characters About to be
Scragged Horribly.
   The professor caresses the stone as he waxes rhapsodic about the
ancient Corn Festivals where the Aztec priests who sacrifice 20,000
victims a day. His eyes get misty as he says `` ... their hearts
torn from their living bodies.''
   Then our professor friend OPENS the altar and inside is ...
``AAAAAAAAAAGH!!!''
   Scared ya, huh?
   You get the picture. Hooper moves the teleplay of producers
Bruce Lansbury and Philip John Taylor as steadily as a sine wave,
pacing the thrills and the lulls as dependably as a train schedule.
   All too soon the cloak comes into the possession of Amy (the
oddly lovely ``Twin Peaks'' regular Madchen Amick), a worthy,
Cinderella-type freshman at State U. who falls under the cloak's
spell and makes an evening dress of it.
   She is transformed into a sensual, man-hungry vamp ... just as
long as she's wearing the dress. This causes some understandable
confusion for the lad who removes her from it during a friendly
embrace at the college dance.
   Ah, but there's still plenty of confusion, mayhem, and murder
ahead, kids.
   R. Lee Emery (remember the tough DI in ``Full Metal Jacket''?)
turns in his usual superlative performance as a police detective
investigating what has become a string of homicides.
   He is a surprisingly competent policeman and not at all typical
of the scary movie genre. ``Losing a relative is a tragedy,'' he
tells one potential victim, ``but losing two in two days is
downright careless.''
   Anthony Perkins, who's becoming known as a great cable
television actor, phones in his role as an archaeology professor,
and Dee Wallace-Stone (``Cujo'') puts in late-innings relief as a
cloak victim-cum-perpetrator.
   ``I'm Dangerous Tonight'' is well-directed even it it isn't
particlarly well-written. Director Hooper creates some scary images
and is still prodding the material for thrills even when the script
has run out of steam.

   Elswewhere in television ...
   SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL DEPT.: You'll probably find yourself
wishing for better things for the cast, should you tune in
tonight's special preview of of ABC's sitcom ``New Attitude.''
   Sheryl Lee Ralph and Phyllis Yvonne Stickney star as two sisters
who've sunk their life savings into a beauty salon where ... WAIT
for it ... ``the sets, perms and rinses often take a back seat to
their misadventures.''
   Drat. If you were hoping for a black version of ``Steel
Magnolias,'' you'll be disappointed.
   Miss Ralph plays the down-to-earth one and Miss Stickney the
wild and impulsive one. They convey warmth in their relationship
despite the snappy patter. Morris Day does a nice job as a
self-absorbed hairdresser.
   Sadly, that's about as far as it goes. The show is underwritten,
its comedic situations lack a sense of risk or danger and its
characters are thin.
   We're still waiting for an comedy about black women that can
entertain us without patronizing us and wasting the talents of
performers like Miss Stickney, who was in ``The Women of Brewster
Place'' miniseries, and Miss Ralph of ``The Mighty Quinn'' movie
and Broadway's ``Dream Girls.''

<HEAD>ANOTHER LOOK: Monument Avenue, 100 Years Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZINIE CHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Southerners look at Monument Avenue's
stately statues of Confederate heroes and see ``the most beautiful
street in America.'' Some Northerners look at the same scene and
see ``Losers' Lane.''
   Norrece T. Jones Jr. looks out on the statue of J.E.B. Stuart
from his apartment, and he sees human suffering.
   ``When I see those monuments, I think of people who enslaved
African Americans. I can never look at them dispassionately or
indifferently,'' says Jones, professor of Afro-American history at
Virginia Commonwealth University.
   One hundred years after Robert E. Lee became the first son of
the South to be memorialized on Monument Avenue, the 140-foot-wide
thoroughfare symbolizes both the scars of slavery and the elegance
of a time long ago.
   It is ``more than a Confederate Valhalla,'' says Edwin J. Slipek
Jr., director of the avenue's centennial celebration. ``It's a
linear Central Park or town square, tracking the development of an
American city.''
   The 62-foot-tall statue of Lee on his horse was dedicated on
Memorial Day in 1890. Jeb Stuart and Jefferson Davis followed up in
1907, Stonewall Jackson in 1919 and Matthew Fontaine Maury,
``Pathfinder of the Sea,'' in 1927.
   By the 1920s, Monument Avenue was Richmond's most prestigious
address. Douglas Southall Freeman, the Richmond historian whose
writing about Lee won the Pulitzer Prize, doffed his hat whenever
he passed ``Marse Lee.''
   ``They didn't start out by saying, `We're going to dedicate a
street to the men who lost the Civil War,'' said Robert Winthrop,
an architectural historian.
   Instead, the row of statues grew ``piece by piece,'' he said.
``If the city government was focused on a memorial to the Lost
Cause it might be different.''
   George Callcott, professor of Southern history at the University
of Maryland, said: ``One of the things American historians have
noticed is the South's preoccupation with the past. Monument Avenue
is an indicator of that.''
   John Zehmer, executive director of the Historic Richmond
Foundation, is among those who suggest Monument Avenue is not so
much a commemoration of Confederate heroes as a display of fine art.
   Still, when other statues were proposed through the years _
non-Civil War types like Thomas Jefferson, Woodrow Wilson, William
Henry Harrison and Edgar Allan Poe, among them _ none was built.
   In the late 1970s, when Richmond first elected a city council
with a black majority, the outgoing administration feared that
blacks would move or tear down the Lee monument. So the whites
deeded Robert E. Lee to the state.
   But Henry Marsh, the city's first black mayor, laid a wreath at
the Jefferson Davis monument, assuring the United Daughters of the
Confederacy that he was ``mayor of all the city.''
   ``The city had never experienced what they perceived as black
control and didn't know what to expect,'' Marsh said. The avenue,
he says today, is ``one of the great boulevards in the world.''
   Monument Avenue is a haven to joggers and children who frolic on
the grassy, tree-lined median. It is an avenue of mansions _ the
average home is 5,000 square feet, with a half-dozen fireplaces,
four bathrooms, maids quarters, and a dozen rooms on three floors.
   Some of the houses have been sold to new owners who find them
too large to handle and turn them into offices and apartments.
   Some have been purchased by newcomers eager to buy a mansion for
a relatively cheap price; Ceci Amrhein, a real estate broker who is
also co-chairwoman of the centennial, said a house in need of major
renovation is on the market for $250,000, while another, fully
renovated, sold for $775,000.
   The centennial has had its goofy side, including a croquet
festival, billed at ``the world's largest croquet match,'' on the
avenue's lawns.
   But when, as part of the celebration, a jazz group was invited
to play, black youths in the band refused to perform under the
statue of Lee, Jones said. The band moved the show a block away.
   ``The Civil War, in essence, was fought to preserve a certain
culture _ that culture predicated on the enslavement of hundreds of
thousands of African Americans,'' Jones said.
   Though he can look out of his window and see the statue of
Stuart, renowned as one of the best cavalry commanders of the Army
of Northern Virginia, Jones says he enjoys living there.
   The building in which he lives, designed by architect William
Lawrence Bottomley, is on the Virginia Historic Register and the
National Register of Historic Places. He enjoys the model of a
Claes Oldenburg sculpture on a neighbor's lawn _ the sculpture
depicts not a war hero, but a clothespin.
   And there have been signs of change. The Virginia chapter of the
American Institute of Architects held a mock competition for a new
sculpture on Monument Avenue, and drew responses from 250
architecture students.
   The most popular subject? Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the
first black elected chief executive of any state.

<HEAD>Templeton: The Profits Belong To The Steady Investor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are times that test investors and separate
them from traders, guessers, speculators, and crowd and guru
followers.
   Investors think long-term, absorbing and measuring the daily and
monthly events against their basic analysis of sales and earnings
possibilities. Good investors maintain a distant view. They tend
not to panic.
   Sir John Templeton expresses the philosophy this way: ``The
short term _ the next month or year _ depends very heavily on human
emotions. The long term, however, depends on values _ and values
keep rising.''
   That is, the value of well-chosen investments grow. They grow
because the economies of which they are a part grow, because their
markets are expanding, because they are well managed.
   Templeton, based in Nassau, Bahamas, is one of the most
successful investors of all time, a living legend, a knight, a
founder of mutual funds in which 700,000 investors own shares.
   There have been seven bear markets since Templeton founded the
Templeton Growth Fund in 1954. But in that time, a $10,000
investment would have grown to well over $1 million, after payment
of all fees and expenses.
   Ask Templeton about short-term events and how to deal with them
and he might say, as he said to Steven Halpern, ``Your guess is as
good as mine.''
   Templeton recently told Halpern, editor of a stock market
newsletter, that ``We have been investment counselors for 58 years,
and in all that time we have never been able to tell our clients
when a bear market will start or stop.''
   Rather than trying to forecast, Templeton buys shares selling at
a low price in relation to long-term prospects. In that way, he
said, he can produce better long-term results than if he had tried
to forecast the market.
   Overall, and in spite of bear markets and unforeseen events, he
observes, stock prices have doubled about every 10 years throughout
the history of American markets.
   ``As a result, if you invest over a period of one or two full
stock market cycles, we believe you'll come out a winner,'' he told
Halpern, who produces the Dick Davis Digest, a compilation of views
from 400 advisory services.
   During those cycles, he suggests, you might consider bear
markets not to be a catastrophe, a reason to sell or to drop out of
the market, but as an opportunity, a chance to buy at a relatively
low price.
   The significance of Templeton's words is obvious these days,
when nervous stockholders call their brokers every hour, when gloom
is pervasive, when fears of a collapse are rampant, when short-term
events cloud long-term perspectives.
   It takes conviction to stand firm, of course, and not everyone
can do it. Some people bend under the onslaught of negative news
and views. Others are compelled to sell because they need the money.
   But those who can hold out during negative times, says
Templeton, are likely to be as well rewarded in the future as they
have been in the past.
   Maybe even more so, he said.

<TEXT>
   Lindiwe Phillip, an
anti-apartheid activist, fled into exile and expected to return
triumphantly in a few months. That was 14 years ago.
   She came home in June, when the government granted temporary
amnesty to dozens of African National Congress leaders so they
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid, the racial
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nation's 28
million blacks.
   Ms. Phillip, now 32, was among thousands of young blacks who
left after the the 1976 student uprisings. Hundreds of people were
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of
militant activists.
   ``I thought (exile) would be very temporary, about three
months,'' she said. ``As time went on, I had to grapple with the
fact that I am in exile and that I can no longer go home.''
   The ANC, South Africa's leading black opposition movement, has
an estimated 20,000 members in exile. The ANC and the government
agreed Monday to clear the way for their return, starting in
September.
   While Ms. Phillip was in exile in Zambia, her parents died.
After she was in touch with her brother about the deaths, he was
killed, and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death.
She still does not know who killed either of them.
   ``I was just heartbroken,'' she said. ``I was almost on the
verge of going nuts, crazy.''
   During her exile, Ms. Phillip received military training and
studied in Cuba and Tanzania. She also worked in the ANC Women's
Section and the Department of Information and Publicity in Lusaka,
Zambia, the ANC's exile headquarters.
   Her feelings were mixed when she returned in June with a group
sent to recruit members for the ANC Women's League.
   ``We had so longed to be back home, but at the same time we were
not sure it was the correct time,'' she said.
   African National Congress members began trickling out of South
Africa when the organization was banned in 1960.
   President F.W. de Klerk lifted the 30-year ban in February. A
law passed at that time empowers de Klerk to grant immunity, but so
far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen ANC leaders
and officials.
   Officials say that, under Monday's agreement, the cases of all
exiles will be reviewed and disputed cases will be handled by a
special commission.
   Mathews Phosa, a lawyer on the ANC negotiating team, fled South
Africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger, but
had to leave his wife and 3-year-old daughter behind.
   ``It is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in
one's life, a very very painful experience _ shattering,
terrible,'' he said.
   What sustained exiles, Phosa said, was unshakeable belief in the
struggle to end apartheid.
   ``You don't know where you are going to exactly,'' he said.
``You are being uprooted from your loved ones. ... You know you are
going to comrades, but that's not enough. You still have to make
new friends.''
   After the initial shock, life in exile becomes normal, the
lawyer said: ``People get married, they fall in love, they work,
and home is not something that haunts you every day.''
   Finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles.
There is a severe shortage of housing for blacks.
   Many will want to catch up on education they missed while
fighting for Spear of the Nation, the ANC military wing, but black
schools are overcrowded, qualified teachers are rare and violence
has disrupted classes for years.
   Recent right-wing violence against blacks and against whites
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles,
Phosa said, ``but that can't be a reason for us not to come home.''
   With ``the political space being there to organize and build our
organization, it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our
cadres inside the country,'' he said.
   ``I think I am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling
blocks. There is a willingness on the part of the government. They
are very slow ... hesitant, but I think they are moving forward and
they should be credited for that.''

   Gertrude Rainey lives in a Harlem neighborhood
scarred by boarded-up brick apartment buildings and the effects of
drugs, but her half-acre vegetable and flower garden thrives among
the ruins.
   ``The streets can separate you from life,'' she said. ``But this
garden lifts you up and the soil feels so good in your hands.''
   The concrete-and-steel maze of New York City contains many
colorful patches tended by people like Ms. Rainey, who garden to
soften the edge of city living.
   Urban children who didn't know where tomatoes came from are
dazzled by the plots, and tourists from around the world include
them on their itineraries.
   A group of gardeners called the Green Guerrillas began the
movement to make the city greener in 1972 by cleaning out empty
lots piled with trash and planting shrubs and flowers. The city
became involved in 1979 when it began Operation GreenThumb to help
pay for fencing, seeds and tools.
   Today, nearly 550 community gardens can be found on lots owned
by the city, and GreenThumb says the value of the fruit and
vegetables they yield amounts to $375,000 a year. There also are
many gardens on private lots.
   Gardens give people greater pride in their neighborhoods, said
Lisa Stephano, a spokeswoman for the American Community Garden
Association, based in Philadelphia. The national association claims
250 community garden programs nationwide as members, but estimates
there are nearly 1,000.
   ``We find that once a garden is developed, it takes over
people's lives,'' said Jane Weissman, director of Operation
GreenThumb. ``What they are really doing is throwing open their
doors, going down in their streets, meeting their neighbors and
creating an environment of safety with others.''
   Three years ago, John English was a jeweler on Wall Street.
Today, he owns a construction company he founded to stop a city
plan to pave over what is considered the city's first community
garden.
   English, 47, couldn't understand how developers' plans to widen
the sidewalk and put in shops and low- and middle-income housing
would improve the neighborhood more than the Liz Christy Garden. He
became an expert on housing to argue his case that the garden
should stay and that the homes should be built elsewhere.
   English won, and the graceful garden still gives the feel of the
backyard of a country estate. Only it's on Houston Street, a main
thoroughfare pounded day and night by trucks and cabs.
   ``A garden is part of the soul. Without the cycles of life, one
loses track of reality,'' he said. ``So to me, this is real in a
city which is surreal.''
   The noise of clattering trucks fades in the tranquility of the
garden, but the syringes and other trash tossed over the fence are
a reminder of the mean streets outside.
   All of the city-sponsored gardens must be opened to the public
at least once a week, and on a recent evening passers-by strolled
among the peach, apricot and plum trees while some of English's
employees barbecued lobster and corn and drank beer.
   ``This is my yard,'' he said.
   Teresa Civello, a neighborhood resident, calls the garden ``a
piece of heaven.''
   ``I walk by every morning and here, in the middle of this
desolate, miserable neighborhood, there is a little bit of hope,''
she said. ``It's always exciting and full of mystery.''
   The Green Guerrillas have a paid staff of four and 250
volunteers who share their technical expertise to help start new
gardens.
   The group helped Ms. Rainey landscape her garden in a lot that
had been a neighborhood dumping ground, full of discarded
appliances, trash and bricks from crumbled buildings. Now, there
are plots of greens, okra, string beans, cabbage and tomatoes,
surounded by zinnias, gladioluses and wild grass.
   Ms. Rainey, 61, has lived only in Miami and New York City. She
said she had to sit down in the dirt and get acquainted with it.
   Her friends see the garden as a neighborhood improvement
project, she said.
   ``Even the crackheads haven't bothered me,'' she said. ``They
come by and say, `Gert, it's looking good.'
   ``They sort of protect it. They wouldn't take so much as a
tomato.''
   But plant rustling is on the rise in the city, and many,
including GreenThumb's Ms. Weissman, blame addicts who sell flowers
and shrubs on the streets for fast cash. Landscapers also are
suspected of stealing plants. Some gardeners have begun chaining
bushes and anchoring trees to buried cinder blocks.
   Over in the Bronx, Geneva McFadden heard about Operation
GreenThumb about four years ago and, in one day, rounded up eight
neighbors she had never met and received approval for a garden from
the community board.
   They turned a lot that had been piled with burned-out cars and
trash into an idyllic patch in a noisy neighborhood of apartment
buildings and mini-markets.
   The garden is a mix of meticulous brick-lined flower beds of
roses, geraniums, petunias, marigolds and pink clover, and
wood-framed vegetable plots thick with healthy tomato plants,
cabbage and corn.
   ``People stop and comment _ white, black and Spanish _ so it
brings the neighborhood together,'' said Mrs. McFadden, 75, who
grew up on a farm in South Carolina. ``The kids stand there
looking. A lot of them have never seen flowers grow before.''
   Thousands of people walk by Randy Glaser's garden in Greenwich
Village each day to gaze through the chain-link fence at elegant
rosebushes, climbing trellises, neat vegetable plots and beds of
Johnny-jump-ups, delphinium and fire lillies.
   Many of the admirers are drawn as they leave a supermarket just
feet away.
   ``People are constantly stopping, asking questions, saying thank
you for the garden,'' Glaser said. ``They almost become poets _
some call it an oasis in a cement desert; some say they've changed
stores just to come by here.''
   ``It's like I've reunited with the earth, the world,'' Ms.
Rainey said recently as she sat under in the shade of a tree,
smoking a cigarette.
   ``You look out the window and see vacant buildings, homeless
people on TV, our children destroyed by drugs,'' she said. ``It's
all like a big sore festering and the garden takes your mind off
that.''

<HEAD>`Chinatown' Sequel Finally Makes It to Screen After 16 Years</HEAD>

   Jack Nicholson was philosophical as
he looked back on his strife-filled, five-year ordeal in making
``The Two Jakes,'' the long-awaited sequel to ``Chinatown.''
   ``It's like the Army: As soon as it's over, somehow it all
reduces down to a bunch of funny camp stories,'' he said.
   A mellowed-out Nicholson was holed up in a Beverly Hills Hotel
suite for a round of interviews to call attention to the release of
``The Two Jakes,'' in which he starred as well as directed. He had
just returned from New York, where he showed the film to a few
pals, including directors Mike Nichols, Bernardo Bertolucci and
Sidney Lumet. He thinks they liked it.
   ``The only way you can gauge your friends is when the lights
come up. Can they look at one another?'' he said. ``If they go like
this (glancing sideways), you know that back in their minds they're
saying, `How do I deal with this?' We've all been in that
situation.''
   The arrival of ``The Two Jakes'' climaxes a long and dramatic
history that began nearly two decades ago. Nicholson and
screenwriter Robert Towne, once classmates in Jeff Corey's acting
class, conceived a plan to make three films based on power and
corruption in earlier Los Angeles. ``Chinatown'' in 1974 was the
first of the trilogy.
   In 1985, Nicholson and Towne joined forces with producer Robert
Evans, who had been production head at Paramount Pictures when
``Chinatown'' was made, for ``The Two Jakes.'' Towne would direct,
and Evans, who hadn't acted in 25 years, would play Jake Berman,
enemy of Nicholson's detective Jake Gittes.
   Trouble in the partnership developed, Nicholson said because
Towne believed Evans wasn't right for such an important role, and
refused to proceed unless Evans was replaced. Harvey Keitel
eventually got the role, but the impasse led to the film's
cancellation.
   The triad was patched together enough to revive ``The Two
Jakes,'' and production began on April 18, 1989, with Nicholson
directing and receiving Directors Guild scale.
   Why did he assume the double duty?
   ``It kind of evolved that way,'' he explained. ``We had spent
quite a bit of money, the budget had been hammered down to minimal
_ not low-budget but good, astringent movie-making. There really
wasn't enough left to get Bertolucci, or Nichols, or Roman
(Polanski, who directed `Chinatown') or whoever we might have
wanted.
   ``Doing both has got to be one of the hardest jobs you can do.
... You're doing 20-hour days. There's no way around it. You got to
get the call, get to makeup, set up the shots; you're done at dark,
you got to travel, see the dailies, go home, shower, eat, learn the
lines for tomorrow, get the shots in your mind. By then it's 2-3
o'clock in the morning and you got to get up at 7 or 8 in order to
be on the set.
   ``There's no time to catch up, should you lose energy. Being a
hysterical person, I didn't lose much energy.''
   Nicholson's decade in the Roger Corman quickie factory helped
him make ``The Two Jakes'' on schedule and on budget (reportedly
$25 million, including hefty charges for the aborted version). His
lesson from the Corman days: ``That good and cheap is more creative
than good and expensive.''
   ``The Two Jakes'' was originally set for release last Christmas,
a deadline Nicholson considered unrealistic. There had been rumors
that preview audiences were confused by the complicated plot, hence
he added narration to help explain it.
   ``The narration is very philosophical; it's not plot,'' he said.
``Oddly, just the sense of `If we don't understand it, he'll tell
us' gave that security that I'm not sure I actually got in the rest
of the movie.''
   At the beginning of the interview, Nicholson was downing a
frothy, purplish drink which he has termed ``the elixir of life.''
It is part of the liquid diet that has helped him lose 30 excess
pounds he carried as Jake Gittes. He proudly displayed his new
figure. He also spoke proudly of his 4-month-old daughter, born to
Rebecca Brousard, who plays Gittes' secretary in ``The Two Jakes.''
   ``She's fantastic, a boon from divine nature,'' he exulted.
``Nothing's any better in life, as you know. When I see those big
cheeks, I gargle and google like the next guy. I feel very
blessed.''
   The romance with Brousard and the baby reportedly caused the
break in Nicholson's 17-year alliance with Anjelica Huston. He has
another daughter from his first and only marriage, to Sandra
Knight, another classmate at Jeff Corey's. She is Jennifer, 26, who
also worked on ``The Two Jakes'' as a design assistant.
   The only situation clouding Jack Nicholson's life at 53 concerns
the Los Angeles Lakers. He worries about rumored trades and lineup
changes. ``Magic (Johnson) is Magic, but he can't carry the whole
load himself,'' he commented. ``Otherwise Michael Jordan would win
the championship.
   ``But we'll have a representative team out there to watch. Only
for kids do you have to win the championship every year.''
   One thing is certain: Nicholson will be occupying his usual
courtside position when the Laker season begins. During his recent
trip to New York, he switched sports and attended a Yankees
baseball game. He was amused by the reaction.
   ``A bunch of people saw me, and like a moron, I stood up and
waved. Pandemonium broke out and the fans started chanting, `Jack!
Buy the Yanks!'
   ``I took $5 out of my pocket and waved it at them. All the
players were looking over and wondering what the hell was going
on,'' he said.
   ``You never know what's going to happen in life.''

   Growing up, Todd McFarlane was an indiscriminate
comic book addict.
   ``Anything that came out, I grabbed it,'' he says.
   Today the 29-year-old Canadian artist _ the man behind the new,
improved Spider-Man, has become the favorite of comic book
aficionados by remembering what caught his eye years ago.
   ``I still believe comic books are for kids,'' he says. ``I try
to put onto the pages all the things that I used to like when I was
growing up.''
   It's not only kids, though, who are captivated by McFarlane's
extraordinarily detailed, action-packed work.
   The first issue of his new Marvel Comics series, titled simply
``Spider-Man,'' quickly sold nearly 3 million copies this summer to
become the best-selling comic book in U.S. history.
   McFarlane, who garnered a huge following during the two years he
drew for the original title, ``Amazing Spider-Man,'' is both writer
and artist on the new series, the fifth to feature the wall-crawler.
   Maggie Thompson, co-editor of the Comics Buyer's Guide, a trade
journal based in Iola, Wis., credits the new book's success to,
``the combination of a popular character, a popular creator, a No.
1 (first issue) title and a couple of special editions that have
fanned the flames a little bit.''
   McFarlane was named favorite cover artist and favorite penciler
for the second year in a row in this summer's Comics Buyer's Guide
readers poll.
   In a telephone interview from his home and studio on Vancouver
Island, McFarlane said he went into comics after failing at his
first love: professional baseball. He attended Eastern Washington
University on a baseball scholarship, but majored in graphic design.
   After failing to make a Toronto Blue Jays minor league team, he
started sending out samples to comics companies, eventually landing
a job at Marvel working on ``The Incredible Hulk.''
   In 1988, he switched to ``Amazing Spider-Man'' and began the
webslinger's makeover, redesigning the costume and adding a
``creepier'' feel.
   ``I wanted to emphasize the `spider' in the word `Spider-Man,'''
he says. ``So I made his eyes a lot bigger to make them look like
bug eyes. He has webbing on his costume _ I made about five times
as much.''
   McFarlane also puts as much effort into the background as he
does the star.
   ``His style is extremely intricate,'' Thompson says. ``He
doesn't leave a large area blank because he's too lazy to draw it.''
   McFarlane also wants to give kids the same action and excitement
in comics that they get from such things as computer games and
adventure movies.
   ``I think that maybe I put a little more energy onto the page,''
he says. ``When somebody is getting slugged, they're flying across
the room, they're not just falling over. If somebody gets hit by a
ray gun or something, the guy is blasting.''
   The wisecracking wall-crawler took ``favorite character'' honors
this year in the Buyer's Guide poll, defeating Batman, the
titleholder since 1985.
   Spider-Man made his debut in 1962 as an unpopular, wimpish
teen-ager whose life changed forever when he was bitten by a
radioactive spider in a high school science lab. Today he's a
graduate student in biophysics who shares a SoHo loft with his
glamorous actress-model wife.
   The fact that Spider-Man continues to draw new generations into
his web doesn't surprise Stan Lee, the writer who created the
character with artist Steve Ditko.
   ``They like Spider-Man because they can relate to him,'' Lee
said. ``He worries about earning a living. He has domestic
problems. He has personal problems. He's as apt to get an ingrown
toenail or an allergy attack or worry about dandruff as anybody
else.''
   The character was conceived as an average kid who happens to get
super powers, in sharp contrast to the more established characters
such as Superman, who comes from outer space, and Batman, whose
alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is a multimillionaire.
   ``The original concept of Spider-Man _ the teen-ager who's
unpopular in school but has these secret powers and is someone to
be reckoned with _ feeds a lot of fantasies of a lot of people,''
Thompson says.
   Lee is now publisher at Marvel and at work on developing movie
projects, including a possible Spider-Man feature. He confesses to
a special love for his most popular creation and says McFarlane has
``a great take'' on the character.
   ``The toughest part of my job is trying to get as wide an
audience as possible,'' McFarlane says.
   ``You don't want to make it too simple, then you're going to
lose the 20-year-olds. But on the other hand, you don't want to
make it too funky or weird _ then you're going to lose the
10-year-old kids.''

   The leader of a movement that's pushing
record companies to ditch the cardboard packaging in which compact
discs are sold is claiming victory for his side.
   By the end of the year, a system will be in place to get rid of
the environmentally wasteful ``long boxes,'' says Robert Simonds,
chief financial officer of Rykodisc.
   ``Even the most vehement retailers would admit off the record
that the days of the long box are numbered,'' Simonds said. ``I
think what they're mostly fighting for now is to make sure they're
not stuck with the whole bill to pay for a new system.''
   His opponents don't quite share his optimism, but admit they're
looking for alternatives.
   In an industry that loves to show its public concern for the
environment and other causes, the controversy over the so-called
long boxes is making people squirm.
   Compact discs are generally packed into 5- by 6-inch plastic
``jewel boxes.'' In order to curtail theft and use more
eye-catching graphics, record companies wrap these containers in
6-by 12-inch cardboard boxes.
   When they buy a CD, most consumers simply tear the boxes apart
and throw them away.
   That doesn't make much sense to Simonds, who says the long boxes
are both a waste of money and waste of paper. His ``Ban the Box''
movement started with a letter published in Billboard magazine and
grew with the 20th anniversary celebration of Earth Day.
   Such musicians as R.E.M, Bobby McFerrin, the B-52s, Sting,
Rosanne Cash, Olivia Newton-John, the Grateful Dead and Crosby,
Stills and Nash have pledged their support.
   ``If consumers stop and think about the package, they will think
that it is kind of a pain in the neck,'' said Simonds, whose
company is based in Minneapolis. ``Then when they find out they're
paying up to a dollar or more per disc just for the package, then
they start getting angry. It's really struck a chord with
consumers.''
   Simonds stepped up the pressure in recent weeks by asking CD
purchasers to tear open the cardboard package in the music store
and dump it on the clerk's counter. The Tower Records chain, one of
the loudest opponents of ``Ban the Box,'' have put recycling bins
in some stores.
   Long boxes were created partly to enable retailers to place CDs
in bins once reserved for records, eliminating the need for a
costly change in how stores are set up as records replace CDs as
the music source of choice.
   The smaller package also lessens the chance of an ``impulse
buy'' from consumers attracted by colorful graphics, said Floyd
Glinert, head of the Entertainment Packaging Association, a group
of paper companies that supply the long boxes.
   ``It has replaced the record jacket as an art form, which is
very important to conveying to the public the excitement of a
record,'' he said.
   The United States is the only country that uses long boxes.
Getting rid of the boxes, retailers fear, will make them more
vulnerable to shoplifters.
   Despite all the talk about the environment, the issue now is
essentially economy. Record companies have changed their tune in
recent weeks _ instead of dismissing ``Ban the Box,'' they admit
they're seriously examining the criticisms.
   ``They're not thinking through what the alternatives are before
screaming `ban the box,''' said Paul Smith, president of CBS
Records distribution. ``There has to be some way of merchandising
the product. I think every record company in the business is
actively seeking an alternative to the 6-by-12 box.''
   Henry Droz, the president of WEA, told Billboard that his
company has no specific plans to abandon the long box, ``but I
don't know that we have a long-term commitment to keep it.''
   Although Simonds is the leader of ``Ban the Box,'' most of his
company's product _ particularly the popular CD reissues of old
David Bowie albums _ are offered with long boxes. That's because
some music chains have told him they won't sell the discs any other
way, he said. Simonds offers a discount to retailers who buy his
discs without the box.
   Despite all the environmentally conscious musicians jumping on
Simonds' bandwagon, it was Raffi, the Canadian singer of songs
written for pre-school youngsters, who blazed a trail. He was the
first to insist in a contract with his record company that his CDs
be marketed without long boxes.
   ``I simply believe that the excessive packaging of cassettes and
CDs can no longer be tolerated in a global environmental crisis,''
said Raffi, who's signed to MCA. ``If there's enough pressure from
artists and their audience, the buying public, I think record
stores will respond by eliminating the long box.''
   Rocker Joan Jett has asked CBS Records not to release her next
CD with a long box or, if the company can't, to not release the
album in a CD format at all. Smith said no decision has been made
on the request.
   A state senator from New York has proposed legislation banning
the long box from being marketed here. It's the first state to make
such a proposal, according to ``Ban the Box'' spokesman Martin
Folkman.
   Simonds suggested this country follow the Canadian record
industry's example when it banned the box. In Canada, record
companies contributed to a fund that helped retailers make their
improvements.
   ``Ban the Box'' has suggested various alternatives, including
new display cases built for jewel boxes and reusable plastic frames
that can be taken apart by a clerk. Many paper companies are trying
to come up with their own solutions, Glinert said.
   ``I sense that the major record companies are supportive of
getting rid of the long box but are in an awkward position of not
wanting to take that stand against their retail customers until
they're forced to,'' Simonds said. ``That would force them, if just
a few of their superstar artists throw us their support.''

   Hundreds of Chinese Jews Live in Old Imperial Capital
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KAIFENG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When residents of North and South
Scripture Lane see a foreigner wandering down their alley, they can
guess why.
   ``Are you looking for descendants of the Jews?'' asked an old
man sitting beside the dirt lane in his undershirt, and told the
visitor about Li, who lived a few streets away.
   He waved a hand toward where Zhao lived, but would not take the
stranger there. `He's not accepting visitors anymore,'' the old man
said. ``He's had too many.''
   Zhao Pingyu, 68, is one of a few hundred descendants of Jews
living in this ancient center of Judaism, 390 miles from Beijing in
Henan province.
   Kaifeng, the imperial capital from the 10th to the 13th century,
once was home to thousands of Jews, but they gradually became so
assimilated that little is left to distinguish them except their
memories and stories.
   In the 1980s, as China opened to the outside world, Kaifeng
officials sought to cash in on the mystique of Jews in China to
draw attract tourists. Their attitude appears to have changed since
the crackdown last year on ``bourgeois liberalism,'' the catch
phrase for Western ideas.
   When a New York family held a bat mitzvah in Kaifeng last month
for their daughter's coming of age, their requests for permission
to invite the local Jewish community were ignored.
   Zhao said the Kaifeng foreign affairs office had told him not to
receive foreigners except at official receptions, then he added:
``But if people come on their own to my house, how can I not invite
them in? That would be inhospitable.''
   Although neighbors are reluctant to take people to Zhao,
visitors have little trouble finding him. Zhao is well-known in
Kaifeng because he is one of the few Jews with knowledge of Jewish
history and culture.
   He lives with his wife, a non-Jew, in a large room at the back
of a courtyard on South Scripture Lane that once was part of the
synagogue compound.
   The synagogue was built in 1163 and stood for 700 years through
10 renovations. It eventually was destroyed by flooding from the
Yellow River, and the No. 4 People's Hospital now stands on the
site.
   Zhao has a diagram of the synagogue, which his
great-great-grandfather restored after retiring from an imperial
court office.
   A few years ago, after his own retirement from the tax bureau,
Zhao started building a model of the synagogue, which included
three elaborate worship halls and several side buildings. Much work
still remains.
   One of the three stone tablets displayed in Kaifeng's museum
exhibit on Jews in China came from Zhao's family. The tablets are
the Jews' best historical record.
   Jewish merchants arrived in China in the 7th century, joining
other traders on the journey along the Silk Road or by sea from
south India.
   Thousands settled in Kaifeng, eventually creating China's
largest Jewish community and the one that lasted longest. As
recently as 200 years ago, 2,000 to 3,000 Jews worshipped weekly in
the Kaifeng's synagogue.
   By the mid-19th century, the Jews had intermarried and become
assimilated. They adopted the customs of the majority Han Chinese
or the Moslems, forgot the Hebrew language and took Chinese names.
   A survey of Kaifeng in 1980 found only 79 Jewish families with
166 members. Other accounts say Kaifeng's population of 500,000
includes up to 300 descendants of Jews.
   Zhao and other Jews in the old imperial capital do not observe
Jewish rituals or holidays, but he remembers eating unleavened
bread for the Passover meal as a child. Many Chinese Jews observed
Passover during the Chinese Lunar New Year.
   Even though he does not practice Judaism, Zhao maintains his
sense of Jewish identity.
   ``When the Jews come here from foreign countries, I feel there's
some connection, some relationship by blood,'' he said. ``They're
our friends and our brothers.''
   A menorah given him by an American Jew is displayed in the
middle of Zhao's room, but he never uses the ceremonial
candleholder. A blue yarmulke, handmade by one of his daughters,
hangs on a wall.
   ``I have five daughters,'' he said. ``That's a good thing for a
Jew, because Judaism is passed down through the mother.''
   Zhao's household registration lists him as a Jew, but his new
citizen identification card says says he is Han Chinese.
   He said one daughter was so adamant about being Jewish that she
refused to get an identification card, because it would identify
her as Han Chinese.
   China has 54 minority groups. It does not recognize Jews as a
minority because they no longer have a language or customs to
distinguish them from Han Chinese.
   Moslems, who still practice their religion and have kept their
traditions, are China's second-largest minority. They have token
representation in government and the Communist Party and are
entitled to special treatment.

<HEAD>Pope Returns Hemisphere's First Book of Medicine to Mexico</HEAD>
<HEAD>By LAURA CASTANEDA</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Curanderos no longer recommend drinking
jaguar blood for strength, but the medicine men still use herbs to
induce abortions.
   The prescriptions and procedures are in the first known book of
medicine written in North or South America. The book has returned
to Mexico after more than 400 years, a gift of Pope John Paul II.
   ``It is very important because it provides a series of
prescriptions that allow us to study indigenous medicines,'' said
Dr. Carlos Viesca, a professor of history and medicine at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico.
   Viesca is the nation's leading authority on the 140-page book,
which bears the title ``Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis''
but is commonly known as the Badiano Manuscript.
   In it are lists of ailments, treatments used by central Mexico's
indigenous population and illustrations of 185 plants. Viesca said
modern-day curanderos still use 90 percent of the plants as
medicines.
   Martin de la Cruz, an Indian doctor at the College of Santa Cruz
at Tlatelolco, wrote the manuscript in the Nahuatl language in
1552, and Juan Badiano translated it into Latin. Little else is
known of the two men.
   Francisco de Mendoza, the son of New Spain's first viceroy,
commissioned the volume as a gift for King Charles I of Spain, who
eventually gave it to one of his librarians.
   It was sold to Cardinal Francisco Barberini of Rome, who kept it
until his death in 1902, then went to the Vatican library, to be
forgotten until two researchers disovered it 27 years later.
   Besides chronicling indigenous cures, Viesca said, the book
``could be used as a model to study traditional medicine to see how
much has been maintained, how much has been lost and how much has
been integrated'' into modern medicine.
   Some plants described in it have effective medicinal properties
and about 10 percent have been studied by modern scientists, he
said.
   Yolloxochetl, related to the magnolia, functions as a heart
stimulant much like the drug digitalis, Viesca said in an
interview. Cihuapatli has been found to induce labor, menstruation
and abortions.
   Many religious-magical aspects of the treatments have passed out
of vogue, he said.
   Before the Spanish came, curanderos called for divine
intervention and recommended feasting on the bones, bile, organs
and blood of animals. Viesca said jaguar blood was believed to
bring extraordinary physical strength.
   John Paul returned the book after President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari mentioned it during the pope's visit to Mexico in May.
   A copy is on display at the National Museum of Anthropology, but
the original is permanently stored to prevent further damage from
light or temperature variations.
   Viesca said the museum may publish an edition for public sale.

   ``Valmont'' (Orion. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   Filmmakers seem to have a love affair with Choderlos de Laclos'
1782 epistolary novel, ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.'' And with his
story of seduction, hedonism and revenge in 18th-century France,
it's no surprise.
   The work was first interpreted on film by Roger Vadim in 1959.
It starred Gerard Phillipe and Jeanne Moreau as two icy, modern-day
opportunists with an ``open marriage.'' It had a jazzy score by
Thelonius Monk and Jack Murray.
   The second movie version was 1988's ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' an
Americanized, fast-paced drama directed by Stephen Frears and
starring Glenn Close as the scheming Marquise de Merteuil and John
Malkovich as the notorious rake Valmont.
   Next comes Milos Forman's ``Valmont,'' a 1989 movie now
available on video. And it is as different from the other efforts
as the many interpretations of Shakespeare's ``Hamlet.'' It is a
lush and elegant movie, graced by the seductive camera work of
Miroslav Ondricek.
   With a keen eye for detail, Forman eases into de Laclos' story
against the blind morals of prerevolutionary France. His vision is
sweeping _ there's no rush but still much activity. Forman loves
the bustle and business of earlier times _ jugglers, merchants,
servants always underfoot.
   As Madame de Merteuil, Annette Bening brings a sugary
bitchiness. She is less brittle than the Glenn Close interpretation
and also less focused. But her intent is clear: She loves playing
games, wicked, vicious games that ultimately destroy people and
bring ruin to a way of life.
   Colin Firth's Valmont is far more attractive than Malkovich's.
Indeed, one wondered why women would ever be drawn to the Malkovich
character, with his pasty visage and deep-set eyes, and Bronx
sounding voice.
   Firth is almost too cute, almost too soft. And the steely
maliciousness is missing. Meg Tilly is convincing as a vulnerable
and pious young wife, a woman Valmontw orships and for whom he
lusts.
   Fairuza Balk (``Return to Oz'') portrays Cecile, the target of
Valmont's seduction and the innocent victim of Merteuil's revenge.
Her mother has arranged for the convent school girl to marry
Gercourt, an older man who will take only a virgin as his wife.
He's also Merteuil's ex-lover.
   Forman dances his characters about in a game of musical beds, a
game that's a no-win for just about all.
   Jean-Claude Carriere's screenplay makes good use of de Laclos'
focus on letter writing. Letters show up just about everywhere, and
even Valmont gets into the spirit by dictating erotic passages to
an unsuspecting Cecile to send to the young music teacher (Henry
Thomas) who loves her.
   As a video, ``Valmont'' is worth renting or buying as a
companion to other dangerous liaisons.

   ``Blaze'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Blaze'' is one of those warm, peppery movies that seem to work
better on the small screen and hence are a welcomed video find.
   Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long was a raunchy delight who believed
in good ol' boy politics and good time women in the 1950s-style
South. His affair with striptease dancer Blaze Starr created a
scandal that eventually led to his undoing.
   As Long, Paul Newman is a treat. He's brash and egocentric, a
womanizer who thinks nothing of having his mistress attend a formal
dinner party at the governor's mansion. He even wears his boots
when he engages in love-making.
   Lolita Davidovich is the voluptuous Blaze, a poor mountain girl
who leaves home to seek her fame and fortune with her guitar and a
few downhome songs. But it's not her singing the bar boys want. But
when Blaze gets into the strip business, she does it her way and in
her own style.
   As director, Ron Shelton creates the same feel in ``Blaze'' that
he had in ``Bull Durham.'' There's a nice touch to it all, and he
lets the story unravel on its own with just a dab of humor and
humanity.
   Watch this one.

   Turmoil in oil prices leaves no market
unaffected and throws a wrench into every stock forecast and
economic projection _ of gross national product, inflation,
interest rates _ made by government or private sages.
   There isn't a person who can say for sure, not even the
President or the Federal Reserve chairman, what the immediate
economic future holds, except to say that not one American is
immune from the effects.
   There isn't a single economist who can rely on his or her own
estimates of future activity, not one stock market guru from the
most conservative to the zaniest whose thinking hasn't been changed.
   Unless resolved quickly, the oil crisis has the potential to cut
half a percentage point or more from the gross national product
this year, which means it could be the difference between slow
growth and official recession.
   It forces the White House to reconsider fiscal strategies and it
compels the Federal Reserve to think again before moving against
inflation. It changes the dollar's trade value, the corporate
profits outlook, and the outlook for budget and balance-of-payments
deficits.
   For individuals, it means higher fuel oil prices, higher prices
for gasoline, higher ticket prices on airlines. It could mean
higher utility bills, and higher prices for almost any product you
can name. It could mean jobs.
   If the word ``vulnerable'' is overused generally, it is not in
regard to the developed world's dependency on oil. Japan imports
almost all its oil. The United States now imports nearly half, the
highest level ever. The health of Europe depends on a few pipes
running from the Mideast through Turkey.
   Compared with 1973, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries created the first big oil shortage and sent the entire
economy into a tailspin, the United States is even more vulnerable.
   U.S. domestic production has fallen. Alaska's oil output rose
steadily from the late 1970s through 1988. Last year, that state's
output dropped 7 percent, and the trans-Alaska pipeline has begun
to show signs of corrosion.
   United Kingdom output in the North Sea, a friendly source and
one relied upon by trading partners, has also been down because of
labor and maintenance problems. It could worsen into fall.
   Mexican production also is off, but stepped-up Mexican,
Venezuelan and American production couldn't for long, if at all,
make up the shortfall from a cessation, however brief, of oil
shipments from the Mideast.
   Incredibly, evidence of Western World vulnerability has been
available _ measured almost to the gallon _ to almost everyone in a
position to take action, including the White House and Congress.
   Every White House economic adviser knew that any official
projections made included assumptions of a plentiful supply of oil
at a moderate price, and that if that assurance was lost then no
forecast made any sense at all.
   That also includes those who made projections of American
industrial production, of stock and bond market performance, of
inflation, interest rates and recession, of homebuilding,
automobile production, airline travel ...
   America's dependency on oil, especially foreign oil, is rising
in spite of at least two serious scares in the 1970s, after which
many leaders declared we could never let it happen again.
   It has grown as reliance on other sources _ hydraulic, solar and
nuclear _ diminished. It has grown as a result of abandonment of
efforts at conservation, which had worked so well. It has grown as
domestic production declined.
   Oil's impact is fundamental and pervasive, even bringing into
question the political and military usage of the word ``powerful,''
as in ``the most powerful nation on earth.''

   Houston real estate dealers and the Soviet Union
are potential gainers, but nearly everyone else stands to lose
economically if the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait leads to a spell of
high oil prices, analysts say.
   ``The oil price increases are both recessionary and inflationary
and there are many more losers than winners,'' said Allen Sinai, an
economist with Boston Co. and Economic Advisers Inc. in an
interview Monday.
   ``If the price increase sticks, it will lead to a major transfer
of wealth from non-oil producing countries to oil countries,'' he
said.
   He and other economists and industry analysts listed a long
string of losers if the current Middle East crisis leads to
sustained oil price increases: the auto industry, housing, nearly
all consumer-related industries, and entertainment and travel firms.
   But higher prices might benefit others, analysts say: investors
in gold and other precious metals, domestic oil companies and oil
drilling companies, as well as the economies of oil-rich states
like Texas and Louisiana.
   Added Sinai: ``The Soviet Union, with its oil and gold reserves,
is a potential winner.''
   Each stressed that any such economic impacts depended on whether
the oil price increase proves to be a momentary blip or a long-term
fact of life.
   John Chadderdon, editor of Offshore Data Services, a
Houston-based publisher of information on offshore drilling for oil
and gas, said that if oil prices rise well above $20 a barrel and
stay there, that might spur exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The price of West Texas crude oil has risen to about $25 a
barrel, up about $4 in the last week, Chadderdon said.
   ``If it's long term, that's something that should spur U.S.
activity. A $20 per barrel price is just not enough for many
companies to go after areas in the Gulf of Mexico. It's just too
expensive,'' he said.
   He speculated that what's good for domestic oil companies might
be good, in the long run, for local real estate in oil producing
regions of the country.
   George McCauley, an oil analyst for the National Utility
Service, Inc., a private consulting firm, said motorists already
feeling the effects at the gas pump will continue to be losers,
along with air travellers.
   Two airlines, Pan American World Airways and Northwest, have
announced ticket price increases to offset rising jet fuel costs.
   And the oil price increases may mean a long, cold, and expensive
winter for homeowners, he said.
   ``If the rise in oil futures prices translates into actual
dollar increases, then come fall when utility companies draw down
current inventories, they will have to be replaced at higher cost
which will be passed on to the consumer,'' McCauley said.
   Sinai added that oil prices would be bad news for nearly all
investors. Only holders of commodities and precious metals might
stand to gain.
   ``Normally, the dollar does well; that is not happening this
time,'' Sinai said.

   Two stock brokers who cooperated with
prosecutors in securities cases stemming from the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandals settled administrative charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   James T. Melton, who testified for the government at the GAF
Corp. stock manipulation trial and Michael Z. Landy, a government
witness against takeover strategist Paul Bilzerian, settled SEC
actions Monday.
   Both men, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to a
six-month ban from dealing in the securities industry.
   Attorneys for neither man were in their office Monday when
called for comment.
   Melton, 47, a former director of trading for Los Angeles-based
Jefferies &amp; Co. testified at two of the three trials of GAF and GAF
Vice Chairman James Sherwin. They were accused of plotting to drive
up the price of Union Carbide stock after a failed GAF takeover
attempt of the chemical-maker. The case ended in a mistrial twice
before a guilty verdict in December 1989.
   Boyd Jefferies, who founded the securities firm and who himself
pleaded guilty to securities law violations, was the government's
key witness against GAF, which was fined $2 million and Sherwin,
who was sentenced to six months in prison.
   Jefferies was given up to authorities by convicted stock
speculator Ivan Boesky, who implicated several Wall Street
professionals in the industry's biggest scandal.
   Melton left Jefferies &amp; Co. in 1989.
   Landy, also 47, a senior vice president at Jefferies, cooperated
with investigators and testified at Bilzerian's trial.
   Bilzerian was convicted of submitting false documents to the
SEC, filing false tax returns and rigging transactions to skirt
federal tax and disclosure laws in tandem with Jefferies. The case
was the first criminal trial of illegal stock ``parking,'' in which
securities ownership is disguised to dodge federal tax or
disclosure laws.
   Bilzerian was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1.5
million.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Freeze on Payments by Asbestos Trust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People awaiting compensation from the Manville
trust fund for asbestos victims will have to wait at least another
month.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn on Monday
extended for 30 days a freeze on payments for asbestos-related
diseases to allow completion of a plan to restructure the
financially ailing trust.
   Weinstein said the extension would allow completion of a
court-appointed reorganization plan for the trust, which has run
out of money to pay new claims by thousands of workers made sick
from inhaling asbestos fibers.
   But Leon Silverman, the bankruptcy court-appointed adviser
supervising the reorganization, said ``it is almost impossible to
conclude'' that the more than 130,000 pending claimants would
receive the full value of their claims.
   The reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the
compensation scheme to process claims based on victims' health and
financial need rather than when they file a claim.
   Weinstein last month set Monday as a deadline for the overhaul
plan and froze spending during the process to prevent a further
cash drain.
   The trust was created in 1988 as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy court reorganization, a result of rising liability from
lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases caused by asbestos.
   The trust has paid $974 million to settle more than 22,000
cases, but still has 130,000 claims pending. A cash shortfall led
the trust recently to say it would not be able to pay new claims
until well into the 21st century.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros in Cleveland on Monday
proposed consolidating pending Manville trust claims with a private
consortium that has been negotiating settlements for other
asbestos-makers.
   Under the proposal, the Center for Claims Resolution in
Princeton, N.J., would be annexed to the legal system and directed
by a board of judges with input from plaintiffs and defense lawyers
and other parties involved.
   The center, which is funded by 20 asbestos defendants and
insurance companies, has settled 36,000 claims in 18 months.
Lambros said a court-affiliated center could minimize transaction
costs and resolve pending claims until a long-term national
settlement scheme is reached.
   Silverman said progress had been made toward providing
``meaningful funds in the near term to victims without sacrificing
the long-term value of the Manville stock.''
   The trust effectively owns 80 percent of Denver-based Manville,
which must make annual payments to the trust beginning next year
and is shielded from further legal liability for asbestos claims.
   Weinstein and Silverman supported continuing an injunction
barring lawsuits against Manville, which would hurt the trust by
depleting the value of Manville assets.
   But the judge criticized Manville, saying the company was
unrealistic about its role in refinancing the trust. Weinstein in
the past has suggested that the company should make new direct
payments of more than $200 million to the trust.
   Manville has said its financial commitment ended with large
contributions when the trust was created and its role is to
strengthen Manville to bolster the trust's value.
   Manville Chief Executive Thomas Stephens said he was
disappointed with Weinstein's comments. He said the company had
offered to inject $500 million last November through a stock
repurchase plan.
   In an interview, Stephens said the company last week recommended
a plan to inject some cash into the trust, which in return would
sell some Manville stock into the marketplace.
   ``We're fully aware and sympathetic of the needs of the
claimants and are doing everything we can to optimize today's
dollar and tomorrow's dollar,'' he said.
   The trust, based in Washington, is named in more than 100,000
lawsuits on the dockets of every federal district court and more
than 500 state courts nationwide.
   The cash shortage at the trust had been anticipated, but made
worse by more cases, larger payouts and quicker settlements than
expected. Victims had received an average of $43,000 per claim,
compared with estimates of $25,000.
   According to court documents, the trust has $93.2 million to pay
$112.8 million in claims already settled. That money is frozen by
the judge's order.
   Asbestos, a white mineral used for heat resistance and
insulation, was widely used in shipbuilding, construction and other
industries.
   Six federal judges are scheduled to meet later this week in
Washington to discuss prospects for consolidating the asbestos
litigation docket into a class action to speed resolution.

<HEAD>Kaifu To Ask Arabs To Boost Oil Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will ask Arab leaders
to help offset the burden of an oil embargo against Iraq by
boosting their oil production, a top government official said
Tuesday.
   Trade Minister Kabun Muto told reporters Kaifu had decided to
make the request to pre-empt problems that could be caused if an
international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil exports is prolonged.
   Kaifu plans to make the request of Arab leaders during a tour of
the Middle East that is to begin Aug. 15 and take him to Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, Muto said. Kaifu's journey
had been arranged before the Iraq-Kuwait crisis erupted.
   Oil-poor Japan on Sunday joined the United States and the
European Community in the embargo to try to force Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces that invaded Kuwait last
Thursday.
   Japan also suspended trade credits to Iraq and Kuwait, banned
trade with both countries, and instructed banks and securities
companies to freeze assets.
   In announcing the sanctions, which were officially approved
Tuesday by the Cabinet, Kaifu stressed that Japan has 142 days of
reserves and ``will come up with necesssary measures to cope with
the problem.''
   Tokyo's actions are seen as especially tough since Japan had
previously taken a low profile in the Middle East, which supplies
much of Japan's oil needs.
   Iraq and Kuwait accounted for 11.2 percent of Japan's oil
supply, or 470,000 barrels a day, in the first quarter of the year,
according to the trade ministry.
   Kaifu and other leaders are calling on the Japanese to conserve
energy, but no measures have been implemented. Officials are
reportedly considering whether the use of air conditioning should
be limited at government offices and gas stations shut down on
weekends.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tried to reassure traders by
saying he does not expect stocks and bonds to suffer an extended
weakness because of the crisis.
   But share prices on Tokyo's rich, and often volatile, stock
market began to tumble almost immediately after the sanctions were
announced.
   The market's main barometer lost 3.1 percent Monday and tumbled
another 3.3 percent Tuesday, bringing the Nikkei Stock Average
index to its lowest level in nearly two years.
   ``Market players were concerned about how much the incident may
prompt inflation,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co. ``Unless they figure out the extent of its effect,
investors are inclined to stay away from the stock market.''
   ``Prices of crude are beginning to increase, so that might have
an effect on inflation,'' conceded Shousuke Tanaka, head of the
Economic Planning Agency's Research Bureau. Tanaka said that with
each 10 percent increase in crude prices, consumer prices go up 0.1
percent.
   Tanaka, however, stressed that his agency does not foresee any
major change in Japan's economic growth that has continued for 44
consecutive months. ``So what we really have to be cautious about
(at this time) is inflationary psychology,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp., faced with sagging
business prospects in the defense industry, has announced plans to
eliminate between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs in California.
   The St. Louis-based defense contractor said Monday it would
combine its Pomona and Valley Systems divisions into a single unit
to be called the Air Defense Systems Division. The two divisions,
located in Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., produce missiles.
   ``The consolidation, effective immediately, is the result of
declining business prospects in the defense industry,'' said Ralph
Hawes, executive vice president for missiles and electronics.
   The announcement was another blow to the defense industry, which
last month was hit with the news that the nation's largest defense
contractor, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., was reducing
its workforce by up to 11 percent, or 17,000 jobs nationwide, by
the end of this year.
   ``In order to remain competitive in a declining market for
missiles and other air defense systems, General Dynamics must more
efficiently use its existing resources and reduce overhead,'' said
Michael C. Keel, who has been named corporate vice president and
general manager of the new division.
   Keel had been corporate vice president and general manager of
the Valley Systems division since 1988. Sterling Starr, who had
been corporate vice president and general manager of the Valley
Systems division, will help in the initial steps of the
consolidation before being reassigned.
   ``While we all welcomed a diminished threat from the Soviet
Union and the end of the Cold War, these changes have brought
unfortunate personal economic consequences for many people in the
U.S. defense industry,'' Keel said.
   Keel added that the company would provide the laid-off employees
with career consulting and placement assistance services. More than
600 of the layoffs will be caused by the elimination of duplicate
jobs, he said.
   The Pomona division produces Standard and Sparrow Missiles and
Phalanx Close-in Weapon Systems, while Valley Systems builds
Stinger and Rolling Airframe Missiles for the U.S. military and its
allies.
   The Pomona division was formed in 1952 and Valley Systems was
created in 1985 in response to the then expanding military market.
The company said the Air Defense Systems Division would not only
operate facilities in Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga, but also in New
Mexico, Arizona, Arkansas and San Diego County in California.
   With the consolidation, General Dynamics, the nation's second
largest defense contractor, has eight divisions and six
subsidiaries. They are all involved in defense work expect Cessna
Aircraft, which makes general aviation aircraft.
   Overall, the company reportedly employs about 103,000 people.

   The stock market opened broadly higher this

slide in stock prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 18.06 at 2,734.40
by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange by 13 to 4, with 848 up, 260 down and 398 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 37.60 million
shares after a half hour of trading.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.27 to 184.59.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged up
0.29 to 340.56.
   Developments in the Middle East continued to dominate the market.
   Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at Blunt

   Declining issues swamped advances in nationwide trading of
NYSE-listed issues, with 1,530 down, 255 up and 255 unchanged.
   Trading activity slowed slightly from Friday's brisk pace. But
volume on the floor of the Big Board still came to a heavy 240.40
million shares, the third highest of the year and compared to

<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. may take control
of its joint venture plant with General Motors Corp. in California
when the option arises in 1996, an executive says.
   If Toyota acquires the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
factory in Fremont, Calif., it will double its own U.S.
manufacturing base now centered at a car plant in Georgetown, Ky.
   ``Our estimation is that we might become a Toyota factory here
in America,'' Gary Convis, NUMMI's vice president for
manufacturing, said Monday.
   Convis, speaking at the opening of a weeklong management
seminar, also said that the company's relationship with the United
Auto Workers union has worked well.
   The UAW has had trouble organizing the so-called transplants _
factories owned wholly or partly by Japanese companies. Three of
the eight non-Big Three factories in the United States have
UAW-negotiated contracts.
   GM and Toyota began producing cars at NUMMI in 1984 and limited
the duration of the joint venture to 12 years because of U.S.
government antitrust requirements.
   So far, neither GM nor Toyota has announced which company would
own the plant after the agreement ends.
   The factory produces the Geo Prizm for GM and the Toyota
Corolla. Last year, Toyota announced a $300 million expansion at
NUMMI to add pickup truck production.

   Stotler Group Inc., until recently a formidable
presence in the futures industry, says it will fight a federal
court lawsuit accusing it of financial misrepresentations.
   A shareholder of the company sued in U.S. District Court,
contending false and misleading information was given to the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding both Stotler Group and
its principal subsidiary, Stotler and Co.
   Stotler Group was headed by Karsten Mahlmann until last
Wednesday, when he resigned from the company and from the
chairmanship of the Chicago Board of Trade. The company was the
subject of an involuntary bankruptcy filing last week by three
creditors who said they were stuck with more than $1 million in
unredeemed loans and investments.
   The brokerage said Monday the latest lawsuit was filed in
Chicago by Robert Elson, a Connecticut investor who reported buying
2,000 shares of Stotler common stock in 1988.
   The complaint, which asks for unspecified damages and for
class-action status, names Stotler Group and certain officers and
directors; Stotler and Co.; and the company's accountant, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.
   The day before Mahlmann's resignation, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission filed a civil complaint accusing a Stotler
subsidiary, Stotler Funds Inc., of improperly using pools of
clients' money that had been set up for investing in commodity
futures contracts.

<HEAD>Index Futures Trip Upside Circuit Breaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volatile price movements this morning in the
stock-index futures market tripped a ``circuit breaker'' for the
fourth straight day _ only this time the market was moving higher
instead of lower.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock-index futures contract for September delivery soared five
points to 339.40 within the first 10 minutes of trading, triggering
an automatic two-minute trading halt.
   The market rose another 1.6 points when trading resumed, then
retreated. The September contract was trading at 339.15 at around
10:30 a.m. EDT. The contract is valued at $500 per point.
   The early gain in the index futures market coincided with a
similarly strong opening in the stock market following reports that
Iraq may allow citizens of the United States and other Western
nations to leave the country.
   The reports prompted an easing of concerns about Iraqi
aggression in the Middle East. Iraq's invasion last week of its
neighbor Kuwait has caused stock markets and index-futures markets
to plunge, and oil prices to soar.
   Stock-index futures are contracts for future deliveries of
baskets of stocks. Investors buy and sell the contracts to hedge
against losses on the stock market or to speculate on market
movements.
   Futures exchanges installed circuit breakers on index futures
after the 1987 stock market crash as a way of building trading
pauses and price limits into the markets to prevent runaway market
moves.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said Tuesday its first-quarter
profit climbed 79 percent despite a much slower rise in sales and
the adverse impact of a strong pound on its international earnings.
   The results were boosted by interest income and asset disposals,
the airline said.
   British Airways said its profit for the three months ended June
30 came to 111 million pounds, or $194 million, from 62 million
pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   Pre-tax profit jumped 62.5 percent to 156 million pounds, or
$273 million, from 96 million pounds a year earlier.
   Sales rose 14 percent to 1.33 billion pounds, or $2.3 billion,
from 1.17 billion pounds a year earlier.
   Earnings included 50 million pounds, or $88 million, from
interest and asset disposals, including airplane sales, compared to
a net loss on such items of 1 million pounds a year ago.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said: ``The increased value
of sterling is putting some pressure on yields but nevertheless the
revenue prospects remain good.''
   He added that the sudden rise in oil prices related to
turbulence in the Middle East is a ``matter of concern.''
   Fuel costs are expected to soar in the near-term in response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.
   In the latest quarter, fuel costs edged 7.4 percent higher to
131 million pounds, or $229 million.
   The airline said its traffic remains buoyant. Passenger loads on
scheduled flights increased to 72.2 percent from 70.4 percent over
the same period, British Airways said.
   Offsetting the improved operating performance, however, were
foreign exchange movements which cost the company an estimated 30
million pounds, or $53 million, in the first quarter and leasing
costs which increased 80 percent to 63 million pounds, or $110
million.
   The 1990 figures were converted at a rate of $1.75 to the pound.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly
reflecting perceptions that tensions in the Middle East are easing.
   Reports that Iraq may allow foreign nationals to leave the
country led to a drop in oil prices this morning, which reduced
inflation fears and prompted selling of grain and soybean futures.
   The crop markets had risen sharply in recent days on
expectations that inflationary pressures would drive food prices
up. But that ``seems to be abating this morning,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He said selling pressure was offset by buying interest linked to
Monday's weekly Agriculture Department crop-progress report.
   The report showed corn and soybean development still lagging far
behind the normal pace.
   The report also showed slight deterioration of the soybean
crop's condition.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.83 a bushel; corn
was } cent lower to { cent higher with September at $2.53{ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with September at
$1.17{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with August at $5.95 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were sharply higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mixed.
   Live cattle futures were .40 cent to .80 cent higher with August
at 77.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to 1.03 cents
higher with August at 89.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent
lower to .63 cent higher with August at 58.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent to 1.5 cents higher with August at 52.05
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday; pork futures rose.

<TEXT>
   Advertising and marketing giant WPP Group PLC on
Tuesday posted a 27 percent increase in its profit for the first
half, boosted by strong contributions from its J. Walter Thompson
and Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide ad agencies.
   WPP said its profit rose to 17.4 million pounds, or $29 million,
in the first six months of the year compared with 13.8 million
pounds in the same period a year ago.
   Pre-tax profit soared 77 percent to 46 million pounds, or $77
million, from 26 million pounds a year earlier.
   Revenue nearly doubled to 2.57 billion pounds, or $4.3 billion,
from 1.29 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The company said its concentration on packaged goods advertising
would help it outperform the U.S. and British advertising
industries generally, which have suffered slowdowns.
   The company said advertising revenues from companies launching
new products or defending market share would benefit WPP, despite
industry fears that the drop in consumer demand would affect
advertising spending.
   WPP said its J. Walter Thompson advertising division is
operating ahead of budget, helped by $195 million of net new
business during the first half.
   Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide is also working ahead of budget,
winning net new billings of $270 million. WPP acquired Ogilvy &amp;
Mather for $862 million last June.
   The company's public relations firm Hill and Knowlton added net
new business of $14 million in the first half, WPP said.
   The 1990 figures were converted at a rate of $1.67 to the pound,
a figure provided by the company.

   Lawmakers today called for presidential
jawboning and tapping of emergency oil reserves to combat rising
gasoline prices that have followed the invasion of Kuwait.
   ``In the last week, American consumers have been ripped off on a
massive scale,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., complained at a
hearing before the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose troops took over oil-rich
Kuwait on Thursday, ``may not be the only greedy person in this
picture,'' said Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind., as he opened a hearing of
the House Energy subcommittee on energy and power.
   The chief targets of the hearings were U.S. oil companies, which
have raised gasoline prices by as much as 19 cents a gallon since
the invasion. The Justice Department served notice Monday that it
will seek out and prosecute any anti-competitive practices.
   Charles J. Dibona, president of the industry's American
Petroleum Institute, said critics of the price increases were
taking ``a naive, one-sided view of how markets work.''
   In written testimony for the Senate subcommittee, Dibona said
oil companies had no choice but to pass on to consumers immediately
the higher cost of oil _ even though gasoline from that oil will
not reach pumps for months.
   Lieberman and witnesses at his hearing said President Bush
should summon executives of the big oil companies and tell them to
stop gouging the public. Lieberman cited President Kennedy's
example in dealing with a steel price increase.
   ``It's called leadership,'' said Rhode Island Attorney General
James E. O'Neil. He sid there is little that state and local
officials could do to bring down gasoline prices.
   Sharp said the loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait calls for
dipping into the 509-million-barrel U.S. Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. ``The time to use it is now,'' he said.
   But John Easton of the Energy Department said the law allows use
of those reserves only to make up for supply shortages, not to
bring down prices. He said U.S. commercial supplies of 392 million
barrels are at the highest level in nine years.
   ``There is not a significant shortfall and there are unused
production capacities in many countries,'' Easton said.
   On Monday, Jim Connolly, who heads a group of gasoline dealers
in the Northeast, said statons are caught in the middle, with oil
companies following a ``greed is good'' motto.
   Oil companies said the increases were necessary because the
price of crude oil already has gone up, and the invasion of Kuwait
only added further justification.
   As gas prices went up as much as 19 cents a gallon at service
stations across the country, the pressure for other increases began
to spread through transportation industries.
   Pan American and Northwest airlines announced higher ticket
prices, and the American Trucking Associations appealed to the
government to let haulers respond more quickly with freight
increases each time the price of diesel fuel goes up.
   Higher freight rates could lead to increased costs for virtually
everything shipped to a retail store or America's front doors.
   The oil companies are ``profiteering at a time of international
tension,'' said Edwin Rothschild of the consumer group Citizen
Action, and he called for a boycott of the highest-priced gas
stations in each community.
   State officials in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North
Carolina and Pennsylvania announced investigations of possible
local price-gouging by oil companies.
   The companies say their prices are the result of increases in
crude oil costs from $16 a barrel in July to $27 after the Kuwaiti
invasion.
   ``Refiners are not yet recovering in the marketplace a
significant portion of crude oil cost increases that they've
already incurred,'' said Anita Larsen, a Texaco Co. spokeswoman.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission said the average price of
diesel fuel, based on a check of 16 stations nationwide, rose 8.6
cents to $1.186 per gallon Monday from July 31.
   An interstate trucker in Virginia reported paying 19 cents more
per gallon this week than on July 27.
   The American Automobile Association said the average cost of
self-service unleaded gasoline increased 11.1 cents from last
Thursday to $1.186 per gallon, including a 7.1-cent jump over the
weekend.
   Energy and Transportation department officials issued a joint
statement with the Justice Department expressing concern about the
price increases ``and the hardships they may be causing.''
   Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore urged consumer
conservation and said, ``We believe that the oil industry should
not be carried away by speculation about future events.''

   The stock market was mixed in choppy trading
today, but a blue chip retreat that began in late morning had lost
momentum by midday.
   Blue chip stocks, which posted gains for most of the morning,
abruptly reversed course and tumbled. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks fell more than 50 points before bobbing back up.
   At noon on Wall Street, the blue chip indicator was down 1.98 at
2,714.36. In the three sessions since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the
measure has fallen 188.86 points, or 6.5 percent.
   The broader market never completely yielded its lead as buyers
still found plenty of bargains after the steep slide in stock
prices over the past three sessions.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange by a dwindling margin of about 7 to 5, with 832 up, 583
down and 450 unchanged.
   Trading activity remained close to the brisk pace of recent
days. Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127.74 million
shares at midday compared to 131.07 million shares at the same
point on Monday.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks held a
gain of 0.08 at 183.40.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index turned
down 1.09 to 339.18.
   Developments in the Middle East continued to dominate the market.
   Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at Blunt
Ellis &amp; Loewi, said there is a perception that actions taken by the
United States and other countries to thwart Iraq are working and
will help steady the turbulent oil market.
   The explosion in oil prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last

   Syntro Corp. has agreed to pay royalties
to Upjohn Co. for sales of a genetically engineered vaccine for
swine, settling a patent dispute between the companies, Upjohn said
Tuesday.
   Both Upjohn and Syntro will continue marketing their
pseudorabies vaccines, Syntro, under license from Upjohn, the
companies said. The amount of royalties wasn't divulged.
   Upjohn claimed in a March 1989 lawsuit the PRV-Marker
pseudorabies vaccine marketed by Syntro's SyntroVet Inc. animal
health subsidiary infringed on Upjohn's patent for its TOLVID
pseudorabies vaccine.
   The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company, with 1989 sales of
$2.91 billion, also filed suit against SyntroVet in Kansas. Syntro,
a biotechnology company based in San Diego and Lenexa, Kan., with
1989 revenues of $2.1 million, filed counterclaims.
   ``We are pleased that this settlement provides further
recognition of our scientific efforts,'' said Gerald A. Welch,
senior vice president of Upjohn and general manager of its
Agricultural Division.
   ``Syntro will now focus our resources on additional applications
of our technology,'' Syntro President J. Donald Todd said.
   Pseudorabies is caused by a herpes virus. It causes respiratory
problems, crippling and reduced size in pigs, and death in baby
pigs. It doesn't affect humans.

<HEAD>Textile Workers Union Files Suit Against Health-tex Over Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge set a hearing next week
on a lawsuit filed by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union to keep Health-tex from closing six plants and laying off
workers.
   The union and 12 workers filed the suit against the children's
wear manufacturer Monday in U.S. District Court in Birmingham on
behalf of 4,000 Health-tex workers nationwide.
   They also sought a temporary restraining order to keep the
financially troubled company from closing six U.S. plants and
distribution centers, laying off workers or liquidating assets.
U.S. District Judge William Acker declined to issue the order, but
set a hearing for Aug. 13, said John W. Hargrove, one of the
company's Birmingham lawyers.
   The union's claims are ``without merit, and we're going to
respond to that lawsuit appropriately,'' Hargrove said.
   Friday was the last day of work for most employees at
Health-tex's plant in Gadsden, Ala., which once employed 600. The
suit also affects employees at manufacturing or distribution
facilities in Cumberland, R.I., Danville, Va., LaFollette, Tenn.,
Warrenton, Ga. and Centreville, Ala.
   Union general counsel Ronald Rosenberg said in a statement
Monday that Health-tex's ``unilateral move to close its plants and
liquidate its assets is clearly illegal under its collective
barganing agreement with its employees.'' ``Already, these
employees and their communities have suffered tremendous losses,''
he said.
   Rosenberg said the union's collective bargaining agreement
requires Health-tex to ``meet, discuss and negotiate'' with union
officials about plant closings. The suit was filed after company
officials did not respond to union requests for arbitration, he
said.
   Hargrove said Rosenberg's interpretation of the collective
bargaining agreement was inaccurate. ``That was taken out of
context,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Firm, Gold Rises</HEAD>

prices.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar held fairly steady today against major
European currencies following big losses the previous day.
   Gold prices rose on uncertainty in the Mideast, although the
advance was more subdued than in sessions immediately after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Dealers said the dollar steadied as reports that foreigners were
being transferred from Kuwait to Baghdad were taken as a sign that
tensions in the region could be easing.
   A moderate recovery in the European and U.S. equity and bond
markets also helped the dollar.
   Nonetheless, traders in London said the dollar still appears
fundamentally weak. Recent government reports have indicated
weakness in the U.S. economy which some analysts say will prompt
the Federal Reserve to encourage lower interest rates. Falling
rates would make the dollar-denominated investments less attractive
to foreign investors, and curb demand for the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 150.60 Japanese yen from
149.50 yen at Monday's close. Later in London, it fell to 149.90
yen. The dollar was quoted at 150.015 yen at midday in New York.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8765 from $1.8725 late
Tuesday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8780.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.5763 West German marks, up from 1.5762; 1.3315
Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.2295 French francs, down from 5.2863;
1.7785 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7766; 1,155.37 Italian lire, up
from 1,154.00, and 1.1495 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1490.
   Selected midday dollar prices in New York included: 1.5815 West
German marks, 1.32955 Swiss francs, 1,156.75 Italian lire and
1.15025 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to $383.25 a troy ounce from $382.50 late
Monday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $383.15 from $382.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.94 to $383.52 an ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $4.89 a troy ounce, down from
$4.91 late Monday.

<HEAD>Mexico Unable To Increase Crude Oil Exports During Iraqi Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iraq-Markets Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

   Mexico does not plan to increase its crude
oil exports, even though oil prices have shot up since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, government officials say.
   ``We're watching prices very closely, but _ absolutely not _ we
have not changed our policy,'' a source at the state petroleum
monopoly Pemex said in an interview Monday night.
   Furthermore, experts said Mexico already is producing at full
capacity and would be hard-pressed to boost exports significantly
even if it wanted to.
   The Pemex source denied rumors that Mexico _ the world's fifth
biggest crude oil exporter _ planned to increase sales to Spain to
make up for a shortfall caused by the Iraqi invasion.
   Officials at Pemex and elsewhere in President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's administration, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said
Mexico may gain billions of dollars in revenue from higher world
oil prices but in the long run a sharp rise could be harmful.
   ``What we want _ and it's in our interest _ is market and price
stability. We don't like prices to shoot up all of a sudden and
then suddenly slide sharply,'' said another official at Pemex,
officially known as Petroleos Mexicanos SA.
   The world oil crisis in the 1970s gave Mexico a roaring economy
but had aftereffects of runaway inflation, high unemployment, high
interest rates and a foreign debt now estimated at $90 billion.
   A number of business leaders believe a sustained rise in global
oil prices could lead to higher world inflation, higher interest
rates, falling stock prices, and in the long run a shrinking of
foreign investment and credit on which Mexico heavily depends for
development.
   West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent _ two grades Pemex
uses as guidelines for setting prices on its crude _ both were up
sharply again Tuesday, with WTI trading near five-year highs of
more than $28 a barrel.
   During the past five months, Mexico has been exporting an
average of 1.216 million barrels a day of a mixture of its
extra-light Olmec, sold only to the United States, and its light
Isthmus and heavy Maya.
   Of these, 656,000 barrels a day went to the United States,
65,000 to Central America and the Caribbean, 351,000 to Spain and
144,000 to Japan. Mexico is the United States' sixth-biggest
supplier after Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Canada and Iraq.
   Mexico has produced about 2.61 million barrels a day during the
past five months.
   But experts say Pemex cannot raise production levels
significantly due to lack of investment and oil field development.
Its oil wells are pumping at full capacity and no new fields have
been explored or developed in recent years.
   A June report by the Private Sector for Economic Studies think
tank showed Pemex cut its capital investments by more than half
since oil prices plunged in 1982, throwing Mexico into an economic
crisis from which it is just beginning to recover.
   As a result, the report said, Mexico's proven petroleum reserves
dropped from 72.5 billion barrels in 1983 to 66.45 billion barrels
in 1989.
   Meanwhile, domestic gasoline consumption rose by 23 percent from
1985 to 1989 and Pemex has been importing the fuel in rising
amounts, according to the report. It said gasoline imports rose to
$229.5 million in 1989 from $18.9 million in 1988.

   Share prices finished higher on London's Stock
Exchange Tuesday, for a partial rebound from sharp losses a day ago.
   In the first hour of trading, stocks raced higher on futures-led
buying and optimism that Iraq was about to allow foreign nationals
being held in Baghdad to leave the country.
   But doubts emerged later in the day, undermining share prices.
   Expectations also were dashed that Wall Street would recover a
good portion of its day-earlier losses, dealers said, as the New
York market opened with a 33-point rise but then slowly watched
those gains disappear.
   By the close of the London session, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up just 1.24 points at 2,717.58, on the heels of a
93-point loss Monday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 15.6
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,235.8, well down from the session high
of 2,260.9.
   The session minimum was 2,224.2, at the start of official
trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 16.5 points at 1,748.4
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.64 points
to close at 1,211.06.
   Volume came to 497.5 million shares, compared with 591.3 million

activity today as traders reacted to Middle East developments.
   Blue chip stocks, which posted gains for most of the morning,

<HEAD>Posts Profit Rise in Fourth Quarter, Decline for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. said Tuesday its earnings climbed
17.3 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter but plunged 16.7 percent
for the year.
   Quaker said a decline in demand for oat bran, as well as costs
associated with the reorganization of the company's grocery
products business, contributed to the slump for the year.
   But it said a renewed focus on its food business following the
spin off of its Fisher-Price toy division is helping the company
get back on track.
   For the fourth quarter, which ended June 30, net income totaled
$66.3 million, or 86 cents per share, compared with $56.5 million,
or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 3.7 percent to $1.41 billion from
$1.36 billion a year earlier.
   Net income for fiscal 1990 fell to $169 million, or $2.15 per
share, from $203 million, or $2.56 a share, in 1989.
   Sales for the year rose 3.1 percent to $5.03 billion from $4.88
billion.
   William D. Smithburg, Quaker's chairman and chief executive,
said the fiscal 1990 results were below expectations.
   ``In our U.S. Grocery Products business, intense competition in
cereals and pet foods, along with unfavorably cool weather
conditions for Gatorade early in the fiscal year, and the sudden
decline in demand for oat bran products, all combined to produce
results below expectations even though operating income was up for
the year,'' he said.
   But he said ``operational streamlining over the last year,
combined with our renewed focus as a pure food company, will help
us regain the earnings momentum established during the 1980s.''
   Quaker announced in April the spin off of troubled Fisher-Price.
In reorganizing its U.S. grocery products business and in an effort
to cut costs, the company said in June that up to 400 jobs would be
cut from that unit by the end of the year.

   Three Eli Lilly &amp; Co. plants in Puerto Rico
failed to follow federal regulations on manufacturing practices
last year, according to inspection reports released by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
   No products were recalled, and the Indianapolis-based
pharmaceutical company agreed in January to a schedule for making
corrections.
   ``We believe the steps we have taken have resolved those issues,
and we continue to work with FDA inspectors to ensure our practices
comply with all existing regulations,'' said Lilly spokesman Edward
A. West.
   The FDA reports were obtained Monday by The Indianapolis Star
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   In one document, Edward R. Esparza, director of the FDA's
district office in Puerto Rico, said the company failed to maintain
manufacturing practices required by federal regulations.
   FDA inspectors criticized an uncovered section of a conveyor
line in which bottles were being filled with Ilosone liquid, an
antibiotic. Gaps in an overhead conveyor chute ``permitted pieces
of broken caps to fall onto and around the bottle conveyor,'' the
report said.
   The document referred to inspections conducted June 1989 through
October 1989 at three Lilly plants in Carolina, Puerto Rico.
   In subsequent correspondence, Esparza said Lilly had answered
most of the questions raised by the inspections and had produced a
satisfactory schedule for correcting the problems.
   The inspections of Lilly's Puerto Rican operations occurred
during and after a four-month FDA inspection of Lilly's
Indianapolis facilities, which resulted in the recall of some
batches of more than 10 products.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's economy is in chaos and faces
an extremely difficult six months ahead, says the West German
overseeing the nation's businesses.
   Reiner Gohlke's remarks, published Tuesday in an East German
newspaper, are some of the most ominous to date about the country's
rapidly deteriorating economic situation.
   They coincided with the release of the latest official
unemployment figures showing the number of East German jobless
jumped to 272,017 last month, up from 142,096 in June.
   More than 656,000 of the nation's 8.8 million workers were
working short shifts because of the lack of demand for East German
products.
   Since the West German mark became the East German currency on
July 1, the country's 8,000 major businesses have faced increasing
difficulties staying afloat.
   ``The next six months will be the hardest,'' the newspaper Neue
Zeit quoted Gohlke as saying. ``We will have to go through a very
deep swamp.''
   There have been predictions that up to 4 million East Germans
could be out of work by early next year as businesses close.
   That, in turn, has led to predictions of worker unrest in the
former Communist nation.
   ``The situation is worse than I had thought,'' Gohlke said. ``We
have chaos. Nothing is running normally.''
   The Neue Zeit newspaper is closely linked to the Christian
Democrats of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Gohlke, former chief of West Germany's huge railroad system,
recently became the chief of the board overseeing East German
economic reform attempts.
   That makes him one of the most influential people in East
Germany today. The country is making a headlong rush from a
state-run economy to a capitalist system.
   Despite the troubles, Gohlke's opinion was not all negative.
   East Germany's resources and people are the key to rebuilding
the country, he said.
   East Germany will be united with economic powerhouse West
Germany by the end of the year. Economists expect an economy
recovery in East Germany late in 1991, after unproductive,
state-run businesses reform or close for good.
   In addition, West German companies are rushing in to set up
production and will be using East German workers. Also, thousands
of East Germans are setting up small business, many in the
long-neglected service industry.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as tensions in the
Middle East appeared to ease, reducing inflationary pressures.
   Reports that Iraq may allow foreign nationals to leave the
country led to a drop in oil prices Tuesday morning, which reduced
inflation fears and prompted selling of grain and soybean futures.
   In the absence of dramatic developments in the Iraq-Kuwait
conflict, traders in Chicago concentrated on evening up their
market positions ahead of Thursday's Agriculture Department crop
report, said Gerald Zusel, director of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
floor operations at the exchange.
   The report, scheduled for release after Thursday's close, will
contain the government's first official estimates of 1990 U.S. corn
and soybean production.
   A survey indicated grain analysts expect a corn harvest of 7.9
billion bushels compared with 7.5 billion last year. Analysts
projected soybean production at 1.86 billion bushels, slightly
below last year's 1.93 billion.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were \ cent lower to 2 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $2.82 a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to 2} cents higher with September at
$2.53 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with

<HEAD>June Consumers' Borrowing Falls from Level in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $463 million more in
consumer credit than they paid off in June, the government said
Tuesday, but the borrowing pace fell well below that of May.
   Many analysts have been concerned recently over the caution
displayed by consumers, who have fueled an economic expansion that
would reach its eighth anniversary in November. Consumers represent
about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   The Commerce Department said consumer credit edged up just 0.8
percent at an annual rate following a 6.1 percent gain, or $3.65
billion, in May.
   The slowing resulted in part from a 6.6 percent decline in
automobile loans, down from a level of $1.58 billion in May. The
May rate of growth had been unchanged after an 8.2 percent decline
in the previous month. The figures are adjusted for seasonal
variations.
   At the same time, revolving or credit card debt gained $1.3
billion, a 7.6 percent advance at an annual rate. The advance came
on top of a 18.8 percent increase in April.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $827
million, a 4.8 percent annual rate after gains of 2.1 percent in
May and 4.0 percent in April.
   But borrowing for mobile homes fell 4.5 percent, a $85 million
decline, nearly giving up its 6.0 percent advance in May. Mobile
home debt had declined 0.3 percent in April.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of June
at $724.9 billion.

<TEXT>
   Conflicting rumors from the tense Middle East buffeted oil
prices today and jolted other financial markets, but the panicky
trading atmosphere caused by Iraq's seizure of Kuwait last week
seemed to subside.
   Oil traders said speculative reports about the possibility of a
Middle East war mainly influenced the energy markets, where crude
prices seesawed this afternoon after shooting above $28 a barrel on
Monday, the highest level in five years.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a key barometer of energy
prices, the cost of benchmark West Texas Intermediate was weaker at
midday on indications that the Iraqis might be capitulating to the
effects of a worldwide boycott. But prices later jumped ahead to
about $29 a barrel on reports that Iraq had strengthened troop
readiness along the Saudi Arabian frontier.
   Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo, rallied in London and seesawed in
New York following Monday's big loss. By late afternoon on Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 13 points
to the 2,703 level in choppy trading. Other market indicators also
fluctuated.
   ``It's been bouncing up and down,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager
of over-the-counter stock trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers in
New York. ``Any time people see a little strength, they say, `let
me out.'''
   Elsewhere, U.S. bond prices rebounded from losses Monday then
weakened again over anxiety about possible oil-shock inflation. The
dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen, but was fairly
steady in trading against major European currencies. Gold prices
followed the behavior of oil.
   Still, the volatility that gripped Wall Street and other markets
Monday and last week seemed to ease noticeably, reflecting what
traders called less emotional knee-jerk reactions to events coming
out of the Middle East.
   Today's biggest losers appeared to be Japanese stocks. On the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average dropped
946.46 points, or 3.31 percent, to close at 27,653.07.
   Japan is particularly vulnerable to oil shocks because it
imports 99 percent of its oil. The Japanese market has dropped
nearly 3,200 points since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
   ``A pessimistic view is dominating the market. ... Unless
investors have some idea how this Middle East situation would
actually affect the Japanese economy, their uncertainties and fears
will keep affecting the stock market,'' Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader
with New Japan Securities Co., said referring to the Tokyo exchange.
   While the dollar held steady against most major currencies today
in Europe, it was up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar rose 1.10 yen to close at 150.60 yen in Tokyo. Later
in London, the dollar was quoted at a lower rate of 149.73 yen but
strengthened later in New York to about 149.90 yen.
   The world's financial markets have been rocked by rising oil
prices in recent days because of the potential impact higher fuel
costs could have throughout the world economy.
   ``As oil prices are actually rising, investors' fears of
inflation are intensifying,'' said Kideyuki Matsuda, a trader with
Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co. ``Basically, there is no
positive factor in the market now.''
   Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on
Monday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude jumped $3.56 to settle at $28.05 a 42-gallon barrel _ its
highest price since August 1985.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Monday,
wholesale unleaded gasoline jumped 9.34 cents to 81.52 cents a
gallon and wholesale home heating oil was up 8.97 cents to 75.55
cents.
   Concerns about rapidly rising oil prices stemming from the
Persian Gulf crisis pushed stocks, bonds and the dollar sharply
lower Monday. In foreign exchange, the dollar closed lower against
all major currencies, except the Japanese yen, in New York.
   U.S. traders said the markets were jolted by continued worries
that sharply higher oil prices, stemming from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait last week, could trigger higher inflation and push the
nation into a recession.
   ``The economy is in pretty bad shape now. This could make things
worse,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.

   Stocks mostly moved lower in heavy and choppy
activity today as traders reacted to Middle East developments.
   The panicky selling wave that engulfed Wall Street Monday,
producing the worst performance since the ``mini-crash'' last
October, subsided.
   But buyers failed to flock back to the market as pessmism
prevailed in the face of an ailing economy, a rising inflation
threat and the Middle East crisis.
   Developments unfolding in the Mideast made the stock market
reverse course several times. Traders appeared to pounce on each
piece of news regarding the Iraq-Kuwait conflict.
   Word from the State Department in Washington that Iraq was
increasing its troop readiness on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi
Arabia increased the edginess in financial markets. A rumor, later
denied, that Iraq had invaded Saudi Arabia temporarily incited
heavy selling.
   The White House refused to comment on a report that the United
States was beginning a major troop deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   Oil and related stocks were particularly sensitive to
fluctuations in petroleum futures. On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude settled at $28.31 a
barrel, up 26 cents.
   For the most part, foreign stock markets steadied, which helped
restore calm in the United States.
   The London stock market staged a partial rebound and the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 15.6 points, or
0.7 percent, to 2,235.8.
   But in oil-dependent Japan, stocks continued to suffer. The
225-share Nikkei Stock Average dropped 946.46 points, or 3.31
percent, to close at 27,653.07.
   Blue chip stocks, which posted gains for most of the morning,
abruptly reversed course and tumbled shortly before midday. Later,
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks bobbed up and down
but never managed to move back into the plus column.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Fund Buys Minority Stake in Radio Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merchant banking funds headed by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. have agreed to buy a significant minority interest in
Infinity Broadcasting Corp., which owns 17 radio stations.
   The privately owned company announced Monday that the Merchant
Banking Partnerships of Lehman Brothers agreed to buy $26.7 million
in newly-issued stock and warrants from Infinity Broadcasting.
   In addition, the funds agreed to pay an undisclosed sum for
additional stock from the founders of Infinity Broadcasting,
Michael Weiner and Gerald Carrus.
   After the deal is completed, the partnership will own just under
50 percent of the company's stock, according to Infinity spokesman
Farid Suleman.
   The biggest individual shareholder will be Mel Karmazin,
Infinity's president and chief executive, who holds just under 20
percent.
   Weiner and Carrus, who will stay on as co-chairmen of the
company, each will own under 10 percent of the company, Suleman
said.
   Warrants held by bondholders and employee stock options account
for most of the remainder of the company's stock.
   ``We are strong believers in the continuing and future value of
radio-related assets and are excited to enter into this strategic
partnership with Inifinity, the largest privately held radio
company in the country,'' Jim Stern, Lehman Brothers' managing
director, said in a news release.
   Suleman said Infinity had $107.8 million in revenue last year.
   Infinity owns and operates the following radio stations: WXRK-FM
and WZRC-AM in New York; KROQ-FM, Los Angeles; WJMK-FM and WJJD-AM,
Chicago; WYSP-FM, Philadelphia; KOME-FM, San Jose-San Francisco;
WBCN-FM, Boston; WOMC-FM, Detroit, and KVIL-AM and KVIL-FM, Dallas.

<HEAD>Western Union, Union Employees Still Without Agreement</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: May stand</NOTE>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With an expired contract
looming, representatives of Western Union Corp. and 2,500 union
workers on Tuesday were expected to resume stalled negotiations.
   The negotiator for the union, the Communications Workers of
America, reported progress on a wage agreement but said the company
had not yielded on demands that medical benefits be reduced, job
categories be consolidated and the number of part-time employees be
increased.
   A two-year contract between employees and the giant telegram
company expired Monday, but workers decided to return to the
bargaining table rather than strike, said Dan J. Beckstead,
president of the CWA-United Telegraph Workers Bargaining Council.
   In the event of a walkout, the company has trained more than
1,000 temporary workers to keep operations afloat, the company said.
   Western Union spokesman Warren Bechtel said he thought progress
had been made in the late-night talks that broke up at 2 a.m.
Tuesday, but he declined to discuss details.
   On Monday, Bechtel said the Upper Saddle River-based company
sought a contract that will allow it to operate profitably for the
first time in more than seven years.
   A major obstacle to a settlement was the company's demand that
union workers pay higher medical insurance premiums, Bechtel said.
   Neither he nor Beckstead would provide specific details about
how the costs would be shared, but on Monday Bechtel said union
employees would pay as much as non-union employees do under Western
Union's proposal.
   The union also balked at the company's proposals to combine the
duties of operators and customer relations clerks, and to increase
the number of part-time employees not entitled to benefits under
the union contract.
   Labor-management disputes have led to three major strikes in the
past four decades. Workers walked off the job for 10 days in 1985,
for 57 days in 1971 and 53 days in 1952, Beckstead said.
   The union has not set a settlement deadline, he said.
   Communications Workers of America represents operators, customer
relations clerks, other clerical workers and field technicians who
work for Western Union nationwide, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against all
major currencies except the German mark, as traders kept a close
watch on the Persian Gulf crisis and its effect on interest rates.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $384.50 a troy ounce, down 20 cents from
Monday. Later, Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for
gold at $385.50 an ounce, up $1.50. Ronald H. Holzer, chief
currency dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, attributed the
dollar's rise largely to technical factors. But he said traders
were also buying dollars on the belief that U.S. interest rates
would remain stable for the short term.
   ``Short-term rates have not moved lower,'' Holzer said.
   In fact, interest rates in the public bond markets have risen
sharply in recent days on inflation fears, which stemmed from the
rapid rise in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of neighboring
Kuwait last week.
   When interest rates decline the value of a currency tends to
follow suit.
   The dollar had fallen sharply on Tuesday against all major
currencies except the Japanese yen, on worries that the Federal
Reserve would push interest rates lower to prevent the country from
falling into a recession.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed up
150.60 Japanese yen from 149.50 yen Monday. It traded at 149.90 yen
in London, and at 150.90 yen in New York, up from 150.35 yen Monday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared to
Monday. Sterling bought $1.8765 in London, up from $1.8725, and
$1.8715 in New York, down from $1.8725.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.5875 German marks, down from 1.57875; 1.3370
Swiss francs, up from 1.3310; 5.3230 French francs, up from 5.2890;
1,162.25 Italian lire, up from 1,154.50, and 1.15125 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.14955.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.5763 West
German marks, up from 1.5762; 1.3315 Swiss francs, unchanged;
5.2295 French francs, down from 5.2863; 1.7785 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.7766; 1,155.37 Italian lire, up from 1,154.00, and 1.1495
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1490.
   Gold rose in London to $383.25 an ounce from $382.50 late
Monday. In Zurich, it rose to $383.15 an ounce from $382.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.94 to $383.52 an ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.857 a troy ounce, down from $4.892
Monday. Silver fell in London to $4.89 an ounce from $4.91.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats charged Tuesday that
oil companies are engaging in price-gouging and exhorted President
Bush to stop it.
   ``Someone is making a killing,'' Sen. John Kerry exclaimed, at
one of three hastily arranged public hearings on sharp increases in
American fuel prices following Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   Charles J. Di Bona, president of the American Petroleum
Institute, vehemently denied the accusation. Critics of the oil
industry are taking ``a naive, one-sided view of how markets
work,'' he said.
   U.S. oil companies had no choice but to pass on to consumers the
higher cost of oil on the world market, Di Bona maintained, saying
prices would drop if world prices fall.
   But angry members of Congress said Bush should jawbone industry
leaders for price relief _ in much the same way President John F.
Kennedy did with the steel industry.
   Bush also was urged to tap the government's crude oil reserve.
The aim would be to cushion American consumers against further
economic repercussions from Mideast hostilities.
   Oil companies have raised gasoline prices by as much as 25 cents
a gallon since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his forces into
neighboring Kuwait last week. Company executives said their prices
are the result of increases in crude oil costs from $16 a barrel in
July to $27 after the invasion.
   The American Automobile Association reported Tuesday that prices
for self-service unleaded gas went up an average of 1.5 cents per
gallon overnight and have averaged 12.6 cents higher than they were
Aug. 1. The average is now $1.20 per gallon, the highest since
1985, said the AAA, which checked 1,400 service stations nationwide.
   Tuesday's spate of hearings was an unusual occurrence during a
congressional recess. But lawmakers were anxious to vent
constituents' anger over price hikes. They were joined in this
high-profile public interrogation by officials of state and local
governments and consumer groups.
   Despite oil industry denials of price-gouging, several witnesses
maintained the evidence was otherwise. They complained that oil
companies are quick to pass on price increases but slow to pass
along any savings.
   ``The American public is angry. It's mad as hell. They have a
sense they are being held hostage to you, the oil companies,'' said
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
   The industry executives were summoned a day after the Justice
Department pledged it would look into the soaring fuel prices.
Anti-competitive pricing activities will be aggressively
prosecuted, it said.
   But that did not satisfy angry congressmen.
   ``In the last week, American consumers have been ripped off on a
massive scale,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., complained to
witnesses appearing before a Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee.
   Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind., said Saddam ``may not be the only
greedy person in this picture.'' Added Sen. John Danforth of
Missouri: ``There is another villain on the scene.''
   Bryan cited a nationwide survey by the American Automobile
Association showing gas prices up at least 11 cents _ and as high
as 19 cents _ since last week's invasion. The prices have soared
despite evidence showing supplies are still plentiful.
   ``One is left with the inescapable conclusion that profiteering
is occurring at the expense of the American consumer,'' Bryan said.
   But Glenn Tilton, president of Texaco Refining and Marketing
Inc., said his company was a hostage to supply and demand _ and
thus had to raise its prices along with everyone else.
   ``This one company cannot price... out of step with the
realities of the market,'' or its supplies would be stripped, he
said.
   But William McGilacuddy, president of the Virginia Service
Station Dealers and Auto Repair Association, acknowledged, ``There
is no competition at the wholesale level whatsoever.''
   Lieberman said Bush should summon executives of the big oil
companies and tell them to exercise price restraint.
   When the Connecticut Democrat's attempt to put the onus on Bush
was echoed by Rhode Island Attorney General James E. O'Neil,
Danforth, the only Republican at the hearing, questioned what good
it would do. After all, he said, the oil companies could merely
refuse to cooperate.
   ``It's called leadership,'' O'Neil shot back.
   On the House side of Capitol Hill, John Easton, deputy assistant
secretary of energy for international affairs and energy
emergencies, told Sharp's subcommittee the administration was
prepared to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ if there were a
``severe energy supply interruption.''
   He said American consumers may not tolerate high gas prices but
they also will not tolerate use of U.S. reserves to bolster world
supplies without similar sacrifices by other countries.
   Easton said the law allows use of the 590 million barrel
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make up for severe supply
interruptions, not to bring down prices.
   But Sharp said the U.S. government should consider dipping into
the reserves unilaterally to protect the economy and consumers.
   ``There is a higher risk of damage in delay,'' he said.
   Sharp said Congress would not tolerate ``a legalistic
determination about supply interruption'' to justify lack of action.
   Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said at one point during the
Senate subcommittee hearing that the public didn't ``want to hear a
lot of politicians yelling about it.''
   But they all did it anyway at the televised hearings.
   ``I'm perfectly willing to pile on this one,'' Danforth admitted.

<HEAD>Reports Smaller Loss in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said Tuesday
it lost $23 million in the second quarter compared with a loss of
$42.6 million for the same period a year earlier.
   The smaller loss reflected higher revenue from publishing and
insurance operations, cost reductions in publishing and lower
interest expenses due to the paydown of debt with proceeds from
asset sales, the company said.
   The company has a $1.6 billion debt, much of it taken on when it
thwarted a hostile takeover offer in 1987.
   Harcourt also said its annual meeting of shareholders, which was
scheduled for September 1990, will be rescheduled for a later date.
   On a per-share basis, the company said it lost 39 cents for the
three months ended June 30 compared with a loss of 84 cents in the
same quarter in 1989.
   Revenue rose 6.1 percent to $348.5 million in the quarter from
$328.6 million a year earlier.
   The company's publishing operations reported income from
operations of $34.7 million in the quarter, up 39.4 percent from a
year earlier, as revenue rose 2.7 percent to $227 million.
   Income from insurance operations rose 11.6 percent to $10.6
million in the quarter as revenue rose 13 percent to $121.5 million.
   Interest expense fell to $66 million from $91.6 million a year
earlier.
   For the first half, the company reported it lost $94.9 million,
or $1.47 a share, compared with a loss of $158.7 million, or $2.64
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first half rose 9.7 percent to $625.4 million
from $570.2 million a year earlier.
   The company said its first half revenues are not indicative of
the entire year because the publishing business is highly seasonal,
with the majority of revenues and operating profits coming in
during the third quarter.
   Harcourt undertook a $3 billion recapitalization in 1987 after
an unsolicited buyout offer from Britain's Robert Maxwell. As part
of the plan, the company borrowed heavily to pay special dividends
to shareholders.
   Last fall, Harcourt sold its Sea World theme parks for $1.1
billion in an effort to reduce its debt.
   In June, longtime Harcourt chairman William I. Jovanovich
resigned and was replaced by John S. Herrington, a former secretary
of energy during the Reagan administration.
   The job of running the company has fallen to Jovanovich's son,
Peter, who has been chief executive of the company since last
December.
   Many analysts say HBJ generates enough cash to meet its interest
obligations over the next 18 months to two years.
   But they have warned that trouble could develop in 1992 when
cash payments start coming due on preferred stock and bonds which
now are issuing additional securities as dividends.
   They say the company will have to either sell assets, reschedule
debt payments or get a capital infusion to meet those obligations.

   Americans poured $629 million into U.S.
savings bonds in July, a 4 percent increase over their investment a
year earlier and a 2 percent gain over June, the government
reported Tuesday.
   The Treasury Department said July's purchases brought total
sales for the first 10 months of fiscal year 1990 to $6.58 billion,
up from $6.57 billion during the same period of 1989.
   It also brought to $122.55 billion the value of savings bonds
now held by Americans, 7 percent more than a year ago.
   Savings bonds held 5 years or longer earn market-based interest
rates or a guaranteed rate, whichever is higher. The current
semi-annual market-based rate is 7.01 percent, effective through
Oct.31. The guaranteed rate is 6 percent.

   Stocks stumbled through a choppy session Tuesday
but several market indicators eked out small gains.
   The selling wave that pounded Wall Street Monday _ producing the
worst performance since the ``mini-crash'' last October _ subsided
somewhat.
   But buyers failed to flock back to the market as pessmism
prevailed in the face of an ailing economy, a mounting inflation
threat and the Middle East crisis.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lengthened its string of
losses to a sixth straight session, falling 5.70 to 2,710.64. Since
the market started sliding last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait,
the best-known market indicator has lost 188.62 points, or 6.5
percent.
   Broader market measures managed to post minor improvements.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.40 to 334.83 and the New
York Stock Exchange composite index of all its listed common stocks
added 0.13 to 183.45.
   But overall, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by
about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks as jittery
investors continued to pull money out of equities. There were 740
issues up, 845 down and 449 unchanged.
   Trading activity was heavy for a fourth session in a row. Volume
on the floor of the Big Board came to 231.58 million shares, down
slightly from 240.40 million on Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 274.71 million shares.
   Developments unfolding in the Mideast made the stock market
reverse course several times. Traders appeared to pounce on each
piece of news regarding the Iraq-Kuwait conflict.
   Word from the State Department in Washington that Iraq was
increasing its troop readiness on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi
Arabia increased the edginess in financial markets. A rumor, later
denied, that Iraq had invaded Saudi Arabia temporarily incited
heavy selling.
   Oil and related stocks were particularly sensitive to
fluctuations in petroleum futures, which have soared amid the
Mideast turmoil. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude settled at $28.31 a barrel, up 26 cents after
swinging widely.
   Investors took advantage of the recent runup in oil stocks to
sell and collect profits Tuesday. The selloff in a few blue chip
oil stocks accounted for virtually all of the drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   Texaco topped the Big Board's list of active issues as more than
11.4 million shares changed hands in dividend-related maneuvers. It
fell &rsqb; to 64|. Other losers in the oil sector included: Exxon, down
\ to 53&rsqb;; Mobil, down { to 67{; and Chevron, down } to 78|.
   Among the active blue chips, Philip Morris jumped 1&lsqb; to 45&lsqb;,
General Electric gained 1\ to 67\, Boeing rose 1{ to 52, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph advanced 1 to 35&rsqb; and International Business
Machines fell ~ to 103.
   For the most part, foreign stock markets steadied Tuesday, which
helped to restore calm in the United States.
   The London stock market staged a partial rebound and the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 15.6 points, or
0.7 percent, to 2,235.8.
   But in oil-dependent Japan, stocks continued to suffer. The
225-share Nikkei Stock Average dropped 946.46 points, or 3.31
percent, to close at 27,653.07.
   Japan is particularly vulnerable to oil shocks because it
imports almost all of its oil. The Japanese market has dropped
nearly 3,200 points since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $2.60 billion, or 0.08
percent, in value.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.36 to 395.10. The
NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 2.04 to
402.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
closed at 339.84, off 0.43.

<HEAD>Sony Plans to Market Its Blank Videotapes to Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. plans an expensive consumer-oriented
advertising campaign to support its new line of blank videotapes,
the company said Tuesday. Sony declined to say how much it intended
to spend on the campaign, but it said it would exceed the estimated
$4 million to $5 million all the major brands combined spent on
advertising blank tapes last year.
   Sony estimated U.S. blank tape sales amount to $750 million a
year industrywide.
   The company said its consumer-oriented ad approach, which will
use television and magazines such as People and TV Guide, breaks
with the industry's practice of aiming advertising mainly at tape
dealers.
   ``Video tape has been treated as a commodity item and that has
resulted in disenchanted dealers, confused consumers and sluggish
sales,'' said John Bermingham, president of domestic sales and
marketing for Sony Magnetic Products Group of America.
   He said Sony's advertising for its new ``V'' tapes is designed
to give the Sony tapes a brand personality that consumers will
recognize.
   The new line of tapes provide better picture quality,
durability, sound and performance, the company claimed.
   The tapes will be available at authorized dealers later this
month and the ad campaign will start in September, the company said.

<HEAD>KCPL Fires Another Legal Shot at Takeover Target KG&amp;E</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. has filed an
amended court complaint accusing takeover target Kansas Gas and
Electric Co. of violating federal Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations since the takeover was announced.
   KCPL filed the complaint Monday altering its pending lawsuit
against KG&amp;E in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo.
   KCPL requested a court order declaring its tender offer legal
and requiring KG&amp;E to provide a shareholder list and call a special
meeting of stockholders. KCPL also asked that KG&amp;E be required to
file with the SEC a more complete response to KCPL's proposal.
   KG&amp;E refused comment on the new court action.
   ``Really, we cannot discuss these issues outside the courts,''
said Lyle Koerper, a KG&amp;E spokesman.
   On July 23, KCPL launched a $27-per-share cash tender offer for
KG&amp;E, a bid worth about $857 million.
   KG&amp;E is fighting the takeover. It has refused to provide a list
of shareholders and declined to call a stockholder meeting, saying
KCPL hasn't met the requirements to force either request. Kansas
Gas claims KCPL's acquisition attempt needs SEC approval.
   KCPL's amendment to its lawsuit asserts KG&amp;E knows prior SEC
approval isn't necessary.
   The suit also attacks KG&amp;E's release of an eight-page
question-and-answer list to employees, stockholders and the news
media. KCPL claims the release violated SEC regulations concerning
solicitations and recommendations during a tender offer.
   KCPL also claims KG&amp;E's formal SEC filing responding to KCPL's
offer fails to include the basis for some conclusions drawn, in
violation of SEC requirements.
   The suit charges that the question-and-answer sheet falsely
disparages the KCPL offer and hints that KCPL could terminate KG&amp;E
pension plans and labor agreements.
   KCPL also claims that the SEC filing doesn't disclose KG&amp;E has
been involved in a massive stock repurchase program that has bought
back more than 9 million shares.
   In addition, KCPL accused Wilson Cadman, KG&amp;E president and
chairman, of making false public statements when he talked about
KG&amp;E's excess generating capacity being a ``gold mine.''
   ``Mr. Cadman failed to disclose that KG&amp;E has had excess
capacity for a number of years, has for several years attempted
unsuccessfully to sell generating capacity and has demonstrated no
ability to do so and has been unable to capitalize on this `gold
mine,''' the KCPL suit said.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Rally as Economic Fears Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures prices surged Tuesday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting an easing of economic worries linked to the
Middle East crisis, strength in the cash cattle markets and
chart-inspired buying.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures ended mixed; petroleum
futures were mixed; precious metals were mostly lower; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   News from the Middle East remained a major influence in many
commodity markets but signs during the day that hostilities were
cooling allowed traders to focus on other factors as well.
   Live cattle futures settled .28 cent to 1.15 cents higher in
Chicago with the contract for delivery in August at 77.77 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.12 cent higher with August
at 89.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .95 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with August at 58.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.40 cent lower to .52 cent higher with August at 51.07 cents a
pound.
   Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the inflation and recession fears caused by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait had had a depressing effect on cattle
prices recently because consumers would tend to bypass beef in
favor of cheaper meats if the economy took a downturn.
   ``When you start comparing beef with chicken at the meat
counters, you know which is going to get the nod,'' he said.
   But cattle prices bounced back strongly Tuesday as the stock and
crude-oil markets steadied amid indications the Iraqi government
had assumed a less aggressive posture.
   Further support stemmed from stronger packer demand for live
cattle and stonger demand for feeder cattle by feedlot operators.
   Paul Hare, livestock analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in
Chicago, said the live cattle market was oversold and due for a
correction after falling for four straight days.
   Crude oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange was
relatively calm after several days of skyrocketing prices.
   In the gasoline and heating oil markets, the contracts for
deferred deliveries, which are restricted in their movements by
exchange-enforced limits, rose most sharply in an attempt to catch
up with the limitless near-month contracts.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released
weekly supply figures showing a steeper-than-expected decline in
U.S. stocks of crude oil and an unexpected increase in gasoline
supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 89 cents lower to
$1.50 higher with September at $28.31 a barrel; heating oil was .41
cent lower to 4 cents higher with September at 75.14 cents per
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .87 cent to 4 cents higher with
September at 82.39 cents per gallon.
   Gold and silver futures settled mostly lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange after a day of back-and-forth trading in
reaction to rumors about the Iraq-Kuwait conflict.
   A report that Iraq was holding 39 Americans in a Baghdad hotel
and concerns about possible U.S. retaliation contributed to
nervousness in the gold market, said Bette Raptopoulos, senior
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``They've been responding to every little rumor and every little
story,'' she said.
   Gold futures settled 10 cents higher to 70 cents lower with
August at $384.50 a troy ounce; silver futures settled 3.2 cents to
3.5 cents lower with August at $4.857 an ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade as signs of easing tensions in the Middle East
reduced inflationary pressures.
   Traders also began evening up their positions ahead of
Thursday's Agriculture Department crop report, analysts said.
   The report, scheduled for release after Thursday's close, will
contain the government's first official estimates of 1990 U.S. corn
and soybean production.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with
September at $2.81\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 3 cents
higher with September at $2.54 a bushel; oats were { cent to }
cents higher with September at $1.17\ a bushel; soybeans 2{ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with August at $5.95{ a bushel.

   Oil prices moved higher again Tuesday as
prospects of curtailed supplies from the Middle East triggered
frantic trading amid market rumors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate climbed 26 cents to settle at $28.31 a
42-gallon barrel.
   It was the highest level for the the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude since Dec. 6, 1985, when the price reached $28.74 per barrel,
the Merc said.
   Among refined petroleum products, wholesale unleaded gasoline
was up 0.87 cent to 82.39 cents a gallon. Later contract months
showed sharper gains.
   The September contract for wholesale home heating oil settled
0.41 cent lower to 75.14 cents, but later contract months soared
the 4-cent daily limit.
   The increases were smaller than in recent days, indicating some
selling to take profits. Prices fluctuated in near-record volume in
trading for crude oil contracts.
   ``It's hard to envision a more bullish scenario than what we
have now _ the potential that two of the largest producers in the
Persian Gulf could go to war,'' said Andrew Lebow, an energy
futures analyst with E.D.F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Lebow said unconfirmed rumors _ including ones that Iraq had
invaded Saudi Arabia _ drove the market up and down fitfully.
   The market opened calmer than expected on word that Iraqi leader
Sadaam Husein would allowe foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq to leave,
a statement that calmed the markets.
   Also bearish for the market was a report that Assistant U.S.
Energy Secretary John Easton told Congress the government is
prepared to use its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the event of a
severe supply interruption.
   After trading closed on the Merc, the United States said
American troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia as part of a
multinational force to defend the country.
   Among other products, natural gas settled down 1.11 cents to
$1.447 per million British thermal units.

   Persian Gulf war rumors raced through the financial world
Tuesday, pushing oil prices toward $29 a barrel and sending more
jolts through markets for U.S. stocks and bonds.
   Increasing indications of a possible Iraq-U.S. showdown in the
vital oil-producing region transfixed professional investors and
speculators through most of the day and made many markets seesaw
without warning.
   Each suggestion of a conflict sent oil prices higher and stocks
and bonds lower on the theory that a fresh blanket of oil-shock
inflation would wallop the already weak U.S. economy. Conversely,
rumors that the situation was easing weakened oil prices and sent
money back into the stock and bond markets.
   Although many traders said the panicky psychology that had
gripped the markets since Iraq seized Kuwait last week seemed to
subside, others said widespread fear and anxiety persisted.
   ``It's an emotional, volatile market,'' said William Veronda, a
fixed-income strategist at the Denver investment firm Financial
Programs Inc.
   The United States announced after domestic markets closed that
it was deploying American troops as part of a multinational force
in Iraq's key neighbor, Saudi Arabia. Oil brokers said that
development escalated the prospects of fighting and likely would
push oil prices higher when trading resumed.
   The oil market again was the key influence on other markets
worldwide, affecting trillions of dollars in investments.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a widely followed barometer
of prices, the cost of key West Texas Intermediate crude for
September delivery gyrated throughout the day, falling as much as
$1.55 a barrel to $26.50 and jumping as high as $1 a barrel to
$29.05.
   The price settled at $28.31 a barrel by the close of trading, up
26 cents from Monday and up more than 40 percent from a week ago.
The close was the highest since $28.74 on Dec. 6, 1985, according
to Mercantile Exchange records. Other blends of crude and refined
products such as gasoline and heating oil also rose, though not as
sharply as in recent days.
   Michael Broder, vice president of the energy futures group at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York, said the market's behavior
was dictated almost entirely by ``the uncertainty over what's
happening in the Middle East.''
   On Wall Street, stocks escaped the large-scale drubbing they
took Monday. But brokers said buying interest was poor, reflecting
underlying fears about the consequences of higher oil prices.
   The Dow average ended down 5.70 points to 2,710.64, its sixth
straight loss. Overall, the number of losing stocks slightly
outnumbered advances in heavy trading.
   Prices had plunged Monday and the Dow Jones industrial average
fell more than 93 points, its worst one-day slide since the
minicrash of last October.
   Prices also fell Tuesday in the bond market, a barometer of
interest rates and economic health. The weakness especially
affected long-term bonds, reflecting investor fear that higher
inflation would erode their value.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell about $6 per $1,000
face amount, while its yield rose to 8.86 percent from 8.80 percent
late Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei Stock Average of
225 selected issues regained some of the ground it lost Tuesday
when it dropped 946.46 points to 27,653.07, its lowest level in
almost 22 months.
   ``Basically, what's happened over the past week or so is that
people have become more pessimistic about inflation in the U.S.
economy,'' said Giulio Martini, an economist with the Sanford C.
Bernstein investment firm in New York. ``What you conclude about
this episode depends on where you think the price of oil will
settle.''
   In foreign exchange, the dollar ended higher against all major
currencies except the German mark. Traders attributed the rise to a
belief that short-term U.S. interest rates, which directly affect
the dollar's value, were likely to remain stable for the time being.
   Gold prices, which moved sharply higher in recent days because
of the metal's historic value as a hedge against inflation, ended
the day little changed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $384.50 a troy ounce, down
20 cents from Monday.

<HEAD>Hoechst Celanese Corp. Earnings Drop 19 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOMERVILLE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoechst Celanese Corp.'s second-quarter
earnings dropped 19.3 percent, the chemical company said Tuesday.
   The company said soft housing and automobile markets would
continue to depress earnings in the second half of the year.
   For the April-June period, earnings were $67 million on sales of
$1.5 billion compared to earnings of $83 million on revenue of $1.6
billion in the same period in 1989.
   Second quarter sales declined in three of the company's four
major divisions _ 13.4 percent in chemicals; 3.2 percent in fibers
and film; and 1.1 percent in plastic materials.
   Sales increased 13 percent to $156 million in the life sciences
division in the second quarter. Last year, the life science's
division's sales were $138 million in the second quarter.
   For the first six months of the year, earnings dropped 25.7
percent compared to the first half of 1989. Earnings were $110
million on sales of $2.8 billion compared to earnings of $148
million on sales of $3 billion for the first six months of last
year.
   Hoechst Celanese is not publicly traded in the United States. It
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the West German chemical giant,
Hoechst AG, which posted sales of $24 billion last year, Norton
said.
