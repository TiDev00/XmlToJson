<HEAD>Iran Moves To Curb A Baby Boom That Threatens Its Economic Future</HEAD>

   Iran's government is intensifying a birth
control program _ despite opposition from radicals _ because the
country's fast-growing population is imposing strains on a
struggling economy.
   ``If the Islamic Republic's government does not implement proper
and swift plans for controlling population growth in Iran, future
generations will definitely face severe social and economic
problems,'' Tehran's Kayhan International newspaper warned recently.
   ``Can we be proud of a nation of hungry Moslems who have to beg
the infidels of the world for charity?'' declared Mohammed Yazdi, a
member of the 12-member Council of Guardians, a legislative
watchdog body.
   Iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world, between
3.5 and 4 percent a year. Even in the Middle East, where soaring
populations are the norm, Iran's baby boom is fast outstripping
development.
   Before the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran had about 35 million
people. Last`month, the government's chief statistician, Majid
Shamshidi, said the population had reached 55 million.
   Experts estimate that by the year 2010, Iran will have 140
million people. They warn that unless something is done soon to
curb the birth rate and rapidly expand the economy, the country
faces a major social explosion.
   While Iran struggles to cope with its baby boom, rival Iraq is
striving to expand its population to keep up with the Iranians
should the Iran-Iraq war, halted by an August 1988 cease-fire,
flare up again.
   Iraq has about 16 million people and President Saddam Hussein
has declared increasing its birth rate a ``strategic duty.'' He
offers hefty financial incentives, including cash grants and
interest-free home-purchase loans.
   Iran launched a half-hearted birth control campaign last year,
with some religious leaders encouraging Iran's predominantly Moslem
population to have fewer children. Now Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has declared that birth control is not
un-Islamic, although abortion is illegal.
   The Health Ministry has announced it has set up centers in major
cities to provide free contraceptives. But these have been reported
in short supply.
   Some newspapers say that unless more is done to get the message
across, the government`program will have little impact on Iranians,
who have traditionally favored large families.
   The English-language Tehran Times called last month for a media
campaign to warn Iranians of the danger of unrestrained population
growth ``to bring this immense problem ... under control.''
   Kayhan International declared: ``This phenomenon should be
seriously and properly dealt with. Using economic incentives, the
government should encourage Iranian couples to have only two
children.''
   One of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's most important priorities
is expanding the economy to at least five times its current size to
accommodate the anticipated population growth.
   As it is, western economists believe the economy, plagued by bad
management during the revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq, is
already severely stretched and needs massive investment just to
cope with the current crisis.
   Rafsanjani's rivals oppose birth control. They believe that the
larger Iran's population the greater its chances`of becoming the
undisputed leader of the Moslem world.
   By the year 2020, demographers estimate that the Moslem
population will be 2.5 billion, double the present total and more
than one-quarter of the projected world population in the first
quarter of the next century.
   The Third World, which would account for more than 80 percent of
the projected world population then, would provide fertile ground
for the Islamic revolution, the hard-liners argue.
   When a 1986 census showed 11 million Iranians had been born
since the revolution, then-Prime Minister Hussein Musavi publicly
rejoiced that they had been raised to the credo of ``Death to
America!'' and ``Allah-o Akbar!'' or God is`Great.
   The radical Jomhuri Islami daily noted recently amid a broadside
of press criticism of birth control: ``The problem is not the
increasing population, but the lack of policy and planning and in
the end it is the unfortunate population that gets the blame.''
   Rafsanjani's post-war development plan calls for building 12
industrial cities in five years`to help absorb the swelling
population.
   Tehran's population has swollen to an estimated 8 million in
recent years amid a widespread drift from the countryside to urban
areas. Officials`say the city is bursting at the seams, with
housing, water and electricity shortages, traffic-clogged streets
and worsening pollution.
   Oil-rich Iran was able to feed itself 10 years ago, but now has
to import food worth $2 billion a year.
   Agricultural output has slumped severely. In 1979, one-third of
the population worked in that sector. Now government figures show
it's only one-fifth.

<HEAD>With PM-Social Security Bjt</HEAD>

   Here are some changes in Social Security
benefits and taxes that take effect with the new year:
   BENEFITS: Monthly benefit checks increase 4.7 percent to offset
the effects of inflation. The average retired worker's Social
Security check will rise from $541 to $566. The increase also
applies to recipients of Supplemental Security Income.
   PAYROLL TAX: The tax rate rises from 7.51 percent to 7.65
percent. Employees will pay $765 for each $10,000 of earnings
subject to tax.
   TAX ON SELF-EMPLOYED: The rate rises to 15.30 percent. In 1989,
the rate technically was 15.02 percent but the self-employed got an
automatic 2 percent tax credit, so they paid 13.02 percent. They
lose the 2 percent credit in 1990, but get to deduct half of Social
Security taxes as a business expense.
   WAGE BASE: Workers and self-employed individuals will pay Social
Security taxes on the first $51,300 of earnings in 1990, up from
$48,000 in 1989.
   MEDICARE PREMIUM: Elderly and disabled workers will be charged
$28.60 a month in 1990 for supplementary Medicare coverage, down
from $31.90 in 1989. The decrease reflects the repeal of
catastrophic health-care benefits. Medicare premiums are deducted
directly from Social Security checks.
   EARNINGS LIMIT: Social Security will allow beneficiaries ages 65
through 69 to earn $9,360 a year before reducing their benefits, up
from $8,880 in 1989. Those younger than 65 will be able to earn
$6,840 without losing benefits, up from $5,480 in 1989.
   Benefits for those 65 to 69 will be reduced $1 for every $3
earned above the limit; the reduction will be $1 for every $2 above
the limit for those younger than 65. Beneficiaries who are 70 years
and older can earn unlimited amounts without losing Social Security
benefits.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Ceasescu and Noriega Mixed Power with Opulence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years ago, it was Imelda's shoes that
caused the fuss. Now, it's Elena's shoes.
   There's something about political power that breeds
extravagance, a lesson reinforced by the trappings of wealth left
behind last week by fleeing despots in both Romania and Panama.
   When the Marcoses were forced out of the Philippines, Imelda
Marcos' shoe collection _ enough for her to change daily for nine
years without wearing the same pair twice _ was the talk of Manila.
   The pattern is much the same nowadays in Bucharest, where Elena
Ceasescu boasted a wardrobe featuring shoes with diamond-encrusted
heels one day, only to find herself in front of a firing squad
before she could say, ``Hey, wait a second.''
   In Panama, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega also cut few corners in
pursuit of the good life. He had an array of houses and apartments
in Panama, France and the Dominican Republic, a collection of
personal aircraft and three large pleasure yachts _ ``Macho I,
Macho II and Macho III.''
   ``We live in a normal apartment, just like every other
citizen,'' Elena Ceasescu told a military court during her closed
trial.
   That's not what Romania's new authorities found when they turned
up at the Ceasescu residence. Instead of a ``normal apartment,''
they discovered a 40-room mansion crammed with valuable paintings,
exquisite fountains and gold-plated fixtures in the bathrooms.
Every room had a television and a videocasette player.
   ``We had no palaces. The palaces belong to the people,'' the
ousted president, Nicolae Ceasescu, told the military tribunal.
   Some of the Ceausescus' diversions seemed tame compared with
Noriega's. The new Romanian authorities came across English
instruction tapes, tennis courts and a volleyball court in the
presidential compound.
   Noriega, on the other hand, was discovered to have red underwear
to ward off evil spirits, paraphernalia for the practice of voodoo,
a collection of pornographic pictures and a sizeable quantity of
cocaine.
   Few absolute rulers seem to have been able to resist the lure of
high-living. When Mrs. Marcos fled the Malacanang Palace in Manila
in 1986, investigators dicovered a bill for an evening gown and six
silk dresses that came to $107,000, roughly 19 times Marcos' annual
presidential salary of $5,700.
   Former Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled the same
month as Marcos, was worth an estimated $400 million.
   The late Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza built up a
fortune worth about $100 million through investments in
prostitution, gambling and construction, according to Walter
LaFeber, a historian.
   The Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo controlled 111
companies at the time of his death in 1961 and was worth about $500
million, says biographer Robert Crassweller. Trujillo once
reportedly spent $80,000 on a gown for his daughter Angelita. Its
train was 75 feet long.
   The ranks of showy strongmen have diminished lately with the
accelerating trend toward democracy. Emperor Bokassa I, who spent
$20 million on his coronation 1976, is a dim memory to his former
subjects in the Central African Republic.
   But one high-liver who still survives is Mobutu Sese Seko,
president of Zaire, a pro-U.S. stalwart in Central Africa whose
worth is believed to range between $3 billion and $5 billion. He
has a number of houses abroad and has 11 palaces in Zaire alone.
   Next to the Sultan of Brunei, though, Mobutu deals in small
change. The Sultan, with an estimated worth of $28 billion, has a
palace with 1,788 rooms, including more than 200 bathrooms. The
Ceasescus' existence almost seemed pedestrian by comparison.

   Here is the text of President Bush's televised
New Year's message to the Soviet Union:
   On behalf of the American people, my wife Barbara, and my
family, I bring you our warmest greetings.
   A new year is dawning around the world, the first year of the
last decade of the 20th Century. And as the world looks back to
nine decades of war, of strife, of suspicion, let us also look
forward _ to a new century, and a new millennium, of peace, freedom
and prosperity.
   Of course, there are no maps to lead us where we are going, to
this new world of our own making. We can find our way only through
cooperation beginning with a candid dialogue. It is in pursuit of
such a dialogue that I met your president, Mikhail Gorbachev, near
the island-nation of Malta. Let me share with you some of the
matters we discussed.
   First, we agreed to redouble our efforts to diminish the
horrible threat from weapons of mass destruction; and to pursue,
with other nations, an agreement to reduce conventional forces in
Europe.
   Second, we talked about ways we can end regional conflicts and
alleviate the terrible toll in human suffering they bring.
   Third, I want to assure you, as I did your president, that the
West seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes underway in
the East.
   We talked about the magnificent efforts of the people of Eastern
Europe to find a free and democratic future. And I told your
president that I support the dynamic process of reform in the
Soviet Union. We will work together to reduce barriers to trade,
investment and the free movement of goods and ideas.
   In these ways _ and as your economic reforms take place _ the
entry of the Soviet Union into the global market can be advanced _
an historic goal that, once achieved, can improve the life of every
Soviet citizen.
   But it is our belief that lasting peace and prosperity comes
from a respect for human rights and the sharing of democratic
values that are deeply rooted in the human spirit. Your own Leo
Tolstoy said that if our hearts are empty, no law or political
reform can fill them. The real law lives within our hearts.
   These values are not exclusively American or Western. They are
not the possession of any people or any domain. They belong to all
men and women, through all time, and in all places. They are the
inalienable rights of man.
   Of course, much remains to be done. But the progress of the past
year gives me confidence that we are heading in the right
direction. In this, President Gorbachev has been a good partner in
peace.
   Given the warn-torn history of this century, we should redouble
our efforts to forge a new century of peace and freedom. Our
nations have produced Abraham Lincoln, Leo Tolstoy, Martin Luther
King, and Andrei Sakharov.
   We have persevered as allies in a terrible war. The challenges
we face today are no less daunting, but with the goodwill and
determination on both sides I am confident our two peoples will be
equal to the task.
   Thank you, God bless you, and have a Happy New Year.

   A demolition worker was buried under several
tons of rubble when seven stories of a parking garage partially
collapsed in the downtown area.
   Authorities identified the trapped worker as Basilio Barrios,
36, and said rescue crews prepared to use an 80-ton crane to dig
him from 10 to 20 feet of rubble.
   Two other workers escaped on their own and a third was freed a
short time later by District of Columbia firemen, authorities said.
   Battalion Chief Bill Embrey of the D.C. Fire Department said, ``
We will stay here as long as it takes to get him out.''
   Fire officials worked carefully to rescue Barrios but estimated
the operation will take time because the building is unstable and
could collapse more. Investigators are looking into the matter.
   Authorities said the workers were performing routine demolition
work on the second floor of the parking garage. Two stories had
been previously removed from the nine-story structure.
   Barrios was believed to be cutting through a length of steel on
the second floor of the garage when several stories of concrete
began crashing down. Authorities said there is little hope that he
survived.
   After the building collapse, workers brought in a police dog to
help search for Barrios' body. The dog recovered the hose to the
torch Barrios had been holding, officials said.
   A relative at the scene said Barrios came to the United States
about a year ago from Guatemala to make money for his wife and five
children he left behind. Barrios had planned to return to Guatemala
in June, the relative said.

<HEAD>Murder Charges May Break The Noriega Deadlock</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government plans to charge Manuel
Antonio Noriega with murder and other common crimes may break a
week-old deadlock between Washington and the Vatican over custody
of the deposed strongman.
   President Bush says he wants Noriega behind bars in the United
States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. Panama's
President Guillermo Endara, sworn as U.S. troops invaded to oust
Noriega, has indicated he's not too eager to have the military
ruler turned asylum-seeker remain in Panama.
   But the Vatican, in whose embassy Noriega sought sanctuary Dec.
24 and greeted the New Year, has made it clear it is reluctant to
turn out the general until all the niceties of diplomacy and
international law are fulfilled.
   Up to now, the main stumbling block has been the Vatican's
insistence that it cannot hand over Noriega to the United States,
which it considers an ``occupying power'' in Panama.
   It says it considers its embassy accredited to deal only with
the Panamanian government, which it insists has not made a formal
request for custody of Noriega.
   It has similarly indicated there are the centuries-old
traditions of political asylum and church sanctuary to safeguard,
both of which could be obviated in the case of common crimes _ with
the Vatican having the privilege of deciding.
   So far, the Vatican has granted Noriega temporary asylum and it
has not ruled out turning him over to Panama, saying in a statement
Saturday it ``did not intend to block the course of justice
regarding a person accused of serious crimes.''
   In what appeared to be an attempt to break the deadlock,
Attorney General Roglio Cruz announced Sunday that Endara's
government was preparing to charge Noriega with the murder of 10
officers of the now disbanded Defense Forces.
   The officers were all involved in an Oct. 3 coup attempt against
Noriega and were tortured and executed after surrendering, Cruz
told a news conference.
   Later Sunday, about 200 people gathered two blocks from the
Vatican mission _ which is surrounded by U.S. troops and armor _
and stood in silent vigil holding lighted candles. They said they
came to pray that Noriega be brought to justice.
   Cruz told reporters that the government of Endara, who was
elected in May in balloting nullified by Noriega, would request the
ousted general's custody ``Tuesday or before''.
   And ``Yes, there is evidence'' to implicate Noriega directly
with the officers' deaths, Cruz said in response to a question.
   Even Panama's Roman Catholic clergy wants Noriega brought to
justice. A dozen bishops have written Pope John Paul II urging that
he be handed over for trial in Panama or the United States and
calling him ``the author of abominable crimes.''
   As Cruz told it, a preliminary investigation showed that during
the coup attempt, forces led by Maj. Moises Giroldi, chief of
Noriega's security company in the Defense Headquarters, captured
Noriega.
   Noriega negotiated with his captors, and eventually loyalist
forces attacked the Defense Forces headquarters, forcing the rebels
to surrender. Noriega's regime announced the next day that 10 of
the rebels, including Giroldi, had been killed in the fighting.
   The 10 were ``executed after they surrendered in a place away
from the site where they gave up,'' Cruz said.
   ``When the coup failed, Giroldi and the others were promised
personal safety. But then he was taken by helicopter to the base at
the airport and then from there to the military base at Tinajitas,
where he was tortured, shot in the kneecaps and elbows and then
shot to death,'' a Panamanian officer involved in the investigation
said.
   The officer, who insisted on anonymity, told The Associated
Press that ``a lieutenant who at one time shoved Noriega into a
truck at the beginning of the coup had his hands cut off, and then
he was shot.''
   Another officer, Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo, whose body was returned
to his family with a report saying he had died of asphyxiation,
also was tortured. ``They put a hood over his head and then beat
him and choked him until he died,'' the source said.
   Cruz said indictments were also are being prepared against the
Noriega-dominated Electoral Council for trying ``to block the
orderly renewal of government powers'' by illegally annulling the
May 7 national elections. Noriega may be involved in that one, too.
   Although he was only the Defense Forces chief at the time,
Noriega wielded absolute power behind the scenes. International
observers said the elections were annulled when returns showed
Endara's slate won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   The new government was to have taken office Sept. 1 along with a
new National Legislature. But Noriega had the old legislature name
Francisco Rodriguez, a crony of his, provisional president before
that date.
   And then, less than a week before the Dec. 20 invasion, Noriega
had himself named by a rump legislature made up to municipal mayors
``maximum leader'' with virtually absolute power, saying Panama was
in ``a state of war'' with the United States.

<HEAD>Chief Justice Says More Judges Needed To Fight Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. courts need more judges, particularly in
border regions burdened with a heavy load of drug cases, says Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   ``From the federal law enforcement perspective, the war on drugs
will fail if the judiciary is not given the judgeships necessary to
do the job,'' the Supreme Court chief said Sunday in his annual
year-end report on the federal court system.
   ``Some courts, especially in border states, are approaching the
outer limits of caseload and fatigue from handling drug-related
cases,'' he said, noting that one in four criminal cases handled by
the federal courts is drug-related.
   Rehnquist urged Congress to ``take immediate action'' to create
the 59 additional trial judgeships and 16 more appellate judgeships
requested last October by the U.S. Judicial Conference, the
policy-making arm of the federal court system. Rehnquist heads the
conference.
   To date, Congress has authorized 575 federal trial judgeships
and 168 appellate judgeships. No new judgeship has been created
since 1984.

<HEAD>1989 Police Death Toll Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll among police officers killed in
the line of duty fell to 97 in 1989, down from 167 in 1988, says
the National Association of Chiefs of Police.
   Fifty officers died of gunshot wounds, 32 in traffic accidents,
eight in plane crashes and seven others in stabbings, fights or
other incidents on duty, the group said Sunday.
   ``Increased use of bullet resistant jackets and the upgraded
training in law enforcement agencies, we believe, has played a role
in reversing a trend that we thought would never end regarding the
deaths of law enforcement officers,'' David Waud, the association's
chief of staff services, said in a statement.
   The average age of officers killed was 27 in 1989. The most
dangerous day, on average, was Thursday and the most dangerous
hours, between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.
   Texas led the count with 11 officers killed, followed by New
York and Florida, each with eight, and Mississippi and California,
each with seven.

   Rock star John Cougar Mellencamp says he

   Mellencamp, 37, who lives in the Bloomington area, evolved from

``Scarecrow,'' which came out two years later.

``I feel at odds with the government all the time, like I think
most people do, but I don't sit down and make a political record.
   ``I guess `Scarecrow' was political because of that one song,
`Rain on the Scarecrow.' I'm sure the song's not going to change
the world. It might make people think about it a little bit,'' he
said.
   The song became a hit at a time family farmers nationwide faced
a growing threat of foreclosure, and Mellencamp has become one of
the main figures behind the Farm Aid concerts.

   Letter turner Vanna White was among the
guests when talk and game show host Pat Sajak tied the knot with
former Playboy model Lesly Brown.
   Sajak, 42, married Brown, 24, in a 40-minute ceremony Sunday at
St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church. There was little information
available about the ceremony because the couple sold exclusive
rights to the nuptials to People magazine.
   Brown is a University of Maryland graduate and former Miss
Georgetown who appeared in Playboy magazine's 1988 ``Women of
Washington'' feature.
   She met the host of ``The Pat Sajak Show'' and ``Wheel of
Fortune'' at the celebrity opening of a restaurant in Irvine,
Calif., in 1988.

   Bo Schembechler is beginning to reflect
on what life might be like without football and without the
University of Michigan.
   In an interview Sunday on the eve of the Rose Bowl game,
Schembechler said he intends to resign soon as athletic director.
   He announced his plans to step down as coach before the
Wolverines came to the West Coast. The game today against the
University of Southern California will be his last.
   ``This is not easy for me to do,'' he said. ``When you've been
in the thick of the fray, you don't want to just fade into the
background. What I need when this is done is a new challenge,
something exciting.''
   Schembechler, the winningest active Division I-A coach with 234
victories, said any new job would have to keep him busy.
   ``That's the way I've lived my life. I'll have to have things to
do. I hope I won't have to travel as much. I'm not retiring from
work, only from coaching.''

   At Carlos Foster's stable in the Bronx, young
cowfolk looking to rope and ride don't just horse around _ they
earn their spurs by staying in school and away from the
drug-infested streets.
   The Happy Trails Stables is where Foster, 67, and his hired
hands in the Urban Western Riding Program teach inner-city youths
trick-riding, calf-roping and much more.
   ``I use the horse as a substitute for drugs. With the horse I
can stop them from playing hooky and from doing drugs,'' Foster
said recently from atop his palomino, Santiago.
   Happy Trails Stables isn't a ranch of wide-open spaces; the din
of passing traffic and the shadows of adjacent housing projects
intrude on the bucolic goings on.
   Within the stables, the tradition of the Old West takes
precedence.
   Youths ranging in age from 8 to 20 learn the history of the
cowboy. They brush the sweat and dirt from the horses' coats, walk
them, clean their stables, ride them in a corral.
   ``I'm giving these children the opportunity to see what lies
beyond the pressures which led him or her to substance abuse or
away from school,'' Foster said.
   Foster was busting broncos at age 5 for a quarter a shot in
Dantes Orientees, Cuba. He's lived in New York for nearly 30 years,
working waiting and cleaning jobs in the city and skipping out West
on weekends to ride the rodeo.
   He's a tall, thin cowpoke with a thick white moustache and a
crop of white hair that is always covered with a cowboy hat. He
speaks with a deep voice, his swarthy face breaking up each time he
laughs.
   The inspiration for the Urban Western Riding Program was
Foster's successful, 13-year battle against his son's heroin
addiction. He felt the skills of the Wild West could help protect
kids from urban horrors.
   He rented horses and charged for weekend riding lessons, raising
enough money to rent the corral of the Happy Trails Stables. He now
has about 200 students a year.
   Two years ago, Harry Taylor, 23, was a cocaine addict, living in
a pony trailer behind the stables until he hit bottom and asked
Foster for a job.
   ``I owe everything to Carlos because he took me under his wing
and taught me that drugs and horses don't mix, so I quit cold
turkey to keep up with this job,'' said Taylor.
   Taylor is now one of the program's instructors and has competed
in bronco busting in several rodeos.
   This year Foster and the city Board of Education co-sponsored a
curriculum for truant students from intermediate and junior high
schools in the Bronx borough of New York. Each week, 120 students
visit the stable for a three-hour riding lesson.
   Diana Ianuzzi, a teacher and counselor at Intermediate School 80
in the Bronx, said she has a hard time keeping the students calm
when the bell rings and it's time to board the bus.
   ``It's an incentive to bring up grades and enjoy school. In my
classes I can actually say within these few weeks I've seen an
improvement,'' she said.
   At the end of the school year, 50 of the children will ride
beside more than 100 professional cowboys at opening ceremonies of
a Bronx rodeo.
   Foster is retired from trick riding and calf roping, but he
intends to use Western traditions to help children for as long as
it works.
   ``If I could stop two or five kids a year from ruining their
lives, that's all I want to do the rest of my life.''

   Merrymakers tossed confetti, squawked horns and popped champagne
corks and orchestras dusted off the sheet music for another
rendition of ``Auld Lang Syne'' this morning to ring in 1990 and a
new decade.
   New York City's nationally televised ball of lights that slid
down a pillar high above Times Square to count off the waning
year's last seconds had a few rivals this time from such places as
Seattle, Houston and Atlanta.
   Police estimated 200,000 revelers ignored daylong rain and
packed Times Square, chanting in unison to count down the last
seconds of the 1980s as they watched the lighted ball slide down a
pole, just as it has most New Year's Eves since 1907.
   Nationwide, taxi companies geared up to give free rides home to
New Year's Eve revelers who over-imbibed.
   Highways were wet or icy in places from the Midwest into the
Northeast.
   The countdown Sunday night had an extra ``leap second'' to keep
the world's clocks in time with the rotation of the planet.
   Because New Year's Eve fell on a Sunday, some nightspots around
the country couldn't serve drinks.
   But in Indiana, while taverns lacking Sunday liquor licenses
were closed, restaurants and private clubs had special permission
from the Legislature to stay open until 3 a.m. instead of the usual
12:30 a.m. Sunday closing time.
   At 90 seconds before midnight, one of the outside elevator cars
on Seattle's Space Needle was to ascend, reaching the top at
midnight in a blaze of 6,500 lights. Organizers expected 15,000
people to turn out.
   In Houston, a 20-foot Texas Lone Star was rigged to rise up the
side of the Texas Commerce Tower and arrived at the top at midnight
to the accompaniment of a fireworks display choreographed to music.
Police estimated about 30,000 people watched from Houston's Market
Square.
   Not to be outdone, folks in Atlanta built a 6-foot-wide foam and
fiberglass Georgia peach and dropped it from a light tower at
midnight at the Underground Atlanta mall. Police estimated at least
80,000 revelers jammed into the mall.
   They were mere neighborhood gatherings compared to the screaming
crowd in New York's Times Square. The police assigned more than
2,700 officers, many wearing riot helmets, to the area from Sunday
evening to 4:30 a.m. Monday.
   Many area businesses took precautions in case the party got out
of control. The first floor of the Marriott Marquis Hotel was
sheathed in plywood to ward off overexuberant revelers.
   In Miami, Chubby Checker exhorted ``Feel good! Let it go! Lose
control!'' Sunday night as tens of thousands of people lining
downtown Miami streets cheered, oohed and danced to the 56th annual
King Orange Jamboree Parade.
   Cab companies in Indiana got ready for one of the busiest nights
of the year. ``It's mass chaos,'' said John McNeely, owner of
Bloomington's Yellow Cab Co. ``It's busy from the time it starts to
the time it ends.''
   McNeely expected to haul more than 1,000 riders between 7 p.m.
Sunday and 5 a.m. Monday in a Bloomington Hospital-sponsored
program that offered free rides to revelers who had too much to
drink.
   Free cab rides also were offered in Indianapolis, where no New
Year's Eve traffic deaths have been recorded since Yellow Cab began
its program in 1982.
   Fort Worth, Texas, offered its second annual First Night, an
alcohol-free celebration including a splash of performance art
along with more traditional offerings such as opera, dance and
classical music.
   Elsewhere in Texas, the big downtown fireworks display in San
Antonio had been called off because of the city's financial
problems, but corporate and individual donations put it back on the
schedule.
   And after a blast of unseasonably cold weather, the hard edges
of ice sculptures decorating Boston as part of its 14th annual
First Night festivities got rounded off Sunday under an untimely
drizzle. But despite the rain, an estimated 250,000 people showed
up to watch the midnight fireworks over Boston Harbor.

   A Titan 3 rocket carrying British
and Japanese communications satellites gave thousands of spectators
a dazzling New Year's Eve show when it roared into space after nine
postponements.
   Martin Marietta Corp. entered the commercial launch business as
the 155-foot-tall booster etched a fiery path in a star-filled sky.
   More than three hours after the 7:07 p.m. launch, officials
reported the two satellites had been deployed properly.
   Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch was delayed once by a
technical problem and eight times by strong, high altitude winds.
The wind didn't pose a problem Sunday night and the countdown
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff.
   The most powerful U.S. commercial rocket carried into space the
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites.
   JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network,
providing telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data
services. It is owned by the Japanese Communications Satellite Co.
   Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for
communicating with land, sea and air forces.
   The Japanese company and British government shared the $125
million cost of the rocket and launch services provided by Martin
Marietta.
   The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the
second big U.S. rocket to enter the commercial market. McDonnell
Douglas had the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a
communications satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in
August.
   General Dynamics plans to enter the competition in 1990 with its
Atlas rocket.
   The three U.S. companies are competing with the European Space
Agency's Ariane rocket.
   Ariane, which had a big head start on the American companies,
has signed contracts covering about half the estimated 15 to 20
launches planned annually in the next several years. That leaves
the three American companies and budding Soviet and Chinese
commercial programs to compete for the remaining contracts.
   Martin Marietta has signed on only three additional customers
for the Titan 3, but a company official said he hoped Sunday
night's success would attract new business.
   ``We feel this success firmly establishes Martin Marietta as a
major player in the world market for commercial launch business,''
said Edward M. Browne, president of the company's commercial Titan
division.

<HEAD>Eight More Cold Deaths Pushes Two-Week Toll to 60</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight more people have died of exposure
to the chilly weather gripping northern Bangladesh, bringing the
death toll from the cold snap to 60 in two weeks, newspapers said
today.
   In neighboring India, at least 61 people have died of
hypothermia in the same period.
   Itefaq, an independent Dhaka daily, said six people died Sunday
in the Panchagarh district where temperatures dropped to 36
degrees, the lowest in three decades. Two people died of the cold
in Jaipurhat district, according to Sangbad, another independent
Bengali-language newspaper.
   Most of the cold wave victims had no homes and were sleeping on
the ground.
   In Panchagarh, 220 miles north of Dhaka, the Bangladesh Red
Crescent Society, the Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, said it
was distributing warm clothing and blankets to poor people to help
them cope with the cold.
   Winter lows in northern Bangladesh usually hover around 44
degrees.
   The cold weather strikes hard at this country where the per
capita annual income is $160 and even people with shelter are
ill-prepared for winter. Most houses in Bangladesh, a country of
110 million people, have mud floors with walls fashioned from thin
mats of straw or split bamboo.

   Alf and E.T. may have liked the
idea, but few people on Earth were willing to dig deep enough to
build a $25 million welcoming station for visitors from outer space.
   Thomas L. Weber, 51, said financial problems caused him to close
the office that was the center for promoting the project.
   ``We got tens of thousands of letters, but we couldn't even
afford postage to answer the mail,'' Weber said.
   ``I guess if people had slipped $5 or $10 or $20 in each
envelope, we'd still be operating,'' he said.
   His plan called for the welcoming station to provide a safe
landing area that would accommodate visitors from other planets.
The site he selected is on hilly farmland near Elmwood in western
Wisconsin.
   However, the groundswell of financial support he expected from
those around the nation who believe in UFOs never materialized.
   Weber said he spent about $20,000 running the Site Center office.
   ``About half came out of my own pocket,'' he said. ``I and
another person were the major contributors.''

   A head-on crash killed seven people in West Texas, while fog and
ice on an Arizona highway were blamed for a series of crashes that
killed six people and injured 34.
   A pickup truck veered out of control on a hill and slammed
head-on into a car on U.S. Highway 67 about 27 miles south of
Marfa, Texas on Sunday, killing the pickup's driver and all six
people in the car, said Department of Public Safety Trooper Mark
Riordan.
   Riordan said it was the worst crash in Texas since the September
school bus crash in Alton that killed 21 students.
   In Flagstaff, Ariz., authorities said 24 people remained
hospitalized Sunday, four in critical condition, after Saturday's
62-vehicle chain pileup on Interstate 40.
   Four of the six people killed were members of one Indiana
family, state Department of Public Safety officials said.
   Lt. Carlton Hill said there were at least three separate
accident sites over a quarter-mile stretch of I-40 about five miles
east of Flagstaff.

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women are beginning to count more in
American mathematics, according to a University of Massachusetts
professor who says they earned nearly a quarter of all the math
doctorates in the last school year.
   ``It should dispel the notion once and for all that mathematics
is a man's game,'' said Professor Edward Connors, who conducts an
annual survey of the doctorates issued in the field for the
American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of
America.
   The new female doctorates, with median starting salaries of
$30,500, even made about $500 a year more than their male
classmates, Connors said.
   In 1987-88, about 21 percent of mathematics Ph.D.s went to
women, he said. In 1989 it was a little over 24 percent, with 313
men and 98 women earning doctorates in math.
   Connors said that the percentage rise was fueled both by
increasing numbers of women going on to graduate work in math and
the declining numbers of American men in the field.
   For the third straight year, U.S. colleges granted more
doctorates in math to foreign students than they did to American
citizens. Out of the 904 doctorates issued in the 1988-89 school
year, 46 percent went to U.S. citizens.
   That was slightly better than in the previous year's figure of
45 percent, but the number of doctorates earned by Americans has
been declining since the 1976-77 school year, when 76 percent of
the 901 issued went to U.S. citizens, according to the survey.
   Although women have made up about half of the bachelor's degrees
awarded in math for more than a decade, traditionally they have not
gone on to advanced degrees, he said.
   ``It's hard to understand, because the world of mathematics
doesn't have the artificial barriers to women and minorities of
some of the other physical sciences where much of the work is done
in research groups,'' Connors said. ``Mathematicians are by and
large a bunch of loners. And the rest of the world regards them all
_ men and women _ as sort of different. ''
   Betty M. Vetter, who conducts surveys on women and minorities in
the sciences for the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, said it's too soon to tell whether the 1989 statistics
signal a trend.
   However, she said the higher salaries that women mathematicians
received most likely were a glitch.
   ``The only field where women have been able to hold a slight
edge in salaries over men has been engineering and that's only at
the starting level,'' Ms. Vetter said. ``The real salary problems
occur later on, because women still do not have the same
opportunities for advancement as men.''

<TEXT>
   Westminster College, where Winston S.
Churchill's ``Iron Curtain speech'' signaled the start of the Cold
War in 1946, hopes Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will deliver an
epilogue.
   ``We're hoping that a world figure who has played such a major
role in East-West politics would see the importance of returning to
the place where the Cold War was first defined,'' college president
Harvey Saunders said.
   Fulton, a community of 11,000, has asked Sen. Christopher S.
Bond, R-Mo., to help try to get Gorbachev to speak at Westminster
in June when he visits the United States for a summit meeting with
President Bush.
   While out of office as Britain's prime minister, Churchill was
persuaded by President Truman to come to Fulton to accept an
honorary degree.
   In his March 1946 lecture, Churchill said, ``From Stettin in the
Baltic, to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended
across the (European) continent.''
   The phrase drew little immediate attention from the media, but
soon it became part of the Cold War glossary.

<HEAD>Majority In Poll Favor Environment Over Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans entering the homestretch of the
20th century said they want to clean up the environment even if
economic prosperity suffers, a newspaper poll published today found.
   Respondents to the Los Angeles Times' year-end poll also opposed
legalizing drugs by a 2-1 margin, while about half said they keep a
gun at home.
   And a majority of those surveyed favored deep defense spending
cuts in light of changes in Eastern Europe, but there was little
agreement on how to divide the ``peace dividend.''
   The poll contacted by telephone a random sampling of 2,095 U.S.
adults between Dec. 16-20 and had a 3 percent margin of error in
either direction.
   By a 2-1 margin, respondents said that entering 1990 they
favored ``protecting the environment even if that means some people
will lose their jobs and the government will have to spend a great
deal of money.''
   One-half of those polled favored cutting defense spending;
one-third each supported using the money to bolster domestic social
programs, reduce the national deficit and cut taxes.
   A strong majority opposed legalizing drugs, but 3 out of 10 said
they thought that it may be the only way to bring the nation's drug
crisis under control. Most in that group were younger respondents.
   Half those surveyed said they keep at least one gun at home,
either for hunting, protection, or both.
   Euthanasia was favored by nine out of 10 polled, while one in 10
reported contemplating suicide.
   President Bush got high marks, with 73 percent saying they
approve of the job he's doing and 21 percent registering
disapproval.

   Four years ago, it was Imelda's shoes that
caused the fuss. Now, it's Elena's shoes.
   There's something about political power that breeds
extravagance, a lesson reinforced by the trappings of wealth left
behind last week by fleeing despots in both Romania and Panama.
   When the Marcoses were forced out of the Philippines, Imelda
Marcos' shoe collection _ enough for her to change daily for nine
years without wearing the same pair twice _ was the talk of Manila.
   The pattern is much the same nowadays in Bucharest, where Elena
Ceausescu boasted a wardrobe featuring shoes with diamond-encrusted
heels one day, only to find herself in front of a firing squad
before she could say, ``Hey, wait a second.''
   In Panama, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega also cut few corners in
pursuit of the good life. He had an array of houses and apartments
in Panama, France and the Dominican Republic, a collection of
personal aircraft and three large pleasure yachts _ ``Macho I,
Macho II and Macho III.''
   ``We live in a normal apartment, just like every other
citizen,'' Elena Ceausescu told a military court during her closed
trial.
   That's not what Romania's new authorities found when they turned
up at the Ceausescu residence. Instead of a ``normal apartment,''
they discovered a 40-room mansion crammed with valuable paintings,
exquisite fountains and gold-plated fixtures in the bathrooms.
Every room had a television and a videocasette player.
   ``We had no palaces. The palaces belong to the people,'' the
ousted president, Nicolae Ceausescu, told the military tribunal.
   Some of the Ceausescus' diversions seemed tame compared with
Noriega's. The new Romanian authorities came across English
instruction tapes, tennis courts and a volleyball court in the
presidential compound.
   Noriega, on the other hand, was discovered to have red underwear
to ward off evil spirits, paraphernalia for the practice of voodoo,
a collection of pornographic pictures and a sizeable quantity of
cocaine.
   Few absolute rulers seem to have been able to resist the lure of
high-living. When Mrs. Marcos fled the Malacanang Palace in Manila
in 1986, investigators dicovered a bill for an evening gown and six
silk dresses that came to $107,000, roughly 19 times Marcos' annual
presidential salary of $5,700.
   Former Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled the same
month as Marcos, was worth an estimated $400 million.
   The late Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza built up a
fortune worth about $100 million through investments in
prostitution, gambling and construction, according to Walter
LaFeber, a historian.
   The Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo controlled 111
companies at the time of his death in 1961 and was worth about $500
million, says biographer Robert Crassweller. Trujillo once
reportedly spent $80,000 on a gown for his daughter Angelita. Its
train was 75 feet long.
   The ranks of showy strongmen have diminished lately with the
accelerating trend toward democracy. Emperor Bokassa I, who spent
$20 million on his coronation 1976, is a dim memory to his former
subjects in the Central African Republic.
   But one high-liver who still survives is Mobutu Sese Seko,
president of Zaire, a pro-U.S. stalwart in Central Africa whose
worth is believed to range between $3 billion and $5 billion. He
has a number of houses abroad and has 11 palaces in Zaire alone.
   Next to the Sultan of Brunei, though, Mobutu deals in small
change. The Sultan, with an estimated worth of $28 billion, has a
palace with 1,788 rooms, including more than 200 bathrooms. The
Ceausescus' existence almost seemed pedestrian by comparison.

<HEAD>Disgraced Ex-President Shouted Down In Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Emerging from self-imposed exile,
former President Chun Doo-hwan appeared before Parliament but his
answers to questions on corruption during his tenure were drowned
out by angry, shouting lawmakers.
   During Sunday's hearings, which were broadcast to the nation,
the disgraced ex-president refused to make an outright apology, as
opposition parties have demanded, but said he would take ``moral
responsibility'' for wrongdoing under his rule.
   He has denied any personal corruption, but 48 of his relatives
and associates have been convicted of embezzlement and other crimes.
   ``I didn't do anything wrong,'' Chun said.
   ``It's a lie! It's a lie!'' one opposition lawmaker shouted as
Chun denied almost all charges of corruption, power abuse and
misdeeds.
   The testimony, which lasted more than 12 hours, was interrupted
repeatedly by shouting matches that forced adjournments and a
virtual free-for-all involving about two dozen legislators.
   A melee broke out after opposition legislators angrily accused
Chun of lying about his involvement in the crushing of a 1980 civil
uprising in the city of Kwangju. About 200 people died and 1,500
were wounded in the uprising, which was suppressed by the military.
Chun was a top general at the time and became president the same
year with military backing.
   After the hearing, Chun returned to the Buddhist temple where he
has lived in self-imposed exile since leaving office in 1988 after
a seven-year term marred by charges of corruption, human rights
abuses and misconduct.
   Aides said he would not come back to testify.
   Chun was forced to agree to democratic president elections in
1987 after months of anti-government protests. His hand-picked
successor, Roh, was elected Dec. 17, 1987 in South Korea's first
direct presidential election in 16 years.

<HEAD>Reeling From Coup Attempt, Aquino Announces Big Cabinet Reshuffle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corazon Aquino has made the most
extensive Cabinet reshuffle of her presidency less than a month
after a failed coup, changing such key posts as finance, justice
and military affairs.
   Her spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, claimed the changes announced
Sunday had not been prompted by the coup attempt _ the most serious
of her nearly four-year tenure _ but ``by the same reasons, perhaps
that precipitated the coup.''
   Public criticism had been directed at the departments of
transport, education, agriculture and agrarian reform, whose
secretaries were among those replaced in the shakeup.
   It was the most sweeping Cabinet revamp since Mrs. Aquino took
office in the February 1986 uprising that toppled the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``The thrust of these changes is the need always to adjust to
new situations to assure improved delivery of services to our
people,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a nationally televised statement.
   In her announcement, Mrs. Aquino said Jose Cuisia, administrator
of the Social Security System, would take over as Central Bank
governor.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Mariano Adalem was named presidential adviser
on military affairs, replacing retired Maj. Gen. Jose Magno. Adalem
was also appointed acting chief of the National Intelligence
Coordinating Agency.
   There had been widespread criticism of the intelligence
service's failure to predict the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, in which at
least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured.
   Mrs. Aquino retained Fidel Ramos as defense secretary despite
demands by mutineers that he be replaced. Ramos has crushed all six
coup attempts while serving as military chief of staff and later
defense secretary.
   Also retained was Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who was
widely criticized for sloppy management of a department where
former Marcos supporters hold key positions.
   Mrs. Aquino named Jesus Estanislao, former economic planning
secretary, to be secretary of finance, replacing Vicente Jayme.
   Jayme, who underwent cardiac surgery this year, was appointed
presidential adviser on economic and financial affairs.
   In other changes:
   _ Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon as secretary of justice,
replacing Sedfrey Ordonez who was named ambassador to the United
Nations;
   _ Senen Bacani, a former agribusiness executive, as secretary of
agriculture, replacing Carlos Domingez who resigned;
   _ Isidro Carino, a university president, as secretary of
education, replacing Lourdes Quisumbing, who resigned;
   Mrs. Aquino reorganized her Cabinet after coup attempts in
November 1986 and August 1987, but the changes failed to satisfy
military dissidents or lead to significant improvements in her
administration.

   Filipinos greeted the New Year with a
barrage of fireworks and gunshots in the air which left more than
1,700 injured and triggered at least five fires in the capital,
officials said.
   Explosions rocked Manila and colorful streamers roared into the
sky throughout the night, despite police warnings that they would
enforce a ban on private fireworks displays because of fears of a
new attempt to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   A spokesman for the police Capital Command said there were no
reports of anyone arrested.
   A check of 28 Manila-area hospitals showed 1,640 people were
treated for gunshots and fireworks-related injuries, including
burns and missing fingers. Forty-eight of those were wounded by
stray bullets, hospital sources said.
   In addition, hospitals in nearby Bulacan province, center of the
country's fireworks industry, reported 75 people were treated for
fireworks injuries. Most of the injured were children, officials
said.
   Last year, police said nearly 1,000 people were injured and 41
killed during New Year's revelry in Manila alone.
   Also this year, a garment factory in the Bulacan town of
Balagtas was razed when firecrackers thrown by revelers triggered a
fire. Damage was estimated at $45,000.
   Fires were reported overnight in five areas of Manila, where
most structures are made of wood. Damage was estimated at $591,000.
   In a New Year's message, Mrs. Aquino urged Filipinos to overcome
the political uncertainties of the past year and work for stability.
   On Dec. 1, thousands of military mutineers launched the sixth
and bloodiest attempt to topple the nearly four-year Aquino
administration. Key mutiny leaders, including former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, remain at large and have threatened to
continue efforts to oust Mrs. Aquino.

   Revelers frolicked on the Berlin Wall, Romanians watched their
first televised New Year's Mass in 40 years and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev declared that socialism can prosper with democracy in the
new decade that begins today.
   Festivities ranged from solemn to raucous.
   More than 2,000 people lit candles and rallied in the rain in
Hong Kong in support of democracy, expressing hope that China's
leaders would grant greater freedoms to avoid the type of bloody
revolution that convulsed Romania.
   Romanians were not the only Eastern Europeans to celebrate an
end to repressive one-party Communist rule. Poles, Hungarians, East
Germans, Czechs and Slovaks also had peaceful revolts to take pride
in.
   In the Philippines, a barrage of fireworks and gunshots in the
air left more than 1,700 people injured and triggered at least five
fires in Manila, officials said. And in London's Trafalgar Square,
at least 114 people were injured during the annual New Year's party
that drew about 70,000.
   The pope expressed joy over new religious freedom in the East
bloc, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said ``the
overwhelming lesson of the 1980s is that socialism has failed.''
   Gorbachev and President Bush exchanged televised greetings to
their respective nations. In separate comments to the Soviet
people, Gorbachev declared that true socialism is still very much
alive.
   ``The necessity to combine socialism with democracy has again
been vigorously reaffirmed in the dramatic events that occurred in
Berlin, Sofia, Prague and Bucharest,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``The postwar division of the continent recedes into the past,''
he said. ``The 1990s could become the most fruitful period in the
history of civilization.''
   Along the Berlin Wall, thousands of Germans rang in a new year
of unity at a huge party punctuated by drums, saxophones and
whistling firecrackers. Hammers clanged against chisels as souvenir
hunters mined for chunks.
   Tens of thousands of people poured from both directions through
the newly opened wall, which in the past two months has been
transformed from a symbol of suppression to one of reconciliation.
Thousands more scaled the wall and tumbled into the other Germany
as the formerly feared East German border guards watched with
amusement.
   ``The wall is open for the first time in my life. We want to
celebrate along with everyone else,'' said Hans-Juergen Witfeld,
who traveled from the Ruhr Valley city of Dortmund with eight
friends.
   A projection screen set up near the wall at the Brandenburg Gate
collapsed after midnight under the weight of revelers who had
climbed its scaffolding, killing one man and injuring more than 50,
East Germany's official ADN news agency reported.
   In Bucharest, Romanians prayed for peace, prosperity and their
new freedom, celebrating their first New Year's Eve in 24 years
without the oppressive yoke of Nicolae Ceausescu's dictatorship.
   ``Happy New Year Dignity, Happy New Year Democracy,'' the
Bucharest newspaper Truth proclaimed in a front-page headline.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, in a New Year's speech, made a
renewed commitment to multiparty democracy and pledged that the
popular revolution that toppled Ceausescu would ``remain
unvanquishable.''
   One Romanian newspaper carried a warning from police asking
holiday merrymakers not to use fireworks and noisemakers in the
capital, where the streets were filled with nervous soldiers armed
with automatic weapons.
   Romanian television broadcast a special Romanian Orthodox New
Year's Mass, celebrated by Patriarch Theocrist _ something
unthinkable for decades under harsh Communist rule.
   ``The prayers are for the freedom we have now. We have this
liberty at the price of blood,'' another cleric, Father Agatangel,
said at the same service.
   Other Romanians prepared to celebrate in traditional fashion
with cabbage rolls, drinks, family and friends. Strands of brightly
colored lights adorned some trees. Snowmen stood everywhere, many
dressed in army helmets and a few with the word ``victory'' written
with stones.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France ended the bicentennial
year of the French Revolution by celebrating ``the fall of the
other Bastilles in the Europe where dictators still ruled'' in 1989.
   ``We have just helped the most dazzling victory for democracy,''
Mitterrand said. ``1789-1989: no one could have dared to dream a
celebration like this for such a beautiful anniversary.''
   Pope John Paul II said during a Mass in Rome that 1989 had been
an ``extraordinarily important year for all humanity, and in
particular, for several European countries, which have seen new
prospects of liberty and national cohesion develop within their
borders.''
   In Brazil, more than 1 million people filled Rio's Copacabana
beach to celebrate the Feast of Iemanja, the goddess of the sea.
   Just before midnight, people lay gifts to Iemanja on the shore,
to be carried away by the waves. Some even place their offerings on
elaborately constructed rafts.
   Millions of Japanese streamed to temples and shrines to usher
out the Year of the Snake and welcome the Year of the Horse with
prayers for health and prosperity. The Oriental calendar names
years for the 12 animals that, according to legend, called on the
dying Buddha.
   Soviet cosmonauts appeared on Soviet television Saturday night
from space with a tiny tree and a doll of Grandfather Frost, the
Soviet version of Santa Claus. They said they wished they had some
champagne to toast the new year.
   But like many Soviets in this time of shortages, they had to
make do with fruit juice.

<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ibrahim Babangida today declared
a general prisoner amnesty that was expected to result in the
immediate release of thousands of inmates.
   The order, in a New Year's address to the nation, follows
criticism from a local human rights group that scores of prisoners
died in the last year due to overcrowded, unhygienic conditions.
   Babangida, in a television and radio address, ordered freed all
who have completed three-fourths of their terms, those jailed for
minor offenses whose sentences do not exceed one year and others
jailed for life but who have served more than 10 years.
   The president also ordered released those awaiting trial who
have been held in prison or police custody for more than a year,
except prisoners being held for drug-related crimes and charges of
manslaughter, murder, armed robbery and economic sabotage.
   Nigeria's leading human rights group, the Civil Liberties
Organization, has been fighting legal battles with the military
government to free inmates in pre-trial detention who at one point
in 1989 numbered about 1,000.
   Some had languished in custody untried for as long as five years.
   The organization also has lambasted the government for the
unhygienic and overcrowded conditions of the prisons and said that
in one prison alone, Lagos' Ikoyi facility, 78 inmates had died in
1989 due to poor sanitation, poor feeding and lack of adequate
medical facilities.
   The government did not say how many of Nigeria's approximately
23,000 prisoners would be released as a result of Babangida's
order, but observers estimated the number would be in the thousands.
   Babangida said the move was aimed at decongesting Nigerian
prisons, which are stuffed to almost twice their official
capacities.

<HEAD>British Artist William Scott Dies, 76</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Scott, a British artist acclaimed for his
still-life paintings and drawings of simple foods and kitchen
utensils, has died at age 76 at his home in southwest England.
   Scott, who died Thursday of Alzheimer's disease at his home
outside Bath, played a leading role in bringing British painting
back into the international mainstream after World War II isolation.
   He represented his country successfully at art festivals
throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1961, he won the international
critics' prize at the Sao Paulo Biennale.
   In 1966, he was named a Commander of the British Empire.
   The son of an Irish signwriter, Scott was born Feb. 15, 1913, in
Greenock, Scotland, and was brought up in Northern Ireland. He
studied at the Belfast College of Art and the Royal Academy of Art
in London in the late 1920s and 1930s.
   Scott initially reacted against the surrealist tendencies of the
1930s, but by the 1960s his work had become increasingly abstract.
He once described himself as belonging to ``the generation in
between'' the representational and non-representational phases of
modern art.
   He was noted above all for his paintings of objects such as
kitchen pots and pans, baskets and bottles, eggs and loaves of
bread laid out on kitchen tables.
   ``His works are characterized by an exceptional ability to
control the rhythmical spacing of shapes and the division of
picture areas,'' commented The Times of London.
   ``His often very beautiful colors ranged from the richly
voluptuous to a fondness for pure black and white: a blend of
sensuality and austerity which is characteristic of his work.''
   Few British painters have been more widely represented in the
world's galleries. Scott's work is included in permanent
collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Goteborg
Museum in Sweden, the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome and
the Tate Museum in London.
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Lucas, and two sons, James and
Robert.

<HEAD>Holidays Helped Girl Who Was Switched With Another At Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excitement about the holidays has helped
11-year-old Kimberly Mays cope with the news that she and another
girl apparently were switched at birth, the man who raised her said.
   ``I don't think Kim's been terribly bothered with the thoughts
of anything over the past few weeks,'' Robert Mays said.
   ``She's been very excited about Christmas,'' told the Sarasota
Herald-Tribune in a story published Sunday. ``Kids don't let a lot
get between them and Santa Claus.''
   It was Mays' first interview since he faced a roomful of
reporters five weeks ago to discuss his reaction to genetic tests
that revealed Kimberly is not his biological daughter.
   Under an agreement reached between Mays and Ernest and Regina
Twigg of Sebring, Kimberly's biological parents, the fifth-grader
is allowed to remain with Mays. Mays had refused to allow the
genetic tests of his only child for more than a year until the
Twiggs agreed to drop any custody claim of Kimberly if tests
revealed she was their daughter.
   Robert and Barbara Mays' biological daughter, Arlena, who was
raised by the Twiggs, died in 1988 at the age of 9 of a congenital
heart defect. Barbara Mays died of cancer in 1981.
   ``There's been virtually no discussion, none whatsoever, about
the Twiggs with me since the day after the blood tests came back,''
he said.
   Mays said he has tried to impress on Kimberly that she can take
as much time as she needs to sort out her feelings.
   ``I think, considering everything she's been through, she's
doing remarkably well for an 11-year-old child,'' said Mays, who
has shielded Kimberly from reporters throughout the ordeal.
   Mays said he's been too busy as a roofing supply salesman and
preparing for the holidays to make any decision about whether to
sue Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula, where Kimberly and Arlena
were born and the switch apparently took place.
   The Twiggs initially filed a $100 million lawsuit against the
hospital, but have withdrawn that lawsuit and filed another one
seeking unspecified damages.
   Hospital officials, who denied any wrongdoing, have been mum
ever since the test results were disclosed.
   Mays also said there has not been enough time to schedule
psychological tests of Kimberly to determine whether she would
suffer from meeting the Twiggs and their children.
   The Twiggs say they would like to get to know Kimberly and
introduce her to her brothers and sisters, who range in age from 21
to 6, but not if psychologists hired by both families agree that it
would be traumatic for the young girl.
   The Twiggs also have agreed not to establish contact with her,
and will refrain from sending birthday cards or Christmas presents
until the psychological evaluations are complete.

   Well-armed New Year's Eve revelers rang in
1990 with the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire in Southern California
today, despite police warnings that the tradition shooting into the
air is dangerous as well as illegal.
   Shots could be heard from all compass points downtown after the
stroke of midnight.
   ``We're used to it. It sounds like a shooting gallery,'' said
police Sgt. T. Brown. ``The dopes won't learn unless they get hit
themselves. Death toll figures tomorrow will tell the story.''
   There weren't any immediate reports of people being hit by stray
slugs.
   Weeklong warnings by police agencies that shooting into the air
is a felony _ and a potentially deadly way to celebrate the new
year _ failed to halt the practice.
   Aerial gunfire has killed dozens of people in recent years, with
most hit in the head by slugs falling far from where the bullets
were fired.
   Weapons experts say bullets return to earth at the same speed
they were traveling when the left the muzzle of the gun, making
them equally lethal on the way down.
   While police tried to pinpoint midnight firing sites, some
residents cowered at home in fear of the rain of lead.
   Michael Piper said he and his wife, Sandy, felt safer in their
middle-floor apartment in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los
Angeles than at a gathering in a one-story house.
   ``We left the party early to greet the new year alone,'' he
said. ``I wouldn't want to be outside without a bulletproof vest
and an army helmet.'' City police routinely ground their squadron
of patrol helicopters during the height of the shooting.
   Law officers in Southern California spent the final days of 1989
warning against the misuse of guns and abuse of alcohol to
celebrate the New Year, but said they expected the worst.
   ``It's a major concern of ours every year,'' said Costa Mesa
police Lt. Alan Kent. ``And we haven't noticed it getting any
better.''
   In Los Angeles, both police Chief Daryl Gates and Sheriff
Sherman Block held news conferences warning that it's a felony to
fire a gun into the air in a residential area.
   The Los Angeles Police Department set up at least eight command
posts to make arrests.
   In Santa Ana, an Orange County city where the gunfire is common,
officers have posted thousands of safety leaflets in English and
Spanish warning against the practice.

   Searchers found the wreckage of a
single-engine airplane in a remote, wooded ravine three days after
it was reported missing, authorities said. All three people aboard
were killed.
   Searchers in aircraft were unable to find the white Beechcraft
plane because of dense tree cover, but a ground team located it
Sunday about 15 miles northwest of Merrill in northern Wisconsin,
Lincoln County Sheriff Ronald Krueger said.
   One victim was found in the wreckage and the other two had been
thrown clear, Krueger said.
   The victims were the 42-year-old pilot, his 14-year-old son and
his 17-year-old nephew, all of Illinois, the sheriff said. Their
bodies were badly burned and there were no signs any of them
survived the initial impact, he said.
   Kruger said a fallen tree had damaged the plane's emergency
locator signal, complicating the search.

   Bomb threats against a Northwest Airlines
Paris-to-Detroit flight didn't rattle the 22 passengers who kept
their reservations.
   ``I wasn't worried a bit, especially after all the security we
went through to get on the flight,'' Mike Matour, 22, of
Philadelphia said after Flight 51 landed without incident at 4:41
p.m. Saturday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen, who took the flight, said 105
of 127 passengers canceled their reservations after learning a
telephone caller said Flight 51 would be targeted. Whalen said the
flight had nine crew members.
   Airline officials in Paris said earlier that the plane carried
28 passengers and 14 crew members. The jet can hold 284 passengers.
   Northwest disclosed the threat after reports of it emerged in
Europe.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and airlines have come under
pressure to disclose such threats since the December 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people. A
threat against Pan Am before that flight was circulated within the
U.S. government, but not to the public.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said U.S. airlines receive about 300
threats each year.

   The weather front that pelted the Northeast with rain and sleet
Sunday was moving out to sea, leaving behind colder temperatures
and a chance of snow. Flurries were forecast today for western New
York state, Pennsylvania and New Jersey as well as in the Great
Lakes region.
   Clear skies were expected over the nation's midsection, with
snow in the Rockies and rain in parts of California and the Pacific
Northwest. Snow was expected in the Cascade range of Washington and
Oregon.
   In Pasadena, clouds drifted over the thousands who spent the
night waiting on the streets for Tournament of Roses parade to
begin. There was a 30 percent chance afternoon showers could fall
on the Rose Bowl game between the University of Michigan and the
University of Southern California. Highs were forecast to be in the
low to mid-60s.
   A mass of cold air bulging south from Canada was expected to
plunge temperatures to highs in the 20s in the upper Midwest and
the 30s in inland New England and the Rockies. Above-freezing
weather was forecast in most of the rest of the country, with highs
in the 60s and 70s in the southeast and the desert Southwest.
   Miami Beach, which shivered through an unusual cold wave just a
week ago, was expected to warm to the 80s again after setting a
record high for the date of 82 degrees Sunday.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he's just had
the toughest year of his tenure _ one of strikes, ethnic violence
and economic strain _ but thinks the 1990s could be extraordinarily
peaceful and harmonious.
   Speaking in his annual New Year's television address to the
Soviet people, Gorbachev also made it clear that he disagrees with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's year-end conclusion that
socialism has failed.
   ``The necessity to combine socialism with democracy has again
been vigorously reaffirmed in the dramatic events that occurred in
Berlin, Sofia, Prague and Bucharest,'' Gorbachev said in the speech
just before midnight Sunday.
   Communists in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Poland
were forced by pro-democracy movements to give up their absolute
power in 1989, and Communists in Bulgaria are trying to stem public
protests with reforms.
   Gorbachev wished Eastern Europeans success in their
revolutionary renewal and promised Soviet solidarity.
   ``The postwar division of the continent recedes into the past,''
he said. The Cold War is ending, and people now speak of his idea
of a ``common European home'' as a realistic prospect instead of
fantasy, he said.
   ``The 1990s could become the most fruitful period in the history
of civilization,'' he predicted, if people concentrate on
``solidarity, cooperation and accord.''
   He was clearly appealing for unity not only internationally but
domestically.
   In 1989, the Soviet Union was riven by calls for secession and
by ethnic strife that killed hundreds of people. His New Year's
wish was that 1990 pass ``under the watchword of mutual
understanding and consolidation.''
   The past year has been the most difficult of his tenure, said
Gorbachev, who came to power in March 1985. ``But no matter how
difficult 1989 was, we are seeing it off not only with a sense of
bitterness, but also as a year in which much indispensable work was
accomplished.''
   The year brought the Soviet Union's first ``genuinely free
elections,'' its first Congress, parliamentary experience and ``a
rapid rise in the democratic culture of the people,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Last spring's elections to the Congress of People's Deputies
were the first contested elections in Soviet history, and the
balloting produced true competition in many districts. However, in
some areas, Communist bureaucrats kept an iron grip on the
electoral process.
   Gorbachev said better times lie ahead.
   ``It is not easy for seeds to grow in our soil,'' he said,
apparently referring obliquely to democracy.
   ``But if they survive and strike root _ and we must see they do
_ they will yield rich fruit for the entire country and every
person.''
   The Soviet leader recorded a separate New Year's message for the
American people that was to be broadcast on U.S. television today.
   In his message to the Soviet people, President Bush pledged to
work with Gorbachev to ``reduce barriers to trade, investment and
the free movement of goods and ideas'' so the Soviet Union's
``entry into the global market can be advanced.''

   A south wind frustrated efforts to clean a spill
of about 2,000 gallons of marine diesel oil in Elliott Bay.
   The source of the spill, spotted Friday night, was not known,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Cobb.
   Crews collected about 500 gallons of oil by mid-Sunday, but wind
kept the remainder under a pier. Officials said the oil could be
cleaned up when the winds abate.
   The spill blackened the shoreline, but no seabirds or mammals
appeared affected.
   Because the origin of the spill was unknown, the estimated
$60,000 to $75,000 cost of the cleanup will be paid by a federal
fund.

<TEXT>
   With the government shaken by the firing of a
Cabinet minister for alleged contacts with the PLO, rival political
leaders negotiated with small parties today to try to form a new
governing coalition.
   In the occupied lands, the army confined at least 1.1 million
Palestinians to their homes in an attempt to prevent violent
outbreaks. Today is the 25th anniversary of the founding of PLO
Chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement.
   Curfew orders banning people from going out were in effect for
the entire Gaza Strip and four of the largest cities in the West
Bank.
   The Cabinet crisis was triggered by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc, who on Sunday handed a letter
of dismissal to Science Minister Ezer Weizman of the center-left
Labor Party.
   Shamir accused the 65-year-old former defense minister and
fighter pilot of meeting PLO officials and exchanging messages with
Arafat in violation of government policy.
   Weizman has not directly commented on the accusations, but he
said in repeated radio and television interviews that other Israeli
officials were also involved in at least indirect contacts with the
PLO.
   Labor, headed by Vice Premier Shimon Peres, responded to
Shamir's move by threatening to leave the government unless the
prime minister rescinds the letter, which formally goes into effect
Tuesday.
   Both Shamir and Peres held meetings today with leaders of four
religious parties, each aiming to persuade the small parties to
join a new coalition to replace the current Likud-Labor government.
   The religious parties have 12 seats in the 120-member
Parliament, giving them significant clout in deciding whether the
39-seat Labor or 40-seat Likud could rule separately, along with
right- or left-wing allies.
   Some Labor and Likud leaders sought a compromise that would
leave Shamir's year-old government intact, an aide to Shamir said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said on Israel radio
that he saw ``the continuation of the national unity government as
the need of the hour.''
   Rabin added that the dispute over whether Israel should speak to
the PLO ``is not a subject worth breaking up the government.''
   Environmental Affairs Minister Roni Milo of Likud also said ``I
believe the prime minister is interested in seeing the government
last.''
   One compromise idea under discussion was to leave Weizman in the
Cabinet as a minister-without-portfolio, while removing him from
the 12-member, decision-making Inner Cabinet, Israeli media
reported.
   If no agreement is reached, the 26-member government could fall
in a parliamentary vote of no confidence scheduled for later in the
week at the urging of left-wing parties. Labor was reportedly
considering supporting these motions.
   Shamir declined to be specific about Weizman's alleged meetings
with the PLO, saying only that the minister had passed messages to
Arafat and met other PLO officials.
   Israeli media said the source of Shamir's information was the
Shin Bet, Israel's secret security agency.
   Shamir claimed in a nationwide television broadcast Sunday that
these actions undermined his attempts to get Middle East peace
talks underway without PLO involvement.
   Israeli media indicated Shamir was angered by alleged contacts
with PLO figures via an Israeli Arab physician, Ahmed Tibi, who has
reportedly visited Tunis.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Weizman had also been trying to
arrange a meeting with Arafat.
   Other reports said Weizman had met Nabil Shaath of Arafat's
Fatah faction and Geneva PLO representative Nabil Amlawi.
   Rabin confirmed on the radio that Weizman had conveyed some
messages at least indirectly to the PLO to persuade the
organization to accept peace proposals of U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   Baker has called for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks as a step
toward bringing about elections proposed by Israel in the occupied
territories.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cacophony of drums, saxophones and
firecrackers pierced the air early today and fireworks illuminated
the Berlin Wall as tens of thousands of people from East and West
celebrated New Year's together.
   Tens of thousands poured in both directions through the newly
opened Brandenburg Gate each hour, and thousands more scaled the
wall and tumbled into the other Germany as border guards watched
with amusement.
   In a revival of the city-wide street party that erupted when the
Berlin Wall opened Nov. 9, young people scrambled atop the divide
to take in the scene on both sides, bobbing and rocking to the
erratic rhythm of the concert without conductor at Brandenburg Gate.
   Hammers clanged against chisels as hundreds mined the wall for
souvenirs.
   After midnight, some scaffolding supporting an outdoor
projection screen near Brandenburg Gate collapsed under the weight
of revelers, killing a man and injuring 135 people, East Germany's
official ADN news agency reported. Seventy-seven of them were
hospitalized, it said.
   ADN said drunks and a carpet of broken glass from champagne
bottles hindered rescue workers.
   In other border areas, police police arrested 68 neo-Nazi
activists overnight after they tried to stage illegal
demonstrations. Authorities in both German states had formed joint
patrols to prevent disturbances threatened by right-wing radicals.
   A West Berlin counter-culture group had appealed to Berliners on
both sides of the crumbling divide to bring musical instruments and
inspiration to the battle-scarred gate, for a concert to fete the
first New Year's in four decades that Germans have celebrated
together.
   ``We just wanted to be here for it. It's fantastic,'' said
21-year-old Kerry Bundgaard of Phoenix as her father videotaped the
scene.
   ``The wall is open for the first time in my life. We want to
celebrate along with everyone else,'' said Hans-Juergen Witfeld,
who traveled from the Ruhr Valley city of Dortmund with eight
friends to spend the holiday in cold and misty Berlin.
   At midnight, fireworks filled the midnight sky over Brandenburg
Gate. The soot-stained monument was swathed in smoke as young
people from around the world clamored atop the surrounding wall and
scaled even the tarnished bronze chariot that crowns the columned
gate.
   Since East German authorities began punching holes in the
graffiti-splattered concrete that had severed Berlin since 1961,
the wall has become more a bridge than a barrier.
   Tour buses from throughout Europe shuttled thousands to the
heart of the party, a stretch of pock-marked wall between the
Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin and a towering Christmas tree on
the west side.
   Tourists filled every hotel and restaurant to capacity on both
sides of the wall and jammed streets and parking lots with
impromptu parties.
   Enterprising youth like 15-year-old Salim Mussa hawked chips of
the wall for up to $30, West Berliners rented out hammers and
chisels, and the West German government operated a mobile
information booth for any East German visitors considering
relocation in the West.
   Border police said they had no estimate of the numbers crossing
between the two Germanys.

<HEAD>Eight Matisse Paintings Stolen From Family Apartment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cat burglar stole eight works by French
master Henri Matisse worth $12.5 million from the family home on
the Riviera, police said Monday.
   The works include the celebrated oil paintings ``View Over
Collioure Port,'' ``Woman in Brittany'' and ``Devilacqua,''
investigators with the Nice police said.
   Two other oil paintings, a linoleum engraving and two pencil
sketches were also stolen. Police did not immediately reveal the
titles of these works or estimate a value of the individual pieces.
   One of the century's most praised artists, Matisse lived in the
plush apartment located in the hills overlooking the Mediterranean
for many years before his death in 1954.
   The apartment has been unoccupied for most of the past 20 years.
The painter's daughter-in-law, Maria Matisse, discovered the theft
Friday on her first visit to the residence since November.
   The burglar apparently climbed a rain gutter to a third-story
window, unlatched the wooden shutters and cut through the glass to
make his entry. The window was not protected by a burglar alarm.
   Police said the theft resembled a recent wave of cat burglaries
in the upper middle-class neighborhood.
   The collection of works kept at the apartment are well-known and
police said it would be difficult for the thieves to sell them on
the legitimate art market.

   The 28 crew members of a 600-foot Greek
freighter that sank in the Pacific Ocean should arrive Wednesday
aboard a Coast Guard cutter, authorities said.
   The Vulca went down Sunday morning, 800 miles northeast of
Hawaii after efforts to pump water from its two forward holds
failed, the Coast Guard said.
   The ship was carrying scrap metal from Los Angeles to South
Korea when it began taking water Thursday.
   The Philippine crew members and Greek officers fled unharmed to
the cutter Sassafras on Saturday evening.
   The cause of the original flooding was not determined, and there
was no estimate on the value of the ship and its cargo, officials
said.

<TEXT>
   Romanians today celebrated their first
New Year's in more than two decades free of Nicolae Ceausescu's
despotism, and their revolutionary leaders issued decrees that
began to dismantle Communist rule.
   Romanian Radio reported no overnight clashes between the army
and die-hard Securitate units, suggesting a slow return to
normality after two weeks of unrest believed to have claimed
thousands of lives.
   ``The Communist Party is dead,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Corneliu Bogdan told reporters Sunday, two weeks after security
forces fired on anti-government protesters to touch off the
revolution that toppled Ceausescu.
   Bogdan assured Romanians that there was ``no danger'' of
Communists returning to undisputed power.
   In a New Year's address, interim President Ion Iliescu announced
the abolition of the death penalty and re-introduction of the
concept of private ownership. He formally announced the abolition
of the feared Securitate, the East German news agency ADN reported
from Bucharest.
   Iliescu also signed a decree that provides the legal basis for
the creation of new political parties _ an important step toward
free elections promised for April. The decree says officials of the
defense and interior ministries, judges, prosecutors, members of
state radio and television cannot join political parties, to ensure
their impartiality, the official Agerpress news agency reported.
   At least six new political parties have emerged since
Ceausescu's was overthrown Dec. 22 by a nation outraged over the
massacre by security forces of hundreds of people in the western
city of Timisoara.
   The army had joined the people in toppling Ceausescu after 24
years of autocratic rule. Ceausescu and his wife Elena were
summarily tried and executed Christmas Day, convicted of
``genocide'' and other grave crimes.
   Iliescu is a former Communist Party secretary who fell out of
favor with Ceausescu for speaking his mind but has the political
experience that dissident intellectuals and other former opposition
figures lack.
   Bogdan, his country's U.S. ambassador for more than a decade
before falling into disfavor in the early 1980s, told his news
conference that party members were in the minority in the
provisional government. But he said their expertise is needed to
smooth the transformation to democracy.
   He said those in provisional government did not consider
themselves Communist Party members after the oppressive Ceausescu
era.
   ``I was one of them,'' he said of the Communists. ``I will pay
for it,'' he added, without elaborating.
   It was unclear how many people were in the government, but
divergent reports concurred that there were more than 20. Bogdan
gave neither overall figures nor the proportion of Communists among
the leadership.
   Bogdan also said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
would be visiting later in the week.
   Iliescu made public agricultural production figures according to
which the year's total cereal production amounted to 16.9 million
tons, instead of the claimed 60 million tons. Other totals also
well below claimed amounts.
   He also decreed land on which farmers live and surrounding plots
private property, re-establishing a concept banned for decades.
Iliescu said farmers would again be allowed to sell produce and
animals raised on leased land.
   To pay off the country's foreign debt, Ceausescu had in recent
years exported Romania's best agricultural products while forcing
privation and rationing upon his people. The new government is now
opening warehouses and making those items available to the people.
   Although Iliescu abolished the death penalty, he pledged a
``tough trial'' nonetheless for ``all those guilty of crimes'' _ an
apparent allusion to Ceausescu loyalists.
   The former head of Securitate, Iulian Vlad, was detained for
questioning Sunday along with three ranking members of the ministry
controlling the police, Agerpress reported. It did not specify what
charges, if any, the four face.
   Thousands of Securitate agents surrendered after Vlad ordered
them to last week, but several hundred are believed still at large
and prepared to die fighting.
   Hungarian television, meanwhile, reported that an assailant it
did not identify stabbed Nicu Ceausescu, the son of the late
dictator, immediately after he was shown on Romanian television
Dec. 22.
   The assailant was arrested, while the younger Ceausescu
underwent an operation for his stomach wound ``which was
successful,'' Hungarian TV said. Nicu Ceausescu had been a regional
Communist chief.
   On New Year's Eve, Adevarul _ the former Communist daily that is
now non-affiliated _ and other newspapers reserved much of their
space for rejoicing, but the anticipation of the celebrations was
tinged with caution.
   One newspaper carried a warning from police, asking holiday
merrymakers not to use fireworks and noisemakers in the capital,
where the streets were still filled with nervous soldiers armed
with automatic weapons.
   Nonetheless, Romanians' mood seemed mostly euphoric.
   Romanians on the street greeted each other and foreigners with
cheerful shouts of ``Multi Ani'' _ the equivalent of Happy New Year
_ as they trudged through the snow and slush.

   Some 200,000 partygoers threw streamers and squawked horns as
the ball dropped in New York's Times Square, while some people in
Los Angeles celebrated with gunfire to mark the start of a new year
and new decade today.
   The nationally televised lighted ball sliding down a pole high
above Times Square, a tradition of most New Year's Eves since 1907,
had a few rivals this year _ a foam-and-fiberglass Georgia peach in
Atlanta, a Texas Lone Star in Houston and an ascending elevator car
on Seattle's Space Needle.
   The countdown Sunday night had an extra ``leap second'' to keep
the world's clocks in time with the rotation of the planet.
   Untimely drizzle rounded off the edges of ice sculptures
decorating Boston as part of its 14th annual First Night
festivities, but an estimated 250,000 people showed up anyway to
watch midnight fireworks over Boston Harbor.
   Some people in Los Angeles celebrated with an illegal and
dangerous fireworks tradition of their own _ shooting guns into the
air. Gunfire was heard throughout the city around midnight.
   ``We're used to it. It sounds like a shooting gallery,'' said
police Sgt. T. Brown. ``The dopes won't learn unless they get hit
themselves. Death toll figures tomorrow will tell the story.''
   There weren't any immediate reports of people being hit by stray
rounds.
   Revelers in New York ignored daylong rain and packed Times
Square, though the crowd was smaller than the 600,000 police had
expected.
   Only 20 arrests were made this year, more than 50 fewer than
last year. This year, eight were charged with robbery, two with
attempted robbery, five with assault and five with disorderly
conduct, said a police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   ``It was a very slow night. I think the rain contributed a
little bit to us, to help us,'' he said.
   A baby girl born at 20 seconds past midnight was thought to be
the first New Yorker born this decade. The Brooklyn child was born
to Luzanne Small, 23, and Laxley Chin, 22, said spokesman Tom Dugan
at Long Island Cottage Hospital.
   And in a judge's apartment the city's first black mayor was
sworn in a few minutes after midnight.
   David Dinkins took his oath as New York's 106th mayor from his
former law partner, state Court of Appeals Judge Fritz W. Alexander
2nd. Public ceremonies were planned later today.
   Dinkins, 62, succeeds Edward I. Koch, the outspoken three-term
mayor who was defeated in the Democratic primary in September.
   Meanwile, the revelers at Times Square chanted in unison to
count down the last seconds of the 1980s as they watched the ball
drop.
   ``I want to party all night! All decade!'' said Robyn Rzepecki,
19, of Scituate, R.I.
   The celebrations continued today.
   Crowds gathered overnight in Pasadena, Calif., along the 5{-mile
route of the 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, taking pizza
deliveries and whooping it up on the sidewalk in anticipation of
today's celebration.
   ``It's a real circus,'' said Ferris Reid of Aurora, Ill. ``But I
don't think I'm crazy being here all night. Being crazy was staying
back in Illinois in the winter.''
   In Philadelphia this morning, the annual New Year's Day Mummers
Parade was postponed until Jan. 6 because of gusting winds and
possible snow.
   Because New Year's Eve fell on a Sunday, some nightspots around
the country couldn't serve drinks.
   Other celebrants didn't want them. In Decatur, Ill., about 300
revelers at an Alcoholics Anonymous party drank coffee and soft
drinks.
   ``We've got a bunch of people here that know how to drink. They
just don't do it anymore,'' said one man. ``It's probably the only
place in the city tonight without alcohol where people are dancing
and having a really good time.''
   At 90 seconds before midnight, thousands watched the outside
elevator cars on Seattle's Space Needle ascend, reaching the top at
midnight in a blaze of 6,500 lights.
   In Houston, a 20-foot Lone Star was rigged to rise up the side
of the Texas Commerce Tower and arrived at the top at midnight to
the accompaniment of a fireworks display choreographed to music.
Police estimated about 30,000 people watched from Houston's Market
Square.
   Folks in Atlanta built a 6-foot-wide foam and fiberglass Georgia
peach and dropped it from a light tower at midnight at the
Underground Atlanta mall. Police estimated at least 80,000 revelers
jammed into the mall.
   In New York's Times Square, a small army of sanitation workers
early today attacked the litter from the last hours of the 80s.
   ``An average of 25 tons of party hats, confetti, empty bottles,
lost shoes, and forgotten New Year's resolutions have been swept up
each year,'' said Vito Turso, spokesman for the Sanitation
Department.
   In Miami, ``Feel good! Let it go! Lose control!'' was the
message Chubby Checker spread Sunday night as tens of thousands of
people cheered, oohed and danced to the 56th annual King Orange
Jamboree Parade.
   Nevada resorts had an all-star lineup including comics Jay Leno
and George Carlin and crowd-pleasing singers such as Wayne Newton
and Dolly Parton. Tony Bennett left his heart and long-running
singing engagement at the Venetian Room of the Fairmont Hotel in
San Francisco for a one-night show Sunday in Las Vegas at the
Riviera hotel-casino.
   He apparently won't have the Venetian Room to go back to. The
Four Freshmen performed for a crowd of 500 at what was billed by
the hotel owners as the famous club's farewell performance.
   ``They're whooping it up, but there was definitely a melancholy
note,'' said bellman Scott Cameron.

<HEAD>Study to Track Response of Veterans Who Return to Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The words of a South Vietnamese soldier
hold new meaning for David Pye as he prepares to return to the
country that still feeds his nightmares.
   The young man, who served on a night patrol with Pye, told him
more than two decades ago: ``I would like to be able to lay my head
down at night and not hear small arms fire.''
   Pye, who runs a veteran's outreach center in this seaside town
north of Boston, is one of 12 veterans returning to Vietnam this
month to see if a peacetime visit will help silence the sounds of
combat that echo in their dreams and memories.
   The 16-day excursion, sponsored by a University of Massachusetts
center devoted to the examination of war and its aftermath, is part
of a study on post-traumatic stress disorder _ the flashbacks,
nightmares and depression that afflict many veterans who fought in
Vietnam. A second group of veterans, who also will participate in
the study, is scheduled to make a trip in May.
   All the veterans participating in the trip are counselors.
   ``There have been some ad hoc studies done, but they are not
conclusive,'' said Kevin Bowen, the Joiner Center's executive
director and Vietnam veteran. ``There has been a lot of anecdotal
evidence that going back to Vietnam has a real healing effect on
vets.''
   Researchers will conduct interviews and tests on the
participants before they go to Vietnam, immediately after they
return, and six months and a year after the trip.
   By studying the responses over time, the researchers will try to
determine whether visiting Vietnam reduced the level of post
traumatic stress.
   Since learning he would be returning to Vietnam, Pye said he has
had several nightmares _ dreams he hasn't had for 18 years. ``The
closer we get to the date, the higher my anxiety is,'' he said.
   Pye, 43, first came to Vietnam on a troop ship on New Year's Eve
in 1966. He remembers watching the ``fireworks'' for a few days
before landing. ``I was, of course, scared,'' he said.
   Gumersindo Gomez, another veteran who will be traveling with the
group, said his dreams often take him to a jungle river, where he
wades knee-deep in water while the enemy shoots from the sides.
   ``Every night I've been having nightmares,'' Gomez said. ``These
are combat-related nightmares _ the fear of being killed.''
   Neither Gomez nor Pye has returned to Vietnam before, and
despite the anxiety both feel at the upcoming journey, the two men
hope the experience will help them exorcise old ghosts.
   Bowen remembers the anxiety of waiting to return to Vietnam for
the first time. He was drafted into the Army after dropping out of
college, and served from 1968-69.
   Bowen has been back four times. He first went in 1987 with a
group of college professors, and since then on various projects
sponsored by the Joiner Foundation.
   In many ways, the most profound observations were also the
simplest. The country was silent. And the land was beautiful.
``There was nothing in the sky,'' Bowen said.
   Now, Bowen has established a new relationship with Vietnam and
its people.
   ``I got to places where I lost friends and that was very
powerful,'' he said. ``Going to the memorial in Washington was one
thing. To be able to say goodbye _ to be able to do that there _ is
just as important.''

<HEAD>1989 A Record Year For Manatee Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record number of manatees, 160,
died in Florida waters in 1989, and state biologists fear recent
cold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals.
   ``We're quite worried about the increasing number of deaths,''
said Bruce Ackerman, a researcher with the Department of Natural
Resources in St. Petersburg.
   Biologists estimate at least 1,200 manatees, an endangered
species, live in Florida. The population had been estimated at as
many as 10,000 a few decades ago.
   In 1989, 51 manatees died after hitting boats or barges, and
five were killed by other human-caused problems, such as
entanglement in fishing nets, according to the Department of
Natural Resources.
   In 1988, 133 manatees were found dead in Florida. Boats killed
43 manatees, then a record.
   Environmentalists and government biologists cite these
statistics when they promote boating speed limits and increased
protection of manatee habitat, issues state lawmakers could debate
this spring.
   Manatees frequent rivers, estuaries, canals and protected
coastal areas that also are magnets for the state's more than
710,000 registered motor boats.
   The average adult manatee is about 10 feet long and weighs 1,000
pounds, though some weigh three times that much. Gray and
slow-moving, they can be difficult for speedy boaters to spot, said
Lori Price, captive marine mammal specialist for the Department of
Natural Resources.
   ``I think very few of them (boaters) actually maliciously intend
to run down a manatee,'' she said. ``They're very difficult to
see.''

<TEXT>
   Seven months after Deng Xiaoping told Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that their decades-old ideological schism was healed,
Chinese leaders are privately accusing Gorbachev's reforms of
leading the socialist world astray.
   Chinese authorities, in internal documents and closed meetings,
reportedly blame Gorbachev and his ``new thinking'' diplomacy for
unleashing the forces that have ended 40 years of Communist
dominance in East Europe.
   Diplomatic sources say China was being careful to avoid a public
break with the Soviet Union and other fast-changing socialist
states by stressing that China never interferes in the internal
affairs of other nations.
   The sources say open disapproval of the upheavals in East Europe
would show the Chinese people how isolated their hard-line leaders
have become from the popular reforms sweeping the socialist world.
   The authorities have taken a different tack, drumming home in
recent days the inevitability of Communist rule in China and the
correctness of their harsh suppression of political opposition.
   Privately, however, Deng and other leaders feel betrayed by the
revolutionary events set off by Gorbachev, and are deeply concerned
that democratic unrest may spread to China, the sources say.
   This concern was heightened by the violent overthrow of the
Nicolae Ceausescu government in Romania. Ceausescu, an old friend
of China, tried and failed to use the Chinese method of silencing
dissent with armed force.
   Following Ceausescu's downfall, several illegal anti-government
posters have appeared on Beijing campuses, among the first small
signs of resistance since the military crackdown of the student-led
movement in June.
   One internal document circulating among high officials that lays
down official position on Romania reportedly cites Gorbachev's
policies as one factor behind the turmoil in Romania. It also
speaks of the subversion of hostile foreign forces, a reference to
the West.
   Senior party leaders have also criticized Gorbachev in meetings
convened over the past few weeks to discuss East Europe, sources
say.
   In May, Gorbachev traveled to Beijing for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. He said the normalization of
bilateral relations, confirmed in his meeting with Deng, was of
``epoch-making significance.''
   It has produced more Chinese-Soviet trade and increased the pace
of talks on the future of the disputed Sino-Soviet border. Premier
Li Peng is still expected to return Gorbachev's visit next spring.
   But the democratic reforms in Eastern Europe have revived old
suspicions and ruled out the possibility for ideological
brotherhood.
   A visit to China last week by Valentin Falin, head of the Soviet
Communist Party's International Department and the highest party
official in China since May, went unnoticed in the official Chinese
press until he met on his final day with party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin.
   Reports on that meeting had Jiang lecturing Falin that socialist
reform must ``take the right route.'' The Soviet side had no
comment on the talks, and Falin declined even to talk to the Soviet
press.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua, asked about Gorbachev's
``new thinking'' diplomacy that encourages socialist countries to
choose their own paths to political reform, said the concept
``requires careful and serious study.''
   But a Soviet source said it was ``very clear the Chinese are now
critical'' of the idea. Sources say senior Chinese leaders are
criticizing Gorbachev for ``confusing people'' about socialism.
   Analysts point out that the situation now is far different from
the 1960s, when Mao Tse-tung accused Moscow of revisionism and the
two countries split over ideological differences and leadership of
the Communist world.
   China's doctrinaire hard-liners still believe, as Jiang said in
a recent speech, that China ``should occupy the ideological front
with Marxism.''
   But with the Communist world in disarray, vying with the Soviet
Union for ideological leadership is no longer a real prospect.
   Instead, China's leaders are trying to survive by staying above
the fray. The future of socialism is bright, the Chinese are being
told to believe, but only if China goes its own way.

<HEAD>Task Force Cut To Four Detectives, Three Aides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Green River Task Force, which once had 56
officers and support workers assigned to track the deaths and
disappearances of dozens of women, is being cut this week to seven
people, The Seattle Times reported Monday.
   The investigation into the deaths and disappearances of 49 women
from 1982 through March 1984 once included several law enforcement
jurisdictions but now will be limited to King County officers. The
case is among the largest unsolved serial murder cases in the
United States.
   ``We plan to keep the four detectives in the case through 1990.
It is still a major commitment, but there is only a workload for so
many,'' Sheriff James Montgomery said.
   The remains of 41 women have been found. Victims have been from
the Seattle and Portland, Ore., areas and most had ties with
prostitution. No one has been charged in the case.
   The task force reached its peak in personnel in 1986, but it has
steadily been whittled down as suspects were eliminated and the
trail became colder.
   The four remaining detectives will continue to gather
information on 40 possible suspects who have yet to be cleared and
process tips that continue to trickle in. They will be assisted by
two clerks and a computer analyst.
   Montgomery said he would quickly add personnel if there were new
leads.
   The county has spent about $16 million on the case. Other
jurisdictions that have contributed personnel to the task force
include the Seattle police, the FBI, the Washington State Patrol
and the Port of Seattle.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Rivalry Breaks Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rivalry broke open Monday between
the two most powerful Afghan rebel groups after one party convicted
and hanged four members of the other for a massacre of guerrilla
commanders.
   The schism places another obstacle in the insurgents' struggle
to topple the Soviet-backed Kabul government and replace it with an
Islamic administration.
   The guerrillas also said Monday that three weeks of savage
fighting with Afghan government forces have destroyed much of the
Afghan garrision town of Khost.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami
guerrilla group, demanded that Burhanuddin Rabbani of the more
moderate Jamiat-i-Islami stand trial for the hangings Dec. 21.
   ``They took a dastardly action. We didn't imagine Jamiat would
resort to such a heinous act,'' Hekmatyar told a news conference in
Islamabad.
   He called for the appointment of an independent tribunal to put
Jamiat leaders on trial for the hangings, which he said were the
product of a ``mock trial.''
   Hekmatyar said he was ordering his own men to stay calm.
   ``I want to call on all Hezb-i-Islami commanders not to knuckle
under to their emotions,'' Hekmatyar said.
   However, he warned Jamiat guerrillas not to cross Hezb territory
in Afghanistan until the dispute is settled.
   A Jamiat spokesman said its northern commander, Ahmad Shah
Masoud, ordered the execution of Syed Jamal and three other men of
the Hezb party in Taloqan, capital of northern Takhar province.
   ``According to the report, Jamal confessed his crimes against
the mujahedeen and the people,'' said the spokesman, who identified
himself only as Omar. The guerrillas are known as mujahedeen, or
Islamic holy warriors.
   Hekmatyar has acknowledged that Jamal and some other Hezb men
captured about 30 Jamiat commanders and murdered some of July 9 in
the same province. He says nine were killed but Jamiat claims it
was all 30.
   Masoud later captured Jamal and dozens of other Hezb members.
   Unconfirmed reports indicate that hundreds may have died in
subsequent clashes between the two groups in various parts of
northern Afghanistan.
   Both parties are based in Pakistan, which funnels U.S.-supplied
arms to them and five other guerrilla factions.
   They have been fighting for 11 years to topple Kabul's ruling
Marxists, who themselves are split into two rival factions. Soviet
troops intervened between December 1979 and February 1989 but
Moscow continues to arm Afghanistan's military.
   Despite predictions of their early defeat after the Soviet
pullout, the Afghan Communists still hold the country's major
cities. The guerrillas control about 90 percent of the countryside.
   The clashes in northeastern Afghanistan are mainly a turf war in
the homeland of the Tajik tribe, which dominates Jamiat.
   The ethnic Pathans of Hezb-i-Islami are a minority in the
northeast, but form an overall majority among the country's 15
million people.
   More than 5 million have fled the war to refugee camps in
Pakistan and Iran.
   Thirty guerrillas were killed and 80 injured in the fighting
near Khost, 15 miles west of the Pakistan border, said Fazal Akbar,
head of pro-guerrilla Afghan Information and Documentation Center.
   Akbar quoted a guerrilla commander as saying 150 government
soliders were killed or wounded.
   ``Most parts of the city of Khost have been destroyed,'' said
Akbar, quoting Mali Khan, commander of Harkat-e-Inqilab-e-Islami
rebel group.
   Mali Khan also claimed that the guerrillas shot down an Afghan
military aircraft Dec. 25, but he gave no further details of the
plane or its occupants.
   There was no comment by the Afghan government to the report,
which could not be independently verified.

<HEAD>New Telephone Feature Stirring Concerns over Privacy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An ``electronic peephole'' that displays the
telephone number of incoming calls is worrying defenders of privacy
rights and stirring concern on Capitol Hill.
   But others say the new gadget will short-circuit nuisance calls
and will be a boon to law enforcement.
   The new service is known as Automatic Number Identification, or
Caller ID, and is being offered for about $6.50 a month plus
another $60 to $80 for a small viewing device that flashes an
incoming number before the phone is answered.
   Businesses love it. But privacy advocates say it's Big Brother
and will lead to ``phone prefix discrimination'' and other social
ills as people selectively decide what calls to answer or to ignore.
   ``This changes the nature of phone service. It suddenly is
interactive,'' says Gary Marx, a professor of sociology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``The phone companies are trying to create the argument that
your phone number is something you have no rights over,'' Marx
says. ``This service essentially says ... you don't control your
phone number, we do.''
   Opponents of Caller ID also say it is a device of telephone
merchandizing companies to mine for gold: the names, telephone
numbers and buying habits of people who make phone orders or
inquiries.
   Mark Plotkin, a Washington political fund-raiser and liberal
commentator, says using phones to gather information on people has
``frightening Orwellian implications for the future.''
   ``First it's the phone number and then it's all sorts of
information on the screen ... what color he is, what political
party he belongs to, his religious background,'' Plotkin says.
   Caller ID is drawing the attention of Congress. It will be one
of several privacy issues to be discussed in House and Senate
Judiciary subcommittee hearings this spring, congressional sources
say.
   ``We will urge Congress to adopt legislation to require blocking
devices,'' says Janlori Goldman, a staff attorney with the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Heated debate has surrounded proposals to introduce Caller ID in
several jurisdictions nationwide. California already has passed a
law banning the service unless customers are given the ability to
block it on their phones.
   Caller ID will begin Jan. 9 in Pennsylvania, despite strenuous
opposition. But state phone regulators said Bell of Pennsylvania
must allow police and domestic violence intervention agencies to
block the service at will.
   New York state regulators refused to allow Rochester Telephone
Co. to offer the service unless customers had a total blocking
option.
   Caller ID has been available on a limited basis in New Jersey
since October 1988. It was introduced in Maryland and Virginia in
the past two months, and phone users in Charleston, W.Va., are
ordering it now, according to Bell Atlantic spokesman Ken Pitt.
   South Central Bell, a division of BellSouth, began offering the
service in the Memphis area in December, and expects to begin
offering it in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida within
the next six months, said Jim Whitehead, an official with BellSouth
Services.
   Nynex will offer it in Bennington, Vt., before next summer,
Nynex official Joe Gagen said.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. also offers the service to
its 800-number customers to enable businesses to quickly call up
computerized records when customers call.
   New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. Carrigan said that following
the introduction of Caller ID, requests from customers for traps or
call trace records declined 49 percent in Hudson County during a
six-month period.
   Statewide, the number of requests decreased 18 percent ``and we
expect that to increase with the availability of Caller ID,''
Carrigan said.
   Caller ID also is being used by police to trace bomb threats and
false alarms.
   And it is valued by takeout operations such as pizza parlors to
verify phone orders.
   Retail businesses and banks say Caller ID allows them to have
customers' records available before a company representative picks
up the call _ even though it makes some customers uneasy to be
greeted by name before they identify themselves.
   For the average phone user, phone company officials say Caller
ID simply lets them see who's trying to enter their residences by
telephone.
   ``You have the right to know when you answer the door to know
who's there,'' Pitt says.

<TEXT>
   The new cordiality in Romanian-Soviet
relations following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu may turn
sour over the issue of Moldavian territory annexed by the Soviets
in 1940.
   Moscow accepted a Romanian invitation for Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to visit in January, the official
Soviet news agency Tass said Sunday. But it remains to be seen
whether Moldavia will be on the agenda.
   On the surface, Moscow is only delighted with the revolution
that ousted and executed Ceausescu, who was publicly if politely
chided for his corrupt nepotism by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on a visit two years ago.
   Romania's new president, Ion Iliescu, is an acquaintance of
Gorbachev from days when both worked in Communist youth movements,
East bloc diplomats say.
   The Soviet president underlined the chumminess in a
congratulatory telephone call to Iliescu last week, an item given
prominent publicity in the Romanian newspapers.
   Iliescu, 59, a once prominent communist who fell afoul of
Ceausescu in 1971 and spent the next 18 years in the political
wilderness, is well liked by Soviets in Bucharest, who say he has a
Russian wife.
   ``He speaks good Russian, English and French and is overall a
cultured man,'' a Soviet diplomat smiled approvingly.
   But both the Soviets and Iliescu, who spent time as party leader
in the northern city of Iasi near the border with Soviet Moldavia,
must know that the new friendliness could turn sour if people on
both sides of the border start wanting to unite.
   ``It's a key issue and one that everybody will be watching
closely,'' said a Western diplomat who asked not to be identifed.
``The Soviets must be concerned.''
   East bloc diplomats, asking not to be identifed, act as if there
is no potential problem.
   ``Under the old regime, every day there was an article pushing
their nationalism,'' said one. ``That will change now.''
   Another expressed confidence that the borders drawn in 1940 when
the Soviets used a secret protocol to the Hitler-Stalin pact to
annex part of Moldavia would stay as they are.
   ``It's history,'' he said. ``Yes, we've now admitted that
Romanian and Moldavian are in effect the same language, but I don't
think the borders will shift.''
   Ceausescu himself drew attention to the Moldavian issue when he
said at the congress that unanimously re-elected him president only
a month ago that the Hitler-Stalin pact should be annulled and
``all the consequences'' of it eliminated, possibly suggesting
Moscow should relinquish control of Moldavia. Moldavis is known
under Romanian rule as Bessarabia.
   That remark was typical both of the nationalism fed by
Ceausescu's dreams of a great Romania with himself its undisputed
heroic leader, and of the distance he always kept from Moscow.
   Ceausescu refused to take part in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
of Czechoslovakia, ignored Kremlin bans on trading with the West
and refused to station Warsaw Pact troops on his territory.
   Once Gorbachev's reforms took hold of the Soviet Union,
Ceausescu reduced relations to a bare minimum of trade.
   Intellectuals invited to Moscow would find it close to
impossible to get permission to go. Romanian officials questioned
on Soviet reforms sneered and implied that the Soviets were no
liberals if they had annexed Moldavia.
   It seems the Kremlin's only requirement as its former satellites
break away is a promise to remain in the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   On Friday, Corneliu Bogdan, a fluent Russian, English and French
speaker who is deputy foreign minister, duly gave that assurance,
following the pattern set by Solidarity and civic forum, the
opposition movements that now share power with Communists in Poland
and Czechoslovakia.
   But many Romanians perceive Communism as a system imported from
the Russians who also ``stole'' Moldavia, and their resentment
could boil over into anti-Soviet policies and demands for their old
territory.
   With just a week passed since Ceausescu was ousted, no diplomats
or Romanians can forecast the outcome of the promised free
elections.
   Already, however, conservative parties banned after the
Communist takeover in 1947 are re-emerging. These groups have a
strong strain of nationalism.
   Romania's new leaders might therefore be less amenable to the
Soviets, who face their own problems, with the strength of the
Popular Front movement in Moldavia pushing for more independence
from Moscow, and the decision by the National Congess, last week to
declare the secret protocol of the Hitler-Stalin pact null and void.

   Crowds gathered overnight along the
5{-mile route of the 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, and today
the sun shone on an estimated 1 million curbside spectators.
   Sixty floats, 22 bands and 275 equestrians lined up behind grand
marshal Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the first U.S. astronaut to orbit
the Earth.
   ``This is a beautiful, beautiful planet here that we all
share,'' Glenn said before the parade. ``I'm optimistic we can make
that world of harmony we all want.''
   The Grand Marshal's Trophy for most creative design went to the
General Motors-United Auto Workers entry ``People in Tune with
Technology,'' depicting a futuristic spaceship which rotates upward
and extends into a 60-foot robot.
   The Sweepstakes Trophy for most beautiful float went to Century
21 Real Estate Corp.'s ``The World is Your Backyard,'' depicting a
Victorian home and gazebo shaded by trees with multihued flowers as
stained-glass windows.
   The Rose Parade preceded the 76th Rose Bowl football game
between the University of Southern California and Michigan.
   Officials have in the past several years routinely predicted 1
million visitors for the parade, and did so again this year despite
the difficulty in measuring such a gathering and indications
through grandstand ticket sales that the 1990 crowd might be
thinner.
   But ticket sales have long taken a back seat to television
rights for the parade, and tournament officials said some 350
million viewers were expected as the parade was broadcast to 90
countries.
   Propped along the parade route in beach chairs and sprawled on
blankets, overnight celebrants took pizza deliveries, unpacked
elaborate feasts and fired up barbecues.
   Ferris Reid drove to California from cold Aurora, Ill., and
spent the night at his parade-watching spot.
   ``It's a real circus,'' he said. ``But I don't think I'm crazy
being here all night. Being crazy was staying back in Illinois in
the winter.''
   The National Weather Service had forecast a cloudy day, but a
reddish sun rose and only a few wispy clouds hung over the San
Gabriel Mountain range. It was in the 40s at dawn.
   Police said it was an unusually quiet night.
   More than 1,100 officers patrolled the streets on foot, on
motorcycles, in cars and in helicopters. There were 208 arrests by
dawn, most of those for being drunk, said Janet Hinton, a police
spokeswoman.

   A gun battle between warring
black factions in a township outside Durban killed 10 people and
wounded 15, police said Monday.
   Members of the United Democratic Front, a national
anti-apartheid coalition, started the fighting Sunday night by
setting fire to the house of a member of Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu group, in the township of Wartburg, police said.
   Police said other Inkatha members joined in to help, and in the
ensuing gun battle, nine United Democratic Front members and one
Inkatha member were killed, while 15 members of the front were
wounded. Police said they made no arrests.
   Supporters of the two groups have been feuding for political
power in the Zulu townships of Natal province since 1986, and more
than 2,500 people have been killed. December was the most violent
month yet in the townships around the port city of Durban, the most
populous city in the province.
   Church groups have scheduled a Jan. 5 meeting to discuss how to
end the fighting. Several previous peacemaking attempts have failed.

<HEAD>Aquino Calls For Decade of Peace in Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino called
Monday for a ``decade of peace'' in this troubled land and
announced plans for a national peace conference to bring stability
and social justice to the Philippines.
   The call came during a New Year's Day ceremony at the
presidential palace in which Roman Catholic leaders also urged
stability in a country fighting Communist and Moslem insurgencies
and hit by six coup attempts in less than three years.
   Mrs. Aquino said peace ``cannot come from the Marxist left that
would impose their evil and godless ways on us, nor can it come
from the fascist right, whose lust for wealth and power would bring
us back to the dark days of the tyrant.''
   ``I shall invite the leaders of the private and church sectors
to join the government in convening a national peace conference so
that we can work out, resolve and act to attack the deep sources of
our divisions, our conflicts, our injustices and inequities in
society which are obstacles to peace,'' she said.
   Communist rebels have waged a 21-year insurgency and dissidents
in the military have launched the coup attempts, the most recent on
Dec. 1.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured during
the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt. Key mutiny leaders, including former Lt.
Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, remain at large and have
threatened to continue efforts to oust Mrs. Aquino.
   Mrs. Aquino gave no date for the conference, nor did she say
what groups she will invite. Mrs. Aquino has refused to resume
peace talks with the Communists until they lay down their arms. She
has also ruled out talks with dissident soldiers involved in
previous coup attempts.
   In her speech, she also made no mention of aspirations for
self-rule by the country's 4 million-strong Moslem minority, which
has also been waging a 20-year revolt for independence in the south.
   The Communists, Moslem rebels and Honasan's followers say Mrs.
Aquino's hard-line conditions have made it impossible for them to
join in any dialogue with the government.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Aquino made the most extensive Cabinet change of
her presidency, appointing new leaders for finance, justice and
military affairs.
   Her spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, said the changes were made in
hopes of improving government performance, which has been widely
criticized as ineffectual.
   Elsewhere, Filipinos greeted the New Year with a barrage of
fireworks and shooting of guns that killed eight people and injured
more than 1,700, officials said Monday. Fireworks accidents
triggered five fires in the capital and burned down a garment
factory in a nearby province, officials said.

   Black leaders undeterred by a wave of fatal
bombings and threats turned out today to renew their commitment to
the civil-rights movement, starting with a New Year's Day
commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation.
   ``I do not sense any feeling of fear. The reaction on this has
to be positive, appropriate. It has to be without fear,'' said
Maynard Jackson, who is to be sworn in as Atlanta's mayor on
Tuesday. ``I do sense a determination to work harder for human
rights for all people.''
   An NAACP official had said a strong turnout at today's
``Emancipation Day'' program would show civil-rights activists
aren't intimidated by the mail bombs that killed a federal judge
and a lawyer.
   A city police bomb squad, with a sniffing dog, searched the
Hoosier United Methodist Church about an hour before the program
began. Half an hour later, about 75 people were in the church and
more were streaming in.
   Four police cars were parked in front of and alongside the
church but access to the building was free. NAACP officials had
said earlier that the FBI also would be on hand.
   ``One of the big objectives of terrorist activity is to induce
fear and disrupt regular activities,'' said Earl Shinhoster,
regional director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. ``I hope this would be a time to band together
against fear and show the resolve to continue our work.''
   But Shinhoster, whom the FBI has given close protection since
the bombings, said there would be tight security at the
NAACP-sponsored events marking President Lincoln's signing of the
proclamation that freed slaves in the South. The FBI and local law
officers planned to be at the Atlanta program at Hoosier Memorial
United Methodist Church, one of the higher profile events.
   ``No doubt, we have thought to take extra security precautions,
here and elsewhere in the South as well,'' said Shinhoster, who was
scheduled to speak at a Tuscaloosa, Ala., program today.
   The mail-bomb deaths of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance on Dec.
16 and Savannah, Ga., lawyer and civil-rights leader Robert
Robinson two days later are believed to be linked.
   Two other bombs _ one delivered to a federal courthouse in
Atlanta and one to an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla. _ were
intercepted before they could explode. Robinson worked with the
NAACP.
   A letter to an Atlanta television station from a group claiming
responsibility for the previous bombings said last week that two
more members of the NAACP would be killed.
   The writer expressed anger at crimes by blacks against whites
and at federal court decisions on school integration. The letter
also threatened that any time a black man rapes a white woman in
Alabama, Florida or Georgia, a federal judge, an attorney and an
NAACP official would be assassinated.
   The FBI, which has been working on the case since Vance was
killed, refused to comment on the investigation.
   Jackson said Sunday that letters threatening more assassinations
had led to a ``backlash, not a backlash of fear, but of
determination.''
   Despite the security concerns, Shinhoster said the bombings have
led to ``a coming together among those of us in the ... human
rights community.''
   Both whites and blacks, he said, can see that the bombings are
``as much an attack on America and her institutions as ... on
individuals.''
   He said the terrorism ``creates a new opportunity to forge new
relationships between blacks and whites.''
   The celebrations of the Emancipation Proclamation, which
President Abraham Lincoln issued to free slaves in the Confederacy
during the Civil War, have been sponsored by the NAACP for 70
years, Shinhoster said. Informal celebrations date from the time
the proclamation went into effect Jan. 1, 1863.

   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey took
over the rotating presidency of the European Economic Community for
six months Monday and pledged support for the emerging democracies
of Eastern Europe.
   ``It's an enormous load of responsibility at this stage to help
guide them politically and to extend economic aid to them,''
Haughey said.
   ``The Community held up a beacon for these countries,'' he said.
``That places a terrific responsibility on the Community to help
guide them. Most of these countries have never known democracy. We
will have to provide an awful lot of aid.''
   Haughey spoke at Dublin Castle, the 13th century building that
will be used to host EEC meetings during Ireland's presidency.
   He raised the Irish tricolor flag, and his son, Dublin's Lord
Mayor Sean Haughey, raised the EEC flag. Similar flag-raising
ceremonies were held in 19 other Irish communities.
   Ireland took over the EEC presidency from France, and will hand
it over in six months to Italy.

   About 10,000 people staged a noisy but peaceful
demonstration Monday outside the Xinhua News Agency office in Hong
Kong in support of democracy in China.
   The demonstrators shouted slogans and carried banners that read:
``We Love China, Not Communism'' and ``Today Romania, Tomorrow
China.''
   They also voiced support for the overthrow of Communist
governments in Eastern Europe.
   The protesters earlier rallied in downtown Hong Kong before
marching the several miles to the Xinhua office.
   The demonstration was staged by the Hong Kong Alliance in
Support of the Patriotic Movement in China, which has been accused
by Beijing of trying to use the British colony as a base for
subversion in China.
   On Sunday night, the alliance staged a candelight vigil at a
downtown park in support of democracy in China and Romania.
Alliance chairman Sezto Wah told about 2,000 people at the vigil
that recent events in Romania have given tremendous encouragement
to people in China.
   ``The alliance is firmer than ever in its conviction that final
victory shall belong to the people and that one day democracy shall
bloom in China,'' he said.
   Wah and another alliance leader, Martin Lee, were expelled by
Beijing last year from a Hong Kong-China committee drafting the
constitution for the territory when it reverts to Chinese rule in
1997.
   China has pledged to retain Hong Kong's capitalist and legal
systems for 50 years after the takeover. The crushing of the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing last spring by Chinese troops has
raised fears in Hong Kong that China may renege on its promises.

   President and Mrs. Bush, grandparents for
the 12th time, rose before dawn and flew here today to begin the
new year and end a vacation by fishing for bass.
   A beaming Barbara Bush broke the news aboard Air Force One as it
left Houston that youngest son Marvin and daughter-in-law Margaret
have adopted a second child, named Charles Walker Bush.
   ``Want to hear the great news?, Marvin had a little baby ... a
little boy,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters.
   The infant was born in Texas in November and the younger Bushes,
who live in Arlington, Va., got word Friday that he was theirs'
while vacationing at Disney World in Florida with their 3-year-old
daughter, Marshall, who also is adopted.
   The president and first lady left Texas after paying an
emotional visit Sunday to the bedside of soldiers recuperating in
San Antionio military hospitals from wounds suffered in the
invasion of Panama.
   The president after paying tribute to the ``gutsy, courageous
young men,'' said it was ``only fair and right'' that the dictator
they toppled, Manuel Antonio Noriega, be brought to justice in the
United States.
   Mrs. Bush said she and her husband spent a quiet New Year's Eve
at their Houston hotel suite, retiring by 9 p.m. without even
popping the cork on a bottle of champagne.
   ``We had Chinese dinner and candlelight _ only because someone
gave it to us _ and we were the earliest people in bed in America,
I think,'' she said. ``I haven't seen midnight in in 40 years.''he
said.
   The Bushes were returning to the White House tonight, then
flying to Boston on Tuesday for the funeral of a brother-in-law,
Alexander Ellis II, who died Friday at 67 after a stroke and long
illness.
   ``We heard about the baby the day that our brother-in-law died.
There's something nice about that, isn't there? It's sort of
magical,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``I cried all day. I cried from happoiness and sadness all day.
   The first lady called Ellis, husband of Bush's sister Nancy, ``a
wonderful man'' and noted he was ``the first of us'' from their
generation to die.
   Bush, an avid angler, was to cast for bass at a private 55-acre
lake in Pintlala, Ala., owned by pal Ray Scott Jr., publisher of
Bassmaster Magazine.
   The Bushes were moved to tears Sunday as they visited the 44
hospitalized servicemen at the close of a hunting vacation in Texas.
   ``They're gutsy, courageous young men,'' said Bush, who praised
the Panama invasion as ``a superb operation.'' He added, ``there
should be no second-guessing.''
   On continuing efforts to pry Noriega out of the Vatican embassy
in Panama City, where he has been holed up since Dec. 24, Bush
said, ``there's a lot going on and discussions about what'll take
place.''
   ``We want him brought to justice. It's only fair and right to
these kids lying here ... and I'm determined to see that that
happens,'' Bush told reporters.
   Panama's attorney general, Rogelio Cruz, said Sunday he is
preparing to bring murder charges against Noriega for the deaths of
10 rebel officers after Noriega and his Panamanian Defense Forces
quashed a Dec. 3 coup.
   However, Panama's new president, Guillermo Endara, said later
Sunday he is asking Pope John Paul II to release Noriega to U.S.
authorities because the Latin country's courts are in disarray and
currently incapable of trying Noriega, wanted in the United States
as a drug trafficker.
   Bush, after making his rounds at Brooke Army Medical Center and
Wilford Hall Air Force Hospital, called it ``very, very moving for
me and for Barbara.''
   Many of the wounded sported their Purple Hearts on their deep
blue pajamas or pinned them to pillowcases.
   At the bedside of Army Sgt. James Almeida of Taunton, Mass., who
suffered multiple fragmentation wounds, Bush asked the sergeant's
8-year-old daughter, Noella, if she had a good Christmas.
   ``Yes,'' said the child.
   ``What was your favorite present?'' Bush asked.
   ``My daddy,'' the child replied.
   In a lighter moment, Bush narrated a home video for the brother
of wounded Army Pvt. Scout Tout of Amarillo, Texas, and tried his
Spanish with Sgt. Roy Burgess's Panama-born wife, Violetta. Burgess
is from LaBelle, Fla.
   Bush, saying he is ``not too good at that kind of thing,'' asked
his wife to relate an exchange with another soldier left paraplegic
in the Panama fighting.
   ``He thanked George and gave him a flag, a little American flag,
and he said, `This is from all the men in Panama and I want you to
have this from them and we thank you for sending us,''' she said,
adding, ``You can't fake that.''

<TEXT>
   The Panama invasion wasn't an hour old before
the telephone awakened Army Col. Mel Hoherz. It wasn't a day old
before Hoherz had dispatched officers on those dreadful
knock-on-the-door missions to inform families that a son or husband
had died in combat.
   As with everything, the Army has a system for this _ and a
214-page Regulation 600-8-1 on what to do when a soldier is killed.
   An Army manual even tells the visiting officer what to say:
``The secretary of the Army has asked me to express his deep
regret...''
   Hoherz, son of a career Army officer, grandson of a German
pacifist who fled to America to avoid military service, is in
charge of seeing to it the process runs smoothly.
   ``We try to do it with dignity,'' he said in a recent interview.
``Everyone grieves differently, and sometimes they grieve angrily,
in anger at the Army, and we know that, but we try to be helpful.''
   Hoherz's job is to see to it that the body is accompanied to the
gravesite by a soldier _ sometimes by a buddy who has been
designated for the task by the surviving family.
   Hoherz dispatches the ``notifier,'' who brings the first word _
but often no details _ and offers whatever comfort a stranger can.
By regulation, the message is always delivered in person.
   He makes sure that another officer follows up with the forms
that will bring the family the benefits to which it is entitled _
usually a $50,000 life insurance payment plus a $3,000 death
gratuity payment; the soldier's unpaid pay and allowances; a
monthly check for the widow until she remarries and surviving
children until they are age 18 (23 if they go to college); and
Social Security benefits.
   He tries to nudge families toward opting for a military funeral.
``We can do it with great dignity and they don't need an unexpected
$5,000 expense at a time like this,'' Hoherz says. The Army will
provide a steel casket worth $2,000, six pallbearers and a
seven-member firing team that fires three volleys of shots.
   And Hoherz makes sure word reaches the White House, where
President Bush has determined to write a personal letter to the
family of every military man killed in the line of duty.
   Panama marked the first American battle deaths since the Grenada
episode in 1983, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen.
   In Panama, the U.S. military suffered 23 deaths _ 18 Army, four
Navy, one Marine _ and 322 wounded. Among Panamanians, 297 soldiers
and some 300 civilians were killed.
   Panama aside, the Army had 116 military related deaths in 1989 _
helicopter crashes, training accidents, heart attacks and the like
and about 625 other accidental deaths, mostly car crashes.
   Hoherz's outfit _ the Casualties and Memorial Affairs Operations
Center in suburban Alexandria, Va. _ seeks to notify the family
within four hours of receiving word of the casualty.
   The old process is still used. An officer or senior
non-commissioned officer is sent from a nearby military base.
Sometimes he brings along a chaplain. No mission is undertaken
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   In these days of family mobility and frequent divorce, Hoherz
says, notifiers often must do detective work to track down
relatives or estranged wives, sometimes using the police or postman
or utility company records.
   How to do it is spelled out in a 53-page manual that uses the
initials ``NOK'' for ``next of kin.''
   ``As a notifier, you represent the secretary of the Army,'' the
manual says. ``You are expected to be courteous, helpful and
sympathetic toward the NOK in this sensitive mission. Your presence
should soften the blow, if possible, and show the Army's concern
for its personnel, their dependents, and their NOK.''
   The visit is followed by a telegram or a mailgram. Its purpose
is to confirm what has been said and to make it clear the family
has not been the victim of a macabre hoax.
   Meantime, at the scene of combat, there is a written report on
the fatal event and an investigation ``if it is an unexplained
death,'' Hoherz says. Families are entitled to these reports and to
autopsy reports, but they must ask for them.
   A company commander, in theory at least, knows the people in his
unit. ``If he's doing his job, he'll know them by name and well
enough to know where they come from and whether they're married,
that sort of thing,'' says Hoherz.
   The company commander writes a letter of condolence to the next
of kin. It is sent within 24 hours if field conditions permit. This
letter often brings the first full account of how the soldier died.

<HEAD>North Demands North-South Korean Travel; Defends Socialism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung said Monday a
border wall in South Korea should be torn down and free north-south
travel ensured as a step toward reunification.
   In a New Year's speech distributed by North Korea's official
Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, the hard-line
Communist leader also denounced what he called a grave
``imperialist'' challenge to socialism.
   ``There can be no change in the truth of history that mankind
must follow the road of socialism,'' Kim said, without directly
mentioning the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   He did refer indirectly to the opening of the wall between
Communist East Germany and the capitalist West.
   In urging the removal of a concrete wall south of the border,
Kim declared: ``Now that both the United States and South Korean
authorities welcome the opening of the barrier of division in
another country, there is no reason why the concrete wall in Korea
should not be destroyed.''
   North Korea and South Korea, divided since 1945, technically are
still in a state of war. An armistice, rather than a peace treaty,
ended the 1950-53 Korean War. The demilitarized zone between the
two is heavily guarded, and Koreans need permission from both
governments to cross the border.
   In South Korea, a dissident Christian pastor has been sentenced
to 10 years in prison and a radical student is on trial for
unauthorized visits to North Korea that they said were aimed at
promoting unification.
   Kim said the two ``came to Pyongyang, at the risk of their
lives, as messengers bearing the South Korean people's unanimous
desire for reunification.''
   Commenting on Seoul's insistence that contacts with North Korea
go through official channels, Kim said reunification is an
important question that ``cannot be placed at the mercy of a few
authorities or of a specified stratum.''
   Seoul says North Korea has been encouraging South Korean
dissidents to visit Pyongyang to try to encourage discord.
   Kim said that when free travel is ensured, ``it will be possible
to achieve the consensus of the will and united efforts of the
Korean nation for reunfication.''
   Negotiations on travel, politics, the economy and culture ``must
be held without delay,'' he said, reiterating a call for a
conference that would include leaders of South Korean opposition
parties.
   ``In our area north of the military demarcation line, there is
no barrier except barbed wires which mark a boundary. We can remove
them anytime,'' Kim said.
   Talks so far on easing tensions and working toward reunification
have made little progress, with each side insisting on its own
proposals.
   In Seoul, South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon said he
expects arms control talks between the two nations will be possible
in the mid-1990s, the Korea Herald said Monday.
   ``Our efforts to achieve peaceful unification of the divided
Korean peninsula need to initiate arms control talks between the
two halves,'' Lee said in an interview with the English-language
daily.
   Lee also said North Korea, beset by economic difficulties
resulting from its continuing arms buildup, could not continue to
ignore the democratric reforms sweeping Eastern Europe and may be
forced to come out of isolation.
   In his remarks on the international scene, Kim said ``the
imperialists are making frantic efforts to undermine socialism.''
   ``Recently, the U.S. imperialists declared before the world the
end of the cold war and the advent of an era of peace, but this was
immediately followed by their open invasion against Panama, a
sovereign state. This shows clearly that `peace' and `detente'
claimed by the imperialists is a big deception and that they are
outrageous aggressors.''
   Kim said ``the road to socialism is an untrodden path.
Therefore, in the course of advance one may encounter unexpected
incidents and undergo trials and tribulations. The way of building
socialism should also be steadily improved and perfected in keeping
with the change in the situation. But there can be no change in the
truth of history that mankind must follow the road of socialism.''
   Japanese radio monitors said that in Kim's New Year messages to
other leaders, North Korea gave first place to China instead of the
Soviet Union. Like Kim, Chinese leaders have vowed not to deviate
from socialism.
   North Korean media did not mention messages to East Germany,
Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, although messages to those East
European countries have been prominently mentioned in past years.

   One of the latest Superfund successes
felt like a long wait to Ralph Bidgood, whose four-year ordeal
began the night he discovered some people probing the dirt behind
his mobile home.
   ``There were people in white suits and rubber gloves and rubber
boots walking around and I started wondering what was going on,''
Bidgood said.
   He found that his home sat atop a toxic waste dump that had been
oozing arsenic, benzene, cyanide and lead into drinking wells and
the nearby Black River and Seavers Brook for up to 40 years.
   An EPA official termed the site ``a chemical time bomb'' and
said it was the only Superfund site in New England that had people
living on top of it.
   Bidgood's ordeal is over. On Friday, his trailer _ like 33
others in the park _ was purchased by the polluters and Bidgood
moved to an apartment. Three remaining trailers will soon be
purchased.
   ``This is the first and probably the only site in New England
that involves permanent relocation of residents,'' said Paul
Keough, acting regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. He termed the site a time bomb in 1988, well
after it was added to the Superfund list in 1982.
   In an agreement announced last month, four parties _
Springfield, Emhart Industries Inc., Textron Inc. and
Browning-Ferris Industries _ have admitted liability for the
pollution and agreed to pay the EPA $1.75 million. The site was
once a town landfill.
   They also will provide millions to build a pipeline system to
collect the seepage and a treatment plant to remove the chemicals,
Town Manager William Steele said. The treatment and monitoring will
continue for 30 years.
   The companies also set up a trust fund to buy the mobile homes.
   The total cleanup cost could reach $15 million, Keough said. He
said he could not estimate how much of that would be federal money,
nor could he say how much in federal funds has been spent so far.
   The EPA also has identified nine other parties that may be held
liable for the pollution. That investigation is continuing.
   Although the EPA has been criticized by state and local
officials for the long process, most officials agree that a
settlement probably would not have been reached without its
involvement.
   ``The potentially responsible parties would like to pretend that
those dumps don't exist at all,'' said former U.S. Sen. Robert
Stafford of Vermont, who drafted the Superfund legislation while
chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. ``They
won't do anything until the EPA gets after them.''
   The federal Superfund program cleans toxic waste dumps around
the country. A 1985 reauthorization of the program set aside $8.5
billion for the cleanups. The EPA's National Priorities List
currently names about 1,250 hazardous waste sites.
   The EPA tries to get polluters to pay for the cleanups.
Nationally, it has collected more than $1 billion in cleanup
expenses.
   Springfield, a town of about 10,000 in southeastern Vermont, was
dominated by its machine tools industry for about 150 years.
   From 1946 to 1968, those factories dumped their industrial waste
in the town landfill, which was built on eight acres on a hill
overlooking the town.
   ``Everything was done according to the environmental regulations
at the time,'' Steele said. ``The whole thing was done with the
idea, `Well, let's do something environmentally sound. Rather than
dump it in the river, let's put it in this landfill.'''
   After the dump reached capacity and closed, it ultimately was
used as a mobile home park beginning in 1971, about the same time
that surrounding residents began complaining of odor and
discoloration of their well water.
   ``They studied the problem for eight years,'' Steele said.
``There was a perception that the EPA was taking too long.''
   Keough said the lengthy process is necessary and added that the
EPA's cautious and expensive pace may even encourage polluters to
admit liability.
   ``I think there's a feeling in the private sector that they can
do it quicker and cheaper than the federal government,'' Keough
said. ``It's to their advantage to get on board early.''
   Bidgood, 43, moved to the site several years after it was put on
the Superfund list but said he didn't know that until several years
later when he saw the environmental inspectors digging in his yard.
   Bidgood settled with the polluters for $31,000. While packing
his belongings Thursday, he vowed not to release the polluters from
any future liability if he gets ill.
   ``I'm not really scared about it, but I'm not signing off on
it,'' he said. ``I just want to get out of here.''

   The bells of St. Basil's Cathedral rang out over
Red Square Monday for the first time since 1922, when the atheist
Soviets clamped down on the operations of the Russian Orthodox
church.
   More than 100,000 Muscovites poured into the vast square more
often used military parades, and streamed past the Kremlin and the
mausoleum of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin to gather around the
colored cupolas of St. Basil's for several bell concerts on New
Year's Day.
   ``It's a surprise for the heart,'' said a middle-aged woman with
a wistful smile.
   ``It's like visiting the past,'' said Victor Kisin, a member of
the Soviet parliament, who leaned against a lamp post listening to
the discordant song.
   The crowd covered all ages, from toddlers bundled against the
cold to elderly women wrapped in traditional flowered Russian
headscarves, listening raptly to the bells as they throbbed and
occasionally clanked. When the scheduled 15-minute concert was
completed, the crowd clapped until bell master Ivan Danilov
continued with two encores.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, authorities have
dramatically reduced harassment of religious believers. Thousands
of churches, mosques, and other religious buildings, which had been
converted into museums, cabbage warehouses, offices and even a
swimming pool, are being returned to their original uses.
   St. Basil's is still a museum of architecture. Completed in
1560, its brilliantly colored, fanciful onion domes are a
world-famous symbol for the Soviet Union.
   Its religious use was reduced in 1922 when it was downgraded
from a cathedral to a church, and religious operations ceased
entirely in 1929, museum officials said.
   While many Soviets are rediscovering religion, the audience for
Monday's bell concert reflected the fact that after decades of
suppression, most Soviets view religion more with curiosity than
with fervor.
   ``Such traditions are wonderful,'' said one woman, lamenting the
decades during which the bells were silent. Once, she said, Moscow
had 40 cathedrals and their bells gave the city its character.
   ``We lost our roots,'' added Victor Moiseyenko, who brought his
toddler, Irina, to the cathedral so she might find them.
   Whipping in the wind in the background were bright blue and
white banners containing snowflakes and holiday greetings. New
Year's decorations this year were remarkably free of the usual
political slogans.

   Cuba is beginning the new year on an upbeat
note after a string of setbacks as it assumes a U.N. Security
Council seat for the first time since the 1959 revolution.
   Some U.S. officials are concerned that Cuba's election to a
council seat will give President Fidel Castro new leverage for
influencing council debates and promoting anti-American policies.
   But more optimistic officials believe Cuba may feel constrained
in its new role to diminish its alleged support for leftist rebels
in El Salvador.
   Cuba will assume its seat as the United Nations gears up to send
a peacekeeping force to Central America to ensure that rebel forces
such as the Salvadoran insurgency do not receive outside assistance.
   In response to American criticism, Cuba contends that no country
tramples on U.N. principles more relentlessly than the United
States.
   As Cuba sees it, the invasion of Panama is just the latest
example of the U.S. interventionism. After the invasion, there were
large demonstrations in front of the American diplomatic mission in
Havana.
   Cuba's accession to a Security Council seat is a bright spot in
an otherwise-bleak period for the island nation. Cuba had close
ties with all of the governments in Eastern Europe that have been
forced out in recent months. Ideologically, Cuba has never been
more isolated.
   The ouster of Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was also seen
as a loss for Cuba because the leaders of both countries had a
shared hostility for the United States.
   U.S. officials are particularly disappointed over Cuba's
elevation to a council seat because other Latin American countries
rallied behind Cuba's candidacy last year over U.S. objections.
   U.N. tradition holds that the election of a given country is
automatic if it receives the endorsement by consensus of other
countries from the same region.
   The United States tried to encourage other hemispheric countries
to oppose Cuba's candidacy. Several tested the waters but dropped
out, leaving Cuba uncontested.
   On the other hand, the administration did block a movement in
the Organization of American States in the fall to allow the Cuban
government to reclaim its OAS seat. Cuba was expelled from the OAS
in the early 1960s.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Latin Americans yielded to Castro's U.N. candidacy because
``they were unwilling to take on the guy who can make trouble for
them and intimidate them.''
   Gillian Gunn, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, offered a more charitable explanation.
   Ms. Gunn, who visited Cuba in November, said Cuba's image in the
hemisphere was enhanced during the crucial period in the first half
of 1989 when the issue of who would win the council seat was being
decided.
   Cuba's improved standing was the result of its decision in
December 1988 to withdraw its troops from Angola and Castro's
attendance at three Latin American presidential inaugurations in
late 1988 and early 1989, she said.
   Castro's presence implied respect for democratic processes in
the hemisphere. American officials were disappointed that Latin
American and Caribbean democracies _ now the overwhelming majority
_ would rally behind an unelected president for one of the 10
non-permanent Security Council seats.
   But there was some sentiment in the hemisphere that Cuba
deserved the seat after having been systematically excluded for
more than 30 years.
   In addition, a Latin American president told a U.S. diplomat
privately that Castro is likely to behave more moderately if he is
treated as a member of the club rather than as an outcast.
   But, said Otto Reich, a former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, the
Latin Americans are wrong to think that Castro is no longer a
threat.
   ``They are engaging in a bit of self-deception by thinking that
he has,'' Reich said.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka To Negotiate On Indian Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka will negotiate with India
this week to speed up the withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping troops,
a Foreign Ministry official said Monday.
   The pullout had been scheduled for Sunday but was delayed until
March 31 after V.P. Singh replaced Rajiv Gandhi as India's prime
minister in December.
   Foreign Secretary Bernard Tillekeratne will fly to New Delhi on
Tuesday to start the discussions, the Foreign Ministry official
said.
   Depending on how the talks go, Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne
may join Tillekeratne in the Indian capital on Thursday, the
official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In New Delhi, however, a spokesman for the Indian Foreign
Ministry said no dates for the talks had been fixed. The Indian
spokesman, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
expected Wijeratne to arrive about Friday.
   The Sri Lankan official said there have been ``positive
responses from New Delhi'' that India might speed up its March 31
deadline for pulling out the last members of the peacekeeping
force, the official said.
   But the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``I don't know,
really, what they're basing that on.''
   The Indian government invited both Wijeratne and Tillekeratne,
who is the second-highest official in Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry,
to New Delhi for talks this week, Indian officials in Colombo and
New Delhi said.
   In September, India and Sri Lanka agreed the Indian troops would
leave by 1990. But India said the pullout would take longer after
Singh took office. Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said
the withdrawal should be completed by March 31.
   Sri Lanka says it wants the deadline moved up so it can be host
of a seven-nation summit of South Asian leaders in early April.
Colombo was scheduled to be the venue for the 1989 summit of the
South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation, but President
Ranasinghe Premadasa refused to be host while foreign troops
remained in his country.
   Indian soldiers were sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 under an
accord signed by Gandhi and Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R.
Jayewardene. The peace pact was designed to end a revolt by Tamil
guerrillas who sought to create a separate homeland for their
ethnic minority in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   India initially deployed only 2,000 men to supervise a surrender
of arms by Tamil fighters. But the largest Tamil militia reneged on
the pact and started fighting the Indians.
   New Delhi's involvement in the internal affairs of its small
neighbor escalated, with the peacekeeping force numbering about
100,000 men at its peak.
   In 1989, Indian troops withdrew in phases from six of the eight
districts where they had been based. An estimated 25,000 remain.
   India got involved in Sri Lanka because of pressure from its
politically powerful Tamil minority who sympathized with fellow
Tamils in Sri Lanka.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
island's government and military are controlled by the Sinhalese,
who account for 75 percent of the population.
   At least 17,000 people have been killed since the Tamil
insurrection began in 1983. About 11,000 people, including 1,100
Indian soldiers, were killed in the northeast where most Tamils
live.

   Hailing 1989 as ``so rich in profound
changes,'' Pope John Paul II on Monday dedicated the first day of
the new year to peace and the triumph of life over violence and
revenge.
   The Roman Catholic leader, after a midmorning New Year's Day
Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, shed his gold-embroidered robes and
miter for a red cape and white skullcap and came out under a chilly
noon sun onto his balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.
   Listening to his prayer were tens of thousands of people who
filled the cobblestone square, made festive with a 100-foot,
tinsel-draped tree from Austria.
   The pope spoke of the ``the contemporary world's expectations
for peace, the expectations of our days so full of significant
deeds, so rich in profound changes.''
   He also cited ``the intense desire that justice and love prevail
over all the temptations toward violence, revenge and corruption.''
   The Polish-born pontiff noted the start of the millennium's last
decade, by praying: ``Let us ask God to help us ... construct the
hoped-for civilization of love.''
   He also noted that in these times ``we feel with growing
evidence how important are, and how high the cost is of, the rights
and values of solidarity between nations.''
   There was no mention of specific world conflicts in his prayer
from the balcony nor during his homily during Mass.
   Monsignor Piero Pennacchini, a Vatican spokesman, said the Holy
See had no comment Monday on word out of Panama that the Panamanian
government will ask the Vatican embassy there to hand over Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The ousted Panamanian military ruler took refuge in the
Vatican's mission in Panama City Dec. 24, and the United States and
the Holy See have been negotiating over his fate.
   President Bush wants the Vatican to turn over Noriega so he can
be tried on U.S. charges of drug trafficking.
   During his balcony appearance, John Paul expressed the wish that
governments worldwide would ``dedicate themselves to the cause of
peaceful co-existence, of respect for civil rights and fundamental
liberties.''
   In the late 1960s, Paul VI began designating the first day of
the year as ``World Peace Day,'' and this year's theme was the
environment.
   ``Indeed, peace requires a particular responsibility of man for
all creation,'' John Paul said in his sermon during morning Mass.
   The pope said the commandment, ``Thou shalt not kill'' also
applied to abortion and to the following ``methods of struggle:
violence, terrorism, war, mass extermination.''

   Veronica Prego had everything to look forward to
at the age of 25 as she embarked on a medical career. Until, she
says, she pricked her finger with an AIDS-contaminated needle and
the future came crashing down.
   Seven years later, Prego's $175 million negligence lawsuit is
going to trial Tuesday, while she fights to survive the ravages of
AIDS.
   Prego's lawyer, Diane Wilner, says Prego sued Kings County
Hospital, its parent agency, the city and two doctors to ensure
that other doctors are protected. It's her No. 1 priority _ at
least, on the days that she's not being rushed to an emergency room
with AIDS-related maladies.
   ``She will die from it _ that's a fact,'' said Wilner. ``The
only question is when.''
   But there are many other questions _ about how Prego contracted
the disease, about how much a hospital should do to protect workers
from AIDS.
   The case is ``terribly important'' because it could set a
precedent that hospitals are liable when an employee is infected,
said Larry Gostin, associate professor of health law at the Harvard
School of Public Health and executive director of the American
Society of Law and Medicine.
   Even before the trial, there has been sensationalism.
   There have been charges that the defendants' lawyers stalled so
Prego would die before the case went to trial. The state attorney
general's office subpoenaed her sympathy cards to ferret out
sympathetic jurors.
   In legal briefs, lawyers for the Health and Hospitals Corp.,
which operates city hospitals, have complained about newspapers'
``sleazy'' reporting on the case, charging that they printed
``propaganda'' without regard to the truth.
   It comes down to what a jury will believe happened in January
1983.
   Prego was a medical school graduate working under a licensed
physician in preparation for a hospital internship. She says she
was cleaning up after an intern, Dr. Joyce Fogel, when she reached
into a tangle of gauze and bed linens in which Fogel had
``negligently and improperly'' left a bloody needle.
   The hospital's side: ``Dr. Fogel has stated adamantly that she
wasn't present when the blood was drawn and did not cause the
injury _ she wasn't there,'' said Fred Winters, spokesman for
Health and Hospitals.
   ``There are two different versions of how Dr. Prego received her
injury,'' said Winters. The defense has refused to elaborate.
   Wilner said Prego reported her injury because the needle had
been used to draw blood from a known AIDS patient.
   ``The powers that be assured her there were no reports of a
health care worker getting AIDS through occupational exposure. At
that time, that may very well have been a true statement,'' Wilner
said.
   Prego argues that the hospital failed to provide
puncture-resistant containers for contaminated needles. Winters
said HHC hospitals were ``in the forefront of following the known
precautions'' against AIDS transmission at the time.
   In 1985, Prego tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus
when she agreed to take part in a study on the incidence of the
virus among health-care workers.
   Prego says the researcher, Dr. Sheldon Landesman of the State
University of New York, told hospital personnel she was infected,
even though she had been promised the results were confidential. He
has denied any breach of confidentiality, but she has sued him as
well.
   In November 1987, Prego was diagnosed as having AIDS. She
completed a fellowship from home and now works on research when her
health permits.
   Despite her illness, she intends to testify at trial. She is not
available for interviews.
   The Centers for Disease Control has documented 19 cases, and are
investigating several others, of health workers who contracted the
virus at work. Twelve of them were stuck by needles, said CDC
spokesman Chuck Fallis.
   Kings County Hospital and the HHC say they acted prudently to
protect employees from AIDS. They argue that Prego's should be a
worker's compensation case.
   Prego has said she fears the city ``wants me to die'' before
trial can start.
   Hospital officials vehemently deny that.
   ``We have taken every step we can to expedite Dr. Prego's case
so that she will have an opportunity to pursue her claim,'' said
Winters. He said the hospital had waived a procedure that would
have delayed the trial another year.

   Labor and industry officials today announced
tentative settlement of the bitter, nine-month Pittston Coal strike
that has idled 1,700 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   ``We came to what I really believe is a ... reasonable solution
to both sides. It is fair and it is honorable,'' special mediator
W.J. Usery said at a news conference in the office of Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Agreement was reached in the first hours of 1990 following six
days of marathon negotiations.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka said it is too
early to say when the miners will return to work and that they
would first have to ratify the agreement.
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, with both sides
saying they wanted the miners to hear details from their leaders.
Trumka said the specifics should be in the hands of the rank and
file within eight to 10 days.
   Both sides they were happy with the agreement.
   ``We just couldn't be happier to stand before you today _ We
think we've met the essential objectives of all those concerned,''
said Pittston Co. Chairman Paul W. Douglas.
   Mrs. Dole said one of the most difficult issues was ``the
long-term security'' of the pension and health care benefits for
the miners and their families.
   Pittston had balked at continuing payments into a pension fund,
a move that had preciptated the walkout.
   Mrs. Dole said she will appoint a commission to ``review all
aspects of the pension and health-care issue and make
recommendations to me for dealing with it.''
   She said the commission would report to her within six months.
   Trumka stressed the commission was not part of the settlement
and said the provisions for resolving the dispute over Pittston
payments did not involve any type of interim arrangment.
   ``The funds issue has been settle between Pittston and the
United Mine Workers,'' the union president said.
   The strike, which was punctuated by large labor rallies,
vandalism and rock-throwing confrontations between strikers and
other company workers, began April 5.
   Organized labor rallied around the strike, with some 46,000 coal
workers in 10 states walking off their jobs in sympathy strikes at
one point.
   In Charleston, West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton said, ``I
think that it's the greatest way we could start the new year. This
has been a very long strike and a very difficult strike for the
miners and their families.''
   Both sides had been under a gag order during the talks at a
downtown Washington hotel.
   Usery, a former labor secretary, had said he hoped to reach a
tentative settlement by New Year's Day.
   The union workers struck in April after Pittston decided to end
contributions to the UMW retirement and health plans for some
130,000 workers. The union said the decision could cause other coal
companies to follow suit and retired miners would lose their
benefits.
   Pittston, the nation's largest coal exporter, says it cannot
afford the payments because it faces high costs to ship its coal
overseas.
   The UMW also said job security was threatened because Pittston
had refused to go along with an industry agreement to give laid-off
workers the first chance at new job openings.
   The UMW raised a strike fund of more than $100 million, giving
striking workers about $200 a week to live on, plus a Christmas
bonus. Miners normally earn up to $635 a week. The union also is
facing fines of $63.5 million for violating court orders limiting
picketing and other strike activities.
   Pittston hired replacement workers, but production has been well
below pre-strike levels. The company reported its coal operations
lost $3.6 million in the second quarter of 1989 and $9.8 million in
the third quarter, compared with profits of $9 million and $7.4
million in the respective quarters of 1988.

   James and Elizabeth, the names of British kings
and queens, were the most popular names for babies born in 1989,
according to the social editor of the Times of London newspaper.
   Of the 2,780 boys whose births were announced in the newspaper
last year, 392 had James as one of their names, 120 ahead of the
runner-up, William, said social editor Helen Beard.
   Of the 2,645 birth announcements for girls, 254 had Elizabeth
among their names, 106 ahead of the second most popular choice,
Charlotte, she said.
   Of the first names chosen, James was also the most popular for
boys, as it has been every year since 1964, Ms. Beard wrote in her
annual letter to the editor outlining parents' selections. James
was followed by Thomas, William, Alexander, Edward, Charles,
Oliver, George, Robert and Henry.
   Elizabeth was only the 10th most popular choice as a first name
for girls, the newspaper reported. Charlotte was the top choice, a
position acquired in 1983 but surrendered to Emma and Alice in 1987
and 1988 respectively.
   Charlotte was followed by Emily, Sophie, Emma, Alice, Olivia,
Alexandra, Katherine, Lucy and then Elizabeth.
   Britain has had two queens named Elizabeth, including the
current monarch, Elizabeth II, and two King James. William, Edward,
Charles, George, Henry, Charlotte, Alice and Alexandra are also
names associated with the royal family past and present.

   Week after week, despairing Czechoslovaks saw
the tormented face of once-jaunty Alexander Dubcek on television
imploring calm and discipline while he waged a losing struggle to
salvage some freedoms of the 1968 ``Prague Spring.''
   That was in occupied Czechoslovakia after Soviet and Warsaw Pact
troops invaded nearly 22 years ago. Dubcek faded from view in late
1969 and was seldom mentioned publicly during a politically grim
``Prague Winter'' that lasted a generation.
   Czechoslovakia's political winter is ending now with a dramatic,
Soviet-blessed peaceful rollback of hardline communist rule. Last
Thursday, Dubcek was elected chairman of the federal assembly,
restoring him to honor and position after two decades in political
oblivion.
   Also, dissident playwright Vaclav Havel was elected president of
the republic, Czechoslovakia's first non-communist state chief
since Eduard Benes resigned in 1948.
   Dubcek's return to official life at age 68 is regarded as
historic justice in a country that made him one of communism's few
idolized party leaders. There even were Dubcek fan clubs after the
Soviet invasion.
   But popular demands for multi-party democracy suggest
Czechoslovaks will not settle now for what Dubcek offered 22 years
ago _ ``socialism with a human face.''
   Dubcek said in 1968 he wanted to transform Czechoslovakia's
hardline, Stalinist system into a kinder, gentler form of communist
rule that permitted free assembly and speech. He said the
communists should preserve their monopoly of power not through
repression but by earning the right to lead.
   Dubcek, ousted from party leadership and later from membership,
has not said whether he will seek reinstatement.
   A prominent Czechoslovak-American, Ohio State University
historian and journalism professor Jiri Hochman, said the Communist
Party ``has become irrelevant and Dubcek must know it.'' But, he
said, ``knowing him I would guess he would like to get back'' in
the party.
   ``Prague Spring'' euphoria in Czechoslovakia was marked by a
series of cliff-hanging facedowns between the Dubcek camp and
forces headed by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Dubcek argued that
reforms would rejuvenate rather than weaken communism.
   Even after the Soviet invasion, popular outrage in
Czechoslovakia enabled the Dubcekites to hang on for months of
struggle to preserve some freedoms.
   Support for Dubcek upset Soviet plans to install a puppet
government and prompted the Kremlin to bring Dubcek, Prime Minister
Oldrich Cernik and other arrested Prague leaders to Moscow to
negotiate their resumption of office and a forced program of
``normalization.''
   With a new slogan of ``We Are With You, Be With Us,'' the
haggard, sad-faced Dubcek made frequent television appearances
cautioning his countrymen not to provoke the Soviets.
   He often broke the bad news about ``normalization measures''
that included ouster of popular leaders, ``temporary'' basing of
Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia and restored censorship.
   Some critics say today that Dubcek gave in too easily, failing
to exploit his own popularity and the country's solidarity.
   Dubcek never once drew a line on the rollback and warned the
Soviets not to cross it, said Dr. Jiri Kotas, a Czech who has lived
in exile in Canada since 1979 and is organizing a conservative
party to enter Czechoslovakia's promised free elections in June.
   The Kremlin slowly achieved the results Brezhnev sought. Some
said the Prague Spring really ended with the ``ice hockey riots''
in March 1969.
   Czechoslovakia's victory over the Soviet Union in a semifinal
match at the Stockholm world championships unleashed pent-up
Czechoslovak political feelings. Dancing in the snow-covered
streets turned into anti-Soviet rioting.
   Moscow branded the episode a serious provocation and threatened
to redeploy military force against civilians. Dubcek went on
television with ``an urgent request for peace and discipline.''
   On April 17, 1969, hardliner Gustav Husak replaced him as party
chief and Dubcek was demoted to federal assembly chairman,
ironically the same post he reassumed Thursday.
   In December 1969, Dubcek was sent as ambassador to Turkey.
Passing up an opportunity to defect to the West, he returned to
Czechoslovakia and in mid-1970 was expelled from the Communist
Party.
   Dubcek spent the ensuing years clerking and running a forestry
office in Slovakia.

   A brawl triggered by a bomb scare in a
hotel led to the arrest of a college basketball coach, his two sons
and four other people, officials said.
   ``This was a disturbance of major proportions,'' police Maj.
Edward J. Collins said. Police said said Sunday morning's half-hour
melee involved as many as 75 people, including patrons of the
Marriott Hotel's bar, hotel security guards, police and members of
the Florida Institute of Technology team, which hours earlier had
won a holiday tournament at Bryant College.
   The coach, Thomas J. Folliard, 49, was charged with obstructing
a police officer, a misdemeanor, and held overnight.
   About 1 a.m., police received two calls _ which police said were
made from a pay phone in the Marriott lobby _ saying a bomb had
been planted in the sound equipment of a band playing in the
Cahoots Lounge.
   As police evacuated the bar, a fight broke out between security
officers and Gregory McGiver, 24, a member of the Folliard party,
police said. A police officer wrestled McGiver to the ground.
   A brawl ensued, authorities said.
   When police cleared the bar, the sound equipment was searched
and no bomb or evidence of tampering was found.
   The two Folliard sons, who live with their father in Melbourne,
Fla., were treated for minor injuries before being jailed. Thomas
Folliard Jr. was charged with simple assault and obstruction of a
police officer, and Kevin Folliard was charged with obstruction and
resisting arrest.
   Four other people, including McGiver, were arrested on similar
charges.
   They were released Sunday on bail pending a Jan. 12 court
hearing. By Sunday afternoon Folliard and his team had checked out
of the Marriott and caught a plane to Florida.

   Text of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
New Year's address to the people of the United States, as
translated from Russian by the official Tass news agency:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dear citizens of the United States of America, I greet you on
behalf of the Soviet people and convey the words of hope to you.
The year 1990 can and must bring nearer a genuinely peaceful period
of world history.
   There are still both hesitations, wait-and-see attitudes, doubts
and suspicions. But all this only reaffirms the crucial nature of
the current situation.
   The entire world proceeds ahead. It wants happiness, freedom and
prosperity. And it would be naive, senseless and dangerous to try
to thwart this aspiration for a better future.
   We are deeply convinced that an epoch of peace is feasible. We,
the Soviet Union and the United States, it seems, have already made
a choice, the choice in favor of cooperation.
   During the Malta meeting, President Bush and I agreed that it
was essential to get away from the Cold War and to abandon the Cold
War instruments as well, so that 1990 and subsequent years could
open up a period of genuine cooperation before us.
   In that case, in an atmosphere of greater trust we would begin
to build a world ruling out subversive action, pressure,
interference and armed invasions that do not credit either to
weapons or politics.
   We in the Soviet Union have begun to advance towards such a
future. This goal is served by our perestroika. But we are
convinced that all societies existing on earth are in need of
reasonable transformation.
   Philosophers and historians maintain that the end of any century
creates a special psychological atmosphere that combines nostalgia
for the outgoing year, uncertainty and even some fear about new and
unknown, and invariably hopes for a better life.
   And still, there is a great difference between people of the end
of last century and the end of this century. The main difference is
that we realize that the stronger the hope, the more vigorous and
joint efforts are needed to translate it into reality.
   I suggest making the 1990s a decade of the drawing of the United
States and the Soviet Union closer together on the basis of
universal human values and the balance of interests, and together
with all countries ridding the world of fears and mistrust, of
unnecessary weapons, of outdated political concepts and military
doctrines, and artificial barriers between people and states.
   The year 1990 could become a genuine turning point in the
efforts to limit and reduce arms. We, on our part, shall do
everything for that.
   At the same time, our two countries could do much for further
improvement of the overall moral and political climate in the
world. In this case one may have no doubt that we shall bring
nearer the transformation of the world and will make it more calm
and reasonable.
   The 1990s may become a decade when freedom, democracy and
equality will begin to be established on a global scale and in an
increasingly irreversible way.
   People may say that all these are long-known truths and age-old
values. this is so, indeed. But never before were we prepared so
well for implementing them as now, at the turn of the 20th century.
Let us work purposefully, patiently and with belief in their
triumph.
   I want to wish good health and every success to all citizens of
the United States. I wish your children and grandchildren to become
happy dwellers of the 21st century which will, of course, be better
than ours if we combine our efforts for the sake of that.
   I wholeheartedly wish all Americans a happy new year.
   Thank you.

   Police said Monday they have discovered 10
letter bombs sent from Cyprus in the past three days and addressed
to Christian clergymen and Israelis throughout the country.
   All were dismantled by demolition experts at a postal center
before reaching their destinations, said National Police spokesman
Adi Gonen. He refused to identify the addressees.
   The booby-trapped envelopes were postmarked Dec. 27 in Nicosia
or Larnaca, said postal service spokesman Assaf Becker. They
contained enough explosives ``to kill anyone who tries to open the
envelope,'' Becker said on Israel radio.
   Police suspect other letter-bombs could be on their way and
cautioned citizens in radio announcements against opening any
envelopes lacking a familiar return address.
   In a related development, police safely dismantled a cluster
grenade planted beneath the front wheel of a vehicle owned by the
wife of Vice Premier Sonya Peres in north Tel Aviv, Israeli radio
reported.
   An Israeli extremist group called the Sicarites claimed
responsibility in a phone call to Armed Forces radio station, the
radio reported. The Sicarites are named for a radical sect that
assassinated opponents in Roman times.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush in a New Year's message invited
the people of the Soviet Union today to ``look forward to a new
century, and a new millennium, of peace, freedom and prosperity.''
   In a video message broadcast on Soviet television, Bush said,
``There are no maps to lead us where we are going, to this new
world of our own making. We can find our way only through
cooperation beginning with a candid dialogue.''
   He praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``a good
partner in peace'' and said, ``On behalf of the American people, my
wife, Barbara, and my family, I bring you our warmest greetings.''
   In a companion message sent to U.S. broadcasters, Gorbachev
said, ``The year 1990 can and must bring nearer a genuinely
peaceful period of world history. There are still both hesitations,
wait-and-see attitudes, doubts and suspicions. But all this only
reaffirms the crucial nature of the current situation.''
   Gorbachev called for making the 1990s ``a decade of the drawing
of the United States and the Soviet Union closer together on the
basis of universal human values and the balance of interests, and
together with all countries ridding the world of fears and
mistrust, of unnecessary weapons, of outdated political concepts
and military doctrines, and artificial barriers between people and
states.
   The messages continued an exchange began by Gorbachev and former
President Reagan in the mid-1980s.
   ``Given the war-torn history of this century we should redouble
our efforts to forge a new century of peace and freedom,'' said
Bush, who taped his message in Washington before going to Texas on
vacation last week.
   Bush noted that ``our nations have produced'' Abraham Lincoln,
Soviet novelist Leo Tolstoy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr. and Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov.
   ``We have persevered as allies in a terrible war. The challenges
we face today are no less daunting. But with goodwill and
determination on both sides, I am confident our two peoples will be
equal to the task.''
   He said such a dialogue took place at his recent summit in Malta
with Gorbachev, saying ``I told your president that I support the
dynamic process of reform in the Soviet Union.''
   ``We will work together to reduce barriers to trade, investment
and the free movement of goods and ideas. In these ways, and as
your economic reforms take place, the entry of the Soviet Union
into the global market can be advanced.''
   Bush reiterated that the United States, as well as NATO allies,
``seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes under way'' in
Eastern Europe.
   ``A new year is dawning around the world _ the first year of the
last decade of the twentieth century. And as the world looks back
to nine decades of war, of strife, of suspicion, let us also look
forward _ to a new century, and a new millennium, of peace, freedom
and prosperity,'' the president said.

<HEAD>Sikh Strike Cripples Business, Transport in Holy City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stores closed and buses and trucks stayed
inside depots in this holy city Monday in response to a strike
called by Sikh militants in Punjab state.
   The All-India Sikh Students Federation claimed their strike was
successful throughout Punjab, but Punjab's top police official said
traffic and business functioned normally in much of the northern
state.
   K.P.S. Gill, the state's director general of police, said there
had been no reports of strike-related violence.
   The strike appeared complete in Amritsar, site of the Golden
Temple, the Sikh faith's holiest shrine.
   Although New Year's eve is widely celebrated in India, stores
normally are open Jan. 1, since it is not an official holiday.
   The Sikh students federation, which functions as the youth wing
of the movement to create a separate Sikh homeland in Punjab,
called the strike to press demands for general amnesty for Sikhs
arrested since 1978.
   They also demanded punishment for Hindu rioters who killed more
than 2,000 Sikhs in northern India in 1984 after Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed in retaliation for her decision to send
the army into the Golden Temple to dislodge armed Sikh separatists.
About 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the 1984 raid.
   Sikh agitation for independence or autonomy for Punjab exploded
into violence seven years ago. Sikh extremists have killed at least
7,500 people in Punjab since 1982.
   Five people were killed in the first hours of 1990, Press Trust
of India reported.
   The news agency said the victims included a Sikh police
constable who was dragged out of a New Year's celebration at his
family's home in the village of Ratta near Amritsar.
   The constable, Jaswant Singh, was shot and killed in a field
early Monday.
   Although the Sikh radicals initially targeted Hindus in their
campaign of violence, in the last few years they have attacked
Sikhs who do not support their cause.
   The radicals have rarely called strikes to highlight their
cause, relying mostly on individual killings at night and
occaasional massacres.
   The police blamed at least 1,821 deaths in 1989 on the
extremists in Punjab where Sikhs are in a slight majority.
   Nationwide they comprise 2 percent of the population. Sikhs
militants have accused the Hindu-dominated national government
cultural and political discrimination.
   Hinuds make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people.

   An army patrol was shot at Monday from across
the Israeli-Jordanian border, but there were no casualties, the
military command said.
   The patrol moving along the border near the northern settlement
of Hamat Gader came under fire from the direction of the Jordanian
border before dawn, the military said.
   ``Soldiers in the patrol returned fire but later searches in the
area failed to find anything,'' said an army spokesman, who cannot
be identified due to standing regulations.
   He said there were no Israeli casualties and no damage caused
from the shooting. Jordanian soldiers also were seen searching the
area on their side of the border, he said.
   Hamat Gader is about 4{ miles east of the Sea of Galilee.
   Two Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in a similar shooting
attack on Sept. 16, which news reports in Israel blamed on a
Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his position.
   It was the ninth incident on the Jordanian border since December
1987. At least two of the incidents involved Jordanian soldiers.

   Ethiopian rebels Monday said government
warplanes bombed two villages in the drought-stricken northern part
of the country, killing four people and destroying badly needed
crops.
   The rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front, in a clandestine
radio broadcast, said four government MiG-23 fighter jets bombed
the villages of Adua and Edaga Hamus in Tigre province Thursday,
killing five cattle in addition to causing the civilian casualties
and destroying the crops.
   ``The barbaric act is aimed at subjecting inhabitants of the
area to starvation,'' said the rebel broadcast monitored in
Nairobi. Adua and Edaga Hamus are in northern Tigre, about 25 miles
south of the border with Tigre's northern neighbor, Eritrea.
   The United Nations says crop failures in both provinces have
left as many as 4 million people threatened with famine and
estimates at least 700,000 tons of emergency food will be needed to
stave off starvation. Ethiopia's government estimates only about
1.8 million people will be threatened with starvation.
   Complicating the situation are two long-running civil wars in
Eritrea and Tigre that have placed many people behind rebel lines
and beyond the reach of emergency aid.
   Ethiopia's government two weeks ago said it had asked several
indigenous agencies to study ways in which food could be delivered
to those behind rebel lines in Tigre and to submit a report this
month.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, which took up arms against
President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government in 1975,
controls all of Tigre and has moved south and west into neighboring
provinces since launching a major offensive in September.
   The rebels, who also are Marxists, seek to oust Mengistu and
create a government modeled after the harsh rule of communist
Albania.
   In Eritrea, the Eritrean People's Liberation Army has been
fighting a 29-year secessionist battle for their province.
   Rebel and government claims in the fighting are impossible to
verify independently as reporters have been denied access to the
northern regions.

   Anti-narcotics police fought a gun battle
with drug traffickers Monday in Iran's southeastern Kerman
province, killing five smugglers and wounding seven, Tehran radio
reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said 925 pounds of drugs was
seized.
   Law enforcement agents ambushed the drug traffickers as they
drove through the Kavir-e-Lut desert in Kerman, the report said.
   Iranian media reported similar ambushes or raids last year, part
of an anti-narcotics crackdown launched in December 1987.
   By official accounts more than 1,000 alleged drug smugglers have
been hanged in Iran since then.
   Possession of even small quantities of drugs with intention to
sell carries a mandatory death sentence under Iranian law.
   Iranian opposition groups and other independent organizations
have claimed that many political prisoners are among those hanged
on drugs charges.

   The Pintlala Baptist Church may have a new
recruiting tool: Members get to shake hands with the president of
the United States.
   About two dozens members of the rural church exchanged personal
New Year's Day greetings with President Bush and his wife, Barbara,
as the couple arrived to fish for bass at Alabama sportsman Ray
Scott's 55-acre private lake.
   The hand-shaking took place as the president's 15-vehicle
caravan, including press and security, stopped inside the gate of
Scott's Pintlala estate, where the church members had been allowed
to line up, holding signs of greetings.
   ``It was a surprise. We weren't told that he would stop,'' said
one of the well-wishers, Susan James. ``My heart was racing.
Getting to shake hands with the president of the United States on
the first day of a new decade ...''
   The church members didn't let on that this is getting to be old
hat. Scott, the millionaire founder of the Bass Anglers Sportsman
Society and a friend of Bush for more than a decade, played host to
Bush in December 1988. Pintlala, which boasts a single stoplight,
turned out its residents in force that time to greet the
then-president-elect.
   Monday, cardboard signs held by church members and several dozen
onlookers outside the Scott gate spelled out their uniform glee at
getting to see the president once again, with the first lady as
well.
   ``Good Job George'' and ``Hi Barbara!'' and ``Catch A Big One''
were among the placards. There was little in the way of comment on
domestic or foreign matters, except for a sign held by George
Dudinsky, a retiree who immigrated to America from Hungary in 1951
and was in Pintlala visiting relatives. His sign, with a slight
flaw in grammar, reflected a sentiment from Eastern Europe:
``Hungary Love You.''
   Scott invited three-time Bassmasters Classic Champion Rick Clunn
of Montgomery, Texas, and Forest Wood, the founder of the Ranger
Bass Boat Co., to join the Bushes' fishing party.
   Gov. Guy Hunt and his wife, Helen, and other dignitaries greeted
the president and first lady when they arrived at Maxwell Air Force
Base in Montgomery, prior to the motorcade 15 miles south to
Pintlala. Hunt and other Alabama Republicans were not included in
Scott's group tossing artificial lures into the water on a crisp,
sunny winter day in the rolling, swampy terrain of south Montgomery
County.
   Asked at the airport if he has any New Year's resolution, the
president responded, ``Peace, a world at peace.''
   Outside Scott's gate, Don Williams of Pintlala Baptist Church
assisted church members in moving past security officers who
frisked them one-by-one before allowing them to line up along the
winding driveway.
   Not all the church members on hand were able to get inside the
gate to shake hands with the president. Williams said time was
running short and the security officers simply cut off the number
as the motorcade drew near.
   For those who did get inside, excitement was high.
   Butch Moseley, who sported an Auburn Tiger football sweatshirt,
said the president ``shook my hand and looked at my shirt and said,
`Go, Tigers!.'''

   Rescue crews on Monday recovered the body of a
demolition worker from the rubble of a collapsed seven-story
parking garage.
   One wing of the downtown structure collapsed Sunday while being
demolished and worker Basilio Barrios, 36, of suburban Silver
Spring, Md., was pinned beneath at least 10 tons of concrete, fire
officials said.
   Authorities said two other workers escaped on their own and a
third was freed a short time later by firefighters. The workers
said they were doing routine demolition work on the second floor of
the garage when the structure collapsed without warning.
   The building originally had nine stories, but two had already
been removed.
   A police dog was brought in to help in the search for the
victim. The collapse was being investigated by inspectors from the
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

   President Vaclav Havel, who spent
more than five years in jail for his political beliefs, on Monday
declared a broad New Year's amnesty and reduced sentences for
prison inmates.
   It was not immediately clear how many prisoners would be freed
under the amnesty or how many would benefit from sentence
reductions.
   Havel declared the amnesty three days after he was elected
president, capping a peaceful revolution that ended 41 years of
Communist rule in this country.
   The New Year's day decree applies to all prisoners with the
exception of those indicted for ``abuse of authority of public
official,'' the official CTK news agency said.
   That charge has already been levied against former Prague
Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan, considered responsible for
violent police handling of a peaceful student demonstration on Nov.
17. Stepan was detained Dec. 23 and faces up to 10 years in prison
if convicted.
   Stepan and ex-Communist Party chief Milos Jakes have been
expelled from the party for ``serious political mistakes,'' but
Jakes so far has not been charged.
   Havel, in his New Year's address, said he was declaring the
amnesty and reduction of sentences for humanitarian reasons.
   ``There are many prisoners in our country ... who must live in
jails that do not ... awaken the better part of what is in every
human being, and which humiliate people, destroy them physically
and spiritually,'' Havel said in the nationally televised address
hours before the amnesty was declared.
   ``At the same time I appeal to the prisoners to understand that
40 years of improper investigations, trials and jailing cannot be
eliminated overnight,'' he said.
   Inmates of at least 18 prisons staged hunger strikes last month,
protesting inadequate conditions.
   Havel himself spent more than five years in jail for his
political convictions and is a known critic of the Czechoslovak
judicial system.
   His decree reduces sentences for intentional acts by one third
and sentences for criminal acts out of negligence by one half.
   Before he stepped down Dec. 10, former President Gustav Husak
freed all those who opposition leaders considered political
prisoners.
   However, opposition sources say at least six people are in jail
on charges of espionage, sentenced in secret trials on dubious
evidence.
   Such sentences will be re-examined by the prosecutor general,
according to the text of the amnesty.
   Cases of terrorism, murder, rape and sexual abuse, are excluded
from the amnesty, but all of these sentences are reduced by one
year.
   The amnesty wipes out all misdemeanor charges as well as
suspended sentences including financial fines unless they stem from
a criminal act.
   Havel asked the prosecutor general to re-examine sentences
handed down to pregnant women, mothers of children under 15 years
of age, old and handicapped people.
   In a separate statement, Havel appointed Pavol Sitar the new
prosecutor general.

   Howard Fogelman was shot seven times in Vietnam,
losing all of his teeth and much of his confidence.
   He now lives in the nation's first homeless shelter for
veterans. Sunday, Fogelman and 13 fellow residents felt the
memories flooding back as they watched ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' a new film about a wounded veteran's struggle to cope.
   The vets praised the Oliver Stone movie as they emerged from a
showing of the film, saying they identified with its portrayal of
the isolation felt by veterans returning from the war.
   But unlike real-life vet Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), who
leads anti-war demonstrators and finally feels at home by 1975,
Fogelman and his colleagues are still waging their own war for
dignity in America.
   They feel they are losing.
   At their shelter, the veterans have curfews and other rules they
say are better suited for children than former U.S. servicemen,
some of whom have emotional wounds even though bullet wounds have
mostly healed.
   Fogelman has a large dent in his face where a bullet entered,
and no teeth as a result of the shooting. His last set of false
teeth wore out two years ago and he says bureaucratic red tape has
blocked him from replacing them.
   Without teeth, he has remained jobless and homeless. ``It has a
lot to do with your confidence,'' he said. ``You don't want to
talk.''
   Drugs prescribed during his recovery from the facial wound, he
said, led to a drug habit at home. He's now in a methadone program.
   And he suffers from post-traumatic stress, which for him means
``you could just be sitting and you see images coming on the bus or
the train.''
   He returned home in 1967, he said, to ``a completely different
country.''
   ``It seemed they were protesting everything, especially the war.
It was pretty bad coming home. I'm not bitter now. In this country
you've got to do for yourself,'' Fogelman said.
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he felt angry after watching the movie and
hearing Kovic say he felt he was home again.
   ``I don't think these guys feel they're back home yet. They
still have not reconnected,'' he said.
   ``It's an outrage that there's not enough services and resources
for the homeless veterans,'' Siegel said. ``That ending is 1976 and
it's now 14 years later. We're beginning the '90s and you've got
hundreds of thousands of people who are homeless and hundreds of
homeless vets, perhaps thousands, and its not only in New York City
but in cities across the country.''
   The group included two vets, Ben Colon, 36, and Earl Beddoe, 41,
who have been on a liquid diet since Dec. 17 as a form of protest
for better conditions at their shelter run by the Salvation Army in
Queens.
   ``I believe we gave the best years of our lives. Veterans should
never be homeless,'' said Colon, who walks with a cane because of a
war injury. ``We need Congress to remember our wounds are not
healed yet.''
   The veterans are asking for a say in how the shelter where 400
veterans stay is operated. They say they are treated without
compassion by the staff, and note that only two of 80 on salary are
homeless veterans. They are asking for job training and homes.
   ``It's the quest for dignity,'' said veteran Kevin Brown, 29,
``Not that the country owes us anything. But the country shouldn't
forget, that's all.''

<HEAD>Junta Leader Urges Rebels to Agree to Third Round of Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's military leader called on
southern rebels Monday to agree to a third round of peace talks
toward ending almost seven years of civil war.
   Adressing a rally marking the 34th anniversary of Sudan's
independence attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan el-Bashir said he hopes 1990 will be a year of peace.
   ``I call anew on the (rebel) movement to sit at the negotiating
table for a third time to reach a peace forula accepted by all,''
el-Bashir told the crowd in Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city across
the Nile River.
   ``The revolution is determined to make this year a year of peace
in Sudan and to make the last decade in the century an era of
reform and development by uniting the national efforts.''
   Rebel leader John Garang said on clandestine rebel radio that
his forces would continue to resist Sudan's ``dictatorial,
oppressive and repressive'' military government.
   Representatives of el-Beshir, who led a coup that overthrew
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian government on June 30,
have held two rounds of talks with the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   The latter one was in Nairobi in November, mediated by former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Rebel leaders and Carter said the
November talks collapsed because of conflicting points of view
between the two sides and that no date was mentioned for resuming
them.
   But spokesmen for the government have said that while some
issues were disputed, positions acceptable to both sides were found
for others. The government officials said the two sides agreed to
meet again.
   On a recent tour of southern Africa, officials of the rebel
movement urged the government to repeal Islamic law, lift the state
of emergency, announce a cease-fire and abrogate military pacts
with other countries.
   Garang, in his radio broadcast that was monitored in Kenya, also
accused el-Bashir of insincerity in peace talks.
   ``Our experience in the talks ... confirmed that the junta does
not have any program for peace and at the same time has rejected
our proposals to form a broad-based government,'' said Garang.
   Garang, a former army colonel who formed the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army in 1983, said his forces would ``continue
resisting the junta since it is imposing itself and its dictatorial
policy on our masses.''
   In his comments marking the 34th anniversary of Sudan's
independence as well as the new year, Garang called on all
opposition movements in Sudan to unite ``in their struggle against
this dictatorial, oppressive and repressive regime.''
   The rebels have been fighting Sudan's Moslem-dominated
government for greater autonomy and economic reforms for the
country's predominantly Christian and African south.
   The rebels said no date was mentioned for resuming the
negotiations. However, government representatives said the talks
ended with both sides agreeing to meet again.

<HEAD>New Year Brings Higher Payroll Taxes, Bigger Social Security
Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new year is bringing higher payroll taxes
for workers and bigger checks for retirees as a long-scheduled
Social Security tax increase kicks in and a cost-of-living
adjustment boosts retirement benefits.
   The payroll tax is rising to 7.65 percent from 7.51 percent in
1989, meaning employees will pay $765 to Social Security for each
$10,000 of earnings subject to the tax, $14 more than last year.
Employers pay an equal amount for each worker.
   The increase has been in the cards since 1977, when Congress
approved a plan to help keep the giant retirement program on sound
financial footing that included the tax jump in 1990.
   Congress subsequently enacted a bailout package in 1983 that
boosted the payroll tax from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent in 1988,
without changing the 7.65 rate that already was planned for 1990.
   The new year also means workers will start paying Social
Security taxes on a bigger share of their earnings. The payroll tax
applies to income of up to $51,300 in 1990, an increase from
$48,000 in 1989.
   The combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of Social Security taxes
deducted will jump by $320 to $3,924 for a worker who earns $51,300
or more.
   Social Security taxes also are going up for the self-employed,
who will pay 15.30 percent in 1990 _ the combined employee-employer
tax rate.
   The tax rate on the self-employed technically was 15.02 percent
in 1989, but they got a 2 percent tax credit that automatically
reduced the amount paid to 13.02 percent. In 1990, they lose the
tax credit, but for the first time they will be able to deduct half
their Social Security taxes as a business expense. The same $51,300
wage base applies.
   The wage base has gone up every year since 1971, with the latest
increase affecting about 10.4 million workers and self-employed
individuals who have earnings over last year's maximum.
   While 130 million workers and self-employed people will be
paying more into Social Security in 1990, 38.9 million Social
Security beneficiaries will start drawing bigger monthly benefit
checks.
   Checks delivered on Jan. 3 will include a 4.7 percent benefit
increase, the biggest boost in 7{ years. The cost-of-living
adjustment is designed to offset the effects of inflation in the
past year.
   The increase promises an extra $25 a month for the average
retired worker, who in 1989 received $541 a month. The maximum
monthly benefit for a worker retiring at age 65 in 1990 will be
$975, up $76 from the comparable figure for 1989.
   The 4.7 percent benefit increase also applies to 4.5 million
recipients of Supplemental Security Income, which provides a
minimum income floor for poor people who are aged, blind or
disabled. Maximum SSI benefits will rise to $386 for an individual
and $579 for a couple in 1990, up from $368 and $553, respectively,
in 1989.
   Since 1975, Social Security benefits have risen automatically
each year along with advances in the Consumer Price Index, except
for six months in 1983 that were skipped to help Social Security
avert a financial crisis. In earlier years, benefits were increased
sporadically by Congress, often in election years.
   The 1990 increase in the payroll tax rate will be the 21st. The
payroll tax was 1 percent of income up to $3,000 when Social
Security started in 1937. It stayed there until 1950 and has risen
gradually since then.
   In addition to financing Social Security retirement benefits,
the payroll tax also finances survivors and disability coverage and
most of Medicare.
   The Social Security Administration maintains that the tax
increase is needed to help the government build up the reserves
that will be needed to help pay retirement benefits early in the
next century.
   Social Security's trust funds grew by $59 billion in fiscal 1989
to $169 billion, and are projected to peak at $11.8 trillion in
2030, when the reserves will be drawn down as the baby boom
generation retires.
   The higher taxes being levied now to pay Social Security
benefits later don't sit well with everyone, including the National
Federation of Independent Business, which says the 1990 tax
increase should be repealed.
   ``The money siphoned away by this tax increase could be used for
business growth and job creation,'' said NFIB president John Sloan.
``Instead it will go to the trust fund where it can only tempt
politicians looking for an easy way to reduce the deficit or fund
another pet project.''
   The federation admits Congress is unlikely to roll back the tax,
but is vowing to make it an issue on Capitol Hill.

<HEAD>Police Hope More Officers, Citizen Involvement Will Slow Murder
Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two years of soaring homicide
statistics, District of Columbia police hope a combination of more
officers and increased community involvement will curb the carnage
in the nation's capital.
   ``We're sort of optimistic, and we think we have the key
ingredients to turn this thing around,'' said police spokesman Lt.
Reginald Smith. ``We're beginning to realize more community
support, and we need a lot of that if we are going to avoid setting
another murder record.''
   Washington became known as the murder capital of America after
two consecutive years of record-setting homicides. The city of
650,000 ended 1989 with an unofficial total of 438 killings, a
record that topped the previous high of 369 recorded in 1988.
   Police have blamed drugs, particularly crack cocaine, for more
than 60 percent of these deaths.
   ``We still see drugs as a big problem, but people in the
community are beginning to be fed up and are patrolling their
neighborhoods, serving as the eyes and ears we need,'' Smith said
in a recent interview. ``We can't be everywhere, and we need these
people to stand up.''
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, upon taking office last August,
immediately called upon citizens to get involved by alerting police
to the whereabouts of murder suspects or when they witness a crime.
   While Smith said community patrols are beginning to work, police
are also pinning their hopes on the 1,000 extra officers Congress
and the city have agreed to provide.
   ``When we get those officers out on the street, no doubt they
will have an impact,'' Smith said. ``We will increase our presence
in neighborhoods where we are already active and improve coverage
elsewhere.''
   The city has an authorized strength of 4,055 officers, but the
new hires will increase the police force to almost 5,100 officers.
   Smith said about 250 new hires are enrolled in the department's
six-month training program, while a nationwide recruiting drive is
being conducted to find the rest.
   The first new officers should hit the streets by early spring,
Smith said.
   The federal government is footing the bill for 700 new officers
_ and will pay their salaries and benefits for the next five years
_ while the city has included money in its budget to hire 300 extra
police.
   The city also will attempt to rehire retired officers to handle
desk work in an effort to get younger officers out into the
community.
   But police have already learned that more arrests won't solve
the crime problem. More than 46,000 people have been arrested in an
anti-drug sweep that began in 1987, but drug sales continue. The
same has been true for killings.
   ``We're not going to be naive and say this thing is going to go
away overnight,'' Smith said. ``It will take time to turn this
around, and really, some sort of fundamental change in attitude ...
where there is a respect for life.''

   ``Outstate Michigan'' and
``political strongman'' won thumbs down honors as annoying phrases
to avoid for the new year.
   The 1990 Dishonor List of Words includes more than 60 phrases
and words compiled throughout 1989, said researchers at Lake
Superior State University.
   ``Outstate Michigan'' got on the nerves of many state residents.
   ``This seemingly innocuous word grates on my sensibilities like
fingernails across a blackboard ... the implication being that
Detroit is Michigan and the rest of the Michigan land mass is out
of the state,'' wrote Yvonne Carlson of Ludington.
   ``Political strongman'' was irritating to Bill Ziegler of Troy.
   ``This should be nipped in the bud before some university
develops a new degree combining political science with physical
education and weight training,'' Ziegler said.
   Other phrases that made the list included:
   _Ethics Bill. ``Congressional expression for `pay raise,'''
wrote Jerry Jones of Cincinnati.
   _Drug Czar. ``How about anti-drug czar,'' wrote Ruth Hood of
Warren.
   _Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience. ``The alternative is a
bit grisly,'' Hood also wrote.
   _Rush Hour. ``Why rush? The traffic is barely moving,'' wrote
Dave Summers of Holly.
   _All Except. ``Entirety can't have a minus,'' wrote Ben Szczesny
of Muskegon.
   _Minor Emergency Clinic. ``Either something is an emergency, or
it isn't,'' wrote Carol McLendon of Fort Worth, Texas.

   Restoration of the state Capitol is going
on nicely, although there's evidence the father of Michigan may be
overshadowing the father of our country.
   An X-ray of a 6-foot-by-9-foot painting of Lewis Cass showed
another layer under the Cass painting.
   ``There is a whitish area around Cass' head,'' said Maria
Quinlan Leiby, curator of collections at the Michigan Historical
Museum. ``(It) tends to look like the white hair of George
Washington.''
   That was the first clue. Then researchers found that a portrait
of Washington disappeared after World War II from the Capitol's
inventory of artwork.
   A discrepancy in the portrait of Cass was first spotted a year
ago by William Seale, a Virginia historian who has written a book
on state capitols and is a specialist in Victorian furnishings.
   Cass governed the Michigan territory from 1813-31 and is
credited with preparing Michigan for statehood. He later became a
senator and was the Democratic candidate for president in 1848.
   ``Here is Lewis Cass in the setting of George Washington,''
Seale said after viewing the portrait. He said he recognized the
background as being from the White House, as well as noticing Cass'
old-fashioned pose.
   The X-ray exam was a routine part of the Capitol restoration,
and the painting was sent in July to the Detroit Institute of Arts
for cleaning and repairs.
   ``There has definitely been a change in the design around the
head, as there is a buildup of lead-white paint,'' said Alfred
Ackerman, a laboratory painting conservator. ``There also appears
to be more hair around the head, as well as possible changes in the
location of the eyes and nose.''
   Leiby doesn't think the work was done over a portrait of
Washington, preferring to think the overpainting was done to
improve a bad likeness of Cass. She said Cass' dress and what
Washington wore also don't jibe.
   The work is unsigned, and both artists who are listed by the
state to have done Cass portraits are dead.
   The art institute is to return the portrait this month to the
Senate, mystery unsolved.

   Thousands of Soviet citizens rallied over the
weekend to call for the disbanding of the Communist Party and to
complain about worsening shortages of food and vodka, activists and
media reported Monday.
   In the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, an activist said 3,000 to
4,000 people demonstrated Sunday to demand an end to the Communist
Party, which has reigned over the Soviet Union since 1917, and
until Friday was the only legal political party in the vast nation.
   Only Lithuania has legalized alternative political parties. The
tiny Baltic republic registered the first non-Communist party on
Friday.
   In Sverdlovsk in central Russia, citizens who have suffered
extreme shortages of food and consumer goods in silence finally
demanded action _ and got it, according to the newspaper Rabochaya
Tribuna. Communist Party officials dissolved an unhappy`crowd by
flooding local stores with the missing vodka, prompting the
newspaper to wonder where it had been all along.
   The anti-Communist rally in Azerbaijan was spawned by the
downfall of the Communist Party in Romania and the execution of its
leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, according to local activist Aidy
Amirbekov.
   Soviet media thoroughly covered the revolution in Romania, and
the national television news editorialized in its coverage that
Ceausescu had diverted food and other resources from his people so
he could live in style.
   The Sverdlovsk demonstration arose when a crowd of citizens,
upset because there was no vodka to be found in the stores even
with their new vodka ration coupons, gathered downtown and halted
city transport Friday, Rabochaya Tribuna said.
   Regional Communist Party officials went out to soothe them, and
simultaneously flooded the local stores with supplies of vodka.
   Much of the crowd dissolved when the would-be shoppers rushed
off to buy the vodka, the newspaper said. But some remained behind
to complain, because Sverdlovsk residents have been unable to turn
their ration coupons into meat, sugar, butter and other food
products, Rabochaya Tribuna said.
   Rationing varies from city to city in the Soviet Union. In
Moscow, only sugar is rationed but many items have become
impossible to find.
   Sverdlovsk officials claimed the vodka shortage resulted from
the fact that half the city's monthly supply had already been sold
when the ration coupons were introduced in mid-December. But the
newspaper said events proved the vodka was not sold out.
   ``When people become indignant over standing in line for hours
with thousands of others, vodka immediately appeared on the shelves
of many stores,'' the newspaper concluded, leaving readers to
wonder where it had been hiding.
   Soviet newspapers often repeat citizen complaints that
``bureaucrats'' are sabotaging reforms by stealing and hiding
hard-to-find items. They rarely produce any evidence.

   Feisty Zsa Zsa Gabor, whose
police-slapping trial earned her negative publicity and jail time,
was soundly booed by spectators Monday when she rode her horse in
the Tournament of Roses Parade.
   ``Go to jail, you floozy,'' some in the crowd screamed when she
rode by on her Tennessee walking horse, Silver Fox.
   Miss Gabor was convicted and sentenced to jail for slapping a
Beverly Hills policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce.
   ``My mother and my sister Eva didn't want me to ride, but what
the hell,'' Miss Gabor said. ``A couple of people will hate me, but
I love America. I'm proud to be an American citizen.''
   Her face was flushed and she appeared startled by the audience
reaction to her appearance in the parade.
   The 72-year-old Hungarian-born actress had predicted that she'd
be greeted with love and enthusiasm.
   ``They'll love me, you'll be surprised,'' Miss Gabor said
Sunday. ``I got 10,000 cards from people who said I was right.''
   Miss Gabor did concede, however, that the negative publicity of
the trial caused her to have ``third and fourth thoughts'' about
riding with the Belles and Beaus of the 1800s equestrian unit.
   ``I was afraid someone might boo (and scare) my horse. He's
untouchable. If anyone boos, I'd boo back,'' Miss Gabor said. But
no one saw her boo back.
   Miss Gabor was convicted last year of battery on a peace
officer, driving without a valid license and driving with an open
container of alcohol in her Rolls-Royce.
   Miss Gabor, who is appealing the conviction, said she slapped
the officer because he roughed her up during a traffic stop. She
was sentenced to three days in jail, log 120 hours of community
service and pay a $12,837 fine.

   Actor Morgan Freeman says despite his formal
theatrical education, he relies on his instincts in front of the
camera.
   He took acting classes at the start of his career and recently
read writings by acting teacher Constantin Stanislavsky, ``but that
business of peeling away layers of skin was too murky and deep for
me,'' Freeman said in an interview published in the Jan. 8 edition
of Time magazine.
   ``I haven't found that I've had to do that in any intellectual

   A New Year's Eve peace gathering drew Ron
Kovic, whose story is told in the film ``Born on the Fourth of
July.''
   Kovic, a disabled Vietnam veteran known for his anti-war
activism, was in Santa Monica to help local peace advocate Jerry
Rubin break a protest fast with ice cream.
   Rubin's Alliance for Survival group sponsors the annual event at
the Church in Ocean Park and he fasts several times a year to
protest such issues as TV violence, environmental destruction and
U.S. involvement in Central America.
   ``Ron inspired me to get more active in the peace movement, so

to the Yippie leader. ``His movie is truly positive and shows what
good can happen from a single source.''
   Kovic and filmmaker Oliver Stone created the film that stars Tom
Cruise.
   After the fast-breaking ceremony, Rubin tossed a large globe
into a crowd of about 300 people. ``It gives everyone a chance to
hug the planet Earth,'' he said.

   The Dalai Lama, whose Tibetan homeland
is ruled by China, said in a New Year's Day message he hoped the
democracy sweeping across Eastern Europe will spread to Beijing.
   ``Rather than resist and go against such developments, I urge
the Chinese leadership to accept the reality of existing situations
and the legitimate desires of the people,'' the Tibetan spiritual
and temporal leader said in a statement issued Monday by his New
Delhi office.
   The Dalai Lama, whose non-violent campaign for Tibetan freedom
won his the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has lived in exile in India
since fleeing Tibet in 1959.

   Copies of Securitate files show with
chilling clarity how a paranoid state spied on its citizens with
telephone taps, mail intercepts, photographic surveillance and paid
informants.
   The copies, obtained by The Associated Press, record 12 years in
the life of Doru Pavaloaie, 48, an economist for a bus company who
was denounced by a schoolmate because he wanted to leave the
country.
   The documents detail a pervasive system of internal espionage by
the security agents of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who
was ousted and executed by the December revolution that ended 24
years of his rule.
   Pavaloaie's file began on July 13, 1977, after his chance
encounter on the streets with an old classmate, a man with whom he
felt comfortable talking about his wish to move abroad, the lack of
freedom in Romania and his demand that ``Ceausescu must give us
food.''
   The schoolmate, however, was a paid informant codenamed Geamparu
who denounced Pavaloaie in a document that also made allegations
about the premarital sexual activity of Pavaloaie's first wife and
referred to the wealth of her parents and her relatives in West
Germany.
   Geamparu identifies himself in the document as a ``former school
colleague'' of Pavaloaie.
   ``Doru Pavaloaie does not have a job and lives like a parasite.
Since the very beginning of the marriage both of them have wanted
to leave the country and go to Germany to his wife's relatives,''
he wrote at a safehouse known only by the codename Rosa.
   Pavaloaie, in a telephone interview from his home in Focsani,
120 miles north of Bucharest, said he later began to suspect his
old friend was an informer.
   ``I suspected him because the security services`during
interrogations used some of my words when I talked with Geamparu,''
said Pavaloaie.
   Early on the morning of Dec. 22, just hours after Ceausescu was
overthrown, Pavaloaie was among those who occupied the security
forces headquarters in Focsani.
   Beneath the headquarters, the revolutionaries found an
underground bunker with electronic eavesdropping devices, arms and
ammunition, and boxes of security files stacked nearly to the
ceiling.
   Pavaloaie said there were files on roughly half the adult male
population of the city of 100,000 people.
   One of them was on Pavaloaie himself, and he took it home to
have the documents photographed by free-lance journalist Livia
Axente, who traveled to Bucharest to make the copies available to
The AP Monday at Pavaloaie's request.
   ``I wanted to give my name to American journalists in case
something happens to me,'' Pavaloaie said.
   He said he was frightened because army officers came to his
house on Sunday, told him he could make copies if he wanted to, but
that he had to return the file to the security headquarters.
   Inside his file, which contained three ledgers as thick as a
fist, he found reports from eight informers, including Geamparu,
the record of telephone taps, copies of intercepted letters
addressed to him, and photographs of himself taken clandestinely.
   Over the years, Pavaloaie said he began to believe he was under
surveillance.
   ``I felt something was happening with my phone lines and when I
walked down the street I felt like somebody was watching me. But I
couldn't imagine it was really happening,'' he said.
   Copies of his file include documents from the Interior
Ministry's Department of State Security seeking authorization for
telephone taps.
   One of those, approved by a Col. P. Stoica, covered the period
May 23, 1979, to Nov. 23, 1979.
   It said state security wanted to know the names and phone
numbers of the people he contacted and if ``there are any
discussions with characters hostile to (Communist) Party policy or
our state policy.''
   It also sought to find ``the intentions of the target to
illegally leave the country.''
   Pavaloaie has been married to his second wife for a year and a
half, and they had a 5-month-old boy. He said eight months ago he
applied to emigrate to Israel with his Jewish wife, who has
relatives in Israel.
   He noted that it was the first time he had ever officially asked
to leave Romania, a desire he previously had confided only to close
friends.
   He said Geamparu was one of those friends, a man he had known
since his schooldays and who made a living singing at parties and
weddings, and listening to the drunken talk of the partygoers.
   Inside his file, Pavaloaie said he found a document that
identified Geamparu by his real name. But he said the document was
not copied in the rush to photograph them for American journalists
before being returned to security headquarters.
   The copies clearly showed the letterheads of the Department of
State Security or the local security forces.
   The photographs of the ledgers showed them clearly marked
``Socialist Republic of Romania, Internal Affairs Ministry,
Information File for Doru Pavaloaie'' with the number of the file,
the volume number and the kind of information it contained.
   The files outline in detail how the web of surveillance spread
from the original target to all his friends and acquaintances.
   They show the paranoia of a state that felt a need to listen to
private telephone calls, read the mail of its citizens, follow
then, photograph them, investigate them, interrogate them and
recruit their friends as informers.
   The story of Pavaloaie also points to the twists in
revolutionary Romania.
   Axente said Geamparu is a man who ``really helped'' the
revolution, a man who used the amplifier he uses to sing at parties
to rally the people on Dec. 22.
   So far, said Axente, nobody has confronted Geamparu about his
past as an informer. He said that people are too afraid, too
uncertain about the political climate to denounce Geamparu,
especially after the army ordered the return of the file.
   The copies given to the AP included, among other things,
transcripts from telephone monitoring, Geamparu's denouncing of
Pavaloaie, photocopies of intercepted letters and documents seeking
authorization to tap his phone.
   The dates on the documents stretch from 1977 up to the present.
   Pavaloaie said he wanted to make the documents public as a way
both to protect himself and to fight against the system that had so
brutally violated his privacy.
   ``I saw all those young children killed by Ceausescu. They were
only children and we are older men and we must fight to final
victory,'' Pavaloaie said.

<HEAD>Price Increases Take Effect With New Year in Radical Economic Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bus fares and gasoline doubled and
electricity quadrupled in price Monday under a radical plan by the
non-Communist government to transform Poland's centrally planned
economy to capitalism.
   Poles' fears of looming price increases were confirmed Monday,
and Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledged hardships in
coming months but stressed the increases were needed to halt
Poland's 900 percent inflation to end its economic decline.
   ``There are no solutions devoid of risk,'' the official news
agency PAP quoted him as saying. ``Above all, I would like to
stress that despite the dangers and challenges, we stand before a
unique chance and it depends on us how we take advantage of it.''
   The far-reaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally
directed economy run by the Communists during their four-decade
rule. But there is concern that the economic shock will be too much
for Poles, who earn an average monthly wage of 350,000 zlotys ($37).
   ``We're never going to be able to make it. People aren't going
to be able to pay these prices,'' said one cabbie at a Warsaw gas
station, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The price increases come the same day as an earlier announced 38
percent devaluation in the currency to the dollar took effect. The
devaluation was intended to close the gap between the official rate
and black market rate. The government also plans to make the zloty
convertible to other currencies.
   The price of coal, a major source of heat in Polish homes,
officially increased by 600 percent, the cost of electricity by 400
percent and the price of heating gas by 400 percent.
   Rail and intercity bus passengers found that the price of
tickets had gone up an average of 250 percent, while the price of
municipal bus tickets doubled.
   Most gas stations were shut for the New Year's holiday, but
drivers who needed to fill their tanks learned that the price of
regular gasoline had doubled from 1,200 zlotys a liter (48 cents a
gallon) to 2,400 zlotys a liter (96 cents a gallon).
   The price raises form part of a radical economic program backed
by the Solidarity-led government that was passed by Parliament last
week. Included in the program is a law regulating salary increases.
   Balcerowicz, whose plan is supported by the World Bank, the
European Economic Community and major Western governments, told PAP
that the difficult times coming were unavoidable but delays in
applying the plan would hurt Poles even further in the long run.
   ``In the next few months we expect limitations on income, but
without this it is impossible to check inflation,'' Balcerowicz
said.
   Until now, wages have been pegged to inflation, but enterprises
will have less money to pay workers under reduced state subsidies.
   Balcerowicz said that bankruptcies would occur as a result of
the new policies, but that the move to limit wage increases might
reduce the scale of closures.
   In August, Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became prime
minister, the first non-Communist head of a government in Eastern
Europe. Since then, democratic reforms have swept the East bloc,
and non-Communists have been installed as presidents in
Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

<HEAD>Three Baltic States Start Economic Independence Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania started their much-debated economic independence programs
Monday, taking control of factories and other elements of their
economies from bureaucrats in Moscow.
   Estonia underscored the potential of the reform by kicking off a
contest to design its new currency, the krona.
   The newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna said the krona will be
introduced next year and planners tentatively expect it to be fixed
to the ruble at a one-to-one rate for interregional trade.
   But they plan for the krona to float against the ruble for
tourist purposes, the newspaper said.
   Details of the economic independence plans were still being
hammered out at the last minute, as officials of the republics and
the national government in Moscow argued which powers would be
decentralized.
   The Baltics, with their more recent experience with capitalism
than the rest of the Soviet Union, favor much more drastic economic
reforms than Moscow, including legalization of private property.
   The three republics were independent nations between the two
world wars, until they were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New powers to outlaw religious
discrimination in Northern Ireland came into force Monday.
   Unemployment among the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland is
twice as high as for the Protestant majority.
   Under the new laws, a Fair Employment Commission will
investigate and monitor the actions of employers and force them to
adopt fair employment practices.
   Employers must register the religious make-up of their workforce
with the commission and where it is out of balance with the
population in the area, they will be ordered to take action to
redress the imbalance.
   Where voluntary action towards equality fails, the commission
can back its orders with a variety of actions supervised by a Fair
Employment Tribunal.
   Anyone who is the victim of religious discrimination can be
awarded up to $48,000. Employers who discriminate face sanctions
that include being barred from government contracts, grants or
loans.

   Stinging Portuguese men-of-war are rubbing tourists
the wrong way on the beaches of southeastern Florida.
   Hundreds of beachgoers have been stung by the pink-and-blue
jellyfish-like creatures in recent days from Palm Beach south to
Miami Beach and Key Biscayne.
   ``I had 20 people stung right in front of me,'' Miami Beach
lifeguard Mike Hoover said Sunday.
   ``We're getting invaded here,'' said Hollywood lifeguard Louis
DeSimone.
   Bruce Koski of the Fort Lauderdale Beach Patrol said the stings,
which sometimes are compared to an electric shock, were to be
expected.
   ``It's the time of year for the man-of-war, and they have a very
painful sting,'' he said. The stings are treated on the beach with
salves.
   People are stung when they unknowingly step on men-of-war
tentacles while walking along the shore or when they brush against
them while swimming.
   On Sunday alone, 350 bathers at Hollywood, 330 in Fort
Lauderdale and nearly 300 on Palm Beach-area beaches reported
stings.
   Seasonal southeasterly winds, the same that bring balmy breezes
in from tropical seas to the south, are to blame, causing
congregations of jellyfish along lee shores.
   The balloon-like body of a man-of-war floats on the surface and
is easy to see but the tentacles, sometimes 25 or 30 feet long,
waft in the current and are difficult to avoid. When caught in the
surf, the creatures are often broken apart, but their toxins remain
active for hours even after being washed up on the sand.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Leaders Exchange New Year's Hopes for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Monday hailed the superpowers' moves to thaw the Cold War and
exchanged hopes that they can work even closer to ensure a century
of peace.
   In a New Year's message to the Soviet people, Bush said, ``There
are no maps to lead us where we are going, to this new world of our
own making.
   ``As the world looks back to nine decades of war, of strife, of
suspicion, let us also look forward _ to a new century, and a new
millennium, of peace, freedom and prosperity,'' Bush said.
   In a corresponding message to the United States, Gorbachev said
he and Bush have agreed ``to get away from the Cold War and to
abandon the Cold War instruments as well, so that 1990 and
subsequent years could open up a period of genuine cooperation
before us.''
   The Soviet leader proposed further cooperation in the 1990s to
rid ``the world of fears and mistrust, of unnecessary weapons, of
outdated political concepts and military doctrines, and artificial
barriers between people and states.
   ``The year 1990 could become a genuine turning point in the
efforts to limit and reduce arms. We, on our part, shall do
everything for that.''
   Soviet television broadcast Gorbachev's greetings to the
American people at 7 p.m. Moscow time and followed it with Bush's
greetings to the Soviets. Both greetings, a New Year's tradition
began by Gorbachev and former President Reagan, were broadcast at
11 a.m. EST on Cable News Network.
   Bush reiterated that the United States, as well as NATO allies,
``seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes under way'' in
Eastern Europe.
   ``We will work together to reduce barriers to trade, investment
and the free movement of goods and ideas. In these ways, and as
your economic reforms take place, the entry of the Soviet Union
into the global market can be advanced,'' said Bush, who is
vacationing in Texas but who taped the message in Washington before
he left.
   Neither of the two leaders, who met in December in Malta,
directly criticized the other, but Gorbachev referred to
``hesitations, wait-and-see attitudes, doubts and suspicions''
toward cooperation.
   ``The entire world proceeds ahead. It wants happiness, freedom
and prosperity. And it would be naive, senseless and dangerous to
try to thwart this aspiration for a better future.''
   Bush referred to ``a respect for human rights and the sharing of
democratic values'' and praised Andrei D. Sakharov, the human
rights activist who died last month during a campaign to end
Communist supremacy in the Soviet Union.
   ``Your own Leo Tolstoy said that if our hearts are empty, no law
or political reform can fill them,'' Bush said. ``These values ...
belong to all men and women, through all time, and in all places.''

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans began the New Year on Monday
with the task of cleaning streets littered by fireworks and broken
glass and repairing an economy sapped by four decades of Communist
mismanagement.
   The first year of the 1990s will see the first free elections in
East Germany's 40-year history, but it will also determine whether
it remains independent and sovereign or is merged with the wealthy
West German state.
   ``This is going to be a very full and important year,'' said
Baerbel Richter, who strolled through the debris-strewn streets of
East Berlin with her 5-year-old grandson, Franciskus. ``We have to
be careful how we go about it.''
   Freedom to travel has whetted some East Germans' appetites for
the more comfortable lifestyles taken for granted in the West,
while others have resolved to protect the separate statehood of
East Germany against what they see as an attempt by Bonn to buy
them out.
   Debts and declining productivity may worsen if an exodus to the
West continues to drain East Germany of its skilled workers and
hope for the future.
   At least 320,000 East Germans relocated to West Germany in 1989,
undermining the economy of the already labor-short socialist state
of more than 16 million people.
   Reforms likely to devalue East Germany's currency while boosting
the price of many basic food and consumer items are under
consideration as the interim government moves cautiously to
introduce market principles into the planned economy.
   In his New Year's message, Premier Hans Modrow appealed for
broader financial support from West Germany, but continued to
resist formal unification that could subjugate his nation to its
capitalist neighbor.
   ``The larger our economic problems, the worse the climate will
be for the elections,'' Modrow warned.
   East Germany's Communist Party will compete with new citizens'
movements and political parties in the May 6 balloting for
parliamentary seats and a role in the national government.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel planned a trip to East
Germany on Tuesday, his first official visit to a foreign country
since being named head of state Friday.
   In contrast with the unbridled overnight revelry, the East
German capital was nearly deserted during the short daylight on
Monay that was made drearier by a snowfall scattered by sharp gusts
of wind.
   The ADN news agency reported that 5.2 million Germans crossed
the inter-German border over the holiday weekend, including 3.7
million between the two sides of divided Berlin.
   Crumpled paper streamers, charred sparklers and fireworks
casings paved the streets and sidewalks of central East Berlin,
where 500,000 had gathered the night before to ring in the new year.
   At least 135 people were injured and one killed during the
raucous celebration when a tower of scaffolding near the
Brandenburg Gate fell under the weight of revelers seeking higher
vantage points from which to survey the scene along the Berlin Wall.
   Police from both East Berlin and West Berlin reported 77 people
were taken to hospitals and dozens of others were treated at the
scene.

   The '90s rolled in Monday to a welcome of parades, football
games, sales, skiing and, in a few cases, hangovers from the
wretched excesses of New Year's Eve.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor, on horseback, got booed, as did Sen. John Glenn.
Philadelphia's Mummers had cold feet and stayed home.
   The birth of twin girls ushered in the new decade in Boston at
Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``The nurses told me they were born
right straight up at midnight,'' hospital spokeswoman Louise Homer
said Monday. Jennifer and Jessica Rios, daughters of Karen Pizarro,
were in neonatal intensive care Monday and ``doing fine,'' Homer
said.
   President Bush invited the people of the Soviet Union in a New
Year's video message to ``look forward to a new century, and a new
millennium, of peace, freedom and prosperity.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in his message to the
United States: ``The 1990s may become a decade when freedom,
democracy and equality will begin to be established on a global
scale and in an increasingly irreversible way.''
   An estimated 1 million people lined curbs and sidewalks in
Pasadena, Calif., to watch the 101st Tournament of Roses Parade on
a picture-perfect, sunny, balmy day.
   ``It's a real circus,'' said Ferris Reid of Aurora, Ill., of the
crowds tht waited overnight. ``But I don't think I'm crazy being
here all night. Being crazy was staying back in Illinois in the
winter.''
   ``It was 70 below zero with the wind chill when I left Iowa,''
said Elise Wise, 80, of Newton, Iowa. It was near 50 degrees at
parade time.
   Sixty floats, 22 bands and 275 equestrians were led by grand
marshal Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the first U.S. astronaut to orbit
the Earth.
   In addition to Mickey Mouse and Elvis _ the flowery head of the
King of Rock 'n' Roll adorned Mississippi's float _ the attractions
at the Rose Parade included Zsa Zsa riding her Tennessee walking
horse.
   The appearance of the convicted police-slapper angered many
spectators, who booed loudly as she rode by, some screaming, ``Go
to jail, you floozy.''
   ``A couple of people will hate me, but I love America. I'm proud
to be an American citizen,'' she said.
   Occasional boos also greeted Glenn, one of five U.S. senators
who received a total of $1.3 million from Charles H. Keating Jr.
and met with regulators on behalf of his Lincoln Savings and Loan,
whose failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
   The Rose parade spectators also booed a brief demonstration by
AIDS activists who carried a banner reading ``Emergency. Stop the
parade. 70,000 Dead of AIDS.'' The group sat in the road, briefly
halting the parade.
   In Philadelphia, the annual New Year's Day Mummers Parade was
postponed until Jan. 6 because of gusting wind and a threat of snow.
   There was more than a threat of snow a little farther north.
Revelers from Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota filled ski resorts
on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, taking advantage of the 150-plus
inches of snow that has fallen so far this season.
   Elsewhere in Michigan, Detroit police said many residents
apparently heeded pleas to abandon the traditional midnight blast
of gunfire to ring in the new year. No injuries were reported.
   ``It was nice and quiet,'' said Officer John Leavens. ``I don't
know what it is, I'm just glad to see it.''
   Traditions die harder elsewhere.
   In Chicago, the blare of New Year's Eve party horns and bark of
champagne corks were punctuated by shots fired into the air. Police
shot and killed a man shortly after midnight after he pointed a gun
in their direction.
   ``It's like combat,'' said Capt. James Phelan. ``It really
sounds like a battle zone, with shots being fired all over the
place.''
   In Los Angeles, gunfire could be heard from all compass points
downtown after the stroke of midnight. ``We're used to it. It
sounds like a shooting gallery,'' said Sgt. T. Brown. ``The dopes
won't learn unless they get hit themselves.''
   Falling bullets have struck dozens of people in recent years, as
well as causing damage to cars and property. City police routinely
ground their squadron of helicopters during the height of the
shooting.
   And someone always has to be different.
   People attending one Chicago nightclub chose not recognize the
birth of a new decade.
   Hundreds waited in lines half a block long to get into Berlin
nightclub's ``Anti-New Year's'' bash. Doormen put black tape over
patrons' watches and DJs played music through midnight with no
acknowledgement of the New Year.
   And members of the L Street Brownies, a South Boston sports
club, held the 86th observance of their New Year's ritual _ a dip
into the frigid water of Boston Harbor.
   ``The yuppies go to Florida for the winter. We stay here for the
crystal clear waters of Boston Harbor,'' said member Peter
Jurzynski, 38. ``It's good for New Year's hangovers as well.''

   Senior journalists at the Jerusalem Post
resigned Monday after a long-simmering dispute with the publisher.
   Ten editors and reporters, including the managing editor, David
Landau, sent their letters of resignation to Canadian owner David
Radler.
   Their resignations came one week after the departure of the top
editor, Erwin Frenkel. Frenkel said he quit because his editorial
authority had been undermined by the publisher, Yehuda Levy.
   The paper's editorial staff filed notice of a labor dispute
Thursday, which will allow them to take action, including a strike
or work slowdown, after a two-week waiting period. They are
demanding Levy's removal.
   The Post is Israel's only English-language daily. It also
publishes a weekly international edition.
   In their letter to Radler, the journalists said they had no
choice but to resign because of ``an ever-increasing erosion of
editorial independence accompanied by an assault on the editorial
line which the paper has embodied since its establishment in 1932.''
   Levy denied accusations by some of the paper's journalists that
he is moving the Post in a right-wing direction.
   ``I have not tried or attempted to change the line of the paper,
and I don't think I have shown any indication to do so in the
future. ... So if anyone claims this is the reason for the crisis,
he is lying, knowing that he is lying,'' Levy said.
   Levy was appointed president and publisher in July by Radler,
chairman of the board of Hollinger Inc., a Canadian newspaper
group. Hollinger Inc. bought a controlling interest in the Post in
April.
   The wave of resignations began Nov. 30 with the departure of the
head editor, Ari Rath, after persistent disagreements with Levy.
   The editorial staff wants Radler to fire Levy and ask Frenkel to
withdraw his resignation once Levy is replaced.

<HEAD>Two People Killed in New Year Celebrations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Lebanese greeted the New
Year on Monday in the traditional fashion of firing machine guns
and tossing grenades, and police said two people were killed and 10
were wounded.
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias, meanwhile, battled for a 10th day
for control of south Lebanon's al-Tuffah region. Police said eight
people were killed and 13 wounded in the clashes Sunday and Monday.
   In Beirut, most of the New Year casualties occurred in the
Christian sector.
   The victims were mostly hit by stray bullets and grenade
shrapnel. Others were hurt in car crashes as panicky motorists
bumped into each other as a result of the shooting.
   At least 40 house robberies were reported during the
dusk-to-dawn celebrations and fireworks started several house fires
in the Moslem and Christian sectors. Police estimated the damage at
$40,000.
   Shooting guns, supposedly in the air, has been a common way of
expressing joy and grief in Lebanon since the 1975 outbreak of the
civil war between Christians and Moslems.
   The fighting in south Lebanon pitted fighters of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, against the pro-Syrian
Amal, Arabic for hope. They used artillery and tank fire.
   The clashes raised the overall toll to 59 dead and 216 wounded
since the fighting for control of the region erupted Dec. 23.
   The two factions have been vying for mastery of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for more than two
years.
   By police count, the overall toll in the intermittent power
struggle since May 1987 stands at 630 killed and 1,795 wounded.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel on Monday
denounced the grim economic and ecological wounds left by 41 years
of Communist rule and pledged to lead his country to free elections.
   In a televised New Year's speech, the new non-Communist leader
said he wanted the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II to visit
Czechoslovakia and called for full diplomatic ties with the Vatican
and Israel.
   He also declared a broad amnesty and reduced sentences for all
inmates except those imprisoned for murder or sex crimes, or for
officials who ``abused public authority.''
   Also Monday, Communist Premier Marian Calfa said the government
intends to adopt free-market principles and increase ties with
Western Europe, the official CTK news agency reported.
   ``We shall consistently part with the system of management that
prevailed in our country for many years. Our strategic goal is to
prepare the transition to a market economy,'' CTK quoted him as
saying.
   The speech by Havel, a playwright and human rights activist who
was jailed for five years by the former hard-line Communist
leadership, was the first since Parliament on Friday elected him
president to culminate Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution.
   ``Out of gifted and sovereign people, the (Communist) regime
made us little screws in a monstrously big, rattling and stinking
machine. We have become morally sick,'' said Havel.
   ``Our country does not flourish ... we have the worst
environment in Europe,'' he said.
   Before World War II, Czechoslovakia was an economic power in
Europe, but it slid into stagnation under Communist rule. Pollution
from the heavy industrial plants fostered by the Communists ravaged
the environment.
   ``We have to accept this legacy as something we have inflicted
upon ourselves,'' he said, using vivid language that contrasted
with the bland style of his predecessors.
   Havel said ``rivers of blood'' have flowed through many East
bloc countries over the past four decades, including Romania in the
past two weeks, as their citizens struggled against Communism.
   ``These great sacrifices are a tragic backdrop of the present
freedom or gradual freeing of nations of the Soviet bloc, that is a
backdrop of our newly gained freedom too,'' Havel said in his
28-minute speech.
   He emphasized the need to bring his country to free elections
and renew Czechoslovakia's prestige abroad.
   ``My first task is to use all my authority and influence'' so
that Czechoslovakia can have ``free elections soon and in a
dignified way,'' he said.
   Free elections for the nation's 35O-seat Parliament are
tentatively scheduled for June, although no date has been announced.
   ``I would be happy if, even for just one day, Pope John Paul II
and the Tibetan Dalai Lama visited our country, before the
elections,'' Havel said. ``And if, still before the elections, we
managed to establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican and Israel.''
   As recently as two years ago, the Polish-born pope lamented the
``sorry state'' of the Roman Catholic church in Czechoslovakia.
Five Czechoslovak dioceses lack bishops, despite two years of
negotiations between the Vatican and the ousted leadership, which
sought to limit the church's role in society.
   However, the new government has pledged religious freedom.
Havel's first gesture after his selection Friday was to attend a
thanksgiving Mass. About 65 percent of Czechoslovakia's 15.6
million people are Roman Catholics.
   The newly chosen president also said he would like to establish
diplomatic ties with the Vatican and with Israel. All Warsaw Pact
nations except Romania cut ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East War.
   Hungary, also in the grip of democratic change, was the first to
renew full ties in September, and the Soviet Union and Poland
renewed low-level ties in the last three years.
   Last month, Poland and Czechoslovakia said full ties with the
Jewish state would be renewed in 1990.
   ``I want to contribute to peace also by my visit tomorrow to our
two related neighbors, that is the German Democratic Republic and
the Federal Republic of Germany,'' Havel said.
   Havel travels to both German states Tuesday in his first trip
abroad in two decades. The playwright, whose works were banned in
his native country until recent weeks, won several international
awards but declined to attend such services, fearing that Communist
authorities would not allow him back to his homeland.

   Police issued a nationwide public
health warning Monday after a supply of highly toxic gold cyanide
was stolen from a vault at an electronics company.
   About 2.2 pounds of the lethal chemical vanished from a Philips
factory in Eindhoven along with 1,320 pounds of less dangerous
palladium, apparently in a pre-dawn burglary Monday, according to
police spokesman Arie van der Tooren.
   A police announcement broadcast by Dutch Television warned that
``inexpert use'' of especially the cyanide is ``extremely harmful''
to public health.
   The two chemicals, which are worth at least $450,000, are used
in the manufacture of electric resistors, Van der Tooren said.
   He speculated that the thieves may have stolen the cyanide in
order to extract gold in a process that would release toxic acid.

<HEAD>Man Who Leaped at Princess Diana Charged With Assaulting Runner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORPETH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who lunged at Princess Diana eight
months ago was charged Monday with indecently assaulting Britain's
top woman marathon runner, police and relatives said.
   Veronique Marot, women's winner of the 1989 London Marathon and
the British record-holder, was warming up for the Morpeth to
Newcastle road race in Northumbria in northeast England when a man
in a track suit bearing a runner's number suddenly approached her.
   ``He simply leaped out and grabbed me from the front and
wouldn't let go of my arms,'' she said. ``I got a real shock. He
held on tight. Then he tried to fondle me.''
   Police said Monday night a man was arrested and would appear
before magistrates at nearby Bedlington on Tuesday. They refused to
identify him.
   But Hetty Adcock identified the man as her son, Ted Adcock, who
lives with her. ``The police rang to tell me they'd arrested him at
the race. It's all very upsetting,'' said Mrs. Adcock, 86.
   Adcock, 57, made headlines in April when he leaped from a crowd
at Princess Diana as she was talking to members of a crowd in
Northumberland. He later said he meant her no harm _ he only wanted
to give her a hug.
   In August 1988, Adcock was ejected from the Gateshead sports
stadium after embracing U.S. sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner. He
was not charged in connection with that incident or the one
involving the princess.
   Marot, 34, shrugged off Monday's incident and went on to win the
14-mile race.

<TEXT>
   African leaders trying to mediate
peace talks between the Mozambican government and guerrillas say
conditions are becoming ripe for direct talks, Mozambique's foreign
minister said Monday.
   Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said on Radio Maputo that
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
had made progress in their efforts, and the Mozambican government
is prepared to talk to members of the Mozambican National
Resistance.
   Pascoal said the mediators told the Mozambican government ``that
the conditions are becoming ripe for a direct dialogue'' between
the Mozambican government and Renamo, the guerrilla group.
   The Kenyan and Zimbabwean leaders have been facilitating talks
between Mozambican churchmen and guerrilla representatives.
   The Mozambican National Resistance began fighting the government
forces in 1977. White-run Rhodesia first supported them, then South
Africa.
   The South African government has said it no longer supports the
guerrillas, but Mocumbi said ``within South Africa, some forces,
even if they are not supported by the government, continue to seek
to use the Renamo bandits as an instrument.'' He said there had
been a reduction in the amount of aid reaching the guerrillas from
across the border, but some assistance continued.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives, displaced more
than 1 million people and left about half the population in need of
food aid.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solomon Birnbaum, a Jewish scholar credited with
establishing the authenticity and age of the Dead Sea Scrolls, has
died. He was 98.
   Birnbaum, a native Austrian who was an expert in ancient Jewish
languages, wrote two books on Hebrew and Yiddish and dozens of
articles and research papers in an academic career that spanned
most of this century.
   The scrolls, discovered in caves near the Dead Sea beginning in
1947, include the oldest known manuscripts of the Bible. Birnbaum
analyzed the grammar and script to date them from the third century
B.C. to A.D. 68, the same period later established by carbon-dating
techniques.
   ``Some of his main discoveries, in academic terms, were
path-breaking ... remarkable analyses of manuscript material,''
said his son Eleazar, a professor of Middle East and Islamic
studies at the University of Toronto.
   His father's work allowed researchers to read and evaluate many
documents, he said.
   Birnbaum was born in Vienna. The University of Hamburg, West
Germany, created a teaching position for him in the field of Jewish
studies in 1922. He fled to England in 1933 when Hitler came to
power and taught at the University of London until his retirement
in 1957.
   Birnbaum continued his research, and moved to Canada in 1970.
   He died Thursday in Toronto and funeral services were held
Friday, his son said.

<HEAD>Tentative Accord Reached in Nine-Month Pittston Coal Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials announced tentative agreement Monday
to end a violence-plagued, 9-month-old strike against the Pittston
Co. by 1,700 coal miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   ``We can continue to try to scratch each other's eyes out or we
can accept a relationship where we can grow together,'' United Mine
Workers President Richard Trumka told a news conference in the
office of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Trumka said it is unclear when miners will return to work, but
he said the agreement would be placed before the rank and file for
ratification within eight to 10 days.
   Terms were not disclosed immediately. Both sides called it ``a
victory for collective bargaining'' but said they want striking
miners to hear the specifics first from union leaders.
   In Montgomery, Ala., President Bush issued a statement that he is
   ``delighted'' with the settlement. Bush, on his way back from a
fishing trip, said, ``I want to wish the families and communities
of the mine workers a very happy New Year as they look forward to
the benefits of a new contract.''
   Marathon bargaining between the UMW and the nation's largest
coal exporter included a 96-hour session just before Christmas.
Former Labor Secretary W.J. Usery, who served as mediator and vowed
to find a solution over the holidays, termed the dispute the
toughest of his career.
   ``At 10:30 last night we had a handshake,'' he said.
   The strike was marked by mammoth labor rallies, vandalism and
rock-throwing confrontations between strikers and other company
employees.
   The union is currently facing fines totaling $63.5 million for
violating court orders limiting picketing and other strike
activities. ``We hope that we can resolve all the outstanding
litigation and charges,'' Usery said.
   Mrs. Dole said one of the most difficult issues was the
long-term security of pension and health care benefits for miners
and their families. Coal workers said the strike was prompted
primarily by Pittston's move to end its contributions to the UMW's
industry-wide retirement fund.
   Mrs. Dole promised to appoint a commission ``which will review
all aspects of the pension and health care issue and make
recommendations to me for dealing with it.''
   She and the negotiators said the commission was prompted by the
need for a broad, industry-wide means of bolstering the pension
fund. She said the panel would report back to her in six months but
its recommendations would not change Monday's agreement.
   ``The funds issue has been settled between Pittston and the
United Mine Workers,'' Trumka declared. He said the provisions
would stay in effect ``for the life of the agreement.''
   ``I think the members will be extremely happy with the agreement
that is presented to them,'' Trumka said.
   Usery said the negotiators ``came to what I really belive is a
... reasonable solution to both sides. It is fair. It is honorable.
We hope and pray that it won't just be another Band-Aid, but it
will be something permanent.''
   ``We just couldn't be happier to stand before you today,''
Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas said. ``We think we've met the
essential objections of all those concerned.''
   The strike began April 5. As the bitterness grew, 46,000 mine
workers in 10 states walked off their jobs in sympathy at one point.
   Pittston's coal subsidiary, Pittston Coal Group Inc., had said
it could not afford to continue payments into the fund, which
covers 130,000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976. The
company, 560 of whose retirees are covered by the fund, objected to
making contributions to the pensions of thousands of employees of
other companies.
   The UMW had said that other companies would attempt to escape
from the fund if Pittston were allowed to do so.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said in a statement, ``I'm
delighted the strike has been settled. Let me say that there is no
threat to the pensions of the 125,000 retirees across the country.''
   Usery was named mediator by Mrs. Dole in October after she
visited striking workers in the coal fields of southern Virginia.
   Strikers occupied a Pittston processing plant in Carbo, Va., for
several days in September and mines were blocked elsewhere. More
than 2,000 strikers were arrested in the first three months of the
walkout, many for sit-down demonstrations and some for rock
throwing. Three union officials were jailed.
   Wildcat strikers from other states joined bumper-to-bumper
convoys to slow Pittston coal shipments.
   As the strike went on, Pittston hired replacement workers, but
production was well below pre-strike levels. The company said its
coal operations lost $3.6 million in the second quarter of 1989 and
$9.8 million in the third quarter, compared with profits of $9
million and $7.4 million in the respective quarters of 1988.

   Light snow was scattered over the northeastern quarter of the
nation Monday and rain and snow moved into the central Pacific
Coast.
   The coming of the New Year ended a December that included
numerous records for temperatures and precipitation, the National
Weather Service said.
   Light snow or snow showers spread over the Great Lakes, the
upper Ohio Valley and the northern Atlantic Coast region.
   In West Virginia, 6 inches of snow fell late Sunday into Monday
morning at Valley Head.
   A cold front spread rain and drizzle across the central Pacific
Coast and snow to some of the higher elevations of the West. Three
to 6 inches of snow was possible in California's Sierra Nevada
north of Yosemite National Park.
   A few light showers dampened the lower Rio Grande valley of
Texas during the afternoon.
   Heavy rain fell late Sunday and into early Monday over the
Southeast. Heaviest rainfall totals for the 24 hours up to 7 a.m.
EST were 3.64 inches at Mary Esther, Fla.; 3.11 inches at
Valparaiso, Fla.; 2.78 inches at Albany, Ga., and 2.67 inches at
Dothan, Ala.
   Temperatures dipped into the single digits and below zero early
Monday in the north-central region. Monday's low for the Lower 48
states was 10 degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn.
   Temperatures remained below freezing during the afternoon in the
upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region.
   More than 20 cities reported their coldest December on record,
using the mean temperature for the month:
   Akron, Ohio, 18.2; Atlantic City, N.J., 24.7; Brownsville,
Texas, 51.8, second coldest month on record; Charleston, W.Va.,
26.0; Cincinnati, 21.6; Concord, N.H., 11.9; Dayton, Ohio, 19.0;
Elkins, W.Va., 18.4; Flint, Mich., 16.1; Harrisburg, Pa., 22.6;
Hartford, Conn., 18.1; Mansfield, Ohio, 17.0; Pittsburgh, Pa.,
19.4; Providence, R.I., 21.8; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., 7.3;
Scranton, Pa., 18.6; Syracuse, N.Y., 14.7; Toledo, Ohio, 16.8;
Williamsport, Pa., 19.8; Wilmington, Del., 25.0; Worcester, Mass.,
15.1; and Youngstown, Ohio, 18.2.
   In three cities, December mean reading toppled records on the
books since 1876: Buffalo, N.Y., at 17.4, compared to 19.5 in 1876;
Nashville, Tenn., at 29.5, compared to 30.4 in 1876; and Rochester,
N.Y., at 17.1, compared to 18.5 in 1876.
   It was the snowiest December on record at Atlantic City, N.J.,
which got 9.2 inches of snow. It was the third snowiest December at
Charleston, W.Va., with 14.1 inches, and at Elkins, W.Va., with
32.2 inches.
   While Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., was having its coldest December
on record, it also had its sunniest December with sunshine 45
percent of the daylight hours. Its average for December is just 27
percent.
   Pocatello, Idaho, had its driest December on record with just
0.07 of an inch of precipitation. In California, both San Francisco
and Sacramento tied their records for December at zero
precipitation, the same as in 1876.
   The year 1989 was the wettest on record for Baton Rouge, La.,
with 88.32 inches of precipitation, and for Huntsville, Ala., which
got 73.57 inches.

   Sudan's military government said Monday
that it had released 36 political prisoners.
   Information Minister Ali Mohamed Shummo said in a statement to
the official Sudan News Agency that the 36 ``are welcome to join

   The release Sunday coincided with Sudan's 34th independence
anniversary but included no prominent figures. Former Prime

Ibrahim Nugud, secretary-general of the Communist Party, remain in
detention.
   Hassan Turbabi, Secretary-General of the fundmentalist National
Islamic Front, and Mohamed Osman el-Mirghani of the Democratic
Unionist Party were released last year but remain under house
arrest.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who toppled el-Mahdi's civilian
government in a June 30 coup, dissolved all political parties,
Parliament and other constitutional institutions and declared a
state of emergency.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran won a vote of
confidence in the kingdom's revitalized Parliament on Monday after
telling the lawmakers he will end Jordan's 22 years of martial law
within six months.
   Badran also promised to repeal the 1953 law banning communism,
to reconsider the 1957 law banning political parties and to review
the cases of political prisoners for a possible amnesty.
   ``The government is committed to fulfilling the constitution in
its spirit and its letter and intends to abolish martial law within
a period of four to six months,'' Badran said in his two-hour
speech.
   More 1,000 people packed the public gallery and cheered as
Badran spoke, and women wailed in joy in a traditiional Arabic
celebration afterward.
   The vote followed more than two days of debate in the new,
80-member Parliament, which is determined to pry further reforms
from the Cabinet. Badran was named prime minister Dec. 4. His
Cabinet was appointed two days later.
   At King Hussein's insistence, the November elections were the
freest held here since the early days of independence in the
mid-1950s.
   Only nine deputies voted against the government on Monday, and
six others abstained. Such a vote is required for all new cabinets.
   Badran had already removed most powers from military courts,
which have considered everything from homicides to political crimes
to price-gouging on vegetables since martial law was declared
during the 1967 war with Israel.
   In that conflict, Jordan lost the West Bank, which held half the
seats in the old parliament. Hussein's renunciation of sovereignty
over the territory last year in favor of the Palestine Liberation
Organization paved the way for election of a revigorated and
expanded parliament.
   The prime minister, at times choking with emotion, lashed back
at those who alleged corruption during his earlier terms as premier
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, saying, ``I am proud of my
honesty and my proper dealings.''
   Badran said his previous governments prosecuted hundreds of
people on corruption charges.
   He offered to give an account of his property and finances to
Parliament to answer questions raised by deputies about the source
of his wealth.
   The prime minister said he would lift immunity from prosecution
from any minister or parliamentary deputy accused of corrution.
   He also insisted he was proud of his past as head of the General
Intelligence Department, a background that has drawn fire from some
deputies.
   ``If you look at other countries you will see there is nothing
wrong with this. Bush is a CIA man,'' he said, referring to
President Bush's former post as director of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   Deputies later said they would keep Badran under scrutiny.
   ``We will not hesitate to call the premier for a vote of no
confidence if Mr. Badran does not fulfill all his promises to us,''
said Nawaf Khawaldeh, an independent Islamic activist.
   Badran won the votes of most Islamic activists after promising
to ban alcohol in all public institutions and at government parties.
   He did not say Monday if that ban includes flights aboard the
state-owned Royal Jordanian airline, as the fundamentalist Moslem
Brotherhood demands.
   He also stopped short of agreeing to the Brotherhood's demand to
ban liquor sales in all public places.
   He said Jordan will establish an academy for Islamic law.
   Forty-nine deputies rose to speak during the long debate and
most demanded that the government accelerate a democratic trend
that Hussein launched in April after four days of rioting over
price rises.
   The government earlier reduced the General Intelligence
Department power to interfere in passport and job permits and
loosened controls on the press.

   An Israeli immigration agency reported Monday
that 71,509 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1989, the
highest number in two decades.
   Of the emigrants, 11,994 have settled in Israel, the most since
the early 1970s, according to figures released by the Jewish
Agency, a quasi-governmental organization funded by Jews overseas
that handles the newcomers in Israel.
   The highest monthly emigration figure last year was registered
in November when 11,170 Soviet Jews have left the country, the
figures showed. Of these, 1,828 came to Israel.
   In December 1989, 3,500 Jews came to Israel out of 8,540 who
left the Soviet Union. In 1988, only 2,173 settled in Israel. In
1987, the figure was 2,069.
   Israeli officials predict that 30,000 to 50,000 Soviet Jews will
arrive in 1990 because of liberalized emigration laws and new U.S.
immigration restrictions.
   The first 125 Soviet immigrants this year arrived Monday on a
direct flight from Moscow aboard Israel's El Al airline, making
them the first Soviet Jews to immigrate directly to Israel from the
Soviet Union.
   The immigrants had waited for 10 days to come to Israel via
Romania. They received permission Sunday to join the return flight
that brought Israel's Habima national theater to the Soviet Union.
   Israel and the Soviet Union signed an agreement last month to
begin direct flights between the two countries.
   El Al president Rafi Har-lev greeted the 125 immigrants at the
airport and said he hoped regularly scheduled flights will begin
soon.
   As many as 300,000 Soviet immigrants are expected in Israel in
the next three years. The cost of settling the immigrants is
estimated at $3 billion, with U.S. and other Jews abroad expected
to contribute $500 million of that.

   With police standing guard outside, about 200
people attending an NAACP church program Monday offered prayer,
song and humor in the face of threats issued on the heels of a
recent series of mail bombs.
   The New Year's Day program at a southwest Atlanta church began
after a search by agents from the FBI, Georgia Bureau of
Investigation and Atlanta police, including bomb-sniffing dogs. No
explosives were found.
   The annual NAACP program commemorating the Emancipation
Proclamation was one of several held across the nation, but
attracted special attention because Atlanta is the center of an
investigation of bombings that last month killed a federal judge
and an attorney.
   The FBI refused Monday to comment on the progress of the
investigation. A letter to an Atlanta television station, disclosed
last Thursday, claimed responsibility for the bombs and threatened
to kill two NAACP members.
   Narvis Grier, the former longtime executive secretary of the
Atlanta NAACP, said threats of violence always have been a part of
the organization's history.
   ``The NAACP is the oldest, the largest, the most hated and the
most respected civil rights organization,'' she told the gathering
at Hoosier United Methodist Church.
   The Rev. Richard Wynn, pastor of Hoosier, said some people who
might normally attend ``Emancipation Day'' events called him Monday
morning to say they would not be coming this year because of the
threats. The crowd in attendance, though wildly enthusiastic in
their response to the program, did not fill the church.
   ``In light of what has happened, it was an appropriate
turnout,'' Wynn said after the program.
   Killed in last month's bombings were 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Robert Robinson of Savannah, a black
lawyer who worked with the NAACP.
   Two other bombs _ one to a federal courthouse in Atlanta and one
to an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla. _ were intercepted before
they could explode.
   The Atlanta police sent four patrol cars with officers to stand
guard outside the church during the 3{-hour service, which included
a sermon, hymns by the Wheat Street Baptist Church Choir and
speeches, most of which made reference to the bombings.
   Dr. Otis W. Smith, president of the Atlanta NAACP chapter, said
Monday morning's search was done as a precaution rather than in
response to a specific threat.
   ``They assured us everything was all right before we came in,''
Smith said.
   From the pulpit, Wynn asked for prayers for the ``sick minds and
twisted spirit'' responsible for the recent violence. He and other
speakers vowed there would be no intimidation.
   Monday's program marked the anniversary of the date in 1863 when
the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. President Abraham
Lincoln issued the proclamation the previous year to free slaves in
states then at war with the Union.

   A helicopter pilot who whisked Nicolae
Ceausescu and his wife from the roof of Commmunist Party
headquarters said he had a gun pointed at his head throughout the
ordeal by one of the late dictator's personal bodyguards.
   Romanian pilot Vasile Malutan, 46, recalled in the New Year's
edition of Romania Libera how he was ordered to fly to the party's
Central Committee building and pick up the Ceausescus on Dec. 22
after they were booed on a balcony by tens of thousands of people
assembled below in Palace Square.
   ``It was an impossible mission because it isn't`normal for
helicopters to fly over crowds of millionsl'' the daily quoted
Malutan as saying. The paper didn't account for Malutan's
exaggeration of the number of demonstrators.
   ``The dictator and his wife came with four people, including
Maria Manescu and Emil Bobu,'' the pilot said, adding that other
party leaders were left behind.
   Bobu was a high-ranking Politburo member. Maria Manescu was the
wife of Manea Manescu, a senior party official and one of
Ceausescu's closest aides.
   Malutan said the co-pilot had to sit on Ceausescu's knees,
apparently from lack of space in the cramped cockpit, and the
aircraft made for Snagov, a village north of Bucharest where the
Ceausescus had a summer residence.
   Two security officers were also on board, Malutan told the paper.
   Mrs. Manescu and Bobu, reportedly the No. 3 in the party
hierarchy, were asked to leave the helicopter at Snagov.
   ``Mrs. Manescu kissed both of Ceausecu's hands'' before getting
off, the pilot was quoted as saying.
   Bobu was later reported arrested. Mrs. Manescu's fate is unknown.
   Malutan said he flew high so radar could trace the helicopter
and that he had a gun aimed at him during the flight by a security
guard, the daily reported. It also quoted him as saying Ceausescu
ordered him not to contact ground control.
   From Snagov the helicopter left for a military airport in Titu,
18 miles northwest of Bucharest, after Ceausescu and his wife Elena
apparently decided to flee the country.
   But as they approached the airport, Malutan said he told
Ceausescu they possibly had been tracked by radar, according to the
daily.
   Ceausescu, apparently fearful of falling into rebel army hands,
ordered Malutan to land away from airfield, and his bodyguards
hijacked a private car and its driver, the pilot was quoted as
saying.
   The French daily Liberation quoted Nicolae Petrisor, an employee
at a merchandise distribution center in Tirgoviste, west of the
capital, as saying in an interview Saturday that the Ceausescus
forced him to drive them around the surrounding area for hours
seeking a safe hiding place.
   The dictator, in the front seat of Petrisor's black Dacia car,
was often in tears, Petrisor was quoted as saying.
   The Ceausescus were finally apprehended by workers at a factory
near Tirgoviste and were handed over to the army, the paper said.
   The Ceausescus were reported executed by firing squad three days
later, on Christmas Day, following a summary trial that holiday
morning.

   An intense predawn fire that began in an
automobile repair shop damaged three houses, forced the evacuation
of 75 to 100 people and cut power to a neighborhood Monday before
it was`brought under control.
   Flames shot 150 feet into the air and pumper trucks had to use
hydrants blocks away from the working-class neighborhood near
downtown because its water mains could not carry enough water to
the blaze, fire officials said.
   Fire Capt. Mike Vanderwall was treated at a hospital and
released after he was injured in a fall while fighting the blaze,
said Capt. Terry Tullier, a city fire department spokesman. No
other injuries were reported.
   ``The fire was so intense that we had to move two of our fire
engines. The fire engines were smoking from the heat and it had
cracked the glass. So we evacuated houses across the street,''
Tullier said.
   Flames spread from the Napoleon Auto Repair and Paint Shop to
gut two nearby houses. A third residence was damaged and a parked
car crushed when a shop wall collapsed.
   The 75 to 100 evacuees were allowed back in their homes after
the fire was brought under control about 7 a.m.
   About 120 firefighters fought the blaze, Tullier said. The cause
of the fire was under investigation.
   Several utility poles were burned, knocking out power in the
area. Natural gas service was halted because several gas meters
were burned and the gas had been feeding the fire, Tullier said.
   Fire Chief William McCrossen said the fire damaged one-half to
three-quarters of the block, which is on the eastern edge of
downtown near the intersection of Elysian Fields and Claiborne
avenues.

<TEXT>
   State Treasurer Ann Richards filed with the
Democratic Party on Monday, making official her bid for governor
and calling it ``a great way to begin the new year.''
   ``I woke up this morning and had some blackeyed peas for luck,
then came downtown to file. There's a certain significance to
beginning the new year this way,'' Ms. Richards said.
   ``My resolutions are to stay cool and win the election,'' she
said.
   Ms. Richards was keynote speaker at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, when she attacked Republican policies
saying, ``That dog won't hunt.''
   Her declaration that then-Vice President George Bush was born
with a silver foot in his mouth prompted Bush to send her a silver
foot pin, which she wore when the president addressed the Texas
Legislature early in 1989.
   Her quips and one-liners set the tone for the nomination of
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duikakis as Democratic presidential
nominee.
   She currently has her autobiography on the market nationally.
   She announced last June her plans to run for governor ``because
I believe that it is time and because of all the things I've stood
for all of my life.''
   She faces a spirited battle with Attorney General Jim Mattox for
the Democratic nomination, and former Gov. Mark White also is in
the race.
   On the Republican side, where incumbent Gov. Bill Clements is
not running, candidates include Railroad Commission Chairman Kent
Hance, who made unsuccessful runs for the U.S. Senate in 1986 and
governor in 1988; oilman Clayton Williams; Houston businessman Jack
Rains; Dallas lawyer Tom Luce; and Fort Worth minister W.T. Otwell.
   Ms. Richards, who would be Texas' second woman governor in 55
years, said the economy, long in a downslide due to oil and real
estate busts, needs new leadership.
   ``People are looking for leaders who hold themselves to the
highest ethical standards. They're looking for leaders who have a
proven track record of sound fiscal management. And I'm proud to
say that's what I offer the people of Texas in 1990.''

<TEXT>
   A barge loaded with 100,000 gallons of
gasoline hit a bridge and ruptured Monday, spilling about 10,000
gallons into the ice-choked Monongahela River.
   The barge was one of at least 50 to break loose from moorings
along a 40-mile stretch of the river from Brownsville north to
Pittsburgh.
   The leaking barge, owned by Gutman Oil Co. in Charleroi, broke
loose about 8:30 a.m., hit the Monongahela Bridge and ruptured
about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   Emergency crews tied the barge to shore and planned to pump the
gasoline into an empty tanker. Only one compartment of the barge
was ruptured, so there was little danger of all 100,000 gallons
spilling into the river.
   Meanwhile, rising water on the river from a weekend thaw forced
about 200 people to temporarily evacuate their homes Monday near
Maxwell, about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   Another gasoline barge was hung up in Charleroi near
Monongahela, but state environmental officials said the river was
so high that crews could not get near the barge to determine if it
was leaking.
   Local health officials and water companies were notified of the
spill, estimated at 10,000 gallons, but no contamination of water
supplies was reported, said Betsy Mallison, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Environmental Resources.
   Pittsburgh's water supply was not in danger from the spill
because it draws water from the Allegheny River.
   Several miles south of Monday's spill, about 25 coal barges
broke loose and piled up at a dam. An additional dozen barges broke
loose in Pittsburgh and floated into the Ohio River. Three of those
barges were stuck under a bridge in downtown Pittsburgh, forcing
state Department of Transportation crews to close the span to
traffic.
   ``We're afraid that ice and debris will pile up behind the
barges, damming up the channel,'' said Dick Skrinjar, a state
transportation spokesman.
   State police reported that a barge sank somewhere between
Dunlevy, south of Charleroi, and New Eagle, just north of
Monongahela, but officials had no details.

   Police shot into a crowd of
residents that stormed the police station because of officials'
refusal to search for a 9-year-old girl missing on New Year's Eve
and wounded 21 people, according to a radio report.
   Residents later found the body of the girl, who reportedly had
been raped and strangled, near train tracks on the outskirts of
this farming community 310 miles south of the capital Buenos Aires.
   None of the 21 was seriously injured, Radio Tres Arroyos said in
its report. Police said they resorted to firing rubber bullets and
small-caliber handguns to disperse the crowd that stormed the
station.
   Radio Tres Arroyos said the incident began Sunday when Nair
Mustafa left home in the afternoon to go to a club pool. When she
did not return home, her parents checked with the club, then asked
police to search.
   According to the mother, police refused ``because all of them
were celebrating New Year's,'' Radio Tres Arroyos told listeners in
this wheat belt city of 60,000.
   Many residents stopped their own celebrations to comb the city
until the body of the child was found near the railroad tracks.
According to the radio report, she had been raped and strangled.
   Angered, several hundred residents converged on the main police
station shortly after midnight, hurling verbal abuse and setting
fire to two patrol cars. Police shot and wounded five.
   Hours later, in full daylight, about 5,000 residents gathered
outside police headquarters and city hall. During melees in which
residents threw rocks on both buildings as well as a few firebombs,
16 others were shot and wounded.
   Police eventually dispersed the crowds with tear gas.
   By evening, police from nearby Bahia Blanca and Mar del Plata
said calm had been restored.
   Miguel Mussa, director of security for Buenos Aires Province,
said police at the station in question had been removed, but he did
not indicate whether they had been dismissed or whether any
sanctions would be applied.

<HEAD>President Herzog Intervenes in Israel's Government Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with new material and editing, UPDATING with
President Herzog suggests compromise, Palestinian killed. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Chaim Herzog stepped into the
government crisis on Monday and suggested a compromise that may
help prevent the collapse of the Cabinet coalition of the Likud and
Labor parties.
   Both sides sought an end to the crisis set off when Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of Likud, fired Science Minister Ezer
Weizman of the center-left Labor Party because of Weizman's
supposed contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses
to negotiate with it.
   Herzog told Shamir in a private meeting that accusations of this
sort called for a ``proper legal inquiry'' to examine the facts,
political sources said.
   Israel television said Herzog suggested Weizman be allowed to
remain science minister until the inquiry is completed, but Labor
Party leader and Vice Premier Shimon Peres quickly rejected this,
saying the damage had already been done.
   The presidency is a mainly ceremonial position and it is unusual
for Herzog to become involved in political affairs. A spokesman at
Herzog's residence said they do not publicize information from
private meetings.
   Leaders of both sides have said they do not want to see the
government fall over the issue, but Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz of the
Shas party, who is trying to mediate, said he saw no way to prevent
the collapse.
   ``It's hard to say I see a way out,'' Peretz said on Israel
radio. ``Yesterday I did, now I don't. I can only say I'm sorry
because the price will be paid by the Israeli people and the
government.''
   Collapse of the year-old government could be the final blow to
Israel's peace plan, which calls for elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip as a step toward autonomy for the territories.
   The army, meanwhile, confined 1.1 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands to their homes to block violence on the 25th
anniversary of the founding of Fatah, the mainstream faction of PLO
chief Yasser Arafat.
   Despite the curfew throughout the Gaza Strip and in several
large towns in the West Bank, Palestinians marked the day by waving
posters of Arafat, honking car horns, or flying outlawed
Palestinian flags.
   In A-Ram six miles north of Jerusalem, Allah Bader Ez Eddin
al-Hatib, 17, was fatally shot in back when troops fired to
disperse about 50 masked youths holding a parade, the army said.
   Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a
stone-throwing protest by about 150 Palestinians in Shufat village,
within Jerusalem's boundaries, police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   Four Palestinians were reported shot or beaten in clashes with
soldiers in the Gaza Strip, Arab reporters said.
   Some Labor and Likud leaders were trying to work out a
compromise Monday to save the coaltion, an aide to Shamir said.
   Like other political sources, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
   After Shamir announced Weizman's firing on Sunday, Labor
demanded that he rescind the dismissal, which takes effect Tuesday.
   Shamir has been under increasing pressure from Labor party
officials and from his own Likud bloc to present Weizman with the
evidence against him. Justice Minister Dan Meridor, of Likud, said
on Israel TV he believed Weizman would resign once the facts were
presented before him.
   Sources in the Labor Party said their backing for Weizman could
change if shown the evidence against him, Israel radio said.
   However, Labor leaders were reported considering joining
left-wing parties in a vote of no confidence Wednesday, which could
bring down the so-called unity government. It was formed a year ago
after inconclusive national elections.
   Peretz said on Israel radio that Shamir was refusing to agree to
a compromise in which Weizman would lose his post as science
minister but would remain as a minister-without-portfolio in the
26-member Cabinet.
   Both Shamir and Peres held meetings Monday with leaders of four
religious parties in hopes of persuading the small parties to join
a new ruling coalition to replace the Likud-Labor government.
   The religious parties have 12 seats in the 120-member
Parliament, giving them clout in deciding whether the 39-seat Labor
or 40-seat Likud could form a narrow coalition.

<HEAD>`Lady Chatterley's Lover' as Radio Bedtime Story Sparks Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Britons started listening to ``Lady
Chatterley's Lover'' as their bedtime story Monday night, complete
with sexually explicit passages and four-letter words that have
outraged anti-pornography campaigners.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. decided to go ahead with its
15-part radio adaptation of the unexpurgated version of D.H.
Lawrence's novel despite efforts by the country's leading TV
watchdog, Mary Whitehouse, to keep it off the air.
   In addition to broadcasting the first part of Lady Chatterley's
romp down the primrose path with the gameskeeper, BBC Radio 4
preceded it with a nearly 2{-hour reconstruction of the 1960 trial
at which Penguin Books was charged with obscenity for publishing
the sexually-explicit version.
   Both programs started with warnings they contained words and
descriptions of sexual acts some listeners might find offensive.
   It took 30 years from the first printing of ``Lady Chatterley's
Lover'' in Florence, Italy, to the celebrated Penguin edition of
1960 and another 30 years before that version was judged fit to be
heard on radio. The uncensored version was published in the United
States in 1959.
   The Penguin trial gave the all-clear for the book's full
publication in Britain and was regarded as one of the key events
that led to a more permissive attitude to sexual morality in the
1960s.
   The choice of the original ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' to launch
the 42nd year of BBC Radio's ``A Book at Bedtime'' was one of its
most daring. In a highly unusual move, the choice was approved by
the BBC Board of Governors, who don't normally get involved in such
program decisions.
   Listeners to ``A Book at Bedtime'' have heard a wide range of
titles, from the classics to popular literature. Recent titles
include the James Bond thriller ``On Her Majesty's Secret Service''
and John Le Carre's ``The Russia House,'' read by the author.
   The BBC says an average of 250,000 listeners tune into ``A Book
at Bedtime.'' The audience is predominantly middle-class and over
50.
   Lawrence said after he wrote ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' that he
knew it would bring ``only abuse and hatred.'' The BBC said it is
expecting fresh protests.
   ``Of course some people are going to be offended, but there
isn't much I can do about that, except not broadcast the book,''
Michael Green, Controller of Radio 4, was quoted as telling The
Sunday Telegraph.
   ``I think it is much too important an event in English
literature to go on being overlooked. As for the offending words _
well, you can hear them on television most nights,'' he was quoted
as saying.

   Miners striking Pittston coal operations in
West Virginia will continue to walk picket lines until union
members decide whether to approve a new tentative contract
agreement, a union official said Monday.
   The United Mine Workers and The Pittston Co., parent of Pittston
Coal Group, announced the tentative agreement Monday after
protracted bargaining sessions in Washington, D.C., over the
holidays.
   The violence-plagued, 9-month-old strike idled 1,700 coal miners
in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. At one point, it sparked
sympathy walkouts by 46,000 miners in nearly a dozen states.
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, with both sides
saying they wanted the miners to hear details from their leaders.
UMW President Richard Trumka said specifics should go to the rank
and file within eight to 10 days.
   ``I noticed they used the term `tentative' when they announced
the agreement. The miners will stay on the picket line until
notified otherwise,'' said Howard Green, a UMW international board
member from Charleston-based District 17.
   Picket lines at Pittston's Logan County mines were not manned on
New Year's Day.
   ``As far as (Tuesday picketing) goes, we're taking it as just
another day,'' said Roger Nelson, UMW member from Boone County and
coordinator of Camp Solidarity II in Logan County.
   Miners drifted in and out of the camp Monday while word of the
tentative settlement circulated. The ``camp'' was set up in a
vacant department store to give miners, their families and
supporters a place to congregate, sleep and eat over the holidays.
   Larry Ward, president of UMW District 6 covering Ohio and West
Virginia's Northern Panhandle, welcomed the tentative settlement
and said it was worth the sacrifice.
   ``It's just a matter of whether you ... fight for the people who
gave us this union or just throw them away like the companies do,''
Ward said.
   In Virginia, striking miners said they hoped they will be back
on the job soon.
   ``We'll be receptive to it probably,'' said Jack Bartee, a
26-year veteran of the Virginia mines and one of a handful of
striking miners at the so-called Camp Solidarity in Russell County.
   Minutes after learning of the tentative agreement, southwestern
Virginia miner Freddie Wallace got a telephone call from Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, whom he met in October during her visit
to the region.
   ``She told me she hoped this contract would mean a happy new
year and I told her it would,'' said Wallace, 47, a
third-generation coal miner.
   In Kentucky, striking miners were happy with the tentative
agreement announcement, said Bobby Roy Justice of District 30.
   ``Everybody's just tickled that there's a contract.''
   Logan County Pittston miner Everett Street, who served on the
picket lines for eight months before the union moved him to Camp
Solidarity II, said the strike couldn't be over soon enough.
   ``I'm not real happy. If you've been out of work nine months,
you can't be real happy,'' Street said. He and others said they're
waiting to hear the terms of the agreement before making a judgment.
   Street, Nelson and Local 1971 President Dave Collins predicted
some friction between other company employees and the strikers if
they return to work.
   ``Anytime you stand in front of a Mack truck coming down on you,
nudging you, it can't be peachy when you get back,'' Street said.
   Street was referring to attempts by Pittston coal trucks to
cross picket lines to reach the company's Elkay Mining Co. at Slab
Fork.
   Collins said miners must remember that an agreement doesn't
necessarily translate into employment.
   ``We can't tell the company what mines have to stay open,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A Panamanian became the senior
administrator of the Panama Canal on Monday for the first time in
its 75-year history, a move taken under the 1977 treaties that
gradually turn the waterway over to Panama.
   Economist Fernando Manfredo, the deputy administrator of the
Panama Canal Commission for 10 years, became acting administrator
and moved into his new office, canal spokeswoman Willie Frye said.
   The post of administrator has been held by Americans. The
treaties require that it be filled by a Panamanian citizen after
Jan. 1, 1990.
   The former Panama Canal Zone, the strip of land that runs along
the 50-mile-long ditch, came under Panamanian control in 1979. The
treaties transfer the canal itself to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Manfredo, 62, was named acting administrator because the United
States rejected the candidate proposed by the government of deposed
Gen. Manuel Noriega to head the canal administration. The Noriega
regime opposed Manfredo.
   The new government of President Guillermo Endara, in power for a
few days, was unable to name its own candidate by Monday's deadline.
   Endara said Monday he will give careful thought to the
nomination, which must be approved by President Bush and the U.S.
Senate.
   Congress is in recess until Jan. 20, giving Endara at least
three weeks to decide. He has said he will consider nominating
Manfredo.
   The Canal Commission, which operates the waterway, has two new
acting deputy administrators, both Americans, Ms. Frye said.
   Raymond Laverty, chief executive for planning, will be acting
deputy administrator of operations and Joseph Ward, chief executive
for administration, was named acting deputy administrator for
administration.
   Ms. Frye said organization of the commission, a U.S. government
agency, will remain the same.
   She said morale among operations people had been low because of
harassment by the government under Noriega, but had soared
following the invasion of Panama by U.S. troops on Dec. 20.
   The backlog of ships waiting to transit the canal has been
reduced to about 80. Eighty ships cleared the canal the past two
days, about the normal number.

   Fidel Castro said Monday that nothing would
divert Cuba from socialism, indicating his government would not be
swayed by the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, the Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina said.
   ``I am sure that we have all the political and moral factors to
confront any type of problem and that nothing and no one will make
our nation backtrack on the road of socialism,'' the official news
agency quoted Castro as saying.
   The Cuban president spoke in a televised New Year's message,
according to the dispatch, which was monitored in Mexico.
   He acknowledged that Cuba is facing ``difficult times'' and
praised what he called the ``exemplary conduct'' of the population
in coping with economic problems.
   In a Dec. 7 speech during funeral ceremonies for Cubans killed
in Africa, Castro said the changes in East Europe would hurt his
country, an apparent reference to its isolation and the economic
aid it expects to lose.

<HEAD>20 U.S. Diplomats Ordered Expelled by Nicaragua Leave for Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty U.S. diplomats that President
Daniel Ortega ordered expelled in retaliation for the search of its
ambassador's residence in Panama by American forces left Nicaragua
Monday night.
   The diplomats refused to speak with reporters before they and
their families boarded a commercial flight to Miami.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista government gave the Americans 72 hours to
leave the country and ordered the U.S. Embassy support staff in
Managua slashed from 320 employees to 100 on Friday after U.S.
troops raided Ambassador Antenor Ferrey's home in Panama City.
   U.S. officials said the troops were searching for weapons and
``courteously withdrew'' about four hours after they arrived when
they learned it was a diplomatic residence. A U.S. army colonel in
charge of the operation later apologized and returned rifles that
had been confiscated, Ferrey said.
   President Bush, in Texas on vacation, also apologized for the
incident but expressed wonder at the amount of arms found inside
the residence.
   The U.S. State Department called Nicaragua's retaliation an
``irresponsible overreaction.''
   Ortega described it as ``a very moderate response.''
   The departure leaves the embassy with 15 diplomats, the minimum
that a host government can restrict an embassy under international
agreement, and nine Marine guards.
   The incidents raised tension between the United States and
Nicaragua less than two months before the scheduled Feb. 25 general
elections.
   Nicaragua views the Panama invasion as proof of its assertion
that the United States may invade it to oust the leftist Sandinista
government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first U.S. combat troops left Panama on
Monday, and President Bush expressed hope the rest could leave ``as
soon as possible,'' the White House announced.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force
One that the first troops to leave were two batteries of artillery,
both from Fort Ord, Calif.
   One of the units consisted of 68 soldiers and the other of 73
GIs.
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' Fitzwater said.
Although the troops being brought home were not a large share of
those troops sent to Panama, the spokesman said, ``You've got to
start with one.''
   He said ``we want them all to come home as soon as possible''
except for the 12,000 that are permanently assigned to Panama.
Another 14,000 were sent in as part of the December invasion.
   Fitzwater said the remaining troops in Panama most likely would
leave ``on a piecemeal basis'' but offered no time frame.
   The troops were coming into Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio,
Texas.
   Fitzwater's remarks were telephoned to Washington from Air Force
One while the president and First Lady Barbara Bush were en route
to the nation's capital from Alabama. They stopped there for bass
fishing following a six-day vacation.
   Bush said on Monday his New Year's resolution is, ``peace, a
world at peace.'' For Mrs. Bush, it's ``no more desserts.''
   But Mrs. Bush conceded her resolve might not last 24 hours.
   The Bushes shared their New Year's resolutions with reporters
and well-wishers as they stepped from Air Force One. Mrs. Bush also
voiced delight over the addition of a grandchild to the first
family.
   ``Great news,'' she said, revealing that son Marvin and his wife
Margaret had just adopted a 2-month-old boy, Charles Walker Bush.
The couple also has an adopted daughter, Marshall, 3.
   The Bushes now have a dozen grandchildren, five boys and seven
girls.
   ``There's something exciting, we heard about the baby the day
our brother-in-law died. There's something nice about that, isn't
there? Sort of magical,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters en route to
Alabama from Houston. ``I cried from happiness and sadness all
day.''
   Alexander Ellis II, husband of Bush's sister Nancy Ellis, died
last Friday of a stroke at age 67. The Bushes will attend his
funeral in a Boston suburbon Tuesday.
   Mrs. Bush said Ellis had been ill and in much pain. ``He was a
wonderful man, so wonderful that we wanted him not to live because
he would have been a vegetable,'' she said.
   The Bushes stopped here for several hours of bass fishing with a
friend, Ray Scott, founder of ``Bassmaster'' magazine, which the
president has often described as his favorite.
   Both Bush and his wife fished, Mrs. Bush first from a porch on
the water and then the two in separate boats.
   Bush kidded his wife when she caught a one-pound bass. ``That's
a cute little one Barbara got. Nice little fellow...Nice going,
wonderful darling.''
   Bush himself caught at least two fish _ one about the same size
as the one his wife caught and another weighing several pounds.
   Bush also reported he exchanged New Year's greetings with his
Cabinet members and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   The Bushes were on their way back from a hunting, fishing and
golfing vacation in Texas. On Sunday they visited two military
hospitals in San Antonio where he spoke with 44 U.S. servicemen
wounded in Panama.
   The president was returning to face the same military stalemate
in Panama over the fate of deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega
that existed when he began his vacation on Dec. 27.
   But Bush and his wife were in upbeat moods as they were welcomed
in a small welcoming at this Air Force base near Montgomery.
   Bush, asked if he had a New Year's resolution, replied promptly:
``Peace, a world at peace.'' Mrs. Bush was just as quick with her
vow of ``no more desserts.''
   She said she ``always'' is combatting a weight problem and told
reporters on Air Force One she made the same resolution every year
_ and once again might not keep it.
   The Bushes said they did not stay up to welcome the New Year in.
They were in bed by 9 p.m. at their Houston hotel after a Chinese
dinner by candlelight.
   ``We were the earliest people in bed in America, I think,'' Mrs.
Bush said. ``Nine o'clock, reading in bed.''
   ``I haven't seen midnight for 40 years, I don't think,'' she
added.
   Mrs. Bush said she and the president had some champagne in their
suite, but didn't open it.
   ``I like champagne, but it doesn't like me,'' she said.

   President Guillermo Endara said
Monday that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega doesn't merit shelter ``in
the house of God'' and urged the Vatican to expel the former
dictator so U.S. forces could take him into custody.
   The White House meanwhile said the first American troops to
return home since the invasion began Dec. 20 left Panama on Monday.
Two artillery batteries totaling 141 soldiers from Fort Ord were en
route to California, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters aboard Air Force One.
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fourteen thousand troops were rushed in at President Bush's
order to join 12,000 troops permanently stationed in Panama.
   In a related development, 20 U.S. diplomats left Nicaragua on
Monday night for Miami after they were expelled by President Daniel
Ortega. Ortega gave the diplomats 72 hours to leave the country in
retaliation for the search Friday of its ambassador's residence in
Panama City by U.S. forces.
   Bush apologized for the incident, but noted the troops were
searching for weapons and found numerous in the residence of
Ambassador Antenor Ferrey, including rifles and Uzi machine guns.
U.S. officials returned the weapons after learning the home was a
diplomatic residence.
   Endara said Panama lacked a secure enough prison to hold Noriega
on criminal charges, but that he would like to see Noriega tried in
Panama after the United States prosecutes the general on drug
trafficking charges.
   ``Only after the American authorities are done ... can we have
the opportunity to extradite him to Panama and make him pay in
Panama for the crimes and offenses he has committed here in
Panama,'' Endara said after a New Year's Day Mass. ``But for the
moment we can't do it.''
   Noriega greeted the New Year shuttered in the Vatican embassy
compound where he sought sanctuary Dec. 24, four days after a U.S.
invasion toppled his government.
   On Sunday night, about 200 people held a silent candlelight
vigil outside the embassy, praying that Noriega would be brought to
justice.
   In an interview, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Panama said it
was up to Noriega to decide on his own to leave his Vatican asylum.
   ``The image of us pushing him out the door isn't what we would
expect,'' said Monsignor Marcos Gregorio McGrath. ``He will have to
leave by his own decision.''
   McGrath said the United States could offer Noriega greater
personal security and a fair trial.
   ``He will have to weigh his choices and come up with that which
is the least disagreeable,'' McGrath said at his home.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military
operations in Central and South America, said it arrested Rodolfo
``Papito'' Chiari, a close Noriega crony who also served as his
interior and justice minister, on Saturday. The military communique
gave no details.
   The Southern Command also said 50 members of the ``Machos del
Monte'' battalion of Noriega's Defense Forces surrendered Sunday
near Rio Hato, 80 miles southwest of Panama City.
   Endara said the impasse could end if the Vatican and the papal
nuncio ``say once and for all that Noriega doesn't deserve to be
sheltered in the house of God, that he is a common criminal of the
worst kind and should abandon the sacred place.''
   He again appealed to Monsignor Sebastian Laboa, the papal
nuncio, to turn over Noriega.
   ``I've only asked the nuncio to throw him out of the nunciature.
What happens outside is another matter,'' said Endara. ``Of course
I must admit that when he is outside, he will fall in the hands of
the United States, not because the nuncio will give him to the
United States, but because the embassy is surrounded by U.S.
soldiers.''
   Noriega was indicted in 1988 in Florida on drug trafficking
charges.
   Noting that its Panama City embassy is accredited to the
Panamanian government and not U.S. forces, the Vatican has not
released the general, where he would be apprehended by U.S. troops
that ring the embassy.
   The Vatican also insists that Panama has not made a formal
request for custody of Noriega.
   But Vatican officials have indicated they are eager to see the
general leave.
   On Sunday, Attorney General Rogelio Cruz said Panama would file
murder charges against the ousted dictator in connection with the
alleged execution of 10 officers who tried to oust Noriega in a
botched coup Oct. 3.
   The filing of murder charges in Panama could give the Vatican
grounds to turn him out and resolve the diplomatic stalemate.
   If Noriega did emerge from the embassy, McGrath said, ``Panama
would not take him to avoid the question of whether to extradite or
not to extradite.''
   Many countries, including Panama, have laws against extraditing
their own citizens abroad.
   American officials were considering dusting off a 1904 treaty
that set forth extradition rights in the former Panama Canal Zone,
a 10-mile-wide strip of territory along the canal that was U.S.
territory.
   The zone reverted to Panama in 1979 under the 1977 Panama Canal
Treaties, which call for control of the waterway to be turned over
to Panama at the turn of the century.
   In another step in the transfer process, a Panamanian became the
top administrator of the waterway on Monday for the first time in
the 75-year history of the canal.
   Fernando Manfredo, a 62-year-old economist who has been deputy
administrator of the Panama Canal Commission for 10 years, became
acting administrator.
   Bush rejected Noriega's candidate and named Manfredo to the post
well before the invasion. The Endara government, in power since
Dec. 20, was not able to propose its own candidate by the Jan. 1
deadline set in the treaties.

<HEAD>Poll Says 51 Percent of Soviets Prefer Capitalism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Monday that more than half the
Soviet citizens who responded to a recent Japanese poll said they
preferred capitalism to socialism, and America ranked first among
their favorite foreign nations.
   The poll was conducted simultaneously in the Soviet Union, the
United States and Japan. It compared opinions in the three nations
on a range of issues, the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said.
   According to the poll, 72 percent of Americans, 60 percent of
Soviet citizens and 41 percent of Japanese said they supported
their government.
   The government in Japan imposed a new sales tax last April and
was hit by bribery and sex scandals the past year.
   Americans also expressed the most happiness with their present
lifestyles, with 92 percent saying they were satisfied, compared
with 73 percent of Japanese and 26 percent of Soviets, the
newspaper said.
   The Soviets were asked if they believed capitalism or socialism
was superior. Fifty-one percent picked capitalism, 32 percent said
socialism and 17 percent said they didn't know, Mainichi Shimbun
reported.
   People polled in each nation were asked their favorite and
least-favorite foreign countries. The most popular nation in Japan
was the United States, favored by 30 percent of respondents,
followed by Switzerland, with 10 percent, and Australia, with 8
percent. The Soviet Union ranked 10th, with less than 1 percent of
positive replies.
   Among Soviet respondents, the United States also placed first,
with 32 percent, followed by Japan with 10.9 percent and Israel
with 10.3 percent. The most popular Communist nation, China, ranked
10th with 2 percent.
   Eighteen percent of Americans picked Canada as their favorite
foreign country. Next was Britain with 15 percent, with Japan a
distant third at 2 percent.
   The Soviet Union was the least-favorite nation of the Japanese
respondents, with 25 percent of the negative replies, while the
United States tied for third place with 4 percent.
   Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union stationed troops for 10
years, ranked as the Soviets' most disliked nation with 9.5
percent, while the largest number of Americans _ 16 percent _
picked the Soviet Union.
   Would nuclear war occur in their lifetime? Ten percent of the
Japanese polled thought it would; 14 percent in the United States,
and 16 percent in the Soviet Union, the newspaper said.
   The survey was conducted by telephone from Nov. 28 to Dec. 12
and included 4,001 Japanese, 3,015 Americans and 2,970 Soviets
selected randomly, the newspaper said. NTT Telemarketing Co.
conducted the polls in the United States and Japan, and those
questioned were 20 years or older. The Soviet Sociology Academy's
survey center conducted the survey in the Soviet Union, including
both Communist Party and non-party members who were at least 18
years old.
   The newspaper provide no margin of error.

   To the relief of streetsweepers, Rome residents
showed again on New Year they have all but given up the custom of
breaking old furniture and hurling the debris, along with the
garbage, out windows and off balconies.
   The custom signified throwing out old problems in hopes of
better times.
   One tradition that remained was diving off Cavour Bridge for a
New Year's Day swim and three Roman men braved the chilly Tiber to
do just that.
   Temperatures dipped to 25 degrees overnight, a relief to
thousands of Roman women who parade in their furs on holiday
afternoons whether it's cold or not.
   Southern Italian cities kept the dubious distinction of most
fireworks injuries in New Year's festivities that stretched into
Monday morning.
   Two people were killed and 779 were reported injured in
accidents blamed on fireworks or firing off pistols in New Year's
Eve celebrations, police said.
   A 47-year-old man in a small town in Puglia, the heel of
boot-shaped Italy, was killed when a bullet fired in the street
struck him in the shoulder blade, the Italian news agency AGI
reported. The man was inside a house, toasting the New Year with
friends, when hit.
   An 11-year-old boy playing with fireworks on the beach of
Ischia, an island off Naples, died Monday of wounds suffered when
the device went off in his hands.
   New Year's Eve celebrants playing bridge at a club in Messina,
Sicily, were robbed of cash, furs and jewelry worth $180,000 by
five masked bandits armed with pistols and shotguns, AGI quoted
police as reporting.

   Yugoslavia introduced a new dinar
Monday freely convertible to Western currencies and worth 10,000
old dinars, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   The new dinar was fixed at seven to one West German mark, and
its introduction is part of government attempts to battle inflation
that exceeded 2,600 percent last year, said Tanjug.
   A mark is worth about 84 cents.
   Tanjug said a government austerity program also includes a wage

   The new government Monday abolished
the death penalty and the hated secret police, as Romanians
celebrated their first non-Communist New Year's Day in more than
four decades.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu promised political pluralism and a
shorter workweek, re-established private ownership of land and
suspended wasteful construction projects in progress under toppled
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Romanian Radio reported no incidents of sniper fire or clashes
between the army and die-hard secret police loyal to Ceausescu,
indicating a return to peace following two weeks of unrest that
claimed thousands of lives.
   People dressed in black lighted candles in central Romana Square
for their relatives and friends who died in the revolution.
   Another death in Bucharest was that Monday of Deputy Foreign
Minister Cornelieu Bogdan, 68, who was ambassador to the United
States under the communist regime, relatives in Washington
reported. They said he had a history of heart trouble and was
believed to have died of an aneurysm at work.
   Just Sunday, Bogdan told reporters in Bucharest, ``The Communist
Party is dead'' and no danger existed of Communists returning to
undisputed power here.
   In a New Year's address carried by the official news agency
Agerpres, Iliescu announced the end to capital punishment, saying
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, ``were the last persons who deserved
this fate.''
   The Ceausescus were found guilty of ``genocide'' during their
24-year rule, and were executed on Dec. 25.
   Iliescu also re-established the right to own private property,
with farmers again permitted to own about an acre of land
surrounding their houses. He said farmers could lease more land,
with its yield also sold on the private market. In the past, the
state was the only buyer.
   He said the workweek would be reduced from six days to five, and
he reiterated the government's commitment to introducing multiparty
democracy after more than four decades of Communist rule.
   Iliescu's interim governing council of the National Salvation
Front also signed a decree Monday guaranteeing the right to
repatriation of Romanian citizens living abroad, Agerpres reported.
   The news agency said the decree gave former exiles priority in
buying housing with hard currency and allowed them to bring home
goods bought abroad without paying duty.
   Iliescu also formally announced the abolition of Securitate, the
secret police, Romanian radio reported.
   Hundreds of armed special police were still believed at large
Monday, despite orders last week by the provisional government to
surrender themselves and their weapons.
   Prime Minister Petre Roman, in an interview broadcast Monday on
Romanian television, said the government's priorities before
planned elections in April were ``liberalization and changing
laws.''
   Roman also dismissed suggestions by FR3, a French television
station, that the revolution had been planned by leading dissidents.
   He said the uprising ``was a spontaneous movement and a popular
mass movement against the dictatorship.''
   The announced dismantling of Securitate was preceded by the
detention of the agency's former head, Gen. Iulian Vlad, along with
three ranking members of the ministry controlling the police,
Agerpres reported.
   It did not specify what charges, if any, the four face.
   Maj Ihai Lupoi, the new minister of tourism, told a news
conference, ``In the first days, General Vlad worked with the
revolution. After four or five days he was arrested for reasons I
don't know.''
   Lupoi also said Ceausescu's villa and its secret tunnels might
be opened to tourists.
   The death toll from the revolution's two turbulent weeks remains
uncertain.
   One Western diplomat said he had information that indicated
about 7,000 people had died. ``Our best estimate is nowhere near
what the government says,'' he said. Estimates at one point reached
as high as 80,000.
   At least six new political parties have emerged since Ceausescu
was overthrown Dec. 22 by a nation outraged over the massacre by
security forces of hundreds of people in the western city of
Timisoara participating in an anti-Ceausescu protest.
   Iliescu is a former Communist Party secretary who fell out of
favor with Ceausescu for speaking his mind but has the political
experience that dissident intellectuals and other former opposition
figures lack.
   His address comes ahead of the expected arrival in Bucharest
Thursday of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   A Western diplomat said Iliescu might discuss with Shevardnadze
the possiblity of allowing free travel across the Soviet-Romanian
border in Moldavia, a territory partly annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1940.
   Iliescu also made available public agricultural production
figures according to which the year's cereal production amounted to
16.9 million tons, instead of 60 million tons claimed by Ceausescu.
Other totals also were well below claimed amounts.
   To pay off the country's foreign debt, Ceausescu had in recent
years exported Romania's best agricultural products while forcing
rationing upon his people. The new government is now opening
warehouses and making those items available to Romanians.

   The government, faced with
economic chaos and possible social unrest, Monday night announced
measures intended to prop up the national currency, reduce high
interest rates and stabilize real wages.
   In a nationwide address broadcast, Economy Minister Antonio
Gonzalez said the amount of australs _ the national currency _ in
circulation would be limited in the hopes of preventing Argentines
from buying U.S. dollars and further diluting the austral's value.
   Investors whose certificates of deposit come due beginning
Wednesday _ Tuesday is a bank holiday _ will be paid up to 1
million australs ($500) in cash and will have to accept long-term
bonds for the balance, Gonzalez said.
   Also, the Central Bank will print only enough australs to cover
government salaries, pensions and normal business expenses, he said.
   ``The price of the dollar should go down,'' Gonzalez said. ``The
reason for this affirmation is very simple: there are going to be
very few australs in circulation.''
   Last Thursday, the final business day of 1989, the austral slid
to 1,950 to the dollar, indicating a lack of public confidence in
the government's latest economic program. In February the rate was
17-1, and 1,000-1 last month.
   As banks struggled to retain funds, interest rates rose to 600
percent a month. Stores, anticipating inflation, marked up prices
drastically or closed in the face of panic buying by shoppers
trying to stock up on goods they feared they later would not be
able to afford.
   On Saturday, the head of the armed forces, Gen. Isidro Caceres,
warned that the economic problems could result in ``states of
anarchy.'' However, he publicly endorsed President Carlos Menem, in
office since July.
   On Monday, also a national holiday, the director of an
influential group of small businessmen said they might not open
their 1 million stores nationwide on Tuesday.
   Juan Carlos Lightowler Stahlberg, director of the Board of
Merchant Business Activities, said before Gonzalez' address,
``Unfortunately ... every operation in cash (now) is done at a
loss'' because inflation makes it impossible to estimate prices to
charge enough to be able to restock.
   The latest plunge in value of the austral, which contributed to
the resignations of one economy minister and two Central Bank
presidents, is ``totally unjustified and the result of collective
hysteria,'' Gonzalez said.
   However, exchange and interest rates will continue to be set by
market forces, he said.
   Wages and prices also will be set by market forces and not by
government guidelines ``because we are convinced that controls
don't work in any country in the world.''
   The economy minister denied the U.S. dollar would be used as a
type of alternate currency, as local newspapers and analysts
predicted.
   With inflation estimated at 50 percent for December and 5,000
percent for 1989, Gonzalez admitted the economy ``every day is more
`dollarized''' in terms`of prices.
   Real wages have contracted by about 60 percent this year, and he
said savings in australs have been ``pulverized'' by devaluations
totaling 99 percent since February.

   Unlike his onetime East European
partners in the Soviet bloc who plan democratic reforms in 1990,
Vietnam's Communist Party leader Nguyen Van Linh cited ``building
socialism'' as a New Year's resolution.
   In a New Year's message carried by Voice of Vietnam radio, he
urged Vietnamese to follow the example of Ho Chi Minh, the late
revolutionary leader whose 100th birthday will be celebrated in
1990.
   ``This is the best way for every one of us to rise up to the
level of the task entrusted by history to our entire party and
people _ to build a socialist society with its objective and motive
being of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' Linh said.
   Linh has introduced some economic reforms and a degree of
political liberalization since late 1986, but Hanoi's leaders have
refused to consider a multiparty system.
   Remaining economic problems in Vietnam include unemployment,
poor management skills and an outdated infrastructure.
   Linh urged all citizens and party members to ``conduct
themselves in an exemplary fashion in study and action in keeping
with Uncle Ho's thoughts, virtues, and work style.''

   The first uninjured American combat troops to
leave Panama arrived Monday at Kelly Air Force Base here for a
layover before returning to their home base at Fort Ord in
California.
   Kelly spokeswoman Phoebe Brown said 56 soldiers arrived on a
C-141 transport and were scheduled to leave for Monterrey, Calif.,
at 5 a.m. Tuesday.
   Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super said the troops were from
the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord. He said a second plane
carrying troops was due in at Kelley, but he was uncertain when.
Ms. Brown said she did not know anything about a second plane of
returning troops flying to the base.
   ``Their military mission is finished. It's just a continued
tailoring of the military force in Panama as the need for combat
troops is diminished,'' Super said. ``The growing mission down
there now is for nation-building and civil affairs.''
   President Bush on Monday expressed hope that the remaining U.S.
soldiers in Panama could leave ``as soon as possible,'' the White
House said.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater`told reporters
that the returning units consisted of 68 soldiers and the other of
73 GIs.
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said ``we want them all to come home as soon as possible''
except for the 12,000 that are permanently assigned to Panama. An
additional 14,000 were sent in as part of the December invasion.
   Fitzwater said the remaining troops in Panama most likely would
leave ``on a piecemeal basis'' but offered no time frame.
   Fitzwater's remarks were telephoned to Washington from Air Force
One while the president and First Lady Barbara Bush were en route
to the nation's capital from Alabama. They stopped there for bass
fishing following a six-day vacation.

   The American Civil Liberties Union will
represent the Ku Klux Klan in its lawsuit challenging a city's
denial of a parade permit near the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday,
ACLU officialos said.
   ``I don't believe what the Klan stands for, but that doesn't
give the city of Pulaski the right to restrict their right to
peacefully demonstrate,'' attorney George Barrett said Sunday.
   ``If you can do it to the Klan today, you can do it to a group
with opposite views tomorrow,'' said Barrett, who said he plans to
handle the Klan's lawsuit for the ACLU.
   The lawsuitl expected to be filed this week, will contend
Pulaski's mayor and aldermen are violating the Klan's First
Amendment right to freedom of assembly.
   The board passed an ordinance that restricts parade permits to
one a month, and the January permit has already been granted to
another group, Giles Countians United.
   The Giles Countians United, which organized a boycott of a
recent white supremacists march in Pulaski, has scheduled a
``brotherhood parade'' Jan. 13.
   The Klan had sought a permit for Jan. 13 or Jan. 20; the
Saturdays on either side of the Jan. 15 King holiday.
   A special session of the Pulaski city board is scheduled
Wednesday to discuss a new request by the Klan to march on the
morning of Jan. 13, mayor Hal Stewart`said.
   Pulaski, the post-Civil War birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan, has
been the scene of marches by racist groups for the past several
years. Last January, Klan members and skinheads gathered on the
courthouse square to protest the federal holiday honoring civil
rights leader King.
   Businesses closed shop Oct. 7 to protest a rally by members of
the Aryan Nations who said they were honoring the birthday of Sam
Davis, a Confederate spy who was hanged for refusing to give
information to Union soldiers.

   Government plans to charge Manuel
Antonio Noriega with murder and other common crimes may break a
week-old deadlock between Washington and the Vatican over custody
of the deposed strongman.
   President Bush says he wants Noriega behind bars in the United
States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. Panama's
President Guillermo Endara, sworn as U.S. troops invaded to oust
Noriega, has indicated he's not too eager to have the military
ruler turned asylum-seeker remain in Panama.
   But the Vatican, in whose embassy Noriega sought sanctuary Dec.
24 and greeted the New Year, has made it clear it is reluctant to
turn out the general until all the niceties of diplomacy and
international law are fulfilled.
   Up to now, the main stumbling block has been the Vatican's
insistence that it cannot hand over Noriega to the United States,
which it considers an ``occupying power'' in Panama.
   It says it considers its embassy accredited to deal only with
the Panamanian government, which it insists has not made a formal
request for custody of Noriega.

   President Bush, after a bedside tribute to the
``gutsy, courageous, young'' soldiers wounded in Panama, says it is
``only fair and right'' that dictator Manuel Noriega be brought to
justice in the United States.
   Bush, after spending New Year's Eve in the privacy of his hotel
suite in his adopted hometown, today winds up his Christmas
vacation bass fishing near Montgomery, Ala., before flying home to
the White House.
   Bush, an avid angler, was to cast for bass at a private 55-acre
lake in Pintlala, Ala., owned by pal Ray Scott Jr., publisher of
Bassmaster Magazine.
   Bush and wife Barbara were moved to tears Sunday as they visited
each of the 44 servicemen still hospitalized at two military
hospitals in San Antonio, Texas.
   ``They're gutsy, courageous young men,'' said Bush, who praised
the Panama invasion as ``a superb operation.'' He added, ``there
should be no second-guessing.''
   On continuing efforts to pry Noriega out of the Vatican embassy
in Panama City, where he has been holed up since Dec. 24, Bush
said, ``there's a lot going on and discussions about what'll take
place.''
   ``We want him brought to justice. It's only fair and right to
these kids lying here ... and I'm determined to see that that
happens,'' Bush told reporters.

   Workers will pay higher payroll taxes and
retirees will get bigger Social Security checks in the new year as
a long-scheduled tax increase kicks in and a cost-of-living
adjustment boosts retirement benefits.
   The payroll tax rises from 7.51 percent in 1989 to 7.65 percent
in 1990, meaning employees will pay $765 to Social Security for
each $10,000 of earnings subject to the tax, $14 more than in 1989.
   The increase has been in the cards since 1977, when Congress
approved a plan to help keep the giant retirement program on sound
financial footing that included the tax jump in 1990.
   Congress subsequently enacted a bailout package in 1983 that
boosted the payroll tax from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent in 1988,
without changing the 7.65 rate that already was planned for 1990.
   The new year also means workers will start paying Social
Security taxes on a bigger share of their earnings. The payroll tax
applies to income of up to $51,300 in 1990, up from $48,000 in 1989.
   The combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of Social Security taxes
deducted will jump by $320 to $3,924 for a worker who earns $51,300
or more. Employers match their workers' contributions.

a dazzling New Year's Eve show when it roared into space after nine

   Martin Marietta Corp. entered the commercial launch business as
the 155-foot-tall booster etched a fiery path in a star-filled sky.
   More than three hours after the 7:07 p.m. launch, officials
reported the two satellites had been deployed properly.
   Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch was delayed once by a
technical problem and eight times by strong, high altitude winds.
The wind didn't pose a problem Sunday night and the countdown
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff.
   The most powerful U.S. commercial rocket carried into space the
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites.
   JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network,
providing telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data
services. It is owned by the Japanese Communications Satellite Co.
   Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for
communicating with land, sea and air forces.

   Officials announced tentative agreement Monday

office of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Trumka said it is unclear when miners will return to work, but
he said the agreement would be placed before the rank and file for
ratification within eight to 10 days.
   Terms were not disclosed immediately. Both sides called it ``a
victory for collective bargaining'' but said they want striking

   Bus fares and gasoline doubled and
electricity quadrupled in price Monday under a radical plan by the
non-Communist government to transform Poland's centrally planned
economy to capitalism.
   Poles' fears of looming price increases were confirmed Monday,
and Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledged hardships in
coming months but stressed the increases were needed to halt
Poland's 900 percent inflation to end its economic decline.
   ``There are no solutions devoid of risk,'' the official news
agency PAP quoted him as saying. ``Above all, I would like to
stress that despite the dangers and challenges, we stand before a
unique chance and it depends on us how we take advantage of it.''
   The far-reaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally
directed economy run by the Communists during their four-decade
rule. But there is concern that the economic shock will be too much
for Poles, who earn an average monthly wage of 350,000 zlotys ($37).

   Chinese authorities, in internal documents and closed meetings,
reportedly blame Gorbachev and his ``new thinking'' diplomacy for
unleashing the forces that have ended 40 years of Communist
dominance in East Europe.
   Diplomatic sources say China was being careful to avoid a public
break with the Soviet Union and other fast-changing socialist
states by stressing that China never interferes in the internal
affairs of other nations.
   The sources say open disapproval of the upheavals in East Europe
would show the Chinese people how isolated their hard-line leaders
have become from the popular reforms sweeping the socialist world.

   Drug Enforcement Administrator John C. Lawn
generally keeps a low profile. He speaks in a quiet, husky voice as
he guides the actions of agents throughout the world, trying to
keep them safe in the field and supported in Washington.
   But when a miniseries on the 1985 murder in Mexico of DEA agent
Enrique ``Kiki'' Camerena airs on NBC in January, he could become
something of a national hero.
   The miniseries depicts Lawn tangling with Mexican officials who
stonewall efforts to find Camarena and his killers, and going
public to criticize those officials over the objections of Reagan
administration officials.
   At the conclusion of a National Archives screening, a choked-up
Lawn told the audience of about 100 DEA and Mexican Embassy
officials that it was ``an extraordinary piece of work.''

   An ``electronic peephole'' that displays the
telephone number of incoming calls is worrying defenders of privacy
rights and stirring concern on Capitol Hill.
   But others say the new gadget will short-circuit nuisance calls
and will be a boon to law enforcement.
   The new service is known as Automatic Number Identification, or
Caller ID, and is being offered for about $6.50 a month plus
another $60 to $80 for a small viewing device that flashes an
incoming number before the phone is answered.
   Businesses love it. But privacy advocates say it's Big Brother
and will lead to ``phone prefix discrimination'' and other social
ills as people selectively decide what calls to answer or to ignore.

   No cover needed, President Bush said of his
New Year's vacation _ he'd earned it with hard work. Even so,
presidents and their image-makers always are at pains to point out
the press of daily duty that travels with them.
   So it was as Bush took his customary end-of-the-year break in
Texas, a holiday that ended Monday night. He said there had been no
reason to change it because of U.S. intervention in Panama. Bush
spent New Year's weekend in Houston, flying to San Antonio on
Sunday to visit wounded servicemen at two military hospitals.
   ``Things have gone well. It's winding down,'' he had said as his
vacation began last Wednesday. ``I am in close touch by _ very
close touch _ by telephone, by secure links.
   ``And the secretary of state is here, and we have some important
things to go over. So I _ it never occurred to me,'' he told a
questioner at an airport news conference.
   ``Now, if the matter were still going and there was a lot of
fighting and Noriega was not in custody, it would have been
different. But I _ look, I don't make any cover.
   ``I'm going to be enjoying myself, and I think the American
people understand that. And I think I've worked pretty hard all
year long, so I'll keep on this path, and I hope it's correct.''
   Then Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III went fishing
and hunted quail, as they have for 20 years, at the ranch of a
mutual friend near Beeville, Texas.
   Out of town and off work, but never out of touch, his spokesman
said. This administration, like its predecessors, misses no
opportunity to point out the rigors of the job and the way they can
be handled far from Washington, on business or pleasure.
   ``He receives intelligence briefings every morning and, of
course, a continual stream of paperwork that includes reports from
the State Department and the Pentagon and other agencies of
government,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president also ... has a secure telephone system there at
the ranch, and is able to make telephone calls on a secure basis to
leaders around the world and other members of the administration.
He has with him his military aide and his personal aide who also
maintain contact with various officials of government.
   ``We always take the position that the presidency goes with the
president, but be that as it may, certainly the president is able
to respond to any international situation at any time,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Just then, a telephone rang, interrupting his briefing.
   ``And there he is now,'' Fitzwater cracked. ``Tell him I`m
busy.''
   Bush spent his summer vacation, 20 days of it, at Kennebunkport,
Maine, displaying his way of relaxing at top speed. He went
fishing, golfing, jogging, boating, played tennis, played ball,
dined out, all in a sort of semi-public summer break that
contrasted sharply with the solitude some presidents have sought.
   Ronald Reagan spent the equivalent of 11 months in the isolation
of his Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch during the eight years he was
president.
   The vacationing Bush is more public and more active. But he was
out of the public eye and 60 miles from his traveling staff
entourage during his three days at the Lazy F Ranch. His hunting
days began at about 6 a.m., with written intelligence briefings.
Before 9, he and Baker were out after quail, even on a foggy Texas
morning.
   ``This man has eyes that can see through steel girders, let
alone fog,'' Fitzwater joked.
   ``Did he hit any?''
   The question went unanswered.
   The White House has been sticking to announced schedules, with
adjustments but with no major changes or cancellations because of
the Panama situation, as if to play down any air of crisis because
of the military operation.
   With one big break for the administration, it worked. Just when
the operation seemed to be facing unanticipated resistance, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the ousted military boss, emerged from
hiding and took refuge at the Vatican embassy.
   But the business-and-holiday-as-usual schedule did produce one
bad televised scene. Bush, about to leave for a Camp David
Christmas weekend, bantered with reporters following a White House
press conference. Meanwhile, split TV screens showed the
flag-draped coffins of American servicemen arriving home from
Panama.
