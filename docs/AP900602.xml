   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
discussed chemical weapons, nuclear arms and trade. Now it's time to
talk about something really important _ Spam.
   Among the 145 business and farm leaders invited to meet with
Gorbachev in Minneapolis on Sunday is Richard L. Knowlton, chief
executive officer of Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., which makes the spiced
luncheon meat in a can.
   ``We'll talk about Spam,'' Knowlton said Friday. ``I will be
taking a can of Spam along for him.
   ``Khrushchev's memoirs give a lot of credit to Spam for helping
the Russians get through World War II,'' the executive noted.
   Knowlton and the others on the list hope to scout new markets for
their products and to offer advice for the Soviet Union's transition
to a market economy.
   The list, originally planned to include about 50 people, tripled
so that a wider variety of businesses could be included, said Ray
Bohn, a spokesman for Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   The list includes such nationally known executives as Chrysler
Corp.'s Lee Iacocca, as well as small-town Minnesotans like William
Marvin of Warroad, population 1,000.
   ``I have no idea why I was included,'' said Marvin, chairman and
CEO of Marvin Windows in the northern Minnesota town. ``I thought
somebody had made a mistake.''
   Another invitee, Minnesota Vikings General Manager Mike Lynn,
wants to seek Gorbachev's help in taking football to the Soviet
Union.
   Said Lynn: ``We would like to be the first team to play in
Russia.''

   The Joffrey Ballet, which had canceled a national
tour because of money problems, announced Friday that donors had
stepped forward to fund the planned performances.
   The company will perform at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A.,
Charleston, S.C., June 7 to 9; Wolf Trap Farm Park, Vienna, Va.,
June 19 to 21, and Artpark, Lewiston, N.Y., June 26 to June 1.
   Joffrey dancers also will appear on the June 18 opening night of
the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in a tribute
to Robert Joffrey.
   The announcement reverses a decision this week by the ballet
company's board to cancel the tour because of a lack of funds.
   Nigel Redden, Spoleto's general manager, said that the festival
has offered the Joffrey more money than was contracted plus free
assistance in lighting and wardrobe. Philip Morris Companies Inc.
and the Harkness Foundation for Dance have contributed an
undisclosed sum of money. The College of Charleston has arranged
free dormitory rooms for the troupe.
   Helping financially with the other engagements are the Charles
and Ruth Levy Foundation, Barbara and David Kipper and Mrs. Jouett
Shouse.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev anticipated a more relaxed round of summit talks at the
Camp David presidential retreat today after sealing an array of
superpower agreements on long-range nuclear weapons, chemical arms
and - surprisingly - trade.
   ``The world has waited long enough, the Cold War must end,''
declared Bush at an elaborate signing ceremony Friday in the ornate
East Room of the White House.
   At a mid-summit scene framed by Soviet and American flags,
Gorbachev said the achievements represent ``an event of momentous
importance not only for our two countries but for the world.''
   Agreements aside, the two men laid out an ambitious negotiating
agenda for the balance of the year, and success could mean another
summit or perhaps two. They expressed the hope they could seal the
formal treaty on long-range nuclear weapons, and agree to a
reduction in conventional forces in Europe.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III also said both sides had
made a commitment to a follow-up round of arms control talks to
cover cuts in heavy missiles with multiple warheads.
   Summit disagreements persisted over German unification and
Lithuania, although Baker said talks had produced an ``understanding
of each other's concerns.''
   Bush and Gorbachev, with one more full day of bargaining on their
summit agenda, were heading for the Camp David compound in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. Said Gorbachev: ``There's a lot of
fresh air there and I think we'll work and complete our
discussions.''
   Baker said the two presidents would discuss regional conflicts
during the day, presumably including Afghanistan, and well as talk
about Perestroika and the ``prospects for improved economic'' ties
between the United States and Soviet Union.
   The summit ends on Sunday with a joint news conference. Gorbachev
is making stops in Minnesota and California on his way home. He is
expected to meet with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo while on
the West Coast in an apparent bid to improve relations with a key
potential trading partner.
   Bush and Gorbachev did their work as their wives flew to Boston
for the day. Together, Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev attended
commencement ceremonies at Wellesley College before taking front-row
seats at the White House signing ceremony and then joining their
husbands and aides for dinner at the Soviet embassy.
   In his toast, Bush said ``Because Americans are so free to dream,
we feel a special kinship with those who dream of being free. And
today that kinship is quickly becoming a shared spirit, a spirit
that inspires millions here in our nation, in your own and around
the world.'
   Gorbachev, for his part, paid a special salute to Bush for
signing the trade agreement. He said it ``takes on special relevance
since it has been concluded at a time of a dramatic change of
direction in the Soviet economy which is crucial for the future of
perestroika.''
   Roast duck, suckling pig and apple puff pastry were on the menu.
   The trade pact was the surprise of Friday's summitry - a day of
intense behind the scenes negotiations.
   At one point, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said snags
had developed in the framework to cut long-range nuclear weapons by
up to 35 percent, but Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze went back to work and
nailed down the framework expected to form the basis for a formal
treaty in the future.
   Gorbachev pressed his case for a trade agreement forcefully, and
told congressional leaders he was hoping for a gesture that would
bolster his troubled drive to institute a free-market economy back
home.
   ``I think he feels if he doesn't get it he's going home empty
handed,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, one of several
congressional officials who heard Gorbachev's request.
   The Soviets also balked at signing an agreement to purchase U.S.
grain _ a deal favored by American farmers _ unless the broader
trade pact was approved.
   In the end, it, too, received signatures. The deal commits the
Soviets to buy at least 10 million tons annually, starting next
year, of U.S. wheat, feed grains and soybeans. That is an increase
of one million tons annually from the current agreement.
   Gorbachev wanted the broader treaty pact because it will
facilitate investment in the Soviet Union by American companies.
   The trade agreement also is a step toward granting
most-favored-nation status to Moscow, providing the lowest possible
tariffs on Soviet goods. Baker said the pact would not be sent to
Congress until the Soviets approved liberalized emigration
legislation.
   There was no mention at the signing ceremony of any condition
that the Kremlin lessen its economic restrictions on the breakaway
Soviet Republic of Lithuania. That dismayed Lithuanian Americans
demonstrating across the street. Arunas Martinonis of Boston said
Bush ``is letting democracy and independence down.''
   Also unmentioned at the signing ceremony was Germany. The two
presidents agreed on Thursday they would be unable for the duration
of the summit to resolve their disputes over the military shape of a
unified Germany, but Baker and Shevardnadze will go back to work on
that issue next week.
   Heralding the pact to cut stockpiles of poison gas, Bush said,
``Let this landmark agreement quickly lead to a global ban on
chemical weapons.'' Negotiations are under way among 40 nations for
a worldwide treaty.
   Other agreements signed by the two sides covered verification of
nuclear test limits signed in the 1970s, a pact on atomic energy
cooperation and one covering maritime transportation. Other topics
covered include reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow and the first government-to-government
agreement to increase student exchanges between the two countries.

   President Bush gave Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev the economic prize he sought from the summit _ a signed
trade agreement _ but whether the accord will ever take effect is
far from certain.
   For one thing, Bush set conditions on whether he will even submit
the document to Congress for ratification.
   And once that hurdle is cleared, members of Congress were warning
that they are in no mood to approve the accord unless Gorbachev
eases his economic blockade of independence-minded Lithuania.
   ``The United States will not give new trade benefits while the
Soviet noose continues to strangle Lithuania,'' said Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., an outspoken backer of the breakaway Baltic
republic.
   The administration had tried on its own to pressure Gorbachev to
make concessions on Lithuania before it signed the trade agreement,
but in the end Bush decided not to send Gorbachev back to Moscow
empty-handed.
   Gorbachev, struggling at home with empty store shelves and a
variety of economic ills, had made the trade agreement an important
symbol of his ability to improve economic relations with the West.
   The trade agreement is a necessary condition for lowering tariffs
on Soviet products sold in the United States, levies that are
currently as high as 10 times the rate imposed on goods from nations
which enjoy the most-favored-nation trade status.
   American business groups had lobbied for approval of the trade
agreement because the pact contains a variety of provisions aimed at
expanding opportunities for U.S. companies in the Soviet Union.
These provisions would make it easier for American companies to
establish joint ventures with Soviet companies, a key goal of
Gorbachev's efforts to attract Western expertise.
   The outcome of the trade treaty was in doubt throughout a lengthy
day of bargaining Friday. Also signed was a five-year grain
agreement which had become a bargaining chip in the battle over
trade.
   An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that intense debate was taking place on the grain and trade
proposals with the Soviets threatening to block the grain agreement
_ advantageous to U.S. farmers _ if they didn't get the trade pact
they sought.
   Referring to American reaction to the Soviet crackdown on
Lithuanian independence efforts, Gorbachev told the White House
audience, ``I am pleased to note that the turbulent developments in
recent months after (the summit at) Malta have not led us astray
from the goals that we set together.''
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III, briefing reporters
later, acknowledged that the required passage of the trade agreement
by Congress will be difficult unless Gorbachev starts a new dialogue
with Lithuanian leaders.
   Baker also said that the trade agreement will not be sent to
Congress for ratification until the Soviet legislature passes an
emigration law allowing more liberal travel abroad.
   Soviet officials said approval of the emigration measure will not
be a problem although its final passage by the Supreme Soviet has
been delayed several times.
   Once the Soviet legislature acts, the administration said that it
will send the trade agreement to Congress and will also submit a
presidential certification that the Soviets are eligible for the
most-favored-nation status.
   Both the trade agreement and the presidential declaration must be
approved by Congress for the lower tariffs to go into effect.
   Signaling a fight unless Gorbachev relents on Lithuania, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``The granting of
MFN status, in my mind, is in Mr. Gorbachev's hands. He can achieve
it with some rather modest changes in his policy toward the Baltic
states.''
   Lithuanian-American demonstrators massed outside the Soviet
embassy in Washington were clearly disappointed with Bush's decision.
   ``I think he's letting democracy and independence down,'' said
Arunas Martinonis of Boston. ``It really upsets me.''
   ``Bush should be stronger about Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,''
said Helen Zimavicus Carter, who drove 15 hours from her Chicago
home to join the protest. ``We're really shocked he doesn't stand up
for their rights.''
   In addition to the trade agreement, several other accords were
signed on Friday. These included:
   _Expanding commercial air travel between the United States and
the Soviet Union by adding four American and six Soviet cities to
current airliner routes.
   _A new 5-year atomic energy agreement to provide closer
cooperation in nuclear reactor safety, fusion energy and basic
atomic science.
   _A maritime transportation pact to make it easier for U.S. and
Soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one another's
country.
   _Opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow.
   _The first government-to-government agreement to increase student
exchanges between the two countries.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev topped an embassy dinner
of suckling pig and apple puff pastry with special thanks to
President Bush for a new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement he said would
hearten his hard-pressed countrymen.
   ``This agreement takes on special relevance since it has been
concluded at a time of a dramatic change of direction in the Soviet
economy which is crucial for the future of perestroika,'' Gorbachev
said at the dinner Friday night for Bush and his wife Barbara.
   ``I am convinced that the Soviet people will appreciate the fact
that the United States -- the President of the United States -- is
signing this agreement to normalize Soviet-American commercial
relations at this moment of special importance for our country,''
Gorbachev said, raising a glass of golden champagne in an toast to
his guest of honor.
   The dinner at the Soviet Embassy capped a second day of
negotiations, ending with the signing of several agreements between
the two countries. Included was the broad outline of a pact to slash
stockpiles of long-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush, in his toast, said he had learned that Gorbachev's home
town in the northern Caucasus was called Privolnoe, which he said
means spacious or free. That prompted a smile from the Soviet
president, and Bush apologized for his pronunciation.
   ``It reminded me of the new breeze, the new spirit of freedom
that we've seen sweep across Europe and around the globe,'' Bush
said.
   ``Because Americans are so free to dream, we feel a special
kinship with those who dream of being free. And today that kinship
is quickly becoming a shared spirit, a spirit that inspires millions
here in our nation, in your own and around the world.''
   The stately but fraying embassy, a few blocks from the White
House, was so wrapped in security that bulletproof frames of glass
were placed outside the street-side windows. Legions of security men
inside shoved reporters and photographers back into place when they
took a step beyond their assigned area or lingered for a backward
glance at the dinner hall.
   In deference to Soviet custom, Bush and the other Americans wore
dark business suits, rather than the tuxedos customary at such
formal dinners, and the women wore normal-length dresses.
   Mrs. Bush, seated at the head table between Gorbachev and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, wore a fuchsia knee-length
dress with a flouncy skirt.
   Raisa Gorbachev, seated between Vice President Dan Quayle and
Bush, was in black velvet.
   The menu included consomme with dumplings and mushroom cream,
roast duck, suckling pig, and baked sevruga-fish.
   Dessert was strawberry parfait, fruit and apple puff pastry.
   The Soviets served some of their country's best wine _ Tsinandali
Georgian white dry 1987 and Mookoozani Georgian red dry 1987, along
with the Soviets' golden champagne Zolotoye.
   On tap to entertain the 80 American and Soviet guests were Soviet
opera singer Zurab Sotkilava and pianist Mikhail Pletnev.
   Among those attending: Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas and his wife Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole; industrialist
Armand Hammer; Katharine Graham, chairman of the board of The
Washington Post Co.; Duayne Andreas, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
chairman; and Pepsico Inc. chairman Donald Kendall.

   Buckling up will soon bring an
unexpected bonus in the Netherlands, where police and a road safety
group plan to hand out compact disc players to drivers who obey the
seat belt law.
   The scheme to distribute 100 of the disc players among
law-abiding drivers has already come under fire.
   ``Wearing seat belts is the law and it's the police's job to see
the law is obeyed,'' the Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad said
Friday. ``What's next? A pocket calculator for those who obey the
speed limit?''
   Volunteers of the government-subsidized Road Safety Foundation
will join police patrols in this northern province next month and
present disc players at random to those found wearing seat belts,
foundation spokesman Anne van Schepen said.
   ``CD players are the `in' thing these days, so people will wear
their safety belts if that's what it takes to win one,'' van Schepen
said in an interview.
   Seat belts have been obligatory for all drivers and front-seat
passengers since 1971.
   But according to the foundation's statistics, only 77 percent of
Dutch drivers wear them on highways, and the figure drops to 63
percent in built-up areas.
   ``Every percentage point increase (in seat belt use) translates
into two to three fewer deaths each year,'' van Schepen said. Auto
accidents claim 1,400 lives each year in this nation of 14.6 million.

   Successful negotiations at the summit have
carried the United States and the Soviet Union closer to concluding
a treaty this year to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons
arsenals.
   But they remain far apart on another accord to withdraw tens of
thousands of troops and tanks in Europe.
   ``Serious substantive differences remain,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Friday night. But he added that both sides
are committed to resolving them by the end of the year.
   The key unsettled issue is the kind of aircraft to restrict.
Also, the Soviets are still reluctant to approve the reductions
without limits on German forces.
   A senior U.S. official, who declined identification, offered no
prediction of success, and said the United States would not yield on
its insistence on NATO membership for a unified Germany.
   The success in the strategic nuclear weapons field resulted from
six days of negotiations that began last Sunday at the State
Department.
   The U.S. and Soviet teams, headed by Under Secretary of State
Reginald Bartholomew and Deputy Prime Minister Viktor P. Karpov,
began with six key issues and settled two of them.
   As a result, the Soviets will be banned from putting their heavy,
ground-based SS-18 missiles on mobile launchers and the two sides
will be limited to 1,100 warheads on their mobile missiles.
   The ban will not affect the U.S. MX missile because it is not
considered a heavy missile, the U.S. official told reporters at a
briefing under rules that bars identifying him.
   Second, to ensure the treaty is carried out, each side will
conduct 12 kinds of on-site inspections, some of them on short
notice.
   Left unsettled _ and to be taken up by U.S. and Soviet
negotiators in Geneva _ are whether to limit flight tests of the
Soviet SS-18 missiles or to limit the Soviet Backfire bomber, and
the restrictions to be imposed on diverting banned weapons to third
countries.
   The sixth issue _ whether to ban intercontinental ballistic
missiles with multiple warheads _ will be considered in follow-on
negotiations after the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is concluded.
   ``The objectives of these negotiations will be to reduce further
the risk of outbreak of war, particularly nuclear war,'' the two
sides said in a joint statement.
   The new talks will begin ``without delay'' once the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (START) is signed, the statement said.
   Baker, who joined the negotiations on Friday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said ``we made workmanlike progress
over the full spectrum'' of arms issues.
   He referred also to completion of an agreement to end the
production of U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons.
   A senior American official disclosed, meanwhile, that earlier in
the week the Soviets had renewed their long-abandoned effort to
require limits on the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as Star Wars, in conjunction with cuts in offensive weapons.
   ``It was clearly an effort to change the status quo,' the
official said. ``It sort of slowed us up and we had to push them
back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ruling Uphold's State's Right to Regulate Disposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Friday abandoned an effort to revoke North Carolina's authority to
regulate hazardous waste, in a move some participants said could
have nationwide implications.
   The decision by Daniel W. McGovern, the EPA's regional
administrator in San Francisco, upholds the state's right to adopt
environmental laws that are more stringent than federal standards.
   It also could scuttle plans by Laidlaw Environmental Services
Co., formerly GSX Chemical Services Co., to build a massive,
regional hazardous-waste treatment facility near Laurinburg in
Scotland County.
   At issue in the case was whether a state law prevented
hazardous-waste treatment plants from operating in the state. In
essence, the law requires such plants to dilute each gallon of
treated wastewater with at least 1,000 gallons of water before
discharging into rivers and streams.
   GSX and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, an industry trade
group, asked the EPA to revoke the state's authority to manage
hazardous wastes after the General Assembly passed the law in 1987.
GSX contended that the law was arbitrary and was primarily aimed at
preventing the company from building its treatment plant in Scotland
County.
   State and local officials said the law was designed to protect
drinking water. The proposed GSX plant would have discharged as much
as 500,000 gallons of treated waste daily into the Lumber River, the
main water supply for Lumberton and much of Robeson County.
   The EPA held a series of hearings last year on issue.
   The final decision was left to the EPA official in San Francisco
because Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA's Southeastern regional
administrator in Atlanta, requested an independent decision-maker.
He was criticized as partial to the industries involved in the case.
   ``Hopefully, this will spell the end to the GSX proposal,'' said
the Rev. F. Mac Legerton, executive director of the Center for
Community Action, a Lumberton-based group that has fought the
proposed plant for six years.
   ``This was not just a not-in-my-own-backyard campaign,'' he said.
``The GSX proposal raised serious questions about massive discharges
into a very small river that remains a public drinking water
source.''
   The EPA decision has far-reaching implications, he said, because
it reaffirms a state's right to pass laws that are more stringent
than federal ones.
   The company has yet to decide if it will appeal, said spokesman
Roger E. Davis from Laidlaw's headquarters in Columbia, S.C.
   The decision doesn't rule out the plant, he said, but it would
force the company to build a much smaller version that might not be
economically feasible.
   ``If we can't get permits to build these facilities, there is
insufficient and inadequate treatment of the waste,'' he said.
``Since we're not going to shut off the production of hazardous
waste totally ... the environment is going to suffer.''

   NASA officials fear shuttle
Columbia's astronomy mission, already delayed until mid-June, may
not get off the ground until July because of a hydrogen leak.
   The agency plans to pump super-cold liquid hydrogen into
Columbia's external tank next Wednesday to duplicate temperature and
pressure conditions under which hydrogen leaked during fueling six
hours before the scheduled launch last Wednesday.
   ``That looks like the only way we can find it,'' Brewster Shaw,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deputy director
of shuttle operations, said Friday.
   But the agency was not ``terribly optimistic'' that the new test
will pinpoint a cause that can be fixed easily while the shuttle
remains at the launch pad, Shaw said.
   ``It's worth our while to do the test and find the leak. It's not
good to roll back (to the hangar) not knowing where the leak is,''
he said.
   The 36th shuttle mission already was two weeks behind schedule
because of cooling system repairs when the latest snag arose.
   Returning Columbia to the hangar would push the mission into July.
   NASA spent Thursday and Friday searching Columbia's engine
compartment for the hydrogen leak. Columbia's external tank was
drained of fuel and filled with non-flammable helium, but no leak
was found.
   Engineers are fairly certain the leak is in or near a 17-inch
valve in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from
the external tank to the shuttle's main engines, NASA spokesman
Bruce Buckingham said.
   Traces of helium were found Friday in a tight cavity between two
metal plates that connect the shuttle and its external tank. The
valve and pipe run through both plates.
   NASA planned today to circulate helium through the shuttle's
entire fuel system in preparation of Wednesday's tanking test.
   Shaw said Columbia's seven astronauts are ``anxious to go fly
their mission, but you can't go until your ride's ready. So they'll
just keep training and try and keep their spirits up.''
   Columbia's payload is a $150 million observatory called Astro
that will examine ultraviolet light and X-rays from extremely hot
stars, galaxies and other objects.
   Ten miles from where Columbia stood silent, NASA launched the
unmanned Delta rocket Friday. The rocket boosted into orbit a West
German observatory with a powerful X-ray telescope and a wide-field
camera capable of detecting extreme ultraviolet light.

   Naples shopowners agreed to hold down prices
on mineral water and the government rushed 50,000 bottles to the
city following a run on the product caused by contamination of the
local water supply.
   Tap water in several neighborhoods of Italy's third-largest city
has been brown and smelly since Tuesday, when a pipe broke and
sediment entered the water supply.
   The situation prompted an angry demonstration Thursday by about
200,000 people, who complained of poor water quality and shortages
even before the pipe break.
   Organizations of shopowners and distributors met Friday and
agreed to post a table of prices for mineral water in stores. The
price tripled to $2 a quart in some stores because of the run on
mineral water, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The Ministry of Health sent 50,000 bottles of mineral water to
Naples as well as two machines capable of purifying a total of about
26,000 a day of tap water, officials said. The Red Cross is to
distribute the water for free.

   Mohandas Gandhi is to be
honored by the town where he was thrown off a train nearly 100 years
ago because he wasn't white, a news report said.
   The Pietermaritzburg City Council in the eastern province of
Natal has approved in principle a plan to erect a plaque or statue
to honor Gandhi, the independent South African Press Association
said Friday.
   Gandhi, who came to South Africa as a 24-year-old lawyer in 1894,
led passive resistance actions against racist laws. He returned to
India in 1914, where he became a leader of the anti-British
independence movement.
   The proposed monument will say:
   ``During the night of 7th June 1893, a young Indian lawyer,
Mohandas Gandhi, was put off a train at Pietermartizburg Station
because he had refused to move out of a `European' coach.''
   The wording continues: ``Gandhi later described his feelings:
`What was my duty? I asked myself. Should I go back to India or
should I go forward with God as my helper and face what was in store
for me? I decided to stay and suffer. My active non-violence began
from that date.'''

<HEAD>Mongolia's Court Recognizes Five Opposition Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's Supreme Court has legalized all five
opposition parties formed since activists began demonstrating last
year for an end to the Communist monopoly on power, China's news
agency reported.
   Three of the five _ the Mongolian Democratic Party, the Social
Democrats and the National Progressive Party _ already had agreed to
join forces in fighting the ruling Communists in legislative
elections in July.
   The elections will be the first multi-party vote in Mongolian
history. The new legislature, or Great People's Hural, will in turn
elect a small standing legislature, and also will elect a new
president.
   The other two new parties are the Party of Free Labor, formed by
co-operative workers and owners, and the Green Party, concerned with
environmental issues.
   In a report Friday from the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator,
China's official Xinhua News Agency said the Supreme Court warned
the parties they may be dissolved if they do not strictly abide by
the constitution and other laws.
   The opposition groups and the Communist Party, formally called
the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, registered under a new
law approved in May that provides for the first time for the
existence of more than one party.
   The law requires each party to have at least 801 members. The
Communists, who have ruled for nearly seven decades, have about
90,000 members. The Mongolian Democratic Party, the second largest
group, said it has 7,200 members.
   The new law also bars parties from receiving state funds, but set
no deadline for the ruling party to stop receiving its state support.

   An observatory intended to probe
cosmic X-rays orbited 360 miles above Earth today after a trip into
space on an unmanned rocket.
   NASA launched the Delta rocket Friday as space shuttle Columbia
stood nearby, grounded until at least mid-June by an engine leak
that aborted an astronomy mission Wednesday.
   The space agency's Arthur Mackey said the Delta launch went off
without a glitch.
   ``They did a beautiful job, put it right where it was supposed to
be,'' he said after the spacecraft separated from its booster 43
minutes into the flight.
   The Delta rocket blasted into a partly cloudy sky at 5:47 p.m.
EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Liftoff was delayed about
12 minutes so a commercial airliner could move out of the launch
danger area.
   Confirmation that the spacecraft had separated and was safe in
its orbit was delayed by a brief loss of radio contact.
   The $273 million West German observatory, called Rosat,
originally was to have flown on a shuttle in 1987. It was redesigned
to fit into the Delta after the 1986 Challenger explosion meant
waiting until the mid-1990s for a shuttle ride.
   Astronomers expect Rosat to identify 100,000 sources of cosmic
X-rays, which cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and thus are
invisible from the ground. Only about 1,000 sources currently are
known to exist.
   ``This will be the fodder that scientists will use for years to
come to identify targets for future study,'' said NASA program
scientist Alan N. Bunner.
   The satellite consists of a powerful X-ray telescope and a
wide-field camera capable of detecting extreme ultraviolet light.
   After two months of instrument calibration, Rosat will begin a
six-month survey of celestial bodies that emit X-rays. It will be
the first full-sky survey by an imaging X-ray telescope.
   Following the survey, the observatory will spend the next year or
more making detailed observations of extremely hot stars, black
holes and remnants of supernovas, hot clouds produced by exploding
stars at the end of their lives.
   There will be 1,457 targets during the first six months alone,
said Joachim Truemper, Rosat program scientist for West Germany's
Federal Ministry for Research and Technology.
   Information will be transmitted to a ground station near Munich,
West Germany, then sent for analysis to centers in that country, the
United States and Britain.
   Rosat is 100 times more sensitive than the best X-ray observatory
to date, the so-called Einstein Observatory, which was placed in
orbit in 1978, Bunner said. Rosat will complement the work of the
X-ray telescope that is part of the Astro observatory waiting to be
launched from Columbia.
   NASA is picking up the $63 million cost of the McDonnell Douglas
Delta II rocket and related launch expenses. The United States also
has contributed $18 million toward the $273 million cost of Rosat.
Great Britain has chipped in $35 million.
   Rosat is short for Roentgen Satellite, named after German
scientist Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen, who discovered X-rays in 1895.

   A handful of Baptist ministers complained
that Pat Conroy's use of profanity in some of his best-selling
novels made him unsuitable as Furman University's commencement
speaker.
   Conroy, whose books include ``The Lords of Discipline,'' ``The
Prince of Tides'' and ``The Great Santini,'' was to give Furman's
commencement address today.
   The clergymen sent protest letters to John E. Johns, president of
the private college of 2,500 students founded by Baptists and
supported by the South Carolina Baptist Convention.
   ``I have nothing against Pat Conroy, but with Furman supposedly
being a Christian and a Southern Baptist school, I don't think he
should be receiving an honorary degree,'' said David Satterwhite, a
minister at Roebuck Baptist Church in Spartanburg.
   Johns said the college was honoring Conroy ``as an outstanding
novelist and script writer'' and would not withdraw the invitation.
   Conroy on Friday welcomed the ministers to his speech.
   ``It will probably be a far more interesting speech than the
sermons they give on Sunday,'' he said.

   A judge allowed actor Todd Bridges to remain
free on $25,000 bail pending his trial on an assault charge but
warned he would be sent to jail if he shows up in court under the
influence of drugs.
   ``There were two appearances when I suspected you were under the
influence of narcotics,'' Superior Court Judge Florence Cooper said
Friday. ``But on this and another occasion, you gave the impression
your conduct has improved.''
   On April 9, Bridges told the judge he failed to make a previous
appearance because he was involved in a car accident on his way to
the courthouse.
   Bridges, the former child star of television's ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' is to go on trial July 30 on a felony assault charge
stemming from the Feb. 2 shooting of an unarmed man in a Los Angeles
house where drugs were on sale.
   Bridges was acquitted of attempted murder and involuntary

testified he was too high on cocaine to remember what happened.
   Jurors could not reach a verdict on the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon, and prosecutors refiled that charge.

   Bob Marley's widow, Alfarita, has been sued
for $10 million for allegedly reneging on promises to perform in
Hawaii.
   Anthony Spence, owner of Premiere Productions, filed the lawsuit
Friday in U.S. District Court alleging that the late reggae star's
widow agreed to perform three concerts in Hawaii in the summer of
1988 and also promised Premiere future concert dates with her son,
Ziggy.
   According to the lawsuit, Premiere advanced Mrs. Marley $22,500
and sent her 15 airplane tickets worth $15,126. The day she was
scheduled to arrive in Hawaii, she canceled, saying bronchitis
prevented her from making the trip, the lawsuit says.
   Spence says she returned only $10,000 of the advance and five
tickets.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the number listed for
Marley's home in Kingston, Jamaica, said the performer was out of
the country and could not be reached for comment.
   Spence is asking for all of the money to be returned plus $10
million in damages for breach of contract and fraud.

<HEAD>Wyoming Prisoners Do Their Time Breaking Wild Horses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA PRODIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIVERTON, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoners in other states whittle away the
hours stamping out license plates. Inmates in a Wyoming program do
their time in the saddle _ or trying to stay in the saddle _ as they
break wild horses.
   Gary Starbuck, superintendent of the Wyoming Honor Farm, said the
2-year-old horse-breaking program molds inmates into more productive
citizens than do prison cells.
   ``Some say they've got it too easy. It's a country club. They
want to see them do hard time,'' Starbuck said as he kept an eye on
the bronco-busting recently at the sprawling, tree-studded
corrections ranch.
   ``But what you end up with is someone bitter, probably harder on
drugs than when he got there. That's been the problem with
corrections for 200 years. It's punishment-oriented,'' he said.
   The prison horse-breaking program is one of four in the United
States, but the only one that breaks horses enough that they can be
ridden, not just led by a halter. The horses then are offered for
adoption by the public for $125 each.
   The program is so popular among inmates that ``the first thing
they want when they get here is boots and a cowboy hat,'' said honor
farm staff supervisor Billy Eppler.
   In Wyoming, one might presume there would be an abundance of
incarcerated cowboys bucking for a chance to get back to their
life's work breaking horses. Not so. There is a shortage of
qualified ranch hands in Wyoming, and most of the eight inmates now
breaking horses knew nothing about the animals before they were
convicted.
   They learned fast.
   ``He kicked me in the head today,'' inmate Joe Trotter, a Chicago
cabinetmaker convicted of a drug charge, said of Blade, one of the
wild horses the Bureau of Land Management rounds up from Wyoming's
open ranges.
   ``It makes me all the more determined to ride him. It's just a
little bit dangerous. That's all,'' he said.
   ``Ever since I was a little kid, I thought of being like a cowboy
of the Old West. I've got it here,'' said inmate Jim Wiggins, who is
doing time for burglary.
   ``I never picked up a horse's foot before I got here. When I get
out I want to keep working with horses.''
   Each inmate in the program produces four to six rideable horses a
month. The horse taming is one of several agriculture programs at
the central Wyoming corrections farm. The other 100 or so inmates
herd cattle and raise pigs or work in the dairy or butcher shop.
   But the wild horse program is considered the most prestigious
assignment among prisoners. It also is lauded by state corrections
officials as a productive method of instilling a sense of
accomplishment, self-confidence and pride.
   ``If they haven't accomplished anything in their life, if they
break a horse, that's a real accomplishment,'' Eppler said.
   The inmates, some serving time for rape and murder, are
considered a low risk for escape from the minimum-security prison.
   The only obstacle to freedom at the scenic ranch in the Wind
River Basin is a split rail fence and a row of cottonwood trees.
   Trotter believes he's a better man for his newfound skill of
breaking horses. But he can't help but desire freedom.
   ``You get to thinking, sitting up there on my horse _ the
mountains are looking pretty good, I could just take off,'' he said.
   ``But it's not like you can ride off into the sunset and forget
about it. They'll catch up to you. You might as well stay put.''

<HEAD>Government Investigates Seat Collapse in Chrysler Minivans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old boy's death in a Pennsylvania
crash has prompted an investigation into possible rear-seat defects
in some Chrysler minivans, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said the company is cooperating
but does not believe the seats are defective.
   ``We have 2 million-plus minivans out there, and we know of no
specific problems with the rear seats,'' Jakobowski said Friday.
   The investigation will focus on Dodge Caravans and Plymouth
Voyagers manufactured in the 1986-89 model years, agency spokesman
Tim Hurd said. It is classified as a preliminary evaluation, which
consists mostly of paperwork.
   If evidence of a widespread problem is found, the investigation
will be upgraded and government engineers will study the possibly
defective parts. Eventually, a recall could be ordered.
   Chrysler manufactures more than half the minivans sold in the
United States. Introduced in the 1984 model year, they are marketed
as the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country.
   The government has received six complaints about the minivans
involving three accidents, four injuries and one death, Hurd said.
   Noah Z. George of Washington County, Pa., died Feb. 11 after the
1987 Voyager in which he was riding crashed. He was strapped in a
booster seat secured to the rear seat by a seat belt.
   The impact tore open the van's rear lift gate and the back seat
collapsed. Noah was thrown about 35 feet into a stream, where he
died of exposure.
   A coroner's jury ruled the seat was ``flimsy and poorly
constructed and is unsafe for public use,'' Farrell Jackson, coroner
of Washington County, said in a letter to consumer activist Ralph
Nader. Jackson called the minivans a ``potential death trap.''
   Jakobowski said the minivans exceed federal standards for
rear-seat construction.
   But Mike Johnson, spokesman for the Nader-founded Center for Auto
Safety, said the federal standards were inadequate. The minivans
should be recalled and the seats reinforced, he said.

<TEXT>
   Many small ``alternative operator service''
companies are not following federal rules designed to protect the
traveling public from misrepresentations and overcharges, government
regulators say.
   The companies provide telephone operators and long-distance
services for many pay phones in public places as well as phones in
hotels, airports, hospitals, schools and other places.
   ``Significant problems continue in the operator services
market,'' the Federal Communications Commission said, despite its
February 1989 order establishing minimum disclosure requirements for
five of the companies.
   The commission said Friday it would use findings of an audit
April 10 and 11 of 971 phones at 351 public places to prepare an
investigation of the operator services industry.
   Congress also is considering restrictions, including price
controls, on the operator companies, which have flourished since the
AT&amp;T breakup opened competition in the $12 billion market for
assisted phone calls.
   The operator services companies contract with businesses to
handle their ``dial 0'' long-distance service for telephones used by
their customers.
   The operator companies then lease circuits from long-distance
carriers such as AT&amp;T, US Sprint and MCI, and pay a commission to
their partners who own the phones.
   Critics claim this arrangement invites inflated charges.
   Before it acted last year, the commission had received thousands
of complaints from travelers who said they sometimes were
overcharged two or three times what their regular long-distance
company would charge. They also said they weren't informed of who
was handling their calls and that they got bills from places they
never visited.
   In its 1989 order, the FCC required that the operator companies
identify themselves to callers orally and that they place written
notices with their names and addresses on or near the telephones
they served.
   The companies also were prohibited from ``blocking'' callers from
reaching their own long-distance companies and from billing
customers' calls from cities other than the one where the call
originated.
   Operator services officials in February told a Senate
subcommittee that the industry was beginning to police itself and
follow the FCC rules. But in its April 10-11 survey, the FCC said it
found:
   _Operators identified their companies orally 87 percent of the
time, but only 20 out of 971 phones fully complied with the
requirement for written notices. More than 30 percent of the phones
failed to identify the operator services provider, and in more than
200 cases the name on the written material was not that of the
company providing the service.
   _Blocking of access to the customer's long-distance service
occurred 40 percent of the time.
   ``The audit indicates that the phones surveyed vary widely in
their compliance with the federal requirements and confirms the
commission's assessment, based on complaints received ... that
significant problems continue in the operator services market,'' the
commission said.

<HEAD>Judge Says Insurance Companies Must Pay Surcharges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused to stop the collection of
about $50 million in surcharges from auto insurance companies under
the state's new insurance-reform law.
   But state Supreme Court Justice Daniel J. O'Hern left the door
open Friday for an appeal to be reviewed by the full Supreme Court
next week.
   Under the law, the state plans to collect $1.4 billion in
surcharges during the next seven years. The surcharges are intended
to help reduce a $3 billion debt incurred by the Joint Underwriting
Association pool for high-risk drivers.
   Insurance companies say the surcharges are unconstitutional
because they can't charge higher premiums to cover the additional
cost.
   Attorneys for the state say the new law does not prevent
insurance companies from making a reasonable profit. But they say
the insurance companies must help pay for the large high-risk-pool
debt, which Gov. Jim Florio maintains the insurance industry helped
create.
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. initiated the appeal
to block the first surcharge payment, which was due Friday. State
Farm, the state's third largest insurer, was to pay $6.5 million.
   Florio, who advocated the reform law, praised O'Hern's ruling.
   ``The decision reinforces my confidence that the
constitutionality of the law will be upheld,'' the governor said.
``I am pleased that we can move on with the task of bringing real
relief to the state's drivers.''
   David F. Snyder, an attorney for the American Insurance
Association, also saw reason for optimism in the ruling.
   ``We are encouraged by the serious review the state Supreme Court
is giving to our concerns,'' said Snyder. ``We believe the law will
ultimately be determined unconstitutional.''

   Investigators took on an alleged mob-led gambling
operation that relied on computers and displayed a little
sophistication of their own _ they tapped a fax machine.
   ``When they get a copy, we get a copy,'' Queens District Attorney
John Santucci said Thursday after authorities claimed to have broken
up a $50 million gambling ring in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island.
   ``Technology is available to the criminal element,'' he said.
``We have to stay abreast of the new technology.''
   Until recently, criminals were succeeding in hiding many of their
transactions with computers and fax machines. But then investigators
learned how to tap the fax phone line, Santucci said.
   In raids Wednesday and Thursday, city police and prosecutors
arrested 40 men and women at 17 fake storefronts and two apartments,
seized $50,000 in cash and 80 slot machines, computers and phones.
   ``There was a time when the work was carried in brown paper
bags,'' said police Inspector Frank Biehler. ``These vast amounts of
money are beyond manual means. Fax machines eliminate people having
to carry gambling records through the streets.''
   Infiltrating the operation was difficult because ``this is
basically the first time we've found such sophisticated computer
equipment in a numbers operation,'' Biehler said.
   Among those arrested were alleged associates of the Gambino
organized crime family, including Carmelo Amato, 35, of Valley
Stream, N.Y., Santucci said.
   The raids ``made a serious dent in the Gambino crime family,'' he
said.
   But authorities said the raids would do little to curb the
public's appetite for the illegal business.
   ``There's still a part of the public that insists on doing

   A judge sentenced a county sheriff to three years
in prison for extortion and tax evasion.
   Richard B. Lankford, who has been suspended as Fulton County's
sheriff, maintained his innocence as U.S. District Judge Richard C.
Freeman sentenced him Friday.
   Lankford apologized ``for not being better able to prove my
innocence.''
   Lankford must serve 27 months behind bars. He was fined $6,000.
He could have gotten up to 46 years and a $1 million fine.
   Lankford, Georgia's first elected black sheriff, was convicted in
March of two counts of extortion and two counts of tax evasion. He
was acquitted on one count of attempted extortion and the jury
deadlocked on 21 other counts.
   Prosecutors said he demanded payoffs from a jail caterer and
failing to report the money on his tax returns.
   Lankford must surrender to federal authorities July 9 if he isn't
allowed to remain free on bond during appeal.
   An acting sheriff was appointed to replace Lankford after his
indictment. He lost his $56,000 salary upon conviction, but he
retains the title of sheriff until his appeals are exhausted or his
term in office ends.

   About 50 Soviet Jews who have been denied
permission to emigrate rallied in downtown Moscow, demanding that
their plight not be ignored as U.S. and Soviet leaders meet in
Washington.
   ``Refuseniks are the hostages of perestroika!'' read banners and
posters at the protest. ``Shame on anti-Semitism!''
   The half-hour demonstration Friday on a puddle-filled square in
front of the Lenin Library was timed to coincide with one in
Washington. It occurred with little harassment from Soviet
authorities.
   Two vans filled with police were parked nearby. Several
plainclothes police _ who made little attempt to hide their
walkie-talkies _ milled in the crowd. But only one uniformed officer
walked up to the demonstrators and asked them to disperse. He walked
away when protesters showed they had applied fro permission.
   ``Our demonstration is synchronized with a demonstration in
Washington. We insist that our human rights are violated,'' said
Mike Shapiro, who said he has been denied an emigration visa even
though he stopped his secret work for the Soviet government more
than 12 years ago.
   Stephen Cohen of Palm Beach, Fla., a member of the board of
directors of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, said there are
400 to 500 families of Jews who have been refused permission to
emigrate because Soviet officials say they have knowledge of state
secrets.
   In November, the Supreme Soviet legislature gave preliminary
approval to a bill that allows emigration for virtually anyone who
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
   It sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be kept
from emigrating because of access to secrets.
   But Jewish activists claim that the bill is vaguely worded and
might still be used to restrict emigration.
   The bill has not yet come up for a final vote. The United States
is withholding action on loosening trade sanctions on the Soviet
Union until the immigration law is passed.
   Leonid Stonov, one long-time refusenik who was told in recent
weeks that he will be allowed to emigrate in August, said
anti-Semitism is on the rise and that he sees a difficult future for
Jews in the Soviet Union.
   ``All the Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, Jewish life _
everything was ruined here during the Stalin era and Brezhnev era.
There is no basement, no foundation for establishing here a real
Jewish life,'' he said.
   Mark M. Kotlyar, a refusenik from Kiev, was asked how he felt
when he saw President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cheered on the streets of
Washington this week. He said it was a difficult question to answer.
   ``On the one hand, it's important that people be friendly, that
they meet our leaders, that they give them a warm reception,''
Kotlyar said. ``But on the other hand, I think that they are too
rapturous about Gorbachev. He is not that good. He is not.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it won't appeal the
sentence of a suspended Cornell University graduate student placed
on probation for paralyzing a nationwide computer network.
   The Justice Department, which had sought a prison term for Robert
T. Morris Jr., decided last month not to appeal the lighter sentence
imposed by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y., on May 4.
   The decision, announced Friday, was made after a recommendation
by Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the
criminal division, officials said.
   Morris, 23, convicted of unleashing a computer virus in 1988 that
immobilized 6,000 computers linked to a government network, was
placed on three years' probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to
perform 400 hours of community service.
   Morris was the first person convicted under the 1986 Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act. He was found guilty in January of breaking and
entering the Internet Computer Network by designing and unleashing a
computer virus.
   Under procedures that took effect in 1987, both the prosecution
and defense may appeal the judge's sentence. Justice officials felt
prosecutors made their point by obtaining the felony conviction,
said spokesman Doug Tillett.

   Federal health officials say they support a
drug prevention program that focuses on changing the way communities
view legal and illegal drug use, rather than just telling youngsters
to say no.
   ``This program is unique because it utilizes all components in
the community _ schools, parents, the media and community groups _
which contribute to changing the social norms for drug use and
providing a healthy drug-free environment for all people,'' Charles
R. Schuster, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said
Friday.
   Schuster's agency helped pay for an evaluation of the Midwestern
Drug Abuse Prevention Research Project, a just-completed five-year
study in Kansas City and Indianapolis by researchers from the
University of Southern California.
   Researchers began tracking 5,500 teen-agers when they were in the
sixth and seventh grades in 50 Kansas City schools and studied a
similar group at 57 schools in Indiana.
   Among the major findings:
   _36 percent of the students who participated in the program, now
high school juniors and seniors, said they drank alcohol in the last
month, while 50.1 percent of those not in the program admitted the
same behavior.
   _24.1 percent of the participating students smoked cigarettes in
the last month, compared with 32 percent of those who didn't receive
the program's prevention messages.
   _14.2 percent of the program students smoked marijuana in the
past month, compared with 20.2 percent of those in a control group.

<HEAD>North Testifies Before New Grand Jury Investigating Iran-Contra</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver North testified
before a newly empaneled federal grand jury that is continuing the
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal.
   North was accompanied into the grand jury room Friday by a
prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   North repeatedly left the secret proceedings during an entire day
of testimony to confer with his attorneys in a courthouse hallway.
   Walsh's office is trying to determine the precise roles that
then-President Reagan, then-Vice President Bush and others played in
the affair, sources familiar with the investigation said in April.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said North and
former national security adviser John Poindexter were likely to be
subpoenaed and granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
their grand jury testimony.
   North appeared in federal court a week ago in a closed session
for which all records are under seal.
   The grand jury probing the scandal began meeting last month,
after Poindexter's April felony convictions.

   Investigators suspect a black Emory University
freshman faked racist threats she said she received. But prosecutors
said they lacked evidence to press charges.
   DeKalb County Solicitor Ralph Bowden said Friday he felt
premedical student Sabrina Collins needs ``counseling and treatment,
not prosecution.''
   Ms. Collins, 19, was hospitalized after she collapsed and became
mute April 10.
   Her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and found the
words ``die nigger die'' scribbled in nail polish on the floor.
   The incident ignited a campus controversy at a time of growing
reports of racism at colleges around the country.
   Ms. Collins also had reported receiving other threats, including
one in a typewritten letter sent through campus mail.
   But almost as soon as the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began
looking into Collins' allegations, evidence suggested she staged the
episodes herself, a police file released Friday said.
   The typewritten death threat misspelled the word ``you're,'' and
the report said only Ms. Collins could have written it.
   The case file said ``Your' as opposed to `you're' is a
grammatical mistake that Sabrina frequently makes.'' Emory police
gave GBI investigators a sample of Ms. Collins' handwriting that
read, ``Tammy, your the best.''
   ``The typewriter used to type the letter is the same type as
typewriters in the library where Sabrina works. All identifiable
fingerprints on the letter were Sabrina's fingerprints. The
fingerprints pattern on the letter indicates Sabrina put the letter
in the typewriter and removed it,'' the report said.
   Ms. Collins' attorney, James Howard, was not available for
comment Friday. On Thursday he maintained his client did not harass
herself, and that the person responsible for the racial epithets was
free to do so again and had succeeded in avoiding investigation.
   Emory spokeswoman Jan Gleason said university officials do not
intend to press charges against Ms. Collins.

   Candy sales increased suddenly in this
town of 14,000 after schoolchildren shared some of $10,000 a
seventh-grader found buried in a neighbor's barn.
   ``We've got an officer working full-time to get some of the money
back,'' Clearlake Police Lt. Bob Chalk said Friday. ``But some of
the money has already been spent at the Frosty Freeze and the
grocery store. They're buying candy.
   The seventh-grader, a 13-year-old whom police would not identify,
brought the packet of $20, $50 and $100 bills to Oak Hill Middle
School on Thursday. It was part of $40,000 a man had buried in a
metal box for the past 20 years, police said.
   Children probably saw the man bury something in his barn and grew
curious about what they would find, police said.
   Principal Sue Daly said students began turning in cash on Friday.
Police said about $7,000 was still missing.
   ``Some very honest children have been coming up to us and handing
us money all day,'' Daly said. ``And police are going to the homes
of some of the kids who have had big bills on them lately.''
   The man who lost the money blames himself for his misfortune.
   ``It's just something that was stupid, bad judgment,'' he told
the Lake County Record-Bee, which did not identify him.
   ``If a person can get back 70 percent of the money from something
like this, I think they're doing pretty good,'' he added. ``It's
about the same thing I would have done if I were their age.''

   Even some students who had protested
first lady Barbara Bush's selection as Wellesley College's
commencement speaker praised her address, which ended with an ironic
comment on first spousehood.
   Mrs. Bush appeared with Raisa Gorbachev at Friday's ceremony and
later credited the Soviet first lady with the warm reception they
received, calling her ``my secret weapon.''
   Mrs. Bush stressed the importance of family life in her speech to
the graduating women. But she received the loudest cheers when she
closed saying, ``Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone
who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White
House as the President's spouse. I wish him well!''
   One of the 575 seniors had painted on her mortar board ``Barbara
Bush for President 1992.'' Another wore a picture of President and
Mrs. Bush, with the first lady dressed in a suit and power tie, the
president wearing a dress.
   Last month, 150 of Wellesley's 2,200 students signed a petition
complaining that Mrs. Bush's selection as speaker ran counter to the
school's philosophy that women should be honored for their own
career achievements.
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of college to marry George Bush as World
War II raged a continent away, and has been known best as a
supportive wife and mother.
   In her speech, Mrs. Bush, who wore a black academic robe with a
purple cowl, urged the graduates to pursue professional careers if
they wish.
   But she said: ``At the end of your life, you will never regret
not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not
closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a
husband, a child, a friend, or a parent.''
   ``I thought it was lovely _ and I was one who signed the
petition,'' said Betsy Pollard, 21, a graduating senior from Pepper
Pike, Ohio, as she sat with the other graduates after Mrs. Bush and
Mrs. Gorbachev spoke.
   ``I was very moved by it. I thought she was great,'' Pollard said.
   Not all the protesters were appeased, though.
   ``Barbara Bush made choices and I respect those choices, but I
think she was asked to come here because she is the wife of the
president,'' said Patricia Hawkins, 32, of Deer Park, N.Y.
   Speaking second, Mrs. Gorbachev gave a serious, but upbeat, talk
on the virtues of Soviet perestroika and the economic reforms
undertaken by her husband, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Then, sounding some of the themes that Mrs. Bush hit, she spoke
of ``the values that bring us together,'' including love of country
and children.
   ``If people in the world today are more confident of a peaceful
future, we have to give a good deal of credit for that to women,''
said Mrs. Gorbachev, a former university lecturer who has a Ph.D in
philosophy.
   Seniors arriving for the ceremony found letters on their chairs
urging Mrs. Bush to be a stronger proponent of women's issues.
   The authors also distributed armbands of purple _ the class color
_ to be worn by students sympathetic with the letter.
   The letter said that ``in honoring Barbara Bush as our
commencement speaker, we celebrate all the unknown women who have
dedicated their lives to the service of others. The purple armbands
you see today are in honor of these very women.''
   When college President Nan Keohane cited that section in her
remarks, loud applause erupted. Mrs. Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush smiled
broadly and clasped hands.
   Later, the first ladies toured downtown Boston, pausing for a
stop at the Public Garden near Beacon Hill.
   There, Mrs. Gorbachev told reporters, ``I belong to the people
who believe that children and family are very important to women.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev, who has a daughter, acknowleged that many women
now feel otherwise.
   ``It's one of the great controversies of our time,'' she said.

<HEAD>Vaccine Protects Chimps from Human AIDS Virus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biotechnology company that nearly gave up
looking for an AIDS vaccine three years ago now says it has made a
vaccine that protected chimpanzees from the human AIDS virus.
   ``Our scientists just didn't give up,'' Jack Murphy, spokesman
for Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, said Friday.
   ``We have fairly high hopes for this, but it will take years to
develop anything that could protect humans from AIDS,'' Murphy said.
``This, right now, is more of a scientific development and certainly
not a breakthrough.''
   Dr. Daniel F. Hoth, who directs the AIDS division at the National
Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.,
called the Genentech findings ``a potentially very important step.''
   ``It's another brick in the wall we are building to show that an
AIDS vaccine is feasible,'' Hoth said.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must approve the vaccine
for testing on humans before further research can begin, Genentech
officials said.
   The company had virtually abandoned similar research in 1987
after making no headway. Until recently, researchers were only able
to protect chimpanzees from a simian form of the AIDS virus, but not
the human virus itself, Murphy said.
   The Genentech vaccine is among several being developed in hopes
of finding a way protect people from contracting acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, which leaves victims vulnerable to deadly
cancers and ailments.
   More than 80,000 Americans have died from AIDS since it was first
reported in the early 1980s.
   Vaccines don't cure a disease, but prevent those who have been
vaccinated from becoming infected.
   The Genentech vaccine is genetically engineered, as are two other
vaccines the FDA has approved for testing in people to protect them
against the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   One of the vaccines, approved for testing in August 1987, was
developed by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. The second,
developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb Co., of New York, was approved for
human trials in November 1987.
   Dr. Jonas Salk, who developed a vaccine for polio, also is
testing an experimental vaccine made from inactivated AIDS viruses
that are replicated and don't contain anything that could be
infectious.
   ``The hardest part about developing these vaccines is they're
very specific and work against only one type of virus,'' Murphy
said. Eventually, he said, a vaccine must be developed that protects
against all strains of the disease.
   Phillip W. Berman of Genentech and Jorg Eichberg of the Southwest
Biomedical Research Center of San Antonio, Texas, developed the
Genentech vaccine for chimpanzees that were housed in Texas during
the experiment.
   The research is to be published in the June 14 issue of the
British medical journal Nature. Genentech got permission from the
journal to announce the findings early so it could be reported at
the company's upcoming annual shareholders' meeting on June 8.
   In the experiment, two chimpanzees immunized with the
experimental vaccine and then injected with the HIV virus remained
healthy six months afterward. An unvaccinated chimp became infected
within seven weeks, the researchers said.

   Riot police firing tear gas raided a
university campus early today to end violent protests that have
forced the suspension of classes for seven weeks.
   At the request of faculty members, about 1,500 riot police
entered the campus of Sejong University in eastern Seoul and took
away 116 students barricaded atop a five-story school building.
   The students hurled firebombs and rocks as police stormed the
building, but no serious injuries were reported.
   On Friday, hundreds of students armed with steel bars seized the
building after driving out their president, who was protected by a
rival student group. A dozen students were injured in clashes
between the rival groups.
   Sejong students have suspended classes to demand that their
president resign. They also called for reforms, more student
autonomy and an end to corrupt school operations.
   Radical students have staged similar protests on many other
campuses in recent years to expel pro-government or corrupt
foundations that run schools. Education authorities have accused
radicals of using campuses as anti-government strongholds.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of striking British
Columbia truckers snarled traffic at four U.S.-Canada border
crossings to press for higher pay. But new talks were planned to try
to end the week-old dispute.
   The truckers' Western Owners Operators Association, the trucking
industry and the Teamsters Union have agreed to go back to the
bargaining table, the province's solicitor general, Russ Fraser,
said late Friday. He said he would name a mediator today.
   Fraser said he has asked truckers to stop blocking the border
crossings and scale back the strike, which has halted grocery
deliveries in many areas, causing spotty shortages around the
province.
   Pickets and parked trucks blocked crossings in both directions
late Friday at Blaine, Lynden, Sumas and Oroville, Wash. The
independent truckers, who have been on strike since last weekend,
let passenger cars and non-commercial vehicles through.
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported a bomb threat, a broken
windshield and a severed brake line on one truck.
   Rick Sather, a member of the Canadian Western Owner-Operator's
Association committee overseeing the blockade, said some violence
was regrettable but expected and not encouraged by association
leadership.
   ``Desperate people do desperate things,'' Sather said. ``There
must be 2,500 guys out here now, and it's when the trucks start
burning that you have to start getting worried. A few broken
windshields ain't anything.''
   Fraser would not say why police had not moved in to clear the
blockades.
   ``There are things we can do if it's seen that the law is being
broken consistently,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
   Only spotty shortages were reported around the province, but some
said lack of deliveries could make the strike felt in short order.
   ``I would imagine that people are starting to get a little
shaky,'' said Art Tonlinson, director of services for the B.C. and
Yukon Hotels Association. ``Going into tourist season, it could be
disastrous.''
   Canadian truckers are demanding an increase in base pay to $40
Canadian per hour. They currently earn $26 to $35 Canadian per hour,
but they pay for all their own fuel and truck maintenance.
   Truckers say they can't meet their expenses at current rates,
which they said are lower than they were 10 years ago. In U.S.
dollars, the truckers demands are equivalent to $34 per hour, and
their current base wages range from $22 to $29 per hour.
   American truckers had differing views on the blockade.
   Steven Boyd Vinson, of Centralia, Wash., said he didn't realize
the Canadian strike meant blocked traffic.
   ``I figured there'd just be a bunch of guys on the side of the
road yelling,'' he said, adding he didn't think the blockade was
``doing anybody any good.''
   ``I'm all for it,'' said Larry Radcliff, an Oregon-based trucker.
``They've got to get their wages up.''

<HEAD>Anheuser-Busch Alleges Coors Advertising Deceptive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch has accused its competitor Adoph
Coors Co. of false advertising for implying that Coors beer comes
from Rocky Mountain springs, when some of it contains Virginia water.
   In a recent letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the St.
Louis-based Busch said, ``Coors produces liquid beer concentrate in
Golden, Colorado then ships that liquid via railroad tank car more
than a thousand miles east where local water is added to dilute the
concentrate prior to packaging.''
   ``It's a clear matter of consumer deception,'' said Busch
executive vice president Michael Roarty.
   Coors spokeswoman Anita Russell told The Denver Post in a story
today that Busch was merely trying to discredit the company in the
competitive beer marketing game.
   Russell said the ad was accurate and that Rocky Mountain spring
water is the company's ``birthright.''
   She acknowledged about 14 percent of the company's 17.7
million-barrel beer production in Golden last year was shipped as
concentrate to the company's Elkton, Va. plant, where water and
carbonation were added before packaging.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. is the industry leader, with about 42
percent of the U.S. beer market. Coors this year passed Stroh's to
become the third brewer with 9 percent of the market. Miller Brewing
Co. is second with more than 20 percent.
   In its complaint to the FTC, Busch referred to a recent Coors
television advertising campaign in which a voice says, ``Clean,
fresh, pure Rocky Mountain Spring water. Next time you reach for a
beer, remember...'' Then the screen reads: ``Great Beers Start Here.
Coors.''
   Claude Wild, the FTC regional director in Denver, said he had not
seen the Busch letter.

   It wasn't exactly pennies from heaven, but a juror
who spotted a river of floating cash thought he stumbled upon a
godsend.
   Instead, the 20-foot-wide bed of bills was scooped up by federal
agents who proclaimed the fortune a fake.
   U.S. Secret Service agents believe counterfeiters dumped the $5,
$10 and $20 bills into the Miami River. Many of the bills had
similar serial numbers, a detail counterfeiters try to avoid, said
Secret Service spokesman Paul Hackenberry.
   ``It must not have been good if they threw it in the river,''
said Hackenberry.
   But the $20,000 in fake greenbacks looked pretty real to Carlos
Rangel, who noticed the bills Thursday morning as he arrived for
jury duty at the Metro-Dade Justice Building.
   ``The money was floating all over the place,'' he said. ``I've
never seen so much money in my life.''
   Rangel reported his find to a bailiff, who contacted police.

   A helicopter crash has hospitalized pilot
Charles ``Cheater'' Bella, who made headlines two years ago when his
chopper was commandeered for a prison escape.
   Bella, 44, and passenger Robert Pounds Sr., both of El Paso, were
hospitalized in stable condition after their helicopter crashed
while trying to reach the top of a mountain Friday afternoon, state
police spokesman Harold Covey said.
   Both men suffered only minor injuries. But Bella is beginning to
think there's a message in his recent helicopter troubles, his wife,
Carrol, said.
   ``I think there's someone upstairs telling us to get out of the
business,'' she said. ``He told me he thought he'd had it (with
flying). We've had too many bad things happen to us and
helicopters.''
   Bella was the pilot of a helicopter that landed inside the
recreation yard of New Mexico State Penitentiary in Santa Fe on July
11, 1988. Three inmates jumped aboard and escaped.
   The helicopter was fired upon by prison guards and U.S. Customs
agents during the escape and ensuing air chase.
   Bella and two of the inmates were arrested at Albuquerque
International Airport. The third inmate was captured near an airport
south of Los Lunas.
   Bella was acquitted last year of conspiracy and assisting an
escape. He maintained he was forced at gunpoint to take part in the
escape.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms spawned about 10 tornadoes from Minnesota to
Texas, killing two people and injuring 19. Late spring snow fell in
the Rockies.
   One twister late Friday near the west Texas town of Iraan caused
nine car accidents, and two people were killed. Mike Cox of the
state Department of Public Safety said the tornado apparently struck
cars on a highway.
   Fourteen people were injured in the accidents, including two
state troopers cut by flying glass when high winds blew out the
windows of their patrol car. Five more people were injured when a
house collapsed, authorities said.
   The twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the water
supply in nearby McCamey, where officials warned 2,400 residents to
conserve water.
   Also in Texas, a storm raked the Dallas-Fort Worth area with
winds of up to 60 mph and dumped 2 inches of rain in about 20
minutes, the National Weather Service said.
   The latest storms come after spring storms and some of the worst
flooding Texas has seen in 50 years killed 13 people and forced
about 10,000 from their homes. Forty-six counties have been declared
disaster areas.
   An unseasonable cold front pushing past the Rockies on Friday
caused the turbulent weather.
   Other tornadoes were reported late Friday in Wyoming, Nebraska,
South Dakota and Minnesota, the National Weather Service said.
   In northwestern Minnesota, stong winds thought to be a tornado
damaged at least three farms and felled trees near Felton.
   Forecaster Mark Ewens in Fargo, N.D., said the winds in Minnesota
were most likely a gust-front tornado, a rare twister that forms
ahead of storm fronts.
   ``They're small, weak tornadoes that nonetheless cause a lot of
damage,'' Ewens said.
   In South Dakota, twisters were spotted in central and eastern
parts of the state, but no damage was immediately reported. Severe
thunderstorms also crossed the state, bringing up to 3 inches of
rain in some areas.
   Severe thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes and golf-ball size
hail in central Nebraska, the weather service said. Five farm houses
were heavily damaged in Merna, and minor damage was reported
southwest of Sargent.
   A funnel cloud was spotted near Cheyenne, Wyo., but dissipated
quickly and no damage was reported. But thunderstorms dumped as much
as 4 inches of rain.
   Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains and was expected in northern
Colorado mountains.
   ``It is unusual for this time of year. It's not inconceivable,
but it is unusual,'' forecaster Jim Hatten said.

<HEAD>Judges Send Asbestos Victims Fund Back to Bankruptcy Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two judges have ordered the overhaul of a
financially ailing trust fund designed to compensate more than
130,000 victims of asbestos-related illnesses.
   A federal judge and a New York state judge said Friday the fund,
set up by the Manville Corp., was out of money and suggested the
company advance it $200 million to $300 million so it can resume
payments to victims.
   In a joint order, the judges ordered Manville's bankruptcy case
reopened to overhaul the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.
   The judges ordered the trust to make changes in 10 days and said
that if the bankruptcy court did not resolve the payment plan they
would impose their ruling at a hearing on July 9.
   The trust was formed from the company's 1988 reorganization, six
years after it was driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over
production of asbestos, the insulation and building material found
to cause severe and sometimes fatal illnesses.
   The trust came under fire last month because of a cash shortage
induced by more claims, larger payouts and quicker settlements than
expected. The trust told the judges that claimants filing this year
wouldn't get paid until 2004.
   ``Many more than 100,000 claimants all over the country and the
limited assets cry out for a more workable and compassionate
system,'' U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York State
Supreme Court Judge Helen E. Freedman said in a joint order.
   The judges are supervising nearly 500 asbestos lawsuits against
the trust and other defendants stemming from work at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard dating to the 1940s.
   Last month, the judges sharply criticized trust management and
said the bankruptcy court could lift an injunction barring asbestos
victims from suing Manville directly. Currently, only the trust can
be sued.
   On Friday, they supported keeping the injunction in place if
changes in the trust are made.
   As part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, Manville
placed $2.5 billion in assets, mostly stock, into the trust. The
company also agreed to contribute $75 million annually beginning in
1991 plus 20 percent of annual net income from 1992 until all claims
are paid.
   Trust managers told the judges this week it had paid out almost
all of its $800 million in cash. They said the fund has not been
mismanaged, denying claims that hundreds of millions of dollars were
paid to a few plaintiffs' lawyers.
   The judges said more than 130,000 remaining claims require an
estimated $6.5 billion, and with incoming claims and costs, the
trust needs at least $7.5 billion. But the trust now is worth only
about $1.5 billion, they said.
   The trust has paid an average of about $42,000 on each of the
first 22,000 claims plus 8 percent administrative costs, the judges
said.
   Denver-based Manville issued a statement that it was pleased the
judges supported continuing the injunction against lawsuits against
the company.
   The company, which makes fiberglass and forest, construction and
other products, said it is ``willing to discuss issues related to
cash flow and liquidity of the trust.'' It declined further comment
on the court order.
   A spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based trust said all
officials were out of town or in meetings and could not comment on
the ruling.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $28.7 Million in AIDS Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $28.7 million in the case of a
5-year-old boy who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. The
boy's lawyer said he believed it was the largest award ever in an
AIDS-related case.
   The jury Friday awarded $26.7 million to the boy, Alex Edwards,
and $1 million each to his parents, Roy and Pat Edwards.
   The jury on May 23 found Dr. Abraham Kuruvilla and his clinic,
Neonatology Associates Ltd., liable for ordering the transfusion to
correct severe respiratory problems caused by fluid in the lungs.
   The Edwards' lawyer, R. Douglas Dalton, had argued that Kuruvilla
should have received consent from the boy's parents for the
transfusion. The boy's father testified that the couple expressed
concerns about AIDS and offered to donate their own blood when the
boy was given a previous transfusion.
   But Kuruvilla's lawyer, Duane Olson, said Mrs. Edwards signed a
consent form letting doctors treat her son as they saw fit.
   Dalton said the largest previous verdict he knew of in an
AIDS-related case was $12 million awarded March 8 in Columbus, Ohio,
to an 8-year-old girl who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion.
   Olson said he would seek to overturn the award. Two other
defendants, a blood bank and the hospital where the transfusion was
performed, settled out of court.

<TEXT>
   Recent flooding along the Red River unearthed
a remarkably well-preserved canoe buried for 250 years beneath tons
of silt.
   The nearly 25-foot long dugout is carved out of a single log of
what appears to be a cottonwood tree. It has a square hull, and only
a part of the bow and a section of bottom are missing.
   ``This is a phenomenal find,'' said Bonnie McKee, a board member
of The Archaeological Conservancy in Dallas.
   Dale Moore, a farmer in this community about 100 miles northeast
of Dallas, made the discovery during a Memorial Day picnic with his
family. Moore and his daughter were fishing when they found the
canoe upside down on a dried-out section of the river bank, he said.
   ``I stopped and said, `Have you ever seen a square tree?''' he
said.
   Moore, who enlisted the help of four friends to move the canoe,
is keeping it soaked down under burlap. Eventually it will undergo a
process by which moisture is slowly removed and replaced by a
strengthening solvent.
   J.C. Blaine, a museum consultan and specialist in early American
artifacts, said: ``We very rarely get a wooden artifact in this kind
of shape. Not only that, but this is the largest one of its kind.''
   The canoe, which weighs about 600 pounds, is covered with hack
marks.
   ``They appear to be metal tool marks rather than stone, which
would mean that it was made either by Frenchmen or by Indians who
had trade with the French,'' Blaine said.
   He said the canoe likely comes from between 1730 and 1740 when
such tools were available.
   ``The Indians had lots of wooden tools, but we never get to see
them unless something gets washed out of the river,'' Blaine said.
Glass and metal stay, but wood disintegrates unless it is in water.''
   Blaine said the deteriorated cells of the wood were being held
together by the water in them, which also prevented bacteria from
attacking.
   ``This never should have come out of the water,'' said Blaine.
``Then again, if it hadn't we wouldn't be able to see it.''

<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor met with the man overseeing
bankrupt Eastern Airlines to head off a possible indictment of the
airline for allegedly falsifying maintenance records, a source said.
   The bankruptcy trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, met Friday afternoon
with U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney, according to a highly placed
law enforcement source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Maloney did not return several calls and declined to comment on
the investigation earlier in the week.
   But the source said Shugrue ``was just trying to convince him not
to indict the airline.''
   Shugrue reportedly fears any indictments against Eastern would
scare away passengers and possibly torpedo his efforts to save the
airline.
   ``This is a meeting we've been trying to arrange for quite some
time and it's to present the facts in the case, said Robin Matell,
an Eastern spokesman in Miami. ``I don't know the nature of the
talks.''
   The Daily News reported Friday that the 10-month-old federal
grand jury investigation _ concerned with the airline's safety and
maintenance procedures at Kennedy and LaGuardia airports _ is nearly
complete and that several indictments are expected.
   The panel is looking into allegations that Eastern altered
maintenance and safety records at the airports as well as
questionable practices at the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, the
airline's largest hub.
   One former Eastern official at another airport said mechanics
were routinely certifying that they had tested for water in fuel
tanks when they had not done so. Large amounts of water in a fuel
tank could cause an engine to stall.
   According to the News, federal investigators were looking into
whether top Eastern officials were aware that Eastern managers at
Kennedy and La Guardia allegedly ordered mechanics to disregard
safety guidelines and then falsified logbooks to show that proper
checks were made.
   Shugrue was appointed trustee to run Eastern as Frank Lorenzo's
replacement as the airline tries to pull itself out bankruptcy
proceedings. The Machinists union at Eastern has been on strike
since March 1989.

   City council members on Friday formally adopted the name
Chemnitz, as the city was known before the former Communist
government changed it in 1953 to honor the founder of modern
socialism.
   However, the council decided that the city of 309,000 will be
known by both names for a one-year transitional period.

<HEAD>Doctor's Death Blamed on Overdose of Potent Pain-Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 29-year-old doctor died from a
self-inflicted overdose of a potent pain-killer that has claimed the
lives of 18 other U.S. doctors in the past three years, hospital
officials said.
   The doctor, David Leyda, died at Hartford Hospital on April 25
after taking fentanyl, a synthetic narcotic 200 times more potent
than morphine, said Dr. James J. Richter, head of the hospital's
department of anesthesiology.
   ``It's extremely potent, it produces a quick high, and it is
addictive,'' said Dr. James O'Brien, director of the drug and
alcohol treatment center at the University of Connecticut Health
Center.
   ``Unfortunately, we have a percentage of doctors who abuse it,''
O'Brien said Friday. ``In the last two or three years it's become a
drug of choice among doctors.''
   Forms of the drug, including one sold as China White, also have
shown up on the streets in recent years.
   Leyda, of Ottumwa, Iowa, was in the third year of a four-year
residency program in anesthesiology at Hartford Hospital. He was
found in a private waiting room at the hospital with a syringe
nearby.
   There was no indication that he committed suicide, and hospital
officials and the state medical examiner's office said they consider
the death an accidental overdose.
   Richter said the department did not know before his death that
Leyda had a drug problem, but concluded that he did after a
subsequent investigation in which Leyda's apartment was searched and
drug paraphernalia was found.
   Richter said Leyda was the 19th anesthesiologist in the U.S. to
die from a fentanyl overdose in the past three years.
   Because of their easy access to potent drugs, anesthesiologists
are considered more likely to abuse drugs than are other doctors,
Richter said.
   Fentanyl is so potent it can be taken in tiny doses that are
undetectable in urine tests. The potency means the risk of overdose
is great.
   ``It has a very narrow safety margin,'' Ricther said. ``The
danger zone is unpredictable.''
   Richter said the department lectures residents once a year on the
dangers of drug abuse and has in place a strict system in which
doctors must account for all of the drugs they are given from the
hospital pharmacy.
   ``The problem is that you're dealing with extremely bright people
and they can conceal their behavior to a great extent,'' Richter
said.

   A 2{-ton experimental NASA probe crashed
and sustained about $2 million damage when a wind gust foiled its
landing.
   Dozens of batteries and electronic devices were strewn on the
ground at the landing site, according to Jack Tueller, a scientist
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who helped
build the probe.
   The probe, used to measure radioactivity in the upper atmosphere,
had made two successful experimental flights over Australia in 1988,
officials said. A wind gust apparently caught it as it touched down
Friday in eastern Arizona.
   ``It was supposed to land very softly,'' said Tueller. ``In the
two landings in Australia, there was very little damage.''
   The probe can measure faint emissions from stars, and ``was
putting us on the cutting edge of astronomy,'' Tueller said.
   ``That's why it's so sad to see it smashed up.''
   The gamma-ray imaging spectrometer is one of two in the world,
Tueller said. The other belongs to the University of California in
San Diego.
   NASA engineer Al Huters said the probe cost $2 million to $3
million to build. He said the device rides on a steel gondola about
10 feet square and is carried aloft by a helium-filled balloon.
   It was launched Thursday morning from an airport at Fort Sumner,
N.M., and reached an altitude of more than five miles.
   NASA workers loaded the wreckage onto a flatbed trailer-truck and
said the probe would be taken to the Goddard Space Center in
Maryland for repairs.

   What an angry father put asunder more than three
decades ago a modern matchmaking service has restored.
   Judy Musso and William Vogue plan to be married years after they
stopped seeing each other because her father disapproved.
   ``It's almost a storybook thing,'' said the Rev. Douglas Stearns
of the DeSoto Presbyterian Church who will preside over ceremonies
on Sept. 1.
   Ms. Musso said her mother is happy she has found Vogue again, and
so are her two sons and his two daughters. Her father died in 1979.
   The couple fondly recalls when they first met 32 years ago at a
charity ball in San Diego.
   ``I was 31 and she was 19,'' said Vogue. ``I'll never forget it.
It was May 17, 1958. She had on a light blue formal gown overlaid
with lace. And she had a tiara on her head.''
   But after nine months of secret meetings, Vogue left the state
and lost contact with her.
   They both married three times and raised families.
   Their paths crossed in March when they became members of a Dallas
area dating service.
   Ms. Musso, 51, picked Vogue's voice recording, but had no idea
she had met him before, even after talking an hour on the phone with
him.
   ``We knew each other by different names,'' Ms. Musso said.
   Vogue, 63, had changed from Ray Wilhelm Voge to William Ray
Vogue, and he knew Ms. Musso by her maiden name, Hotchkiss.
   But when Vogue picked her up for dinner, she instantly recognized
him.
   ``My heart almost stopped,'' Vogue said. ``We didn't stop holding
each other for 15 minutes.''
   Vogue asked to marry her after five hours, and five days later
she had moved into his home.
   ``This time it's for good,'' Vogue said.

   Hundreds of Filipino troops backed by
armored vehicles staged a show of force today against Commmunist
rebels after U.S. officials ordered American troops to stay on their
base for security reasons.
   About 500 troops and police motored through the streets
brandishing M-16 rifles and carrying banners denouncing the rebel
New People's Army.
   The motorcade passed in front of the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and
through nearby neighborhoods of Angeles, about 50 miles north of the
capital Manila, where many rebels live and operate.
   Police Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia announced the formation of
neighborhood vigilante groups to help fight the rebels. ``We just
want to convince the people that we are willing to fight and that we
have the manpower and the firepower to fight the enemy,'' Yarcia
told reporters.
   On Friday, U.S. officials announced renewed restrictions on the
20,300 troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents
at Clark, one of six U.S. bases in the Philippines. Officials cited
an undisclosed security threat in the area, where Communist rebels
killed two U.S. airmen last month.
   ``Local, current conditions dictate we take action right now,''
said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Ron Rand. He did not elaborate in his
announcement broadcast by the U.S. military's television station.
   Today, Rand said security patrols around the sprawling base have
been doubled to protect American lives.
   Philippine intelligence sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said rebel troop movements Friday prompted the U.S.
decision.
   Yarcia said that in addition to the civilian vigilantes, two
companies of troops from the elite Philippine Constabulary Regional
Special Action Force would be sent to Angeles to augment the three
battalions stationed in the city.
   One week ago, U.S. officials relaxed restrictions imposed after
rebels killed Airmen John Raven and James Green on May 13, one day
before U.S. and Philippine officials began talks on the future of
the six U.S. bases.
   Troops had since been allowed off-post between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.,
but Rand said the ``limited liberty'' arrangement is indefinitely
suspended.
   Communist guerrillas have fought for 21 years to establish a
Marxist state and have pledged to continue attacking Americans until
all U.S. troops leave the Philippines. Eight Americans have died in
politically motivated violence in the Philippines since April 1989.

   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, hospitalized for the removal a benign cyst,
said today he felt fine, and prepared for a six-week tour of Europe,
the United States and Africa.
   Mandela, looking tired after seven days at Johannesburg's Park
Lane Clinic, held a brief news conference with his surgeon to
discuss the removal of a non-malignant cyst related to his bladder.
   
   Dr. Gus Gecelter said, ``There is no question that the cyst is
anything but inflammatory.''
   He said Mandela, 71, had experienced no adverse effects from the
operation.
   ``He had no problems before or after the operation,'' said
Gecelter, who has attended Mandela for several years.
   Routine medical checks to Mandela's heart, lungs and abdomen were
``perfectly normal,'' he said.
   ``He is a very fit young man for his age,'' Gecelter said.
   Mandela said he felt ``on top of the world.''
   Mandela was expected to leave the clinic this weekend.
   He begins his tour of African, European and American nations on
Monday. The trip includes stops in the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Botswana, Ethiopia, Uganda,
Kenya and Mozambique.
   Mandela said he would use the trip to thank the international
community for helping secure his release in February after 27 years
in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. His
release came under political reforms implemented by President F.W.
de Klerk.
   He also said the pressure applied by foreign nations contributed
to the release of other political prisoners and helped bring about
the first talks between the ANC and the white-led government.
   ``I will also ask the international community to maintain
sanctions, because whatever de Klerk has said, it is up to now
merely rhetoric, nothing further has been done _ all the pillars of
apartheid are still in place,'' he said.

   Heavily armed Palestinian guerrillas who were
intercepted off the Israeli coast this week intended to attack the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, a senior Israeli official said.
   Maps seized from the 16 guerrillas on Wednesday indicated they
were headed for Tel Aviv's densely populated beachfront hotel
district, where the embassy is located, the official said Friday on
condition of anonymity.
   ``During the debriefing we conducted ... it was established that
the U.S. Embassy was one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel
district,'' he said. An army spokesman said he was not authorized to
comment on the report.
   An Israeli military analyst said today that the guerrillas
planned to fire Soviet-made Katyusha rockets at the embassy.
   ``We know that at least one speedboat, or maybe two, had orders,
after onloading their men in the Tel Aviv Marina, to go back to sea
and launch from the sea the rockets on the American Embassy,'' said
Ben-Ishai, military correspondent for the daily Yediot Ahronot,
speaking on Israel radio.
   But Ben-Ishai said the rockets probably could not have hit their
target, located in the hotel district near the marina.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Don Cofman today refused comment on the
reports and would not say whether the embassy had stepped up
security.
   In condemning the aborted raid Wednesday, the State Department
left open the possibility the incident could affect the U.S.
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. That dialogue
began after PLO leader Yasser Arafat denounced terrorism in 1988.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction believed to have
its main headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, has claimed responsibility
for the abortive raid but said it was not aimed at civilians.
   Arafat has denied Israeli charges that the PLO itself was
involved in the raid, but he has not condemned it.
   In a statement Friday in Baghdad, the Front said its guerrillas
had instructions to hit military sites only in a 50-mile-wide area
around Tel Aviv.
   The Front is headed by Mohammad Abbas, known by his nom de guerre
Abul Abbas. A member of the PLO's executive committee, he
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille
Lauro in which an elderly American was shot and killed.
   Israel claims Libya helped mount Wednesday's strike, which was
aimed at crowded Israeli beaches. Israel's military intelligence
chief, in an interview with the Yediot Ahronot daily, provided the
most detailed account yet of that alleged involvement.
   Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak said the guerrillas trained in a camp set
aside for them by Libyan authorities on the Mediterranean coast.
   ``The investigation shows beyond doubt that Libyan military
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation,'' Shahak said
in the newspaper interview.
   But a Libyan official denied Libyan involvement in the raid.
   Gadallah Azouz el-Talhi, Libya's foreign minister, said: ``Some
news media claimed that a Libyan ship carried the speedboats that
tried to go to shore. Libya has no connection at all with the
operation,'' el-Talhi said during a visit to Egypt.
   The Libyan ambassador to Lebanon warned today that the United
States ``would definitely be held responsible'' for any Israeli
retaliatory attack on Libya.
   In an interview on Lebanon's Communist-run Voice of the People
radio, Libyan Ambassador Ashour Fortas claimed Israel was consulting
``with the United States for an aggression against Libya.''
   Israeli forces in helicopter gunships and patrol boats foiled
Wednesday's attempted raid as 16 guerrillas headed for the coast in
speedboats. Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured. No Israelis
were injured.
   On the day of the incident, beaches and beachfront hotels were
crowded with Israelis celebrating the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

   An Indian journalist was taken from his
home today by men wearing Indian army uniforms, witnesses said. The
government denied the military was holding him and called it a
kidnapping.
   Yusuf Jameel, who was covering the separatist movement in Kashmir
for Western news organizations, was taken away from his Srinagar
home in Pratap Bagh district, said Jameel's servant, Hakim Din.
   Din said he woke up Jameel after answering the doorbell rung by
two men wearing army uniforms, demanding to meet the reporter.
   Jameel's photographer, Mehraj Uddin, who also lives in the house,
said Jameel, while getting dressed, told him: ``I am being arrested
by the army. Take care of yourself.''
   A state government spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said the security forces are ``nowhere involved in
this alleged disappearance'' and called the action an attempt at
``maligning the administration and the security forces.''
   Police registered the case as a kidnapping and began
investigating ``to trace out Mr. Jameel and culprits,'' the
spokesman said.
   Din and Uddin said Jameel was driven away in a jeep that looked
similar to those used by the army. Another vehicle that resembled an
army pickup followed the jeep and both vehicles were full of men
wearing soldier's uniforms, they said.
   Other witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the men
were armed but did not use violence.
   Jameel was covering the bloody Moslem separatist movement for
Reuters, the British news agency, and the British Broadcasting Corp.
He has been working for Reuters for at least two years and for the
BBC for about five. He also reports for the The Telegraph, a major
Indian daily published in Calcutta.
   India, which launched a crackdown on Kashmiri separatists in
January, has discouraged foreign reporters from traveling to the
area.
   At least 486 people have been killed since the crackdown began.
Most were militants or supporters of the campaign for the separation
of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, from
predominantly Hindu India.
   Kashmir was divided along a still-disputed frontier between India
and Pakistan after British colonial India became independent in 1947
and was partitioned along religious lines. India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over the territory, in 1947 and 1965.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in Indian-governed
Jammu-Kashmir are Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems account for 12
percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   The Irish Republican Army today claimed
responsibility for murdering a British soldier outside his home in
West Germany and another soldier on a railway platform in England.
   ``Active Service Units of the Irish Republican Army carried out
two separate operations against British military personnel in
England and West Germany last night,'' the IRA said in a statement
issued in Dublin, Ireland.
   ``While British troops remain in Ireland such attacks will
continue,'' said the statement distributed to news media. IRA claims
of responsibility for attacks in Britain and Europe normally are
made in the Irish capital.
   Police in Dortmund, West Germany, said two suspects eluded a
chase early today after gunmen killed a British army major. One
police officer was shot in the foot during the chase.
   In the central England city of Lichfield, police were looking for
two men who shot three soldiers in a daylight attack at a railway
station. A 19-year-old soldier was killed, and the gunmen fled
across the tracks, police said. The other two soldiers survived the
attack.
   Earlier today, Defense Secretary Tom King indicated he believed
the IRA was responsible for both killings.
   ``There is no argument or reason in this. It is simply that they
are out to kill,'' King told Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency.
   ``They are out to cover the humiliation of their mistake in
killing two young Australians in Holland ...''
   The attack in Germany came six days after an IRA unit shot and
killed two Australian tourists in Roermond in The Netherlands. The
IRA said the victims had been mistaken for British soldiers.
   The Defense Ministry said Maj. Michael John Dillon-Lee of the
Royal Artillery was shot today as he drove with his wife from the
military base in Dortmund, West Germany to their home.
   Dillon-Lee was shot several times in the head after he stopped
his car in front of his house, the ministry said. He died
immediately, but his wife was not injured. German police said one of
their officers was shot and wounded as police cars chased the
gunmen, who escaped.
   In Britain, meanwhile, police said they were looking for two men
who fled the scene of the shooting at Lichfield City train station,
100 miles northwest of London. Police initially were reported to
have worn masks, but Lichfield police said today it appeared neither
man was masked.
   Scotland Yard said an anti-terrorist squad was assisting with the
investigation.
   Chief Inspector Tony Johnson of the Staffordshire Police said the
shooting ``bears the hallmarks of an IRA attack.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Authorities said the three soldiers were shot while waiting on a
platform for a train Friday. Witnesses said the gunfire sent
commuters fleeing.
   The three soldiers, who were in training at the Lichfield army
base, were waiting for a train to nearby Birmingham for weekend
leave, said Detective Chief Superintendent Malcolm Bevington.
   He said two men appeared on the platform, pulled out handguns and
shot the soldiers, then jumped onto the tracks, ran across the line
and through a builder's yard opposite the station.
   The Ministry of Defense identified the slain soldier as
19-year-old Pvt. William Robert Davies of Pontarddulais, south
Wales. It identified the wounded soldiers as Robert Parkin, 20, and
Neil Evans, 19.
   A British Rail employee who witnessed the shooting said he jumped
across the tracks to try to help the soldiers.
   ``I and a station employee tried to staunch the flow of blood
from the chest of one of the soldiers,'' he said.
   Although the soldiers were dressed in civilian clothes, their
hairstyles and manner of conduct indicated they were in the
military, he said.
   On Sunday, the IRA killed two Australian lawyers traveling in
Roermond after mistaking them for British soldiers. The IRA later
expressed deep regret over the error. The Australians, who lived in
London, were traveling in a British-registered car, one with his
wife, the other with his girlfriend.
   The IRA wants to unite the predominantly Protestant Northern
Ireland with the Catholic Republic of Ireland in a single socialist
state.

<HEAD>Louisville Seeks to Recruit Black Faculty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Louisville President Donald Swain
has established a system of cash payments and other incentives aimed
at increasing the number of black faculty members at the school.
   ``My intention is to move us ahead quickly in the next five
years,'' Swain said in an interview. He said, for example, that he
will offer $10,000 to academic departments that not only hire black
faculty members but keep them at the Kentucky campus for a sustained
period.
   Similar programs are under way at other American schools. The
Louisville initiative represents ``a variation on a theme that
others are using,'' says Reginald Wilson of the American Council of
Education.
   The University of Michigan began in 1987 to target a percentage
of its budget to hiring minority faculty. Wilson said that since
then, Michigan has hired 77 minority faculty members, including 40
blacks.
   Miami University in Ohio also has ``significantly increased'' its
black faculty, Wilson said. He said the school launched the project
by funding five positions out of his budget.
   Wilson said that Eastern Illinois University gives recognition
and monetary awards each year to the departments that have been
successful in increasing minority staff.
   At the University of California at Santa Barbara, the number of
minority faculty members increased from 7 percent to 14 percent over
the last 15 years. But Chancellor Barbara Uehling said bidding wars,
in which recruiters offer high salaries, promotions and sometimes
tenure, make it difficult to keep them.
   ``These programs are required to get these institutions motivated
to do something,'' said Wilson, who noted that in the 1960s colleges
and universities were motived by ``moral suasion.''
   ``The major appeal is economics now,'' he said.
   Swain acknowledged that his ``action-oriented presidential
initiative,'' which also includes providing financial support to
help candidates complete doctoral degrees, was prompted by racial
tensions on campus.
   Also, Swain said ``Kentucky remains under a federal mandate to
end the last vestiges of segregation in higher education _ this
means specifically adding African-American faculty.''
   ``Over and above legal requirements, we must attract more
African-American faculty to serve the needs of the diverse racial
and ethnic groups _ the largest of which is African-American _ who
look to U. of L. for educational opportunity,'' he said.
   The university had an enrollment of 23,180 in the fall of 1989,
including 2,666 members of minority groups. Black students totaled
1,985, about 8.6 percent. Of the 1,650 faculty members, 172 were
minorities, including 36 blacks, said Denise Fitzpatrick, director
of public information.
   Swain said that faculty affirmative action, while making some
progress in the last nine years, has not ``made sufficient progress,
especially in attracting and retaining African-American faculty.''
   ``I would like the University of Louisville to be a leader in
affirmative action,'' he added.
   For most colleges and universities, recruiting and retaining
minority faculty members has become increasingly important. The
American Council on Education said minority representation on
faculties nationwide remains below 11 percent.
   Between 1977 and 1985, the number of black faculty members barely
increased and the black share of all faculty positions dropped from
4.4 percent to 4.2 percent.
   In 1988, only four blacks in the entire United States received
doctorates in mathematics.
   Swain said the goal of his initiative is to ``remove all
obstacles so that people won't have any excuses about the
procedure.''
   Among other things, an ``African-American Faculty Incentive
Fund'' will be established to encourage academic departments to hire
and retain black faculty.
   In disciplines with few blacks, a black candidate can be offered
a junior faculty position if the qualifications are similar to white
candidates.
   The initiative also includes providing financial support and a
faculty positions for black doctoral candidates who have completed
all the requirements except the dissertation.
   A ``grow our own African-American faculty'' program also will
begin this year to identify promising undergraduates and encourage
them to seek doctoral degrees at the university. The best qualified
will be offered fellowships and other financial benefits.

<TEXT>
   For a studio audience more accustomed to talk
of S&amp;M than S&amp;Ls, it was complicated stuff.
   ``Tomorrow, male strippers _ it will be a lot easier,'' talk show
titan Phil Donahue told the audience as they struggled with the
complexities of the escalating savings and loan crisis. (He was only
teasing: the following show will be on the Ku Klux Klan.)
   Donahue took on the daunting task of bringing the S&amp;L crisis to
Main Street in a program taped Friday in the nation's capital.
   ``All we've got right now is the worst financial scandal in the
history of our beloved democratic experiment,'' he said. ``You and I
are in this.''
   By the time the hour-long show was over, Donahue had whipped the
audience into a frenzy over the thousands of dollars each of them,
as taxpayers, will pay to cover losses to depositors in hundreds of
failed thrifts.
   ``How much of the $400 billion S&amp;L bailout will you pay for?''
was the question posed by the show, to be broadcast in most cities
on Tuesday. The answer: more than $3,000 for each U.S. taxpayer over
the next three decades, including interest.
   Deregulation of the thrift industry ``was the best thing that
happened to the Mob since Prohibition,'' said Stephen Pizzo, one of
Donahue's guests and a co-author of ``Inside Job: The Looting of
America's Savings and Loans''.
   Pizzo said organized crime took advantage of liberalized
regulations for thrifts by taking out big real estate loans that
went bad.
   ``The money didn't go to widows and orphans,'' said Houston Post
reporter Pete Brewton, another guest. ``It went to the political,
criminal and business establishment of this country.'' (Loud
applause.)
   The 200 or so ``ordinary'' people in the studio at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce building were getting worked up. They almost
seemed ready to march on the White House, a stone's throw away
across Lafayette Park.
   ``Take the money, put it under your pillow, and know where it is
in the morning,'' a young man in the audience advised. A woman asked
angrily why the press hasn't been covering the S&amp;L issue more
vigorously.
   Outside, the streets were choked with TV trucks and reporters
covering the summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Just down the street, about 70 protesters picketed the Resolution
Trust Corp., the agency established last year to manage the bailout,
for not offering more subsidized housing to the poor from projects
seized from failed S&amp;Ls.
   Donahue's audience hissed and booed when William Greider, the
other guest, suggested that government officials believe the
American public is ``too stupid'' to understand the S&amp;L debacle.
   ``The political assumption in this town is that you all will not
get aroused enough,'' said Greider, the national editor of Rolling
Stone magazine.
   Donahue threw more fuel on the fire by showing a videotape of
Neil Bush, one of the president's sons, being questioned by Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., at a recent hearing of the House
Banking Committee.
   Regulators have alleged that Bush's role as a former director of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift
that went bust for $1 billion, involved a conflict of interest with
his other business interests.
   ``These are exactly the kinds of incestuous relationships that
led to this kind of looting,'' said Pizzo.
   After the show, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions said industry's remaining health thrifts are helping
pay for the cleanup, in the form of higher deposit insurance
premiums and other charges.
   ``We deplore the criminal elements that invaded the savings
institutions business,'' League spokesman Jim Eberle said in a
telephone interview. ``We are feeling the effects of the criminal
elements and the high-fliers, too.''

<TEXT>
   Only 40 miles from Navy's modern Atlantic
Fleet, rows of rusting hulks that had their fill of salt, sun and
war await the call to carry military cargo in a national emergency.
   Taxpayers get the bill for the 331-ship National Defense Reserve
Fleet, with its dilapidated-looking World War II and post-war cargo
ships, some with grass growing through wooden deck planks.
   Nobody can predict with certainty how many of the drab, mostly
gray ships _ lined up here on the James River and two other main
locations _ will be able to sail.
   But military experts still consider this fleet a strategic asset
to move the Army's heavy equipment, even while they're busy writing
plans to scrap much newer equipment as the communist threat
diminishes.
   The government-built ``Victory'' ships of World War II and their
companions in the fleet no longer have to worry about German
U-boats, but they're taking salvos from members of the House Small
Business subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and
energy.
   Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and ranking Republican William S.
Broomfield of Michigan have scheduled a hearing on the issue Monday,
saying they want to determine whether the fleet is a waste of money.
They said the ships could be turned into moneymakers if Congress
directs the ships be sold to U.S. salvage firms.
   ``The peace dividend is going down the drain with the rust of
these federal assets,'' Wyden said prior to the hearing. Broomfield
commented, ``I would hate to have the defense of our country depend
on these ships, because in the time it would take to renovate them,
the war would be over.''
   A Pentagon official and an official of the Transportation
Department's Maritime Administration (MARAD), which maintains the
fleet, disagreed.
   ``This is not going to be pretty'' said Michael Delpercio, MARAD
director of ship operations. ``Everybody looks at the ships
externally and says, `What a bunch of crap.' But internally, they're
in good shape.''
   Jonathan D. Kaskin, director of the Navy's Strategic Sealift
Division, added, ``This is the only way that we have'' to move heavy
Army equipment that can't go in modern cargo container ships. He
cited a decline in available commercial U.S. cargo vessels and said
it would be prohibitive to build enough military airlift capacity to
hold the same amount of tanks, trucks, ammunition and other
equipment.
   Only 96 vessels in the 331-ship fleet are classified as the Ready
Reserve, ships that are supposed to be able to carry the Army's
equipment on five to 20 days' notice.
   Forty-two other ships in the fleet are so old that they will be
used as target practice for Navy gunners, sunk to become reefs or
traded to salvage companies for newer ships.
   The Maritime Administration says it is spending $6.7 million in
fiscal 1990 to maintain the older part of the fleet and another $89
million for the Ready Reserve portion. The agency is requesting $225
million for the Ready Reserve in fiscal 1991, part of a plan to
increase that component from 96 to 142 ships.
   Wyden said consideration of this request will give Congress ``a
chance to ask some hard questions'' about the fleet, and Broomfield
already has written Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that ``the cost
and time required to restore these ships far outweighs their
usefulness.''
   Some ships in the fleet previously have been sold to salvage
firms for as much as $1.5 million, Delpercio said. The buyers were
foreign companies that were able, with cheaper labor, to underprice
U.S. firms in the bidding.
   Both Wyden and Broomfield said they favor legislation to mandate
sales only to U.S. firms, similar to a law governing disposal of
Navy warships.
   Between the 42 inactive ships and the 96-ship Ready Reserve sits
a fleet consisting of ``Victory'' ships, the name given to a class
of cargo-haulers built near the end of the World War II; former
commercial vessels no longer fit for service; once-active Navy
ships; and various specialty vessels including the Glomar Explorer,
which was built for the CIA in 1972 and used in 1974 to recover
pieces of a sunken Soviet submarine in the Pacific. These ships are
supposed to be seaworthy on a 30 to 120 days' notice.
   Except for the Ready Reserve, which is spread out across the
country, the fleet is located at Fort Eustis, near Norfolk; at
Beaumont, Texas; and at Suisun Bay near San Francicso.
   Here on the James River, the huge vessels sit quietly with their
rusted and broken railings, the silence disturbed only by the sound
of shoes crunching the paint flakes that litter the decks.
   Many of the ships were activated to carry cargo during the
Vietnam War, and during a recent tour of the ships, a reporter
observed that log books, maps and navigational charts used during
Vietnam were still in bookcases on the bridge.
   Inside the compartments below deck, there are old mattresses on
the metal bunk beds, dusty lockers, mess halls with the chairs still
at dining tables, crank-style telephones, steel cooking pots, and
even small mementos like a pocket-sized prayer book.
   Kaskin, who works in the Pentagon, said the size of the fleet is
set by the cargo requirements of moving Army equipment _ but not
troops _ to a theoretical conflict in the Middle East.
   The Maritime Administration's Delpercio said there have been 60
tests to activate ships in the fleet since 1977, and only four were
total failures. He said one or two times, ships failed to sail in
the specified time period. All except two of the tests, however,
involved the Ready Reserve.
   Raymond Ramsay, a former Navy maritime affairs official, agreed
that the appearance of the ships could be improved. But he said the
real test would be the workings of the engines, boilers, gaskets,
pipes, hydraulic systems and other parts that make a ship run.
   ``It's like buying a used car,'' he said. ``The paint and polish
might be great, but you have to use it for a while. It would be a
shame to run on a gamble and lose a whole ship.''

   Half a world away from home, where gunfire and
bloodshed shocked the world a year ago, a small group of Chinese
exiles works to reform the political system that forced them to flee.
   The world headquarters for the Federation for a Democratic China
is a small office in a quiet, picturesque Paris neighborhood.
   It tries to maintain pressure on the Communist government in
Beijing by urging other governments to take political measures,
publishing materials on human rights and keeping track of friends
and ex-colleagues in Chinese jails.
   The idea is to nudge the Communist Party toward peaceful
political reform, says Wan Runnan, the federation's
secretary-general.
   ``The Communist Party cannot carry out necessary reform from
within,'' Wan says. ``We must put pressure on the party from the
outside to adopt democracy, including from foreign governments.''
   The federation does not seek to overthrow the party, Wan says.
``But what people want is economic and social stability, without
corruption in the party, and the best way to avoid this is a
multiparty system,'' he says.
   A year ago Wan Runnan was a rare breed _ a successful, elite
businessman who headed Stone Group Co., China's largest privately
funded company. But Wan lent his support, as well as staffers and
equipment, to the student-led movement for democratic reforms in
Beijing last spring.
   The Chinese army's violent June 4 suppression of the unarmed
protesters left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead.
   Six days later, while Wan was visiting a computer exhibition in
Hong Kong, Chinese authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and
six other intellectuals, accusing them of inciting the
``counterrevolutionary turmoil.'' Wan never returned.
   Today he leads a humbler life in France, directing the
federation's protests of human rights violations, organizing
discussions and conferences on the massacre and helping a now
abandoned project to broadcast pro-democracy messages into China.
   The federation's chairman is Yan Jiaqi, a former aide to ousted
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   It is staffed by a dozen Chinese and has 2,000 dues-paying
members in its branches around the world. Fees are nominal, only
about $10 a year.
   Yan's often stiff demeanor has helped shift the spotlight to his
deputy chairman, Wu'er Kaixi, the flamboyant, articulate former
student leader who relishes media attention and has a penchant for
fainting at public gatherings.
   Yan and Wu'er frequently travel outside France, leaving Wan in
charge in Paris.
   But Wan does some traveling himself, recently visiting
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland.
   ``The events in China of last spring had two strong effects on
East Europe,'' he says. ``People saw the widespread participation of
ordinary citizens, and governments witnessed the suppression, which
could only make them more sensitive to their own problems.''
   Details of the federation's budget were not readily available
during a recent interview. But Wang Hao, secretary of finance, says
there is a ``plan de finance.'' It costs about $38,000 a month to
run the office itself, including rent and staff salaries, he says.
   The federation in its infancy was beset by its share of
controversy. There have been allegations of financial mismanagement,
overzealous spending by Wu'er and discord among its leaders.
   Exiled journalist Liu Binyan said in New York last week that he
had been asked to take over the federation from Yan in September,
but that he refused, noting the prickly relations among the leaders.
   The federation, while it boasts most of the prominent dissident
names, is not the sole voice of dissent, competing with the China
Alliance for Democracy in New York, and the Washington, D.C.-based
Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars. The three
were told to consolidate their offices if they wanted continued
support from the U.S. government, according to Chinese sources in
the United States.
   The entire movement-in-exile was given a boost in April when Chai
Ling, the impassioned student activist who headed the protest
movement in its final days last June, surfaced with her husband in
Paris in April after 10 months on the run.
   Federation members insist gradual reform will come to China. ``If
China doesn't adopt democracy, then the country has no hope,'' says
Zhang Lun, an aide to federation chairman Yan.
   A 28-year-old former instructor of political science at Beijing
University of Geography, Zhang advised the students at Tiananmen
Square.
   He escaped from China late last year using the ``underground
railroad'' that spirited several activists from the country.
   Now he receives a monthly $180 refugee allowance from the French
government and wants to study sociology. He says, however, he can't
abandon the hopes and friends he left behind.
   ``I know many, many people who were arrested,'' he says, wincing.
``I just hope they can see daylight again.''

   Now that Seoul's ties with Moscow are
improving, so many South Koreans want to take Russian that there
aren't enough teachers to go around, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Russian language courses at private institutes are crowded with
college students and company employees, and Russian textbooks are a
lucrative market for publishers, the Korea Herald said.
   The paper said the boom was ignited by the Soviet participation
in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul and subsequent economic and other
exchanges between the countries, even though they have yet to
establish diplomatic relations.
   Presidents Roh Tae-woo and Mikhai S. Gorbachev are to meet Monday
in San Francisco.
   Despite the lack of native Russian speakers in South Korea, many
leading business groups and private language schools began Russian
study programs this year, the newspaper said.

   About 150 youths rioted at a multinational

news agency ADN said Saturday.
   Four people were arrested in the violence late Friday night, ADN
said.
   The crowd threw rocks, bottles and other objects at the culture

<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
was the Democratic Party's nominee for the highest office in the
land. Today, he isn't even a headline act at his own state's party
convention.
   Dukakis was set to address the convention this morning in the
notably unprestigious leadoff slot. But that speech was postponed
and the entire convention was delayed Saturday morning by a police
picket line that convention participants didn't want to cross.
   Local police are negotiating a new contract and picketed the
convention when contract talks fell through.
   His name doesn't even appear on the agenda of the convention, a
gathering he dominated through much of his three decades in
Massachusetts politics.
   His aides have shown little bitterness over his stature at this
year's convention. But the governor's press handlers made a
conscious effort to avoid drawing attention to the speech, which was
billed as a brief address, or moving the governor toward center
stage.
   Two summers ago in Atlanta, Dukakis, a three-term governor, stood
before the national convention as the Democratic presidential
nominee, ahead of George Bush in the polls and riding a wave of
successes in the Democratic primaries.
   Today, Bush is president, basking in popularity and the glow from
his continuing summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. In
Massachusetts, state finances are in disarray, and Dukakis'
popularity is at rock-bottom. Democratic candidates avoid him.
   ``Politics is very unforgiving, especially in Massachusetts,''
said James French, a longtime Dukakis ally and one of a dwindling
number of aides to stay on in the last months of the governor's
administration. Dukakis leaves office in January.
   And yet, like Jimmy Carter, who disappeared from the lips of
Democrats after he lost his 1980 presidential re-election bid,
Dukakis hopes the years will give him back the high standing he once
enjoyed in Massachusetts.
   ``Just as Jimmy Carter, in his many years out of office, has
become America's best ex-president, and its best-loved president,
the same will hold true for Dukakis at the statewide level,'' French
said.
   It would be a major rehabilitation.
   An opinion poll gave Dukakis an unfavorable rating of 73 percent.
And as the state budget situation has grown worse in recent months,
Dukakis has been able to do little to dig himself out of that hole.
   The four Democrats running for governor are basing their
candidacies on undoing the fiscal wrongs of the Dukakis
administration. Even Dukakis' own lieutenant governor, Evelyn
Murphy, has emphasized the points on which she disagrees with her
boss.
   Dukakis launched his statewide career with a surprisingly strong
second-place finish in balloting for attorney general in 1966.
   Four years later, in a bid for lieutenant governor, Dukakis
wrested the convention endorsement by tirelessly talking to each and
every one of thousands of delegates in their homes and offices. His
opponent in that race, state Sen. Beryl Cohen, tried to win
delegates by wooing party leaders.
   Dukakis lost that race. But in 1974 _ a year when there was no
convention held _ he won the governorship. In 1978, another year
without a convention, he lost a primary race to a Democratic
gubernatorial challenger. But at the 1982 and 1986 conventions, it
was all Dukakis.
   ``The conventions throughout the 1980s have been a Michael
Dukakis show,'' French said.
   French said Dukakis hopes and expects that time will be on his
side.
   ``He's been at the very top and he's also experienced the very
worst and he realizes that people's judgments will be formulated
three or four years from now,'' French said. ``He's very optimistic
as most of us are.''

<HEAD>Americans Want to Do It All With Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether it's making money, spreading democracy
or boosting morale, Americans want to do it with the Soviet Union _
and they weren't shy about exploiting the summit to say so.
   Fax machines whirred throughout summit week with announcements
from investors and philanthropists and educators eager to publicize
their new partnerships.
   ``Everybody is trying to use the summit to promote their
projects. This is obvious. This is capitalism,'' says Edward
Lozansky, an emigre physicist setting up a Soviet-American
University in Moscow and the United States.
   One company that lucked out was Radisson Hotels International.
The Minneapolis firm has signed an agreement with Intourist, the
Soviet travel agency, to operate the first American-managed hotel
and business center in the Soviet Union.
   Long before the summit was announced, Radisson and Intourist
scheduled the signing for May 22. ``It worked out very nicely for
us. It couldn't have been nicer,'' said Jeurgen Bartels, president
of Carlson Hospitality Group Inc., Radisson's parent company.
   Radisson billed the project as ``a historic joint venture'' and
said the 165-office business center would offer the first commercial
direct-dial telephones and fax machines in Moscow.
   The new marble building, designed by a team of Soviets and
Yugoslavians, also has 430 hotel rooms. It was nearly complete when
Radisson came on board and is expected to open in December.
   Lozansky's Soviet-American University was formally announced at a
summit-week reception. He said the event netted a raft of business
executives offering money and a top Soviet scientist anxious to
discuss joint research projects.
   Roland Schmitt, president of Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in
Troy, N.Y., acknowledged that ``the idea is in a very early and very
nascent stage.''
   Lozansky admits the summit sped up the announcement ``a little
bit'' but says he has enough money to launch the private university
_ the first in the Soviet Union _ this fall.
   He said five Soviet professors will teach at U.S. universities
and five American professors will lecture up to 75 Soviet students
at Moscow State University. Eventually the school will grant its own
degrees, he said, and next year maybe there will be enough money for
a separate building in Moscow.
   Lozansky, who was forced out of his job and his country for
publicly criticizing the government, said educating Soviet students
American-style is a way to nudge the Soviet Union toward democracy.
``We want to pull them further and maybe a little bit faster,'' he
says.
   Among the other U.S.-Soviet ventures that surfaced during summit
week were the American edition of Commersant, the first Soviet
business weekly; Operation USA-USSR, a global relief organization
that will send teams of U.S. and Soviet doctors to work in
developing countries; and the Heart-to-Heart Association, a
partnership between Soviet television and TV preacher Robert
Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Ministries.
   Heart-to-Heart's first project is a remarkable one given the
Soviet Union's purportedly atheistic nature: a series of 12 monthly
sermons from Schuller, to be broadcast to the Soviet Union's 200
million people in prime time.
   Schuller, host of the popular ``Hour of Power'' program,
delivered televised messages to the Soviet people in December and
May at the request of Soviet TV authorities. In the new climate of
religious tolerance, they did not seem to mind Schuller's Biblical
themes and numerous references to God.
   Neither did long-suffering Soviet citizens under economic siege.
Apparently starved for religion and moral support, they deluged the
government with appreciative calls. Schuller ended up with an
invitation to be a regular.
   Why?
   ``I'm not known for preaching a sectarian dogmatism,'' Schuller
said. ``They (the Soviets) were aware that the thrust of my message
is building people up and giving them encouragement. I offer
practical help for daily living through spiritual power. That's
exactly what they need at this point. They say it and I agree with
them.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the first Soviet
leader to visit California since Nikita Khrushchev's tour de farce
in 1959, has more serious business in mind than his fun-seeking
predecessor.
   Gorbachev, scheduled to arrive Sunday night after four days of
summit talks with President Bush and a quick visit to Minnesota, has
a packed agenda highlighted by a historic first meeting with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   Khrushchev's trip to the Golden State was a little less weighty _
a dinner with Marilyn Monroe and other Hollywood stars, an impromptu
jaunt around San Francisco after eluding security guards, and a
memorable fit when he was denied a day pass to Disneyland.
   ``What do you have there, rocket launch pads?'' he fumed. So
angry was Khrushchev about missing Mickey Mouse and suffering other
perceived insults by his American hosts that he reportedly
considered severing relations between the superpowers.
   That was in the chilly days of the Cold War. In this era of
glasnost, perestroika and crumbling communism, Gorbachev will be
allowed where few Soviets have ever been permitted _ into the heart
of Silicon Valley.
   Khrushchev visited International Business Machines Corp.'s San
Jose plant and ate a 49-cent fried chicken special with workers in
the cafeteria. Gorbachev will venture only as far into the valley as
Stanford University for a speech and meeting with scholars and
students.
   Gorbachev's speech at Stanford and his agenda in San Francisco
are expected to focus on Pacific Rim politics and big business as he
turns from the issues of European security and strategic arms that
dominated his talks with Bush.
   Except for a brief excursion to view the Golden Gate Bridge at
day's end, Gorbachev will leave most of the sightseeing to his wife,
Raisa, during a whirlwind, 22-hour visit that includes a luncheon
with 150 West Coast executives.
   Gorbachev's meeting with the captains of industry, including the
leaders of Chevron Corp., BankAmerica Corp., AT&amp;T, Hewlett-Packard
Co., and more than 100 other major companies, is in sharp contrast
to Khrushchev's unscheduled visit to the hiring hall of the
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.
   Khrushchev was cheered by the workers. Gorbachev is likely to be
applauded enthusiastically by the executives, who see opportunities
for trade in the opening markets of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   The Soviet president also will renew his friendship with former
President Reagan over coffee Monday morning at the home of the
Soviet consul general in San Francisco, where the Gorbachevs are
staying.
   The Soviet flag is flying at San Francisco City Hall for the
first time since Khrushchev's visit, and boats along Fisherman's
Wharf are expected to hoist the hammer and sickle for Mrs.
Gorbachev's tour.
   Not everyone is thrilled about the visit. Wherever the Soviet
president goes he'll pass demonstrators _ Armenians, Lithuanians,
Estonians, Latvians, Palestinians, and Eritreans from embattled
Ethiopia _ who are upset about Soviet policies.
   Gorbachev, plagued by economic and political woes, apparently
will use his California trip to promote the Soviet Union as a
Pacific Rim trading partner with West Coast companies and to improve
relations with South Korea, longtime foe of Soviet-backed North
Korea.
   His meeting with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo was a late
addition to the schedule. But it promises to be a dramatic and
significant event that could have a profound effect on both their
countries.
   Besides being a big step toward the establishment of diplomatic
ties between Moscow and Seoul and a prelude to eventual
reunification of the Korean peninsula, the meeting could affect
Soviet-Japanese relations, said Soviet watcher David Holloway of
Stanford.
   ``As the Soviet Union puts more emphasis on its trade
relationship with South Korea it also puts more pressure on Japan
... It's a way of telling the Japanese they're missing out on
something and it might encourage them to break their deadlock in
negotiations with the Soviets,'' said Holloway, a political
scientist who briefed President Bush before his first summit with
Gorbachev.
   Soviet-South Korean trade doubled to $600 million last year and
is expected to surpass $1 billion in 1990. South Korea has the
manufacturing expertise and high-tech products the Soviets need and
are a good, close market for Soviet resources.
   For two years, South Korea has sought to build ties with
Communist nations able to influence Communist North Korea. Since
that ``Northern Policy'' went into effect in July 1988, South Korea
has established formal diplomatic relations with every nation in
eastern Europe except Albania, East Germany and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Some of California's Best Wines For Gorbachev Luncheon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of California's finest wines and
gourmet foods will be served Monday to the 150 capitalists who will
lunch with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. For the
teetotaling Russian leader, however, the drink of choice will be
still mineral water.
   Hours of tasting, deliberating and negotiating by representatives
of the Soviet Consulate and San Francisco Chamber of Commerce went
into decisions on the five-star feast of food and wine.
   ``It's an all-American menu,'' said Ernest Brandner, the Fairmont
Hotel's head of food and beverages. Not so American, however, as to
include hamburgers, put in a hotel spokesman.
   ``No, he's already had enough of that in Moscow,'' he said,
referring to the recent opening of a huge McDonald's hamburger
restaurant.
   The Gorbachev banquet will be in the Venetian Room, where the
hotel's most elegant dinner shows have been staged for years.
   Brandner estimated 40 to 50 cooks will be on duty for the event,
under the direction of Kurt Kratschmar.
   The reception will be served hors d'oeuvres of smoked salmon on
pumpernickel and Dungeness crab legs on endive. The wine will be
Iron Horse champagnes from Sonoma County.
   The appetizer course will be lobster medallions with greens and
butterflied salmon with vinaigrette dressing, served with Raymond
1987 private reserve chardonnay of Napa Valley.
   For the main course, the entree will be a Gorbachev favorite _
roast rack of Sonoma baby lamb with pinot noir sauce and vegetables
and new potatoes. The wine will be Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi 1987
private reserve pinot noir.
   Dessert will be chocolate tulips with berries and a 1987
Schramsberg champagne of Napa Valley.

<TEXT>
   The United States is expected to make a strong
pitch this coming week for nations of Latin America and the
Caribbean to reduce their trade barriers.
   President Bush is sending Special Trade Representative Carla
Hills to a meeting in Paraguay of the Organization of American
States to outline U.S. thoughts on how the region can overcome its
dismal economic performance the past decade.
   In an interview Friday, Hills said she plans to stress lower
trade barriers and establishing favorable foreign investment
climates as two keys to the region's economic recovery.
   ``Investment will flow where climate is most hospitable,'' she
said, adding that a number of countries have begun to scrap policies
that have crippled growth in the past. ``There have been substantial
changes this year.''
   Other officials have cited Mexico, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Venezuela
and Chile as countries which have initiated pro-growth policies.
   The 1980s have frequently been described as Latin America's
``lost decade'' because of the steep economic decline that occurred
in almost all countries in the region.
   Hills will be accompanied to the annual OAS conclave of member
nation's foreign ministers by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger. They were due to arrive Saturday night in the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion.
   Eagleburger is standing in for Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, who will be in Europe during the consultations.
   Baker's top aide for Latin America, Assistant Secretary of State
Bernard Aronson, also is not attending the OAS meeting. He plans to
go to Rome for a meeting next week of more than 20 donor countries
for a discussion on ways to help Nicaragua overcome its economic
crisis.
   Hills will meet starting Sunday night with several of the six
hemispheric presidents planning to participate in the discussions,
which are taking place on the 100th anniversary of the first
inter-American conference.
   Recent OAS meetings have become bogged down over disputes on
Panama and the overall Central American question. With those issues
largely resolved, an unusually small number of divisive political
questions are on the agenda this year.
   Last year OAS delegates spent most of their energies grappling
with the political crisis in Panama. This year they will be able to
focus more on issues such as drugs, trade, foreign debt and the
environment, U.S. officials said.
   Delegates also will discuss ways of promoting the scheduled
transition to democratic rule in Haiti this year.
   Underscoring the relative harmony in the hemisphere these days is
the fact that virtually all 32 OAS members have elected presidents.
Paraguay is hosting its first OAS meeting, a recognition of the
replacement of 35 years of military rule last year by an elected
government.
   Hills will address the meeting at Monday's opening session and
visit Brazil and Argentina afterwards.

<HEAD>Attorneys Still Bargaining as Mayor Barry Drug Trial Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's defense attorneys kept up
bargaining with prosecutors over the weekend as they prepared for
the start of his trial on charges of cocaine possession and perjury.
   Jury selection was scheduled to start Monday barring negotiation
of a last-minute plea bargain in the talks between Barry's attorneys
and federal prosecutors.
   The 54-year-old mayor last week appeared determined to see the
case through in the courtroom rather than accept an agreement that
would require him to plead guilty to felony charges.
   But sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the two sides continued to explore the possibility
of an agreement.
   The case marks the low point in Barry's stormy tenure as mayor.
His latest troubles arise from his visits to the hotel room of
former city employee Charles Lewis in December 1988. Lewis pleaded
guilty last year to conspiring to buy at least $140 worth of crack
cocaine for the mayor.
   Information from Lewis led federal investigators to one-time
model Rasheeda Moore, whose role in an FBI sting operation led to
Barry's arrest.
   Barry visited her hotel room Jan. 18 while FBI cameras taped the
mayor smoking crack cocaine supplied by an FBI agent posing as a
friend of Moore.
   He is charged with possession of cocaine and perjury for lying to
a federal grand jury about his involvement with drugs.
   The videotape is the centerpiece of the government's 14-count
case alleging possession of cocaine on numerous occasions since 1984.
   ``I've seen this videotape, and the tape is more damaging to the
government than to me,'' Barry said in an interview with The
Washington Post. He admitted smoking crack but said the government
had tried to kill him by providing a potentially lethal dose.
   Barry has not said whether he will run for a fourth, four-year
term in November. A recent poll shows that his legal problems have
not significantly eroded his political support.
   Whatever happens, Barry already has had a remarkable career.
   Born into a family of sharecroppers in Itta Bena, Miss., Barry
grew up in Memphis, Tenn., and joined the civil rights movement
while a college student.
   He organized the first lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville, Tenn.,
and became the first national chairman of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, which engaged in demonstrations and boycotts.
   He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1965, where he led a one-day
boycott of the D.C. transit system. He fought for replacing
congressional control of the District of Columbia with a limited
form of home rule.
   Barry designed a program to aid Washington's black poor called
Youth Pride. It received millions of dollars in grants from the U.S.
Labor Department and operated a series of small businesses.
   It was his ties to Youth Pride that created Barry's first brush
with scandal. His first wife, Mary Treadwell, went to jail after
being convicted of embezzling money from the organization. She now
draws a city salary for serving on a parole board. Barry was not
charged in the investigation.
   Barry won election to both the school board and the City Council.
He was elected mayor in 1978.
   He dealt with a city financial crisis in his first term. A second
term was marked by a renewal of the downtown area and declines in
crime and unemployment. But his administration has been beset by
scandal.
   The mayor's chief aide went to prison for defrauding the
government of nearly $200,000 and 12 other city officials have been
convicted of various crimes. The former head of the D.C. human
services department and a businessman are on now on trial in the
same federal courthouse for allegedly steering city contracts to
favored companies.
   Prosecutors have investigated Barry before. The government closed
out one probe in 1985, after trying unsuccessfully to prove that
Barry lied to a grand jury when he denied obtaining cocaine from a
former city employee.

<HEAD>Soviets Produce Little That Americans Want _ Except Luxuries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-Soviet trade agreement offers the
potential of billions of dollars in economic benefits for both
countries, but trade experts said Saturday that the Soviets now
produce precious little that interests Americans.
   The exceptions are well known _ vodka, caviar and luxury furs _
and for those items prices are expected to drop. That will give
American consumers their very own perestroika dividend, once
Congress gets around to ratifying the pact and a companion measure
granting the Soviets most-favored-nation trade status.
   For now, trade analysts see the agreement as a badly needed
public relations boost for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
bestowing on him the economic prize he had most sought from his
summit with President Bush.
   Gorbachev wanted the accord to demonstrate that, despite his
problems at home, he still could negotiate economic concessions from
the West.
   In some respects, Gorbachev's U.S. trip could be viewed as an
extended trade mission. His stops from Washington to Minnesota and
California were planned to afford him a chance to court potential
U.S. business investors.
   But analysts said daunting problems remain before either the
number of U.S. companies doing business in the Soviet Union or the
modest U.S.-Soviet trade increases to any great extent.
   ``If you look at the structure of their imports, they really
don't have a lot of things that we want to buy,'' said Donald
Bowles, an expert on the Soviet economy at American University.
   ``They are still heavily dependent on raw materials exports,''
Bowles said. ``They are only able to sell manufactured goods in the
Third World, which is willing to settle for less quality.''
   The Soviet Union is one of the few countries with which the
United States, beset with its own trade problems, is running a trade
surplus. Last year, it amounted to $3.57 billion. The United States
exported $4.27 billion worth of goods, primarily grain, to the
Soviet Union. That was offset by a small $703 million in Soviet
sales here.
   Duties on Soviet products are as much as 10 times higher than
imports from other countries. Economists said that once the Soviets
gain the lower tariffs promised by the trade agreement, Soviet
exports, especially of luxury consumer goods, are bound to rise.
   With the most-favored-nation tariffs, the price of a bottle of
vodka is expected to drop by about $1.10. Tariffs on sable furs
would fall to 8 percent, down from the current 50 percent. The
tariff on Russian caviar would drop to 15 percent, half the current
30 percent levy.
   The trade agreement also would make it easier for U.S. companies
to set up shop in the Soviet Union, a largely untapped market of 300
million people.
   Joseph Pelzman, an economist at George Washington University,
said he expected the Soviet experience would be similar to that of
the Chinese, who were awarded the lower most-favored-nation trade
tariffs in the early 1980s and now enjoy a $6.18 billion trade
surplus with the United States.
   The trade agreement is a necessary first step for a presidential
waiver of the high tariffs mandated by the 1974 Jackson-Vanik
amendment, passed by Congress to penalize the Soviet Union for its
restrictions on the emigration of Jews and other dissidents.
   The administration has said it will not send the trade agreement
or the Jackson-Vanik waiver to Congress until the Supreme Soviet
passes a free emigration law, something that Soviet officials say is
imminent.
   Many members of Congress say that is not enough. They charged
that the administration should have stuck to an earlier position of
not offering a trade deal unless Gorbachev lifted the economic
blockade of Lithuania.
   Pelzman said those who linked a trade agreement to Lithuania
missed a key point. ``The Baltic republics are likely to be the
first to take advantage of the expanded trade opportunities,'' he
said. ``They are the closest to Western markets and their business
acumen is better.''
   The administration, meanwhile, was lobbied heavily by American
business interests, anxious not to be left behind in the rush to get
a foothold in the Soviet Union.
   William Archey, a former top trade official in the Reagan
administration and now vice president for international relations at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Bush's decision to sign the trade
agreement reflected a new realism about America's status in the
world.
   ``The day has long passed since the United States can
unilaterally engage in economic sanctions in any form,'' he said.
``The United States does not dominate the world economy any more and
it is time we came to realize that.''

<TEXT>
   H.R. Haldeman, a former Nixon aide who went to
jail because of the Watergate scandal, is among the business and
agricultural leaders who will meet with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Sunday.
   Haldeman recently helped the Minneapolis-based Radisson Hotels
International chain get approval to start a hotel in Moscow. It will
be the first U.S.-managed hotel in the Soviet Union.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich's administration said Friday after the guest
list of 145 names was made public that Haldeman was not one of the
suggested names it submitted to the Soviets but was added by them.
The meeting will be at the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis.
   Haldeman was in Moscow last month to take part in a signing
ceremony during a meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council. He and former astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin were
representing Americom International Corp., an office technology
concern in Irvine, Calif., which will operate the hotel along with
Radisson.
   Haldeman was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy
in the Watergate burglary and coverup and served 18 months in
prison. The scandal forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency.
   While in Moscow, Haldeman expressed his admiration for Gorbachev,
making an implied comparison to his former boss.
   ``I can only say having observed one politician very closely with
a remarkable ability for survival and recovery, and watching
Gorbachev, I have utmost admiration for his political skills,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   West German politicians Saturday
praised the arms agreements reached at the superpower summit, but
regretted that no progress was reported on the issue of which
military alliance a united Germany should join.
   The politicians also said the summit in Washington showed that
the Warsaw Pact and NATO alliances are ready to take on important
political roles.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said it is important that
the United States and Soviets find a new level of relations.
   ``When the United States and the Soviet Union declare that they
no longer find one a threat to the other _ which is a correct
conclusion _ then that must also apply for the alliances,'' Genscher
told Hesse state radio.
   ``This means the alliances are ripe for politican functions, for
a political disarmament function, a political disarmament control
function and to help build a cooperative structure of security in
Europe,'' he said.
   Genscher said that an important related aspect to the summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
that ``the Soviets can trust that a united Germany will be a
meaningful and constructive partner'' in a future European security
system.
   Bush and Gorbachev on Friday signed the foundation of a landmark
treaty for the first cuts in strategic nuclear missiles and a pact
to slash chemical weapons stockpiles. Their summit ends Sunday.
   Horst Ehmke, a deputy chairman of the opposition Social Democrats
in the West German Parliament, praised the summit for furthering
disarmament and improving bilateral relations.
   ``We see this an important step toward further reduction of
strategic nuclear weapons, complete elimination of medium-range
weapons and the total worldwide ban of chemical weapons,'' Ehmke
said in a statement to the media.
   However, he said it was ``regretful'' that the two leaders had
not made any apparent progress on the question of the military
security status of a future united Germany.
   ``It is becoming ever clearer that finding a satisfactory
solution for everyone in this question is difficult,'' Ehmke said.
   Gorbachev has proposed handing the German unity and alliance
issue to a European council that would meet annually with U.S. and
Soviet participation. The council would be made up of the 35
Western, neutral and Eastern states that now make up the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   The United States, which wants a united Germany to become a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has agreed to hold
further discussions on the Gorbachev proposal after the summit.
   Top diplomatic aides from both sides are to meet in Copenhagen,
Denmark, to discuss the German question next week, and again in
Berlin two weeks later.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In six months, Yugoslavia has achieved a
quiet revolution. No walls and only a few Communist leaders fell,
but four-digit inflation ended, the currency is convertible and the
foreign debt is shrinking.
   Daunting challenges remain, however, from achieving political
stability to reforming money-losing state enterprises.
   Federal elections are likely by year's end and Premier Ante
Markovic, popular as the architect of reform, is promoting himself
as head of a new coalition government. He says he may give up his
Communist membership and form his own party.
   Political revolt has pushed economic change elsewhere in Eastern
Europe, but U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann noted last week that
in Yugoslavia, ``major change in the economy has been driving
political reform.''
   Markovic, 65, who became premier in March last year, is the first
politician who may acquire national authority similar to that of
Josip Broz Tito, who died a decade ago.
   Since Tito's death, regional leaders have tended to have the
highest standing in Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six republics
and two autonomous provinces. But opinion polls in Serbia, Slovenia
and Croatia, the three most influential republics, rank Markovic
second only to the regions' leaders.
   Those three republics are at odds politically.
   Non-Communists who favor secession from Yugoslavia have won free
elections in Slovenia and Croatia. Serbia's conservative Communists
have refused to follow the other five republics in legalizing
opposition parties, and cling to the concept of strong federal rule.
   Because he has performed what a Western diplomat termed ``near
miracles'' in the economy, Markovic appears to have a chance of
bypassing regional disputes and forging national consensus.
   His success rests partly on popular weariness with Communist
leaders who could not halt annual inflation of more than 1,000
percent or ease unemployment, which is 15 percent nationwide and far
higher in the impoverished south.
   Markovic became premier in March 1989 after the economic crisis
forced out Branko Mikulic. Markovic acted on the economic front in
December after consulting Western experts.
   He tied the dinar to the West German mark, creating the first
fully convertible currency in Eastern Europe.
   The foreign debt has fallen from $23 billion to $16 billion and
foreign investment is up, encouraged by laws drafted on Markovic's
recommendation even before he became premier.
   About 1,100 new joint ventures involving 1 billion West German
marks _ $600 million _ were started between January 1989 and April
1990.
   By lopping four zeros off the old dinar to create the new,
convertible currency, Markovic slashed prices that had risen to
dizzying heights each day.
   In February, the Belgrade stock exchange resumed trading for the
first time in nearly 50 years.
   Vuk Hamovic, one of the new private entrepreneurs in Belgrade,
described the premier as ``the only bright spot in the idiotic
situation in Yugoslavia.''
   Hamovic joins many others in predicting that if Markovic forms a
new political organization, ``everybody will vote for that party.''
   The euphoria may be premature. Markovic has yet to take some of
the most difficult steps: reforming and unifying a labyrinthine tax
system, changing ownership laws and closing big bankrupt state
enterprises.
   ``When I see the first big firm with over 1,000 employees shut
down, then I'll believe in the future,'' a Belgrade businessman said
on condition of anonymity.
   Markovic has promised to announce more reforms by the end of
June. Yugoslav sources and Western diplomats believe they may
involve the greatest effort in Eastern Europe so far to transfer
ownership from the state to managers and workers.
   Reports say up to 70 percent of state-owned firms could pass into
the hands of their workers, who would buy shares.
   It is not clear how freely such shares could be traded, if at
all. The stock market is just being born and many bank managers are
unskilled in assessing risks.
   Another difficulty is determining how much a company is worth.
The Energoprojekt construction group, one of Yugoslavia's biggest
firms, tried it before forming a holding company a year ago to
manage its 10 companies.
   Vice president Milan Djelic said a British firm, which he did not
name, will have to be brought in to do the job again before
Energoprojekt can proceed with plans for managers to buy shares,
which it also wants to offer abroad.
   Yugoslavia starts with some advantages in the economic conversion
of Eastern Europe.
   In 1965, it became the first Communist nation to give state firms
some autonomy. Free travel to the West has been allowed for 20
years, and millions of Yugoslavs have worked abroad.
   Tourism has brought Western visitors. Movies from the West, shown
in the original language, are the most popular.
   Yugoslavs, stylish and freewheeling, have more ideas than any
other East Europeans about what a modern Western economy entails.
   ``Make money, not war'' is the capitalist message beamed to firms
invited to advertise on Belgrade's lively third television channel.

   Flood victims found that having next to
nothing didn't mean they had nothing to lose.
   A month after floodwaters soaked this town of 300, the deluge
elderly residents call the worst in memory is far from forgotten,
with soggy reminders bearing silent witness to the destruction
virtually everywhere.
   Ruined furniture, appliances and clothes are stacked in piles in
front of stricken houses. Windows stand open to help interiors dry
out. Wooden floors are warped and smell of mildew.
   Roy Roberts' auto salvage yard reeks heavily of diesel fumes as
workers clean car engines that not long ago were submerged in 4 feet
of water.
   Two blocks away, the Moffett school secretary works at a desk
bearing a 16-inch-high stripe of stains showing where floodwaters
lapped against the side.
   The modest community where the salvage yard is the most prominent
business may have suffered irreparable harm when the Arkansas River
spilled from its banks, officials say.
   Many residents say they cannot afford even low-interest disaster
loans, and officials say about 80 percent of the homes are rented,
which rules out federal grants to repair housing.
   But Moffett, described by one state official as a ``poor, second
cousin'' to Fort Smith, Ark., isn't a nowhere town residents are
eager to flee.
   ``I'm crazy about this place,'' said 89-year-old George Hargrave.
``I don't consider home anyplace but here.''
   Roberts said Moffett thrived in the 1940s and 1950s with grocery
stores, service stations and three or four nightclubs that made the
town off-limits to soldiers stationed at Fort Chaffee in Fort Smith.
   But old Highway 64 gave way to Interstate 40, about 3 miles north
of Moffett, and the town slowly ``fell off the map,'' he said.
   Longtime residents say there have been other floods, but none so
severe. After heavy spring rains, runoff from eastern Oklahoma lakes
caused the Arkansas River to swell over its banks and into Moffett.
   The American Red Cross immediately opened an outreach center and
went door-to-door looking for those in need, spending more than
$135,000 on 95 families, said spokeswoman Franci Hart.
   Sequoyah County was declared a disaster area and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has taken over. But FEMA relief for most
residents will be limited.
   ``Some will be able to get repair loans, some can't afford a loan
of any size,'' said state Social Services Secretary Robert Fulton.
``A lot of the houses are rented, so the landlords have got the
problem of fixing them up. And there are questions whether the
landlords can carry a loan.''
   Dell Greer, deputy coordinator of FEMA's Oklahoma field office,
said some who cannot repay loans may be eligible for up to $10,400
in federal grants to replace personal property.
   Sally Armstrong has lived in Moffett for 68 years. Her floor and
carpeting suffered the worst flood damage at her home, which she
moved back into on Wednesday after receiving a FEMA grant of $2,576.
   ``It's not enough but I'll have to stretch it and make it
enough,'' Mrs. Armstrong said. ``I don't want a loan because there's
no way I could pay it back.''
   FEMA grants to repair houses are limited to the owners, Greer
said.
   Roberts owns eight houses in Moffett. He has begun repairs on hot
water heaters and said he will clean up the debris the best he can.
None of the homes built in the 1940s rents for more than $100 a
month, he said.
   ``I probably couldn't apply for a loan, but I'd take a grant,''
he said. As for his tenants, he said, ``I'm sure they'll get some
help.''
   Greer said it was unclear whether the $10,400 limit applies to
each property or each owner. FEMA provides temporary housing for
tenants whose rental homes are unlivable, he said.
   For many, that would mean leaving Moffett.
   ``We lost everything but our lives, but I'm going to try to hang
around here,'' Hargrave said. ``I've been in Moffett so long. I'm
not leaving.''
   Earl Oxford, pastor at the Baptist Church in Moffett, remains
busy attending to repairs and consoling his flock. Floodwaters
buckled the floor at the church where about 50 people attend
services.
   Free clothing was displayed outside the church for those unable
to replace clothes lost in the flood.
   ``Most of the people are still getting over the shock,'' Oxford
said. ``A lot of them are not going to get their homes fixed. A lot
of them can't be fixed. If they were renting, they lost everything.''
   Moffett was not the only Oklahoma community to suffer from the
record flooding, but Fulton said the town with next-to-nothing may
have had the most to lose.
   ``It seemed along the Red River, the flooding was to second
homes, to lake homes,'' he said. ``This was a permanent community,
already poor, that got hit hard.''

   Many Soviets agreed Saturday that President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev deserved praise for his foreign policy achievements at
the summit, but some said he didn't deserve humanitarian awards and
doubted his trip would improve their lives.
   ``Shame! Again he has sold out all Russia!'' one woman shouted to
a sidewalk crowd around her on Pushkin Square, a kind of Moscow
``speaker's corner'' a few blocks from the Kremlin.
   She was referring to the five American humanitarian awards
Gorbachev received Friday in Washington for striving for peace and
freedom.
   Her comments reflected the contrast between Gorbachev's wild
popularity abroad _ where he is treated like a hero for loosening up
Soviet society and helping bring peace and democracy to many parts
of the world _ and his unpopularity at home, where he is accused of
ruining the economy and stifling freedom.
   The woman said she was from Lvov in the Ukraine but refused to
give her name ``for a variety of reasons.'' Many Soviets believe
Gorbachev's glasnost, or openness, campaign is limited and they are
fearful of being quoted in the foreign press.
   A man in the crowd explained many people's mixed views of
Gorbachev's foreign trips.
   ``He did much on the international arena, he earned points. But
in domestic policy, he tramples on progressives,'' said Anatoly
Bogudinov, 40.
   If the awards were presented for Gorbachev's humanitarian
actions, Bogudinov said, the sponsors forgot about the basics.
   ``The least we want is sausage, but he doesn't give it to us, and
you ask whether he deserves these awards!''
   During a ceremony at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Gorbachev
received the Albert Einstein Peace Prize, the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt Freedom Medal, the Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent
Peace Prize, the Man of History award from the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation and the Martin Luther King Jr. International Peace Award
from Friends World College.
   Bogudinov asked a question of his own: What would the American
people do if they had a president like Gorbachev?
   ``If Bush did everything on the international scene but nothing
for his own country, the people wouldn't support him,'' Bogudinov
said.
   Even criticizing the country's president, he noted, has been
outlawed. The Supreme Soviet legislature passed a bill last month
imposing a fine and jail sentence for insulting the Soviet president.
   Diagonally across Pushkin Square, at McDonald's, Soviets sinking
their teeth into America's classic family fare were generally more
positive about their leader and his policies.
   ``We're very glad our relations are improving,'' said Oksana, a
23-year-old housewife eating ice cream on the second floor of the
McDonald's, which opened in January.
   ``We're anxious for improvements in trade and anticipate that
friendship with America will bring improvements in our lives,'' said
the woman, who refused to give her last name.
   President Bush and Gorbachev Friday approved the outlines of a

   Another customer in the crowded restaurant said the simple fact
he was talking to an American reporter was a sign that glasnost was

<HEAD>NASA Prepares for Test To Find Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA on Saturday prepared for another
test of Columbia in its effort to pinpoint the hydrogen leak that
has grounded the space shuttle until mid-June or possibly July.
   Workers have been trying without success to locate the leak in
Columbia's rear engine compartment since Thursday by increasing
pressure on the shuttle's external tank, which is filled with helium.
   On Wednesday, the tank will be partly filled with liquid
hydrogen, duplicating conditions when the leak was detected six
hours before last Wednesday's launch. More than a half-million
gallons of volatile liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being
pumped into Columbia at the time.
   ``It doesn't appear that leak is going to remanifest itself until
they get that supercold hydrogen flowing through the system again,''
NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said Saturday. ``What probably has
happened, the leak has sealed itself at room temperature, which is
what we're working at now.''
   Engineers believe the leak is in or near a 17-inch valve in a
pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the
shuttle's main engines.
   Over the weekend, NASA planned to circulate helium through the
shuttle's fuel system in preparation for the tanking test, then
disconnect explosive devices that were attached to the orbiter for
launch.
   Officials for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said it's doubtful the tanking test will pinpoint a cause that can
be fixed easily at the launch pad. Returning Columbia to its hangar
for repairs would push the astronomy mission into July, they said.
   Columbia holds in its payload bay a $150 million observatory
called Astro that will examine ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted
from extremely hot stars, galaxies and other objects.

<HEAD>Family Has 4,000 Sets of Salt and Pepper Shakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sherman and Georgia Cutshaw are known
as a spicy couple.
   After 16 years of marriage, the Cutshaws have amassed 4,000 sets
of salt and pepper shakers. They line shelves in the kitchen, living
room _ and their bedroom.
   ``It started just real innocent,'' Cutshaw says. ``I'd pick up a
set or two of them at a yard sale or a flea market or something like
that, just a little something to bring home so I wouldn't have to
show up empty-handed.''
   No typical couple, Cutshaw is 77 and his wife is 35. They have a
14-year-old son. And as their fascination with matching spice
containers became known, relatives and friends added to the
collection.
   ``Every time some of them would go on vacation or just out of
town, they would bring us salt and pepper shakers,'' she said. ``It
got to be a little fun thing for them to do too.''
   Boasting exotic shakers from Cuba, Bermuda and Hawaii, the
Cutshaws say their most unusual set depicts Adam and Eve.
   ``Adam's got a branch on,'' Mrs. Cutshaw said. ``Eve's got the
lower part sort of covered up, but the upper part's not. You know,
they look like Adam and Eve ought to look.''
   Cutshaw says he's always on the lookout for new sets, but
avoiding repitition can be tough.
   ``I can hardly ever find (any) now that I don't have,'' he said.
   The colorful variety of salt and pepper sets dominates the
couple's home, but Cutshaw says the couple uses plain glass shakers
when they sit down to eat.
   Keeping 8,000 knickknacks clean could drive some homemakers
crazy, but not Mrs. Cutshaw.
   ``I just clean them one at a time, never getting in a hurry,''
she said.

<HEAD>Medical Boards May Be Too Easy on Physicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing referrals of malpractice cases and
limited resources to investigate them may be prompting state medical
boards to show too much leniency in disciplining physicians, a draft
government report says.
   Although the disciplinary boards have grown in strength in recent
years, the report by Department of Health and Human Services'
inspector general said most of the cases brought to them are settled
through consent agreements.
   ``As the proportion of cases so settled exceeds 50 percent, and
indeed nears 100 percent in some places, one wonders if ... the
pressure to settle might not be leading some boards in some cases to
act more leniently than the violation would warrant,'' the report
said.
   The report, to be released this week, said the state boards are
getting more complaints and case referrals due to laws requiring
hospitals, insurance companies and others to report actions they
take against physicians.
   ``Case backlogs remain a serious problem, ... significant staff
shortages continue to impede the boards' disciplinary efforts,'' HHS
Inspector General Richard Kusserow wrote in the draft report, a copy
of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
   After reading the report, Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., concluded that
the different state medical boards still ``don't have the tools to
properly address these issues.''
   ``This country is playing catch-up ball in terms of dealing with
the quality issues,'' said Wyden, the chief author of a law
establishing a national databank for compiling actions taken against
physicians. The databank is expected to go into operation this fall.
   Since the law was passed in 1986, most states have implemented or
strengthened statutes requiring mandatory reporting of actions taken
against physicians, Kusserow's report said.
   Most states now require hospitals to report their actions against
physicians and 33 states require insurance companies to report
medical malpractice cases.
   But federally supported peer organizations that review Medicare
claims account for only a small number of cases referred to state
boards, even though they could be a major source of leads about
doctors who should be disciplined, the report said.
   In the few instances where these peer groups do refer cases,
state boards don't consider them useful sources of information
because the review groups have limited authority to release case
details, the report said.
   Although officials don't know how many complaints are referred to
state medical boards each year, signs that the number is increasing
are ``widespread,'' according to the report.
   The Federation of State Medical Boards reported the number of
actions state boards took against physicians rose 29 percent from
2,019 in 1985 to 2,597 in 1987, the latest year for which figures
were available.
   However, the inspector general estimated that only about
three-quarters of those were initial disciplinary actions against
physicians. The figures do not represent the number of physicians
disciplined, since action by three states against one physician
would be reported as three actions.
   Currently, there is no way to measure how many physicians warrant
disciplinary action for delivering improper or substandard care, the
report said.
   ``But some recent studies suggest quite strongly that ... the
universe of potential actionable events far exceeds the number of
disciplinary actions actually imposed by the boards,'' the report
said.
   The report also found that states vary widely in the number of
actions taken by their medical boards. From 1985 to 1987, statewide
rates of board actions taken ranged from 2.6 per 1,000 physicians to
32.2. The median was 14.3 per 1,000 physicians.
   The report recommended that states use all revenues from medical
licensing fees exclusively to support their medical boards. It also
listed changing Medicaid and Medicare regulations as among the steps
federal health agencies could take to help coordinate and foster
cooperative investigative efforts among states.

   A bomb in a plastic bag exploded in
a crowded square Saturday barely a week before national elections,
injuring about 15 people including tourists enjoying a concert,
witnesses and news reports said.
   One witness said scores were injured, but that could not be
independently confirmed.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility and police refused
to provide details, saying it was too early to establish a motive.
   With emotions running high ahead of parliamentary elections next
Friday and Saturday, some people on the scene blamed the explosion
on attempts to disrupt the democratic process that toppled hard-line
Communists last fall.
   The government's CTK news agency reported ``a bomb placed by an
unknown person in a plastic bag exploded on Old Town Square, causing
light injuries to between 10 and 15 people.''
   The brief dispatch said the explosion occurred at 4:16 p.m.
   Old Town Square is one of Prague's best-known historical
rendezvous points for tourists as well as a site of frequent rallies
and weekend concerts.
   Witnesses who examined the explosive device said what appeared to
be a pipe bomb was placed close to a statue in the middle of the
square with a detonation mechanism that included batteries hooked up
by wires.
   It was not clear whether the bomb had a timing device or whether
it was activated by a person on the scene.
   ``While a music band was playing, the bomb exploded, injuring
scores of people, including foreign tourists, children and women
present,'' said Richard Nygryn of Prague.
   ``I saw cut lead, glass balls on the scene as the cops were
investigating it,'' Nygryn, 36, told a reporter. ``A shop widow
nearby had a large hole in it as if shot through with a cannon.''
   ``A man injured by the explosion told me he was just walking by
when it happened and before he knew anything, he was lying on the
ground with his face covered in blood,'' said.
   People at the scene shortly after the blast ``were blaming
everybody from the interior minister to the STB for this,'' Nygryn
said.
   Interior Minister Richard Sacher, a Christian Democrat, has been
accused by opponents of shielding former agents of the STB _ the
secret police of the former Communist regime led by Milos Jakes.
   The parliamentary elections on Friday and Saturday will be the
freest balloting in Czechoslovakia four decades. The country's
interim coalition government includes non-Communist President Vaclav
Havel.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eggs plundered from the nests of endangered
brown pelicans and laughing sea gulls were swiped by fishermen who
planned to eat them, federal wildlife authorities said.
   Acting on a tip, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents boarded
the 65-foot trawler Gypsy Wind on Thursday and seized nearly 200
eggs allegedly stolen from a bird sanctuary near the mouth of the
Mississippi River.
   The thieves nearly wiped out the hatchling population on the Mud
Lumps barrier island by looting 26 of the 27 pelican nests and an
unknown number of laughing sea gull nests, wildlife service
spokesman James Bartee said Friday.
   Eighty brown pelican eggs and 118 gull eggs were recovered. The
laughing sea gull is protected under federal laws. The brown pelican
is listed as endangered, Bartee said.
   The five fishermen accused of stealing the eggs apparently
intended to eat them, he said.
   ``This stuff has been going on for years,'' Bartee said. ``But
we've never been able to catch anyone doing it _ we always get there
too late.''
   He did not release the names of the fishermen, but said the
trawler was seized.
   The fishermen could be charged under the Endangered Species Act,
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacey Act, a law dealing with
transportation of illegal wildlife, he said.
   The eggs are probably a total loss, ``but if there's any hope at
all, we'll airlift them to Audubon Zoo'' in New Orleans, Bartee said.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of communist supporters
rallied in the East German capital Saturday to protest the
government's decision to take control of the ousted party's vast
holdings.
   In the sort of demonstration that was sometimes harshly dealt
with by the former Stalinist government, protesters rallied in a
park to denounce what they called the ``fascist'' action of the
democratic leadership.
   ``First, PDS banned. Second, books burned. Third, Auschwitz?''
read a banner at the rally, seeking to compare the government to
Hitler's Nazi regime.
   PDS stands for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
reconstituted Communist Party that lost power last year after
demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people.
   The government news agency ADN estimated the crowd at about
65,000 people.
   The protesters were angry about the decision by Parliament on
Thursday to put the vast holdings of the defunct Communist party in
trust pending an investigation by an independent commission of their
value and ownership.
   The former Communists amassed perhaps billions of dollars in
houses, businesses and property during their four decades in power.
   Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, leader of the former Communist faction that
holds 66 seats in the 400-member Parliament, has accused the
government of seeking to eliminate his party by seizing its assets.
   Although the party finished a distant third in East Germany's
first democratic elections on March 18, it enjoys its strongest
support in the capital, where many people owe their careers to loyal
party membership.
   The step by Parliament was part of the process of moving East
Germany to a system of private ownership. East Germany is to combine
its economy with West Germany's by July 2, a prelude to full
unification expected next year.
   The action also was aimed at preventing former Communists from
benefiting financially from German unification by disposing of their
assets in a free market economy.
   The law passed by Parliament will allow Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere to form a commission in coming days that will have broad
powers to search houses, interrogate witnesses and seize evidence.
   East Germany's economic minister, meanwhile, said in a newspaper
interview Saturday that the nation will experience massive unrest
during the difficult early stages of moving to a free market.
   ``I predict a hot autumn in the GDR,'' Gerhard Pohl was quoted as
saying in the West Berlin newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
   Many state-supported enterprises are certain to close when forced
to compete with more efficient Western companies, and others will
have to lay off workers to survive.
   Anywhere from 500,000 to 4 million people will lose their jobs in
the first two years of unification, according to estimates. The
country has about 10 million workers.
   ``Unrest among the populace cannot be avoided,'' Pohl said.
   East Germany is wrestling with how to dispose of the so-called
``people's-owned enterprises,'' of the old communist regime.
   Pohl said 168 such enterprises have been converted to some sort
of joint private ownership, 200 are being considered for similiar
status and 8,000 are still state-owned. He said all should be moved
to the private sector by late October.

   All charges against three followers of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche accused of bilking an elderly woman out of
$72,000 were dropped because of concern for the alleged victim's
health, a prosecutor said.
   Patricia Noble-Schenk, Ron Fredman and Richard Blomquist, all of
Chicago, had each faced charges of robbery, intimidation, theft by
threat and three counts of residential burglary. Their second trial
was to begin Monday in this northwestern Illinois town.
   ``The case is dismissed and now closed,'' Ogle County State's
Attorney Dennis R. Schumacher said Friday.
   The three had been accused of bilking 89-year-old Harriet Driver
out of $72,000. But during the first trial in March, Mrs. Driver
became ill on the witness stand. She was hospitalized for a week,
and a mistrial was declared.
   The three were employees of a Chicago-based company linked to
LaRouche which solicited donations and distributed literature for
the extremist.
   Prosecutors had said the three pressured Mrs. Driver to donate
money, but the defense had argued Mrs. Driver gave the contributions
willingly.
   ``We worked out our concerns with Mrs. Driver, her family and her
doctors,'' Schumacher said Friday. ``We've decided that there is
nothing further in the best interests of Mrs. Driver that we can
do.''
   LaRouche, who was convicted of federal charges of conspiracy and
mail fraud, is serving a 15-year prison term in the federal medical
prison in Rochester, Minn.

   Tracey A. Stewart will be missed when she
graduates from high school Sunday. After all, teachers and students
in Raleigh County have seen her in class every day for the past 13
years.
   ``Some times when I think about it, I think I must have been
crazy,'' said Ms. Stewart, a senior at Liberty Raleigh High School.
``I can't believe I did all this for a certificate.''
   Ms. Stewart said she has no secret formula for perfect attendance.
   ``I don't think it's a big deal,'' she said. ``My parents go to
work, so I would rather go to school than be at home by myself.''
But she also said she'd probably not keep up the perfect record if
she had it to do over again.
   Ann Stewart, Tracey's mother, said she remembers plenty of times
when her daughter dragged herself from a sickbed to attend classes.
   ``There were times when I tried to get her to stay home from
school, but she wouldn't do it,'' Mrs. Stewart said.
   Ms. Stewart said the closest she came to staying home was during
her sophomore year, when she was depressed about her brother and his
friends having graduated the year before.
   ``But I got over it,'' she said.
   Ms. Stewart had a lot of incentives besides classwork to make her
get out of bed every day. She participated in basketball, volleyball
and several clubs and held a job.
   Now, she's ready to move on to Beckley College and, eventually,
West Virginia University.
   ``I'm just like every senior. I'm just ready to graduate,'' said
Ms. Stewart.

   A group that monitors the Helsinki Accords on
Saturday began two days of hearings on past Soviet human rights
abuses in a test of whether the Kremlin would tolerate public
discussion of its record.
   The hearings coincide with the superpower summit in Washington,
where human rights issues were on the agenda of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Bush.
   Officials of the International Helsinki Federation for Human
Rights said they decided to hold their annual meeting in Moscow to
gauge the city's suitability for hosting the 1991 Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   ``We wanted to see if it is possible to hold a private meeting in
the Soviet Union without an official invitation or an official
sponsor,'' said Jeri Laber, the group's director.
   So far, she said, there have been a few problems, especially with
visas for Soviets living abroad, including former political prisoner
Yuri Orlov.
   ``The problems have been solved, but not without lots of fights
and discussions,'' she said.
   Gerald Nagler, a conference organizer, said many delegates,
particularly those from Eastern Europe, had to wait until the last
minute before receiving Soviet visas.
   Laber and Nagler said that since arriving in Moscow, the
delegates had not been harassed or mistreated by authorities.
   The Helsinki Federation was founded in 1982 and is the umbrella
group for the 17 national Helsinki Watch committees. It monitors
compliance with the final provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Accords,
which covered European security issues, economic cooperation and
human rights.
   Moscow has been accepted as the site for the federation's 1991
meeting. But organizers said it was important to find out early
whether it was possible to hold a meeting in the Soviet capital
without political or bureaucratic interference.
   Before its public session Saturday, the group heard private
reports from delegates, including Rosalynn Carter, wife of former
U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and Yelena Bonner, the widow of
activist Andrei Sakharov.
   The group later took testimony from Soviets about political
prisoners, psychiatric abuse, prison conditions, legal changes and
freedom of the press under the reforms initiated by Gorbachev.
   Findings will be presented at a meeting in Copenhagen June 6-7.

<TEXT>
   Irish Republican Army member Joe Doherty isn't
leaving prison, but he's getting a new address _ one his supporters
hope will refocus attention on his case as he starts his eighth year
in a federal jail.
   The City Council this week is prepared to rename the street
corner below his cell Joe Doherty Corner. The plan to honor Doherty,
the convicted killer of a British army sergeant in 1980, has angered
British officials who condemn him as a terrorist and a murderer.
   Supporters of the name change, which is to remain in effect until
Doherty is released, hope it will help free him.
   ``It is an abomination that Doherty should be held in a prison in
our city as long as he has been,'' said Carolyn Maloney, the city
councilwoman who proposed the change.
   A City Council committee and a local community board already have
approved the proposal. The full council is expected to pass the
measure at its Tuesday session.
   Supporters hope to hold the official ceremony renaming the corner
on June 18 _ the beginning of Doherty's eighth year at the jail.
   ``He's lived here as long, maybe longer, than most of the people
in this neighborhood,'' said Paul Goldstein, district manager of the
community board that approved the name change.
   Indeed, he has been in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
longer than any other inmate in its history, longer than most of its
guards. His seventh-floor cell and an orange prison jumpsuit are the
fixtures in his life.
   Doherty was unaware of the move to rename the intersection until
last week, when his lawyer, Mary Pike, told him about it.
   ``He was visibly delighted. ... He's touched and delighted that
the people of the city have seen fit to address the injustice of his
situation,'' Pike said.
   The 35-year-old prisoner has been the focus of a legal battle
since his arrest at a Manhattan bar in 1983.
   Three years earlier, Doherty was convicted of murder in the
machine-gun slaying of a British army captain during an IRA ambush
in Northern Ireland. Doherty escaped from a Belfast prison before
his conviction, used a false passport to enter the United States and
avoided capture for two years.
   The British want him returned to finish his prison term. The
Reagan and Bush administrations have supported their request but
deportation has been blocked in the courts.
   Supporters say Doherty is a freedom fighter entitled to political
asylum. And the list of those supporters is impressive: Mayor David
Dinkins, Cardinal John J. O'Connor and more than 100 members of
Congress have called for his release.
   The almost exclusively Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push the
British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it with
the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.
   Doherty has never been charged with a crime in the United States;
he's been held without bail that entire time. His lawyers were back
in court on Friday arguing for his release pending resolution of his
status.
   Courts have ruled that he was entitled to a hearing on whether he
should be given political asylum, but U.S. Attorneys General Edwin
Meese and Dick Thornburgh have refused to grant him such a hearing.
The whole matter is still being weighed in federal court in
Manhattan.
   North of the prison in midtown Manhattan is the British
Consulate, where reaction to the honor for Doherty was a mixture of
surprise and disgust.
   ``He's a murderer. ... The vast majority of the people in
Northern Ireland will feel somewhat bewildered and puzzled by the
decision to name a street after him,'' said Brian Kirk, information
director.
   It's not the first time city officials used a street sign to send
a political message.
   Last year, the corner of 42nd Street and 12th Avenue _ the site
of the Chinese Consulate _ was renamed Tiananmen Square. A section
of First Avenue opposite the United Nations was christened Raoul
Wallenberg Walk in 1985 after the Swedish diplomat who died or
disappeared in Soviet custody after World War II.
   The victory by Doherty supporters does not mean he will be able
to see a street sign through the jail's tiny windows.
   ``The irony is though the sign will be literally right outside,
Joe will not see it,'' said Pike.

   President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
in a final full day of summitry, moved Saturday from the splendor of
the White House to this rustic mountaintop hideaway to review
regional disputes and make a last-minute stab at narrowing
differences over Europe's future.
   ``I'm at the president's disposal,'' the Soviet leader said after
a 30-minute helicopter ride with Bush from the South Lawn.
   Gorbachev said their talks, in the relaxed atmosphere of the
143-acre presidential compound, would give them a better
understanding of each other.
   Bush, questioned by reporters, declined to discuss the day's
agenda, but said, ``We have lovely trails here we can walk on. It's
a totally relaxed environment.''
   The heavily wooded camp, 65 miles northwest of Washington in the
Catoctin Mountains, has been the site of momentous meetings by world
leaders.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met at the
presidential retreat to plan the Normandy invasion. Dwight
Eisenhower and Nikita Khrushchev forged the ``spirit of Camp
David.'' Jimmy Carter brought the leaders of Israel and Egypt
together there in search of Middle East peace.
   Bush and Gorbachev met at Aspen Lodge, a rustic building with a
large living room and a picture window view of the mountainside. At
lunch, they dined on sorrel soup, crabmeat salad and blueberry and
nectarine sorbet.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, arriving at Camp David before the leaders,
expressed confidence about reaching a treaty before year's end to
cut troops and tanks in Europe _ even though the summit has failed
to make apparent progress on that front.
   ``We're very hopeful,'' Baker told reporters.
   Shevardnadze said, ``We are also quite ready for that. I have my
pen ready.'' He took a pen from his pocket and waved it over his
head.
   After two days of meetings, major differences still divided Bush
and Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader, concerned about the military strength of a
united Germany, has opposed Bush's demand that the new nation be a
full member of NATO, including its military command.
   Despite U.S. concerns, Gorbachev also has showed no sign of
easing coercion of Lithuania, which is struggling for independence
from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev told reporters that the main subject at Camp David was
regional disputes _ which includes Afghanistan, the Middle East,
Cuba, Central America and southern Africa.
   ``The most important thing today we're going to discuss is go
over the planet and its flash points and discuss regional issues,''
the Soviet president said. ``And of course, we will pursue our
general discussions in order to understand each other better.''
   Bush and Gorbachev are to wrap up their summit with a mid-morning
news conference Sunday at the White House.
   Afterward, the Soviet leader heads for talks with businessmen in
Minneapolis and a rendezvous in San Francisco with former President
Reagan and a meeting with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on
normalizing relations.
   The major business of the summit was concluded late Friday with
agreement of a long-awaited deal to slash long-range nuclear
missiles, an accord to halt production of chemical weapons and a
trade pact that Gorbachev said was politically important for him at
home. They also signed a five-year deal to expand U.S. grain sales
to the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has described the Camp David meeting as the most
important session of the summit, saying it will determine whether
their achievements were ``just important or very important.''
   Gorbachev is the third Soviet leader to visit. Following the
Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks, Leonid Brezhnev met there with Richard
Nixon.
   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev flew ahead of their husbands to
Camp David and were on hand to greet them amid a formal naval
welcoming ceremony.
   Because Camp David is run by the Navy, Bush and Gorbachev were
``piped'' aboard as if boarding a ship. A ship's bell heralded their
arrival.
   Then, they boarded golf carts and rode away for their meetings.
   Mrs. Bush took the wheel of her cart, with Mrs. Gorbachev as her
passenger.
   The president asked Gorbachev, ``Do you want to drive?''
Gorbachev deferred to his host.
   ``Forward, march,'' Bush said, with a hand signal. ``Here we go.
A great day.''
   Meanwhile at the State Department, U.S. and Soviet officials
signed agreements establishing cultural and informational centers in
Washington and Moscow and a pact aimed at doubling circulation of
government magazines, ``America Illustrated'' and ``Soviet Life,''
distributed in the respective countries.
   They also signed a customs cooperation agreement in which U.S.
officials would provide special training to Soviet customs agents in
to stop smuggling of illegal drugs.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Nuclear Trigger Resumption Hinge on ``Criticality''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Energy Department prepares to resume
making nuclear warhead triggers at the Rocky Flats weapons plant,
concern remains about 62 pounds of plutonium in the plant's air
ducts.
   At issue: Whether enough plutonium has accumulated to lead to
``criticality'' _ the point at which a nuclear reaction become
self-sustaining.
   Phil Warner, general manager at Rocky Flats for plant operator
EG&amp;G Inc., said the plutonium in the air ducts poses no threat, but
state officials and environmentalists want the plutonium removed
from the air ducts before plutonium processing resumes at the plant.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins suspended plutonium operations at
Rocky Flats in November and said they only resume when safety
problems are solved. Rocky Flats, 16 miles northwest of Denver, has
been operating since 1953.
   The plutonium, discovered in the air ducts earlier this year, got
into them over many years because filters that were supposed to
catch the plutonium sometimes failed to work and sometimes were
removed after becoming clogged, officials said.
   EG&amp;G scientists have said that, in a worst-case scenario, the
plutonium in the air ducts ``could release neutrons that could
injure or kill within 10 feet,'' Warner said.
   ``To my knowledge, there's never been a criticality accident that
involved a nuclear explosion,'' said Robert W. Terry, senior health
physicist for the Colorado Department of Health.
   ``The hazard is to the plant workers in the immediate vicinity of
the accident,'' he said. ``It's not the type of accident likely to
create a widespread environmental hazard to the off-site
population.''
   Witnesses to nuclear criticality elsewhere say that when the
nuclear reactions occurred, they saw a blue flash followed by
ovenlike heat.
   Workers within the deadly 10-to-15 foot radius are bombarded with
neutrons and gamma radiation. Their skin reddens and severe nausea
sets in quickly. In extreme cases, the victim becomes comatose
within 20 minutes and death follows in a few hours or days.
   The plutonium accumulation is the latest in a nearly chain of
problems that began in June 1989 when the FBI and Environmental
Protection Agency raided Rocky Flats, looking for evidence of
illegal disposal of hazardous wastes.
   A federal grand jury is examining evidence gathered during that
raid but has not issued indictments.
   Late last year, the Energy Department replaced Rockwell
International as the plant operator with EG&amp;G as the controversy
over hazardous waste disposal at the plant heated up. EG&amp;G took over
Jan. 1.
   EG&amp;G has completed its external radiation measurements of the air
ducts, said Doug Croucher, director of nuclear safety for EG&amp;G-Rocky
Flats.
   Samples from two of the ducts have been sent to the government's
Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico to determine what form the
plutonium is in, and if there are other hazardous substances present.
   ``When we've taken the samples (from all of the ducts) and know
what's in there, then we'll end up with our plan on what we'll do,''
Warner said.
   ``We'll never get rid of all of it, but I think we'll find a way
to deal with'' the air duct plutonium, said Victor Stello Jr., the
Energy Department's deputy assistant secretary for facilities.
   Stello said if the plutonium is in an easily removable form, such
as dust, it may be vacuumed out, he said. In other cases, the entire
duct could be removed and replaced.
   Gov. Roy Romer, other elected officials and environmentalists are
concerned the plant will be restarted too soon.
   Energy Department inspections planned in late June and July could
lead to resumption of production by fall.
   Romer wants the air duct problem resolved before production is
resumed, and he has asked Colorado's congressional delegation to
hold hearings on whether the suspension of production at Rocky Flats
has jeopardized the nation's security.
   ``His concern is if they are pushing too hard (to restart
production at Rocky Flats) there might be a chance that corners will
be cut. And we don't want that to happen,'' said John Haggard, Rocky
Flats program manager for the Colorado Department of Health.
   But Melinda Kassen of Boulder, lawyer for the Environmental
Defense Fund, maintains that the federal government``really hasn't
made a case they have to restart at Rocky Flats for the purpose of
national security.''
   ``So, if it isn't absolutely necessary that they restart for
national security, then why don't they use this opportunity to get
into compliance with health and safety laws ... while they're shut
down,'' she said.
   Critics also fear what would happen if fire would hit in those
plutonium-contaminated ducts as it did in the plant's plating
laboratory two weeks ago. The blaze caused more than $100,000 in
damage, but no one was injured.

   The United States and Soviet Union signed
agreements Saturday to establish cultural centers in each other's
capitals, increase circulation of two magazines and cooperate on
customs enforcement.
   Under the customs agreement, the two sides will share information
and the United States will train Soviet border agents in techniques
to catch drug smugglers, said Carol Hallett, commissioner of the
U.S. Customs Service.
   ``We're going to provide training and share our experience ... to
assist them in preventing some of these problems from getting to the
point they have for us,'' she said.
   Hallett also said the agreement could help stop the transfer of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to unstable Third World
countries.
   The three agreements, signed in a ceremony at the State
Department, were negotiated earlier in the year and fill out a
package of arms and trade accords announced by President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday evening.
   Under the cultural agreement, each country will open a ``cultural
and informational center'' in the other's capital, providing
libraries, seminars, film showings, language instruction and student
counseling.
   Bruce S. Gelb, director of the U.S. Information Agency, said the
United States soon will begin looking for a building to house the
cultural center in Moscow. He said the center should be in operation
within two years.
   Under the magazine agreement, the circulations of ``America
Illustrated,'' a Russian-language magazine published by the USIA,
and ``Soviet Life,'' the Soviet government's English-language
magazine, are to double to 250,000 copies a month in 1991.
   After 1991, the circulation of the two magazines is to be
governed by demand and availability of funds.

   A Japanese hotel chain took over the posh
Portman Hotel and changed its name after buying it for a reported
$103 million.
   Tokyu Corp., a Tokyo-based conglomerate that owns 75 other hotels
through various subsidiaries, on Friday formally took over the
331-room hotel a block from Union Square.
   New owners and managers greeted employees at the hotel's back
door, and handed doormen pillbox hats bearing the hotel's new name,
Pan Pacific.
   The Japanese conglomerate paid $103 million for the Portman and a
96-year lease for the land it occupies, according to reports in
Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle.
   The hotel is the kind of ``trophy'' property that Japanese
investors like to buy to establish an immediate presence in the
American market, said Jay Scott, a consultant for Laventhol &amp;
Horwath.
   The 3-year-old hotel, which built its reputation by offering such
upscale amenities as Rolls-Royce limousine service, has turned in
disappointing results in recent years, analysts said. The previous
owner was Atlanta-based Portman Properties, headed by
architect-developer John Portman.
   The new owners plan an advertising blitz aimed at Southern
California and New York, said Robert Wilhelm, managing director of
the Pan Pacific Hotel.
   ``Our advertising budget for this year will be about $650,000,
about double what it was under the Portman,'' Wilhelm said.

   Sir Rex Harrison, the English actor whose charm
graced plays and films for half a century and made him the
quintessential Henry Higgins in the musical ``My Fair Lady,'' died
today at age 82.
   Attorney Harold Schiff said the actor died of pancreatic cancer
in his sleep about 4:45 a.m. at his Manhattan residence.
   Knighted only last summer and still at work on Broadway three
weeks before his death, Harrison was hailed as one of the most
gifted comedians of his time. ``He's the best light comedy actor in
the world,'' Noel Coward once said, ``next to me.''
   Harrison created the role of Henry Higgins in the Broadway
premiere of ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956, invented a style of
half-talking, half-singing called ``soft singing'' and won a Tony
award as best actor. He won an Academy Award for the same role in
the 1964 film version, which also won the Oscar as best picture, and
revived the role on the stage in 1981.
   He had appeared in his last play, ``The Circle,'' a revival of a
1920s comedy by W. Somerset Maugham, on Broadway until last month.
He missed the last nine days of the run because of illness, said
Jeffrey Richards, a spokesman for the play's producers.
   Elliot Martin, who produced ``the Circle'' and three other shows
Harrison starred in, said he had noticed the actor was losing weight
and did not look well in the final weeks that he performed.
   ``He said, `Well, these gallstones are acting up and I'll be all
right after I have a bit of a rest,''' Martin recalled.
   ``He died with his boots on, no question about it,'' he said.
   Schiff said Harrison wasn't told about his cancer and ``didn't
want to know. I saw him on Friday. He was OK. He was just fading
away. Fortunately, there was no pain at all.''
   When he was knighted last summer, Harrison said he had no
intention of retiring, because ``I wouldn't know what to do.''
   ``I think they rather like to leave awarding honors until you get
to a certain age,' he said. ``It was a marvelous moment kneeling
there and getting tapped on each shoulder.''
   Among his films were ``Doctor Dolittle,'' 1967, and ``The Yellow
Rolls-Royce,'' 1964.
   But his most famous film appearance was his reprise of his stage
role as the stuffy language professor Higgins in ``My Fair Lady,''
who falls in love with a Cockney waif after teaching her how to
speak proper English.
   The Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe musical, known for such songs
as ``The Rain in Spain'' and ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' was
based on the George Bernard Shaw play ``Pygmalion.''
   Married six times, Harrison said he brought much of himself to
playing Higgins, who at first is cold and imperious with Eliza
Doolittle.
   ``I wouldn't call it a hardness exactly, but in the piece I was
trying to train this girl Eliza and she irritated the hell out of
me,'' Harrison said in a 1989 interview with a London newspaper.
   ``Women can irritate the hell out of me. I don't tell women what
to expect out of me. They learn to adjust, I suppose. Either that or
they walk away, which has happened throughout my life.''
   ``He was like all very great stars. He was temperamental, he was
excitable and he was very funny,'' his agent, Lawrence Evans, said
in London.
   ``He had the best sense of humor of almost any actor I have ever
known,'' said Evans, who worked with the actor for more than 40
years. ``He was a lovable, irascible man.''
   The actor last appeared on the London stage in ``The Admirable
Crichton'' in 1988.
   ``He has now become a gently feathery presence who potters
benignly about with little of the tenor bark that was once his
trademark,'' wrote a critic for the Guardian newspaper.
   Harrison was born Reginald Carey Harrison in Huyton, near
Liverpool, on March 5, 1908. He joined the Liverpool Repertory
Theatre in 1924.
   His first appearance on the London stage was in 1930 and by the
end of the decade he emerged as a star, having played in Rattigan's
``French Without Tears'' from 1936 to 1938.
   The first of his six marriages was in 1934 to Collette Thomas, a
French teacher.
   Marriage number two was to actress Lili Palmer in 1943, and she
accompanied him as he began his American career.
   Asked what sort of a husband he was, Miss Palmer once said: ``He
was a man's man, an Englishman. Let's face it, Englishmen don't like
women.''
   After that marriage was dissolved in 1957, Harrison married
actress Kay Kendall, who died of leukemia in 1959.
   Playwright Sir Terence Rattigan said of those times: ``I realized
Rex's great courage. He made the last two years of Kay's life the
best years.''
   Years later, Harrison starred in Rattigan's ``In Praise of
Love,'' the story of a man whose wife is dying of an incurable
disease and is forbidden by doctors from telling her.
   Harrison married English actress Rachel Roberts in 1962. They
were divorced in 1976. He then married Elizabeth Harris and later
married Mercia Tinkler.
   Harrison is survived by his wife; two sons by previous marriages,
Noel and Carey; a sister; and grandchildren.
   The funeral service will be private but there will be a memorial
June 18 in Manhattan. Schiff said Harrison had requested his
memorial be called a celebration and that there be jazz.

   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev visits the Brand family
farm in Minnesota on Sunday, the Soviet leader will see a
picture-perfect 240-acre operation profitably run by four people _
an utterly alien concept at home.
   By contrast, the Dzerzhinsky Collective Farm on the outskirts of
Moscow has 140 acres and a staff of 1,300.
   As a vegetable farm with greenhouses for winter crops, the
Dzerzhinsky operation could be expected to have a few more workers
than the Brands, who raise alfalfa, corn, soybeans and 75 dairy cows
on their spread in Farmington.
   But the Soviet farm also has its own stores in Moscow, its own
drivers and trucks to haul produce to the stores, its own
construction workers to build farm buildings and housing for the
staff.
   President Gorbachev's reforms allowed it to sell one-third of its
crop at market prices last year, so the farm spent the profits on
its own fully staffed hospital.
   Under the Communist system of bureaucratic distribution, it is
difficult to obtain nearly everything _ from building supplies to
the services of a skilled stonemason. There is no such thing as
renting a spare tractor or running down to the local feed store for
a few supplies.
   So state businesses have evolved into huge self-contained
communities, hoarding scarce resources like trucks and construction
workers so they will be available when needed.
   The result is massive inefficiency.
   Soviet farms employ more than eight times as many people as
American farms. And they produce far less food, even using the
production statistics that Soviets now admit are inflated.
   Many Soviet farms resort to old-fashioned barter to obtain needed
materials. Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, reported Saturday
that one collective farm traded 30 tons of meat and 50 tons of
potatoes to a Dnepopetrovsk factory for metal, wire fencing and
other products.
   Gorbachev himself has said 25 percent of his country's crops are
lost in harvest and storage.
   Soviet farming also has taken a toll on people.
   Working and living conditions in isolated villages drive some
residents to drink heavily, the government newspaper Izvestia
reported Saturday in an article about eight farmers from Tula who
died after downing a poison they thought contained alcohol.
   Gorbachev is bringing needed change to Soviet agriculture. He
promises a switch to a market system, albeit slowly. He pushed
through reforms to allow family farming on land leased from the
state for up to 50 years, and he has allowed more produce to be sold
directly to consumers.
   But he still won't allow a Soviet family to own their own farm.
That idea veers too closely to capitalism.
   Gorbachev tried to raise grain production and reduce imports last
year by promising to pay Soviet farmers in foreign currency for
exceeding planned production. Newspapers reported the program a
failure. Most farmers, disbelieving the offer, ignored it.
   Last month, Gorbachev doubled the price paid to farmers for their
grain, and bread prices are expected to triple on July 1 to help
cover that change.
   As Gorbachev said in Washington on Friday, he was naive to think
that minor tinkering with the Soviet system would fix the economy.
   ``There was no incentive. There was no motivation for people to
work,'' he said.
   But many Soviets question Gorbachev's intentions on agricultural
reform. There will be no radical change, reformers say, as long as
the key Communist Party post in charge of agriculture is held by
Yegor Ligachev, an ardent believer in collective farming.

   When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
climbed aboard Marine One for a 30-minute flight to Camp David on
Saturday, it may have been his first ride in a helicopter. In the
past, he has avoided them.
   Most foreign leaders who visit Washington and arrive by jet at
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland take a short helicopter
ride to the White House.
   But on his arrival last Wednesday for a four-day summit meeting
with President Bush, Gorbachev traveled into the city by motorcade
and made his formal appearance at the White House the following
morning.
   During his December 1987 summit with former President Reagan,
Gorbachev declined an offer to take a helicopter from Andrews to the
White House.
   All U.S. presidents since Dwight Eisenhower have made frequent
use of helicopters, both for speed and to avoid tying up Washington
street traffic with motorcades.
   But Gorbachev, who has flown in many jets, has never been known
to use a helicopter, either inside or outside the Soviet Union.
   A leading Soviet journalist, Novosti Press Agency head Albert I.
Vlasov, said he believed Saturday's flight was the Soviet leader's
first in a whirlybird.
   Soviet diplomats said they did not know whether Gorbachev has an
aversion to choppers, but one official said it would not be strange
if he did.
   ``So who does like helicopters?'' said the Soviet official, who
requested anonymity. ``They shake, they whirl around, they make
noise. A car is much better _ if you can take one.''
   As helicopters go, however, the presidential version _ a modified
military H-3 _ is relatively comfortable. It is VIP-equipped with a
dozen seats. Bush sits in a captain's type chair, facing another
one, which Gorbachev presumably used. There is a pull down table
that can be opened between them, or left up for more leg room.
   The rest of the seats are bench-style along the sides. To give
Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev the same comfortable seats their
husbands got, they flew to Camp David in a separate but identical
helicopter, departing from the South Lawn of the White House 10
minutes after the two heads of state.

<HEAD>Tough Issues Still Block Treaty _ And Star Wars Could Come Out Of
Closet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major issues _ and possibly that old
nemesis, Star Wars _ still block the way to a landmark treaty to cut
U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles.
   Despite optimistic summit statements by President Bush and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, indicating the treaty can be concluded this
year, roughly 30 issues remain unresolved.
   Ever since 1982, when President Ronald Reagan reversed his
skepticism of the arms control process and proposed deep cuts in
globe-girdling nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines, American
and Soviet negotiators have been grappling with a multitude of
thorny issues.
   One of the most difficult was the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative, known informally as Star Wars, the Reagan dream of
mounting a defense in space against Soviet ballistic missiles.
Moscow threatened to delay cutting offensive arms unless the United
States abandoned that program.
   Last year, the Soviets relented. But they did not swear never to
try again.
   And last week, as negotiators working at the State Department
burrowed into the toughest remaining offensive weapons issues, the
Soviets tried again to establish what the experts call ``linkage.``
   A senior U.S. official, describing the attempt, said Friday
night: ``We thought we had this problem straight, and then the
Soviets made proposals that unraveled it. And that sort of slowed us
up on the pace that we were on because we had to push them back onto
the ground that had been agreed _ which we managed to do.''
   The tactic that worked was deferring the issue to a second round
of negotiations to be held immediately after the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START) is signed.
   ``In the future talks the two sides will discuss strategic
stability issues of interest to them,'' a joint statement issued
Friday night said, ``including the the relationship between
strategic offensive and defensive arms...''
   That appears to mean the Star Wars genie is back in the bottle.
But it has a way of escaping.
   In the meantime, American and Soviet negotiators must confront
three tough issues when the bargaining resumes June 11 in Geneva.
They are:
   _The kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy,
ground-based SS-18 intercontinental missiles the Soviets will retain
under the treaty.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III proposed last month in
Moscow very limited testing, but the Soviets are demanding more
freedom to improve their deadliest nuclear weapon.
   _Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against numerical weapons limits established in
the treaty.
   The Soviets have offered to make a declaration that the bomber
would not be used on intercontinental missions. And they are willing
to restrict in-flight fueling, as the Soviets offered to do 13 years
ago.
   _The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies _ from the United States
to Britain, for instance.
   Surveying the road ahead of him, a senior U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, acknowledged: ``So we've got our work cut
out for us.'' But, he added: ``We can continue with the president's
commitment to finish a treaty this year. And we intend to do so.''
   Apart from the three tough issues, and a lot of unfinished work
on how inspectors will make sure the cuts are faithfully executed,
there are more than two-dozen other issues to be ironed out.
   Also, there is the vexing problem of the text itself.
   More than 400 pages have been compiled already in Geneva, but the
wordage will mount as negotiators come to closure on unsettled
issues. And then will come the lawyers, poring over the language for
loopholes.
   It is a serious task, as the debate in the Reagan years over the
meaning of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty showed.
   The treaty restricted anti-missile defenses as a means of
deterring a nuclear attack. The theory was a potential aggressor
would not risk devastating retaliation by launching a first strike.
   However, the advent of the Strategic Defense Initiative marked a
change in U.S. strategy. The Reagan administration, the Senate,
which had ratified the 1972 treaty, the Soviet Union and the arms
control community examined the text under a magnifying glass.
Proponents looked for evidence the program was legal, opponents for
proof it was not.
   The administration insisted the treaty did not prohibit the
development of an anti-missile system using nuclear weapons in
space. The Soviets and American critics, including all the former
U.S. negotiators except Paul H. Nitze, said Star Wars was in confict
with the treaty.
   The debate has subsided with Bush administration's muted
enthusiasm for Reagan's dream.
   But the seeds of disagreement are firmly planted.
   Initially, the treaty was advertised as massively cutting U.S.
and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons _ by 50 percent.
   That claim is not made any more. In the negotiations the two
sides have cut various deals to allow them to hold on to favorite
weapons through a variety of strategems.
   For instance, the United States can pack 20 air-launched cruise
missiles aboard a B52 bomber, but the warheads will be counted as 10
apiece on the first 150 bombers.
   Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the private Arms Control
Association, said Saturday that the treaty, as it stands now, would
result in a 30 percent reduction in U.S. ballistic warheads.
   The Soviets would have to destroy 50 percent of their warheads,
as well as 50 percent of their 308 SS-18 missiles and the
throw-weight _ or deliverable power _ of the missiles, Mendelsohn
said in an interview.
   But the treaty also will give the two sides enough leeway to
rejigger their strategic weapons arsenals in a way that will result
in an overall reduction of no more than 10 to 20 percent, he said.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Killings of Two More British Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army on Saturday claimed
responsibility for the shooting deaths of two British soldiers,
striking less than a week after it killed two tourists in the
Netherlands.
   Gunmen of the group fighting British rule in Northern Ireland
killed a British army major Saturday outside his home in Dortmund,
West Germany, and wounded a police officer when they got away during
a chase.
   In the central English town of Lichfield, police hunted for two
men who shot and killed a soldier and wounded two others waiting for
a train Friday afternoon.
   ``While British troops remain in Ireland such attacks will
continue,'' the IRA said in a statement distributed to news media in
Dublin, Ireland.
   On Sunday, IRA gunmen killed two London-based Australian lawyers
in the town square in Roermond, the Netherlands. The IRA later said
it had mistaken the men for soldiers.
   ``There is no argument or reason in this. It is simply that they
are out to kill,'' Defense Secretary Tom King said Saturday in an
interview with Press Association, the domestic news agency.
   ``They are out to cover the humiliation of their mistake in
killing two young Australians in Holland,'' he said.
   The attacks in the Netherlands, Germany and England continued an
IRA strategy of attacking ``soft'' targets associated with the
British army, such as off-duty soldiers or recruiting centers.
   The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic group, seeks to unite Ireland
under a socialist government. It is outlawed both in the
predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland,
a British province where paramilitary Protestant groups side with
London.
   Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for the West German federal prosecutor,
said Maj. Michael John Dillon-Lee was shot several times in the head
as he returned to his home in a British army housing area in
Dortmund just after midnight.
   ``He had parked his car and gotten out when one of two persons in
a Mazda car shot him,'' Hannich said, quoting a Dortmund police
report. His wife was in the car but was not hurt.
   The suspects' silver Mazda was spotted a short time later in
Dortmund and two police cars tried to stop it.
   ``Shots were fired from the Mazda at the police cars chasing it,
and one policeman was hit in the foot,'' Hannich said. The car was
later found abandoned in Hamm-Boenen, about 15 miles east of the
murder scene.
   It was the second IRA killing in less than a year in Dortmund,
home to about 10,000 British soldiers. On Sept. 7, an IRA unit
killed Heidi Hazell, 26, the German-born wife of a British soldier.
   About five hours before the West German attack, two men with
handguns shot the three soldiers at the Lichfield City rail station,
about 100 miles northwest of London, then fled across the tracks.
   The Ministry of Defense identified the dead man as 19-year-old
Pvt. William Robert Davies of Pontarddulais, South Wales. The
wounded men were Robert Parkin, 20, and Neil Evans, 19, the Ministry
of Defense said.
   The attacks followed a spate of reports last week that Peter
Brooke, the top British official in Northern Ireland, was making
progress toward arranging negotiations on a new political agreement
for the province.
   Brooke's delicate initiative is intended to open negotiations
between Protestant parties and the mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party. Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing _
which draws about a third of the Catholic vote in Northern Ireland _
is excluded from the negotiations.
   The IRA and other republican splinter groups fighting British
rule have caused more than half of the nearly 2,800 deaths in
Northern Ireland since the British army entered the province in 1969.
   In addition, the IRA has killed at least 14 people in Europe and
several dozen in England, including 21 in pub bombings in Birmingham
in 1974 and 11 Marine bandsmen in Deal, Kent, in September.
   Loyalist paramilitary groups associated with Protestants in
Northern Ireland are responsible for about one-fourth of the deaths,
while 12 percent are blamed on the police and army, according to a
study published last year by Irish journalist Michael McKeown.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Not Optimistic About Cambodia Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whose rebels are
fighting the country's Communist regime, arrived Saturday for peace
talks, but he said other guerrillas may not honor a proposed
cease-fire.
   ``There will be a dangerous situation after the signing,''
Sihanouk said in Beijing before boarding a plane for Tokyo. ``There
will be peace on paper but not on the ground.''
   The three days of talks toward ending the 11-year-old civil war
are mired in dispute even before their scheduled start Monday. The
Hun Sen government supported by Vietnam refuses to consider giving
an equal voice to Sihanouk's powerful Communist allies, the Khmer
Rouge.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to end three years of rule by
the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, whose repressive policies are blamed
for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.
   Sihanouk, who also represents two non-Communist guerrilla groups
supported by the United States, said in Beijing that he will sign
the cease-fire accord with Premier Hun Sen ``to show the good will
of the resistance and in order to show that I am in favor of a quick
return of peace in Cambodia.''
   But he said the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrilla
factions, have told him they are unhappy with the agreement crafted
by Thailand's defense minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
   The Khmer Rouge claim Vietnamese troops still occupy Cambodia
despite a massive pullout last year and that Vietnam has annexed
Cambodian territory.
   ``So there will be a possibility that in Tokyo the Khmer Rouge
will more or less sabotage the peace process,'' Sihanouk said.
   He also criticized Hun Sen for saying that Khmer Rouge leader
Khieu Samphan should not be allowed to sign the peace accord. By
ostracizing the Khmer Rouge leader, Sihanouk said, ``indirectly Hun
Sen encourages the Khmer Rouge to go on fighting.''
   Sihanouk said there will be no effective body to oversee the
cease-fire, and he called for reconvening the Paris Conference on
Cambodia, which ended in failure last year.
   Resistance forces led by the Khmer Rouge have launched major
attacks in recent days in a drive to expand areas under their
control before the June 4-6 Tokyo meeting.
   Guerrilla leaders and diplomats say the Khmer Rouge have made the
most substantial gains, but the pro-Hanoi government of Hun Sen also
has been active on the battlefields.
   Sihanouk, 67, was not available to reporters upon arriving in
Tokyo. He held a 55-minute meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
and thanked him for agreeing to a Thai suggestion to host the
conference, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Sihanouk
told Kaifu he had made a major compromise in recently proposing that
two sides _ his guerrilla coalition and the Hun Sen government _
make up a national council to prepare for elections.

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning actor Sir Rex Harrison, who taught
the king's English in ``My Fair Lady'' and talked to animals as the
lovable Dr. Dolittle during a 66-year career, died in his sleep
Saturday. He was 82.
   The actor, a stage and screen star in the United States and his
native England, died of pancreatic cancer at his Manhattan home,
said his attorney, Harold Schiff.
   ``To watch him and to work with him was a joyful experience,''
said Julie Andrews, who played Eliza Doolittle to Harrison's
professor Henry Higgins in ``My Fair Lady'' on Broadway for three
years.
   ``I doubt there was anyone before like him. ... The theater has
lost an extraordinary one-of-a-kind.''
   Harrison won a Tony award for his Broadway portrayal of Higgins
and earned a best-actor Academy Award for his screen version
opposite Audrey Hepburn.
   ``He was the essence of a great actor, a fabulous technician. ...
He had a wonderful sense of humor, fabulous diction,'' Miss Hepburn
said. ``He was the personification of a superb actor, the
quintessential actor.
   ``He was always thoughtful and helpful and fun, and I really
adored every minute I worked with him.''
   Harrison had been ill only a short time and did not know he had
cancer, Schiff said. Doctors told him he was suffering from gall
bladder trouble, the lawyer said.
   ``He just thought he was not well. He didn't want to know,''
Schiff said.
   Harrison, who debuted on Broadway in 1936, died three weeks after
his latest appearance there May 11. He played Lord Porteous in W.
Somerset Maugham's 1920s comedy ``The Circle,'' which is vying for
``best revival'' honors at Sunday night's Tony Awards ceremony.
   ``He died with his boots on, no question about it,'' said
``Circle'' producer Elliot Martin, referring to Harrison's decision
not to retire.
   ``He wanted to be on the stage. That was it. That was his life,''
Schiff said. ``He didn't care about ... retiring, he didn't care
about anything else but the theater.''
   Harrison was best known for his high-tone Higgins in ``My Fair
Lady.''
   ``Mr. Harrison is perfect in the part _ crisp, lean, complacent
and condescending until at last a real flare of human emotions burns
the egotism away,'' New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson wrote.
   The musical version of George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion'' opened
on Broadway in 1956, with the film coming out eight years later.
Harrison reprised his role in a 1981 Broadway revival that earned
him $50,000 a week.
   Harrison, who characterized his vocal range as ``one and a half
notes,'' half-spoke, half-crooned ``I've grown accustomed to her
face'' hundreds of times as the stuffy language professor who falls
in love with a Cockney waif after teaching her how to overcome her
lower-class accent and speak proper English.
   ``I could have played Higgins for 20 years, but I wanted to do
other things,'' Harrison said in 1985. ``And I did, in fact.''
   Among them was his role as Dr. Dolittle, the fanciful jungle
gentleman who conversed with wildlife. The film introduced Harrison
to a new generation of young moviegoers. Earlier prominent roles
came in the 1940 film ``Major Barbara'' and ``Blithe Spirit'' in
1945.
   ``He had the best sense of humor of almost any actor I have ever
known,'' said his agent, Lawrence Evans, who worked with Harrison
for more than 40 years. ``He was a lovable, irascible man.''
   Harrison was born in Huyton, near Liverpool, on March 5, 1908,
and joined the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1924.
   His first appearance on the London stage was in 1930. By the end
of the decade he emerged as a star, appearing in Sir Terence
Rattigan's ``French Without Tears'' from 1936 to 1938. He last
appeared on the London stage in ``The Admirable Crichton'' in 1988.
   In addition to his awards for ``My Fair Lady,'' Harrison won a
Tony for his portrayal of Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson's ``Anne of
the Thousand Days'' and a special American Theater Award for his
overall stage achievements.
   He was knighted last year by Queen Elizabeth II and described the
event as ``a marvelous moment.''
   Harrison, dubbed ``Sexy Rexy'' by the late columnist Walter
Winchell, was married six times. He is survived by his wife, Mercia
Tinker; a sister; two sons by previous marriages; and several
grandchildren.
   He first married in 1934 to Collette Thomas, a French teacher. He
married actress Lili Palmer in 1943 and she accompanied him as he
extended his career to the United States.
   In 1957, Harrison married actress Kay Kendall, who died of
leukemia in 1959. Rattigan said of those times: ``I realized Rex's
great courage. He made the last two years of Kay's life the best
years.''
   Years later, Harrison starred in Rattigan's ``In Praise of
Love,'' the story of a man whose wife is dying of an incurable
disease and is forbidden by doctors from telling her.
   Harrison married English actress Rachel Roberts in 1962. He then
married Elizabeth Harris, and then Miss Tinker.
   The funeral will be private, but there will be a public memorial
service June 18 at the Little Church Around the Corner in Manhattan.
Harrison requested that the service feature jazz music, Schiff said.
   In lieu of flowers, the family asked instead for contributions to
establish a Rex Harrison Scholarship in Drama at Boston University
and to benefit collections at the school and at the Actor's Fund in
Englewood, N.J., or the Little Church Around the Corner.

   Ken Wahl is leaving the ``Wiseguy'' TV series
he has starred in since 1987, but a dispute remains over whether he
really wanted to go.
   The actor says he was fired by the show's executive producer,
Stephen J. Cannell.
   Not so, says Cannell, one of Hollywood's leading
writer-producers. ``I still want him to do the show,'' he said.
   But, he added, that Wahl wrote to him saying he wanted out.
   Wahl, speaking by phone from Mexico where he is making a movie,
said the letters were written ``only to get their lawyers off my
back, because I had no intention of leaving the show.''
   The Wahl-Cannell flap surfaced after CBS announced last week that
it was pulling ``Wiseguy'' from its prime-time schedule for
retooling. Once it returns at midseason, Wahl is to leave after a
few episodes while Steven Bauer is introduced as the new star.
   Wahl said the trouble between himself and the show's producers
began last season when an old injury flared up. ``They didn't
believe the doctors and they didn't believe me about being hurt,''
he said.
   Later, he said, Cannell told him he was unhappy with the show and
wanted to revamp it. ``He thought that he'd get into creative
arguments with me. So he said, `Why don't we shake hands and leave
it go at that?','' Wahl said.

   Actor Robert Redford called Saturday for a surge in
grass-roots political action to force politicians to move quickly on
environmental issues.
   ``Poll after poll indicates that the people are way ahead of the
politicians,'' Redford said. ``It is time to send a message to our
elected officials _ that if they do not protect our environment,
they will be voted out of office or never get elected in the first
place.''
   ``I don't think we need to wait around anymore for something to
come from the top,'' he said. ``It ain't gonna happen. I don't want
to be told, `Read my lips' when the lips aren't saying anything.''
   During commencement ceremonies at the University of Massachusetts
campus near Boston Harbor, Redford said President Bush failed to
follow up on campaign promises on the environment.
   ``President Bush made Boston Harbor a big campaign item, but
after the election, when there were no more TV ads, he cut funding
that would have cleaned it up by $400 million,'' Redford said.
   Redford, who received an honorary doctorate, also encouraged
students to buy environmentally safe products. ``If you stop buying
things that destroy the planet, companies will stop making them,''
he said.
   Redford, star of such films as ``The Sting'' and ``Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid,'' is the founder and president of the
Institute for Resource Management, which sponsored a conference on
global warming last summer.

   Former world heavyweight boxing champ Larry Holmes
threw his weight around in court for a family friend.
   He appeared in Dade District Court on behalf of 19-year-old Saudi
Rogers, who was arrested twice last year on drug charges and wanted
to be released early from house arrest.
   The fighter told Judge Fred Moreno that he believed Rogers could
be trusted and said he helped the youth get a job at a Jacksonville
hotel.
   ``He's on a straight line, and I wouldn't be here if he wasn't,''
Holmes said.
   The judge granted the request Friday, saying, ``I have a feeling
if he screwed up you could take care of him probably better than
me.''
   The court appearance by Holmes, a longtime friend of Rogers'
widowed mother, generated a crowd of autograph seekers that included
lawyers, bailiffs, guards, police officers and defendants.
   Some of the spectators were begging for sheets of paper from
legal pads to have something for Holmes to write on.

   Former North Carolina State basketball
coach Jim Valvano said Saturday ``it's very likely'' that he will
sign a contract to become a basketball analyst for ABC.
   ``It's a bit premature for me to say anything,'' Valvano said
before teeing off in a charity golf tournament. ``We're hopeful that
things will be worked out.''
   Valvano also said he expected the deal to be announced by ABC on
Monday.
   The former coach, who was forced to resign in April after
irregularities were disclosed in the Wolfpack basketball program,
said he would continue to live in Raleigh.
   The Greensboro News &amp; Record also reported that Valvano would
sign a three-year, $900,000 contract to become color analyst for ABC
and ESPN next season. Neither network would confirm the report, the
newspaper said.

   Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson's
$85,000 Mercedes is taking an impounding. And he may lose the car if
a certain bill isn't paid.
   Tyson's 1990 gold Mercedes-Benz 500SL convertible _ with car
phone and leather interior _ has been sitting in the city of
Hudson's car pound for nearly a month. At week's end, he owed $126
for towing and storage fees.
   City officials mailed a notice to Tyson on Thursday, advising him
that he has to reclaim the car within 10 days of receipt of the
letter or else lose it to the city of Hudson. An auction may be held
by late June.
   The car was impounded May 2 after police arrested 31-year-old
Isadore Philip Bolton, described as a Tyson aide, for driving it
without license plates and a registration.
   Sgt. Eugene Shetsky, who's in charge of the city's impounded
cars, said he doesn't like the car just lying around, adding:
``There are a lot of other things to think about than an $85,000
car.''

<HEAD>Bush Decisions on China, Lithuania Set Stage for Trade Pact</HEAD>

   True, there were some 11th-hour
negotiations. But the seeds of President Bush's decision to grant
trade concessions to the Soviet Union were sown in his renewal of
trade benefits for the Chinese and his refusal to impose sanctions
against Moscow over Lithuania.
   Bush's action meant that for the second time in as many weeks, he
was ignoring widespread congressional opposition to a trade
agreement with a regime whose human rights policies have been
sharply criticized.
   Bush's earlier renewal of trade benefits to China and his
decision not to slap economic sanctions on Moscow over its hardline
approach in the Baltic states made it harder for him to say no to an
anxious Gorbachev, some aides are suggesting.
   If Bush won any private assurances from Gorbachev on Lithuania in
exchange for the trade deal, neither side was letting on.
   U.S. officials insisted that Bush did not extract any such
commitment from Gorbachev; and Soviet officials continue to
characterize the stalemate as an internal dispute that they will
resolve themselves.
   U.S. sources said that, even though Soviet officials balked at
the last minute at signing a grain deal, Bush's mind was not made up
by this last minute Soviet attempt at haggling.
   Instead, Gorbachev's fervent, direct appeal for the agreement and
Bush's desire to help strengthen the hand of the embattled Soviet
leader at home had more bearing on his decision, the officials.
   ``It was quite obvious that Gorbachev was seeking something on
the economic front. It's obviously something that he wanted to take
home,'' said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet leader himself made it clear in his comments to
congressional leaders on Friday at the Soviet Embassy that he sorely
wanted the trade pact.
   And, in fact, Gorbachev himself raised the specter of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown in noting that the United States had
extended its most-favored-nation trade hand to Beijing _ but not to
Moscow.
   Gorbachev pressed the same points in meetings with Bush both on
Thursday and on Friday, said an administration official. At one
point, Bush even expressed frustration that the Supreme Soviet had
not yet acted on-long pending legislation to codify more-liberal
emigration policies, sources said.
   The Soviet leader told Bush he would make an even harder effort
to get the law passed, the sources said.
   Sources said Gorbachev's forceful pleas, together with Bush's
historical bias against economic sanctions, helped the Soviet leader
win his case.
   As Bush and Gorbachev relaxed at the U.S. presidential retreat
here in the Cactoctin Mountains of Maryland on Saturday, the
divisive trade decision was behind them and they went on to other
issues.
   But the Bush administration still faces a likely battle in
Congress as the president tries to win approval of the new
agreement. A tough battle is also expected on the China move.
   With China, Bush renewed already existing most-favored-nation
status for another year. But the Soviet Union has not had
most-favored-nation status since 1952, when it was revoked by
Congress. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act requires
a country to have both a trade agreement with the United States and
a law allowing free emigration before it can be granted
most-favored-nation status.
   In giving Gorbachev the trade agreement _ the first part of the
equation _ Bush also attached a short string. He told the Soviet
leader he would not even send the measure to Congress for approval
until the Supreme Soviet passes the emigration law.
   However, the strings extended only to emigration policy, not
Lithuania. And the absence of any Soviet concessions on Lithuania is
what is likely to stir the most opposition. The Senate passed a
resolution May 1 urging Bush to hold off granting
most-favored-nation status to the Soviets until they lifted the
blockade against Lithuania.
   Administration officials are backpeddling _ trying to assert that
there never had been a link between trade and Lithuania.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday, ``There has
been no formal linkage by anybody in this administration that I am
aware of'' between the two issues. Baker didn't place it there, but
the emphasis clearly was on the word ``formal'' since before the
summit one official after another had informally linked the trade
pact with progress on two fronts: the Soviet emigration law and
Lithuania.

   A pro-PLO Palestinian leader in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip said Saturday that U.S. targets in the
region might be attacked as anti-American sentiment intensifies.
   ``I'm thinking of people who will just want to express their
anger, both against American symbols and American institutions,''
Palestinian intellectual Sari Nusseibeh said in an interview.
   He said he and others who have urged restraint are becoming
increasingly isolated.
   Palestinians are angered by Washington's veto of a U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for a council-appointed team to be sent
to the occupied lands to report on Israeli abuses.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Don Cofman said U.S. officials ``are aware
of the mood in the territories,'' but he declined comment when asked
whether additional steps had been taken to protect Americans.
   The U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory for the Middle
East on Thursday, urging Americans to use ``extreme caution.'' The
advisory cited the recent upsurge of violence.
   Cofman also refused comment on reports confirmed by Israeli
officials that the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv's beachfront hotel
district was one of the targets of Palestinian guerrillas
intercepted by Israeli forces off the coast Wednesday. Four
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured in the failed sea raid.
   The Palestine Liberation Front of Mohammed Abbas claimed its
guerrillas were involved.
   The Front is a faction of the PLO and on Saturday Kuwait's
al-Watan newspaper quoted Abbas as apologizing for not informing PLO
leader Yasser Arafat in advance of the failed attack. Abbas said,
however, that more attacks will be launched against Israel.
   Arafat has disassociated the PLO from the operation but has
stopped short of condemning it outright. The U.S. State Department
has left open the possibility that the operation could affect the
U.S.-PLO dialogue begun after Arafat renounced terrorism in December
1988.
   Wednesday's incident was the latest in an upsurge of violence
that began with the May 20 massacre of seven Arab laborers by an
Israeli gunman. Israeli security forces killed 16 Palestinians and
hurt hundreds in subsequent protests.
   Two Israelis were killed in retaliation, including a 72-year-old
man who died in a bomb explosion in Jerusalem.
   In the Gaza Strip on Saturday, five Palestinian teen-agers were
wounded by army gunfire in clashes, Arab doctors said. An army
official said he was checking the reports.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori said Saturday that police
dismantled a bomb attached to a gas balloon in a Jerusalem
restaurant. The bomb was discovered after police noticed four masked
youths near the restaurant and began searching the area, he said.
   On the northern outskirts of Jerusalem, ultra-Orthodox Jewish
youths gathered along a main thoroughfare and stoned Arab-owned
cars, Israel radio said.
   Nusseibeh, described by Israel as one of the heads behind the
30-month Palestinian uprising, said young Arab activists are
increasingly pressuring for more violence against Israel.
   He said the Arabs in the occupied lands are rapidly losing hope
that a peace settlement can be reached. He blamed hard-line Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has rejected U.S. proposals for a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   ``There is going to be a rapid deterioration into a cycle of
bloodshed and violence,'' Nusseibeh told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview Saturday.
   ``I believe more and more Palestinians will turn to using guns
and explosives. I assume that the Unified Leadership will probably
go with the people,'' said Nusseibeh, referring to the underground
umbrella group of various PLO factions coordinating the uprising.
   ``It's quite possible that there will also be attacks against
American targets,'' he said.
   Until now, the uprising leadership has ordered activists to stick
to stones and firebombs, saying that the use of firearms would only
give Israel an excuse to crack down harder.
   On Friday, Palestinian leaders including Nusseibeh declared a
boycott on contacts with U.S. diplomats and called on the Arab world
to boycott U.S.-made goods to protest the U.S. veto in the Security
Council.
   In response, the 15,000-member Gaza Strip Trade Union Federation
on Saturday called on workers in the Arab world to refuse servicing
U.S. planes and ships on Tuesday. That day marks the 23rd
anniversary of the start of the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.

<HEAD>Algae Muddies Clear Lake; Ballot Proposal Would Create Special
Distict</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS penultimate graf to CORRECT spelling of Karan.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LAKEPORT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clear Lake is anything but _ as anyone
who's seen the algae blanketing its surface can attest.
   But supporters of Measure A on Tuesday's ballot aim to make North
America's oldest lake worthy of its name. It would establish an
``algae abatement district,'' similar to mosquito abatement
districts, water districts and fire districts.
   With an average depth of about 35 feet, Clear Lake's warm water
is host to a delicate ecosystem and more than 100 varieties of
algae, including three kinds of blue-green ``nuisance'' algae.
   Usually, the algae goes unnoticed by scores of bass anglers and
tourists who flock to the lake for fun and fishing.
   ``All we need is a good afternoon breeze to blow it away,'' said
Bob Mingori, president of the Lake County Chamber of Commerce.
``Generally, it's the sign of a healthy lake.''
   But every so often, on no particular schedule, the algae
``blooms,'' creating a thick, smelly, oil-like slick. When it rots,
it creates methane gas that kills fish, and the stink chases away
tourists.
   Fed up with debates and studies, Sylvia Savage modeled Measure A
after another nuisance: the mosquito.
   Savage's proposal would require Lake County to set aside money
for algae cleanup. ``I want to immediately start reducing it by
getting boats and water barges and vacuuming that algae up,'' said
Savage.
   She said that a similar effort in 1985 cleaned a one-mile area
and scooped up more than 200 pounds of algae in less than one hour.
   But critics of Measure A fear it could drain county funds.
Instead, residents hardest hit by the algae outbreaks can control
the problem privately by pumping air into the water or spraying it
down with hoses, they maintain.
   County Supervisor Karan Mackey said it would be irresponsible to
create a second special district when the mosquito district could
handle the algae challenge.
   ``We are not trying to make this lake clear,'' Mackey said. ``It
has never been clear.''

<HEAD>Indian Journalist, Moslem Shopkeeper Kidnapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men posing as army officers on
Saturday kidnapped a local journalist reporting on the Moslem
separatist movement in Kashmir for Western news organizations,
officials said.
   Hours later a Moslem shopkeeper also was abducted in a similar
manner, said the officials who cannot be identified under briefing
rules. No one claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings,
and it was not immediately clear if the two incidents were related.
   The kidnappings occurred during a break in a curfew. Hundreds of
people have died in violence since a government crackdown on
separatists began in January.
   Officials said journalist Yusuf Jameel, a Kashmiri Moslem who has
reported for Time magazine, the British Broadcasting Corp. and
Reuters, was led away from his home in Srinagar. The city is the
summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state and the cradle of the movement
to secede from mostly Hindu India.
   A servant of Jameel, Hakim Din, said two men wearing army
officers' uniforms arrived at the house in a jeep similar to ones
used by the military and demanded to meet the reporter.
   Jameel's colleague, photographer Mehraj Uddin, who also lives in
the house, said Jameel told him: ``I am being arrested by the army.
Take care of yourself.''
   The government denied Jameel was arrested or taken away by ``any
of the security forces or the army for helping any investigation.''
   A state government spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said officials suspect foul play by people bent on
``maligning the administration and the security forces.''
   He said the police registered the case as a kidnapping and
started investigations ``in the right earnest to trace out Mr.
Jameel and culprits.''
   Jameel also has reported for The Telegraph, a major Indian daily
based in Calcutta.
   Four hours after Jameel's disappearance, two men wearing military
uniforms who arrived in a jeep took away a shopkeeper, Ghulam
Mohammad Gujwari, in another Srinagar neighborhood, the government
officials said.
   Residents on Saturday used the curfew break, the first in 12 days
in Srinagar, to stock up on sorely needed food supplies. A
combination of round-the-clock curfews imposed by the government and
strikes ordered by Moslem militants have made daily life difficult
in the city.
   At least 486 people have been killed since January in Kashmir,
the scenic valley comprising Srinagar and neighboring districts.
Most of the victims were militants or supporters of the separatist
campaign.
   Kashmir was divided along a still-disputed frontier between India
and Pakistan after British colonial Inida became independent in 1947
and was partitioned along religious lines.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the territory, in
1947-48 and 1965.
   Relations between the two nations have sunk to their lowest point
in years over the Kashmir issue. India accuses Pakistan of funding
and training the militants. Pakistan denies the claim and says India
is crushing a movement for self-determination.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in India-governed
Jammu-Kashmir are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent
of India's 880 million people while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   A doctor was killed in his apartment kitchen by a
stray ``one-in-a-million'' bullet when two young men sprayed
semiautomatic rifle fire at random, police said Saturday.
   Andre Crump, 20, surrendered to police Friday, and Anton Abdalla,
20, was arrested later that night, said police Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   Both face murder charges in the Friday morning slaying of Dr.
Jolaolu Mojola, 60, in Manhattan's Harlem section.
   The two men fired about 15 shots in a pair of bursts using a
semiautomatic .22-caliber rifle, police said. One bullet flew
through Mojola's third-floor window and hit the doctor as he walked
out of his bathroom.
   ``Something hit me in the chest!'' the victim reportedly called
out to his wife before collapsing. Emergency medical workers
pronounced him dead at the scene.
   ``It was a proverbial one-in-a-million shot,'' said police Capt.
Daniel McKenna. ``Six inches in another direction, and it would have
hit a brick wall and not him.''
   Other residents of the building narrowly escaped injury. A woman
lying on a couch in her fifth-floor apartment watched two bullets
slam into her ceiling, while another bullet went into a first-floor
room.
   Mojola was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and went to medical school in
London. He came to the United States in 1961.
   The gynecologist worked for 10 years at hospitals before going
into teaching, consulting and writing.

   The state suspended the license of a
practical nurse accused of slashing the intravenous tubes of seven
hospital patients, officials said.
   Friday's action against Kenneth A. Closs, 38, of North Lauderdale
was the first emergency suspension of a Florida nurse since 1985,
said Larry Gonzalez, secretary of the state Department of
Professional Regulation.
   Closs, arrested Thursday on eight counts of violating the state's
anti-tampering law, remained in custody Saturday at the Broward
County Jail on $52,500 bond. One count was dismissed Friday after
Magistrate Barry S. Seltzer ruled the charge defective.
   Deputies say Closs admitted cutting the tubes over the Memorial
Day weekend, saying he wanted to embarrass University Hospital in
the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Tamarac for disciplining him. No one
was injured.
   Detectives have expanded their investigation into allegations
that Closs kept drugs intended for his patients.
   Hospital spokeswoman Lynn Farber said two patients complained
last month of not receiving medication. In one case the medication
was Demerol, an addictive painkiller.
   ``The meds were signed out to Closs,'' she said.
   The first slashing May 26 came five days after Closs' supervisor
reprimanded him, took away his key to a narcotics cabinet, barred
him from dispensing medications and offered him a chance to seek
professional help, Farber said.
   Closs refused the offer, she said.
   Deputies said eight tubes to seven fourth-floor patients were
cut. Closs worked the overnight shift on the fourth floor, and most
of the tubes were slashed on his shift.

<HEAD>Two Journalists Gunned Down In Prime Minister's Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two journalists were killed Saturday,
just minutes after completing reports about the ethnic violence that
has turned Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's home province into a
battleground, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the slayings of Ahmed Khan
Kamal, a correspondent for Pakistan Press International, a small,
privately-owned news agency, and Muthair Naqpit, with Nawa-e-Waqt, a
leading Urdu-language daily.
   The slayings occurred outside the telegraph in Larkana, Ms.
Bhutto's home town, 200 miles north of Karachi.
   Karachi, however, showed signs of returning to normalcy. Shops
and offices opened and traffic clogged the streets during a curfew
break free of the random shootings that have brought the city of 8
million to a virtual standstill.
   For nearly three weeks ethnic violence has plagued southern Sindh
Province, where more than 350 people have died and thousands have
been wounded.
   The trouble is rooted in deep hatred between native Sindhis and
the Mohajirs, descendants of Moslem Indians who immigrated to
Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the subcontinent. Sindhis
accuse the better-educated Mohajirs of taking the best jobs and most
valuable land.
   Police blame the violence on a militant faction of the Mohajir
Qami Movement, which is demanding that the Mohajirs be recognized as
Pakistan's fifth nationality, along with the Pathans, Punjabis,
Baluch and Sindhis.
   The violence forced has authorities to impose tough security
measures, including indefinite curfews and checkpoints manned by
heavily-armed soldiers.
   Ms. Bhutto has called out the army to help local security forces
restore law and order to the province, and on Saturday, troops
started to crackdown on violence.
   The army announced that loudspeakers at mosques, a main source of
inciting violence, could only be used to call worshipers to prayer.
It also issued shoot-to-kill orders for anyone caught looting or
setting fire to property.
   On Friday, officials said soldiers in Sindh arrested more than
1,000 people suspected of ordering the violence, which began May 15.
   Most of the violence has been in Karachi and in Hyderabad, a city
of 3 million 150 miles to the north.
   Kamal and Naqpit, however, were gunned down outside the local
telegraph office in Larkana after sending stories to their papers
about a news conference with Sindhi nationalists. Gunmen surrounded
the reporters, opened fire then fled, police said.
   A correspondent for Pakistan's largest Urdu daily, Jang, was shot
and killed earlier in the week at the press club in Khaipur, 170
miles northwest of Karachi. Police said the motive was not clear.
   Ms. Bhutto has acknowledged the Sindh government led by her
Pakistan People's Party has not done enough to stem the rising
violence. But she blames neighboring India for stirring much of the
trouble.
   New Delhi has denied the allegations.

   Ethipian rebels said Saturday they will
release a Cuban physician and nurse to U.S. diplomats five months
after the two were captured in the fall of a town near the Sudanese
border.
   The U.S. Embassy will take custody of the two on Thursday and fly
them to London, said T. Ebba, spokesman for the rebel Oromo
Liberation Front. The Cuban government will take charge there, he
said.
   In Cairo, Egypt, Counselor Abdul-Rahman Hamza of the Sudanese
Embassy, who first announced the planned release, said he was not
told how the United States came to be involved in the case. The U.S.
Embassy in Khartoum was closed for the weekend and officials could
not be reached for comment.
   Cuba, a supporter of Ethiopia's Marxist government and an
opponent of the United States, has diplomatic relations with Sudan
but no embassy in Khartoum. In Cairo, Cuban Ambassador Jorge Cubiles
Hernandes said he knew nothing of the plan.
   The captive Cubans, Dr. Pedro Ulaka, 35, and Jolanda Hernandez,
23, both of Havana, disappeared in the first week of January with
four other Cuban medical personnel.
   All six were working at Asosa, in far western Ethiopia just east
of the Sudanese border, when the area came under attack from
anti-government forces.
   The Oromo Liberation Front, a tribal resistance group active
since the early 1970s, claimed the Asosa victory.
   Two of the Cubans were released in April in San`a, Yemen.
   Hamza said two will remain captives after Thursday's release but
that the Sudanese government was still trying to gain their release.
They ``are in good health,'' he said.
   Hamza said the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum already has acted as
go-between once this year, previously in the release of Poles held
by Ethiopian rebels.
   U.S. diplomats teamed with Polish government representatives in
January to free 30 Poles held for 20 days by rebels from Eritrea in
northeastern Ethiopia. They were seized from a ship that came under
fire because rebels suspected it was running guns to the Addis Ababa
government.

<HEAD>Quality Problems at Veterans Hospitals Cited by Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quality standards at VA medical centers
generally lagged behind those of other hospitals in a survey made by
a national accrediting group, officials confirmed Saturday.
   Veterans Affairs Department officials said Saturday they were
concerned about the results of the survey by the group that
accredits most of the nation's hospitals and will move quickly to
make changes where problems can be remedied.
   The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care
Organizations, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., studied 116 of the
172 VA centers that provide medical care to 3.5 million veterans
annually.
   It found the centers at least 20 percent more likely than other
hospitals to fall below quality standards in the areas of emergency
services, special care services, surgery and anesthesia services,
surgical case review, alcohol and drug treatment planning and fire
safety. It did not name any centers.
   The Los Angeles Times, in editions last week, quoted William
Jessee, the commission's vice president for accreditation surveys,
as saying the VA had ``a seriously aging infrastructure in its
health care facilities.''
   Jessee said the VA had not been ``adequately funded to bring
these physical plants up to current life-safety standards.''
   VA spokesman Don Smith acknowledged that a number of problems
were found at centers on the West Coast, particularly in the area of
record-keeping.
   ``We recognize a necessity'' to keep better records, Smith said
in an interview Saturday. ``We haven't been doing it in some
instances and we need to do that.''
   Smith said, however, that record-keeping problems were not the
same as deficiencies in providing care. He added that he did not
``think that the recitation of the commission's findings will shake
the system to its roots.''
   ``I don't want to excuse them, though, and I don't think the
system wants to excuse them,'' he added.
   Don Avant, a special assistant to the commission president, said
in a telephone interview there were many ``good people'' in the
veterans health care system, but he added that the department was
``bureaucratic.''
   The department asked the commission to make the study in response
to a request from Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   On a system with a maximum score of 100 the average for the
veterans centers was 69.8 while that of the average of 5,182 other
hospitals was 77. Hospitals are surveyed every three years for
accreditation purposes.
   Under the system, a score of 90 merits a ``commendation'' rating,
while anything lower than 50 puts a hospital on a probationary
status.
   Six percent of veterans hospitals received 87.5 points or more in
the study, compared with about 25 percent of other hospitals. But 16
percent of the veterans institutions scored 57.5 or fewer points,
compared with 4 percent among other hospitals.
   Smith said six veterans medical centers are on ``conditional
accreditation'' status: Long Beach, Sepulveda and Palo Alto in
California; Portland and Roseburg in Oregon; and Walla Walla in
Washington.
   He said all veterans hospitals are accredited.

   Leftist rebels attacked army
positions Saturday just west of San Salvador, residents said, in the
second day of intensified fighting in the 10-year-old civil war.
   Guerrilla commander Jorge Melendez, speaking on clandestine rebel
Radio Venceremos, said the insurgents are trying to pressure the
government into negotiating an end to the war.
   The fighting took place in Ciudad Merliot, seven miles west of
San Salvador, the capital. The residents, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they knew of no casualties.
   The armed forces said 15 guerrillas were killed and 25 wounded in
fighting with army troops Friday along the Pan-American highway 45
miles east of San Salvador in San Vicente province.
   A rebel camp was destroyed, the armed forces press office said.
It did not say if any government troops were killed or wounded.
   Also Friday, urban guerrilla commandos blew up more than 20
utility poles and high-tension wire towers, leaving a third of the
country without power on the first anniversary of President Alfredo
Cristiani's presidency.
   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
pledged when he took office to work for peace.
   Representatives of the U.S.-backed government and the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrillas' organization,
agreed in May on an agenda for talks to achieve peace in about a
year.
   More than 71,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed
during the war in this Central American country of about 5.5 million
people.

   A bomb exploded at an army training
base near this southern town Saturday, wounding two officers, police
reported.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the bomb was planted at the entrance to the
complex on a hill 10 miles west of Nabatiyeh.
   He said the wounded were a captain and a lieutenant, but declined
to give their names. Army headquarters in Beirut declined to comment.
   Police said the explosion caused some damage but gave no details.
   The one-story building on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean
was a military radar base before the civil war broke out in 1975.
   The radar equipment was removed several years ago and the
facility has been used as a training base, mainly for Shiite Moslem
soldiers serving in south Lebanon.
   Most of the troops in the south sympathize with the Syrian-backed
Shiite Amal militia, which has been fighting with the
fundamentalist, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, since
mid-1987.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 3,000 wounded in that
power struggle for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect.

<TEXT>
   What seemed like a good idea to Genevieve
McLaughlin _ donating the $1,200 her retirement party would cost to
charity _ failed to go over with a committee appointed by her
employer, Independence Blue Cross.
   Spokesman Dick Mendenhall announced the panel's decision Friday,
saying the non-profit health insurance company would not donate the
money but will continue to pick up the tab for retirement lunches at
a fancy hotel for employees of a decade or more.
   The $1,200 lunches are complete with flowers, photographs and a
$100 gift certificate. The guest of honor can invite up to 35
co-workers, and a handful of managers attend.
   Ms. McLaughlin thought a better use for the money would be
donations to her favorite charities: St. John's Hospice and her
grandson's Little League team.
   Mendenhall explained why the committee, which was appointed to
study the issue, disagreed.
   ``The point of this sort of luncheon is to honor the person
through a gathering of associates and friends, for reminiscence,
camaraderie and so on,'' said Mendenhall. ``These luncheons are
entirely voluntary. ... If the person doesn't want a luncheon, then
we don't have one.''
   Mendenhall said donating the money would defeat the purpose:
``The intent of the recognition is to encourage interaction with
other employees.''
   Ms. McLaughlin, 64, believes she won despite the decision.
   ``I brought this to a head, and I know that between the news
reports, other companies are going to read about it and maybe
somebody out there is going to have a heart and say, `We're going to
let the employees have what they want,''' she said.
   ``Maybe somebody will even want to sponsor a Little League team.''
   Blue Cross told Ms. McLaughlin she could still have a going-away
luncheon, but she's still not interested.
   The former Medicare claims adjuster made a few waves with her
request. After her story was reported in the Philadelphia Daily
News, a reader wrote the paper suggesting that she think about
running for local office.
   Another letter writer, a 15-year Blue Cross employee, worried
that the company might decide to drop the lunches altogether.
   ``I want mine,'' she wrote.

   The sound of a battering ram used in a
drug raid at a neighbor's apartment spooked a man who hopped out his
window into the waiting arms of a police officer in the right place
at the right time.
   Poor balance combined with bad timing to aid in the arrest when
the man tossed a small bag of cocaine to the ground while fleeing,
then ``looked back to see where it was ... and he tripped,'' police
Cmdr. Rudy Legenza said Saturday.
   Legenza arrested the man Friday for investigation of cocaine
possession and resisting arrest. Thought to be an undocumented
alien, the man was being held by immigration authorities. His name
was withheld.
   ``We were going for apartment 5, but apparently the man in
apartment 4 thought his apartment was being raided,'' Legenza said.
``He jumped out through a window and landed on me.''
   The arrest of the man dashing from his first-floor apartment was
``an easy catch _ so to speak,'' he said.
   Three people from the other apartment were arrested for
investigation of various drug charges, police said.
   Police knew of no links between the neighbors.

<HEAD>Injection of Healthy Muscle Cells Into Dystrophy Victims Called
Promising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new procedure using healthy muscle cells
may help correct the protein defect that causes the most common
childhood form of muscular dystrophy, a researcher said Saturday.
   In a preliminary study, the genetic therapy called myoblast
transfer produced a protein whose absence due to a gene defect
causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, said Dr. Peter K. Law of the
University of Tennessee-Memphis at the Muscular Dystrophy
Association's meeting here.
   The degenerative neuromuscular disease strikes young boys almost
exclusively.
   ``Until now, we have been dealing with children that are dying _
a disease that so far has had no hope, no treatment and no cure,''
Law said. ``For that reason, I feel that the development of this
work is very important.''
   The procedure involves injecting healthy muscle cells of an
adult, often a sibling or parent, into the youth with Duchenne
dystrophy, researchers said.
   Law said the therapy as the first effective treatment for
Duchenne, but not as a total cure, because it is still unknown how
much function children will develop with it or how much longer they
will live.
   Duchenne victims usually die in their teens or young adult years.
   Law's study found that a big-toe muscle injected with healthy,
immature muscle cells produced dystrophin, the protein missing from
those with the disease.
   ``Our intention is to furnish the muscle with the missing
formula, the missing recipe, the blueprint,'' said Dr. Leon I.
Charash, a neurological specialist in New York who is the chairman
of the MDA's Medical Advisory Committee. ``The concept is giving the
cells what they missed.''
   The researchers noted that the studies were still very
preliminary, but said research on the therapy in Canada has produced
similar results.
   ``These are the first known clinical tests in the world of this
therapy, so the results will require extremely cautious and lengthy
analysis,'' Law said. ``But if all goes as planned, if our work
remains on schedule, we hope to bring this forth as a widespread
treatment by 1992.''
   Law said no adverse effects from the procedure or the
anti-rejection treatment were reported.
   Charash said the therapy, if successful, eventually could be
applied to other dystrophies.
   He also noted, however, that the therapy has been done on the
smallest of levels and will next be tried on larger muscles, as the
Canadian researchers have begun.
   ``Myoblast transfer holds great promise as a potential therapy
for muscular dystrophy and other devestating hereditary muscle
diseases,'' Charash said. ``Many more questions must be answered and
much remains to be done before the procedure can become a treatment,
but Dr. Law's finding is an exciting first sign of success.''
   Law's research, along with others, is funded by the MDA, which
oversees research, treatment and care for people with 40
neuromuscular diseases.
   The organization, based in New York, is moving its national
headquarters to Tucson.

   The Palestinian leader who claimed responsibility
for last week's failed raid against Israel said PLO chief Yasser
Arafat had no advance knowledge of the attack, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   Mohammed Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, also
pledged to carry out more raids against the Jewish state.
   ``We vow to continue the struggle until the objective of our
people in independence and liberation is achieved,'' Abbas said. He
was speaking in an interview with Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper. The
daily did not say where he was interviewed.
   ``We mean what we say. This operation is the beginning of a ...
combat effort against the Israeli enemy,'' he said.
   Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, was the mastermind of the 1985
hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro in the
Mediterranean. An American passenger in a wheelchair was killed in
that raid.
   The Palestine Liberation Front led by Abbas is a faction within
the PLO, but is not considered to be directly controlled by Arafat.
   Abbas was quoted as saying that Arafat had no knowledge of
Wednesday's foiled attack on Israel.
   ``It's true the PLO has nothing to do with the operation,'' Abbas
said. `We are under no obligation to inform Abu Ammar beforehand
about any operation.'' Abu Ammar is Arafat's nom de guerre.
   Arafat has disassociated the Palestine Liberation Organization
from the operation, but has stopped short of condemning the failed
raid.
   Arafat has also rejected Washington's demand that he expel Abbas
from the PLO's ruling executive committee. In December, Washington
began talks with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism.
   Arafat said the expulsion of Abbas could only be done by the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   Abbas also said the seaborne raid was not planned with Libyan or
Iraqi help. Israel has charged that Libya assisted in the planning
of the raid.
   Abbas said the foiled attack, in which four gunmen were killed
and 12 captured before they reached a beach crowded with Israeli
bathers, cost $3 million and had been planned for two years.
   He said the raid was launched as a message to the superpower
summit in Washington and to avenge the slaying of seven unarmed
Palestinian workers by an Israeli gunman near Tel Aviv on May 20.
   He said the raid carried two messages to the United States and
the Soviet Union, ``that the Palestinian people are determined to
continue their struggle until the liberation of Palestine and the
achievement of independence, and that ... they should be fully aware
that the influx of Jews into Palestine is a crime against
Palestinian human rights.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews are expected to immigrate to
Israel in the coming years.

   Fellow actors lamented the death of Rex Harrison on
Saturday, saying the gentle actor-knight will be remembered as much
for his civility and urbanity as for his versatility and skill as an
actor.
   Actor Edward Fox said Harrison's talent was like the sun: ``It's
difficult to give a name to, (but) you know when it's out.''
   Harrison died in New York early Saturday of pancreatic cancer at
age 82.
   ``He was the master of a certain kind of acting in which he
really was incomparable,'' said Dame Wendy Hiller, 77.
   ``There isn't anybody to put alongside him ... (his) subtlety and
skill and technical expertise,'' she said.
   She first starred with him in the 1941 film ``Major Barbara,''
based on the George Bernard Shaw play.
   They most recently appeared together in a British television
adaptation of ``The Kingfisher,'' a play in which Harrison performed
on Broadway in 1978.
   Over the years, Dame Wendy said she called Harrison ``Liverpool
virus'' and ``prop-ridden Harrison'' _ joking references to his
background and his fastidiousness with props during filming.
   ``We sort of agreed to disagree,'' Dame Wendy said, recalling
their ``good-natured sparring matches.''
   In New York, Julie Andrews, who performed with Harrison in ``My
Fair Lady'' for three years, said: ``To watch him and to work with
him was a joyful experience. I doubt there was anyone before like
him. ... The theater has lost an extraordinary one of a kind.''
   Audrey Hepburn, who played Eliza Doolittle opposite Harrison's
Professor Henry Higgins in the movie version of ``My Fair Lady,''
remembered him as ``a superb actor, the quintessential actor.''
   ``He was always thoughtful and helpful and fun, and I really
adored every minute I worked with him,'' she said from Switzerland.
   Claudette Colbert, who starred with Harrison in ``Aren't We
All?'' on Broadway, said in New York: ``I am terribly sorry. I think
it was a great loss to the theater. ... He was a great, great
comedian.''
   Actress Lynn Redgrave, who also starred in ``Aren't We All?'' in
1985, called Harrison ``the master of high comedy playing.''
   ``Nobody knows how to do what he did. He gave high comedy a
danger, accuracy and razor sharpness, and at the same time it
appeared to be completely effortless. You could never see the joke
coming,'' she said from San Diego.
   Edward Fox, who co-starred with Harrison in his final London
stage appearance, a 1988 revival of ``The Admirable Crichton,'' said
he ``was that very rare thing _ a great actor.''
   ``I remember him with great affection and with great
admiration,'' said Fox, who called Harrison's London performance as
Chekhov's Platonov in 1960 ``one of the great evenings in the
theater.''
   Michael Winner, the film director and a longtime acquaintance,
called Harrison ``the last of the old-style sophisticates. He had
this great, great star quality of charm.''
   ``When an actor like Sir Rex dies, then you realize it's the
passing of a style that won't come again,'' said Rosemary Harris,
who starred with Harrison in London and on Broadway in 1983-84 in
Shaw's ``Heartbreak House.''
   The play afforded Harrison one of his finest roles _ as the
bearded, ever philosophical Captain Shotover, presiding over the
teetering ``ship of state'' that is Britain.
   ``He was sublime,'' Harris said of Harrison's performance in the
play.
   She said she last saw Harrison six weeks ago in New York when she
presented him with a special Drama League award for outstanding
achievement in the theater.
   Preparing for the presentation, Harris said she was struck by the
unexpected breadth of Harrison's career.
   ``I realized what a thoroughly cosmopolitan man he is,'' she
said. ``How many actors have gone from playing Siamese kings to
British royalty? That's quite a span, isn't it?''
   Harris herself returns to the London stage in October to star in
W. Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle,'' in which Harrison played on
Broadway last season.

<HEAD>Vietnam Allows Top Defector to See Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist government for the first time
has allowed the family of a high-level defector to go abroad to
visit him and it is considering letting him return from China, an
official said Saturday.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the move was meant as a gesture of good will toward China
before the visit of Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem to Beijing.
   It will be Liem's third round of talks in China on the Cambodian
civil war and other barriers to normalizing ties between Vietnam and
China.
   The Vietnamese government allowed the wife and daughter of
87-year-old defector Hoang Van Hoan _ a founding member of the
Vietnamese Communist Party _ to travel to Beijing to visit him last
month, the government official said.
   The decision was made by the Politburo, the highest body of
Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, he said.
   The official also said the Chinese government last month asked
Vietnam to let Hoan return home. No decision has been made, the
official said.
   But he added, ``People tend to think it's about time to take him
back; even some high-ranking officials think so.''
   Hoan, a member of the Politburo from 1957 to 1976, was the first
top Vietnamese leader to defect to China.
   Hoan disappeared at Karachi airport in Pakistan in July 1979. A
month later he surfaced in Beijing, he attacked the Vietnamese party
leadership, saying it was guilty of using ``Stalinist'' methods and
abandoning friendship with China for the Soviet Union. Hoan called
for a revolution in Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese official who spoke Saturday said Hoan had also
published a Vietnamese-language newsletter critical of Hanoi while
he was in China.
   Vietnam and China were allies during the Vietnam War, but they
had a falling-out in 1978 over border disputes, Vietnam's treatment
of its ethnic Chinese population and growing Vietnamese-Soviet ties.
   China launched a brief border attack in early 1979, saying it
wanted to ``punish'' Vietnam for invading Cambodia and toppling the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge government.
   China continues to arm the Khmer Rouge and two other guerrilla
groups now fighting the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia.
   However, relations with China have improved during Liem's three
visits to Beijing over the past 15 months.
   An assistant Chinese foreign minister, Xu Dunxin, is to arrive in
Hanoi on June 9 to continue the talks on Cambodia and normalizing
relations. Xu will be leading the first senior Chinese delegation to
Vietnam since 1979.

   Smaller, clearer and more powerful are the
watchwords for this year's innovations at the Consumer Electronics
Show, where tens of thousands of audio, video and home-automation
products went on display Saturday.
   Digital audio tape, the long-awaited technology that will give
taped sound a quantum leap in quality, finally hits the American
marketplace this fall, when Secaucus, N.J.-based Technics said it
will begin shipping its first player to U.S. retailers.
   ``We are actively taking orders at the show and are sure that it
will be off the ground this time,'' said Michael Aguilar, a
spokesman for the company, a division of the Matsushita Electric
Corp. of America.
   The SVDA10 player marketed by Technics, suggested to retail at
$1,200, will incorporate a ``copy management system'' conforming
with the new technology standard adopted in Japan to foil pirating
attempts and head off copryright disputes, Aguilar said.
   A fear of such disputes is what has kept manufacturers from
marketing DAT technology in the United States, even though it has
been available for at least three years.
   Technics has also teamed with movie director George Lucas to
produce Home THX, an advanced sound system designed, by one account,
``to have spaceships whizzing by your ears while you sit watching
`Star Wars' in your easy chair.''
   The price of such pleasure is expected to be $8,000 to $10,000
when the system, marketed by Lucasfilm Ltd., makes its debut this
fall.
   More relevant, perhaps to the average filmmaker, is the
ultra-compact camcorder, with Sony offering what it bills as the
world's smallest in its Handycam CCD-TR4, a 4&rsqb;-by-4&lsqb;-by-6|-inch unit
that weighs 1{ pounds.
   The device, with a suggested retail price of $1,100, uses
8-millimeter tape in a cassette about the size of a standard audio
cassette and is aimed at the most active on-the-go user, said
company spokesman Yuki Nozoe.
   Close on Sony's heels in camcorder ultracompactness is Panasonic
with its Palmcorder PV-10, which uses compact VHS tapes and has a
suggested retail price of $999.
   Also reaching new frontiers in getting a lot of information into
a very small space is Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc., which is
introducing the world's first hand-held electronic encyclopedia.
   The 5{-by-5-by-1-inch unit weighing 12 ounces affords a user
access to any entry in the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia by punching
words into a small keyboard, according to its Mount Holly,
N.J.-based manufacturer. The unit has a suggested retail price of
$299.
   The electronics show, which runs through Tuesday and is closed to
the public, is sponsored by the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer
Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries Association.
   An estimated 55,000 visitors, mostly retailers or their
representatives, are expected to attend the event, a semi-annual
gathering whose twin is held each January in Las Vegas.
   Consumer electronics manufacturers expect to ring up $33.97
billion in factory sales this year, compared with $32.26 billion
last year, Industry Vice President Frank Myers said in a speech at
the show's opening.

<HEAD>Late Spring Storm Sends Heavy Winds, Rains Over Central U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An unseasonably strong storm raced across the central United
States Saturday, dumping heavy rains and spinning off high winds
over Iowa and Minnesota.
   Thunderstorms boomed from Minnesota through the Mississippi
Valley into northeast Texas.
   Minnesota and Iowa had the worst storms. Gusts of up to 80 mph
were clocked at Estherville in northwest Iowa, and 67 mph in Des
Moines in the central part of the state. High winds downed trees and
power lines in Marshalltown, about 50 mph northeast of Des Moines.
   In Minnesota, Minnetonka got nearly an inch of rain in just 15
minutes and Saint Cloud got 1.5 inches in the six-hour period ending
at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Gusts up to 60 mph were reported in central Kansas. High winds
around Hutchinson, 40 miles northwest of Wichita, overturned trucks,
blew off roofs and felled trees and power lines. Nearly 24,000
people in Hutchinson and surrounding Reno County were without power
during the four-hour storm, but electricity was restored by late
afternoon.
   A tornado watch was in effect until evening in parts of
east-central and southeast Minnesota, most of Wisconsin, northeast
Illinois, and central and eastern Iowa.
   Thunderstorms also extended from western into northeast Texas.
Tornado watches were issued for most of Arkansas, northeast Texas,
and northwest Louisiana.
   Scattered rain fell from North Dakota to eastern Nebraska, and
over the upper Ohio Valley. Showers were more widely scattered from
South Carolina to southern Florida.
   Sunny skies prevailed across the southwest corner of the nation.
   High-wind warnings were in effect for the southeastern mountains
of Wyoming, where winds reached 75 mph near Granite Reservoir west
of Cheyenne.
   The temperature dipped to 35 degrees in Grand Junction, Colo.,
breaking the record low for the date of 38 set in 1954.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 19 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.

<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
may be languishing in a Minnesota prison cell, but campaign
contributions for his Virginia congressional drive rolled in anyway.
   LaRouche, who is serving a 15-prison sentence for tax evasion,
mail fraud and conspiracy in a $25 million fund-raising scheme,
raised more than $200,000, records show.
   The ultraconservative activist is running as an independent
against Republican Rep. Frank R. Wolf for the 10th district seat.
   According to records filed with the Federal Election Commission,
the ``LaRouche for Justice'' campaign raised $221,318 between July
1, 1989, and March 31, 1990.
   LaRouche's records show that as of March 31 he had spent all but
about $8,000.
   LaRouche and several associates were convicted last year of
defrauding dozens of people who responded to fund-raising appeals
for his political network.
   Prosecutors argued that LaRouche and his followers persuaded many
people to make ``loans'' to LaRouche organizations with no intention
of paying back the money.
   Many of those who lost money to LaRouche were retirees, and some
are now seeking to recover part of their losses in court. FEC
records show that a sizable number of the donors to LaRouche's
congressional campaign are retirees.
   LaRouche is a former resident of Loudoun County, which along with
Arlington County, northern Fairfax County, Falls Church and Fairfax
City comprises Virginia's 10th District.
   Under federal law, LaRouche cannot vote because he is a convicted
felon. But the law allows him to run for office and does not require
that he live in the district he hopes to represent.
   LaRouche is at a federal prison in Rochester, Minn.

<HEAD>Pilot Arrested on Drunken Driving Charge En Route to Flight,
Newspaper Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines pilot was suspended
from flying after his arrest on a drunken-driving charge as he drove
to work, according to a published report Saturday.
   ``He was on his way, yes, to fly a regular passenger flight,''
Northwest spokesman Doug Miller told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press.
   Hans Falkenberg, 39, of Prescott, Wis., was arrested on Memorial
Day, and has been suspended from flying, the newspaper reported.
   Shortly after his arrest, Falkenberg ``asked to make a phone call
so he could call his employer and cancel a flight,'' said Minnesota
Patrol Capt. Dean Swanson.
   On March 8, a Northwest cockpit crew was arrested after flying a
commercial jet from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis. The three crew
members face federal charges of flying while under the influence of
alcohol; all have pleaded innocent. The Federal Aviation
Administration revoked their pilot licenses and the airline fired
them.
   Falkenberg was stopped by a state trooper for driving an average
of 73 mph in a 55-mph zone on a state highway in Cottage Grove on
Monday afternoon, Swanson said. According to his arrest report, the
trooper smelled alcohol on Falkenberg, then asked him to perform a
series of coordination tests.
   ``That led to his arrest,'' Swanson said.
   After refusing to submit to a blood-alcohol or urine test,
Falkenberg was booked into a county jail. He was given a misdemeanor
citation for driving under the influence of alcohol and released
that evening, the newspaper reported.
   He is scheduled to appear in court June 21.
   Northwest officials would not discuss any other details of the
incident pending the outcome of their own investigation.
   The airline did not release the pilot's name, would not say
whether he is a captain or co-pilot and would not comment on whether
the flight was delayed or where it was bound.
   Falkenberg could not be reached for comment at home Saturday. His
wife said he would have no comment, and refused to say whether he
had an attorney.

<HEAD>Abandoning Policy Of Silence, France Announces A Nuclear Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France announced that it
detonated a nuclear device Saturday at its testing site in the South
Pacific, the first time in 15 years it had made such a public
declaration.
   Since 1975, France had maintained a policy of official silence on
its tests at the atoll of Mururoa. Customarily, the world first
learned of the tests from New Zealand, which has monitored France's
nuclear program from an observation station in the Cook Islands.
   The new policy of public disclosure was announced by President
Francois Mitterrand during a visit to French Polynesia in May.
   It was the latest of several steps taken by the government to
defuse criticism of its testing program. Another initiative has
involved inviting foreign researchers to visit Mururoa to test
France's claims that there has been no severe environmental damage.
   France's high commissioner in French Polynesia, Jean Montpezat,
said the undergound test was carried out Saturday morning with a
device unleashing about 15 kilotons of energy, equivalent to the
U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
   Premier Michel Rocard recently announced France would reduce the
number of nuclear tests at Mururoa from eight to six a year.

   In Russian Monopoly, rubles replace greenbacks
and a Moscow shopping mall stands in for the coveted Boardwalk, so
the game's maker sees a visit from the ultimate Soviet bigwig as a
natural promotional peg.
   Hoping to distribute the game throughout the Soviet Union, Tonka
Corp. decorated 1,000 copies of the Russian games with a special
seal to commemorate Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to
Minnesota.
   The games are being distributed by the Minnetonka-based firm to
visiting Soviet dignitaries and members of the Soviet news media in
anticipation of Gorbachev's arrival Sunday.
   Tonka's Parker Brothers subsidiary developed the Russian version
of the game and printed 10,000 copies two years ago to help promote
the 1988 World Monopoly Tournament in London, said company spokesman
B.J. French said.
   ``Part of what's fun about this is that Monopoly is part of the
ultimate capitalist thing,'' French said. ``It's part of Americana.''
   The commemorative editions with the seal showing the U.S. and
Soviet flags superimposed on the state of Minnesota aren't for sale,
but Russian Monopoly is available at specialty game stores in the
United States, French said.
   ``We're proud of the fact that Gorbachev is coming to Minnesota
and since we have our roots here too, we want to be part of the
celebration,'' French said. ``This game is helping us to do that.''
   And that's just the beginning.
   ``We would like to establish the game in the Soviet market,''
said Patricia McGovern, spokeswoman for Parker Brothers, which is
based in Beverly, Mass. ``We need a company in the Soviet world that
would be interested in publishing and distributing the game there.''
   The Russian version of Monopoly is available in the Soviet Union
only in duty-free and hard currency shops where rubles have no
buying power, Ms. McGovern said.
   In addition to the 10,000 Russian games manufactured by Parker, a
French company produces the games for sale in Europe.
   ``Most of the people who buy the Russian Monopoly in Finland are
Soviet diplomats,'' she said. ``I have received quite a few letters
from people in the Soviet world that have it and absolutely love
it.''
   The Russian version of Monopoly is Parker Brother's 23rd foreign
edition. The games are distributed in more than 30 countries
worldwide, Ms. McGovern said.
   In its Russian form, the Monopoly board was altered to reflect
Moscow's cityscape, with Boardwalk becoming Arbat, the mall where
President Reagan walked with Gorbachev during the 1989 summit.
   Rubles replace American dollars and all references to stocks were
changed to bonds becauses stocks do not exist in the Soviet Union.
   The Community Chest card in the American version that refers to a
Christmas Club was changed to ``lottery'' in the Russian game
because there are no official holidays with religious connotations
in the Soviet Union.

   Actress Judy Carne has agreed to plead guilty
to contempt of court to settle an 11-year-old case, according to her
lawyer.
   Ms. Carne, known for her role as the ``Sock-it-to-me'' girl in
the 1960s television series ``Laugh-In,'' failed to appear in 1979
for retrial on a charge of using a forged prescription to get
sleeping pills. She was arrested May 19 in New York on an
11-year-old warrant in the case.
   Her lawyer, Philip Pitzer, said she has reached a plea agreement
with Hamilton County prosecutors. She plans to appear in Common
Pleas Court next Tuesday to plead guilty to contempt.
   ``In exchange ... the prosecution will dismiss that remaining
count,'' Pitzer said. ``I think they're going to recommend the
maximum fine, which is $500.''
   Ms. Carne was arrested in 1977 while appearing at a local dinner
theater. She was charged with using a forged prescription to buy
sleeping pills and possession of heroin.
   A jury found her innocent of the heroin charge, but couldn't
reach a verdict on the prescription forgery charge. She was
scheduled to be tried again before Common Pleas Judge Thomas Crush,
the same judge scheduled to hear her case Tuesday.
   County prosecutors have declined to comment on the case.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela announced
Saturday he had a benign cyst removed from his bladder but expected
to leave this week on a 13-nation tour to fight apartheid.
   His news conference came after five days of speculation on his
true condition. Officials at the Park Lane Clinic in Johannesburg
had said he underwent a minor operation there on Monday, but they
refused to provide any details.
   ``He is a very fit young man for his age,'' said the 71-year-old
black leader's doctor, Gus Gecelter, on Saturday.
   The African National Congress leader was admitted to the clinic
May 27 for what ANC officials described as a routine physical
examination. Aside from the announcement he had undergone a minor
operation Monday, no other details were provided until Saturday by
doctors, his family, or ANC representatives.
   Mandela, though looking at bit tired at the news conference that
day, ``I feel on top of the world, and I'm looking forward to the
trip with eagerness.''
   Gecelter, Mandela's doctor since 1985, confirmed at the news
conference the cyst on Mandela's bladder was benign.
   He said Mandela ``had no problems before or after the operation.''
   Mandela said he was eager to begin his six-week, 13-nation tour
to tell the world no significant changes have been made in South
Africa's apartheid system of racial separation.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who freed Mandela from prison in
February and launched other reforms, has been arguing that other
nations should lift sanctions on South Africa because of the changes
it is making.
   Mandela had been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government. His ANC is
the leading group fighting apartheid.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo suffered a stroke late last year.
Though Mandela is deputy president of the ANC, many people have
viewed him in recent months as the group's de facto leader.
   Mandela was expected to leave the clinic this weekend and spend
at least one night at his home in the Soweto township outside
Johannesburg before he begins his tour Monday with a stop in
Botswana.
   He will then visit the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and
Mozambique.
   At his news conference, Mandela described the government's
proposal last week to scrap the Separate Amenities Act, which
racially segregates public facilities, as ``quite insignificant.''
   ``It is not the real issue over which we are fighting. The basic
issue in this country is whether blacks are going to have the right
of self-determination,'' he said.
   De Klerk has initiated talks with the ANC and other black groups
to give the black majority a political role. However, he has not
said he would accept majority rule.

<HEAD>German Anxiety Over Reunified Germany Grounded in Memories of War</HEAD>

comment Saturday by President Bush's chief spokesman.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's fear of a reunified Germany
is grounded in a bitter national memory of millions lost in war and
a sober recognition that a historical enemy's rise might parallel
its own decline.
   The roster of Russian dead in World War II _ 7.5 million by
unofficial estimates _ dwarfs the losses of other nations and is
roughly 18 times higher that of America, which was spared combat on
its home soil. Millions of Soviet civilians also perished as German
forces penetrated deeply into Russian territory.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a top adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, said Saturday that the lingering fear of Germany _ not
the Soviet economy _ was paramount in the minds of Soviets.
   ``Whenever our children play war,'' he said, ``the two opposing
sides to this day are the Soviets and the Nazis _ the Germans.''
   Despite all the years of tension between the United States and
the Soviet Union, Soviet children playing such games have never
posed as Americans, he said.
   ``You can judge from that how deep are the fears of Germany's
military might. ... Our people have survived two wars started by the
Germans in this century.''
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, with Gorbachev at his
side, told reporters in Ottawa last week: ``All of the nations
suffered greatly in the Second World War, but none _ none suffered
more dramatically than the Soviet Union.''
   Said former NATO Ambassador Robert F. Ellsworth: ``Today, the
Germany question is completely different from what it has been
before, because it is the Russians that are weak and uncertain.''
   So the German issue, unsurprisingly, hovered over Gorbachev's
talks with Mulroney, and loomed menacingly as a possible albatross
around the necks of Gorbachev and President Bush, his summit host.
Indeed, the summit's risk of failure may have been averted by their
acknowledgements at the outset that the German question couldn't be
resolved in four days of talks here.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, briefing reporters on the
pair's talks Saturday at Camp David, Md., said that both Bush and
Gorbachev felt their Germany discussions ``were quite productive''
in the sense that the superpower leaders ``did reach a better
understanding of their positions.''
   Germany was divided into Eastern and Western zones after World
War II, but the Western powers remained committed to its eventual
reunification despite the puppet East German government set up by
the Soviet Union.
   Germany's omnipresence as an issue at East-West summits is richly
documented.
   When President Harry Truman and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin met
with British leaders in Potsdam in 1945, it was, in part, to carve
up the Germany that the Allies had just conquered.
   By 1959, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev met with President
Dwight D. Eisenhower, trouble was brewing over the Potsdam
agreement. Khrushchev was proposing to terminate allied rights in
West Berlin, posing the threat of a major East-West confrontation.
   But in subsequent superpower talks, the German issue receded into
the background as arms control questions came to fore. That is,
until last year's toppling of the communist government of East
Germany in the wave of democratic reform that swept through central
and eastern Europe.
   West German armed forces number about 494,000. East German forces
totaled about 173,000 last year, although they may have been cut
some since, and it is unclear how many of them might be absorbed
into the unified German military force.
   Against this background, and with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
disintegrating, Bush made it clear last week that he favors a united
Germany as a full member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance. The Soviets
balked, and Gorbachev exhorted the West to find ``a new melody.''
   Georgi Arbatov, director of the Soviet Institute for U.S. and
Canada Studies, said that ``a military alliance against the Soviet
Union, that's the way we see NATO.''
   In his meeting with Bush, Gorbachev proposed that the military
role of a united Germany be decided by a new ``council of all
Europe'' in which both the United States and the Soviet Union would
participate. Diplomatic aides are to pursue the idea in Copenhagen,
Denmark, this week and in Berlin two weeks later.
   Ellsworth, the former NATO ambassador who now is vice chairman of
the private American Council on Germany, predicted the issue could
still remain a thorny one for the United States and the Soviets.
   ``Russians are saying, `We have the memory of these fears left
over from World War II.' '' said Ellsworth. ``It's totally
understandable, but I just don't think that we in the West can
conduct our politics on the basis of providing psychiatric therapy
for the Russians' neurotic memories of World War II, valid as they
are.''
   ``When the Germans get unified, they are going to have to make
these decisions as a sovereign people or otherwise it won't work,''
he said. ``They will have to be part of the picture, but not in
their present legal status as the defeated power in World War II.''

<HEAD>Leader of Rival Union Attacks Economic Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Solidarity's rival trade
union on Saturday attacked the government's economic plan for
creating unemployment and appealed for a social security plan to
protect workers.
   Alfred Miodowicz, leader of the OPZZ trade union alliance that
communist authorities formed in 1984, told delegates at the union's
second national congress that the country needed to prepare for a
five-year battle for the ``existence of Poles.''
   OPZZ claims 6.5 million members and the congress is being held in
Warsaw to discuss the Solidarity-led government's plan to introduce
a free market economy.
   The dismantling of the centrally planned economy threatens jobs
in inefficient state-run industries and public service sectors where
many OPZZ members work.
   The government's radical reform plan, designed by Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and introduced Jan. 1, has cut subsidies
to major enterprises, lifted price controls and maintained a tight
wage policy. Over 400,000 people are officially receiving
unemployment benefits.
   ``Balcerowicz's plan is faulty because it assumes a reduction of
jobs _ unemployment _ from the very start,'' Miodowicz told the
delegates.
   He also stressed the need for ``social justice'' in the economy.
   OPZZ was formed while Solidarity was still illegal and has never
enjoyed the prestige of Solidarity. OPZZ was humiliated last week
when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa managed to end an OPZZ-backed
strike by railway workers that disrupted train service for a week.
   Also Saturday, the congress re-elected Miodowicz as chairman.

<TEXT>
   True, there were some 11th-hour
negotiations. But the seeds of President Bush's decision to grant
trade concessions to the Soviet Union were sown in his renewal of
trade benefits for the Chinese and his refusal to impose sanctions
against Moscow over Lithuania.
   Bush's action meant that for the second time in as many weeks, he
was ignoring widespread congressional opposition to a trade
agreement with a regime whose human rights policies have been
sharply criticized.
   Bush's earlier renewal of trade benefits to China and his
decision not to slap economic sanctions on Moscow over its hardline
approach in the Baltic states made it harder for him to say no to an
anxious Gorbachev, some aides are suggesting.
   If Bush won any private assurances from Gorbachev on Lithuania in
exchange for the trade deal, neither side was letting on.
   U.S. officials insisted that Bush did not extract any such
commitment from Gorbachev; and Soviet officials continue to
characterize the stalemate as an internal dispute that they will
resolve themselves.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, briefing reporters
Saturday on Bush's talks with Gorbachev at the Maryland presidential
retreat, was asked what the United States got in return for signing
the trade pact.
   ``Well, we got out of it ... what we put into at Malta (summit),
which was the recognition that, as the superpower and leader of the
Western alliance, that we are leading the way to help the Soviet
Union integrate itself into the international economic community.''
   ``Certainly signing the trade agreement, from our point of view,
is a symbol and a way to encourage further development, to try to
help out with that process of economic reform,'' he said.
   U.S. sources said that, even though Soviet officials balked at
the last minute at signing a grain deal, Bush's mind was not made up
by this last minute Soviet attempt at haggling.
   Instead, Gorbachev's fervent, direct appeal for the agreement and
Bush's desire to help strengthen the hand of the embattled Soviet
leader at home had more bearing on his decision, the officials said.
   Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said it was clear that
Gorbachev ``wanted some give on the trade side ... I think he feels
that if he doesn't get it he's going home empty-handed.''
   The Soviet leader himself made it clear in his comments to
congressional leaders on Friday at the Soviet Embassy that he sorely
wanted the trade pact.
   And, in fact, Gorbachev himself raised the specter of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown in noting that the United States had
extended its most-favored-nation trade hand to Beijing _ but not to
Moscow.
   Gorbachev pressed the same points in meetings with Bush both on
Thursday and on Friday, said an administration official. At one
point, Bush even expressed frustration that the Supreme Soviet had
not yet acted on long pending legislation to codify more liberal
emigration policies, sources said.
   The Soviet leader told Bush he would make an even harder effort
to get the law passed, the sources said.
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, a top Gorbachev adviser, told reporters
Saturday that the emigration law is ``on the finishing line.''
   Sources said Gorbachev's forceful pleas, together with Bush's
historical bias against economic sanctions, helped the Soviet leader
win his case.
   As Bush and Gorbachev relaxed at the U.S. presidential retreat
here in the Cactoctin Mountains of Maryland on Saturday, the
divisive trade decision was behind them and they went on to other
issues.
   But the Bush administration still faces a likely battle in
Congress as the president tries to win approval of the new
agreement. A tough battle is also expected on the China move.
   With China, Bush renewed already existing most-favored-nation
status for another year. But the Soviet Union has not had
most-favored-nation status since 1952, when it was revoked by
Congress. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act requires
a country to have both a trade agreement with the United States and
a law allowing free emigration before it can be granted
most-favored-nation status.
   In giving Gorbachev the trade agreement _ the first part of the
equation _ Bush also attached a short string. He told the Soviet
leader he would not even send the measure to Congress for approval
until the Supreme Soviet passes the emigration law.
   However, the strings extended only to emigration policy, not
Lithuania. And the absence of any Soviet concessions on Lithuania is
what is likely to stir the most opposition. The Senate passed a
resolution May 1 urging Bush to hold off granting
most-favored-nation status to the Soviets until they lifted the
blockade against Lithuania.
   Administration officials are backpeddling _ trying to assert that
there never had been a link between trade and Lithuania.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday, ``There has
been no formal linkage by anybody in this administration that I am
aware of'' between the two issues. Baker didn't place it there, but
the emphasis clearly was on the word ``formal'' since before the
summit one official after another had informally linked the trade
pact with progress on two fronts: the Soviet emigration law and
Lithuania.

   Indian Airlines, India's state-owned
carrier, will prohibit smoking on all domestic flights, the company
announced Saturday.
   The company said the ban, which takes effect Wednesday, will not
apply to its flights to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan or
Singapore.
   Indian Airlines, India's biggest domestic airline, already bans
smoking on some flights.
   Air-India, the government-owned international airline, allows
smoking as does Vayudoot, a smaller domestic carrier.

<HEAD>Naked Man Crashes Through Windows, Is Shot Dead in Bizarre Rampage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   A homeowner shot and killed a naked man who
charged through a glass door during a neighborhood rampage, police
said Saturday.
   The man earlier smashed his head or hand through windows at three
other homes late Friday, terrorizing residents but not harming them.
   There was no explanation for the bizarre assault on the San
Fernando Valley neighborhood. Police were awaiting the results of
coroner's tests to determine if the man was on drugs, said Detective
Rick Swanston.
   The dead man was identified as Gene Brian Hollaway, 23, who lived
about a mile away from the neighborhood where he was killed and did
not know any of the people who were terrorized, Swanston said.
   ``We are looking at it as a justifiable homicide,'' he said.
   Hollaway had been unemployed for about a year since being
discharged from the Army.
   The rampage ended when homeowner James Bruner, 38, shot Hollaway
as he reportedly advanced toward Bruner's wife, Elizabeth, after
breaking into their house.
   Police were called to the Bruner home about 11 p.m. Bruner, 38,
told police he was at home with his wife and child when he heard a
noise in the back yard, went outside and was confronted by a
blood-covered naked man.
   They struggled until Bruner got back inside his house and locked
a sliding glass door behind him. He told his wife to call police and
armed himself with a shotgun.
   Hollaway then threw his body through the glass door and Bruner
fired twice as Hollaway moved threateningly toward Mrs. Bruner,
Swanston said.
   Simultaneously, three break-ins were reported nearby.
   Residents said an intruder shoved his head through a closed
bathroom window at one house and began yelling, the detective said.
   The man smashed a fist through a window in the front door of a
second house, unlocked the door, confronted a woman, entered her
bedroom, then threw himself out a front window.
   A bedroom window was smashed at a third house but Hollaway did
not enter. Instead he went into the back yard and disrobed before
proceeding to the Bruner house.
   Bruner was questioned, but was not arrested.

   Police clashed with rioting music fans
who tore down fences to see a concert by a British reggae band, news
reports said Saturday. One man was reported killed, and 39 people
were injured.
   The violence broke out when angry fans outside a stadium in the
eastern town of Mutare late Friday ripped the fences down to enter
the concert by the group Misty In Roots, the semi-official Zimbabwe
Inter African News Agency reported.
   The rioters then overturned a car and set it on fire, the agency
said.
   The report quoted a police spokeswoman, Judith Nqwababa, as
saying police fired warning shots after rioters also tried to set
fire to a gasoline station near the stadium.
   The news agency said police also shot tear gas to break up the
crowd.
   ``Somebody in the crowd fired back with a shotgun, disemboweling
a man nearby,'' Nqwababa was quoted as saying.
   Of the injured, 38 were music fans and one was a handler of
police dogs.
   About 18 fans were arrested, the news agency said.
   Misty In Roots has been touring this southern African country for
about two weeks to help raise funds for handicapped and orphaned
children.

   The bodies of the women keep turning up. Two in
one weekend. Nine over the past 14 months.
   Eight were white. Seven were known prostitutes.
   Three young women were suffocated within five days of each other
last week, their bodies found in suburban Virginia.
   Every new murder renews the question: Is there a serial killer on
the loose targeting prostitutes who work several blocks from the
White House?
   The police aren't talking.
   ``We're looking at all the possibilities,'' said Mike Rocconi, an
Arlington County (Va.) police spokesman, echoing statements by other
police departments.
   ``I don't believe they are at the point where they are going to
say they are all related,'' said Lucy Caldwell, a Virginia State
Police spokeswoman.
   But the women who walk the streets once frequented by at least
seven of the victims know that someone is killing white, blond
prostitutes. They say they are taking precautions, even though two
local police officers who knew all the dead women say business seems
to be proceeding as usual.
   ``I'm having the guys follow me in a taxi,'' said one blond,
self-described ``whore,'' identifying herself only as Susan. ``I
quit working at night.''
   Marie, a 22-year-old brunette with a 3-year-old baby to support,
said she no longer gets into a customer's car, but she recognizes
such precautions may be useless.
   ``If he's a serial killer, nothing's going to help us,'' said
Marie, dressed like a college coed out for a jog. ``A couple of the
girls he's gotten so far were fighters. ... He must have some sort
of scars on him, because at least two of them wouldn't have given up
their lives without a fight.''
   The nine cases have similarities and differences:
   _Seven are known prostitutes who worked in the District. The
identities and the occupations of the other two were not yet known.
   _Eight victims were white, including the seven prostitutes. One
was black.
   _The three victims found last week in Virginia _ two in Arlington
over the weekend and one in Alexandria on Wednesday _ were
suffocated. Three other victims were shot in the head. Two were shot
in the chest. One was killed by a blow to the head.
   _Six victims were found in the Virginia suburbs, three in the
District.
   A criminologist said different killing methods and locations
don't necessarily mean several killers are at work.
   ``It might mean he's trying to screw up the cops,'' said Robert
O. Heck, an architect of the FBI's serial killing unit. He stressed
he was discussing such killers in general, not the Washington cases.
   ``Different types of killing is nothing,'' said Heck, who now
works for the Justice Department's juvenile justice office. ``Even
geographics could change vastly with a serial killer. Twenty miles
is nothing to some of them.''
   The many police jurisdictions involved are sharing information,
and they held a meeting Thursday that included the FBI. But no task
force has been formed that would indicate the agencies believe the
slayings are linked.
   Prissy Williams-Godfrey, a self-described madam and spokeswoman
for prostitutes, said she is outraged at what she considers police
inaction.
   ``I never thought I would see white women in America being
treated like this,'' said Williams-Godfrey, who is black. ``They're
being treated that way because of their sexual preference. They
(police) think these women are getting exactly what they deserve.''
   Instead of sending out male decoys to catch female prostitutes,
she said, police should ``put women decoys out to catch the killer.''
   The fact that most of the victims have been prostitutes should
not ease the fears of those who aren't streetwalkers, said Merlyn D.
``Doug'' Moore, a professor at Sam Houston Criminal Justice Center
in Huntsville, Texas.
   ``A prostitute is a more likely candidate just because of the
nature of her business,'' Moore said.
   However, he said, ``The assumption is that the individual who is
killing is only killing prostitutes, and we don't know that. How
many other homicides might there be but we haven't found them yet?''
   Prostitutes know danger comes with the territory.
   ``If you put yourself out here on the street, trying to make
money, what can you expect?'' said Cindy, 25, rubbing a bruise
inflicted by a customer.
   The freckle-faced blonde from Sacramento said prostitution has
paid her bills for 11 years, the last four in Washington. Some
streetwalkers claim to make $1,500 to $2,000 a week here.
   Although she knew seven of the murder victims, she plans to keep
working.
   ``Washington is a good town,'' Cindy said. ``There's a whole
bunch of money here for prostitutes.''
   Police, meanwhile, were trying to determine the identities of two
victims.
   One _ found suffocated Wednesday near an office complex in
Alexandria _ was described as white, under 20, 5-foot-3 to 5-foot-4,
about 130 pounds with brown eyes and brownish-blond hair. She was
wearing a black leather and suede jacket, a turquoise and black top
and black Spandex pants.
   A black woman who was shot five times, several times in the head,
was found May 9 on a curb in Falls Church, Va.
   The seven victims who worked the same Washington corridor,
according to authorities or fellow prostitutes, are:
   _Sandra Rene Johnson, 20, found May 27 in her apartment in the
Country Club Towers in Arlington. She was suffocated.
   _Sherry Kay Larman, 26, of Lanham, Md., found May 26 on the top
level of parking garage on South Highland Street in Arlington. She
was suffocated.
   _Lisa Colleen Grossman, 29, of Fairfax County, Va., found March
18 on South Pickett Street in Alexandria, Va. She died from a blow
to the head.
   _Carolen Marie Wallace, 22, of Forestville, Md., found Feb. 14 in
a Fairfax County storm sewer near I-495. She was shot in the head.
   _Roxanne Lynn Johnson, 23, of Baltimore, found Oct. 1 outside
Ballou High School in southeast Washington. She was shot in the head.
   _Cori Louise Jones, 29, found Aug. 12 on a street in the
Anacostia section of Washington. She was shot in the chest.
   _Mary Ellen Sullenberger, 20, of Lancaster, Pa., found April 2,
1989, near 12th and L streets in northwest Washington. She was shot
in the chest.

   After hours of chaos due to police
protests, former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti won the
endorsement for governor at Saturday's state Democratic convention
and John Silber won a spot in the primary.
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who had predicted she would win the
endorsement, also locked up a spot in September's primary with a
second-place finish. State Rep. John Flood was eliminated.
   Silber, on leave as president of Boston University, qualified for
the primary by a razor-thin margin of 22 votes in the first round of
balloting.
   A police picket outside Springfield Civic Center to protest
decaying police equipment delayed proceedings for more than three
hours when thousands of delegates remained outside to honor the
picket line. Gov. Michael Dukakis' farewell speech was pushed from
early morning into the afternoon.
   Democratic officials finally obtained an injunction to keep the
picket line away from the convention center. Some Democrats accused
the police of playing politics and trying to spoil the event, since
the union supported George Bush in the 1988 presidential election.
   The 5,000 delegates gave Dukakis a standing ovation before and
after his remarks.
   The 1988 Democratic presidential candidate urged the party to
stick by its agenda of affordable housing, environmental protection,
universal health care and job training _ an agenda he set in three
terms as governor.
   ``This is the first statewide election in nearly a quarter of a
century where I won't be with you in your living rooms and at your
plant gates, asking, giving, working and always caring,'' Dukakis
said. ``It's been a long and winding road full of highs and lows,
full of thrills and chills and more than a few spills.''
   ``You are my extended family,'' he told the crowd, some of whom
waved ``proud of Dukakis'' signs.
   On the first ballot, Silber collected 746 votes, or 15.46
percent, from the 4,824 delegates. Fifteen percent was needed to
qualify for the primary.
   ``We were sweating blood,'' said Silber, who promptly withdrew
his name from further balloting, allowing his delegates to move on
to other candidates.
   Flood received 4.5 percent in the first round, Bellotti 42.9
percent and Murphy 37 percent. Bellotti and Murphy were already
assured of making the ballot based on results of party caucuses
earlier this year.
   Under convention rules, balloting continued until a candidate
received more than 50 percent. The low candidate would be dropped
starting with the second ballot.
   In the second round, Bellott won the endorsement with 51 percent
of the 4,613 delegates voting. Murphy received 40 percent and Flood
was eliminated with 8.5 percent.
   Police had been threatening to picket the convention for weeks.
Union President Robert Jacobson said officers have been forced to
use decaying squad cars and other equipment.
   On Friday night, the union and Democratic Party announced a
compromise whereby the police would only conduct an informational
picket if Springfield Mayor Mary Hurley agreed not to address the
convention. But Jacobson claimed Hurley violated the agreement by
entering the convention center Friday night.
   Hurley dismissed the union's charges, saying no agreement existed
for her to stay out of the convention center. She apologized to the
delegates for Saturday's events.
   Still, some Democrats said the police union simply was trying to
embarrass the Democratic Party.
   Some party officials noted that Alexander Tennant, state GOP
executive director, and Ron Kaufman, who headed Bush's Massachusetts
campaign, were both in Springfield for the convention.
   ``I don't know if they instigated it,'' said state Sen. Lois
Pines. ``But I think they're happy about it.''
   Republican Party officials could not be reached for comment, and
Jacobson insisted politics were not involved in the protest.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels armed with a grenade launcher
tried to blow up an armored police vehicle but missed their target
and instead blew up a furniture store in downtown Lima, police said
Saturday.
   The attack sparked a gunfight between the rebels and police and
one bystander was killed and three people wounded, police said.
   On Friday, two guerrillas with the Maoist-inspired Shinning Path
shot to death the manager of a Lima stove manufacturing company as
he was walking near the factory, police said.
   Shining Path guerrillas reportedly have infiltrated the company's
union, which has been on strike since May 3.
   The attempted attack against the police van took place shortly
before midnight Friday.
   At the same hour, explosions rocked two Lima offices of the
center-right Democratic Front coalition, the group backing novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa in the June 10 presidential runoff election.
   Bombs also damaged two offices of the centrist Change 90
political movement, which is supporting frontrunner Alberto Fujimori
in the election.
   Another bomb detonated at the headquarters of President Alan
Garcia's center-left Aprista Party slightly wounding three people,
police said.
   It was unclear which rebel group was responsible for the bombing
and the grenade attack.
   Police said the rebels shot the grenade from a passing car. The
explosion damaged a furniture store and three adjoining businesses,
all of which were closed at the time of the attack.
   Police opened fire at the car, and the rebels shot back with
automatic weapons before speeding off. One man walking in the area
was killed by a stray bullet, and two women were wounded.
   One of the six policemen in the armored vehicle was wounded in
the gunfight, police said.
   Two major guerrilla groups are fighting Peru's elected government.
   The Maoist-oriented Shining Path is the largest and most violent
rebel group. It took up arms in 1980 and now controls large parts of
the central highlands and northern jungle.
   The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement started fighting
the government in 1984. It often launches night attacks in Lima.
   The government says more than 18,500 people have died since the
groups began their fight.
   Also on Saturday, police said a light airplane with four
Peruvians aboard disappeared in a rugged area of the southern Andes
Mountains after experiencing mechanical problems.
   The plane departed Friday morning from Cuzco bound for Ayacucho,
a 45-minute flight over a Andes. The pilot reported mechanical
difficulties 30 minutes after takeoff and radio contact with the
plane was lost shortly thereafter.

   A jury awarded $28.7 million to a 5-year-old boy,
who contracted AIDS through an unauthorized blood transfusion, and
his parents in what his attorney believes is the largest award of
its kind.
   The Maricopa County Jury on Friday awarded $26.7 million to Alex
Edwards and $1 million to each of his parents, Roy and Pat Edwards.
   The jury on May 23 found Dr. Abraham Kuruvilla and the
Neonatology Associates Ltd. liable for Alex's AIDS infection through
the unauthorized transfusion shortly after the boy's birth in 1985.
   Duane Olson, the Phoenix attorney representing Kuruvilla and the
clinic, said he would file an appeal immediately. Olson said the
award was ``worse than I ever could have dreamed.''
   Alex can neither walk nor talk and needs 24-hour care due to
damage to his nervous system from the disease.
   Jurors said they didn't know how how long the boy would live but
that they wanted to make sure he had enough to provide for his needs.
   ``What's going to happen if he lives to be 30 or 40?'' asked jury
foreman Ray Howell. Alex's parents ``won't have the money to care
for him,'' he said.
   ``We're just real happy and pleased that the jury worked together
and came up with a reasonable sum,'' Roy Edwards told reporters.
   The boy, dressed in blue jeans and a yellow T-shirt, was cuddled
by his mother as jurors announced their decision. Holding her son on
her lap, she sometimes kissed his forehead and stroked his blond
hair.
   Kuruvilla was not present.
   Judge David R. Cole had dismissed two other defendants _ Blood
Systems Inc., the parent company of the firm that provided the
blood, and Samaritan Health Services, which runs the hospital where
the transfusion was administered _ after a settlement was reached in
February.
   Alex was born suffering from severe respiratory problems due to
fluid in the lungs when he was transferred to Good Samaritan
Hospital, where Kuruvilla ordered the transfusion. That corrected
the fluid-related problems, Olson said during the trial.
   Olson argued that Mrs. Edwards signed a consent form allowing
doctors to treat her son as they saw fit.
   But the Edwards' attorney, R. Douglas Dalton, argued that not
enough was known about the risk of AIDS by transfusion and that
Kuruvilla should have received consent from the boy's parents for
the procedure.
   The boy's father testified that the couple expressed concerns
about AIDS and offered to donate their own blood when the boy was
given a previous transfusion.
   The boy tested positive for the AIDS virus in 1987.
   Dalton said the largest previous jury award he was aware of for
an AIDS-related case was $12 million awarded March 8 in Columbus,
Ohio, to an 8-year-old girl who received the AIDS virus in a 1985
blood transfusion.

<HEAD>IPI Expresses Concern for Journalists in Turkey and Nigeria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute has protested to
the leaders of Turkey and Nigeria over the imprisonment of several
journalists in the two countries.
   In a letter to Turkish President Turgut Ozal, IPI director Peter
Galliner said the institute was concerned about five imprisoned
journalists on a hunger strike. Galliner said the prisoners are
protesting two articles of the Turkish Criminal Code which, IPI
said, restrict freedom of speech in Turkey.
   ``We believe that the imprisonment of these five journalists is a
gross violation of their basic human and professional rights and we
ask that they be released without delay,'' said the message, sent
Friday.
   Galliner said the journalists involved in the hunger strike were:
Erhan Tuskan, editor of Ilerici Yurtsever Genclik, Hasan Fikret
Ulusoydan, editor of Halkin Sesi, Kazim Arli, editor of Kurtulus
Sosyalist Dergi, Irfan Asik, editor of Partizan and Mehmet Ozgen,
editor of Bagimiz Turkiye and Devrimci Militan.
   In another letter sent Friday, the institute protested to
Nigerian Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, over the imprisonment of three
journalists and the reported closure of four newspapers in that
country.
   The journalists were arrested after the April 22 coup attempt
because their reports on the coup offended President Babangida and
his military government.
   The IPI called on the Nigerian government to release immediately
Chris Mamah from The Punch, Banji Ogundele from the Sunday News and
Tolu Olanrewaju from the Federal Radio Corp. of Nigeria.
   ``We further request that The Punch, Lagos News, Evening News and
Sunday News be reopened without delay and that the media in Nigeria
be allowed to pursue their profession without further harassment,''
said the message sent by Galliner.
   The independent institute, with offices in London and Zurich,
claims representation of leading publishers and editors in more than
60 countries.
   Also Friday, the Nigerian Civil Liberties Organization filed suit
to block the two-week-old trial of 10 military officers accused of
leading a failed coup attempt against the government.
   The Civil Liberties Organization, the country's most prominent
human rights' group, also seeks to block the pending trial of five
civilians by the same military tribunal.
   The organization filed suit Friday asking a state court to rule
that the military tribunal cannot be impartial because the officers
sitting on it were targets of the coup plotters.
   It also said the military will not permit the defendants to have
civilian lawyers. No date has been set for a judgment on the suit.

<HEAD>Sephardic Jews Win Prince Of Asturias Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVIEDO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's Sephardidic Jewish communities,
scattered by their expulsion from Spain almost 500 years ago, have
received the 1990 Prince of Asturias Cooperation Prize.
   The prize is awarded annually to a person, group or insititution
that makes an outstanding contribution to peace, solidarity or
progress among men or to the struggle against poverty, illness or
ignorance or to the protection of world heritage.
   Asturias regional government head Pedro de Silva, who led the
prize jury, praised the Sephardi for their conservation of their
links to Spain over the centuries.
   ``Far from their homeland, Sephardic Jews converted themselves
into an itinerant Spain, and with incomparable fervor conserved the
cultural and linguistic legacy of their ancestors,'' de Silva said
in announcing the award Friday.
   ``This prize seeks to contribute to an already initiated process
of restoring harmony after five centuries of separation. We call on
them to to reinforce their links to their land of origin and we
throw open the doors of their ancient country to them,'' de Silva
said, reading the jury citation.
   ``The Sephardic Jews form a deeply beloved part of the great
Hispanic family,'' de Silva added.
   The prize consists of $48,000 and a sculpture by Spanish artist
Joan Miro. The foundation giving the award is named for the heir to
the Spanish throne.
   An estimated 2.5 million of the world's 16 million Jews are
Sephardic _ descendents of the estimated 250,000 Jews who fled Spain
in 1492 after Queen Isabella offered them an alternative of
converting to Cristianity, leaving the country or being killed at
the hands of the Inquisition.
   Most moved to North Africa, Italy, and the Middle East. Today
many live in Europe, South America and the United States.
   Some 60 percent of Jews in Israel are Sephardi.
   Sepharad is the Hebrew name for Spain.
   The Sephardic communities have maintained many of the customs,
traditions and the old Castillian language, known as Ladino, of
their ancestors.
   Spain's Sepharad '92, the country's planned commemoration of the
1492 expulsion of the Jews, will promote numerous cultural
activities aimed at enlightening Spaniards about the largely
forgotten role of Jews in the development of Spanish culture.

<TEXT>
   The Conservative Party nominated New York
University professor Herbert London for governor Saturday while the
Liberal Party chose incumbent Democrat Mario Cuomo.
   The minor parties met in Manhattan to make their choices, which
can be important in close elections, although neither has been a
deciding factor in recent races.
   The anti-abortion Right-to-Life Party is to hold its convention
Sunday in Albany.
   The Liberal Party, which feuded with Cuomo last year over its
endorsement of Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the New York mayoral
race, chose Cuomo unanimously, said party spokesman Carl Grillo.
   The Liberals also nominated Democratic Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine and
Democratic state Attorney General Robert Abrams for re-election.
   Meanwhile, the Conservatives, traditional allies of the
Republicans in recent statewide races, altered history a bit by
nominating London for governor.
   ``London is the only clear alternative to Cuomo,'' said party
spokesman Michael Long, spokesman for the party.
   The Republicans last week chose political neophyte Pierre Rinfret
as their Cuomo challenger. The Canadian-born economist favors
abortion rights, a major factor in his rejection by Conservative
Party leaders. London, 51, is anti-abortion.
   The split between Republicans and Conservatives is expected to
ease Cuomo's re-election bid.
   Cuomo is to be nominated Monday at the Democratic state
convention for re-election to a third four-year term.
   The Conservatives nominated Anthony DiPerna, a retired school
administrator and Conservative Party official from Suffolk County on
Long Island, for lieutenant governor. Bernard Smith, the GOP
candidate for attorney general, won Conservative support.
   New York state has 8.13 million eligible voters. Of those, 3.88
million are enrolled as Democrats; 2.6 million as Republicans;
112,786 as Conservatives; 59,176 as Liberals; and 24,204 as members
of the Right-to-Life Party.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Welcomes Iranian Pilgrims, But Bars Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday that
Iranians are welcome to take part in this year's Islamic pilgrimage
to Mecca but they would not be allowed to demonstrate.
   Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic ties with Iran in April 1988
after Iranian pilgrims clashed with this kingdom's police during the
preceding year's pilgrimage. The battles killed 402 people, mostly
Iranians.
   The Iranians boycotted the 1988 and 1989 pilgrimages, and some
Iranian officials have said they were boycotting the 1990 season.
   Iran has also claimed Saudi officials were preventing Iranians
from taking part this year.
   However, Saudi Arabian authorities stressed Saturday they are
welcoming Iranians to this year's pilgrimage, known as the hajj.
   The official Saudi Arabian Press Agency quoted an unidentified
government spokesman as saying the country ``still welcomes the
Iranian pilgrims to perform the Hajj rites and will present them
with all facilities it accords to their brethren from around the
Moslem world, provided they abide fully by the correct rules and
conduct of the Hajj. ...''
   But, the source was quoted as saying, the kingdom ``cannot show
any leniency in any matter that undermines Islamic Sharia (law) or
infringes on security, such as holding of rallies and staging of
demonstrations. ...''
   The agency also quoted the source as saying he regrets Iran's
``continuous rabid campaigns that are escalating day after day in a
desperate attempt to convince the Iranian Moslem people that the
kingdom of Saudi Arabia is preventing the Iranians from performing
the hajj.''
   Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said Saudi officials
even told an Iranian envoy last month that they were prepared to
raise their quota for Iranian pilgrims from 45,000 to 60,000.
   But the envoy apparently insisted on the Iranian right to
demonstrate at the hajj, the diplomats said.
   That visit by Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Ali Besharati of
Iran was the first by an Iranian official since the kingdom ruptured
diplomatic ties with Tehran, accusing Iranian rulers of terrorism
and subversion.
   After their 1979 Islamic revolution, the Iranians had been trying
to mount demonstrations almost annually at the hajj. The clashes at
the 1987 pilgrimage followed a demonstration by some of the 150,000
Iranian visitors that year.
   Nearly all Iranian Moslems are Shiites, a minority sect at odds
for 1,300 years with the majority Sunnis, who include the Saudi
royal family and 85 percent of all Moslems.
   
   The late Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
accused the Saudi Arabians of being unfit as keepers of Islam's holy
sites. About 2 million Moslems from around the world gather for the
annual rites that culminate this year in early July.

<HEAD>Delegates Split on Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR L. SRB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin Republicans rejected an attempt
Saturday to adopt an anti-abortion party platform plank that would
have called for the ``legal protection of all human beings, from
conception on.''
   But a short time later, delegates endorsed a resolution opposing
abortion as a method of birth control or for the mother's
convenience.
   The action by about 1,000 delegates and alternates at the party's
one-day annual convention appeared to disatisfy pro-choice and
anti-abortion delegates alike.
   ``It appears to make us look schizoid,'' said Fred Patz, a
pro-choice delegate from Milwaukee.
   Alan D. Jaberg, a member of the Republicans for Choice, said he
believed Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for governor, would pounce on the issue and
run with it against Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   Thompson, seeking a second four-year term, was not present when
the votes on the platform and resolution were taken. He had said he
planned to take no part in the convention's abortion debate.
   State Party Chairman Michael Grebe said he saw no political
problem emerging from the action of the delegates on the issue.
   ``I think the party platform shows that we're a party with a
diversity of views on abortion and that we are tolerant of those
opinions,'' Grebe said.
   As for the resolution, Grebe said, ``it shows that on the
specific issue a majority of delegates supports a strong pro-life
position.''
   The platform plank says that while Americans have a diversity of
views on abortion, ``Republicans decry the conditions in
contemporary society that have swelled the number of abortions
performed.''
   ``We support the fostering of responsible attitudes toward
sexuality and the promotion of self-esteem,'' it says, calling for
child adoption as an alternative to abortion.
   The plank remained in the platform after delegates rejected
1,698-1,521 a plank that would have declared Republican support for
``legislation that would establish the legal protection for all
human beings from conception on.''
   ``It's disappointing that the party wants to become neutral on
this,'' said Nick Alioto of Milwaukee, sponsor of the rejected
version.
   Thompson has declared his opposition to abortion except in cases
of rape or incest or to save a woman's life.
   Loftus has said he intends to make abortion a key issue in his
bid to unseat Thompson.

<HEAD>Mexican Opposition Cries Foul Play In Special Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>URUAPAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties on Saturday accused the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party of trying to rig a
special mayoral election in the second largest city in politically
volatile Michoacan state.
   The vote in Uruapan was set for Sunday after allegations of fraud
and disputes over the results forced the annulment of balloting on
Dec. 3.
   Such allegations have frequently been made against the governing
party, which has ruled Mexico since the party's formation in 1929.
Party leaders have pledged to end fraud and corruption within the
party.
   Jose Rosario Torres Ramos, local chairman of the opposition
Revolutionary Democratic Party, said he expects the election to
extremely close and it could be decided by a few hundred votes.
   Uruapan, a city of 450,000, was one of more than 20 where the
leftist Revolutionary Democratic Party challenged victories awarded
to the governing party.
   The Revolutionary Democratic Party and the conservative National
Action Party accused the governing party of removing the names of
voters from registration lists and of adding phony names to be used
by people recruited to vote for the party.
   ``People go to pick up the credentials and they aren't there,''
said Juan Antonio Chavez Mendoza, a member of the Revolutionary
Democratic Party. He said the governing party distributed 5,000
voting credentials to party loyalists.
   Luis Donaldo Colosio, national party leader of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, denied the allegation and said his party ``is
confident of an unchallengeable, clear and irrefutable victory.'' He
spoke in Guadalajara, the country's second largest city, on Friday.
   He accused the opposition of resorting to ``violence and
anarchy'' because it has little chance of winning.
   Revolutionary Democratic supporters seized city halls in 21
communities after the Dec. 3 elections to protest the results.
   Army troops using armored vehicles, firing tear gas and spraying
protesters with fire hoses, forced them out four months later. No
injuries were reported. Most of those arrested were released a few
weeks later.

<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old Mexican boy who was minutes away from
a liver transplant died Saturday before surgeons could begin the
operation.
   Sammy Aguirre arrived at Children's Medical Center at 4 a.m., but
his liver was failing, said hospital spokeswoman Sylvia Bodell.
   ``He was immediately put into the intensive care unit ... but
quickly took a turn for the worse,'' Ms. Bodell said.
   The surgery had been scheduled to begin at 1 p.m., but surgeons
determined Sammy would not survive the operation, she said. He died
between 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m.
   Sammy's parents, Rosa Lilia and Armando Aguirre of Buenaventura
in northern Mexico, were by his side when he died, Ms. Bodell said.
   Parents and physicians had been elated but anxious when they
learned Friday that a liver had been found for Sammy, but doctors
said the boy's condition had seriously deteriorated.
   The donated liver came from a Florida child who was slightly
larger and a little older than Sammy, said Sammy's doctor, Dr. Troy
Reyna. The organ was sent to another liver transplant patient, Ms.
Bodell said.
   On Thursday, Sammy was moved to the highest priority for patients
awaiting organ transplants because his liver had failed. The boy
remained in a coma.
   Sammy's ordeal began May 7 when he was admitted to Providence
Memorial Hospital in El Paso, about 120 miles northeast of his
hometown. Because Sammy was from Mexico, he was ineligible for U.S.
programs that could have helped with the operation.
   Reyna launched a media campaign that brought a $150,000 donation
from a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, businessman and additional donations
from the public.

<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They shed their ties, lounged on the patio
and zipped around in a golf cart Saturday, but George and Mikhail
still call each other Mr. President and Mr. President, and probably
always will.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater gave that account of
the boundaries of cordiality as Presidents Bush and Gorbachev held
informal, relaxed talks at the presidential retreat in the Maryland
mountains _ highlighted by some beginner's luck at horseshoes.
   Fitzwater described a halcyon summit day in the countryside that
he said was not for policy decision-making but to ``kind of lean
back and reflect'' on the relationships between their nations. No
first names, though.
   ``They have a very warm and personal relationship but they still
refer to each other as president and I suspect they always will,''
Fitzwater said. ``That's just the nature of the two men.''
   ``They settled into the surroundings by removing ties and seated
themselves around the large patio table which overlooks the
backyard,'' he added.
   The two world leaders leaned back on the terrace and chatted
while overlooking a view of the panoramic countryside, he said.
   Joined by their four closest aides, they enjoyed a ``very casual
and lively give and take,'' he said.
   ``Both presidents seemed quite pleased with the conversations,''
Fitzwater went on. ``Both laughing intermittently at humorous asides
and enjoying the warm Catoctin Mountains sunshine.''
   They then took a tour of the grounds on the retreat, with
Gorbachev at the wheel of one of the Camp David golf carts. They
stopped at various sites around the camp ``including the gym where
both presidents had a brief discussion with marines who were working
out there at the time.''
   After lunch in the camp's Aspen Lodge, the Gorbachevs went for a
stroll around the grounds, and stopped to throw a few horseshoes,
Fitzwater said. Horseshoes is one of Bush's favorite sports and one
in which he delights in engaging his visitors.
   Before leaving, Bush said it was a great day, ``no neckties, very
relaxed.''
   ``The only thing that went wrong is _ I pride myself as a
horseshoe player _ and, President Gorbachev picked up a horseshoe,
never having played the game to my knowledge, and literally,
literally _ all you horseshoe players out there _ threw a ringer the
first time. Really.''
   Bush said Gorbachev explained later over dinner ``that a
horseshoe in the Soviet Union, when posted in one's house,
symbolizes warmth and friendship. And that made an impression on
me.''
   Fitzwater said there were no specific agreements reached by the
presidents _ just lots of ``understanding about feelings, emotions,
where people are coming from and possible avenues for solutions.
.... There's a lot of understanding the two men are getting.''
   ``This afternoon is really an opportunity for them to just lean
back and reflect on how they might help, what their differences are,
what their areas of mutual understandings are.''
   There was even gift-giving to add to the day's apparent idyll.
   Bush gave the Gorbachevs matching navy London Fog, U.S.-made,
windbreaker jackets, with U.S. emblems and their names on them.

<TEXT>
   Rebel troops seeking to topple the
government of President Samuel Doe advanced on the capital Saturday
and appeared to be meeting little resistance from government forces.
   Correspondents who drove the 35 miles from Monrovia to the
airport, where the rebel advance had stalled earlier, said the only
government troops in sight were 20 men manning a roadblock between
the airport and the capital.
   The rebels were seen fanning out, traveling off the roads
straight toward the capital. By avoiding the winding roads and
marching through the bush, the insurgents would cut the distance
from the airport to 25 miles.
   The only significant military presence in the capital was around
Doe's executive mansion, where 2,000 Israeli-trained troops of his
elite Special Anti-Terrorist Unit were stationed.
   No fighting was reported Saturday, and it was not immediately
clear what happened to the remainder of Doe's 5,300-man army.
   A diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the latest
developments could mean that many soldiers had deserted, or that the
fighting had stopped because a deal between Doe and the rebels was
being worked out.
   Hundreds of Doe's mainly untrained, ill-equipped and poorly paid
troops are known to have deserted during the 6-month-old civil war,
according to Liberian military and Western diplomatic sources.
   The government again broadcast orders for troops who had returned
from battle to assemble at the Barclay Training Center, the main
barracks in Monrovia. A similar call last week mustered only 70
soldiers, diplomats said.
   In any case, residents of the city of 500,000 braced for a heavy
battle. Rice, a staple, was in short supply, many market shelves
were empty, power outages were frequent and there had been no
running water for two days.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed since the fighting broke
out in December, most of them civilians slain by government troops.
   Workers were seen topping the walls of the Italian Embassy
compound with barbed wire, while the French Embassy was reinforcing
its iron-grid gates with sheets of heavy metal.
   The rebels _ led by Charles Taylor, the head of the rebel
National Patriotic Front of Liberia _ accuse the Doe administration
of corruption, economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   The rebels claim up to 10,000 people belong to their insurgency.
Diplomats here put the number at about 4,000.
   In a last-ditch effort to end the fighting, Doe said on Friday
that he would not seek re-election in next year's presidental
voting. He asked the United States, which has sent warships toward
the Liberian coast to evacuate U.S. citizens, to help negotiate an
end to the fighting.
   The rebels rejected Doe's concessions but offered their own
terms: If the president leaves the country the rebels would work
with the Liberian government and National Assembly to set up an
interim government.
   Rebel troops already control the country's main port of Buchanan,
60 miles southeast of the capital, and have been advancing from
Buchanan and Kakata, 35 miles to the northeast. Before Saturday's
advance began, the main rebel column had encamped near the
international airport.
   U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were en route from the
Mediterranean to Liberia to evacuate Americans if necessary,
Pentagon sources said. U.S. military officials said 2,100 Marines
were aboard the four ships of the 6th Fleet, which were expected to
arrive off Liberia this weekend.
   ``These units should be in place in the international waters off
Liberia shortly,'' Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Shelley Rogers said
Saturday night.
   U.S. Embassy officials said about 2,000 U.S. citizens, including
110 embassy personnel, and many missionaries and people of Liberian
origin, remain in the country. Last month, there were about 6,000
U.S. citizens in Liberia but most chose to leave as the fighting
worsened.
   The British frigate Andromeda and a tanker arrived off the
Liberian coast Friday to help in any evacuation, said the Ministry
of Defense in London.
   British officials said 220 British citizens remain, plus 88
British passport-holders and 189 citizens for whom the British have
responsibility, including Canadians, Irish, Australians, Malaysians
and Sri Lankans.
   Meanwhile, Church workers erected Red Cross flags outside St.
Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia on Saturday. That signaled
protection for 1,392 refugees registered by the International
Committee for the Red Cross since an assault by government troops on
refugees in a United Nations' compound on Wednesday.
   A U.N. security guard was killed in the attack and about 30 men
and boys were driven away. Most were shot and killed later and their
bodies dumped in the bush, survivors said.
   Descendants of freed U.S. slaves founded Liberia in 1822, and it
became Africa's first independent country in 1847. The West African
nation has a population of 2.5 million.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two square miles of Biscayne Bay remained
polluted with human waste Saturday after raw sewage overflowed a
sewer near the Miami River, sending infectious bacteria into the
water.
   Many of the windsurfers, swimmers and jet skiers that usually
crowd the area of the bay between the MacArthur and Rickenbacker
causeways and Virginia Key, east of Miami's downtown, avoided the
water.
   But not all heeded the message.
   ``I'm just down in Miami for the summer so I have to take
advantage of all the nice weather,'' said water-lover Steve Shapiro.
   Levels of coliform bacteria in the area were up to 13,000 per
milliliter in parts of the bay, 13 times above what is permitted,
according to the Dade County Public Health Unit.
   ``There's bacteria that's in human sewage, and these bacteria are
in the water, and if people ingest it and get it in their bodies, it
could make them sick,'' said the unit's administrator, Walter
Livingstone.
   The health unit has been monitoring the bay since last week's
heavy rains caused an aging sewer pipe near the mouth of the Miami
River to overflow. Officials expected the bacteria to wash out with
the tides within several days.

   Here is a text of a joint statement the
United States and the Soviet Union released Saturday night from the
site of the day's summit talks between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   The U.S. and U.S.S.R. discussed relief requirements and the
prospects for the political solution to Ethiopia's internal
conflict. They welcome the Ethiopian government's agreement to
permit relief food to enter northern Ethiopia through the Port of
Massawa under a U.N.-sponsored relief effort, and they believe that
such operations would not compromise the unity and territorial
integrity of Ethiopia.
   They also welcomed the agreement expressed by the Ethiopian
government to have U.N. representatives present in the course of the
negotiations between the Ethiopian government and the Eritreans.
   In addition, to deal with the growing problems of starvation, the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are prepared to work together and combine
their assets. U.S. food will be transported on Soviet aircraft to
demonstrate our joint commitment to responding to this tragic
humanitarian problem.
   Recognizing the continuing political and military conflicts that
exacerbate the problems of starvation and recognizing also the lack
of momentum on peace talks, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. will support an
international conference of governments under the auspices of the
U.N. on settlement of conflict situations in the Horn of Africa.

   Students on Saturday ended their three-week
occupation of an administration building at the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice over budget cuts and affirmative-action issues.
   But a spokeswoman for the students said the protest was only
partly successful.
   The agreement reached Friday with the City University of New York
board of trustees was an unsatisfying compromise, said Sheena Hazel,
a CUNY senior who helped lead the occupation.
   ``What we really wanted was the resignation of particular
administrators'' demonstrators viewed as racist or hostile to
student interests, Hazel said.
   Under the agreement, the students pledged to vacate the building
in return for several concessions, including amnesty from
disciplinary charges and permission to participate in faculty
searches.
   However, the university reserved the right to press charges for
any vandalism that may have occurred during the protest. John Jay
College is part of the CUNY system.
   College President Gerald W. Lynch also bowed to the students'
demand that a popular professor be recommended for tenure, according
to Steven Young, counsel to the president.
   Young said the teacher, Donald Torrez, will probaly be granted
tenure, although the final decision rests with the CUNY board.
   In an effort to foster understanding, the college will also hold
monthly ``town meetings'' at which people can voice their concerns,
Young said.

<HEAD>U.S. And Soviet Union To Cooperate On Food Airlifts To Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union issued
a joint statement Saturday pledging to save Ethiopians from
starvation by joint food airlifts to the impoverished African nation.
   The statement, issued at the end of day-long summit talks between
Presidents George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, also said the two
countries would support an international conference under U.N.
auspices to bring peace to the Horn of Africa.
   The agreement reflects tangible proof of the growing cooperation
between Soviets and Americans in resolving conflicts in their
spheres of influence around the world.
   The two superpowers cooperated on an agreement that led to
independence for Namibia this year and to the pullout of Cuban
troops from neighboring Angola. Bush and Gorbachev also discussed
possible cooperation on endin civil wars in Afghanistan and
Cambodia, where each supports different sides, but spokesmen said no
formal agreements were reached.
   The need for cooperation is particularly acute in Ethiopia, where
4 million to 5 million people are in danger of hunger as a result of
a prolonged civil war and successive droughts.
   The United States approached the Soviets with the idea of a joint
airlift several months ago.
   To ease the hunger problem, U.S. food will be transported on
Soviet aircraft ``to demonstrate our joint commitment to responding
to this tragic humanitarian problem,'' the communique said.
   The Soviet Union, reeling under domestic economic woes, has
significantly scaled back its economic and military aid to Ethiopia,
prompting President Mengistu Haile Mariam to look elsewhere.
   In an effort to win approval from the West, Mengistu agreed
recently to let relief shipments into the country after suspending
them in a bid to punish rebels in northern Ethiopia.
   The two countries ``welcome the Ethiopian government's agreement
to permit relief food to enter northern Ethiopia through the Port of
Massawa under a U.N.-sponsored relief effort, and they believe that
such operations would not compromise the unity and territorial
integrity of Ethiopia,'' said the joint statement.
   The two sides also hailed Ethiopia's agreement to have U.N.
representatives attend negotiations between the Ethiopian government
and Eritrean rebels seeking independence in one of the continents
longest civil wars.
   An attempt earlier this year by former President Jimmy Carter to
mediate between Ethiopia and the Eritreans failed to yield concrete
results.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,000 people hitched up horses and
hopped onto wagons Saturday for the first leg of a 260-mile trek
along an old settlers' trail to celebrate Wyoming's centennial.
   A fife and drum corps helped kick off the wagon train in Casper
and participants traveled 12 miles before circling up and camping
out for the night.
   Except for a shortage of portable toilets and a rider who was
slightly injured when thrown from a horse, there were no problems,
organizers said.
   ``Things went pretty smoothly for the first day. I'm really
pleased and really proud of everybody,'' said Kayne Pyatt, trail
boss for the 30-day trip on the Jim Bridger Trail.
   Wagons, including stage coaches and old-time canvas covered
models, stretched nearly a mile on paved and gravel roads along the
trail, which was used by settlers when Indian violence prevented
their passage on the Oregon Trail.
   Residents along the way greeted the procession of wagons, horses
and a handful of people walking the trail to commemorate the western
migration of settlers.
   The 260-mile Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train is to wind up July 2
in Cody, just outside Yellowstone National Park northwest of Casper.
   State Attorney General Joe Meyer led the procession in a surrey.
Other Wyoming dignitaries, including Gov. Mike Sullivan, plan to
participate later.
   ``This is delightful,'' Meyer said. ``It's exciting.''
   More than 70 wagons and nearly 1,000 people from across the
United States are participating, organizers said. Some signed up for
just part of the way, while others will go the distance.
   ``I thought it went excellent,'' said Val Geisler, the wagon
train's head wrangler. ``It is working and the people are having a
good time.''
   Long lines at the sole portable toilet prompted promises from
Pyatt to add some more.

   A court has sentenced nine leftist Red
Brigades terrorists to life in prison after convicting them of
murdering a Christian Democrat senator.
   Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser to then Premier
Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death in his home on April 16, 1988.
Ruffilli was a key architect of institutional reform plans.
   Three of the defendants were acquitted in the verdicts issued
Friday.
   The leftist Red Brigades carried out scores of violent attacks in
the 1970s and early 1980s aimed at toppling the Italian government.
   During that period, the Red Brigades kidnapped and killed Aldo
Moro, a former premier and president of the Christian Democrat Party.

<TEXT>
   A Mohawk Indian who
views casino gambling as an economic boon to the reservation
unseated the tribe's anti-gambling incumbent chief in an election
Saturday.
   The election amounted to a referendum on gambling, an issue so
divisive among Mohawks it led to bloodshed May 1, when two Indians
were shot to death in a clash between pro- and anti-gambling
factions. Since then, New York state and Canadian police have
occupied the 28,000-acre reservation, which straddles the
international border.
   Norman Tarbell received 637 votes to defeat his distant cousin,
incumbent Harold Tarbell, who got 538 votes in his attempt to win a
second, three-year term, according to acting tribal secretary Stacey
Terrance. Twelve votes were ruled invalid, she said. Harold Tarbell
said he would appeal, alleging voting improprieties.
   With Norman Tarbell's election, the three-man tribal council
ruling the U.S. side of the St. Regis Indian Reservation will
unanimously support casinos on Mohawk land. The other council chiefs
are Lincoln White and L. David Jacobs.
   Norman Tarbell is to become junior chief on the council on July
1; at that time Jacobs becomes head chief and White second chief.
   Norman Tarbell said Saturday that his first priority as a chief
would be ``to put our people back to work.''
   Traditionalists such as Harold Tarbell claim the eight casinos on
the U.S. side of the reservation breed drug-running, prostitution
and other crime. White, Jacobs and Norman Tarbell say the casinos
bring badly needed jobs to the reservation, where the unemployment
rate is about 30 percent.
   About 3,400 Mohawks were eligible to vote in the election on the
St. Regis Indian Reservation.
   Harold Tarbell said Saturday night he would contest the election
on the grounds that Jacobs and White excluded U.S. Mohawks living on
the Canadian side from voting. In past elections, Mohawks living
there were allowed to vote.
   ``Well, I haven't quite lost yet, because there were so many
improprieties ... we're going to have to sort that out in the next
couple of months,'' Harold Tarbell said. He characterized the voting
as ``chaos,'' and said, ``It made no sense to protest ... so we're
going to have to appeal it.''
   Jacobs and White adopted a list of eligible voters based on
tribal rules that allow only Indians living on the U.S. side to
vote. A state Supreme Court judge upheld the list Friday.
   Sixty-two people were turned away from the polls Saturday on
grounds they weren't on the list, said Franklin County Attorney
Brian Stewart, who served as an election official. Most, if not all
those people, were supporters of Harold Tarbell.
   In addition to Stewart, three federal mediators were on hand, and
Franklin County sheriff's deputies were stationed at the tribal
headquarters, which was the only polling place.
   Harold Tarbell, who lives on the U.S. side, said he wasn't on the
official voting list but was allowed to vote anyway. He alleged that
the many people not on the list were also allowed to vote.
   Norman Tarbell said no challenge would overturn the election.
   ``A hundred votes is a hundred votes. They don't have anything to
stand on even if they do challenge it,'' he said.
   Most of the U.S. Indians living on the Canadian side are gambling
opponents and likely would have voted for Harold Tarbell. As many as
500 U.S. Indians living in Canada would have been eligible to vote,
Harold Tarbell said.
   The casinos have been closed while tribal leaders negotiate with
state and federal mediators to end the gambling war.

<TEXT>
   A man who already faces life sentences
for three other rapes broke into a wide grin Saturday after a jury
found him guilty in the kidnapping, rape and murder of a 12-year-old
girl.
   Robert Power, 29, also was found guilty of robbing Orange County
deputy sheriff Richard Welty of his gun and radio in the field where
Angeli Bare's body was found, hogtied and bleeding the day of her
death.
   The Lee County jurors took less than five hours to find Power
guilty of first-degree murder in the Oct. 6, 1987, attack near
Angeli's south Orange County home.
   Prosecutors said they would emphasize Power's prison record in
seeking the death penalty.
   One of Power's attorneys, F. Wesley Blanker, said persuading the
same jury next month to recommend a sentence of life in prison with
no parole for 25 years will be unlikely.
   Angeli's stepfather, Gary ``Butch'' Bare, was relieved by the
verdict.
   ``It's a big hurdle in the grieving process,'' Bare said. ``It
gives me somebody I can point my finger at and say `you did it.'
This was bad enough as it is, but it would be worse if the person
who did it went free.''
   Power, who already faces 10 consecutive life sentences in prison
for rape convictions in Seminole and Osceola counties, blinked and
then grinned immediately after the verdict was read.
   ``He doesn't look real upset,'' one juror said before the panel
was escorted from the courtroom.
   Blankner explained his client's reaction: ``Mr. Power was
prepared for the worst in this situation. We didn't kid him. We knew
it would be tough to convince a jury otherwise.''
   Circuit Judge Gary Formet set the sentencing phase of the trial
for sometime next month.
   Power's attorneys hope that his prison record _ he has spent all
but two years of his adult life in jail _ will help him.
   ``The jury will hear that he hasn't done well in the outside
world,'' Blankner said. ``But he's demonstrated that he's done well
in a controlled environment. He's been a model inmate.''
   Blankner also said he will present evidence that Power was
physically abused and sexually assaulted as a child.
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, have said they will use Power's previous
convictions and details of Angeli's slaying to try to persuade the
jury to recommend death for Powers.
   Power was convicted of raping two Kissimmee sisters, ages 12 and
16, and a Longwood woman, all within a month of Angeli's death.
Formet barred prosecutors from using that evidence during the
two-week trial, which was moved to Lee County because of publicity.
   Angeli was found half-naked, hogtied and gagged in the field,
bleeding from both the rape and a fatal stab wound in her neck. She
had been punched in the face and her glasses were broken.
   Welty identified Power from the witness stand as the man who
stole his radio and gun. Radio parts, one bearing the same serial
number as Welty's radio, were found in the house where Power was
arrested eight days after the murder.
   Blankner and Power's other attorney, Joerg Jaeger, said they will
appeal. If Power is sentenced to death, the Florida Supreme Court
will automatically hear the appeal.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials say New York must limit toxic
discharges from its sewage treatment plants to clean up the city's
harbor, according to The New York Times.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is to announce next week
the strategies the city must develop in limiting copper and mercury
discharges from its 14 treatment plants, according to a report in
Sunday's paper.
   The city must limit the discharges by June 1993 in order to meet
federal water quality standards, the Times said.
   The limits also will apply to about 50 other municipal sewage
treatment plants and industries in New York and New Jersey that
discharge into New York harbor, the report said.
   The discharged metals, many of which originate from household
pipes and industries such as metal finishing, build up in the tissue
of the city's harbor shellfish, which have some of the highest
levels of heavy-metal contamination in the nation, according to the
Times.
   Sewage treatment plants cannot filter the metals, which go into
the harbor in liquids or sludge, the report said.
   The federal agency's decision to require controls on toxic
discharges was disclosed in a letter from Richard Caspe, a regional
director of the federal agency, to Administrative Law Judge Andrew
Pearlstein.
   Pearlstein is hearing a lawsuit by environmental groups against
the state concerning the discharges.

   You can buy a velvet Elvis portrait
anywhere, but only this weekend could you get a great deal on Aunt
Bee's rake.
   Just about anything at the late Frances Bavier's house went up
for sale Saturday.
   The actress, who died in December at age 86, portrayed the
matronly head of the Taylor household in the popular ``Andy Griffith
Show,'' which is nearing its 30th anniversary and enjoying continued
life in syndication.
   One of Ms. Bavier's last wishes was to leave the contents of her
Siler City home to the University of North Carolina Center for
Public Television endowment fund.
   And you could find it all during a morning sale open to the
public, some of whom traveled from as far away as Minnesota and
Florida for the buying and bidding.
   What didn't get snapped up before lunch then went up for an
afternoon auction. That included the yellowed copies of Ms. Bavier's
contracts and her guacamole-green Studebaker Daytona with 43,000
miles, rotting tires and a ceramic donkey on the dashboard.
   The center raised about $120,000, spokeswoman AlexSandra Lett
said.
   The car was auctioned for $20,000 to Stanley Bingham and Brown
Loflin, both of Denton. They plan to exhibit it at an annual tractor
show.
   A sofa was auctioned for $1,400, she said. A Queen Anne dining
table with six chairs went for $1,800.
   ``This is what she lived with and what she sat on and what she
ate, held and touched,'' said Priscilla Bratcher, director of
development and community relations for the center.
   Books, mostly novels, and lamps were most popular amid the end
tables, chests of drawers and furniture. The rake went to Glennie
Bell of nearby Garner, who said it was for her husband. The price:
$45.
   ``He's a fan and he better not use it,'' she said. ``It'll go in
a storage room right now, in a corner that he won't touch. Maybe
we'll hang it up in the den later.''
   Jackie Hawley of Four Oaks bought a tree trimmer for $20 because
``I didn't have one.''
   Bud Kendrick and his wife, Penny, made the three-hour drive from
Charlotte and walked out of the sale with a writing table, slightly
water-stained but a priceless treasure by their standards.
   ``It's Aunt Bee. Everybody wants a little bit of Aunt Bee to take
home with them,'' Kendrick said. ``She was on television so long and
so much a part of your life and you watched her. You just want to
take a little bit of that home.''
   Mrs. Kendrick watches the show at home every day, and says she's
plans to bone up on her Griffith history.
   ``There's a college course you can take now in Charlotte. I'm

   Early in her retirement, Miss Bavier sought to escape
identification with her television past. But in her later years, she
became reclusive and increasingly referred to herself as Aunt Bee
and continued to wear her hair in a bun, her lawyer and a close
friend for many years, J. Samuel Williams, has said.
   One volunteer said the item which a lot of people avoided was the
four-poster bed in which Ms. Bavier died. The bed eventually sold
for $850.

   A thief broke a 13th century stained glass window
and stole $2,200 from a collection box at Westminster Abbey, where
Britain's monarchs have been crowned for more than 900 years, police
said Saturday.
   The box was put out for donations to restore the abbey. The
police said they believe the thief reached the window at night by
climbing scaffolding for the building work outside St. George's
Chapel.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said the burglary took place
Tuesday, but they would not say why news of it was initially
withheld.
   No arrests were reported.
   Kings and queens since William I in 1066 have been crowned in the
abbey, which was largely rebuilt from the 13th century onward. Many
monarchs as well as illustrious writers, poets and scientists were
entombed there.

   The rock band Foreigner's drummer and his wife
jumped into the Atlantic Ocean as fire engulfed their yacht
Saturday, and were rescued after a Coast Guard jet spotted them and
dropped a raft into the water.
   The 43-foot yacht Charisma III exploded and sank as Dennis
Elliott and his wife, Iona, were picked up in good condition by the
crew of a nearby freighter, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Terry
Johns.
   The couple, who were alone on the yacht, said they noticed the
fire in the engine room around 3 p.m. Saturday during a trip from
the Bahamas to Fort Lauderdale, when they were about 45 miles east
of the Florida coast.
   ``I got out a fire extinguisher ... but I was choking so badly _
we just had time to get out a mayday call,'' a bedraggled-looking
Eliott said later. ``The heat in the boat got so bad that the
windows shattered and the flames went up, so we knew we had to
abandon the ship.''
   A Coast Guard Falcon jet was already airborne when the call came
in at 3:10 p.m. and was able to drop the raft to the couple 10
minutes later, said Petty Officer Terry Johns.
   The 600-foot Liberian cargo ship Stena Trailer also responded to
Elliott's distress signal. As the freighter's crew helped them from
the raft, the yacht, which had a full tank of diesel fuel, exploded
and sank to the bottom, Johns said.
   The Elliots were later hoisted one by one into a Coast Guard
helicopter hovering over the freighter, and taken Freeport, Bahamas,
where another jet took them back to Opa Locka airport north of Miami.
   The couple, who were able to save nothing from the boat, left Opa
Locka to spend the night at a Fort Lauderdale hotel before returning
home to Sherman, Conn., Johns said.

   Lava slithering from Kilauea Volcano
ignited a church and a home in the rural beach community where 160
buildings have been consumed by waves of molten rock.
   The Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church burned late Friday
and a home across the street caught fire early Saturday, said Civil
Defense spokesman Lanny Nakano.
   The congregation had decided not to move their church during an
earlier threat in May.
   The massive front of slowly advancing lava came within 10 feet of
Walter Yamaguchi's abandoned Kalapana Store and Drive-Inn before
turning toward the ocean, Nakano said.
   The creeping lava reached the ocean late Saturday morning.
   Twenty-one homes remain in the Kalapana area, but only a few are
occupied. Since Kilauea eruptions resumed on Jan. 3, 1983, 160
buildings have been destroyed.
   The flow is being fed from lava welling at an estimated rate of
650,000 cubic yards a day from a vent in the volcano's east rift
zone, about seven miles upslope from this decimated coastal
community on the island of Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   This selective resort town has denied a
permit for an Independence Day parade sought by the Ku Klux Klan.
   The request from Richard Ford, imperial wizard of the Fraternal
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was rejected Friday by Police
Chief Joe Terlizzese.
   ``He told me that this is a resort town. Nobody is interested in
the KKK,'' said Ford, who estimated the parade would have 100 to 450
marchers.
   ``We do not have parades over here,'' said police officer Craig
Gunkel, speaking for the chief. ``We've got narrow streets, no
parking. There's really just no place to hold it.''
   A town ordinance allows parades at the discretion of the chief
and town manager.
   ``My definition of a parade is something that is town-serving:
the high school band, entertainment,'' Gunkel said. ``This is an
outside group trying to use our town.''
   Ford, a retired television repairman from Lantana, said he picked
Palm Beach because ``it's by the ocean. It would be a good place.''
He notified the American Civil Liberties Union of the permit
rejection.
   ``A town or city cannot condition issuance of a parade permit on
whether it is `town-serving,''' said ACLU attorney James Green. The
courts have ruled people have ``the right to express their views no
matter how onerous or hateful those ideas might be,'' he said.

   Red ribbons were tied to trees in front of
the governor's mansion and neighbors mowed their lawns Saturday as
Minnesotans made last-minute preparations for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's historic visit.
   Tom Knutson, part of a five-member crew installing a snow-fence
barricade across the street from the mansion, said he didn't mind
working overtime to prepare for Sunday's event.
   ``It's great; it's once-in-a-lifetime,'' said Knutson, 52.
   The 1,800 feet to 2,000 feet of fence will be used to confine
reporters and photographers to an area across the street from the
mansion, where Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, are to dine with Gov.
Rudy Perpich and his wife, Lola.
   According to the itinerary, the Soviets are to arrive at 1:25
p.m. Sunday from the summit conference with President Bush in
Washington.
   After landing at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, they
are to travel by motorcade to the mansion, eat lunch and take a
limousine tour of the Twin Cities.
   Orange- and white-striped highway barricades were in place along
both sides of the route to the state Capitol, which is on the tour.
Yellow rope to hold back the thousands of people hoping to get a
glimpse of the visitors was waiting to be hoisted.
   At the mansion, red ribbons were tied to trees in front and ``No
Parking'' signs were everywhere. A yellow-and-black portable highway
sign saying ``Welcome'' in Russian and English hung over Interstate
94 between St. Paul and Minneapolis, where Gorbachev is to meet with
145 business and agricultural leaders while Mrs. Gorbachev visits a
Minneapolis family.
   The entire group will tour a dairy farm in Farmington about 20
miles south of Minneapolis and Control Data Corp. in suburban
Bloomington. The Soviets are to depart for San Francisco at 8 p.m.,
according to the itinerary.

<HEAD>Cuban Detainees Rioted For Attention, Sheriff Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARKSVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban detainees in the Avoyelles Parish
jail rioted to get publicity about their status and the likelihood
that they will be sent back to Cuba, the sheriff said Friday.
   ``They have newspapers, TV and telephones,'' Sheriff Bill Belt
said. ``Sources in the jail told us that with all the media
attention on overcrowding, it gave them an opportunity to make news
to further their cause.''
   A federal judge has ordered Louisiana sheriffs not to take in any
more out-of-state prisoners, which bring the jails more money,
because of overcrowding.
   Thursday's 20-minute riot occurred in a dormitory housing 72 of
211 inmates held for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Federal court papers showed that, as of last week, the jail also
held 57 inmates for the city of Washington, D.C., 11 state
prisoners, 22 inmates awaiting trial, five parish inmates and three
city prisoners.
   Belt said two guards and four prisoners suffered minor injuries
during the melee, and some guards and all 72 prisoners in the
dormitory were treated for inhalation of smoke and tear gas.
   The inmates smashed a cinderblock wall with metal footlockers,
set fires in trash cans and threw chunks of concrete at guards
before authorities used tear gas to regain control, deputies said.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Frank J. Polozola gave Belt and
other sheriffs one month to return prisoners they are housing for
the city of Washington. He also ordered them not to take any more
INS detainees.
   The judge criticized sheriffs for putting profit ahead of the
state's interests.
   The INS pays parishes $45 a day per prisoner and Washington $40 a
day, compared with Louisiana's $18.25 a day for each state inmate in
parish jails.
   Belt said the money for holding out-of-state inmates has helped
boost his budget tenfold since 1979.
   Belt coordinates placement of Washington prisoners in Louisiana
jails. Court records show that in addition to the 57 in Avoyelles,
Tangipahoa and Lafayette parishes hold 20 each and East Feliciana
Parish has four.
   The INS says seven Louisiana jails hold a total of about 500
illegal aliens.
   The dormitory where Thursday's riot took place was the site of a
June 1988 skirmish in which nine deputies and 14 Cubans were hurt.
Afterward, some inmates went on a hunger strike that lasted more
than a week.
   Bergeron said the detainees involved in Thursday's incident came
to this country in the ``freedom flotilla'' boatlift from the Cuban
port of Mariel in 1980.
   Mariel Cubans were sent to various parish jails in Louisiana
after November 1987 riots in the Federal Detention Center at
Oakdale. In eight days of rioting, while 28 employees were held
hostage, much of the $17 million complex was burned down. It was
rebuilt.
   The Cubans are waiting for INS hearings because crimes have put
their resident status in jeopardy.

   About 400 anti-Communist demonstrators
shouting ``Do Not Sell Out Our Country!'' protested Friday night
outside the U.S. and Soviet embassies.
   The march was timed to coincide with the superpower meeting of
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Washington, said Sorin Pogaceanu, a member of the People's Alliance,
which helped organize the protest.
   The protesters also chanted ``Yalta Equals Malta,'' a reference
to the 1945 Yalta conference _ where the World War II superpowers
put Romania in the Communist bloc _ and the December 1989 Malta
summit. According to rumors in Bucharest, Bush and Gorbachev decided
new spheres of influence at the Malta conference.
   The protesters are demanding that ex-Communist Party officials
such as Ion Iliescu, who overwhelmingly won election as president
May 20, be banned from office for 10 years. They claim the elections
were fraudulent.
   Many of the demonstrators have taken part in a 41-day-old protest
that has blocked University Square, where some of the heaviest
fighting took place in December's revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Pogaceanu, a 23-year-old worker, said Friday's demonstration was
organized ``to alert public opinion against selling the country
again. We want democracy. We want freedom.''
   The demonstrators marched from University Square to the U.S.
Embassy, where they stood in silence for five minutes in memory of
the heroes of the uprising. The crowd marched to the Soviet Embassy
for a similar tribute.
   They shouted ``Please do not sell our country!'' and ``The man
who spent five years as a Russian can't think like Bush!'' _ a
reference to Iliescu, who went to a university in Moscow.

   The attack-trained Rottweilers boarding at
the Loving Care Kennels supplied the bark. The bite came from the
owner's arsenal that included an automatic machine gun and a handgun
with a silencer, police said Friday.
   Kennel owner Biagio ``Gino'' Grimaldi, 48, may be the first to be
prosecuted under the new state law banning assault weapons, said
Morris County Prosecutor Michael Murphy.
   Gov. Jim Florio signed the bill into law Wednesday. It was billed
as the nation's strictest law to control assault weapons.
   Investigators said they found the weapons and a small quantity of
drugs in the course of an arson investigation Wednesday.
   Grimaldi was trying to flush 4 ounces of cocaine down a toilet
when he swatted officers with a 7-foot floor lamp before police
subdued him, Murphy said.
   Besides the Uzi machine gun, which was found inside a violin
case, police confiscated a .22-caliber handgun ``with a
sophisticated silencer, a favorite of people who are engaged in the
business of murder for hire,'' Murphy said.
   Police also found shotguns, rifles, handguns, brass knuckles,
blackjacks, crossbows, throwing knives, switchblade knives,
ammunition, bomb components and nunchuks, a martial arts weapon,
Murphy said.
   ``You could run a small militia out of there,'' Murphy said.
   State police went to Grimaldi's kennel while investigating the
torching Monday of a car parked near an auto repair shop in
Hackettstown.
   Warren County Prosecutor Richard Hare said Grimaldi knew the
car's owner but declined to discuss a possible motive for the
bombing.
   Bail was set at $850,000 for the Morris County charges, which
included possession of cocaine, possession of a fully automatic
weapon, assault against a police officer and other weapons charges.
   Grimaldi was charged with aggravated arson in Warren County. Bail
was set at $5,000.
   Grimaldi's wife, Theresa, 51, was charged with drug possession
and interfering with an arrest.

   About 70 sign-carrying, chanting protesters
picketed the offices of the federal S&amp;L bailout agency Friday,
demanding that it speed up the sale of houses to poor people.
   The agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., plans eventually to sell
to the poor about 10,000 houses repossessed by failed S&amp;Ls. However,
so far, the agency is only offering about 1,000 properties in a
pilot program.
   The protesters, from New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
chapters of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform
Now (ACORN), briefly entered the offices of a Bush administration
board overseeing the corporation before retreating to the sidewalk
in front of the building.
   They chanted ``We want housing,'' carried signs with messages
such as ``RTC: Rob The Community'' and hammered together a small
``house'' of 2-by-4s on the sidewalk.
   ``They are slowing the process. We feel they're not trying to
live up to the mandate of Congress,'' said ACORN President Maude
Hurd. ``They're dragging their feet.''
   In last year's S&amp;L bill, Congress ordered the corporation to give
poor people and non-profit groups a 90-day option to buy low-cost
homes before the properties are sold to others.
   ACORN is demanding a meeting with oversight board chairman,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Board spokeswoman Diane Casey
said she was trying to arrange a meeting with two members of the
five-member oversight panel but said, ``They're not going to get a
meeting on demand with the secretary of the Treasury.''

   The owner of the Domino's Pizza Inc.
will help build a new cathedral in Managua to replace the one
destroyed in a 1972 earthquake, Managua's mayor announced Friday.
   Domino's owner Tom Monahan, who also owns the Detroit Tigers
baseball club, will be vice president on the committee formed Friday
to raise funds toward building the cathedral, Mayor Arnoldo Aleman
said.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a woman of strong
religious convictions, will preside over the committee. Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua, is
honorary committee president.
   There was no word on the expected cost of the construction.
Aleman said the land on which the building will be erected has been
donated.
   Building a cathedral for Managua was one of Mrs. Chamorro's
promises during the campaign that ended with her election victory
Feb. 25.
   Despite hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church during the 10
years of Sandinista rule, Nicaraguans remain overwhelmingly
religious and church celebrations drawing huge crowds.
   A powerful earthquake on Dec. 23, 1972, damaged much of Managua,
including the cathedral, whose roof caved in and walls cracked,
rendering it useless.
   Opponents of then-President Anastasio Somoza alleged he stole
much of the international aid money to rebuild the capital, and the
issue eroded his popularity. He was toppled by the Sandinistas in a
broad-based 1979 uprising.
   Last year, Monahan said he was going to give up some of his
responsibility at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based fast-food chain to
devote more time to Catholic charities.

<HEAD>Safety Deficiencies Cause Shutdown of Power Plant Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said Friday that they shut down part
of a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant in northern East Germany
because of ``grave'' safety problems.
   Environmental Minister Karl-Hermann Steinberg made the
announcement at a news conference in East Berlin, criticizing
management at the Greifswald plant near the Baltic Sea.
   He said the plant management had permitted operation of a
power-producing block at the plant even though a leak had been
discovered in what he called its ``cleaning system.''
   The block was ordered ``shut down because of grave safety
deficiencies,'' the East German official said.
   Steinberg, who was accompanied by West German Envoronmental
Minister Klaus Toepfer, did not give details on safety at the plant,
but past news reports have said the Soviet-designed operation was
sloppily managed and poorly constructed.
   The West German magazine Der Spiegel reported in January that a
nuclear accident had narrowly been averted at Greifswald in 1976,
when fire destroyed some electrical cables, disabling all but one of
12 water-cooling pumps in one of the plant's four power-producing
blocks.
   East German officials later announced that two of the blocks were
shut down for safety reasons.
   On Friday, Steinberg said a third block reactor was also being
shut down now, while the fourth, which has been upgraded, will
operate until December.
   Original plans called for the plant to have eight separate
blocks. Construction on the fifth block is nearing completion and it
is to go into operation this year, Steinberg said.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday
it will require refineries to lower the volatility of gasoline again
in 1992 to reduce smog-causing evaporation.
   The agency said it was not imposing the new requirements for this
summer because oil companies need more time to retool refineries and
provide adequate supplies of fuel.
   The compounds in gasoline vapor are a principal raw material for
the chemical reactions in the atmosphere that produce ozone, the
major constituent of smog.
   The greater the volatility of gasoline, the more vapors are
released to the atmosphere from fuel tanks, fuel systems and
refueling, especially in the summer.
   The EPA last year began limiting summer gasoline volatility to
9.0 pounds per square inch to 10.5 psi, according to the standard
Reid Vapor Pressure Test, depending on the region of the country.
Starting in 1992, summer volatility will be limited to 7.8 psi to
9.0 psi.

   The Naval Surface Warfare Center began tests
with a 16-inch battleship gun Friday to determine whether an
accident might have caused the April 1989 explosion aboard the USS
Iowa that killed 47 sailors.
   Last week, a test at the center along the Potomac River
determined that propellant bags for the big guns can ignite when
subjected to unusually high pressure. But tests inside a gun are
needed to determine whether that could have happened on the Iowa.
   The tests, using a gun on land, are based on new information from
Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., which studied
possible causes of the Iowa explosion for the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   The Sandia labs reported they failed to find evidence to support
the Navy's official explanation that the fatal explosion was
probably the work of a disgruntled, suicidal gunner's mate using a
detonator.
   The labs managed to come up with a possible accidental cause,
which the Navy had ruled out.
   After a test at the surface warfare center last Thursday
initially confirmed the Sandia labs' findings, the Navy reopened its
investigation of the blast and suspended all live 16-inch gun
firings on battleships.
   In last week's test, experimenters dropped a weighted stack of
propellant bags onto a steel plate. Seventeen such tests were done
with no result, but on the 18th test the bags ignited.
   Representatives of the Sandia labs came to Virginia to
participate in the tests here, said Lt. Dave Wray, a Navy spokesman.
   Tests using the 16-inch gun will be conducted without crew, using
mechanized gadgetry to load bags into the gun and fire, Wray said.

   Americans continue to operate the world's
largest rubber plantation in Liberia, despite a revolution that
threatens to topple that nation's government, a
Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. spokesman said Friday.
   ``We talk to them on a daily basis, and they are the best people
to judge if they are in danger,'' said spokesman Trevor Hoskins from
the company's corporate headquarters in Akron.
   Spouses and children of all non-Liberian employees have been
moved out of the country over the last several weeks, he said.
   More than 1,000 people have died in five months of fighting and
rebel troops from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia hemmed in
President Samuel Doe on Friday. Doe asked the United States to help
end the civil war in the West African nation.
   Doe has said he will hold democratic elections in 1991 but has
not offered to resign. The rebels accuse his administration of
corruption, economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Hoskins said 63 spouses and children of non-Liberian employees
have been evacuated from the 120,000-acre plantation.
Bridgestone-Firestone employs about 8,500 Liberians and 23
non-Liberian management employees, 10 of which are U.S. citizens.
The other managers come from Britain, Denmark, the Philippines,
Malaysia, India and Portugal, Hoskins said.
   Hoskins said Bridgestone is the only major rubber manufacturer
operating a plantation in Liberia.

   A family of carpenters hung up their hammers for
good Friday after claiming a $42 million Illinois Lotto jackpot.
   Winners Edward and Dorothy Sherwin formed the Sherwin Family
Partnership to help share the wealth with the next two generations.
   ``When we bought the tickets, we always said we'd share the
winnings with the family,'' said Sherwin, 70, a retired carpenter
from suburban Lombard. ``It's a family thing.''
   Sherwin said he handled the news of his winnings calmly.
   He said he recalled saying, ``I don't believe it.'' He then told
his wife, Dorothy, who asked, ``Did you check the numbers?''
   The numbers checked out, and ``Then, we finished our dinner,'' he
said.
   They were joined at a news conference with their five children,
who brought their spouses and 16 grandchildren.
   The family members will split $2.1 million _ minus $483,000 in
state and federal taxes _ in payments each year for 20 years.
   Sherwin said he hoped the new riches wouldn't change his life too
much.
   ``All I ever asked was to be left alone,'' he said. ``Now, all I
want is for the family to stay the way we were and not split apart.''
   Only grandson Greg Sherwin, a 20-year-old student at DePaul
University, could think of any downside to the family's sudden
wealth.
   ``There goes financial aid, I guess,'' he said jokingly and
promised never to gripe again about tuition.

   France said Friday it will withdraw the troops it
sent to Gabon to protect French civilians during a week of
anti-government rioting.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in a radio interview that the
situation in the West African country, a former French territory,
was now stable enough for French expatriates to return to their
homes there. Thousands were evacuated during the unrest.
   In Gabon, the president of the National Assembly, Augustin
Boumah, announced his resignation Friday, three days after fleeing
from his home and disappearing for 24 hours.
   Boumah told a news conference he fled because he saw truckloads
of soldiers outside his home and thought a coup was in progress.
Authorities later said the soldiers were searching for Boumah's
nephew, but the assembly president told reporters he felt humiliated
by the military's ``attack on my dignity.''
   Rioting broke out in Gabon on May 23 after opposition leader
Joseph Rendjambe was found dead in a hotel room. His supporters
called it murder, but an autopsy held jointly by Gabonese and French
doctors indicated Rendjambe died of natural causes.
   The oil center of Port Gentil experienced the worst riots. Dumas
said French military aircraft will fly 25 tons of food there as a
donation.
   Dumas said he spoke with President Omar Bongo of Gabon by
telephone Thursday night and Bongo ``assured me that the democratic
processes which he has begun to put in place will be continued.''
   The minister said negotiations begun Wednesday between Bongo and
leaders of the opposition Gabon Progress Party stemmed from a French
diplomatic initiative.
   His ministry did not specify in its announcement last month how
many reinforcements France was sending to bolster its 500-member
military force in Gabon, nor did Friday's announcement give any
specific figure.

   Mayor Marion Barry's attorney on Friday said
``I don't rule out'' a possible plea bargain over drug and perjury
charges, and sources close to the case said discussions have
included terms of the mayor's possible resignation.
   Barry, 54, is scheduled to go on trial Monday on 10 misdemeanor
cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy
charge and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use. He has pleaded innocent to all charges.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy and U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens
have held several discussions on a possible plea bargain, according
to sources close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mundy, in court for a pre-trial hearing, was asked Friday whether
he was ruling out a plea bargain. ``I don't rule out anything,'' he
said. He added, ``All our efforts ... will be devoted'' toward a
``full-fledged, full-blown trial.''
   Stephens said ``we are prepared to go to trial,'' but refused to
comment on the plea bargain issue.
   Later, however, Stephens' spokeswoman, Judy Smith, issued a
one-sentence statement in his name: ``Contrary to some media
reports, Mr. Barry's resignation is irrelevant to the prosecution of
this case.''
   Barry made no comment. He met with his cabinet over lunch during
the day.
   ``If he pleads, there would have to be a resignation,'' said one
source familiar with negotiations between Mundy and Stephens.
``There are a variety of combinations out there, but that is a
constant.''
   Sources familiar with the case said prosecutors have been
informed the mayor will not agree to any arrangement that requires
him to plead guilty to a felony.
   Pleading guilty to a felony would bar Barry from finishing his
term or running for elected office again. Federal sentencing
guidelines also require that Barry would spend at least six months
in a halfway house if he accepted a felony plea.
   Barry has not publicly revealed his political plans, but has held
a number of campaign-style appearances around the city since
returning in March from seven weeks of treatment for substance
abuse. He has been mayor of the nation's capital city since 1979.
   Among matters still to be discussed are whether a videotape made
of the mayor's Jan. 18 arrest would be sealed, and whether a plea
agreement would preclude prosecutors from charging Barry with
additional crimes in the future, according to the sources. According
to court filings, the videotape shows Barry smoking crack cocaine
provided to him by for a woman friend cooperating with an FBI sting
operation.
   Stephens has said the probe that produced the 14-count indictment
against Barry is continuing.
   At the public pre-trial hearing, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson set the ground rules for a series of questions
potential jurors will be asked when the case opens on Monday.

<HEAD>Army Fans Out Across Pakistan's Troubled Sind Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of soldiers fanned out across
southern Sind Province on Friday with orders to seize anyone
involved in a wave of ethnic violence that has killed at least 349
people, the government said.
   Officials said snipers killed at least seven people during a
two-hour break in the curfew to let residents attend Friday prayers
at neighborhood mosques.
   Moslem clerics asked greater Karachi's 9 million residents to set
aside prejudices and mistrust feeding the violence.
   Officials say at least 169 people have been killed since Sunday
in Karachi, the provincial capital, including 30 shot Thursday night
in a sniper attack on a passenger bus and five who died in an attack
on a train.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called out the army this week to
help restore order in Karachi and Hyderabad, the province's second
pargest city with more than 3 million people.
   The government on Friday deployed more soldiers into the interior
of the province to arrest and disarm those linked to the violence,
including members of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and
members of the rival Mohajir Qami Movement, a smaller party
representing Moslem Indians who immigrated to Pakistan during the
1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   ``The army has been assigned the task of apprehending terrorists,
a list of which has been prepared jointly by the army and the civil
administration,'' the government announced Friday.
   Native Sindhis accuse the better-educated Mohajirs of taking the
best jobs and most valuable land. The Mohajirs want to be officially
recognized along with the Pathans, Punjabis, Baluch and Sindhis as
Pakistan's fifth nationality.
   Animosities flared into violence on May 15 and exploded last
Sunday when security forces in Hyderabad fired on a crowd defying a
curfew to demand food, water and electricity. At least 180 people
died, setting off reprisal shootings in Karachi, about 150 miles
south.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A clash between machete-wielding
peasants and sheriff's officers left the sheriff and 10 other people
dead in the remote Artibonite Valley, a radio station reported
Friday.
   The melee occurred Thursday in the hamlet of Perodin, in a
fertile, hilly region of west-central Haiti about 55 miles north of
Port-au-Prince, the capital.
   Capt. Maxi Maxime, the regional military commander, confirmed in
an interview with Haiti Inter that the clash occurred but disclosed
no further details.
   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said officers shot seven peasants
to death, and peasants with machetes hacked to death Sheriff Selien
Thelo and three of his deputies.
   The 19-member Council of State, which governs with President
Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, recently called for reform of the
traditionally repressive rural police system.

   Amnesty International said Friday that more than
400 members of a nomadic ethnic group have been arrested since April
in Niger and at least 40 of them have been killed.
   Many of the ethnic Tuaregs who were detained may have been
tortured, said the human rights group said in a statement. It said
those still in detention were arrested because of their ethnic
origins.
   The Tuaregs are members of a Berber group of nomadic herders who
for centuries have traveled Africa's Sahara Desert in what is now
Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya.
   Many have settled in camps around the sub-Saharan village of
Agadez, where at least 30 Tuaregs were arrested April 11, Amnesty
said. They were moved to government detention centers in the
villages of Tillabery or Dirkou, and some reportedly were tortured,
the London-based group said.
   An additional 380 Tuaregs were arrested later and detained in
Tahoua army barracks where torture is believed to occur routinely,
the statement said. No other details of the arrests were provided by
the group.
   It said at least 40 of those detained were killed by their
captors last month.
   The government has said ethnic Tuaregs backed by Libya attacked
government forces last month in the oasis of Tchintabaraden and the
town of Gal.
   Relations between Niger and Libya have sometimes been strained,
most recently in the mid-1980s when Niger allowed the United States
to build a secret airstrip near the Libyan border.
   Under a new agreement, many Tuaregs have returned to Niger from
refugee camps in Algeria and Libya. Amnesty said some have been
disappointed by the government's failure to provide food and shelter.

<HEAD>Rebels, Guatemala Political Parties Move to End Warfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The rebel Guatamalan National Revolutionary
Union reached agreement Friday with nine political parties in that
Central American nation on steps to end 28 years of bloody guerrilla
war.
   The agreement is expected to serve as a framework for future
negotiations among the guerrillas, the government of President
Vinicio Cerezo and senior military officiers.
   The government estimates that from 30,000 to 60,000 people have
died in the conflict that was set off by rebel army officers in 1962.
   The Revolutionary Union says 100,000 people died and 50,000 more
are missing.
   After five days of talks in a hotel in El Escorial, 25 miles
north of Madrid, the rebels and politicians issued a joint statement
saying the Revolutionary Union will join the nine national parties
in an assembly next year to revise Guatemala's constitution.
   In return, the political parties _ including Cerezo's Christian
Democrats _ accepted the rebel demand that the paramilitary Civil
Self-Defense Patrols be disbanded and Guatemala's armed forces come
under increased political control.
   The guerrillas promised not to disrupt general elections set for
November, but a rebel spokesman said this would not mean a general
cease-fire.
   A rebel spokesman said this week that before negotiations begin
with the government and military officers, the guerrillas probably
will open talks with representatives of Guatemalan trade unions,
business people and the Roman Catholic Church.
   The negotiations form part of a process begun after the 1987
Esquipulas II Central American peace accords. The area's five
national presidents agreed that regional conflicts should be ended
through democratic reforms and political negotiations between
governments and rebel movements.

   While Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev were

   His restaurant will be built in the republic's capital, Alma Ata

   Cardin, who also owns several restaurants, set up 32 factories in
the Soviet Union two years ago to manufacture his Paris designs

<TEXT>
   The government says it will set aside
900,000 acres of rain forest to study ecologically safe methods of
using the virtually untouched tropical reserve.
   The project will be launched Tuesday and is a joint effort with
the Commonwealth, an association of Britain and the governments of
its former colonies.
   Guyana offered the land in the Potaro District in central Guyana
at last year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in
Malaysia as the nearly 50 heads of state who attended looked for
ways of slowing the effects of global warming.
   The district is in the Essequibo region, an area that makes up
two-thirds of Guyana and has been disputed with neighboring
Venezuela, which has claimed jurisdiction over the territory since
the 1960s.
   Venezuela claims it was cheated of the Essequibo region in a
treaty signed in 1899 between Britain, the United States and Russia
that established the borders between the territories. The dispute is
currently before U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Winston King, chairman of the Guyana Natural Resources Agency,
said May 17 the land belongs to Guyana and that Venezuela only has
to be informed about the plans for the project.
   About 400,000 acres of the total area to be set aside have been
identified for a ``wilderness preserve'' to allow scientists
worldwide to study the environment and develop ways to show how
conservation, commercial and community forestry can co-exist.
   The independent newspaper the Stabroek News reported Wednesday
that the Commonwealth scientists are eager to participate in the
project because it offers them the chance to be among the first to
find solutions to the global warming.
   M.S. Swaminathan, an Indian scientist who leads the Commonwealth
group that will coordinate the project, said it will be the biggest
ecological project of its kind.
   The four-phase project will involve the setting up of an
Amazonian Rain Forest Research, Training and Communication Center
and the Rain Forest Wilderness Resort, Swaminathan said.
   The United Nations, the World Bank and other agencies will be
approached for at least $50 million needed to finance the project.
   King said legislation will be prepared to make the area
off-limits to unauthorized persons and to give project
administrators authority over it.
   He said, however, that from aerial and ground inspections the
area is never permanently inhabitated and it remains in its
virtually untouched form except for a portion of the Georgetown
railroad that passes through it.

   A new cell bank will collect genetic material
from victims of Alzheimer's disease and distribute it to researchers
seeking the ailment's causes, the Indiana University Medical Center
announced Friday.
   The director of the Alzheimer's clinic at the medical center said
the repository will spur research needed to trace the genetic and
environmental causes of the fourth leading cause of death among the
elderly.
   ``This is terribly important not just to establishing the genetic
patterns of the disease, but to find out the biological
mechanisms,'' said Hugh Hendrie, chairman of the department of
psychiatry at the school.
   Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disorder of the human
central nervous system that usually begins late in life. Victims
gradually lose memory and intellectual functions, and many of them
must be institutionalized. Death usually occurs five to 10 years
after symptoms first appear. There is no known treatment.
   People in the United States and Canada who have two or more
living family members who suffer from the disease were urged to call
a toll-free number, 1-800-526-2839, to determine if their family
fits the profile the Alzheimer's Genetic Repository needs for blood
donations. Families with a greater prevalence of the disease are
more valuable.
   The repository will then provide white blood cells and DNA
material to researchers at 15 research centers funded by National
Institute of Aging in the United States as well as other scientists
worldwide, said P. Michael Conneally, the director of the repository.
   He said it will be the first such repository in the country
devoted to research on a single disease.
   There are three types of Alzheimer's disease. Under type 1, which
is inherited, symptoms first occur between ages 30 and 50. Under
type 2, which may or may not be inherited, the onset of symptoms
occurs at age 55 or older. Fewer than 10 percent of victims suffer
from types 1 and 2.
   The most common form of the disease appears after age 80, and is
believed to be non-hereditary.
   The first genetic material will be available in six months to a
year from now, and will be provided free of charge to qualified
researchers.
   The repository is being funded through a $500,000 grant from the
National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of
Health. The grant is renewable for five more years, Conneally said.

   A man who allegedly mentioned Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev while making telephone threats against
police officers will undergo psychiatric tests, police said Friday.
   Assistant Chief of Police Jim Moline said the evaluation should
be completed by Monday and the results given to the Stearns County
attorney's office, which will decide whether to charge David Allen
Dalbec, 31. He was being held in the county jail Friday.
   Moline said Gorbachev, who is scheduled to visit the Twin Cities
Sunday, was mentioned in the man's phone calls, ``but the main
threats were directed at St. Cloud police officers.''
   ``The context in which he mentioned (Gorbachev) was
threatening,'' Moline said, but he refused to be more specific.
   St. Cloud is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
   Police Chief Dennis O'Keefe said Thursday that the man made
several calls to police Tuesday and was arrested the next day.

first lady Barbara Bush's selection as Wellesley College's
commencement speaker praised her address, which ended with an ironic
comment on first spousehood.
   Mrs. Bush appeared with Raisa Gorbachev at Friday's ceremony and
later credited the Soviet first lady with the warm reception they
received, calling her ``my secret weapon.''
   Mrs. Bush stressed the importance of family life in her speech to
the graduating women. But she received the loudest cheers when she
closed saying, ``Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone
who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White
House as the President's spouse. I wish him well!''
   One of the 575 seniors had painted on her mortar board ``Barbara
Bush for President 1992.'' Another wore a picture of President and
Mrs. Bush, with the first lady dressed in a suit and power tie, the
president wearing a dress.

   President Samuel Doe appealed for
international help to end a rebel invasion and tried to appease the
rebels by promising not to seek re-election. A rebel spokesman said
they dropped their demand that Doe surrender and stand trial.
   At a news conference Friday, the embattled Doe said he had
survived at least 35 coup attempts since he took power 10 years ago
and would be happy to leave ``the burden of leading a country'' to
someone else.
   ``I wish to announce here today my firm decision not to stand for
the 1991 general elections,'' Doe said.
   One diplomat described Doe's promise as ``too little, too late.''

   State boards that license and discipline
physicians are becoming stronger, but many still lack the staff,
money and legal authority to protect the public from malpractice,
according to a draft of a new government report.
   ``Case backlogs remain a serious problem, ... significant staff
shortages continue to impede the boards' disciplinary efforts,''
while limitations on boards' authority prevent thorough
investigations, said the draft report by the inspector general of
the Health and Human Services Department.
   The report is to be released next week. A copy of the draft was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   The report noted that despite the constraints they face,
``medical boards have made significant progress in improving their
disciplinary capacity.'' Yet there is no data with which to gauge
their performance, it said.

   Prisoners in other states spend their days
stamping out license plates. Inmates in a Wyoming program do their
time in the saddle _ or trying to stay in the saddle _ as they break
wild horses.
   Gary Starbuck, superintendent of the Wyoming Honor Farm, said the
2-year-old horse-breaking program molds inmates into more productive
citizens than do prison cells.
   ``Some say they've got it too easy. It's a country club. They
want to see them do hard time,'' Starbuck said as he kept an eye on
the bronco-busting recently at the sprawling, tree-studded
corrections ranch.
   ``But what you end up with is someone bitter, probably harder on
drugs than when he got there. That's been the problem with
corrections for 200 years. It's punishment-oriented,'' he said.

   President Samuel Doe tried to appease
advancing rebels Friday by promising not to seek re-election next
year, and he pleaded with the United States and other allies to help
end the revolt.
   A U.S.-based spokesman for the rebels said they had dropped their
demand that Doe surrender and stand trial for alleged corruption and
atrocities. The spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, said if Doe left Liberia,
the insurgents would be willing to work with the existing regime to
set up an interim government.
   He said his comments were approved by Charles Taylor, leader of
the rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia that was marching
toward Monrovia.
   Doe, threatened by rebels approaching from two fronts, told
reporters Friday: ``I wish to announce here today my firm decision
not to stand for the 1991 general elections.''
   The 6-month-old incursion had reached within 35 miles of the
capital, Monrovia. More than 1,000 people have been killed in the
six months of fighting, most of them civilians slain by government
troops.
   The U.S. Navy stationed ships off the coast to evacuate Americans
if necessary. U.S. Embassy officials said about 2,000 U.S. citizens,
including scores of missionaries and many people of Liberian origin,
remain in the country.

   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev gave the
graduating women of Wellesley College some first-lady advice Friday
and then rejoiced in their newfound friendship.
   ``I simply feel very at home and comfortable with Mrs. Gorbachev
and I have enormous respect for her,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters as
the pair toured Boston after sharing the commencement platform.
   Said Mrs. Gorbachev: ``I particularly rejoice at the fact that
our conversations are extremely open, sincere and friendly. And
despite the fact that we might have differences, that does not
change the tone.''
   At Wellesley's graduation ceremonies, where Mrs. Bush disarmed
critics who had argued that she was not a suitable role model for
women in the '90s. ``I never dreamed, it would be this much fun,''
the American first lady said.
   The crowd cheered, ``Barbara, Barbara, Barbara'' as Mrs. Bush
spoke unabashedly about her homemaker's life, while urging the
graduates to pursue professional careers if that was their goal.
   Mrs. Bush, who dropped out of college to marry George Bush as
World War II raged a continent away, wore a black academic robe with
a purple cowl. Mrs. Gorbachev, a philosophy Ph.D and former
university lecturer, wore a plaid gray suit and pink blouse. More
conspicuous were the graduates who wore purple armbands, signaling
their lingering belief that Mrs. Bush's life has epitomized the
victory of fealty to family over feminist emergence.

<HEAD>Reflections From South Africa's Most Popular Music Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Shabalala sits in an office at
Warner Bros. Records, alternately looking out the window and back at
his questioner. He is contemplating how Ladysmith Black Mambazo
became an overnight sensation after only 30 years in the music
business.
   ``Yes, we are still amazed, even now,'' he says in melodious
South African-accented English. The soft-spoken but gregarious
Shabalala, who looks much younger than his 49 years, is the founder,
lead singer, composer and spiritual guide of perhaps the most
popular singing group to ever come out of South Africa.
   ``It has been wonderful, it has been gratifying, to be doing
God's gift,'' he said. After all, his group has been touring and
recording almost constantly since its 1986 appearance on Paul
Simon's Grammy-winning ``Graceland'' album.
   And after two hit records, a Grammy of their own and concerts in
Europe, the United States and Japan, there is much for Shabalala and
the nine other members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo to smile about.
   But it wasn't always so.
   On this recent day, as the group prepared for its fourth U.S.
concert tour, Shabalala and fellow singer Albert Mazibuko reminisce
about another time, when the group could only be heard on South
Africa's Radio Zulu; when it could only play in front of black
audiences; when it was South Africa's best-kept musical secret.
   That was a lifetime before appearances on ``Saturday Night Live''
and ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' and the adulation of
audiences of all colors.
   It was a time of crisscrossing South Africa for the joy of
performing, of singing all night on Saturday and all day on Sunday
in places such as Durban or Soweto, then driving all night to get
back to work in their hometown of Ladysmith.
   The 42-year-old Mazibuko smiled as he remembered how those
all-night song festivals once cost him his job with a construction
company.
   ``We would always come to work very late on Mondays because we
had been out singing all night,'' he said. ``One Monday we arrived
very, very late. But since then I've been able to make my living
singing, so it worked out.''
   But even if it hadn't, just the singing, the opportunity to blend
10 voices as though they were an orchestra of instruments, and to
sing better than anybody in the township, always made it worth it,
said Shabalala.
   ``It took me 10 years to develop the group,'' he recalled. ``All
along we were singing in the townships, in the halls, all night
long, with maybe 20 other groups. And when you won the gold medal,
you knew you were the biggest, the best group there _ and Black
Mambazo won many gold medals.''
   Then came the records. The group recorded 27 on South African
labels, selling millions of copies, although the music was only
heard on Radio Zulu, a black station.
   The songs, almost always performed a cappella and often about
day-to-day life in black South Africa, are heard around the world
now and are praised as being uncommonly beautiful. The praise has a
familiar ring to it.
   ``During the Graceland tour (the group's first in America),
people wrote that we were a joyous voice from Africa,'' Shabalala
recalled. ``I thought when my people in Soweto used to say things
like that it was because they understood the language. But even
people who don't understand, they say the same thing.''
   For years it wasn't the language barrier, but apartheid, South
Africa's policy of racial separation, that kept Black Mambazo from
the rest of the world.
   Simon discovered the group through a South African friend in the
mid-1980s. As captivated as everyone else, he tried to call
Shabalala, who was on a tour of the townships at the time.
   ``When I came home my wife said there's a white guy from America
who keeps calling,'' Shabalala said, chuckling at the memory.
   The two met and decided to record together, but first Shabalala
had to convince the others in Black Mambazo that this white outsider
was really all right. He'd never even been that trusting of whites
himself.
   ``But I was trusting of him right from the beginning,'' he said.
``I don't know why, except that he was soft-spoken, he was very
polite and he looked me right in the eye.''
   And so ``Graceland'' gave Black Mambazo to the world. Its own
Grammy-winning record, ``Shaka Zula,'' followed, as did ``Journey of
Dreams'' and the soon-to-be-released ``Two Worlds One Heart.''
   Along with a new worldwide audience has come acceptance among
whites in South Africa.
   ``They even promote us to white audiences now,'' Shabalala said.
``When we sing in the townships now, sometimes people ask me what is
this (singing in front of white people)? I tell them it's freedom.''

<HEAD>Chrysler's Leadership Succession Vaguer Than Politburo Guessing
Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The aging chairman had said he would retire
eventually, but never specified a date or certain successor. His
likely replacement abruptly resigned, leaving the future leader's
identity even murkier.
   That may sound like a Politburo political intrigue that could
only haunt the inner sanctums of the Kremlin or Beijing's Great Hall
of the People. But it happened in a den of capitalism this past
week, Chrysler Corp.'s headquarters in Highland Park, Mich.
   Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald's unexpected departure from
Chrysler to head an employee buyout of airline giant UAL Corp. came
as a surprise not only to company outsiders but also evidently to
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca.
   Iacocca was vacationing at his Italian villa retreat when
Greenwald personally delivered the news. They flew back together for
the official announcement.
   Greenwald said he was pursuing a new challenge rather than
fleeing uncertainty and frustration in an industry that is under
severe competitive pressure. He also denied suggestions of internal
dissension at the top.
   But management experts said Greenwald's resignation had the
effect of raising basic questions about whether Chrysler's own
management team had long-term faith in its future. He was the third
senior executive to quit in a month. ``If someone at that high level
who is in line to be the CEO prefers another CEO's job in a
different kind of industry, it makes you wonder why he made that
jump,'' said Richard M. Cyert, president of Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. ``That's a worrisome thing. I'd worry very
much as a Chrysler stockholder. As an American I worry about it.''
   Greenwald, 54, had been considered the leading candidate to
replace Iacocca after the 65-year-old chairman and chief executive
officer's contract expires in October 1991.
   Iacocca, who helped save Chrysler from bankruptcy a decade ago
and is trying to stem the No. 3 automaker's latest decline, had
dropped hints he might retire but left it ambiguous. So questions
have persisted about who might succeed him and when.
   The uncertainty was reinforced by Chrysler's response to the
Greenwald departure. It expanded the duties of two other
senior-level managers, Robert A. Lutz and Robert S. Miller Jr., to
fill the void. They both evidently are now the leading candidates to
lead Chrysler after Iacocca but that remains unclear. Some outside
management experts said Chrysler's scrambled reaction was a signal
that the company had no contingency arrangement to handle an
unexpected event like the Greenwald resignation.
   ``That's not surprising,'' said Gilbert E. Dwyer, president of
the Dwyer Consulting Group, a New York-based management consulting
and executive recuitment firm. ``Once you've made it clear to an
individual that he's going to be the next CEO, you really don't
expect he's going to change his mind.''
   Gerald C. Myers, a management expert and former chairman of
now-defunct American Motors Corp. acquired by Chrysler three years
ago, declined to comment specifically about the company because of
his personal relationship with its executives. But he said that in
general, management succession is one of the most critical problems
any company can face.
   ``There's a need to as early as possible designate the time of
succession, the people who will be involved and those who won't,''
said Myers, who wrote ``When It Hits the Fan,'' a book about
management crises.
   ``The infighting, the unhappiness, the ulcers, the bad media, all
these things boil out if it's not clear,'' he said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Contradictory evidence emerged over the state of the economy. A
widely followed monthly survey of purchasing managers suggested the
nation's manufacturing improved in May. But government figures
showed private job growth stalled in May, and construction spending
and factory orders fell in April, indicating persistent
sluggishness. The markets rallied on the bad news because it implied
interest rates will decline, making stocks and bonds more valuable.
   _Two leading U.S. exporters signed major deals with Communist
superpowers. Boeing Co. sold jetliners to China in an arrangement
worth at least $2 billion and possibly $4 billion. International
Business Machines Corp., using the Soviet-U.S. summit as a backdrop,
announced it would provide 13,000 personal computers to Soviet
schools for an undisclosed amount.
   _Coca-Cola Co. put the lid on ``MagiCans,'' its biggest-ever
advertising promotion. The campaign featured Coke cans that
contained money or prize certificates, but they were plagued by
mechanical problems. By some estimates, the company may be left with
500,000 MagiCans it can't use.

<HEAD>Mutual Funds Rev Up Market Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they tally their profits from the stock
market's upsurge to record highs over the past five weeks, many
stock-market investors acknowledge a debt of gratitude to mutual
funds.
   Funds that invest in stocks have brimmed over lately with new
money from investors, virtually forcing them to step up their buying
in the marketplace.
   An awareness of that development seems to have increased other
traders' enthusiasm for stocks at a time when many uncertainties
persist about the outlook for the economy.
   Indeed, to some observers, the resurgent popularity of stock
funds hints at a positive change in the attitude of the public
toward investing in the market.
   ``Individual investors again form a growing constituency for
equities,'' says Greg Smith, strategist at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   The mutual fund industry has been booming for years. Its total
assets, around $100 billion as the 1980s began, soared to the $1
trillion mark by last winter.
   Much of that growth, however, occurred in funds that put money to
work in places other than stocks _ money-market investments, for
example, or Treasury bonds or new vehicles on the financial scene
like mortgage-backed securities.
   Stock funds were generally thought to have reached and passed
their peak as a stock market force during the ``go-go'' years of the
1960s, when some managers of high-risk funds temporarily achieved
the status of cult heroes.
   Today, most analysts agree, it's still far too soon to tell
whether anything like a replay of that era is in store.
   But for the past few months market analysts have been paying more
and more attention to an influx of money into stock funds _
especially since it began during a period of sluggish market
performance, before stock prices took off this spring.
   Through the first four months of the year, investors put $7.8
billion more into stock funds than they took out, surpassing net
sales of $5.8 billion for all of 1989.
   ``The public's subscription to equity mutual funds may not be a
lasting phenomenon,'' said Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   ``If it is, however, it is certainly coming at an odd time. Apart
from all the fundamental factors affecting stock prices, the
mentality of this new buyer may affect market behavior for the
foreseeable future.''
   Excitement over the funds' new clout helped propel stock prices
to new highs in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials climbed 80.05 to 2,900.97.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.32 to 198.03;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
8.54 to 462.14, and the American Stock exchange market value index
was up 3.99 at 363.83.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 172.62 million shares a day,
against 163.47 million the week before.
   A good many observers speculate that investors have turned to
stock funds partly because their ardor for several types of
competing investments has cooled.
   For example, credit worries have taken a little of the edge off
investors' keen appetite for money-market funds. As the housing
market has cooled in many areas of the country, analysts have
questioned whether real estate will work the same kind of
wealth-building wonders in the 1990s that it did in the '70s and
'80s.
   ``Equities are looking better by comparison,'' says Smith.
``Proof of my hypothesis about the change in valuation benchmarks
will come in the form of continued net positive inflows to equity
mutual funds through the summer.
   ``And with lower interest rates, we could have a lot of fun in
the equity market in the summer of 1990.''

<HEAD>Inland Empire Plans Push on Recycled Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inland Empire Paper Co. plans to purchase
equipment by the end of next year that will enable it to produce
half of its paper from recycled newspapers, a company official says.
   The move reflects market demand for recycled newsprint from the
100-ton capacity plant at Millwood, east of Spokane, said Clyde B.
Anderson, Inland Empire president and general manager.
   The equipment, which would remove ink from old newspapers so that
they can be recycled more easily, is expected to be in place by the
end of 1991, he said Thursday.
   Anderson declined to give the specific cost of the equipment, but
said the equipment will cost about $150,000 per ton of daily
capacity. That would be about $15 million at the 100-ton-a-day plant.
   The decision to purchase the de-inking equipment stemmed in part
from requests from the company's largest customers, The Seattle
Times and two San Francisco newspapers, to use more recycled paper,
Anderson said.
   Inland Empire is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Cowles
Publishing Co., which publishes The Spokesman-Review and Spokane
Chronicle newspapers.
   In addition to the newsprint mill, the company owns and manages
more than 100,000 acres of forest land in Eastern Washington and
northern Idaho.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes Fines Against Illinois Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday proposed fines of more
than $610,000 for an Illinois railroad car manufacturer that
allegedly violated workplace safety laws.
   Thrall Car Manufacturing Co. was accused of 141 violations of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's noise, welding fume
and respirator regulations.
   Craig Dowden, a spokesman at Thrall, based in Chicago Heights,
Ill., said most of the alleged violations involved testing
requirements that have been implemented.
   ``Thrall Car has a history of concern for the safety of its
employees and will be discussing these alleged violations with
OSHA,'' Dowden said.
   The alleged violations involved a Chicago Heights plant that
employs 500 workers, the agency said. An investigation began in
December 1989 after employees complained of excessive exposure to
chemicals at the plant.
   The firm, with another two plants in Illinois and two in Georgia,
employs a total of 2,400 workers.
   The company will have a chance to argue against the fines before
they become final.

<HEAD>Panasonic Announces First Rerecordable Optical Disc Using New
Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panasonic announced Friday the first rerecordable
optical storage disc for computers that uses a new technology
designed to make it work faster.
   Optical storage discs hold much more information than the more
common magnetic discs used for computer data storage. But most can
only be recorded once.
   Rewritable optical discs are a relatively new technology. They
allow the discs to be used many times.
   Most optical discs are based on a technology called
magneto-optical. They store the ones and zeros of computer data as
magnetized or unmagnetized sections of the disc.
   To read one of these discs, light from a laser is bounced off the
disc while it is spinning. The magnetic orientation of the different
spots of the disc causes the light, which is polarized, to rotate
slightly. This rotation is then read by the machine as either a one
or a zero.
   The technology used by Panasonic, which is part of Japan's
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., is called phase change.
Instead of changing the magnetic orientation of the disc, it uses a
laser to change the nature of the disc's material into a crystalline
form, which is highly reflective, or to leave in it a
non-crystalline form, which does not reflect light. The differences
in reflection are read by the laser as ones or zeros.
   The advantage of the phase-change system is that a disc can be
rerecorded in one pass of the laser. By comparison, to record over a
magneto-optical disc, the laser first must erase the original data
in a separate operation before it can record new data.
   Optical disc storage is used primarily with personal computers.
It is particularly useful for storge of images, as opposed to words
or numbers, since images are composed of vastly more data, said Jay
Bretzmann, an analyst at International Data Corp., a high-technology
research firm.
   Panasonic said its new storage device will be available this fall
at the suggested list price of $5,000. Rewritable optical discs are
expected to cost about $250, the company said.
