<HEAD>Andreotti's Government Wins Another Confidence Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Giulio Andreotti's government won a vote of
confidence Monday in Parliament on key elements of a broadcasting
bill that has split the dominant Christian Democrat party.
   By a vote of 358-34 in the Chamber of Deputies, Andreotti's
newly shuffled five-party coalition passed its second confidence
vote in three days.
   The opposition Communists and three small leftist parties
boycotted the session, charging the government with trying to force
through the bill.
   The year-old government sought the confidence vote to ensure
passage of a series of amendments to the legislation, which would
regulate state and private television. The amendments include norms
for commercials and anti-trust provisions limiting ownership of TV
stations and newspapers.
   The bill has been in the making for 10 years.
   Last week, five ministers from Andreotti's Christian Democrat
party resigned over the bill. However, Andreotti quickly replaced
the ministers, who were members of a rival party wing headed by
former premier Ciriaco De Mita.
   A final vote on the entire bill is scheduled for the Chamber of
Deputies on Tuesday. If passed, it will then go to the Senate for
action by the end of the week, before Parliament goes into summer
recess.

<TEXT>
   As New Hampshire's attorney general in 1976,
Supreme Court nominee David Souter submitted a brief in which the
state argued against paying for Medicaid abortions and referred to
abortion as ``the killing of unborn children.''
   In an earlier case, argued in 1972 when Souter was the state's
deputy attorney general, New Hampshire defended its strict
anti-abortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing:
``The maintenance of an unborn child's right to birth is a
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life.''
   In both cases, the briefs apparently were written by other men
and the extent of Souter's personal involvement is unclear. And
from neither _ one argued before and one after the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion _ is it
possible to determine his personal views on abortion, an issue
likely to play a major role in his September confirmation hearings.
   New Hampshire's attorney general is appointed by the governor
and by law represents him and other state officials in court cases.
The state's governor when both abortion cases were argued was
Meldrim Thomson, a conservative abortion foe.
   Abortion-rights supporters expressed unease with Monday's
development, just days after anti-abortion activists showed dismay
that Souter had been on the board of a New Hampshire hospital and
at a meeting when it voted to allow abortions at the facility.
   Senators on both sides of the abortion issue have promised to
raise the subject during Souter's September confirmation hearings.
Souter is due back in Washington on Tuesday for more meetings with
senators who will consider his nomination to succeed retired
Justice William J. Brennan, a strong supporter of abortion rights.
   Souter's involvement with the briefs, even if tangential, could
provide a way for members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to
raise the abortion issue without asking him questions about how he
would rule on specific cases.
   ``Clearly the Senate should ask Judge Souter to address himself
to this document at his confirmation hearings,'' said Arthur J.
Kropp, president of the liberal group People for the American Way.
Kropp, whose organization on Monday released copies of New
Hampshire's filings in the 1976 case, said the language in them
``suggests a clear sympathy for an anti-abortion viewpoint.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said the ``use of rhetoric commonly used by
anti-choice extremists is profoundly alarming.'' She called anew
for tough questions on the abortion issue during confirmation
hearings.
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said he
did not know if Bush had been told about the 1976 case. ``What's
important is the president supports his nominee,'' Hart said.
   Bush, in remarks to the Youth Leadership Coalition, did not
address the issue, saying merely of his selection of Souter: ``I am
very happy with the way the choice has been received across the
country. ... It is moving in the proper direction and I probably
won't have too much more to say about it.''
   In the 1976 case, several pregnant women receiving Medicaid help
challenged a new state regulation in which the state said it would
not pay for abortions unless a woman's life was at risk. The case
was first filed in 1975, when Souter was top deputy to Warren
Rudman. Souter became attorney general in 1976 when Rudman went
into private practice. Rudman, a Republican, was elected to the
Senate in 1980.
   A federal district court had ordered New Hampshire to pay for
Medicaid abortions pending the outcome of the case, but the state
appealed that injunction to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Boston, the court on which Souter now sits.
   The 1976 brief was filed in Souter's name but signed by a
deputy, Richard V. Wiebusch, then an assistant attorney general. It
acknowledged that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision prohibited states
from outlawing abortion but said nothing in the ruling or the
legislation creating the Medicaid program blocked the state from
refusing to pay for abortions.
   ``Many thousands of New Hampshire residents find the use of tax
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally
repugnant,'' New Hampshire argued in the brief asking the appeals
court to void the injunction.
   Wiebusch, now in private practice, did not return a telephone
call to his Manchester, N.H. office. He was quoted in Tuesday
editions of The New York Times as saying, ``The language in the
briefs is all mine. I don't remember having any discussions with
David about the case.''
   He said he was reaching for the ``most colorful, most
high-profile language to win my case,'' and does not know Souter's
views on abortion.
   In another brief in the 1976 case that also carried Souter's
name but was signed by Wiebusch, New Hampshire argued that Congress
did not adopt the Medicaid program ``to aid in the destruction of
fetuses.''
   The Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that states have no legal
obligation to pay for abortions of women on welfare if their lives
were not endangered by their pregnancies. The court in 1980 upheld
the Hyde Amendment, which barred spending federal money for most
welfare abortions.
   In the 1972 case, argued before the New Hampshire Supreme Court
just prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling, the
state defended its 1848 anti-abortion law by asserting ``family
privacy and personal convenience can never take precedence over the
right to live.''
   Elsewhere in the brief, on file with the court in Concord, the
state argued:
   ``Without the right not to be destroyed by abortion, all the
rights of a fetus would be worthless. Indeed, without the power to
protect life itself of what use all the other duties and functions
of the state?''
   Souter was Rudman's top aide at the time and several attorneys
who worked in the office then said it was customary for Souter, the
office's acknowledged top legal mind, to review positions the state
planned to take in major cases.
   But his name does not appear on any of the briefs in the case
and Howard B. Myers, the assistant attorney general who wrote the
briefs and argued the case before the New Hampshire high court,
said he did not recall ever discussing the merits of the case with
Souter.

<HEAD>Former Sweetwater Officials Sentenced On Extortion Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former mayor and two former council members of
the city of Sweetwater were sentenced to prison terms Monday for
using their public positions to extort money from a local
businessman on a zoning matter.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen alleged in January that five of
seven members of the council in the small city in western Dade
County participated in the scheme.
   Former council member Carmen Menendez, 51, was sentenced to 33
months with two years of probation by U.S. District Judge Edward B.
Davis after her conviction on counts of conspiracy and extortion.
   Former Mayor Irain Gonzalez, 49, and former councilman Antonio
Duran, 49, each were sentenced to 27 months in prison to be
followed by a two-year probation after their conviction on a
conspiracy count.
   The three could have faced a maximum of 40 years in prison and a
fine of $500,000.
   Two council members, Hugo Alvarez and Lucio Cobian, entered
guilty pleas earlier and were scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday.
   The Sweetwater officials were suspended from office by Gov. Bob
Martinez following their indictment on Jan. 25.
   The three sentenced Monday were convicted by a federal jury
before Judge Davis on May 29. Attorneys for all three defendants
said they would appeal the convictions and sentences.
   The indictment stemmed from a request made by Maurice Barakat in
June 1989 asking the council to lift a land-use restriction.
Barakat, who owns the Holiday Plaza Shopping Center, had sold part
of the land, which left him with less than the five acres necessary
for commercial zoning.
   Barakat asked the city council to remove the restriction so he
could sell the additional commercial units more easily, the
indictment said. The defendants allegedly told Barakat he would
have to pay them $10,000 in exchange for a favorable council vote
on his request.
   Instead, Barakat went to the FBI.
   The councilmen voted to continue delaying action on Barakat's
request until he paid the money, the indictment alleged. Barakat
paid Menendez $5,000 with FBI agents watching, but then was asked
to pay $6,000 more, according to the indictment.
   Sweetwater, known in the 1960s as a rural outpost in western
Dade County, has recently become a haven for political exiles from
Central America.

<TEXT>
   There are few secrets nowadays at
conventional arms negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
where back-slapping camaraderie has displaced the icy atmosphere of
the Cold War.
   Rapid changes that have reshaped Eastern Europe and are
fragmenting the Warsaw Pact have created anomalies at the
negotiating table that were unthinkable a year ago.
   Take the East Germans, for instance. Once the Soviets' most
formidable military allies, they have been pushed to the sidelines
by approaching German unification.
   ``Nobody takes them seriously,'' said a delegate of another
Warsaw Pact country.
   A senior NATO negotiator, who spoke on condition his name not be
used, said his East German counterpart ``doesn't get any
instructions and doesn't write any reports. I feel sorry for him.''
   Negotiators for the two military alliances who avoided each
other just a few years ago now lunch together. And as independent
thinking supplants bloc loyalties, the seven Warsaw Pact and 16
NATO countries happily enlist each others' help against their
allies.
   ``Nobody is worried that the friendship is because someone is
trying to recruit someone else'' as a spy, said a Warsaw Pact
delegate. ``In other words, I don't see the CIA in a Western
delegate, and he doesn't see the KGB in me.''
   ``We very often conspire together with Western colleagues to
accomplish something'' that other Warsaw Pact countries oppose,
said a senior Hungarian negotiator who also commented on condition
he not be identified.
   ``If the more flexible NATO countries want to propose something
but NATO discipline won't allow it, then they ask us to do it.''
   Such thinking was nonexistent at the Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks, which broke up without a treaty last year after 16
years of frustration, stonewalling and posturing by both sides.
   Deadlocks on troop strengths and verification of troop and
weapons cuts, among other issues, proved insurmountable in the
climate of distrust generated by superpower confrontation.
   Enter the Conventional Forces in Europe talks now going on in
Vienna.
   A child of perestroika in the Soviet Union and the resulting
lessening of East-West tensions, they have been marked by an
atmosphere of cautious trust from the outset.
   But the ice wasn't broken until the wave of democratization
swept autocratic Communist rule from most East European capitals.
   That heralded the beginning of the end for the Warsaw Pact.
Hungary, which served notice earlier in the year it is leaving the
East bloc alliance by 1992, recently signed a deal to provide NATO
troops with meat and cold cuts.
   Other members are bound to leave soon as well. And although the
pact has said it is changing from a military to a political
alliance to conform to new realities, most members agree its days
are numbered.
   Nowhere is that more evident than at the these talks. Most
participants, whether from NATO or the Warsaw Pact, now share one
overriding goal: rid Europe of as many Soviet troops as possible.
   The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops each
in Central Europe, with the United States permitted to station up
to 30,000 soldiers elsewhere in Europe.
   The desire of both sides to shrink the Soviet troop presence
from the Atlantic to the Urals appears a prime reason for keeping
the talks going even as the Warsaw Pact unravels.
   ``Nobody wants to upset the present structures on which the
negotiations are based,'' said a Warsaw Pact delegate. ``This would
give the Soviets a prime excuse to leave the negotiations, and we
don't want to do them that favor.''
   A Western delegate agreed.
   ``The primary interest of every nation but one at the talks is
to effect some kind of reduction of Soviet forces,'' he said.
``It's NATO against the Soviet Union, with the non-Soviet Warsaw
Pact countries playing the go-betweens.''

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur Robinson
offered Sunday to resign and call early elections if black Moslem
rebels free him and about 30 other hostages and end their coup
attempt, an official said.
   At least 27 people have reportedly been killed in the violence.
However, there was no official toll.
   Robinson apparently made his offer as he and other government
officials remained wired to explosives and threatened with death.
They were taken captive Friday when several hundred rebels with
automatic weapons seized control of broadcast buildings and the
Parliament.
   Government radio said the rebels were optimistic about reaching
a settlement with Robinson but that they also wanted immunity from
prosecution.
   However, Energy Minister Herbert Atwell appeared on national
television late Sunday with an official statement offering no hope
for a quick settlement.
   ``I am in no position to offer any hope that the situation will
be resolved speedily and-or amicably,'' Atwell said. ``The
situation in Parliament remains a touch-and-go one with relation to
the hostages and their captors,'' he added.
   Acting Police Commissioner Leonard Taylor announced during the
same broadcast that joint police and military patrols had been
dispatched to control widespread looting along the 25-mile-long
corridor from the capital to its international airport and outlying
communities.
   A journalist who was inside the Parliament building when it was
stormed said Sunday the rebels shot Robinson in the leg and also
shot in the leg the minister of justice, Selwyn Richardson. The two
were being treated by Minister of Health Emmanuel Husin, a medical
doctor who was in the building.
   The journalist, released by the rebels Saturday night, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   State-run Radio 610 said Nolli Clarke, an Anglican priest, was
assisting in the negotiations at the Parliament. Hundreds of
government troops were patrolling around the building.
   Coup leader Abu Bakr, a former policeman in his mid-40s, claims
Robinson's government is corrupt and undemocratic. He said on
television Friday that the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and
the destruction'' of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation with
high unemployment and skyrocketing food prices.
   As negotiations continued Sunday, the Port-of-Spain area was
beset by fires, scattered shooting and widespread looting in some
areas.
   Hundreds of looters ransacked stores and factories in several
eastern suburbs, making off with food, refrigerators, videocassette
recorders and television sets. Some loaded their cars with stolen
goods and drove off.
   Looters also hit the five-square-block downtown shopping
district, where damage and losses were estimated at $50 million,
Radio 610 reported. It did not say how the figure was calculated.
   Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah broadcast an appeal for the
looting to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said. ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to
take away items like refrigerators, television sets and videos,
that is not right.''
   A spokeswoman for President Bush, who was in Kennebunkport,
Maine, said Saturday that he was ``following the situation
carefully'' and that American citizens and tourists on Trinidad and
Tobago did not appear to be in danger.
   A government curfew, imposed Saturday by a state of emergency
that mobilized the country's 5,000-member army and 1,500-member
police force, was extended Sunday to 18 hours, from 6 p.m. to noon.
   Some of the 11 Americans staying at the harbor-side Holiday Inn
three blocks from the Parliament building said they were more bored
as a result of the curfew restrictions than afraid of the violence.
   ``Unfortunately, I came at the wrong time. There's nothing to
do. The hotel is nice, but I didn't come here to sit inside a hotel
doing nothing,'' said Rhonda Isaacs, a native of Guyana now living
in New York City.
   Ms. Isaacs said her two children, 11 and 13, have been spending
their time swimming in the hotel pool or watching television. The
family had intended to return home from a three-week vacation on
Aug. 9, but now wanted to leave as soon as possible, she said.
   Radio 610 said ``scores'' of people had been injured in fighting
associated with the coup. The Red Cross urgently appealed for blood
donations to treat the wounded, but most residents were too afraid
to leave their homes.
   An administrator at the Port-au-Spain General Hospital said at
least five people wounded during the overthrow attempt died Sunday.
   The Caribbean News Agency, quoting police and hospital sources,
said on Saturday that at least 22 people have died in fighting
since the coup attempt began, but exactly where the fighting
occurred remained unclear.
   The offer Robinson reportedly made to the rebels was described
by Jones Madeira, director of the government television station and
himself a hostage.
   Madeira said in a telephone interview from a television station
seized by the rebels that Robinson agreed to turn over power to an
interim government that would rule until elections are held in
three months.
   Robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide and
the next elections were not scheduled until 1991.
   ``My information is that Prime Minister Robinson has agreed to
step down and that an interim government of major political parties
will run the country until elections are held in 90 days,'' he said.
   The rebels were holding Robinson with several Cabinet ministers
in the Red House. Madeira said he and 30 other employees were being
held at the television station, which is several miles north of the
Parliament, known as Red House.
   He said 10 other people were inside of Radio Trinidad in a
building near the TV station, but it was unclear if they were being
held captive, as reported earlier, or whether they were staying
inside because of snipers.
   Bakr heads a group of about 250 black Moslems called Jamaat
al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic.
   Bakr lives in Canada for several years in the early 1980s, where
he took up Islam and worked for a while with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. He returned to Trinidad in 1984, said Haroon
Salamat, head of the Toronto and Region Islamic Congregation.
   Bakr's group had formed its own paramilitary squad to raid known
drug dealers, Salamat said.
   Salamat told the Toronto Star that he thinks the coup attempt
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.
   ``All of this _ drugs and social justice _ has concerned him
because he saw the government just ignore the problems. He must
have thought that drastic action was necessary.''
   Moslems, most of them East Indians, make up about 6 percent of
the population of 1.3 million people of the Caribbean nation off
Venezuela.
   The general population is mainly Hindu and Christian and is
about 40 percent East Indian and 40 percent of African descent.
   Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony, suffered serious
economic decline in the 1980s as the world price for oil, the main
export, plummeted.
   Unemployment is estimated at around 22 percent and food prices
have skyrocketed by about 25 percent in the past year.
   On Saturday, Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin talked
with Bakr by telephone. Afterward, Pantin quoted Bakr as saying the
prime minister and the hostages at the Parliament building ``are
wired up with explosives.'' Pantin said the rebels threatened to
blow up the captives if government troops move on the building.

   Niels Nielsen has rappelled down the Old
Man of the Mountain for 30 years to protect the crumbling granite
silhouette from the ravages of nature and man.
   But last week, on his 63rd birthday, Nielsen slipped and fell.
He wasn't hurt, but decided to make it his last trip to the
40-foot-tall human profile carved by nature in New Hampshire's
White Mountains.
   Since 1960, Nielsen has tried to maintain the face by doing such
things as scraping algae, binding splits and diverting water. Next
year, the youngest of Nielsen's four sons takes over.
   ``My father kept asking me to come and it became one of the few
things he and I had in common,'' said David Nielsen, 32.
   Nielsen began caring for the Old Man while working for the state
Highway Department. Since then, he's made sure the face didn't go a
year without maintenance.
   ``You might say I pushed for it,'' he said. ``I didn't want to
see it come down.''
   The state paid for equipment and rented a helicopter to land
Nielsen above the Old Man so he could rappel down. Nielsen retired
from the department two years ago, when he began to work for free
with help from state parks workers.
   ``I'm not a mountain climber. I'm a mountain hanger,'' said
Nielsen, who lives in Plymouth, 30 miles south of Franconia.
   The first recorded sighting of the Old Man was in 1805, by
construction workers who thought it resembled Thomas Jefferson. The
orator Daniel Webster said of it, ``God Almighty has hung out a
sign that in New Hampshire He makes men.''
   The author Nathaniel Hawthorne visited the Old Man in 1832 and
wrote: ``It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had
sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. ... The vast lips ...
if they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents
from one end of the valley to the other.''
   Today, the Old Man is broken and humbled by time.
   The shifting of the earth on Cannon Mountain is splitting its
Neanderthal forehead and weakening its Adam's apple. Acid rain has
burned its face so badly that the granite crumbles in Nielsen's
hands.
   Last week, Nielsen killed algae on the Old Man's face with
bleach to prepare it for an application of acid retardant.
   He is not the first to care for the Old Man.
   In 1906, a Methodist minister, the Rev. Guy Roberts, was
climbing over the face and discovered its forehead was sliding.
Roberts spent nine years looking for someone to help repair the
profile.
   In 1915, he met Ed Geddes, a quarry superintendent from Quincy,
Mass., who a year later climbed the cliffs and bolstered the
forehead with steel buckles. But a short time later, the forehead
began splitting.
   In 1937, Geddes, then 74, and other volunteers carried concrete
a mile up the cliffs in backpacks to fill the gap. In 1958, state
workers strengthened Geddes' buckles.
   David Nielsen's wife, Deborah, climbed to the Old Man on one of
their first dates. Now she is the Old Man archivist, recording
measurements of the Old Man and the names of its helpers for a
yearly report.
   Nielsen hopes his 11-year-old grandson, Tommy, will continue the
tradition, though the boy has not yet scaled the face.

   A union representing more than 80,000
supermarket workers in Southern California called off a strike set
for early today and dedicated the night to discussing a new offer
from supermarkets.
   Bob Bleiweiss, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial
Workers union, said a council representing supermarkets made a
contract offer and the rest of the night was to be spent discussing
counter-proposals.
   The Food Employers Council made the new offer earlier Sunday to
prevent a walkout by store workers.
   Bleiweiss said talks would continue with federal mediator Frank
Allen present. Bleiweiss would not divulge specifics of the offer.
   David Willauer, vice president of the council, also refused to
discuss details.
   ``It's a comprehensive proposal for a three-year contract,'' he
said. ``It's a complete contract that includes wage and benefit
proposals. We think it's a real legitimate offer of settlement.''
   The council represents more than 800 Ralphs, Vons, Lucky, Stater
Brothers, Albertson's and Alpha Beta food stores from Bakersfield
to San Diego.
   The union, which represents 73,000 retail clerks and 7,300 meat
cutters, authorized a strike for 12:01 a.m. today if a settlement
wasn't reached by then. Negotiations began last month.
   Both sides reported no progress during talks Saturay.
   The clerks and meat cutters were demanding higher wages and
better health benefits, said UFCW Local 770 President Rick Icaza.
   ``The biggest ssue is over health benefits,'' said Icaza. ``They
say they must reduce costs and want to shift the expense to our
members. We're resisting that.''
   Wages for clerks currently range from $4 to $13.05 an hour. Meat
cutters make from $9.31 to $14.33 an hour.

and murders are commonplace, children play a spooky game of ``crime
scene'' the way other youngsters play house.
   They mimic shootouts, play dead and act out the role of
detectives cordoning off an area with tape or examining a victim.
They swap stories of those they know who ``got taken out of here.''
   At the Walt Whitman and Ingersoll housing project, the game
became real for a 3-year-old who was sleeping on a sofa bed in his
family's apartment when he was shot to death.
   Ben Williams was hit in the head by a bullet fired through the
front door. He was the third child reported killed by a stray
bullet in New York City in a week.
   Ben's 7-year-old cousin, Barry Taylor, has been unable to sleep
since the shooting. ``He's still thinking about it,'' said his
mother, Belinda Lewis.
   Outsiders should ``put themselves in our shoes for 10 minutes,''
said Zuleka Pass, one of 30,000 people living in the project in
Fort Greene, a crime-ridden section of Brooklyn.
   ``They should know how it feels to watch your children's pencils
shake when they try to do their homework with the sound of gunshots
outside,'' she said.
   Mrs. Pass said the killing exposed the fear that residents feel
every day.
   ``When I hear a shot go off right away we roll onto the floor,''
she said. ``You never know when it's going to come into your house.
Those stray bullets have no name.''
   After 4-year-old Dazmaine Russ was shot in the head by a stray
bullet while playing outside in 1988, children re-created the
shooting, Mrs. Pass recalled. One child pretended to fire a weapon
and another child fell, she said.
   Dazmaine, caught in crossfire between drug dealers, now limps
around the project's grounds. He underwent two months of plastic
surgery for his head wound. His right hand no longer functions.
   Police say the shooting of 3-year-old Ben may have occurred
several hours after his half-brother had an argument behind the
building where the family lived.
   Mrs. Pass said many of the project's youths consider jail and
handcuffs a badge of honor that will earn respect from their peers
so no one bothers them.
   As for weapons, Mrs. Pass's 18-year-old daughter, Aisha, said
most youths aren't afraid to use them because they're not afraid to
die.
   ``It's not like they would die for a cause or something like
that,'' she said. ``They'd die over where they sell drugs, over
money, over people looking at them the wrong way.''

   There is no such thing as a free lunch _
unless you're willing to dine in a bikini.
   One-piece swimsuits, trunks or shorts don't qualify for the free
meals at a Hampden Township restaurant. The deal is limited to
two-piece suits for women and skimpy briefs for men.
   Lou Haines, owner of Graystone Restaurant and Lounge, said he
thought up the promotion as he sat on the sun deck of his eatery.
   ``I was sitting there thinking how like a beach bar this is _
except what's missing? The sound of the surf and bikinis,'' Haines
said Friday.
   The weekday lunch offer lasts through August. Rooms for changing

   ``What's going on here? People just keep taking off their

businessman Joe Mitchell. ``I think I should come here more often.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Ed Gray is tired of his town
being made a laughingstock over UFO sightings he considers a hoax,
but some merchants are cashing in on the controversy.
   Tourism is looking up thanks to a series of reported UFO
spottings since 1988. Merchants are churning out UFO books, jewelry
and T-shirts picturing a beach-going alien ``catching some rays''
from a flying saucer.
   Gray isn't laughing.
   ``I have a real moral problem with my city being couched as a
UFO phenomenon when it's not,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Gulf Breeze, in the Florida Panhandle, made tabloid history in
1988 when Ed Walters, a local builder, reported the first sightings
and produced photographs he claimed were of UFOs.
   He also told of being lifted off the ground by a beam of blue
light from a flying saucer and getting a visit from
Spanish-speaking extraterrestrials who talked about bananas. He and
his wife, Frances, even wrote a book about it called ``The Gulf
Breeze Sightings.''
   Interest in the town's own brand of upward mobility waned until
recently.
   First, the Mutual UFO Network, a UFO research organization, held
its annual symposium in neighboring Pensacola from July 6-8. The
three-day event attracted 600 people.
   Then, six U.S. soldiers were arrested July 13 in the Gulf Breeze
area after slipping away from their Army intelligence unit in West
Germany. A friend of one of the soldiers, who were discharged last
week for desertion, said they went to Gulf Breeze because they
believed the end of the world was near and Jesus would return in a
spaceship.
   The two events generated plenty of publicity. The Miami Herald
labeled Gulf Breeze ``America's flying saucer spaceport.'' Crews
from the television programs ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``A Current
Affair'' and ``Inside Edition'' were here last week to do UFO shows.
   Gray agreed to be interviewed on each show.
   ``The general feedback is it's time somebody told it like it is
and defended the city,'' said Gray, who is a banker.
   Some business owners think the UFO flap is good for the beach
town of 6,200 because it has brought untold free publicity and
attracted tourists.
   Sheilah Bowman, director of tourism and convention development
for the Pensacola Area Chamber of Commerce, said UFO tour groups
are being arranged.
   Gulf Breeze travel agent Linda Belcher, who handled 600 plane
tickets for the UFO symposium, also said the publicity has been
beneficial.
   ``It brought in a lot of money to the Gulf Breeze merchants when
they desperately needed it,'' she said.
   Among souvenirs on sale are $139.95, 14 carat-gold necklaces
depicting a spaceship, $48.95 spaceship watches and T-shirts
depicting a flying saucer over Gulf Breeze and the words
``Extraterrestrial Tourist.''
   Belcher and Bowman said they are undecided about the
authenticity of the sightings, but Gray said it just doesn't make
sense for aliens to fly through one of the nation's busiest
military airspaces.
   Within 40 miles of Gulf Breeze are two Air Force bases, Eglin
and Hurlburt Field, and two Naval air stations, Pensacola and
Whiting Field. The aircraft carrier USS Lexington is based in
Pensacola and conducts flight training nearby in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Gray blames Walters for starting the UFO controversy. Walters
and his allies say sightings by dozens of other people support his
claims.
   ``He has used the city for purposes of his rewards,'' Gray said.

<HEAD>Zoo Visitor Turns Lifeguard, Hauls 135-Pound Chimp from Moat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passer-by became a heroic lifeguard in
an unlikely locale when a chimpanzee jumped into a 5-foot-deep moat
at the Detroit Zoo.
   The man, who asked zoo officials not to identify him, hauled the
135-pound chimp from the moat Sunday and pulled it safely onto an
island where 10 chimpanzees are kept.
   As many as 1,000 people were in the area when the 18-year-old
male chimp jumped into the moat, zoo spokeswoman Pat Butkiewicz
said.
   ``I heard this splash,'' said witness Sherry Huntington.
``People started screaming, `He's going to drown!' You saw him
surface a little bit, then go down. It was like watching a drowning
person. That poor animal.''
   In April, a 20-year-old female chimp drowned in the moat a week
after the $7.5-million exhibit opened.
   Chimpanzees cannot swim because they have too little body fat.
Zoo officials aren't sure why the chimps jumped into the moat. The
outdoor portion of the chimp exhibit was closed indefinitely.

<HEAD>New President Starts Term By Firing Top Military Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alberto Fujimori began his presidency by
firing the commanders of the navy and the air force and announcing
banks would be closed today and Tuesday to stop a run on the
institutions.
   At a news conference Sunday, he would not discuss the dismissals
or details of the drastic measures he has promised to try to end
Peru's economic crisis.
   ``The president does not have to give explanations,'' Fujimori
told reporters on his first full day in office.
   Analysts said the dismissals probably were part of an effort to
impose authority over the military and in line with Fujimori's
promise to fight corruption.
   Fujimori said he would not give details of his economic plans,
about which there is great apprehension, until Thursday or Friday
at the earliest.
   The economy is in collapse. Annual inflation tops 3,000 percent.
Four of five people lack steady work and the government is bankrupt.
   Fujimori has said he will cut price subsidies, raise taxes and
privatize many state-owned companies. He also has said he would
devalue Peru's inti to raise the dollar's cost by 300 percent to
400 percent.
   Last week, many banks ran out of money, leaving thousands of
workers unable to cash their checks. Drivers formed blocks-long
gasoline lines and bread disappeared from poorer neighbohoods.
Store shelves are often half-empty because merchants withhold
supplies in expectation of higher prices.
   On Sunday, Fujimori reiterated his intention to renew payments
to the International Monetary Fund, cut off in 1986 by his
predecessor in office, Alan Garcia. Of Peru's $20 billion foreign
debt, some $1 billion is owed to the IMF.
   The new president also said this South American country of 22
million people needs at least $700 million in emergency aid in
coming months to feed and care for its poor.
   Peru is in the midst of its worse drought this century. Many
crops have been nearly destroyed and urban water supplies have been
drastically cut, leading to widespread disease.
   Economic aid is also key to fighting drug trafficking in Peru,
Fujimori told reporters. Coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine, is
Peru's top export, bringing in $1 billion annually.
   ``We must be realistic. A military solution alone won't work,''
Fujimori said. Peruvians who make a living off the coca trade must
be offered an alternative way to make money, he said.
   The 52-year-old agronomist, who is of Japanese descent, won a
landslide election victory June 10 over acclaimed novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa.
   It was Fujimori's first campaign for office, and there were
strong rumors the military was plotting a coup if he won. The
military overthrew a civilian government in 1968 and ruled the
country until 1980.
   Fujimori denied Sunday that ``there exists any discontent in the
armed forces'' after firing Gen. German Vucetich and Adm. Alfonso
Panizo.
   Panizo criticized his dismissal in a statement to the newspaper
La Republica. The fired navy chief said such a change in military
leadership had never occurred along with a change in government.
   Vucetich did not speak to the press. The outgoing air force
commander ahd been accused of corruption earlier this year by Cesar
Hildebrandt, a top television newsman. Hildebrandt later accused
Vucetich of trying to frighten him into keeping quiet.
   In his inaugural address, Fujimori said he would fight
government corruption, and political analysts said Vucetich's
firing was probably part of that campaign.
   Panizo probably was fired because he was slow in denying the
coup rumors, the analysts said. Panizo was reassigned to a position
in Washington.
   Fujimori has given the military a prominent role in his
government. Three ministries _ defense, interior and fisheries _
will be led by military officers.
   Analysts say the strong military presence probably signals a
tougher stance against Peru's two guerrilla insurgencies, the most
dangerous of which is the Maoist-inspired Shining Path.
   More than 19,000 people have died in 10 years of political
violence in Peru.

<TEXT>
   A 27-year-old cook and fitness
instructor was pulled today from the ruins of a hotel that
collapsed 14 days ago in an earthquake. He is among the longest
survivors of a quake on record.
   Pedrito Dy was rescued about 3:45 a.m. from the wreckage of the
Hyatt Hotel in Baguio, a mountain resort 130 miles to the north. He
was the third person found alive at the Hyatt since Friday, when a
man and a woman were rescued.
   Dy was flown to Manila, where doctors said he was suffering from
dehydration and low blood sugar. Dr. Raul Morena said Dy survived
because he was athletic and suffered no serious injuries in the
July 16 quake.
   ``I drank my urine, sometimes drops of rainwater,'' Dy said when
he arrived in Manila.
   ``I caught water with my mouth and scooped urine with the palm
of my hand. For 13 days, I was telling myself I would die. And then
I cried for help.''
   Dy, whose eyes appeared glazed and whose face showed little
emotion, said he became so despondent that he tried to commit
suicide by banging his head against the debris.
   In a voice barely audible, Dy said: ``I prayed constantly to the
Virgin Mary and gave my life up to the Lord. Then I wasn't scared
anymore.''
   Morena said Dy was disoriented because of low blood sugar but
that he was responding to treatment. He was examined at Manila's
Makati Medical Center.
   Dy said he was among 12 people trapped in the basement of the
hotel wing used to house employees, but all the others had died.
   More than 50 people, including 12 Americans of Filipino origin,
are still believed buried beneath the Hyatt.
   The July 16 earthquake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale. It
left at least 1,653 people dead, 1,000 missing and presumed dead,
3,000 seriously injured and 110,000 homeless.
   Foreign rescue teams in Baguio abandoned the search for more
survivors more than a week ago because they said sensor instruments
indicated there were no more people alive in the ruins of eight
hotels that collapsed in the quake.
   But Filipino crews, many of them miners and other volunteers,
continued the search. There was renewed optimism after two
survivors were pulled from the rubble of the Hyatt on Friday, where
they had been trapped for 11 days.
   The two _ Luisa Mallorca, 20, and Arnel Calabia, 26 _ were
reported in good condition and were flown Sunday from Baguio to
Manila for medical treatment.
   Experts say it is unlikely that anyone can survive buried under
rubble for more than about a week without food and water.
   Baguio, which is about a mile above sea level, has been
experiencing unusually heavy rains in recent days, which cooled the
area and apparently provided enough water to sustain survivors.
   When a powerful earthquake struck San Francisco on Oct. 21,
1989, rescuers pulled an Oakland longshoreman, Buck Helm, from his
car 89 hours afterward. He He died 28 days after his rescue.
   The most celebrated survivors of a Mexico City earthquake in
September 1985 were the ``miracle babies'' found in the rubble of
two maternity hospitals. The newborns survived periods of
entombment of up to nine days.
   Dy said he had finished his shift as a hotel cook and had gone
to the basement to work out in the gym with fellow employees. The
force of the tremor hurled him against an exercise cushion hanging
against a wall, which collapsed on him.
   The cushion shielded him from falling debris, he said. Dy said
he found a metal tube in the rubble, which he used to tap out
distress calls.
   Before they left, British investigators said they heard tapping
sounds from the basement. But the tapping ceased, and they
abandoned the search because they thought the victim had died. It
was unclear whether someone else was also tapping signals.
   Dy said he was aware of the passage of time because a clock in
the gym was undamaged and continued to strike daily at noon and
midnight.
   Officials said Dy's wife and son, Peter Art, were in La Union
province, which suffered extensive damage in the quake. It was
unknown whether they would be brought to Manila.

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
Monday while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to
decline.
   The dollar closed at 148.60, down 2.15 yen from Friday's close
of 150.75 yen. After opening at 149.10 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 148.55-149.20 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 420.53 points, or 1.36
percent, to close at 30,442.95.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the dollar opened lower following declines abroad linked
to a U.S. announcement Friday that U.S. gross national product was
not increasing as fast as expected.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, added that the Tokyo
market was also reacting to a fall in the Sydney market in which
the U.S. currency declined as far as the 148.45-yen level.
   But the dollar was bought up again by dealers wishing to cover
their short, or oversold positions, Kuroda said. And afterwards,
the dollar hovered around 149 yen, with sale orders nearly matching
buy orders.
   ``The weakness of the Nikkei average and the increase in oil
prices are making it difficult to continue buying the yen,'' Kuroda
said.
   On the stock exchange, the index fell on arbitrage sales of spot
issues in exchange for purchases of index futures, said Kozo
Hasunuma of Yamaichi Securities Co.
   The decline was also accelerated by a thin trading volume and
buying which concentrated on specific issues, he said.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond dropped to 85.19 points as of 11:15 a.m. from its close Friday
at 85.23 points. Its yield was posted at 7.595 percent, down from
7.585 percent.

   An 18-year-old accident victim provided a heart,
lung, liver and kidneys for transplant into at least four patients,
a surgeon says.
   Three of the patients received new organs Saturday in unusual
simultaneous operations, said Susan Hall, a spokeswoman for Baylor
University Medical Center.
   The fourth transplant was performed Sunday and one kidney was
sent to another hospital, she said. It was not known whether a
fifth transplant with that kidney was done.
   The organs came from an unidentified 18-year-old woman who
suffered a fatal head injury in a Dallas automobile accident, said
Dr. Peter Alivizatos, director of cardiac transplantation at the
hospital.
   Gene Gilliard of Seneca, S.C., was listed in critical but stable
condition early today after receiving the lung, said Hall and
another hospital spokeswoman.
   ``A lung is one of the more difficult organs to transplant
because it is so delicate,'' Alivizatos said.
   Baylor University professor Shim Park, 61, of Waco was in
serious condition early today after receiving the liver, and Brenda
Strawbridge, 34, of Mount Pleasant was in serious but stable
condition after receiving the heart, the hospital spokeswomen said.
   Michelle Kasin, 23, of Richardson was in fair condition after a
kidney transplant, Ms. Hall said.

   About 20,000 homes and businesses remained
without electricity today in the wake of a power outage that led
looters to ransack more than a dozen grocery and liquor stores on
the city's West Side.
   Police said they arrested 49 people on looting-related charges
after a generating plant fire knocked out power to 40,000 customers
late Saturday night.
   About 15 stores were ransacked, said Detective Luby Novitovic,
who cautioned that it was a ``rough estimate.''
   Three people died early Sunday in a fire started by candles they
were using to light their home, authorities said.
   Four other fires broke out on the West Side later Sunday, but
firefighters could not confirm if they were related to the outage.
   There were scattered reports of looting Sunday night, but no
arrests were made, police said.
   ``We've got enough troops now. We've got them on the run,'' said
police Sgt. John McDonald.
   He said the number of police on the streets in the affected area
had been increased to 300 from 100 on Saturday night.
   Power was restored to about 20,000 customers by 4 p.m. Sunday,
said Commonwealth Edison, but a similar number were without
electricity Monday morning in the 14-square-mile area.
   Police Sgt. Robert Pistilli said that there had been no
burglaries and just two misdemeanor arrests between 4 p.m. Sunday
and 1 a.m. today.
   City officials played down the disturbances.
   ``There is no need for a curfew. There is no call for the
National Guard,'' said Mayor Richard M. Daley. ``It was only a
blackout. There was no riot. There was no heavy looting.''
   The blackout stemmed from a series of small explosions that
began shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday in a faulty transformer at a
coal-burning plant on the West Side, said John Hogan, another
Commonwealth Edison spokesman. The resulting blaze knocked out the
cables that route power to most of the West Side.
   The blaze wasn't extinguished until 6:30 a.m. Sunday.
   Looting began in West Side business districts within minutes
after the blackout and continued until sunrise, police said.
   Some stores were ransacked and some emptied, business owners and
police said. Vandals smashed glass doors and windows, and some
chopped holes in the roofs of stores to gain entrance.
   ``They took everything,'' said Mike Alsars, who was guarding
Way-Low Discount Foods on Sunday morning. ``All the shelves are
empty. All the coolers are empty. The floors look like garbage.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Noriega Tipped off to Invasion by Chatty Soldiers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Money Laundering, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega learned in advance of the U.S.
invasion of Panama when a U.S. Marine telephoned his mother to
complain that it would interfere with his vacation, The Miami
Herald reported.
   The newspaper based its account on secret U.S. Army debriefing
papers that were videotaped by a British journalist. The documents
also describe efforts by a Noriega aide to mediate discussions
about commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Cuba.
   The security leaks that warned Noriega of the pending invasion
were described in some of the more than 140 secret reports written
by the Joint Debriefing Center of the U.S. Army's 470th Military
Intelligence Brigade following the Dec. 20 invasion, the Herald
reported in its Sunday editions.
   Captured Panamanian officers told U.S. interrogators that
Noriega never expected a full-scale invasion until Dec. 17, when he
obtained telephone intercepts and intelligence reports indicating
an assault was imminent.
   The Panamanian Defense Force intercepted a phone call from a
U.S. Marine assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Panama to his mother in
the States. U.S. troops later found a transcript of the
conversation at the headquarters of Panama's military intelligence
agency.
   ``We've been here in the embassy since 10 o'clock last night
waiting for the war to start,'' the Marine said. ``I was upset ...
they want to start when I'm getting ready to go home on vacation.''
   Noriega also received warnings on Dec. 19, just hours before the
attack began. Capt. Ivan Castillo, one of Noriega's bodyguards,
said two U.S. soldiers were overheard saying the invasion would
begin that night.
   And on the same day, a U.S. soldier assigned to the arms room at
a U.S. base warned his girlfriend of the invasion. Another woman, a
Panamanian soldier who was with the girlfriend at the time,
immediately contacted Noriega's secret police about the
conversation, officers said.
   Highlights of the debriefing reports were recently videotaped by
a British investigative reporter, Paul Lashmar of Granada
Television's ``World in Action,'' and provided to the Herald.
   The U.S. Southern Command in Panama has refused to confirm or
deny the authenticity of the documents.
   ``We do not discuss alleged intelligence activities,'' one
official said Friday.
   The documents also contain accounts of meetings between Cuban
President Fidel Castro and Mike Harari, a retired Israeli
intelligence officer and an aide to Noriega. The Panamanians said
Harari was working ``under Israeli government instructions'' to
foster better relations with Cuba.
   Maj. Felipe Camargo, a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in Panama
who had been the general's top liaison with the Cubans, said Harari
began dealing with Noriega regularly about 10 years ago, when the
Israeli arranged for training of the Panamanian army's special
anti-terrorist forces in Israel.
   Neither Harari's attorneys nor the Isreali government would
comment on the documents.
   ``We are not commenting on this subject at all,'' said Israeli
Foreign Ministry spokesman Motti Amihai. ``This is just what some
officer says Mr. Harari said. Hearsay.''

   Someone shouted there's ``a bum in the
bathroom.''
   By the time the passenger's shout in the back of a Greyhound bus
was repeated down the aisle and reached the front, it sounded to
the driver like a ``bomb in bathroom.''
   So the driver, Charles Boyer, slammed on the brakes. And
passengers scrambled for the door as Boyer waved to a state trooper
for help.
   Before things got straightened out, police closed the highway's
southbound lanes for about two hours, stalling traffic for 15
miles. Investigators searched the bus with a bomb-sniffing dog as
the passengers, who had been herded along the median strip, watched
from a quarter-mile away.
   ``Just one of those things,'' said Trooper Gregory Taylor, after
piecing together the details.
   Taylor was on foot, watching traffic for an Interstate 95
construction crew just north of Route 32 in Savage in central
Maryland, when he noticed the Greyhound bus the driver ``waving out
the window to me as he pulled over near the barrier.''
   The passengers started pouring off. ``I thought maybe somebody
was on there with an Uzi or something,'' Taylor said.
   Then he heard talk of a bomb, and saw fingers pointing at the
man from the bathroom, who had bailed out with the others.
   Taylor said he handcuffed the suspect, who declined to answer
questions, and called for help. After about 45 minutes of talking
with passengers, officials suspected that a mistake had been made,
Taylor said.
   But out of an abundance of caution, they kept searching for a
bomb.
   The bus, headed for a stop in Silver Spring, was back on its way
shortly before 2:30 p.m.
   Taylor said the accused stowaway, Oliver Martin, a 61-year-old
homeless man from Philadelphia, had boarded in Baltimore.
   He was charged with misdemeanor theft for allegedly trying to
avoid the price of a ticket between the two points: $8.
   ``He had 35 cents in his pocket,'' Taylor said. ``All he wanted
to do was go for a ride somewhere.''

<HEAD>Ecumenical Patriarch Closes U.S. Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 people heard Ecumenical Patriarch
Dimitrios I deliver the divine liturgy to close his 27-day visit to
the Unites States.
   The first ecumenical patriarch to visit the United States, the
75-year-old Dimitrios was assisted by bishops and priests during
Sunday's service. He read parts of the service in Greek, and a
clergyman translated for those present. A choir made up of choirs
from Orthodox churches around New England sang hymns.
   Patriarch Dimitrios left about 15 minutes before the official
end of the service at Hynes Veterans Convention Center. Officials
said later that he was tired.
   The primate returned to Turkey, his homeland, Sunday evening,
said Sophia Nibi, spokeswoman for the Greek Orthodox Diocese of
Boston.
   ``It was tremendous,'' said Elizabeth Tasis, who got up at 6
a.m. to get a bus from her church, Holy Trinity in Fitchburg, about
50 miles away, to attend the service that began at 9 a.m.
   ``It seems that everybody came to see it,'' she said. ``They say
religion is dead. It's not.''
   ``He is a beautiful man. He will always live in our hearts
forever,'' said George M. Kalanbokis, an usher at the service.
   The patriarch is a spiritual leader of Orthodox Christianity,
which is composed of 14 self-governing churches that share a common
faith and sacraments but are administered separately.
   Patriarch Dimitrios is the 269th successor to St. Andrew, the
apostle to whom Orthodox Christianity traces its roots.
   The traditional seat of the faith is Istanbul, which Orthodox
Christians continue to call Constantinople.
   Patriarch Dimitrios' tour of this country included visits to New
York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, where he met with
President Bush.
   ``This will probably be an event that we'll never see again,''
said Athan Catjakis, a state representative from Springfield. ``I
never thought he would come to the States.''

   The nation's toughest state abortion law
will be tested in federal court this week in what could be the
first step on the road to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Only Guam's abortion law is more restrictive than
Pennsylvania's, which was scheduled to go before Senior U.S.
District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III today. One of the two laws is
expected to give the nation's highest court an opportunity to
reconsider the decision that legalized abortion, Roe vs. Wade.
   ``The significance of it is the race to the Supreme Court,''
said Kathryn Kolbert of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project. ``Whichever one gets there first
raises the question for the court to re-evaluate Roe.''
   In a hearing expected to last most of the week, Huyett will hear
arguments on whether legislation passed in 1988 and 1989 illegally
restricts the rights of pregnant women and their doctors to obtain
or to perform abortions.
   Contested provisions include those that require married women to
inform their husbands before they can obtain abortions and that
generally ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.
   Other sections are similar to some the U.S. Supreme Court
declared unconstitutional in a 1986 Pennsylvania case. Those
provisions:
   _Obligate doctors to provide pregnant women with information
regarding fetal development and their rights to obtain child
support.
   _Require a 24-hour waiting period between a woman's visit to a
doctor and the performance of the abortion.
   _Make information available to the public from reports required
from places that perform abortions.
   Kolbert and other opponents say the law interferes with the
ability of doctors to follow accepted treatment and counseling
standards, invites uneven law enforcement and the harassment of
abortion clinics and staffers, forces families to make decisions
contrary to their moral judgments and imposes reproductive choices
on women but not on men.
   But Robert R. Gentzel, a spokesman for the state attorney
general's office, said the commonwealth believes that ``there are
indeed appropriate public policy reasons for all of the
provisions.''
   He also maintained that the restrictions are permissible under
existing Supreme Court rulings.
   The Pennsylvania law has been temporarily blocked by federal
court order, as has the law in Guam, a U.S. territory in the
Pacific.
   In the spring, the Guam Legislature banned all abortions except
when a woman's life is endangered and outlawed all abortion
referrals.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade outlawed
state regulation of abortions unless the regulations were clearly
to safeguard the woman's health.
   The Pennsylvania law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania, Women's Suburban Clinic, Women's
Health Services Inc., Reproductive Health and Counseling Center,
Allentown Women's Center and Dr. Thomas Allen of Allentown on
behalf of all Pennsylvania physicians who perform or make referrals
for abortions.
   Defendants in the suit are Gov. Robert P. Casey, state Secretary
of Health N. Mark Richards and state Attorney General Ernie Preate.
   Since 1980, when 65,777 abortions were performed in the state,
the number has declined every year, according to court documents.
   In 1988, 50,786 abortions were performed.

   A remote-controlled bomb exploded on a
road near Sidon today, wounding a PLO official and killing two of
his bodyguards as they passed the site in a two-car convoy, police
reported.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the
assassination attempt on Younis Awwad, 40, political commissar of
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction. It was not
known how serious Awwad's injuries were.
   Three others were wounded in the late morning attack, which
occurred on the Hassaniyeh Road southeast of the port city of
Sidon, police said.
   Fatah guerrillas have sided with Syrian-backed Amal militiamen
in their latest war against the pro-Iranian fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   At least 180 people have been killed and 560 wounded in the
Amal-Hezbollah confrontation since it broke out July 16 for control
of south Lebanon's Apple Province.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization fears that if Hezbollah
expands from its hilltop positions in the region to the
Mediterranean, it might link up with anti-Arafat Palestinian
radicals and threaten the PLO bases in refugee camps near Sidon.

   Six people were killed in gang-related
violence over the weekend, including a woman who was shot while
driving her daughter and some friends to a party, police said.
   Gigi Swan, 53, of Los Angeles, died early Sunday after her car
was shot up by alleged gang members, police Detective Terry Wessel
said.
   ``Many of these mothers don't even care about their kids. But
she was apparently trying to keep an eye on them,'' Wessel said.
``She was just following a car through the wrong neighborhood.''
   Swan's 17-year-old daughter and four of the daughter's friends
were not shot, said Wessel.
   She was driving the teen-agers from one party to another in
downtown, closely following a car filled with friends police
described as suspected gang members.
   When the cars entered a rival gang's territory, Swan's car was
riddled with gunfire, said Wessel. The first car was not struck.
   Another of the weekend killings occurred when a man with an
assault rifle opened fire on a crowd outside an apartment building,
sheriff's deputies said.
   No arrests were reported in any of the shootings.

<TEXT>
   Henry A. Stram's neighbors know him as a
friendly, easygoing man with a passion for gun collecting.
   But they were shocked at the extent of the arsenal found at his
three-story duplex in a quiet neighborhood near Cambridge's Central
Square.
   A weekend raid at Stram's home yielded a huge weapons cache that
packed more firepower than the city's entire police force,
authorities said.
   Nearly 200 handguns, 300 rifles, an anti-tank gun, and at least
one machine gun were confiscated Saturday night by police and
officials of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The weapons were seized from Stram's home after police responded
to a report of a break-in _ which later proved erroneous _ and
noticed firearms and fireworks, said Cambridge police Lt. Richard
Bongiorno.
   Police obtained a warrant and for several hours Saturday night
carried out a supply of weapons, which included antique guns,
mortar shells and gunpowder. Also seized were components to make
machine guns, Bongiorno said.
   More weapons were seized Sunday.
   Police were seeking Stram for possible weapons possession
charges. Stram, 50, was not home at the time of the raid and was
believed to have been away for the weekend, Bongiorno said.
   The weapons were estimated to be worth about $150,000, Bongiorno
said.
   ``We don't have an arsenal as large as what we seized there,''
Bongiorno said. ``It's very unusual to have one person with an
arsenal of this size.''
   Stram had no criminal record and had obtained and consistently
reapplied for firearms licenses, Bongiorno said. But even weapons
that appeared to be legal were seized because police said the
extent of the arsenal was a threat to public safety.
   ``That amount of guns, it's unheard of,'' said police Lt. Donald
Carney. ``Especially in a house in the middle of the city. If
anyone broke in and took the guns ... it would wreak havoc on the
streets.''
   Authorities intended to file complaints today in Middlesex Third
District Court, including felony counts for possessing a machine
gun and misdemeanor charges for having illegal fireworks, Carney
said.
   Neighbors described Stram as a helpful and pleasant man, who
spoke openly of collecting guns and being a member of the National
Guard.
   ``He's actually a very gentle man, very talkative and helpful,''
said David Breen, who lived in the other half of the duplex on
Chalk Street. ``He never hid the fact he was into collecting
firearms. He often talked about it.''
   But Breen and other neighbors said they were shocked at the
apparent extent of Stram's arsenal.
   ``He was friendly. He has always been really calm around here,''
said Jamie Waller, 29, who has lived next to Stram for 23 years.
``But if I had known he had so much in there I wouldn't have gone
to sleep so easily at night.''
   Bongiorno said police got a warrant to search Stram's home after
responding to a report of a break-in Friday night. That report
turned out to be wrong, but officers spoke to a house sitter and
observed fireworks and weapons in the home.
   On Saturday, police once again responded to the home, this time
for a report of a man with a gun, Bongiorno said. Officers observed
an illegal mortar at the residence, prompting detectives to apply
for the warrant.
   Breen said a family friend had driven by the house and become
suspicious of a man entering the building and called police.
However, Breen said the man had been asked to take care of Stram's
dogs.

<HEAD>South Korea Urges Border Meeting With North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea today urged Communist
North Korea for talks on a proposed opening of the heavily armed
border between the two nations in August.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said in a message to his North
Korean colleague that a meeting must be held before Aug. 7 in order
to allow the five-day frontier opening, which would start Aug. 13.
   ``There isn't much time left for preparation,'' the message
said. ``If your side truly wants to take part in the road toward
peaceful uunification, we hope you accept our epochal proposal.''
   There was no immediate rely from the North.
   The two sides have not been able to agree on a date to discuss
President Roh Tae-woo's proposal, leading most observers to believe
the border opening is unlikely.
   North Korea has essentially rejected the idea, citing conditions
unlikely to be met by Seoul, such as abolishing anti-Communist
laws, releasing prisoners jailed for espousing unification and
dismantling border barriers.
   The Defense Ministry said today it would allow South Korean
civilians and foreign visitors to tour a restricted border area to
see anti-tank barriers that the North has said are actually a
Berlin-type wall. Ministry spokesman, Kim Chi-wook, said the tours
would begin Aug. 10.
   The border between the Koreas is the most heavily fortified in
the world and has been tightly sealed since the peninsula was
divided in 1945. No civilian crossings have been approved by either
government since a 1985 family exchange program.
   Meanwhile, North Korea charged today that the United States and
other third countries are meddling in Korean affairs and standing
in the way of improved relations between North and South Korea.
   Without actually naming them, the North also scolded its
Communist allies _ the Soviet Union and China _ indicating they
were among those with an intent ``to obstruct reunification and
freeze division.''
   North Korea has been vehemently against moves by Communist
allies to seek ties with South Korea. The South has established
diplomatic relations with every nation in East Europe except
Albania and East Germany.
   The two Koreas signed an accord July 26 agreeing to hold the
first meetings of their prime ministers in Seoul Sept. 4-7, with a
second round of talks scheduled in North Korea Oct. 16-19.

   The nose gear of a Pan Am Express plane from
Boston carrying 44 people collapsed as the plane landed at John F.
Kennedy International Airport, but there were no injuries,
officials said.
   Flight 4805 came down at 5:57 p.m. Sunday after two missed
approaches, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Aviation Administration. She said the reason for the nose-gear
collapse has not been determined.
   The plane, a 10-year-old, four-engine turboprop de Havilland
Dash 7 model, was carrying 41 passengers, two cockpit crew members
and one flight attendant, said Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman.
   The passengers got off safely without using the emergency
chutes, Bergen and Hanlon said.
   Pan Am Express, a regional airline, is a subsidiary of Pan Am
World Airways, Hanlon said. Most of the passengers on Flight 8405
were flying into JFK to make connections for international flights,
she added.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chairman and the
leaders of several new opposition parties won legislative seats in
Mongolia's first free elections, opposition parties announced today.
   The total number of seats won by each party was not available
today. The National Election Commission said it had not received
reports from all districts, and that it did not expect to announce
complete results until Wednesday.
   The count from Sunday's election, which added Mongolia to the
ranks of Soviet-bloc countries that are embracing democracy, is
being done by hand.
   The Communists, in power since 1921, are being challenged by
five new opposition parties born last winter and spring out of
popular demonstrations. All parties agree on the need for greater
freedom and market-style economic reform, but differ on the pace
and boldness of change.
   ``There will be quite enough supporters of democratic change''
in the new legislature to have an impact, said Sonomtserengiin
Mendsaikhan, secretary of the opposition Social Democratic Party.
``We cannot say Mongolia now is democratic, but it has taken the
first step toward democracy.''
   More than 90 percent of Mongolia's approximately 1 million
eligible voters took part in the elections despite heavy rains that
washed out roads in some parts of this Central Asian country.
   Voters selected candidates for the national, provincial and
local legislatures and, on a separate ballot, selected their
favorite party.
   The results of the party popularity poll will be used to
allocate the 53 seats in the Small Hural, which will meet between
sessions of the 430-seat Great People's Hural and have considerable
power.
   The Communists were guaranteed control of the Great People's
Hural because the new parties could not nominate candidates for all
the seats in time.
   ``It's just a beginning,'' said Jargaal, a member of the
opposition Social Democratic Party who was observing balloting at
the Gachuurt State Farm outside Ulan Bator. She said more time was
needed for Mongolians accustomed to a one-party system to gain the
courage to join another party.
   The Party of National Progress, which had candidates for 18
seats, said it won at least seven seats in races for the Great
Hural.
   But they lost a key race, against Communist Party Chairman
Gombojavyn Ochirbat, who took 51 percent of the vote in District
12, narrowly defeated his non-Communist challenger, Ganbold, a
29-year-old lawyer.
   The opposition had made the Ochirbat race a priority because of
the symbolic importance of defeating the Communist Party leader.
   The Social Democrats said they won at least five races, lost
two, and had no information on 11 others. The losers included party
chairman, Batbayar.
   The Mongolian Democratic Party, which reported it fielded 90
candidates, said it won at least 34 won seats. Zorig, leader of the
Democratic Party's affiliated Mongolian Democratic Association, won
his race.
   The Communists have said they might invite non-Communists to sit
on the Cabinet. Mendsaikhan said his party would accept if asked.
   Election observers from opposition parties and foreign countries
noted incidents of mishandling ballots, but reported no major fraud.
   However, a delegation of observers from the Washington-based
International Human Rights Law Group noted that the nominating
procedure favored the Communists and that Communists dominated the
local election commissions.
   Entire families arrived by horse, truck and car at Gachuurt's
school. A holiday atmosphere prevailed, and the elderly wore their
best clothes, usually traditional herders' costumes.
   The Communists, known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party, legalized opposition parties in April, following mass
demonstrations for democratic reform that were inspired by the
ouster of Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   A Communist election victory would not necessarily indicate
popular confidence in the party.
   Urban votes carry less weight than rural votes under the new
election law, skewing results in favor of the Communists. They are
weakest in the cities, where there is more knowledge of the outside
world.

   Losses were estimated at up to $1 million
after a weekend explosion and fire left little but cooling rubble
where part of downtown Monroe had stood.
   The explosion late Saturday night in this town of 13,000
demolished at least eight businesses, shattered storefront windows
nearly the length of Main Street and sent six people to a hospital
with cuts from flying glass, officials said.
   ``It was really an awful experience,'' said Nancy Sarno, a
nursing supervisor at Union Memorial Hospital. ``I was coming in to
work just after the blast, and the area was just engulfed in
flames.''
   Officials suspect a natural gas leak was the cause of the blast.
They were still tallying the cost of the damage Sunday.
   Local police and agents from the North Carolina State Bureau of
Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms waited Sunday for the rubble to cool before digging
through it for clues.
   The investigation was expected to begin in earnest today, Monroe
Public Safety Chief Bobby Kilgore said.
   Union Memorial Hospital treated and released five people injured
by the blast, Ms. Sarno said. A sixth person was held overnight at
the hospital, and was in satisfactory condition Sunday, she said.
   Bobby Kilgore, Monroe's public safety chief, said if the blast
had occurred during the day many people could have been hurt.
   ``All the damage we got, we're still fortunate that no one was
badly hurt or killed,'' Kilgore said.
   Frank Gruber, owner of Place in the Sun health club, one of the
damaged buildings, was nearby at the time of the blast, which was
felt up to eight miles away. Monroe is about 20 miles southeast of
Charlotte.
   ``At first, it felt like lightning shook. It was three big jolts
_ every window was knocked out,'' he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker was ill in
bed with a fever today but planned to continue his four-nation
Asian tour as scheduled.
   Baker was checked by a doctor and will leave Tuesday for
Mongolia and then Siberia, the last two legs of his trip, State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. His illness was not
immedately clear.
   Baker attended only the first hour of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting at the Oriental Hotel. The group includes the
United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korean
and the six Association of Southeast Asian Nations comprising
Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Thailand and
Malaysia.
   Baker arrived Sunday from Jakarta, where he attended the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations' annual meeting with its
main trading partners.
   His speech was delivered today by Commerce Secretary Robert A.
Mosbacher. It said the United States sees the global economic
outlook as generally favorable for economies in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``Growth in the industrial countries as a group will be lower
than in 1988 and 1989. But it still should be close to 3 percent
for 1990 and 1991, despite relatively slow U.S. growth this year,''
according to Baker's speech.
   The United States expects strong world trade growth, with
industrial nations continuing to provide a solid base for expansion
by developing countries, the prepared remarks said.
   ``While the central and eastern European countries are engaged
in a difficult transition to democratic, market-oriented systems,
their reconstruction should be beneficial over the medium term for
the global economy as well as for themselves,'' he said.
   But today the developing countries of Southeast Asia issued a
strongly worded statement expressing fear they will be left out in
the economic cold by rich, industrial nations.
   The statement said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
placed special emphasis on market access and viewed progress in
that area ``as the gauge by which to measure the seriousness of
developed countries in taking developing countries' concerns into

   The new Asia Pacific forum was suggested early last year by
Australia, promoted strongly by Baker, and finally launched nine
months ago in Canberra, Australia. But it still lacks a clearly
defined format and has not decided whether China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong will be allowed to join.

   A Conservative Party lawmaker and
outspoken critic of the Irish Republican Army was killed today by a
bomb planted beneath his car, police said.
   Ian Gow died shortly after emergency services reached his home,
said Inspector Mike Alderson of the Sussex police.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on
the IRA, which killed a lawmaker in an explosion in 1984 and has
carried out several bomb attacks in England recently.
   ``It is reasonable to assume this was another IRA device,'' said
George Churchill-Coleman, commander of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad.
   The IRA is trying to end British rule of Northern Ireland, and
Gow, 53, was a high-profile target by virtue of his chairmanship of
the Northern Ireland Committee. The parliamentary caucus discusses
issues related to the province but has no power over legislation.
   Churchill-Coleman said Gow had been warned he was included in a
list of one-hundred lawmakers, judges and civil servants found in
an IRA bomb factory in south London in December, 1988.
   It appeared that a device containing about five pounds of
explosives had been placed underneath the driver's seat,
Churchill-Coleman said.
   ``My impression is that it was some sort of tilt switch. Once
you turn it on, it explodes immediately,'' he said.
   Police had initially reported the bomb exploded as Gow drove the
vehicle out of the carport at his home in Hankham, near Eastbourne
on the southeast coast, but Churchill-Coleman said he doubted the
car had moved much, if at all.
   Last Tuesday, after an IRA bomb killed three police officers and
a nun in Northern Ireland, Gow expressed his disgust with IRA
tactics.
   ``These murders are as odious as they are futile,'' he said.
``Once again, wives have been turned into widows and children into
orphans, and for what purpose?''
   Gow was an ardent supporter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
and served as her parliamentary private secretary from 1979 to
1983. But he resigned from a ministerial post in her government in
1985 to protest the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which guaranteed Ireland
a say in the affairs of the province.
   He had sharply criticized Nelson Mandela earlier this month
after the African National Congress vice president called on the
British government to negotiate with the IRA.
   ``There is absolutely no way this or any other British
government will negotiate or have discussions with the IRA,'' Gow
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher called Gow's death a ``grievous loss both to me
personally, to the parliamentary life of this country and to his
constituency.''
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, called it
``a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offense was to speak
his mind.''
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said he disagreed with Gow
on Irish issues but considered him ``a man of honor, of integrity
and of deep conviction.''
   Ian Geldard, editor of the publication Terror Update, said he
believed Gow would have been one of the IRA's leading targets
``because of his closeness to the prime minister and his
outspokenness.''
   ``It would be easy for terrorists to get to him,'' said Gow's
neighbor, Jane Birch. ``There did not seem to be any obvious
security. The gate to the drive was often open. They didn't seem to
make any point of guarding the house.''
   The IRA has exploded several bombs in England this year, killing
one person before today.
   On May 16, Sgt. Charles Chapman was killed by an IRA bomb
outside a British army recruiting office in Wembley, north London,
and on June 1, British army Pvt. William Davies was shot to death
at Lichfield railway station.
   In the most recent attack, no one was injured by an explosion at
London's Stock Exchange on July 20.
   On June 25 an IRA bomb exploded at the Carlton Club in London
injuring two men severely and nearly 20 people less seriously. On
June 21, an IRA bomb destroyed a building at a Royal Air Force base
at Stanmore, northwest London. On June 13, an IRA bomb caused
extensive damage to a home recently vacated by a former
Conservative Party official.
   An IRA bomb killed a Conservative parliamentarian and four other
people on Oct. 12, 1984 at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where the
party was holding a conference.

<HEAD>Police In Linden Say Asian Gang Shooting May Presage More Warfare</HEAD>

   The shooting of seven people at a murdered
Asian gang member's burial likely will mean an escalation in the
violent power struggle between New York City's Vietnamese and
Chinese gangs, authorities say.
   ``It looks like it's definitely going to spill over here,''
Linden police Capt. Robert Gerbounka said Sunday. ``There's no
doubt in my mind that there will be retaliation.''
   At least three gunmen posing as mourners dropped flowers they
were carrying and opened fire with Uzi submachine guns Saturday on
about 100 mourners attending the burial of a Vietnamese man who was
shot to death last week.
   Seven people were wounded by gunfire and seven others were
injured in the ensuing panic at Rosedale Memorial Park in Linden, a
suburb five miles southwest of Newark.
   Police said they found signs that mourners, most of them members
of the Vietnamese gang Born to Kill, shot back at the attackers,
The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   More than 100 New York police officers patrolled Manhattan's
Chinatown section following the shooting to guard against violence
between the gangs, Gerbounka said.
   The man being buried, 21-year-old Vinh Vuv, was shot four times
in the chest Wednesday in a drive-by shooting in Chinatown, police
said. A man with him was wounded, police said.
   New York police said Vuv operated a group known as the Canal
Street Boys, one of several that make up Born to Kill, a Vietnamese
gang with members in Houston, Boston, Los Angeles and other cities.
   ``What's occurring in New York is these Canal Street Boys have
been doing a lot of extorting and robberies in the Canal Street
section,'' Gerbounka said. ``They're getting Chinese gangs angry at
them. They've got the label of being a fringe gang, which is one of
the reasons they're taking a beating right now.''
   The Born to Kill gang has been a force on Canal Street, a
Chinatown thoroughfare, for at least a year, said Gerald McKelvey,
a spokesman in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   ``There have been organized gangs of one kind or another in
Chinatown for at least the past 15 years,'' dominated by the Ghost
Shadows and the Flying Dragons, he said.
   ``We began to see them put out of commission either because they
killed each other off or were put in jail,'' McKelvey said.
   Born to Kill members have filled part of that void, extorting
money from shop owners and trafficking in heroin, he said.
   He declined to speculate on what may have touched off Saturday's
violence because the case is still under investigation.

   Vandals painted swastikas and
anti-Semitic slogans on some headstones in a Jewish cemetery and
smashed others over the weekend in what police said appeared the
work of neo-Nazis.
   Police said today that the attack may have been carried out by a
traveling gang of supporters of the National Front, which advocates
the expulsion of racial minorities from Britain.
   The attack in the northern city of Manchester was linked with
two others within the last six weeks, at Edmonton in north London
and in Leeds, Yorkshire. In the Edmonton case, the words, ``We will
rise again,'' were painted on gravestones.
   Police estimated the damage at $128,000 from the Manchester
vandalism, which police said occurred late Saturday or early
Sunday. They did not disclose what the slogans were.
   ``It is a terrible thing to think there are people who would do
this to the resting places of the dead,'' said Rabbi Jacob
Rubinstein in Manchester.
   ``We are extremely concerned to think that, in light of what has
happened to other cemeteries, these people are crawling out from
under stones again,'' he said.
   On Saturday, vandals in Stuttgart, West Germany, damaged more
than 60 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery and spray-painted them
with Nazi symbols.
   More than 60 gravestones were desecrated, police said. Nazi
symbols and slogans like ``Jews Out'' and ``The Gassing Never
Happened'' were spray-painted on some stones, they said.
   Police said they suspected right-wing extremists for the damage,
estimated at more than $125,000.
   Two weeks earlier, unidentified vandals caused similar damage at
a gravesite for Nazi victims in Tuebingen, about 30 miles south of
Stuttgart. A similar attack occurred recently in Carpentras in
France.
   In Paris today police said about 30 graves were desecrated at a
cemetery at a catholic church near southern Toulouse. Graffiti at
the cemetery _ which was not Jewish _ included ``Death to Jesus''
and ``Down with the clergy.''
   Since the Carpentras desecration in May, there has been some
sort of cemetery vandalism almost weekly in France, much of it at
non-Jewish cemeteries and police believe most has been the work of
local children.

   Dick Tracy has a gang of funny-faced bad guys on
the run in movie theaters and Bart Simpson rules television
airwaves and T-shirt sales, but the summer belongs to Spider-Man
for comic book fans.
   Less than two weeks after its release in June, the first issue
of a new Marvel Comics series, titled simply ``Spider-Man,'' became
the best-selling comic in U.S. history.
   And the wisecracking web-slinger snared ``favorite character''
honors in the annual Comics Buyer's Guide readers poll. The
wall-crawler defeated Batman, last summer's box-office sensation
and titleholder since 1985.
   Spidey's success has Hollywood sniffing around for a movie deal.
   ``When it comes right down to it, I can be pretty awesome if I
want,'' Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, says in an
introspective moment in the first comic in the new series,
``Spider-Man No. 1.''
   He debuted in 1962 as an unpopular teen-ager whose life changed
when he was bitten by a radioactive spider. Today, he's a graduate
student in biophysics who shares a New York loft with his glamorous
actress-model wife.
   ``He's changing with the times, but still contains a lot of the
stuff that attracted (people) to the character in the first
place,'' says Spider-Man's editor, Jim Salicrup.
   Canadian cartoon artist Todd McFarlane, 29, gets much of the
credit for the new comic book series' success. Previously, he drew
for ``Amazing Spider-Man,'' the title of the original comic book
series. In 1988, he redesigned the costume to add a ``creepier''
feel.
   The new series' first run of 2.35 million copies sold out, so
Marvel is printing another 400,000, said Pamela Rutt, a spokeswoman
for the country's largest comic book publisher.
   By comparison, ``Legends of the Dark Knight,'' a Batman book
introduced at the height of last year's Batmania, sold an estimated
800,000 copies to become 1989's top seller.
   Spider-Man continues to draw new generations into his web and
Stan Lee, the writer who created him with artist Steve Ditko, says
he's not surprised.
   ``They like Spider-Man because they can relate to him,'' Lee
said. ``He has all the problems that they themselves, the readers,
can empathize with.''
   Over the years, Spider-Man starred on television and was
featured on several record albums.
   Lee, now publisher at Marvel and writer of the Spider-Man
newspaper comic strip, is trying to bring Spider-Man to the big
screen.
   ``We're negotiating now,'' he said. ``If we're lucky, it might
reach the theaters by the end of next year.''

   An 83.1-carat, plum-sized emerald should be quite
the plum on the auction block tonight.
   The emerald, nicknamed ``Denise'' after the fiancee of its Los
Angeles owner, is the main attraction of the sale featuring
hundreds of other gemstones and Soviet artwork.
   The sale, expected to bring $10 million, began Sunday and
resumes 7 p.m. today.
   But be prepared: The minimum bid for the emerald is $1.5 million.
   Sandy Reid, executive vice president of Greystone Galleries of
Toronto, said the emerald was retrieved from the famous Muzo Mine
in Colombia, considered the finest emerald mine in the world.
   It is ``the largest ever gotten out of the mine,'' Ms. Reid
said, adding it should fetch at least $3 million. At least two
people already have offered the minimum bid for the gem.
   But what could one do with an emerald that big?
   ``To be real honest with you, I don't know,'' said Shari Arnold,
spokeswoman for Vikki Vines Auctioneer Co. of Houston. ``It's
huge.''

<HEAD>O'Connor Blocks Timber Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice has refused to let
timber companies operate on the 200,000-acre Mapleton Ranger
District of the Siuslaw National Forest in Oregon, it was announced
today.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, without comment, turned down an
emergency request aimed at setting aside a federal appeals court
order that blocks temporarily any timber sales from that district.
   O'Connor's action was taken Friday but not announced until today.
   Lawyers for the Western Forest Industries Association and
various timber companies told O'Connor the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals order ``has shut down the entire timber sale program on
the Mapleton District for the remainder of the fiscal year.''
   The appeals court's July 5 order blocks any sales until that
court studies the controversy more fully.
   The planned timber sales, approved by the U.S. Forest Service,
were challenged by the National Wildlife Federation, the Oregon
Wildlife Federation and the Siuslaw Task Force.
   Timber industry lawyers told O'Connor that the 9th Circuit
court's order ``destroys the careful balance struck by Congress ...
between the critical need for a reliable timber supply for the
Pacific Northwest's timber industry in 1990 and the desire to
protect ecologically significant old growth forests.''

   Fourteen people drowned in flood waters
Sunday, raising the death toll to 65 in a month of flooding that
has also left 2 million homeless, officials said Monday.
   Nine of the weekend casualties were children, relief officials
said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 25 of
Bangladesh's 64 districts have been inundated by monsoon rains and
overflowing rivers.
   Floods also have destroyed crops in this agricultural nation
where most people live below the poverty line.
   The nine children died in the northwestern Sirajganj and Bogra
districts, where flooding has been worst, the officials said. Five
other deaths were reported in Habiganj.
   Low-lying Bangladesh, a nation of river deltas emptying into the
Bay of Bengal, is buffeted by floods every summer. Villages of
mud-and-straw huts can be washed away after a few hours of rain.

<HEAD>One-Quarter of British Youth Have Difficulty Reading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One in four young adults in Britain has difficulty
reading and writing, according to a survey published Monday.
   The survey of 1,000 people ranging in age from 16 to 20 years
old found that 35 percent had difficulties spelling and 43 percent
rarely or never read books. Nine percent rarely or never read
newspapers or magazines, the government-funded Adult Literacy and
Basic Skills Unit reported.
   It said 94 percent of adults with literacy problems had not
received any help since they were 16 years old.
   The survey was commissioned by Director, the monthly magazine of
the Institute of Directors, one of Britain's larest organizations
for business people.
   Director said the survey showed ``an enormous waste of human
resources and an unnecessary burden on the British economy.''
   Last week, Education Secretary John MacGregor announced the
government would investigate the reading abilities of 7-year-olds
after a study by psychologists showed standards slipping back to
levels of 50 years ago.
   Another survey on literacy _ taken among 1,700 16-year-old
pupils at an unidentified college near London _ showed 39 percent
could not spell ``merely'' and that ``bargain'' was a problem for a
quarter of them.
   Only one-quarter could spell ``committee'' and fewer than a half
could manage ``permanent,'' said the report, which is being sent to
the Department of Education.
   The report said the study was based on a spelling test drafted
in the 1950s.
   It said there had been a serious deterioration in the spelling
performance of 16-year-olds in the last half of the 1980s and it
accused education officials of masking the decline by lowering
standards in school examinations.

   A worker on the British side of the Channel Tunnel
being bored between England and France was electrocuted, police
said. His was the ninth death on the project.
   Police said Charles McCourt, 45, died Sunday night, but they
gave no further details.
   The death comes less than three weeks after Transmanche Link,
the Anglo-French construction consortium of 10 companies building
the tunnel, pledged immediate action to improve safety standards.
The move came after Britain's Health and Safety Executive demanded
tighter safety controls.
   There have been seven deaths on the project's British side and
two on the French side as workers dig the 31-mile tunnel.
   Workers are boring three tunnels through the channel, two for
trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel. They are expected to break
through on a first tunnel in November.

<HEAD>Authorities Struggle to Halt Cigarette Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette smuggling is dramatically increasing in
China and authorities in coastal provinces seem unable to deal with
the problem, an official report said Monday.
   In the coastal province of Fujian, authorities handled 50,000
cases of the smuggling of imported cigarettes in the first half of
this year _ four times higher than during the same period last
year, the Economic Daily said.
   Last year an estimated 600,000 to 1 million cases of cigarettes
were smuggled into China, representing a tax loss of $190 million
to $317 million, it said.
   Most male Chinese smoke, and having imported cigarettes is
considered a status symbol. Ordinary Chinese cigarettes sell for
about 20 cents. Imported cigarettes cost six to seven times that
amount.
   Authorities from the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in eastern China
said at a recent meeting that it was difficult to stop smuggling
because of a lack of supervision in coastal provinces.
   Gangs, some with links to Hong Kong and Taiwan, are increasingly
active, pushing out individuals who used to make up the bulk of the
cigarette smuggling trade.
   The new breed of smugglers are also well equipped. For example,
they use 900-1,200 horsepower boats against the government's 40-100
horsepower crafts, the paper said. Some foreign boats are even
equipped with satellite navigation equipment and other
communications facilities, it said.
   Some authorities who confiscate smuggled cigarettes are also
known to sell them rather than turning the goods over to the
authorities, the paper said.

   Torrential rain burst a dam and
caused dozens of homes to collapse in northeastern Brazil, killing
at least 27 people, fire officials said Monday.
   Ten members of one family were buried alive when a mudslide hit
their house on Sunday, fire department Maj. Neyff Souza said by
telephone from Recife, 1,536 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
   ``So far, we know of 24 victims buried under mud or rubble and
three who drowned,'' Souza said. ``But there could be more because
we haven't searched the worst area.''
   A storm dumped 7 inches of rain on greater Recife Saturday night
and Sunday, about one-third the city's average monthly rainfall,
the weather bureau said.
   The rain caused five rivers to overflow in the city, which is
known as ``the Venice of Brazil'' because of its many waterways.
   About 10,000 people were driven from their homes and put up at
schools or temporary civil defense shelters, Souza said. Hardest
hit were the poor shantytowns along riverbanks on the city's north
side, he said.
   In the outlying city of Camaragibe, in greater Recife, a small
dam burst and washed away dozens of homes, he said.
   The weather was dry Monday, and a team of 11 firemen began a
house-to-house search for victims in Camaragibe.

operations in the Philippines last month because of reported rebel
threats against volunteers.
   Brig. Gen. Raymundo Jarque, military commander of Negros, said
he agreed to a temporary ``cessation of hostilities'' and that
troops would not interfere with the release.
   In Manila, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said Swanson
would probably be flown to the capital after his release and later
sent to the United States.
   The Rev. Antonio Fortich, retired Roman Catholic bishop of
Negros island, said the rebels asked for the truce in seven
communities on Negros between Wednesday and Friday.
   Fortich told reporters the two were in good condition and that
Mizuno was spending time playing basketball with his captors.
   Fortich said the letter, the second he received from the rebels,
also contained demands. He refused to elaborate but said they did
not include ransom.
   ``We are now preparing everything that they are demanding,''
Fortich told reporters. ``Unless there is a third letter saying the
release will not take place, it will be all systems go.''
   Bacolod is about 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   The New People's Army, the armed wing of the outlawed Communist
Party of the Philippines, has been waging a 21-year-old insurgency
to establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Connie Chung Won't Do New Series, Wants Baby</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Connie Chung wants to have a baby before it's
too late, so today she removed herself and her new ``Face to Face
With Connie Chung'' interview series from CBS' Monday lineup for
next fall.
   The 43-year-old Chung, who's married to ``A Current Affair''
anchorman Maury Povich, 51, said she will do ``Face to Face''
specials instead of her series.
   CBS will replace Chung's series with ``The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill,'' a one-hour dramatic series starring former ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey'' star Sharon Gless as a recently divorced lawyer who becomes
a public defender.
   Chung, in a statement explaining her decision, said she and her
husband ``have reached an important point in our lives.''
   ``We want very much to have a child,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, time is running out for me when it comes to
childbeairng. I will be 44 next month.
   ``Just last week, after consulting with my doctors, I became
convinced that to make this effort, I now need to take a very
aggressive approach to having a baby.''
   Because of that, she said, she asked CBS News to lighten her
workload. She was unavailable for comment on her decision.
   Earlier this year, Maria Shriver left the Washington-based
``Sunday Today'' show, citing a desire to spend more time with her
baby daughter in Los Angeles, where she lives.
   ``This was a very important decision for Connie,'' CBS Broadcast
Group President Howard Stringer said. ``She has my support, respect
and loyalty.
   ``When Connie is ready we will happily welcome `Face to Face'
back to the schedule as a weekly series.''
   Chung, who rejoined CBS News from NBC in April 1989, and
anchored last-season's low-rated ``Saturday Night with Connie
Chung,'' scored high ratings in May with her first two ``Face to
Face'' specials.
   Her husband recently said he will leave the syndicated ``A
Current Affair'' which he has anchored for Fox Broadcasting since
1986. He intends to co-produce and anchor a new nightly talk series
to be syndicated by Paramount starting in the fall 1991.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bertha, the first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic
season, churned along the Gulf Stream well east of the Carolinas
today after regaining strength temporarily lost during the night.
   Born as a tropical depression off northeast Florida, Bertha grew
quickly Saturday into a minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph. It
dropped below the 74 mph hurricane threshold Sunday night, but
regained hurricane status today after its winds intensified a bit.
   At noon EDT today, Bertha had top sustained winds near 75 mph
and was centered near latitude 35.3 north, longitude 67.4 west, or
675 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia, said forecasters
at the National Hurricane Center near Miami.
   The storm was moving northeast near 13 mph and was expected to
stay at the same strength, course and speed through early Tuesday,
said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   Earlier, Bertha kicked up the surf along Carolina beaches and
sent gusts up to about 45 mph toward Bermuda.
   But forecasters said that because it was already edging
northeastward toward the open Atlantic when it was born, it was
never much of a threat.
   ``It's mainly a concern to marine interests at the present
time,'' forecaster Hal Gerrish said.
   He said Bertha could reach the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland by Wednesday or Thursday.
   Tropical Storm Arthur, which peaked with 70 mph winds Thursday
but quickly lost strength over the central Caribbean, had
dissipated by late Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Local sportsmen are more than
game to help Channel Islands National Park officials hunt down the
estimated 4,000 wild pigs ravaging this island off the southern
California coast.
   But park officials are telling the pig hunters not to get too
fired up.
   Park officials have been deluged with offers of help since last
week, when they announced plans to eliminate the island's wild pig
population so they can restore native wildlife and vegetation.
   ``They'll say, `I want to get on the list,''' said Fred
Rodriguez, a dispatcher for the Park Service. ``They'll say, `How
can I get to the island to kill pigs?'''
   But park officials plan to hire professionals to do the work at
a cost of $200,000 to $800,000.
   Most of the island has been ravaged by pigs digging roots,
eating acorns and plundering bird nests since European settlers
abandoned the animals there in 1850, authorities said.
   Park officials expect the eradication of the pigs on the
53,000-acre island to take about 1{ years.
   Rodriguez said he receives at least 12 calls each day from
hunters offering to do the job for free.
   Among his favorite calls was from a group at a tavern.
   ``You could hear the country-western music in the background,''
he said. ``It was kind of comical, actually. It was something they
thought they could do in one day.''

   Divers searching for treasure from a
Spanish ship that went down in a hurricane in 1715 have found a
perfectly preserved, 1{-foot-high silver bell.
   ``Gold coins are gold coins,'' said ship Capt. Carl Lazzeri,
captain of the Rogue Wave, whose divers made the find. ``Artifacts
are one of a kind. To find something in that good of condition is
really exciting.''
   The four-man crew of the Rogue Wave has been searching since May
for gold, silver and artifacts from what appear to be the remains
of the Santo Cristo de San Roman, one of an 11-ship fleet that sank
during a hurricane after leaving Cuba for Spain. Since the early
1960s, eight of the ships have been found.
   The Rogue Wave is one of about 20 boats subcontracting this
summer with treasure hunter Mel Fisher to search for treasure from
Sebastian Inlet to St. Lucie Inlet on Florida's east-central coast.
   Diver Gary Daemer spotted the bell in 8 feet of water in
Sebastian Inlet on July 23.
   ``Originally, I thought it was a newer bell, something from the
1800s. When we got the encrustation off, then we knew we had
something great,'' Daemer said.
   Dated 1705, the bell bears the Latin inscription ``Soli Deo
Gloria'' or ``Glory to God Alone.'' It was found alongside a small
wooden beam to which it had once been attached.
   Daemer said the bell was probably buried under sand for years,
which would have helped preserve it, and was only recently
uncovered when the sand shifted.

   More than 100 writers endured a 48-hour
type-till-you-drop ``scriptathon'' in a marathon effort to pound
out a movie script in two days.
   The writers from the Independent Writers of Southern California
and a dozen passers-by willing to spend $10 for 10 minutes at a
computer keyboard contributed during the weekend to a screenplay
called ``Hot Property.''
   The play is a romantic comedy about a crazy coot who wants to
bequeath his house, the last affordable one in Los Angeles, to a
deserving young couple.
   ``I think we can auction it to a movie studio or filmmaker,''
said Cheryl Crooks, Independent Writers president. ``We hope to
create the longest line of screenwriting credits in history.'
   ``Everything is possible in Hollywood,'' Crooks said.
   The non-profit Independent Writers counts 450 members, including
freelance journalists, authors, publicists and poets.
   A goal of the event held in a shopping center was to raise money
for inner-city high school students to attend a film workshop at
the University of Southern California's School of Cinema-Television.

   After the Beatles broke up, Paul McCartney hated
being asked: ``Are you happy?''
   But as he closed out his 102-concert world tour Sunday, he said
the question no longer frightens him.
   ``I used to really dread that question,'' McCartney told
reporters before the final stop in the 10-month tour Sunday at
Soldier Field, where he played to a sold-out crowd of 53,000.
   But now, ``I'm really happy. I've got a great family, a great
band, and we seem to be selling some tickets,'' he said.
   McCartney jokingly referred to his ``great venerable age'' of 48
and refuted speculation that this might be his last tour.
   ``I just would like to continue making music,'' the former
Beatle said. ``I want to get better _ that's always been my goal.
If the next album's better than the last one, that's all that
really interests me.''
   McCartney played to a total of 2.8 million people during the
tour.

   Tennis star Jimmy Connors has found a new
racket _ riverboat gambling.
   Connors and his brother, John, are hoping to secure construction
financing for a four-level riverboat that can carry up to 2,500
gamblers. Illinois law says the design of the boat must be a
replica of a 19th-century vessel.
   Nine other partners will be responsible for financing other
portions of the project, John Connor said Monday.
   Construction of the boat won't begin until a license is granted
by the Illinois Gaming Board, and that decision is not expected
until later this year.
   John Connors said the boat would offer a variety of
entertainment besides gambling.
   ``We're not just looking at it as gambling. Some people might
come to the boat to see a show and not gamble,'' he said.
   Although riverboat gambling legally may begin Jan. 1, partner J.
Thomas Long said his group probably would not start until Sept. 1,
1991 _ if they get a license.

   Jeb Magruder, who spent seven months in
prison for his role in Watergate, has been chosen by the First
Presbyterian Church congregation to become its senior pastor.
   ``I think the church in Lexington is a highly intelligent kind
of congregation, full of people ready to deal with substantive
issues of faith and how it relates to their everyday lives as
Christians,'' Magruder said in a telephone interview from his home
in Columbus, Ohio.
   The vote Sunday was 254-5. ``I think that's about as close to a
unanimous vote as any bunch of Presbyterians ever gave a new
minister,'' said the Rev. Victor Priebe, interim minister of the
church founded in 1784.
   Magruder, 55, pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct justice
in the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to President Nixon's
resignation in 1974.
   Magruder graduated from the Princeton School of Divinity after
his release from prison in 1975. He has been executive minister of
First Community Church in Columbus since 1984.

   This tiny community hasn't had an office for the mayor since

   Things have improved since then, and the City Council says
Wilson can have his old office back _ for $215 a month.
   ``You won't find another city hall in the state of West
Virginia, maybe even in the entire United States, that doesn't
furnish its mayor an office,'' said Wilson, 74. ``It is a most
unusual situation, wouldn't you agree?''
   Councilman Earl Delaney, who led the opposition to the mayor,
didn't agree or disagree. He just said the council can't afford to
lose the rent on the office.
   ``This is the first time we've had any troubles with him,''
Delaney added, referring to the mayor.

   Georges Conchon, author of prize-winning novels and
screenwriter for an Oscar-winning film, has died, his family said
today. He was 65.
   The family said he died Sunday in a Paris-area hospital after a
sudden illness. No details were released.
   Conchon mixed a varied literary career with long-term government
service. From 1960 to 1980, he was secretary of debates at the
Senate, the upper chamber of the French Parliament.
   His first novel was published in 1953. His 1959 novel ``La
Corrida de la Victoire'' (The Corrida of Victory) won the Prix des
Libraires and his 1964 novel ``L'Etat Sauvage'' (The Savage State)
won the Prix Goncourt, France's most prestigious literary award.
   He also wrote scripts for several popular French films and was
co-writer of the 1976 film ``Black and White in Color,'' along with
Jean-Jacques Annaud, the director. Winner of the Oscar for best
foreign film, the movie was a satirical depiction of colonial life
in French West Africa in 1915.
   Conchon was a journalist for the newspaper France-Soir in
1959-60 and served as artistic adviser to the national television
channel Antenne 2 after his retirement from the Senate in 1980. He
was a member of the governing Socialist Party.
   Funeral services were pending.

   The White House today condemned the massacre
of more than 200 people by government forces in Liberia as a
``senseless act of terror.'' But it said the United States was not
about to send in any troops.
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said U.S.
embassy officials had confirmed that Liberian troops slaughtered
some 200 people who had sought refuge at a Lutheran Church compound
in Monrovia. Witnesses said most of them were women and children.
   ``We abhor this senseless act of terror and call again on all
sides to the conflict to refrain from inflicting violence on
helpless and innocent men, women and children,'' Hart said.
   He said all parties should respect internationally sanctioned
protections for victims of armed conflict to prevent murder and the
carrying out of executions without due process.
   ``We renew the appeal which we have made both publicly and
privately throughout this tragic conflict for both sides to forego
a military solution and to follow the path of negotiations,'' Hart
said.
   Despite the bloodshed, Hart said the United States was not
committing any troops to Liberia. ``At this point,'' he said, ``we
don't believe that would be a prudent course of action.''
   Rebel forces seeking to overthrow President Samuel Doe were
waging street battles in Monrovia with government forces and have
advanced within a mile of Doe's seaside mansion.
   Hart said the United States remains willing to escort Doe out of
the country but that he has not asked for help in leaving.
   Asked if the United States held Doe accountable for the massacre
committed by his troops, Hart said, ``We don't know who directed
the action. ... Certainly we abhor the action his forces are
taking.''
   About 400 Americans remain in Liberia, including 70 American
officials, said Roman Popadiuk, White House deputy press secretary.

<HEAD>Utah ACLU Files School Prayer Lawsuit Against Two Districts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY GROUTAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union today
filed a lawsuit against two school districts that permit prayer at
graduation exercises and other school functions.
   The ACLU, making good on legal action it had threatened for
several months, named the Alpine and Granite districts and several
administrators in the suit filed in U.S. District Court.
   The action was certain to touch off a legal battle that some,
including Gov. Norm Bangerter, have suggested should be fought with
state funds to ensure prayers would have a place in public schools.
   ``It is with reluctance that the ACLU has sponsored the filing
of these lawsuits, given the shortage of funds available to the
school districts for important programs and teachers salaries,''
ACLU Executive Director Michele Parish-Pixler said at a news
conference.
   ``All of our efforts to resolve these problems out of court have
been rejected. We feel we have no alternative.''
   The plaintiffs include students who have graduated or are
currently students in the two districts and a counselor and teacher
in the Alpine District in Utah County.
   Parish-Pixler said earlier today that prayer in Utah schools
forces minor children into religious practices.
   She said that, although taking such an issue to court is
``always a gamble,'' she felt confident the ACLU's Utah chapter
would prevail.
   The filings culminate a months-long dispute over the practice of
permitting prayer at graduation exercises and other school
functions in Utah, where about 70 percent of its 1.7 million
residents are members of the Mormon Church.
   In the time since graduation exercises marked the school year's
end, the dispute has come to involve the ACLU, school districts,
the Republican governor and a top official of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   The debate began in 1989, when a student at the Jordan School
District complained that a Mormon-oriented prayer at graduation
violated the student's civil rights.
   The Jordan District later banned graduation prayer, but the
issue remained active through the 1990 school year.
   Even so, a majority of Utahns appear to favor prayer at some
school functions, according to a recent poll for The Deseret News
and KSL-TV.
   The survey found that 72 percent of those questioned said they
favored prayer at commencement ceremonies, while 69 percent said
prayers should be permitted in schools. Nineteen percent said
prayer at graduation should be banned, and 26 percent oppose school
prayer.
   Of those who identified themselves as Mormons, 83 percent would
accept prayer in the schools, while Protestants and Catholics were
split on the issue. By political party, 76 percent of the
Republicans favored school prayer, as opposed to 58 percent of the
Democrats.
   Bangerter has said he would ask the Legislature to appropriate
money to help the districts battle the lawsuit, although House
Speaker Nolan Karras, R-Roy, has said he would want to study the
matter before committing state money to a costly and potentially
fruitless proposition.
   In a Sunday editorial, the church-owned Deseret News supported
Bangerter's intention, saying that otherwise the school districts
would be forced to bear the burden of costly litigation.
   The newspaper also drew a distinction between school prayer and
those at graduation exercises, where most graduates and visitors
are legal adults and where even those of faiths different from that
of the person praying would ``hardly suffer psychological damage.''
   The Salt Lake Tribune, however, opposes both school prayer and
spending state money to defend it and planned an editorial for
Tuesday's editions, said editorial writer Diane Cole.

<HEAD>East Germany Agrees To Pay Israel Compensation for Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has reversed its position and
agreed to pay Israel compensation for taking in thousands of
refugees from Nazi Germany after World War II, according to a
letter obtained Monday.
   The change was reflected in a letter from East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere to World Jewish Congress President
Edgar Bronfman which said that talks should be convened to discuss
compensation for ``the burden caused to Israel with the absorption
and integration of refugees from Germany....''
   Previously, East Germany had agreed to pay reparations to Jewish
organizations but not to Israel.
   Even with the change, East Germany cannot afford the large sum
of money involved, and negotiations about the amount probably will
take place next year after the East is united with wealthy West
Germany, officials said. The united Germany will assume the
financial responsibilities of the East once unification is
completed by the end of this year.
   Talks on the subject between Israeli and East German officials
broke down in Copenhagen on July 5 on the issue of reparations to
Israel for absorption of the refugees, according to the Israel
Foreign Ministry.
   At Israel's request, the World Jewish Congress then intervened
with the office of de Maiziere, said WJC Executive Director Elan
Steinberg.
   The letter from de Maiziere, said Steinberg, ``emerges as the
voice of Germany's moral conscience.''
   He said Israel and the WJC wanted an East German commitment of
principle on the reparations, although talks on the sum to be
repaid probably would not take place until after the union of East
and West Germany.
   Israel has demanded an East German commitment to pay reparations
based on a formula reached with West Germany in 1952 known as the
Luxembourg Agreement.
   The agreement called for total reparations of 4.5 billion
Deutsche Marks to be paid to Israel and Jewish organizations for
the costs of resettling destitute survivors of the Nazi Holocaust
in which 6 million Jews were killed.
   West Germany agreed to pay 3 billion of the total, and said East
Germany would pay the other 1.5 billion.
   However, East Germany was under the control of the Soviets
following World War II and refused to recognize responsibility for
the Holocaust.
   Soon after throwing off communist rule in March, however, East
Germany announced it would accept moral responsibility for the
crimes of the Nazis. It also agreed to compensate Jewish
organizations.
   Talks on those reparations, which began last month, have stalled
pending resolution of the question of whether there should be
compensation to Israel in addition to the Jewish organizations,
Jewish sources said.
   The East Germans have now decided to compensate Israel. Only the
amount to be paid has not yet been resolved.

<HEAD>Latvian Officials Meet with Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Foreign Minister's name to ``Jurkns.''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latvian Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis and his
foreign minister called on President Bush today and said they
received encouragement in their quest for a gradual transition to
independence from the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Minister Janis Jurkns said he and Godmanis told Bush
that ``some countries in Europe have taken concrete steps'' to
recognize Latvian independence.
   ``We asked the American government to do the same and we got
supportive answers,'' Jurkns said.
   Godmanis added, however, that Latvia would seek its independence
``democratically, peacefully and gradually.''
   ``We want to restore our independence 100 per cent,'' he said.
``There is no question.''
   But, he said, ``independence will be gradual; it takes time.''
   Godmanis said he asked Bush to open a U.S. information center in
the Latvian capital of Riga, to encourage American firms to do
business in Latvia and to support American universities offering
education for Latvian youth.
   ``Mr. Bush said they are going to speak very seriously about
what they can do in those specific directions,'' he said.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Stephen Hart said that during
the meeting with Godmanis ``the president heard his concerns and
the plans of the Latvian government for economic reform.''
   `` I am not aware of any commitments that were made,'' Hart said.
   Roman Popadiuk, also a deputy White House press secretary, said
that in administration policy ``the emphasis has been in urging
dialogue'' between the Soviet Union and the Baltic Republics.

<HEAD>Hrawi Government Imposes Blockade on Aoun Enclave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi's government on
Monday clamped an economic and diplomatic blockade on rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun in an attempt to oust him from the Christian enclave
north of Beirut.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, immediately expressed
support for the move. Aoun has demanded the withdrawal of the
40,000 troops Syria maintains in Lebanon.
   Also Monday, rival Shiite militiamen fought artillery duels in
south Lebanon, leaving six dead and 24 wounded. The Red Cross said
it was preparing a mission to evacuate bodies from earlier clashes.
   The fighting was between the Iranian-backed fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-allied Amal militia in
the Apple Province.
   The casualties raised the toll to 186 people killed and 560
wounded since July 16, when renewed fighting broke out in the
three-year intermittent war for dominance of the 1.2 million-strong
Shiite sect, the largest in Lebanon.
   By police count, 1,232 people have been killed and 4,203 wounded
in the inconclusive power struggle.
   The government directive instructed military checkpoints at all
gateways into Aoun-controlled areas to prohibit the passage of fuel
tankers and trucks carrying ammunition or spare parts to Aoun's
19,000 troops.
   The directive also banned civilians entering Aoun-controlled
territory from carrying more than $150, and prohibited money
transfers to banks operating in his area.
   The Foreign Ministry in mostly Moslem west Beirut called in
diplomatic representatives Monday and notified them that it will
not tolerate any contacts between foreign representatives and Aoun.
   A government statement said the blockade was ``an initial move
to end Aoun's mutiny'' and that if it failed to accomplish its
objective, a food blockade would be imposed after two weeks.
   Aoun, who controls roughly 20 percent of the Christian enclave,
denounced Hrawi's blockade as an ``attempt to starve out the
people.''
   Analysts say the effectiveness of the blockade depends largely
on how far Syria is willing to go in supporting Hrawi's drive to
re-establish the state authority that has been eroded by 15 years
of civil war.
   Jibran Kourieh, a spokesman for Syrian President Hafaz Assad,
said Assad had pledged to Lebanese Christian leaders that Syria
would ``fully support'' efforts to extend the Hrawi government's
authority to all of Lebanon.
   The U.S. ambassador to Syria, Edward Djerejian, told a news
conference that Syria and the United States both supported the
Hrawi government.
   Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1976 under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to end the civil war. They control 70 percent of the
country's territory and ring the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Aoun, 54, controls the enclave's Metn province. He contends that
a military cabinet he headed since September 1988 is the only
legitimate government in Lebanon.
   The rest of the enclave, including all its sea outlets, is
controlled by Christian warlord Samir Geagea and his Lebanese
Forces militia, which has declared allegiance to Hrawi.
   The enclave was partitioned after an inconclusive confrontation
between Aoun and Geagea that erupted Jan. 30, killing at least
1,044 people and wounding 2,793.
   Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24 with strong Syrian backing
to enforce a peace accord worked out by Lebanon's Parliament. The
agreement would end Christian dominance in Lebanon and give
Moslems, who make up 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million population,
an equal share of power. Aoun has objected to the accord saying it
does not include a timetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal from
Lebanon.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Catholics, the sect that has
dominated the government since Lebanon gained independence from
France in 1943.

   Personal spending rose 1.0 percent in June,
the strongest gain in five months, the government said Monday in a
report suggesting that consumers are keeping the nation's weak
economy alive.
   ``This seems to indicate the consumer is not dead,'' said Mark
M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa. ``As long as the consumer hangs in there, I believe we
will avoid a recession.''
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.64 trillion, the biggest jump
since a similar 1.0 percent gain last January.
   ``This does not indicate we're going into an economic
recession,'' agreed Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with the Norwest
Corp. in Minneapolis. He noted that consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Consumer spending had been a source of concern in recent months.
Spending rose just 0.2 percent in February and April and 0.3
percent in March. Spending was unchanged in May.
   As measured in the gross national product, the nation's total
output of goods and services, second-quarter personal spending
actually fell 0.3 percent.
   But Sohn said the June personal consumption figure, which
includes everything except interest payments on debt, indicates
third-quarter spending will be a source of strength for the economy.
   The Commerce Department also said personal incomes rose 0.4
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.64 trillion
after 0.3 percent gains in April and May.
   But the higher spending level resulted in a drop in Americans'
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of disposable income _ to
4.9 percent. It had been 5.4 percent in May and 5.1 percent in
April.
   A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital
since funds thus would be available domestically for business
investment.
   All of Monday's figures reflected major changes in last year's
numbers as a result of the Commerce Department's annual revision
announced last week. The biggest change involved the department's
$57.9 billion overestimate in wages and salaries, which resulted in
lowering the 1989 savings rate from 5.4 percent to 4.6 percent.
   Americans' income after taxes increased 0.5 percent, up from a
0.3 percent gain a month earlier. Wages and salaries rose $13.0
billion in June after a $10.1 billion increase in May.
   Personal consumption rose $34.5 billion, including a $9.6
billion gain in spending on durable goods _ items expected to last
more than three years. This included a robust $6.1 billion rebound
in automobile sales, which had been sluggish for much of the year.
   Spending on non-durable goods rose $8.2 billion, the first
advance since February. Spending for services increased $16.7
billion, the largest jump since a $20.4 billion advance in March.

   The United States has no plans to send
military forces to Trinidad, where Prime Minister Arthur Robinson
and more than 30 others are being held hostage by Moslem rebels,
the State Department said today.
   At the same time, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher criticized
Libya's involvement with the rebels, saying it has provided some
training for the insurgents. But he said there was no apparent
direct link between Libya and the hostage-taking, which occurred
last Friday.
   Boucher refused comment on reports that U.S. military assets
were being deployed in the vicinity of Trinidad but said ``there
are no plans for U.S. military intervention.''
   The USS Roosevelt paid a scheduled visit to Port-of-Spain July
20-23, the Navy said. The carrier is now in port in Norfolk. The
Navy has 10 ships in the Caribbean on what the Navy calls ``routine
exercises.''
   Boucher said there have been no reports of injury to the
estimated 6,000 Americans living in Trinidad.
   President Bush was keeping up to date on developments after
returning to Washington late Sunday after a weekend at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We fully support the government of Prime Minister (Arthur)
Robinson and hope for a peaceful solution to the situation there,''
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   U.S. officials said any direct U.S. role had been all but ruled
out. Even sending U.S. experts on hostage negotiations _ discussed
informally on Saturday between the United States and
representatives of the Trinidad government _ had been ruled out,
sources said.
   ``The Trinidadians would like to find a solution on their own
without any outside assistance. They'd just rather settle it
themselves,'' the official said.
   The administration has hailed Trinidad's government as a model
of democracy, and the attempted coup was viewed with distress in
Washington.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
late Friday by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and
capturing Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Angus Khan, the ambassador from Trinidad and Tobago to the
United States, said the negotiations between his government and the
``terrorists over the release of the hostages are very delicate.''
He refused to say more.

<HEAD>Story with Hemingway Twist Ends Life of Old Japanese Fisherman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly Japanese fisherman featured in a
documentary akin to Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea''
has died in what may have been a last fight with a big marlin, the
filmmaker said Monday.
   The body of Shigeru Itokazu, 81, was found Sunday floating in
the East China Sea off a small island south of Okinawa in the
Ryukyu Islands. Itokazu was found near the skiff in which he fished
alone, police in Okinawa said.
   Other fishermen in the area did not see what happened, but a
wound on Itokazu's thumb apparently came from a suddenly tautened
fishing line and indicated he was pulled into the sea, probably by
a marlin, said John Junkerman, an American documentary filmmaker.
   ``The line goes out very fast, and can whip around in the air.
It apparently pulled him into the sea,'' Junkerman said.
   Junkerman, a Milwaukee native who divides his time between homes
in Boston and Japan, spent most of two years filming Itokazu and
life on the remote island of Yonaguni. His film, titled in Japanese
``The Old Man and the Sea,'' was released last month in Okinawa.
   ``It is very ironic and very unfortunate that Mr. Itokazu had
his end this way and so soon after the film was finished,''
Junkerman said.
   The filmmaker spoke from Yonaguni island, where he flew from
Tokyo to join mourners at Itokazu's funeral Monday.
   Itokazu fished from his dugout-like 22-foot skiff, Junkerman
said. ``On shore, it was clear he was an 80-year-old man, but when
he was out at sea, it seemed he was 20 years younger. The sea
really was his element. He loved it.''
   Junkerman, who made the film for a Japanese production company,
said he didn't start out with the idea of mimicking the Hemingway
story. But last year there were no marlin to be caught and the
filming developed into something like the novel about an old
fisherman who hadn't caught a fish in 84 days.
   Hemingway's old man, fishing alone in the Gulf of Mexico, hooks
a swordfish longer than his skiff. He manages to subdue the huge
fish and tie it to his boat, but sharks tear it to pieces before he
can get it to land.
   Itokazu often said ``it's not very difficult to catch a marlin
but the thing one has to do is take your time and catch the fish
carefully,'' Junkerman recalled.
   ``He very much respected the strength and danger of the
marlin,'' he said.
   Marlin fishing was good this year and Itokazu was out looking
for the large, slender billfish when he died, Junkerman said.

<TEXT>
   Five colleges are hatching plans to help revamp
neighboring public schools this fall _ and each say they are
drawing lessons from Boston University's unprecedented management
takeover of a nearby district.
   No one is rushing to imitate Boston University's year-old,
ambitious effort to manage and radically transform the entire
school district of Chelsea, Mass., a nearly broke system of 3,500
students with some of the worst test scores in that state.
   But the university's 10-year plan to manage Chelsea's day-to-day
operations and raise tens of millions of dollars to finance reforms
is apparently earning national credence as colleges seek ways to
nurture school reform.
   ``I think the very positive impact of the Boston-Chelsea
relationship has been to encourage colleges to become more involved
than they have been. But I don't think the model of taking a system
over will be the way it goes,'' said Robert Atwell, president of
the American Council on Education in Washington.
   ``The focus is not so much on the model as on the results,''
said Peter Greer, dean of BU's school of education.
   The point of BU's effort is to show that ``if you want to change
education, you have to take a comprehensive approach,'' he said.
   The BU-Chelsea plan, entering its second year this fall, aims to
rebuild dilapidated schools, raise teacher salaries, introduce
literacy and prenatal care programs, and boost standardized test
scores.
   So far, however, BU has fallen short of fund-raising goals and
is battling the local teacher union. And some in Chelsea still see
the university as an invader imposing change.
   Despite those struggles, officials of at least five colleges
interested in helping nearby schools have recently contacted or
visited BU to learn what works and what doesn't, college and public
school district officials said in interviews.
   _ George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va., is in early talks
that could lead to a contract to help transform the nearby Manassas
Park school district. Manassas Park superintendent James Moyers
said Monday that the rural, financially pressed district hopes to
enter a comprehensive partnership with George Mason, IBM, the city
of Manassas Park and the Signal Hill Development Corp. to stock
classrooms with computers to revolutionize the way children learn
and teachers teach.
   _ Officials of Glassboro State College, in Glassboro, N.J.,
General Electric and the Camden public schools are visiting Boston
this week ``to find out what works and what doesn't'' in the
Chelsea program, said Phil Tumminia, a vice president of Glassboro
State.
   Glassboro State received an $18,500 GE grant this month to draft
plans to improve Camden's schools, concentrating on better teacher
training.
   _ Duke University, in Durham, N.C., plans close ties with Durham
High School this fall, and the BU-Chelsea experiment was one of
several models planners examined, said Duke spokeswoman Janet San
Filippo.
   Under plans hatched last spring, Duke will start programs to get
parents more involved in schools, identify and teach gifted
minority children who may not perform well on standardized tests,
and train college students as tutors.
   _ Mercyhurt College, in Erie, Pa., will hold classes on campus
for some 200 gifted Erie pupils from kindergarten through eighth
grade starting this fall, said president William Garvey.
   _ DePauw University, in rural Greencastle, Ind., may send
student teachers to Chelsea to expose them to inner city,
multicultural classes, said president Robert Bottoms.
   In each case, officials said BU's management scheme with Chelsea
was far too ambitious financially and otherwise for most colleges.
   Public school officials, for their part, stressed that they had
no desire to be taken over by a college or repeat the often-stormy
relationship in Chelsea.
   ``We are not putting ourselves up as experts in secondary school
education. We want to listen to them,'' said San Filippo of Duke.
   ``We don't want to go into this with any sense that we have a
plan we're going to impose,'' agreed Tumminia of Glassboro State.
   Moyers, of Manassas Park, said that at one point George Mason
officials wanted a say in naming certain school district
administrators.
   ``The school board was having none of that,'' Moyers said.
   Another lesson being drawn from the BU experience is the need to
let public schools take the initiative. All five colleges stressed
that they wanted relationships based on cooperation and shared
knowledge.
   Erie school officials ``are telling us what they want from us,''
Garvey said.
   The problems BU experienced in its relationship with Chelsea
``didn't bother us,'' said Erie schools superintendent Joseph
Rodriguez. ``No one will dictate to anyone.''

Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David Souter, as New
Hampshire's attorney general, opposed an order that the state pay
for Medicaid abortions.
   In its 1976 brief, the state referred to abortion as ``the
killing of unborn children.''
   The brief was filed during a federal court appeal of a case
begun during the tenure of Souter's predecessor, Warren Rudman, and
Souter did not personally argue the case. New Hampshire's attorney
general is appointed by the governor and required by law to
represent the governor's views in court. New Hampshire's governor
at the time was arch-conservative Meldrim Thompson.
   Souter's name was listed on the brief but it was signed by its
author, Richard Wiesbusch, then an assistant attorney general.
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said he did not
know if Bush had been told about the 1976 brief. ``What's important
is the president supports his nominee,'' Hart said. ``There were no
specific issues queried about nor was there a litmus test in the
nomination of Souter. ... What's important is that he (Bush) chose
the man based upon his merits, what he thought was important.''
   Bush, in an address to the Youth Leadership Coalition, said
today, ``I am very happy with the way the choice has been received
across the country.''
   ``It is moving in the proper direction and I probably won't have
too much more to say about it,'' the president said.
   Although nothing in the brief sheds any light on Souter's
personal views on abortion, the case likely will provide Senate
Judiciary Committee members eager to learn those views a vehicle to
raise the issue.
   ``Clearly the Senate should ask Judge Souter to address himself
to this document at his confirmation hearings,'' said Arthur J.
Kropp, president of the liberal activist group People for the
American Way, which today distributed copies of papers filed in the
1976 case.
   New Hampshire was appealing to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals a lower court injunction that it pay for elective abortions
sought by Medicaid patients during the resolution of a larger case
in which the state was seeking to prove it didn't have to pay.
   New Hampshire's brief acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion but argued that nothing in
that landmark ruling required the state to use tax dollars to pay
for abortions sought by Medicaid recipients for reasons other than
to preserve a pregnant woman's life.
   ``Many thousands of New Hampshire residents find the use of tax
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally
repugnant,'' the state's brief said.

   An exhibit of works by van Gogh
drew a record 1.2 million visitors over a four-month period,
organizers said Monday. People camped out through the weekend in
hopes of seeing the show before it closed.
   The ``Vincent van Gogh Retrospective'' offered an unprecedented
collection of masterpieces from museums and private collections
around the world. It closed Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the
Dutch artist's death.
   Nearly 140 paintings were on show in Amsterdam's Vincent van
Gogh Museum, which houses the world's largest van Gogh collection.
Simultaneously, 248 drawings were on display at the Kroeller
Mueller Museum in Otterlo, about 55 miles east of Amsterdam.
   ``They are the ones he would have shown if he ever had given an
exhibition,'' said Lisbeth Heenk, a spokeswoman for the Kroeller
Mueller museum.
   She said the number of visitors broke records for Dutch museum
exhibits as well as van Gogh exhibits in other countries.
   No security problems or incidents were reported. Security was a
serious concern in light of a series of major thefts and vandalism
in recent years.
   The works borrowed for the retrospective were reportedly insured
for a total of $3.3 billion. Dutch museums do not insure their own
works.
   Among the most famous paintings on display were ``Starry
Night,'' ``The Bedroom,'' and ``The Potato Eaters.'' Not on display
were ``Irisis'' and ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' which have been
bought at auction for record prices.

<TEXT>
   Four Zambians imprisoned for life for
plotting to overthrow the president in 1980 were freed Monday on
his orders.
   Their release marked the latest in a series of political reforms
made by President Kenneth Kaunda in the past month, since the
country's bloodiest anti-government riots left at least 26 people
dead.
   Released were former High Court commissioner Edward Shamwana,
former general manager of the state Industrial Finance Company
Goodwin Yoram Mumba, Zairean politician Deogratis Symba and driver
Chilambe Chimbalile.
   Shamwana, a former Kaunda aide, acknowledged that he had plotted
the coup, and said he had no regrets.
   ``The reason is I believed there was no other way to change
things,'' Shamwana, 57, told a news conference. The ruling party
``does not allow fresh ideas or initiatives,'' he added.
   ``I believe it is time for people with fresh ideas, a new period
of wonderful opportunity,'' he said.
   Shamwana said in the early days of imprisonment he was tortured,
ill-fed and at one stage stripped naked in a cell ankle-deep in
human waste.
   He originally was sentenced to death, but Kaunda commuted that
to life imprisonment two years ago.
   A fifth plotter, businessman Thomas Mulewa Mupunga, died in
prison in 1987 of what the government said was natural causes.
   A Home Affairs Ministry statement, announcing the releases,
hailed the move as a ``momentous occasion'' in Zambia's history.
   ``The release signifies a victory for the forces of love and
forgiveness under the philosophy of humanism,'' the statement said.
   They were freed at a ceremony attended by officials of the
ruling United National Independence Party and church leaders, the
statement said.
   Reporters were excluded.
   Since the anti-government riots in June, Kaunda, a 67-year-old
onetime schoolteacher, has announced a referendum next year for
Zambians to decide whether they want a return to a multiparty state.
   Kaunda, who led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence as Zambia in 1964, outlawed political opposition 17
years ago, arguing that Western-style democracy in Africa whipped
up tribal hostilities
   Under further pressure for change, Kaunda also has announced he
would free all political prisoners, release more than 1,000 people
arrested during the riots, lifted a dusk-to-dawn curfew and has not
made any move against a pro-democracy movement forming with former
politicians and civil servants, wealthy businessmen and trade union
leaders.

<HEAD>University Offering Bagpipe Music Major</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Carnegie Mellon University hopes to
``legitimize'' the bagpipe by offering a major in the shrill-toned
reed instrument.
   The program, with two students, will begin in the university's
music department this fall.
   Sophomore Vince Mulhern, who used to major in mechanical
engineering, recently applied for one of the two slots.
   ``When my friends hear about this, they laugh, but no one has
said to me I'm crazy,'' he said. ``Of course I don't know what they
say behind my back.''
   ``I was getting tired of engineering and this is intriguing,''
said Mulhern, a bagpiper for two years.
   The new program would be music to the ears of Andrew Carnegie,
the Scottish immigrant who became a steel baron and founded the
school. The bagpipe is played mainly in Scotland.
   ``We think we'll be able to legitimize the instrument, which
when you think about it has been around a lot longer than some we
use in orchestras,'' said Marilyn Taft Thomas, head of the music
department.
   James McIntosh, who has taught the instrument informally at the
university for six years, will head the new program.
   McIntosh said student bagpipers will devote little time to the
folksy tunes most often heard in parades.
   They would concentrate on classical music and, like all other
music performance majors, play the piano.
   ``Apart from anything else, they will leave here qualified to be
music teachers and, I think, will find there are good opportunities
to teach the bagpipe in high schools,'' McIntosh said. ``I know
there are schools who would like to have that but can't find anyone
qualified to teach it.''

   The Soviet Union and Albania today agreed to
normalize relations that were broken off 29 years ago during
Moscow's split with China, the Tass news agency reported.
   The agreement to re-establish ties and reopen embassies in
Moscow and Tirana was reached during talks that were held in
Bulgaria in June and in Tirana today, Tass said.
   The Soviet delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Kvitsinsky, Tass reported.
   Both sides were guided ``by a mutual desire to develop the
relations of friendship and cooperation on the basis of
sovereignty, equality and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs,'' the Tass dispatch said.
   Moscow and Tirana pledged to expand contacts in the political,
economic, scientific, technical and cultural areas, it added.
   Last week, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov had said Moscow was seeking to restore diplomatic
relations with Albania, Europe's last bastion of Stalinism.
   Albania broke off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in
1961 as a result of the Kremlin's split with China, which then
became Albania's chief Communist ally.
   Albania left the Warsaw Pact in 1968 after the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   The Balkan nation then broke with China in 1978 and established
a course fiercely independent of both military blocs. It prided
itself on being self-reliant and claimed to be the only country
practicing true communism.
   Albania also has no relations with the United States.
   It has vowed to resist the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern
Europe, and still reveres the late Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Even
more important is Communist Albania's founding father, Enver Hoxha,
who died in 1985.
   But in recent weeks, Albanian citizens demanding change forced
their way into foreign embassies in Tirana and were allowed to
leave the country.

<TEXT>
   NEWMARKET-ON-FERGUS, Ireland (AP) _ The European Community's
agriculture commissioner on Monday proposed a 30 percent cut in
farm subsidies over a 10-year period in an effort to end a dispute
that threatens global trade talks.
   Ray MacSharry made the surprise proposal at a private meeting
with the agriculture ministers of the United States, Japan, Canada
and Australia.
   ``This is the first time the community has put a specific figure
on the table,'' said European Commission spokesman John Cooney.
   The U.S. delegation reacted coolly. It said it would be
inappropriate to negotiate a proposal outside ongoing talks
involving the nations of GATT, or the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
   ``This is not a place to cut deals,'' said Kelly Shipp, a
spokeswoman for U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who
attended the meeting with MacSharry. The delegations from Japan,
Canada, and Australia agreed with the United States, she said. All
are members of GATT.
   The United States and 14 other farm exporting countries want the
12-nation European Community to end its export credits system and
cut direct subsidies for farmers.
   The dispute is threatening the successful conclusion of the GATT
talks on global trade liberalization. However, the U.S. and EC
teams expressed confidence an overall GATT agreement would be
reached in December.
   The so-called ``Quint'' meeting of the world's most powerful
agriculture ministers was called by MacSharry and held at Dromoland
Castle, about five miles outside Shannon in western Ireland.
   Several hundred Irish farmers, who depend heavily on EC aid,
demonstrated outside the meeting. ``No GATT Sellout'' was their
slogan.
   The other agriculture ministers gathered in Ireland were Japan's
Tomio Yamamoto, Australia's John Kerins, and Canada's Donald
Mazankowski.
   The five senior agriculture officials were assessing
developments since the Group of Seven summit in Houston in
mid-July, when the industrial world's leaders spurred efforts to
cut farm supports.
   MacSharry proposed cutting all European farm support by 30
percent between 1986 and 1996.
   The offer includes cuts that already have been implemented,
Cooney said. He cited reductions of 10 percent in support for crops
and a 15 percent cut in livestock support.
   ``It certainly is a substantive one (proposal). It can't be
considered flippant,'' Cooney said.
   The proposal will be presented to the European Commission in
September. The Commission would have to approve it before it could
be considered at GATT, he said.
   GATT negotiators are to meet again in Geneva in late August.
They agreed at a meeting last week to compile lists and costs of
their farm support by Oct. 1.
   The developed world's farm subsidies cost consumers and
taxpayers $245 billion last year, according to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

   Five colleges are hatching plans to help revamp
neighboring public schools this fall _ and each say they are
drawing lessons from Boston University's unprecedented management
takeover of a nearby district.
   No one is rushing to imitate Boston University's year-old,
ambitious effort to manage and radically transform the entire
school district of Chelsea, Mass., a nearly broke system of 3,500
students with some of the worst test scores in that state.
   But the university's 10-year plan to manage Chelsea's day-to-day
operations and raise tens of millions of dollars to finance reforms
is apparently earning national credence as colleges seek ways to
nurture school reform.
   ``I think the very positive impact of the Boston-Chelsea
relationship has been to encourage colleges to become more involved
than they have been. But I don't think the model of taking a system
over will be the way it goes,'' said Robert Atwell, president of
the American Council on Education in Washington.
   ``The focus is not so much on the model as on the results,''
said Peter Greer, dean of BU's school of education.
   The point of BU's effort is to show that ``if you want to change
education, you have to take a comprehensive approach,'' he said.
   The BU-Chelsea plan, entering its second year this fall, aims to
rebuild dilapidated schools, raise teacher salaries, introduce
literacy and prenatal care programs, and boost standardized test
scores.
   So far, however, BU has fallen short of fund-raising goals and
is battling the local teacher union. And some in Chelsea still see
the university as an invader imposing change.
   Despite those struggles, officials of at least five colleges
interested in helping nearby schools have recently contacted or
visited BU to learn what works and what doesn't, college and public
school district officials said in interviews.
   _ George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va., is in early talks
that could lead to a contract to help transform the nearby Manassas
Park school district. Manassas Park superintendent James Moyers
said Monday that the rural, financially pressed district hopes to
enter a comprehensive partnership with George Mason, IBM, the city
of Manassas Park and the Signal Hill Development Corp. to stock
classrooms with computers to revolutionize the way children learn
and teachers teach.
   _ Officials of Glassboro State College, in Glassboro, N.J.,
General Electric and the Camden public schools are visiting Boston
this week ``to find out what works and what doesn't'' in the
Chelsea program, said Phil Tumminia, a vice president of Glassboro
State.
   Glassboro State received an $18,500 GE grant this month to draft
plans to improve Camden's schools, concentrating on better teacher
training.
   _ Duke University, in Durham, N.C., plans close ties with Durham
High School this fall, and the BU-Chelsea experiment was one of
several models planners examined, said Duke spokeswoman Janet San
Filippo.
   Under plans hatched last spring, Duke will start programs to get
parents more involved in schools, identify and teach gifted
minority children who may not perform well on standardized tests,
and train college students as tutors.
   _ Mercyhurst College, in Erie, Pa., will hold classes on campus
for some 200 gifted Erie pupils from kindergarten through eighth
grade starting this fall, said president William Garvey.
   _ DePauw University, in rural Greencastle, Ind., may send
student teachers to Chelsea to expose them to inner city,
multicultural classes, said president Robert Bottoms.
   In each case, officials said BU's management scheme with Chelsea
was far too ambitious financially and otherwise for most colleges.
   Public school officials, for their part, stressed that they had
no desire to be taken over by a college or repeat the often-stormy
relationship in Chelsea.
   ``We are not putting ourselves up as experts in secondary school
education. We want to listen to them,'' said San Filippo of Duke.
   ``We don't want to go into this with any sense that we have a
plan we're going to impose,'' agreed Tumminia of Glassboro State.
   Moyers, of Manassas Park, said that at one point George Mason
officials wanted a say in naming certain school district
administrators.
   ``The school board was having none of that,'' Moyers said.
   Another lesson being drawn from the BU experience is the need to
let public schools take the initiative. All five colleges stressed
that they wanted relationships based on cooperation and shared
knowledge.
   Erie school officials ``are telling us what they want from us,''
Garvey said.
   The problems BU experienced in its relationship with Chelsea
``didn't bother us,'' said Erie schools superintendent Joseph
Rodriguez. ``No one will dictate to anyone.''

   The Soviet Union and Albania agreed Monday to end
their nearly three-decade estrangement by restoring diplomatic
relations that were severed over the Kremlin's ideological quarrel
with China.
   The agreement to re-establish ties and reopen embassies was
reached during talks that were held in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June
29-30 and in Tirana, the Albanian capital, on Monday, the official
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The decision markep by Albania, Europe's last
bastion of hard-line Communism, to emerge from its long postwar
isolation.
   Fed the latest stor nearly 25 years, the Soviet Union has been making
overtures
to Albania to normalize relations that Albania broke off in 1961
during Moscow's split with China, then an Albanian ally.
   Kremlin leaders, however, could not overcome the deep distrust
of the Soviets that was instilled by Communist Albania's founding
father, Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985.
   The Tass dispatch, which was also was read on Soviet television
and radio, said the Soviet Union and Albania were guided in their
decision to re-establish ties ``by a mutual desire to develop the
relations of friendship and cooperation on the basis of
sovereignty, equality and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.''
   Moscow and Tirana pledged to o foreign embassies in Tirana and were
allowed to leave the
country.
   In May, Alia met with the first official U.S. delegation in
Tirana since World War II and said he wants to re-establish
diplomatic relations with Washington as soon as possible.
U.S.-Albanian relations were broken off in 1946.
   Also in May, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
visited Tirana and told his hosts that the world welcomed Albania's
decision to embark on economic and social reforms.
   In March 1989, Albania sent its first official delegation to
China since their break in relations.

<HEAD>Survey Finds States Can Lose Money Trying to Raise Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's hardly surprising, but a survey has found
that people will go to great lengths to avoid taxes, even crossing
state lines to pay lower sales and excise taxes.
   The American Legislative Exchange Council, a national bipartisan
organization of state lawmakers, commissioned Price Waterhouse to
do the survey to find out how much states ultimately pay by
charging higher taxes.
   The survey looked at two pairs of states with pronounced
differences in their taxes: Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and
Indiana and Illinois.
   It concluded that New Hampshire enjoys most of the economic
benefits in the phenomenon it calls ``cross-border activity.''
   For the two Midwestern states there was more give and take,
though overall, Indiana came out ahead. Indiana benefits at
Illinois' expense from favorable cross-state line trade in tobacco
and gasoline; Illinois benefits in the sale of wine and liquor.
   The survey was released Friday at the group's annual meeting
here, where 1,500 participants gathered from Thursday until Sunday.
   The findings are no surprise, but they suggest that lawmakers
need to change their perspective when they set out to raise taxes,
said economist Paul Lawrence, author of the survey report.
   ``Under certain circumstances ... the borders of the states, in
terms of the taxpayers, are not geographic borders,'' Lawrence said
in a telephone call from an office in Springfield, Va.
   ``Politicians tend not to think about neighboring states. But
when people in Massachusetts raise their taxes to raise revenue,
people in New Hampshire end up raising money.''
   The commodities surveyed were gasoline, wine and liquor, and
tobacco. The years examined were 1975 to 1988.
   Massachusetts has a sales tax of 5 percent; New Hampshire has
none. In 1988, New Hampshire's excise tax on a cigarette carton was
$1.70. In Massachusetts it was $2.60. New Hampshire owns all liquor
wholesale and retail businesses, keeping the revenue and selling
the alcohol at lower prices than those found in Massachusetts.
   Based on these figures and others, the survey reckoned:
   _ The average annual economic benefits for New Hampshire came to
$22.4 million from added tax revenue; $104.2 million in added
retail sales, and 796 jobs earning $8.6 million.
   _ The cost to Massachusetts was an annual loss of 13 percent of
cigarette sales and 7.2 percent of annual wine and liquor sales
because Massachusetts residents bought those goods in New Hampshire.
   In Illinois, fuel taxes came to 21 cents a gallon compared with
18 cents a gallon in Indiana. The tax on wine in Illinois was an
estimated $1.13 a gallon compared to $1.47 a gallon in Indiana.
Liquor taxes in Illinois were $3.80 a gallon against $4.68 in
Indiana. A carton of cigarettes in Illinois came with a tax of
$2.72; Indiana taxes on a carton were $2.10.
   Overall the boon to Indiana totaled $58.8 million in sales and
excise taxes, $311.6 million in retail sales, and 1,996 jobs paying
$22.5 million.
   The losses to Illinois came to $69.7 million in potential sales
and excise taxes, $376.8 million in potential retail sales, and the
loss of 2,949 jobs earning $31 million.

   Inside trader Ivan Boesky and Watergate
figure H.R. Haldeman once called it home. Now their ``country
club'' prison is being fortified as a higher security lockup for
hard-time inmates.
   Lompoc Federal Prison Camp, which was free of walls, fences,
bars, guns and watch towers, will be ready to receive inmates as a
medium security prison by early August, said prison spokesman Gavin
O'Connor. It's been one of 26 minimum-security federal prisons.
   ``It's quicker and cheaper to convert the camp to a prison than
to build an entirely new facility,'' he said.
   Most of Lompoc's low-risk inmates will be transferred to other
low-security camps on the West Coast in the next few weeks,
O'Connor said.
   Prison camps such as Lompoc are referred to as country club
prisons or ``Club Fed'' because of the privileges inmates receive.
Prisoners can wander about freely, jog, play tennis or lawn bowl.
Guards are unarmed.
   Escapes have been rare at Lompoc because those caught are sent
to a traditional prison, O'Connor said.

<TEXT>
   Connie Chung said Monday that she's putting her
new television series on hold while she tries to become pregnant.
   The move, which surprised CBS executives when the 43-year-old
anchorwoman asked for it last week, marked the second time this
year that a female anchor of a network news series has opted for a
family over a show.
   However, in Chung's case, it would be temporary. CBS said it
would welcome ``Face to Face With Connie Chung'' back as a series
when she is ready to return.
   ``We want very much to have a child,'' said Chung, who is
married to ``A Current Affair'' anchorman Maury Povich, 51.
``Unfortunately, time is running out for me when it comes to
childbearing.''
   Chung noted that she will be 44 next month. After consulting
with her doctors last week, she said in a statement, she became
convinced she needs to ``take a very aggressive approach to having
a baby.''
   Because of that, she said, she has to lighten her workload, and
thus now will only do ``Face to Face'' as periodic specials instead
of the series that CBS had put on its Monday night lineup for this
fall.
   CBS will replace Chung's show with ``The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill,'' a one-hour dramatic series starring former ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey'' star Sharon Gless as recently-divorced lawyer who becomes a
public defender.
   Earlier this year, NBC's Maria Shriver left the ``Sunday Today''
show she had co-anchored since 1987. She said she wanted to spend
more time with her baby daughter and her husband, actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, in Los Angeles.
   Shriver was succeeded by former CNN anchor Mary Alice Williams,
who joined NBC last year and gave birth to a daughter in January.
   Chung, who will continue anchoring the Sunday editions of the
``CBS Evening News,'' reportedly is paid $1.3 million annually. She
was not available for comment on her decision to put her ``Face to
Face'' series on hold.
   ``This was a very important decision for Connie,'' CBS Broadcast
Group president Howard Stringer said in a statement. ``She has my
support, respect and loyalty. When Connie is ready we will happily
welcome `Face to Face' back to the schedule as a weekly series.''
   Chung, who joined CBS News in 1971 and left for NBC in 1983,
returned to CBS last year to anchor last season's low-rated
``Saturday Night With Connie Chung.''
   She scored high ratings in May with her first two ``Face to
Face'' specials.
   CBS has been third in ratings for three seasons and hoped
Chung's new series would help its bid for a comeback next fall. But
George Schweitzer, senior vice president for communications at the
Broadcast Group, insisted that her withdrawal won't hurt the
network's Monday night plans.
   ``Not at all,'' he said. CBS' replacement series has a popular,
well-known star, and is made by the same team that made ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey'' a Monday night staple on CBS, he said.
   Chung's husband, who has anchored the syndicated ``A Current
Affair'' ever since Fox Broadcasting began it in 1986, has signed
with the rival Paramount Domestic Television to co-produce and
anchor a new talk show that starts in the fall of 1991.

   A man accused of trying to break into a
visiting police chief's hotel room has been acquitted of a
misdemeanor trespass charge.
   Ricky F. Sumdum, 31, was arrested May 20 after a man was seen
tampering with the window of a room at the Westmark Hotel during
the Alaska Police Officers Association convention.
   The second-floor room was occupied by Chief Brent Moody of
Wrangell and his wife, Kathy. Moody said the man tried to pry the
window open with a piece of wood and fled when Moody tried to grab
him.
   Sumdum was arrested a few blocks away and Moody identified him.
But the chief's identification was challenged in District Court. A
jury acquitted Sumdum last week.
   Defense Attorney Phil Pallenberg said the suspect Moody
described was much younger than Sumdum and had shorter hair. Mrs.
Moody identified a different man in a photo lineup shortly after
Sumdum was arrested, Pallenberg said.

<TEXT>
   Patricia Kluge, estranged wife of
billionaire John W. Kluge, was convicted Monday of improper driving
and fined $50 for swerving to avoid hitting an animal near her
country estate.
   Mrs. Kluge, who has received recent attention for taking
personal trips with Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, did not speak
during a 15-minute hearing in Albemarle County General District
Court.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Kluge, 41, argued for the dismissal of a
reckless driving charge because the rural road on which she was
driving is narrow and does not have shoulders.
   State Trooper J.E. DeFord said Mrs. Kluge's vehicle went 35 feet
down an embankment and flipped one-and-a-half times before coming
to a stop. He said Mrs. Kluge, who was traveling alone, escaped
serious injury in the April 27 crash because she was wearing a seat
belt.
   Judge Steven Helvin reduced the charge from reckless driving to
improper driving.
   ``I don't think it's reckless driving, but I do think there is
some culpability,'' he said. Helvin said people should not swerve
uncontrollably for animals.
   Mrs. Kluge, who also had to pay $22 in court costs, was
accompanied to court by two lawyers and a security guard. She left
the courthouse afterward without comment.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Gunfire and explosions broke out
today around the government television station and Parliament,
where Moslem extremists held the prime minister and 30 other people
hostage for a fourth day.
   Later today, an Anglican minister negotiating between the
government and the rebels said a settlement was likely.
   The heaviest shooting was centered on the television station,
whose employees were taken hostage Friday. Automatic rifle and
machine-gun fire was punctuated by what sounded like artillery
booms.
   One witness said he heard four explosions that sounded like
bombs.
   ``A major firefight is going on,'' said a diplomatic source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The shooting at the station appeared to be coming from two
directions, but it was not clear whether security forces had tried
to storm the building.
   Earlier, automatic weapons fire rang out near Parliament, about
a mile from the television station, where rebels seized Prime
Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Friday. Witnesses said they heard
what sounded like heavy artillery booms.
   A ham radio operator in Trinidad said he monitored a radio
communication indicating security forces had stormed the television
station and were moving on Parliament.
   But Col. Ralph Brown of the Trinidad-Tobago Defense Force denied
the station was attacked.
   He told reporters that troops had fired on the TV station when
the rebels tried to leave the building. ``Some of his men tried to
come out and we are not letting them out.''
   An Anglican minister who was negotiating between the rebels and
the government, the Rev. Knolly Clarke, also spoke with reporters
early this afternoon.
   When asked if a peaceful solution was likely, he said, ``Yes,
today. The end is in sight.''
   One of the rebels inside Parliament, Kwasi Attiba, said by
telephone that a tentative agreement with the government had been
reached to end the siege.
   Attiba said the accord called for Robinson to resign immediately
and be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran. Attiba
gave no indication when Robinson and other other hostages would be
released, and no government official could be reached to confirm
his report.
   An agreement was also reported Sunday by a television executive,
Jones Madeira, who was held at the station. He said in a telephone
interview that under the plan, Robinson would turn over power to an
interim government, which would rule until elections in three
months.
   Robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide,
and the next elections are not scheduled until 1991.
   The rebels claim Robinson's government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed Saturday to have wired Robinson with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Attiba said the gunfire at Parliament came from police ``who
have been attempting to thwart'' negotiations.
   Attiba said the rebels were holding eight government ministers
along with the prime minister.
   Energy Minister Herbert Atwell said Sunday the two sides were
far from a settlement. But Attiba said: ``We are very hopeful for
an amicable solution.''
   Security forces patrolled the capital with orders to shoot
looters on sight.
   Abu Bakr, leader of a black Moslem commune, stormed Parliament
on Friday and captured Robinson and most of his Cabinet. Bakr is
believed backed by Libya but has little general support.
   Simultaneously, the rebels seized the government television
station and its employees.
   Unconfirmed reports said more than 20 people had been killed in
the fighting. A medical officer at the state hospital said today he
could confirm only five deaths, including that of a police officer.
   Fires burned in the capital of Port-of-Spain on Sunday. There
was scattered gunfire and widespread looting. Convoys of cars and
pickup trucks were loading up with everything from looted powdered
milk to refrigerators, electric stoves and television sets.
   The government sent police and military patrols to re-establish
order and continued a nationwide curfew that was imposed Saturday.
   Atwell, representing the government, appeared on national
television late Sunday with an official statement saying: ``I am in
no position to offer any hope that the situation will be resolved
speedily and-or amicably.''
   He confirmed reports that Robinson and Justice Minister Selwyn
Richardson had each been shot in the leg.
   State-run radio 610 said Nolli Clarke, an Anglican priest, was
the official mediator with help from Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah
and Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Patin.
   The Red Cross sent mobile units to take blood donations from
people too frightened to leave their homes.
   Radio 610 estimated damage downtown at $50 million as thousands
of people looted stores, shopping centers, warehouses and
industrial plants.
   A spokeswoman for President Bush said Sunday that American
citizens and tourists on Trinidad and Tobago did not appear to be
in danger.
   ``Obviously we support the government and are coordinating
closely with them until the situation is resolved,'' a State
Department official said in Washington. The official did not want
to be identified.
   Bakr is a former policeman in his mid-40s who converted to Islam
in 1980 while living in Canada.
   He founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in
Arabic, in 1984 and set up a commune on land he said had been
donated to Moslems by the late prime minister, Eric Williams.
   Bakr built a mosque, a school and a kitchen to feed the
homeless. Some 250 to 300 Moslems live there.
   Bakr has visited Libya several times and is believed to have
received assistance from that country.
   He has said the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and the
destruction'' of Trinidad and Tobago, which has high unemployment
and skyrocketing food prices.

<HEAD>Bush Thanks Governors For Bipartisan Effort on Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush thanked the nation's
governors for a bipartisan ``constructive relationship'' on
education Monday, even as Democrats stepped up their protest
against the administration's latest tax proposal.
   Bush addressed the governors at their National Governors'
Association annual summer conference, speaking by remote telephone
hookup from the White House.
   He pledged continued support for the education reform goals he
and the governors agreed on last year, and endorsed their revised
plans for a national oversight panel that will grade the states and
federal government on progress in meeting the goals. Democrats had
insisted on the changes to deny Republicans control of the panel.
   ``I think it is essential there be some definitive way of
measuring progress toward these education goals during the '90s,
and this decision ... makes good sense,'' Bush said. ``I want to
thank everyone there for the constructive relationship that we've
developed.''
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat and incoming chairman
of the governors, asked Bush to obtain full federal funding for
Head Start and early childhood development programs that are part
of the education goals. Bush said, ``We'll see what we can do.''
   Democrats, meanwhile, were circulating a letter for signature by
the governors that protests in strong terms the administration's
proposal in budget negotiations to raise federal revenues by
limiting the deduction for state income taxes _ a proposal
governors say encroaches on state tax bases.
   ``To eliminate this deduction would result in a double tax on
our citizens,'' said the letter.
   It was being pushed by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whom
Bush defeated in the 1988 presidential election, and Maryland Gov.
William Donald Schaefer.
   ``The notion of putting the burden on the states again for
Washington's inability to deal with its fiscal problems is just
outrageous,'' Dukakis said in an interview.
   Governors in both parties have voiced opposition to the federal
proposal, arguing that limiting the deduction for state taxes to
$10,000 would make it more difficult for states to raise their own
taxes and put pressure on them to roll back income taxes. They said
it comes after states have spent a decade absorbing cuts in federal
aid and after most states have had to raise their own taxes.
   Dukakis said Bush, who used his ``read my lips, no new taxes''
slogan so effectively in the 1988 campaign, has made the deficit
worse by delaying action and now, in breaking his pledge, is
hammering the states.
   ``If Mr. Bush, no matter how devastating it might have been to
his poll ratings, had moved early as everybody knew had to be done
... I don't think we'd be in the kind of mess we're in now,''
Dukakis said.
   The letter pushed by Dukakis and Schaefer went beyond a milder
mention that Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, outgoing chairman of
the governors' organization, and Gardner made in a letter to Bush
before the meeting.
   Dukakis' letter said the administration's plan amounts to a
suggestion ``that our citizens should pay a federal penalty tax for
living in a state that has taken responsibility'' for paying for
its own services.
   The deduction issue affects states unevenly, falling heaviest on
Northeastern states with high income taxes and not affecting those
that have no income tax.
   The governors made only brief mention of their opposition when
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, former governor of New
Hampshire, appeared before the governors Sunday. Sununu said he
couldn't talk about items that were a part of budget negotiations
with Congress.
   But Dukakis noted that the proposal wouldn't limit the deduction
for local property taxes, and that ``it just so happens New
Hampshire has the highest property taxes in the country.'' New
Hampshire has no income tax.

   A proposal by Democratic governors for a
national commission to investigate the savings and loan crisis was
rejected today by the White House.
   ``We do feel it is unnecessary to create another bureacratic
body,'' White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said in
Washington.
   ``We think the best thing to do is to work quickly on the
current caseload with the funds and the processes we now have in
place which are working,'' Hart said. ... ``We feel it's not time
to point fingers but it's time to get the money that's owed to the
depositors back in their hands.''
   The commission idea was pushed by Democrats at the National
Governors' Association annual summer conference.
   They also forced Republicans to accept changes in a proposed
national education oversight panel made up of governors, members of
Congress and White House appointees.
   ```Bipartisan' is a very convenient word when you have a
president of your party because what you're asking is to have
everyone walk hand-in-hand with the president,'' said Ohio Gov.
Richard Celeste, head of the Democratic governors, who is
considered to have presidential ambitions.
   However, he added, ``that isn't real bipartisan policy-making.''
   Separately, President Bush addressed the meeting by telephone
and said he wanted to continue a partnership with the governors to
improve America's schools. ``I recognize there is diversity and
I've made it a point not to get involved in any state, pointing out
how a governor might attempt to do the job better,'' Bush said.
   Sunday's opening session got off to a rocky start when Democrats
expressed their frustration over an element of the education
reforms they agreed on with President Bush last fall and winter.
   Fearing that a national panel to grade states on their progress
in meeting education goals could become a partisan sword in the
hands of the GOP-controlled White House, Democratic governors
failed to show up for a task force meeting on education with their
GOP colleagues.
   After a series of closed-door meetings, the governors agreed to
a formula making any decisions impossible without a three-quarters
majority _ giving Democrats on the panel an effective veto power.
   They also agreed that the panel would give the federal
government _ and the Bush White House _ a score on how it lives up
to goals for improving federal education research and supporting
early childhood development.
   Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina fumed that
Democrats were trying to polarize the governors and disrupt a
year's consensus on education reforms. Thirty-six governor's seats
are at stake in this fall's elections.
   ``If partisanship is more important than education, then I'll
let them defend that,'' Campbell said.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, a former chairman of the
governors as New Hampshire's chief executive, appeared before his
former colleagues to defend the administration's latest proposal to
raise revenue by limiting the deductibility of state and local
taxes. Governors in both parties oppose the idea as an encroachment
on state tax authority.
   Celeste reminded Sununu that when he headed the governors'
association ``one of the concerns you raised at that time was how
to protect the revenue base of state and local government.''
   But Sununu responded that the original Bush budget was
``consistent with the concerns you raised.'' He warned that without
a deficit-reduction agreement domestic programs face 40 percent
cuts under the automatic budget-balancing law.
   The proposal on S&amp;Ls amounts to a statement of concern and a
request to Congress and the president. It passed on a voice vote of
the NGA executive committee and is subject to a vote of all the
governors on Tuesday, the meeting's last day.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat, predicted Congress
and President Bush would ignore it. But he said the statement
amounted to ``a vote of no-confidence in federal action'' on S&amp;Ls
so far.
   Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, who proposed the
commission idea, said its job would be to determine what went
wrong. He insisted he was ``not interested in bashing the
administration.''
   ``The only people who are going to pay are the taxpayers,''
Wilder said. ``The taxpayers are entitled to know.''
   Republican governors unsuccessfully tried to delete mention of
the commission. Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico called it ``a
feel-good'' vote, and Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri said it would
only delay a solution.
   ``I think the time for studying is over,'' Ashcroft said.

<HEAD>Two Killed, 80 Injured When Bridge Railings Give Way</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Guard rails on a bridge crammed with
merchants and shoppers gave way under the weight of the crowd, and
two people were killed and 80 injured as they fell into the river
below, state media said Monday.
   The state news agency Rompres said 10 of the injured were in
critical condition after Sunday's accident. It said the accident
apparently was caused by overcrowding due to ``careless merchants''
selling their wares on the bridge, which leads to the flea market
in the Transylvanian city of Tirgu Mures.
   The crowd reportedly pressed against a railing, causing it to
collapse. In the melee that ensued, the other railing also gave
way, and dozens of people fell into the river Mures 18 feet below.
   Rompress said two women died. The report said 26 of the injured
required hospitalization. Most suffered broken bones and chest
injuries.
   Some newspapers in recent weeks had criticized private traders
in the city, who reportedly acquire goods from state-run shops
illegally and resell them at much higher prices on the black market.
   Romania for years has been plagued by widespread consumer and
food shortages.
   Tirgu Mures is in central Romania. It was the site of violent
clashes between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians that left at
least six dead and hundreds injured in mid-March.

   A series of Irish Republican Army bombings has
highlighted the group's ability to get around security in England,
where fear of terrorism is balanced against a determination to live
normally.
   Police believe the bomb that killed Conservative Party lawmaker
Ian Gow Monday was planted by the IRA, which has recently struck
against the British army, the Stock Exchange and a London club
favored by Conservatives.
   No group, however, immediately claimed responsibility for the
slaying of Gow outside his home in Southeastern Hankham.
   Metal detectors at the House of Commons and a barrier guarding
the prime minister's home testify to the threat, but most of London
remains a relaxed and open city.
   Politicians and experts on terrorism argue that intensive
security and fear would indicate a victory for the IRA, which has
waged a terrorist campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland
for two decades.
   Gow, killed by a bomb stuck beneath his car, had been warned he
was on an IRA hit list. But his telephone number was listed and
neighbors said his gate was often open.
   ``Mr. Gow was determined not to live in a castle and be
protected,'' said Jonathan Graves, parish priest in Gow's village.
``He lived an open life.''
   Peter Bottomley, another Conservative lawmaker, expressed the
feeling of many politicians on increased security:
   ``We need to take obvious and sensible precautions. ... But the
idea that each of us can have four bodyguards around us would mean
that the IRA had won.''
   The recent attacks, however, have prompted appeals for a return
of the tight security following the death of six people in an IRA
bombing at Harrod's department store in 1983. For a time, bags and
parcels were searched at shop entrances.
   Scotland Yard recently distributed 13,000 posters advertising a
toll-free hotline for reporting suspicious activities. A
spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said a surge in notifications of
suspicious parcels indicated heightened public concern.
   Late last year, a gate and a retractable concrete barrier were
installed at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's official residence,
No. 10 Downing Street.
   But terrorism expert Ian Geldard said increasing security for
all politicians _ who now rely on mundane precautions such as
checking beneath cars _ would not necessarily be the best solution.
   ``You can never have total security,'' Geldard said. ``The
terrorists always have the advantage because they can choose the
time and the place.''
   Geldard, editor of Terror Update, a privately circulated
newsletter, said the IRA clearly has targeted specific
establishments and individuals.
   ``It would not be particularly sensible to increase security for
everyone. The amount of disruption would be a victory for the
IRA,'' he said.
   An unidentified IRA leader discussed the group's strategy in an
interview published in the June 28 edition of Republican News, the
weekly newspaper of the IRA and its Sinn Fein political wing.
   The IRA intends to ``surprise the enemy, give them no rest,
continually pressurize them and of course to hit them where it
hurts, preferably at the central nervous system,'' the leader said.
   He gave as an example the attack on the Carlton Club, a facility
frequented primarily by members of the Conservative Party.
   There was no warning before that bombing or before Gow was
killed. But eight warnings preceded the explosion in the visitor's
gallery at the Stock Exchange on July 20.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Monday urged lawmakers to take warnings
seriously.
   ``Many members of Parliament, indeed all of them, will have been
given advice to have special regard for safety,'' she said. ``I
make one plea, that they take that advice very seriously indeed,
for themselves and their families and their staffs.''
   Government security advisers refuse to detail arrangements, but
it is widely believed lawmakers are advised to vary their daily
routine. Mrs. Thatcher Monday told lawmakers to check under their
cars and examine all parcels arriving by mail.

   The one-sentence item provided no other details on his trip.
   Gorbachev usually takes about a month's vacation in August.

citizens congratulating him on his re-election as general secretary
at the 28th Communist Party congress.
   Gorbachev said he was moved by their good wishes, the news
agency reported.
   ``I shall apply every effort, using the rights and possibilities
that go with my state and party posts, to make sure current
difficulties will be overcome and decisive headway made along the
path of far-reaching political and economic reform and renewal in
every aspect of society's life,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.

   Government troops today broke into a
refugee camp in Monrovia and massacred at least 600 people, most of
them women and children, witnesses said.
   The government denied responsibility.
   People who said they escaped the attack said about 30 soldiers
blasted the church door down with machines guns. They then opened
fire on an estimated 2,000 people from the Gio and Mano tribes who
had taken refuge there. The Gio and Mano tribes speak a different
language than the government troops.
   One witness who visited the Lutheran Church compound in the
Sinkor district of the capital said he saw women with their heads
smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets, babies still tied to
their backs.
   Bodies of other people were hanging from the window frames of
the church building, apparently killed while trying to escape, he
said.
   ``I saw dead bodies all around,'' the source said. ``This is
genocide.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier today in Washington, White House deputy press secretary
Stephen Hart said U.S. Embassy officials confirmed that Liberian
troops slaughtered at least 200 people at the church compound.
There was no independent confirmation of the 600 dead figure.
   A spokesman for President Samuel Doe said rebels were
responsible for the killings. In a radio telephone call to the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London, the spokesman said rebels
wearing government uniforms killed the civilians.
   Refugees at a Methodist church across the street fled when they
heard the killing.
   Thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war between rebel forces
and the crumbling government of President Samuel Doe are crowded
into refugee camps in the area. Their numbers have swelled recently
as rebel troops have stormed into Monrovia.
   The witnesses said soldiers broke into the church compound at
about 2 a.m. when the refugees were asleep. There was no telephone
in the compound, so the victims had no way of calling for help.
   Most refugees were members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which
form the main support for the rebels. Most of Doe's troops are from
his Krahn tribe and the Mandingo tribe.
   Refugees sought protection at the church at the end of May after
government soldiers attacked them at U.N. headquarters in Monrovia.
The soldiers killed an unarmed security guard and abducted about 30
civilian men. Many of their bodies were later discovered on the
outskirts of the capital.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar withdrew all U.N.
staff from Liberia in protest, halting an emergency program to aid
war refugees. The U.N. chief said in New York that he reacted
``with horror and dismay'' to today's massacre.
   The White House condemned the massacre as a ``senseless act of
terror.'' But it said the United States was not about to send in
any troops. ``At this point we don't believe that would be a
prudent course of action,'' Hart told reporters.
   As street battles raged in downtown Monrovia, rebel leader
Prince Johnson seemed more preoccupied with his power struggle with
a rival leader than with victory over President Doe.
   Johnson told two Western photographers on Sunday that the rival
rebel leader, Charles Taylor, is ``a criminal and a rogue.''
   ``He contacted Libya to bring communism here, and Moammar
Gadhafi gave him $8 million to stage the Liberian revolution,''
Johnson alleged as he met the photographers in a small cafe in a
Monrovian suburb.
   Taylor has consistently denied reports he received aid from
Gadhafi and claims to be a die-hard capitalist.
   In a separate meeting with foreign reporters Sunday, Johnson
said he was leading the main rebel attack on Monrovia and claimed
to have 7,000 men under his command, including 4,000 deserters from
Doe's army.
   ``I will get Doe. He is not going to get away,'' said the
38-year-old Johnson, whose forces had advanced to within a mile of
Doe's seaside mansion.
   Johnson said he would install a civilian government after Doe is
overthrown.
   Taylor's forces remained in Paynesville, about six miles east of
downtown, where their advance has been blocked for several weeks by
stiff resistance from government troops. Taylor claims to have at
least 5,000 fighters.
   As Johnson spoke to reporters from the back of a heavily armed
pickup truck, his forces captured street fter street in fierce
fighting.
   The streets were filled with spent cartridges and most of the
buildings in the area were riddled with bullet holes after three
days of battles.
   Bodies of dozens of civilians shot by retreating government
troops late Saturday lay in the streets of the downtown business
district.
   Among the public buildings captured by the rebels were the
defense ministry, the central post office and the national bank.
   Doe remained barricaded in his hilltop executive mansion,
surrounded by an elite guard of troops.
   Rebels reportedly killed Doe's assistant minister of defense,
Steven Blayee, as he was trying to escape from the capital Sunday
morning.
   Johnson, who split with Taylor in February, said the two had
trained in Libya with 167 men who later formed the backbone of the
rebellion. He said Taylor had agreed to adhere to Libyan socialist
principles, while he had not.
   The rebels invaded in December from Ivory Coast, accusing Doe's
government of corruption and human rights abuses.
   Doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted the elitist
descendants of freed American slaves who founded the nation in
1847. Liberia has 2 million people.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.3 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.50 percent, up from 7.49 percent
last week. Another $9.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.37 percent, down from 7.40 percent last
week.
   The three-month bill rate was the highest since they sold for
7.62 percent on July 16. The six-month bill rate was the lowest
since it averaged 7.30 percent last Dec. 4.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.75 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,810.40 and 7.76 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,627.40.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.85
percent last week, down from 7.87 percent the previous week.

   Bailey, 72, will stay in Philadelphia for about a week to
continue physical therapy, the hospital said. Back in her Arizona
home, she will continue exercising and in six weeks should be able

   The bone and cartilage in the knee had degenerated, doctors

   There won't be a single City Council
candidate on the November ballot in this central Arkansas town.
   The incumbents were not apathetic, just forgetful.
   ``We flat goofed up,'' Alderman John Sutton said Sunday,
explaining how he and the rest of the council missed Friday's
deadline to file for re-election.
   Mayor Floyd ``Sonny'' Johnson filed in the nick of time, after
being reminded of a change in the filing date.
   Johnson drew one challenger, but no one filed petitions to run
for the council, which helps govern this town of about 1,200
southeast of Little Rock.
   The six council members, all of whom want their seats back, have
until September to file as write-in candidates. But as write-ins,
their names would not be printed on the November ballot.
   The filing deadline was changed last year from September to July.

<HEAD>Cheney Cuts Stars From Personal Staff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered Monday
that the number of generals and admirals assigned to his staff be
cut in half.
   Cheney directed that 13 of the 27 spots on his personal staff
that are saved for Army, Air Force, Marine generals and Navy
admirals be eliminated, filled with civilians, or given to lower
ranking military officers, a Pentagon statement said.
   The effect isn't necessarily immediate, since the changes will
be made when the officers in the present positions finish their
tours of duty or move on to their next assignments, the statement
said.
   The change is in line with the Defense Department's moves to
pare the nation's armed forces in response to ``world changes and
tighter budgets,'' the statement said.
   The affected job positions include the adviser for NATO Affairs,
the deputy assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs,
the assistant inspector general, and the assistant to the assistant
to the Secretary of Defense for atomic energy.
   It follows an order Cheney made last month to eliminate 78 of
the Pentagon's 1,073 flag officer positions over the next four
years. Monday's action doesn't add to that number, it only
designates that 13 of those general officer slots no longer be on
Cheney's personal staff, the statement said.
   The managers of the staff organizations affected by Cheney's
decision can decide what will be done with each slot, the statement
said.
   ``With fewer generals and admirals, those who remain must be
placed in positions of command and crucial military
responsibility,'' the statement quoted Cheney as saying. ``We
cannot afford to assign our most seasoned and experienced military
officers to Pentagon staff jobs that could be handled by civilians
or less senior military officers.''
   Pentagon spokesman Bill Turner said he knew of no study that had
been undertaken to determine the cost savings behind such a move.
   Turner predicted, however, that the long-term savings could be
substantial due to reduced salaries and the cost of the support
facilities generally offered high-ranking military men and women.
   The lowest-ranking general, a one-star, now earns a little over
$69,000 a year, not including allowances for such things as housing
and food. A four-star receives a maximum of $83,000 a year in base
pay, Turner said.

   Rock 'n' roll star Chuck Berry
surrendered to police Monday to face charges of marijuana
possession and child abuse, authorities said.
   The St. Charles County Sheriff's office said Berry, who had been
on tour in Europe, surrendered Monday morning and was taken to
jail, where he was booked. He later appeared before Associate
Circuit Judge Lucy Rauch, who set bond at $20,000.
   The 63-year-old musician, known for such rock 'n' roll standards
as ``Johnny B. Goode,'' and ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' posted a
property bond and was released, officials said.
   Berry was charged July 19 after local drug agents raided his
rural estate near Wentzville, about 40 miles west of St. Louis.
   A statement released by William Hannah, St. Charles County
prosecutor, said four charges were filed against Berry.
   One charge was for possession of over 35 grams of marijuana.
Three child abuse charges are based on allegations Berry made nude
films of youths under the age of 17 for sexual gratification.
   Authorities said the search of his estate turned up several
plastic bags of marijuana, some hashish, two .22-caliber rifles and
a shotgun, plus $122,000 and various pornographic videotapes,
slides and books.
   Berry has denied using drugs.
   Arraignment was scheduled for Aug. 30.

<TEXT>
   New Musicals, an ambitious laboratory for the
development of new American musical theater, has folded after only
one production, it was announced Monday.
   The production company was terminated July 25, one month after
its first show, ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' closed out a
disappointing run at the State University of New York at Purchase.
   ``I overestimated the box-office income and undercapitalized the
operation,'' said Martin J. Bell, producing director of New
Musicals. ``The size of our audience could only support workshops
or small musicals, which was contrary to our mission.''
   ``Spider Woman'' was a lavish musical version of the Manuel Puig
novel. It had a book by Terrence McNally, a score by John Kander
and Fred Ebb and was directed by Harold Prince. The musical, which
starred John Rubinstein and Kevin Gray, played an eight-week
engagement in Purchase, from May 1 through June 24.
   New Musicals had a $10 million budget for its first year which
was to have included three more musicals. Investors, including
Capital Cities-ABC, Inc., Columbia Artists Management, Inc., and
Jujamcyn Theaters, had put up a total of about $2.5 million to get
the project going.
   Other moneys were expected from the box-office receipts of
``Spider Woman,'' which drew less than 40 percent capacity at a
1,375-seat theater in the university's performing arts complex.
   Bell said the box-office receipts were hurt by the mostly
negative reviews, especially in The New York Times. The producer
had asked that critics not review the show because it was a work in
progress and that a review ``defeats what we're trying to do
here.'' Besides the Times, the musical was reviewed by the Daily
News, the New York Post, The Associated Press and several other
publications.
   ``My heart is broken, but working on `Kiss of the Spider Woman'
with Hal Prince, John Kander, Fred Ebb, Terrence McNally and the
rest of the gang was worth it all,'' Bell said. ``There were times
sitting in that theater during the process when I knew this was the
only place on Earth I wanted to be.''

<HEAD>More Than 100 Polish Parliament Members Urge Jaruzelski to Quit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 members of Parliament have
signed a petition urging President Wojciech Jaruzelski to resign,
newspapers reported Monday.
   The signatures were gathered late Friday by members of the
Center Alliance, a 2-month-old political organization that backs
the election of Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa to replace
Jaruzelski this fall, said the government-owned daily
Rzeczpospolita.
   Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader, has already
indicated he will resign before his term officially expires in July
1995.
   Jaruzelski told the Sejm, the 460-member lower house of
parliament, on Saturday that he endorses plans to hold a debate in
September on the proper timing of new presidential and
parliamentary elections.
   The Center Alliance petition asks Jaruzelski to step down in
recognition that conditions have changed since his election in July
1989.
   ``Appreciating your contributions, Mr. President, since taking
office, we appeal to you now to show understanding for the historic
challenges of the new era and to resign from office,'' the petition
said.
   Jaruzelski was elected president by Parliament with the help of
some members of Solidarity a year ago after Poland's Communist
Party became the first in the East bloc to give up its monopoly on
power and hold partially free elections.
   At the time, it was thought Jaruzelski's holding the presidency
would insure smooth relations with the Soviet Union and Poland's
then-hard-line Communist neighbors, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Since then, orthodox Communist leaders have been ousted in a
democratic upheavals that led to multiparty elections throughout
Eastern Europe.
   Many Poles consider Jaruzelski's remaining as president to be
out of step with the changes elsewhere in the region. Jaruzelski
led the December 1981 martial law crackdown that suppressed the
Solidarity labor movement, but later initiated negotiations on
power-sharing that resulted in the union becoming legal again last
year.
   Walesa has not declared his intention to run for president, but
his supporters are gathering allies in the Sejm and the 100-member
Senate for a possible vote to elect him to the post in coming
months.
   Opposing Walesa are members of a new pro-government party, the
Citizens Movement for Democratic Action, which favors a
constitutional amendment that would require a direct popular vote
for president. They believe Walesa could be defeated in such a
ballot.
   Some members of Democratic Action are promoting Solidarity Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki as a more viable presidential candidate
than Walesa.
   Both Democratic Action and Center Alliance have grown out of the
Solidarity movement, now deeply split into pro-Walesa and
pro-Mazowiecki wings.

   Marilyn Quayle, recuperating from a

   Mrs. Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, is recovering

   She said Mrs. Quayle had received boxes of messages and cards.
   ``She is most appreciative of everyone's thoughtfulness and
their prayers,'' Mrs. Balzano said.
   Mrs. Quayle returned home last Wednesday, four days after
undergoing a hysterectomy. The vice president's press office said
the operation was performed because Pap smears indicated she had
``severe dysplasia,'' a cell abnormality that experts said can be a
precursor to cervical cancer.

   A Spanish diplomat said Monday there is no
solution in sight to a conflict with Cuban authorities over 18
asylum-seekers at the Spanish Embassy in Havana, the Notimex news
agency reported.
   The Mexican government agency quoted Fidel Sandagorta,
first-secretary at the embassy, as saying there was no indication
anything could lead to a quick end to the impasse, which has
strained relations between Spain and its former colony, Cuba.
   The refugees at the Spanish Embassy are the last remaining of
dozens who sought asylum in Swiss, Czechoslovak, Spanish and
Italian missions starting July 9.
   On Saturday, four Cubans left the Italian ambassador's residence
in Havana after President Fidel Castro promised not to prosecute
refugees who fled to diplomatic compounds.
   The diplomat said Spain maintains its position that the refugees
cannot be forced to abandon the embassy unless there are
satisfactory conditions for their departure.
   But Cuba will not let anyone leave the country who has entered a
diplomatic mission by force.
   Havana accused the United States of masterminding the waive of
refugees as part of an alleged plot to destabilize Cuba, charges
the United States denied.
   Spain suspended a $2.5 million aid program after Cuba took a
hard-line on Cubans who entered the Spanish Embassy. Castro accused
Spain of collaborating with the United States and renounced the aid.

<HEAD>State Can Contact Patients Of Dentist With AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Patients of a Florida dentist who may
have given a woman AIDS could be tracked down and asked to take
AIDS tests, but they couldn't be told why, officials said Monday.
   Florida law protects the identity of anyone who has AIDS, even
from those who may have been infected by the person.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control last week described a case
involving a 21-year-old college student who may have gotten AIDS
from her dentist during a tooth extraction. The dentist was
diagnosed with AIDS three months earlier and wore gloves and a mask.
   State health officials have made no public comment about
published reports that the woman was from somewhere in Florida.
   Two sources, however, confirmed Monday on condition they not be
identified, that it was a Florida dentist.
   The CDC said the case was the first in the nation involving a
health professional possibly transmitting AIDS, although
researchers could not positively say how the woman got infected.
But the CDC did rule out more conventional ways of getting the
disease such as sexual encounters or intravenous drug use.
   The name of any Florida resident who has acquired immune
deficiency syndrome or who tests positive for the AIDS virus is
confidential under Florida law, said spokesman Steve Konicki of the
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   While officials wouldn't confirm publicly that the CDC case
originated in Florida, they were willing to say that if it did, the
state has the ability to track down the dentist's patients to urge
them to be tested for AIDS.
   ``If this was a Florida case, HRS would be able to contact
patients of the doctor,'' said Brian Ballard, Gov. Bob Martinez's
chief of staff. ``I can assure you that HRS understands their
mission is public safety.''
   The patients would not be told, however, that their connection
to the dentist was the reason they were asked to take an AIDS test,
Konicki said.
   That same confidentiality protection applies to anyone with AIDS
to encourage them to disclose names of people to whom they may have
transmitted the disease.
   ``The intent of the law, the confidentiality part of the law, is
that it only goes to the identity of somebody who's infected,''
said state Rep. Lois Frankel, chairwoman of the task force that
produced a sweeping 1988 Florida AIDS law.
   ``Confidentiality is an important part of contact tracing,'' she
said. ``You can't force someone to give you the name of a partner.''
   Questions were raised about the laws that protect patient
records of doctors and dentists, which would be one of the only
ways to obtain names of those at risk. While Ballard said the state
should have access to the overriding issue of public health, others
aren't so sure.
   ``It's confidential. The only thing (the state) could do is go
to court and get a court order. They'd have to rule that the case
overrides the patient-doctor relationship,'' said state Rep. Elaine
Gordon, chairwoman of the House Health Care Committee.
   Announcement of the case and the national attention it triggered
drew complaints from the American Dental Association, which worried
that it would make the public fear a dentist's office as a place of
``danger and infection.''
   Florida health officials questioned whether the CDC knew enough
to go public with such a potentially frightening report.
   Dr. Harold Jaffe, deputy director for science at the CDC's
HIV-AIDS program, responded that it was in the public's interest to
publicize the case.

<HEAD>Bumper U.S. Marijuana Crop Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mild, rainy summer has been ideal for marijuana
cultivation in the Midwest, police say as they work to weed out an
expected bumper crop.
   It isn't just the weather that's boosting production. Stepped-up
federal efforts to stop drugs from being smuggled into the country
have driven up the price of marijuana, encouraging the growers to
increase their efforts, according to federal authorities and law
enforcement officials in several states.
   ``We've had all this rain, good hot, humid weather which
marijuana thrives in, and plenty of people interested in making a
little money,'' said Sgt. Jim Hinkle of the Illinois State Police.
   Hinkle coordinates Operation Cash Crop, an eradication program
the state runs jointly with the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas
and Wisconsin are expected to have massive tracts of cultivated and
wild marijuana by fall, officials said. California, though wracked
by drought, also is likely to produce a bumper crop of marijuana,
officials said.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says U.S.-grown
marijuana is netting drug dealers hundreds of millions of dollars
annually. Cultivated, high quality marijuana _ like the potent
sinsemilla variety _ sells for about $2,500 a pound, Hinkle said.
One plant can provide a pound of the drug, he said.
   The street price of average-grade marijuana is about $160 to
$240 per ounce this year across the country, up from $120 to $180
an ounce a year ago, according to the DEA.
   Authorities hope to get the jump on pot growers before the
harvest season, which lasts for three months beginning in September.
   In Northern California over the weekend, about 200 federal and
state agents descended on prime public land to hunt for pot in what
was called the largest marijuana raid in the state.
   An even bigger problem, officials say, is finding ``ditch
weed.'' The wild plant has little potency but is used to cheat
buyers by mixing with higher-quality strains.
   Ditch weed grows in abundance in many states _ much to the
consternation of police _ because it is an offspring of seeds
planted when marijuana was cultivated to make hemp rope in World
War II, drug officials say.
   ``It is, after all, a weed, and it grows _ and grows and
grows,'' Hinkle said.
   Nebraska in 1989 eradicated more than 73 million ditch weed
plants and 6,300 cultivated marijuana plants. That's nearly twice
the number of ditch weed plants plucked in Indiana, which ranks
second to Nebraska in wild weed destruction, according to DEA
statistics.
   Jeff Hanson, spokesman for the Nebraska State Patrol, said the
state has been a magnet for people looking for free marijuana.
   ``I think word kind of spread around that we have marijuana
here,'' Hanson said in a telephone interview. ``We get a lot of
out-of-state plates on these rural dirt roads, and you don't have
to be super-intelligent to figure out these people aren't out there
just to enjoy the scenery.''
   Police everywhere say pot farmers are hard to catch because the
land where marijuana thrives often is isolated.
   Many states rely on informants and aerial surveillance to nab
suspects and spot marijuana plots. Illinois offers $1,000 to
residents who call in with information leading to a substantive
arrest.
   Critics say the use of informants smacks of spying on the
neighbors, but law enforcement officials' contend the public's help
in eradicating illegal drugs is vital.
   ``It's difficult to catch these guys and to prove a case,
especially a cultivation case,'' Hanson said. ``We really do need
the public's help.''

   Two journalists alleged Monday that some radio
reporters working free-lance for foreign stations accepted money or
favors from the Foreign Ministry to do pro-Israel stories packaged
as independent news items.
   The two, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
free-lancers worked out of a Jerusalem recording studio that has
close ties with the ministry.
   The ministry denied the allegations in a statement released
Monday, but said it suspended all ties with the studio lest ``some
aspects of the current arrangements ... be misconstrued as
involving a conflict of interest.''
   The New York Times reported Monday that ministry officials
secretly channeled money to the studio to pay the reporters'
salaries. It also said Israeli diplomats abroad helped the
free-lance reporters recruit radio clients in major locations.
   One Jerusalem-based radio reporter told The Associated Press the
ministry paid the studio fee of $75 per hour for some free-lance
reporters who otherwise would have to cover the expense themselves.
   In return, ``sometimes they (ministry officials) ask the
reporters to publish certain information,'' the reporter said.
   Another broadcast journalist said some colleagues working for
foreign stations accepted money from the ministry in exchange for
stories favorable to Israel packaged as independent news reports.
   The ministry statement Monday declared, ``There are no
journalists on the Foreign Ministry payroll.''
   The ministry said it has worked with the studio for years,
commissioning programs on current events and other subjects that
are distributed by Israeli embassies abroad.
   It said the programs were ``distributed by us and in our name.''
   The ministry claimed that it decided to suspend ties with the
studio on July 18 _ 10 days before it was first asked by The New
York Times about the relationship.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ministry was concerned
that some journalists who worked for the studio were also
``independent journalists,'' meaning they free-lanced for clients
abroad.
   But Avi Yaffe, owner of the studio, said the suspension was a
result of the media inquiries.
   ``About 2{ weeks ago, they (ministry officials) said there are
all kinds of journalists that are asking questions. We think we
have a problem here,'' Yaffe told the AP in an interview at his
studioon Herzl Boulevard in Jerusalem.
   ``They (ministry officials) said they don't want problems, they
don't want to be linked to something like this.''
   Yaffe said nearly half his business came from the Foreign
Ministry, but denied allegations of a covert link.
   He said free-lance reporters use his studio to produce programs
for foreign radio stations, including two major U.S. networks and
outlets in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia.
   Yaffe said he had more than 10 free-lance reporters working in
the studio. ``Most of the reporters are also working for other
(media) organizations, and they are moonlighting here,'' he said.
   He refused to identify the reporters.
   Yaffe said that to simplify accounting procedures, foreign radio
stations paid the studio in full for each broadcast prepared by a
reporter. The station kept part of it for use of the facilities,
and passed the rest on to the reporter, he said.
   The ministry and Yaffe acknowledged that the ministry held
briefings for reporters using the studio.
   ``Sometimes, somebody from there (the Foreign Ministry) says if
you want, we have such and such a guy who will talk to you about
something,'' Yaffe said. He said it was left up to the reporters
whether to attend.
   Connie Mus, chief of the Foreign Press Association and a
reporter for the Christian Broadcast Network, said he was concerned
over the reports. ``This undermines the position of every
journalist working in this country,'' he said.
   ``Professional journalists should be independent. If they're
paid by the Foreign Ministry, it discredits the entire press
corps.''

   Prosecutors and Mayor Marion Barry's attorneys
finished presenting evidence Monday in the mayor's drug and perjury
trial, and Barry pleaded with the city's black residents to avoid
reacting violently if he is convicted.
   ``We have grown as a people in the last 20 years, and we are not
going to destroy what we have brought back,'' Barry said after the
court session ended. ``Those who talk about that don't represent
me.''
   Barry scoffed at conjecture that rioting could occur like that
which happened in the nation's capital when the Rev. Martin Luther
King was assassinated in 1968.
   ``Frankly, I really don't see (rioting) happening no matter what
happens,'' Barry said. ``I want to say I have heard no serious
consideration of anything like that.''
   The evidentiary phase of the trial came to an unexpected early
ending when Barry's lawyers abandoned an effort to call two
witnesses they had hoped could weaken the government's case on one
of the 10 cocaine-possession charges the mayor faces.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson then set
closing arguments for Wednesday morning, providing an extra day to
prepare them as Barry's lawyers had requested.
   On Friday, prosecutors introduced a document showing city worker
Clifton Roberson was absent from his job at the time Roberson said
he had accepted a job application from admitted crack cocaine
dealer Lydia Pearson.
   Pearson had testified that she delivered the application, along
with crack cocaine, to the mayor about 10 a.m. Sept. 7, 1988.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said Roberson was absent from
his job later in the day but was there in the morning to get the
application.
   Mundy said he had wanted to recall Roberson but decided against
it Monday because the worker couldn't be ``dead certain'' about
what happened on Sept. 7.
   At issue is whether Roberson was absent from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30
p.m., as the form originally indicated, or whether he was away from
the office from 8:30 a.m. until 10:30 p.m. The latter time was
listed in the margin above the original 4:30 p.m. entry, which had
been scratched out.
   Mundy said Roberson could testify to being away from work late
in the day, but couldn't be as certain about who had made the
handwritten change.
   ``He doesn't think it is his handwriting, but he can't say for
sure,'' Mundy said. ``He just can't recall that precisely.''
   On Friday, prosecutors called a former clerk in Roberson's
office who identified the handwriting on the form as that of the
defense witness.
   The document is ``a brand-new piece of evidence'' that ``should
not be admitted'' unless the defense is given a chance to dispute
it, Mundy had originally argued.
   Jackson was considering Mundy's request, until the defense
attorney informed the court that he would not be calling either
Roberson or his mother. Mundy had said earlier he wanted to call
Roberson's mother for verification. Roberson had scribbled on the
city document that he was laying a stone for his father's grave.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts opened the day's
proceedings by saying the government would not call any more
rebuttal witnesses.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, three felony charges of lying to a federal grand jury
and one count of conspiracy.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Abortion Law Contested In Federal Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fight over the toughest state abortion
law in the nation entered federal court Monday as a group of
doctors and abortion clinics asked a judge to throw out key
sections of the law.
   The case is being watched by activists on both sides of the
abortion debate because of its potential to present a challenge to
the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that in 1973 established a
woman's right to have an abortion.
   The class-action suit argues that abortion controls passed by
the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1988 and 1989 unconstitutionally
infringe on the rights of women to obtain abortions.
   Among the provisions in dispute are requirements that a woman
notify her husband before obtaining an abortion and that she wait
24 hours between visiting a clinic and receiving an abortion.
   Other contested sections require that doctors provide counseling
to women seeking abortions and that minors obtain the written
consent of one parent or a court order to receive an abortion.
   The law has been temporarily blocked by a federal court order
pending a ruling.
   Only Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, has adopted more
stringent controls. Its law also was temporarily blocked.
   Kathryn Kolbert, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
representing the plaintiffs, said the law allows the state to
interject itself into the private affairs of women and their
doctors, eroding privacy rights established under the Roe ruling.
   ``This act puts government in the operating room and at the
kitchen table with women making decisions on abortion,'' she said.
   ``It questions the ability of women to make independent
decisions,'' she added.
   One doctor testified that criminal penalties in the 1989 law
might deter other physicians from performing abortions. The law, as
revised last year, carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate
its provisions.
   Dr. Thomas Allen of Women's Health Services of Pittsburgh, one
of the clinics filing suit, said malpractice insurance typically
covers civil but not criminal cases.
   ``They are a little more afraid'' of the prospect of criminal
charges, Allen said. ``It may deter some of my colleagues from
providing the service.''
   On cross-examination by Senior Deputy Attorney General Kate L.
Mershimer, Allen acknowledged a 24-hour waiting period might be
necessary in some cases, but added: ``I don't think it should be
mandated.''
   In other testimony, Dr. Michael Alan Grodin of the Boston
University school of medicine and public health expressed concern
with parts of the law requiring ``informed consent.'' He said
information should be provided to a patient on an individual basis
and that the law's requirement intrudes on the doctor-patient
relationship.
   This is the second time Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H.
Huyett III has been called upon to rule on the constitutionality of
the Pennsylvania abortion law.
   Some sections of the law are similar to those ruled
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1986 Pennsylvania
case. That ruling came after Huyett upheld challenges to a 1982
abortion law.
   The state's 1988 law was largely an attempt to redraft many of
the voided provisions. The 1989 law was passed after the Supreme
Court, in a Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, gave states greater leeway to restrict abortion.
   The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pennsylvania; Women's Suburban Clinic; Women's Health
Services; Reproductive Health and Counseling Center; Allentown
Women's Center; and Allen, on behalf of state doctors who perform
or make referrals on abortion.

<HEAD>Jewish Children from Chernobyl to be Treated in Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious movement on Monday announced plans
to bring to Israel 3,000 Jewish children who were exposed to
radiation during the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet
Union.
   ``For the first time since the beginning of Russian immigration,
such a large group of children will come to Israel without their
parents,'' the Chabad movement said in a statement.
   ``Chabad responded to appeals from the parents who have asked
that their children be evacuated from the disaster area and given
proper medical treatment,'' it said.
   The first group, which includes 196 children aged six to 15 from
the Byelorussian cities of Gomel and Mozyr, will arrive Wednesday
by chartered plane, the movement said. They will be accompanied by
35 adults, it said.
   A medical team will first examine the children at Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital, the movement said.
   According to Chabad, five children in the group are known to be
suffering from leukemia as a result of the April 1986 disaster at
the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
   ``The situation of the others is unclear because ever since the
disaster, they have not been checked thoroughly and have not
received any medical treatment,'' Chabad said.
   ``Following their arrival, they will undergo detailed medical
tests and will be under constant observation so that any symptoms
that may develop as a result of their exposure to radiation can be
treated in time.''
   Chabad said a special clinic would be created for the children
at the movement's headquarters in Kfar Chabad.
   ``Chabad will not rest until all the 3,000 children who have
been exposed to radiation are brought to Israel and receive proper
medical treatment,'' the movement's chairman Rabbi Shlomo
Maidanchik said.
   Chabad, an acronym for ``Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge,'' is
a movement of Lubavitcher Hasidim, followers of the New York-based
Lubavitcher Rabbi. Lubavitcher officials claim a million followers
worldwide.
   The movement is historically linked with the town of Lubavitch
in Byelorussia, the Soviet republic that was declared an ecological
disaster site following the Chernobyl accident.

<TEXT>
   A manufacturer of sonar devices for nuclear
submarines pleaded guilty to two felony charges Monday and agreed
to pay $5.1 million to settle a civil suit alleging it overcharged
the Pentagon for labor costs.
   Ametek Inc., pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego,
Calif., to two charges of making false statements to the government
and was fined $110,000, the Justice Department said in a news
release. The company admitted submitting false estimates of labor
costs to the Pentagon, officials said.
   The company, based in Paoli, Pa., also agreed to pay $5.1
million to settle a lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act, the
department said.
   The suit, originally filed by attorney Alan J. Ludecke, charged
that Ametek had inflated labor costs for making two sonar systems
for the Los Angeles-class attack submarines and Trident missile
subs, the department said.
   Under the terms of the settlement, Ludecke will receive $765,000
or 15 percent of the $5.1 million payment. The False Claims Act
allows whistleblowers to bring lawsuits on behalf of the
government. The Justice Department decided to take over the case
and conducted its own investigation of the allegations first
brought to light by Ludecke.
   ``In an era of shrinking military expenditures, we will move to
insure that the government gets what it pays for, said Stuart M.
Gerson, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's civil division.

<HEAD>Angola Claims UNITA Killed 22 Civilians, Sabotaged Oil Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITA rebels in Angola killed 22
civilians, blew up electric pylons and sabotaged 14 oil pipelines,
undermining efforts to end the 15-year-old civil war there, news
reports from Angola said Monday.
   Rebels confirmed sabotage attacks in the southern African
nation, but David Horacio, UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, said
civilians were never a target.
   The United States has backed UNITA, the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, in its fight to force the Marxist
government to share power. War has raged since Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The Angolan news agency ANGOP, in a dispatch monitored in
Lisbon, quoted an unidentified military source as saying rebels
killed 20 villagers, wounded two and burned seven houses in a raid
Thursday in coastal Benguela province.
   Rebels killed two more civilians the same day, one from Namibia,
in an ambush on two vehicles in southern Cunene province, bordering
Namibia, ANGOP said.
   Angolan government sources, quoted by the Portuguese news agency
LUSA, said UNITA blew up electric pylons 100 miles south of Luanda,
leaving the capital without power for the second time in less than
a month.
   The Angolan military said in a statement that rebel attacks on
Angola's oil supply ``are intended to display a false military
superiority but in no way contribute to the advent of peace; on the
contrary, they lead to an escalation of the internal conflict,''
ANGOP reported.
   Oil production at Quinguila in Northwestern Soyo district
bordering Zaire was down 30,000 barrels a day after UNITA destroyed
14 pipelines there, ANGOP said .
   Crude oil is Angola's main source of foreign currency. The
country produced an average 455,000 barrels a day last year and
stands to earn more than $2.5 billion from oil exports this year,
according to Western studies.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal said recently the
two sides may meet in August in Portugal to sign a cease-fire.
   A U.S. State Department official said during a visit to Angola
this month that the the United States will continue to aid the
rebels ``until such time as there is a process for national
reconciliation under way.'' Washington is thought to channel about
$50 million worth of military aid to UNITA, mostly via Zaire.
   Rebel and government delegations met in April and June in
Portugal for peace talks, and both sides said later they were ready
to sign a truce.
   A June 22, 1989, cease-fire brokered by President Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire collapsed within days.

   A former bodyguard for drug traffickers was
convicted Monday of kidnapping and other charges in the
kidnap-slaying of a U.S. drug agent in Mexico, but was acquitted of
murder.
   A U.S. District Court jury found Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez
guilty of kidnapping and racketeering in the 1985 torture killing
of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena.
   The jury also convicted Bernabe, 31, of aiding the escape of
Rafael Caro Quintero, a drug lord whose Guadalajara, Mexico, home
was where Camarena was tortured and slain.
   The government alleges that Caro was among those who
interrogated and killed Camarena in revenge for the agent's raids
on rich marijuana and cocaine plantations.
   According to testimony, Mexican law enforcement officers also
aided Caro's dramatic escape from Guadalajara Airport. Caro was
recaptured, then convicted in Mexico and is one of 20 people
serving sentences there in the complex case.
   In addition to the specific charge of murdering Camarena,
Bernabe was acquitted of conspiracy to kidnap the agent and of
racketeering in the kidnap and murder of Camarena's pilot, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar.
   Bernabe faces up to life in prison for kidnapping and
racketeering and 10 years for the other conviction.
   The former Mexican policeman showed no reaction as he stood with
his lawyers listening to the verdicts on simultaneous-translation
earphones.
   After the verdicts, the jury resumed deliberations on charges
against the two remaining defendants.
   The jury on Thursday convicted Honduran drug kingpin Juan Ramon
Matta Ballesteros of the Camarena kidnapping, but cleared him of a
murder charge. Matta's attorney said the jury was confused.
   Bernabe, who was arrested a year ago and was the only defendant
to testify during the trial, admitted he was a bodyguard for drug
traffickers, but denied any role in Camarena's kidnapping and
murder or Zavala's killing.
   Camarena's slaying by Guadalajara's powerful drug cartel
incensed U.S. drug enforcement officials and strained relations
between the United States and Mexico.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country and
more than 20 convicted in Mexico.
   The trial is the second prosecution in the case. In Los Angeles
in 1988, a drug trafficker and a former Mexican policeman were
convicted in federal court of multiple charges, including murder,
in the Camarena case and another drug trafficker was found guilty
of aiding and abetting the murders.
   Camarena, 31, was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street. According
to testimony at both trials, he was taken to Caro's house, where he
was tortured and interrogated before being slain along with his
pilot. Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles
from Gaudalajara.
   The murders were said to be in retribution for DEA drug seizures
which cost the drug barons $5 billion in profits.
   Judge Edward Rafeedie set Bernabe's sentencing for Sept. 24, and
ordered lawyers to refrain from comment on the case until all
verdicts have been returned.
   The two remaining defendants are Ruben Zuno Arce, a Guadalajara
businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria accused of taking part in Camarena's kidnapping, and
Javier Vasquez Velasco, a former bodyguard accused of slaying two
American tourists in an apparent mistake killing. Neither is
accused of murder.

   Loyalist soldiers of President Samuel
Doe burst into a Lutheran church compound Monday and massacred at
least 600 civilian refugees, including many children, witnesses
said.
   However, State Department officials in Washington said late
Monday that their information, based on reports from U.S. Embassy
staff still in Monrovia, indicates about 200 had been killed by
Liberian troops.
   In either case, a spokesman for Doe denied the allegations. In a
telephone call to the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, the
spokesman said rebels wearing government uniforms killed the
civilians in the early morning raid.
   Witnesses said most victims were children and women, some with
babies strapped to their backs and others cowering in corners. They
had been seeking refuge from the civil war, which began in late
December when rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in a bid
to oust Doe.
   The rebels accuse Doe, in power since 1980, of rights abuses and
corruption.
   People who said they escaped the attack alleged about 30
soldiers blasted the church door down with machines guns. They then
opened fire on about 2,000 people from the Gio and Mano tribes who
had taken refuge there.
   Government troops have killed hundreds of Gios and Manos, whose
tribes have supported the rebels seeking to overthrow Doe and speak
a different language than Doe's loyalists. Most of Doe's troops are
from his Krahn tribe and the Mandingo tribe.
   Earlier Monday, White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart
said U.S. Embassy officials had confirmed government troops
slaughtered at least 200 people at the church compound in Monrovia.
There was no independent confirmation of the 600 dead figure.
   The White House condemned the massacre as a ``senseless act of
terror'' but had no plans to send in troops. ``At this point we
don't believe that would be a prudent course of action,'' Hart said.
   Witnesses said soldiers broke into the church compound at about
2 a.m. when the refugees were asleep. There was no telephone, so
victims had no way of calling for help.
   Bodies of some people apparently killed while trying to flee
were hanging from window frames of the church building, said one
person who visited the camp. ``I saw dead bodies all around,'' the
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other witnesses who refused to give their names said they saw
women with their heads smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets.
   Thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war are crowded into
refugee camps in the capital. Their numbers have swelled recently
as rebel troops have stormed the city.
   The survivors said that after the soldiers had riddled the
refugees on the ground floor with bullets they went upstairs and
attacked a second group, of 1,000, sleeping there.
   ``We thought they had come to ask us questions. Then they
started killing, and everyone began screaming and trying to hide,''
said one man who claimed he hid on the roof of the church.
   The soldiers were from Doe's Krahn tribe, said the survivors.
   The floor of the church was covered with blood stains Monday.
Bodies were huddled under the pews where people tried to hide and
lay draped across the church altar. More bodies were huddled in the
corner.
   The bodies of women were strewn on the floor with children still
wrapped in shawls on their backs. The ceiling was riddled with
bullet holes.
   ``My people, help me. My son, where is my son? I beg you. Don't
leave me,'' pleaded an injured woman on the church steps. A man
nearby, his neck slashed, called out for water.
   The compound was filled with the bodies brought outside after
the massacre. People passing the church appeared numb at the sight
of rows of corpses.
   People who survived the attack were seen Monday afternoon being
rounded up by government soldiers. The soldiers ordered survivors
away from the building and shot into the air to make them move,
said the witnesses.
   Refugees had sought protection at the church in late May after
government soldiers attacked them at U.N. headquarters in Monrovia.
The soldiers killed an unarmed security guard and abducted about 30
civilian men. Many of their bodies were later discovered outside
the capital.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar withdrew all U.N.
staff from Liberia in protest, halting an emergency program to aid
war refugees. Perez de Cuellar said in New York that he reacted
``with horror and dismay'' to Monday's massacre.
   The war has grown to include tribal warfare, with both the
government and rebels accusing the other of civilian slayings.
   The government of neighboring Guinea has accused fighters of
rebel leader Charles Taylor of crossing into its territory and
slaughtering Krahns and Mandingos.
   Meanwhile, Taylor's men are engaged in battles with followers of
a rival rebel leader, Prince Johnson. Johnson split with Taylor
months ago, and his fighters last week advanced to within a mile of
the presidential mansion.
   Taylor has offered to pardon Johnson if he joined in the
struggle to topple Doe.
   Johnson indicated Monday he had no intention of working with
Taylor. In a meeting with foreign correspondents in Monrovia, he
accused Taylor of being a Libyan-backed socialist and said he
received $8 million in aid from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``He is not going to come here now and make himself president. I
will meet Taylor after Doe is overthrown. I don't want power, I
want a fair election. Taylor will manipulate the election,''
Johnson said.
   Johnson, a former lieutenant in Doe's army, said: ``I will get
Doe. He is not going to get away.'' He claimed to have 7,000 men
under his command, including 4,000 deserters from Doe's army.
   Taylor claims to have at least 5,000 fighters. He has denied
receiving aid from Libya.
   Taylor named his own interim government, with himself as the
head, last week.
   Doe, who has repeatedly said he will die before leaving
Monrovia, remained holed up in his heavily fortified presidential
mansion.

   Hundreds of inmates at prisons across France
refused to return to their cells Monday in a new wave of protests
against presidential pardons for five members of a pro-Iranian
assassination team.
   The largest protest was at the Strasbourg-Elsau prison outside
the eastern city of Strasbourg, where about 200 of the 640 inmates
refused to return to their cells after an afternoon walk.
   About 40 protesters climbed atop a roof and refused to come down
until riot police fired tear gas grenades to end the three-hour
rebellion. One inmate suffered unspecified injuries when he fell
from the roof, police said.
   Similar protests began late in the day in at least six other
prisons from Marseille on the south coast to Lille in the
far-north. They followed a series of protests over the weekend by
inmates angered over President Francois Mitterrand's Friday pardon
of Anis Naccache and his four accomplices. Five prison officials
were slightly injured in the weekend protests.
   Naccache had served 10 years of a life sentence for the failed
assassination of Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister prior to
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   A policeman and a passer-by were killed and another policeman
paralyzed in the 1980 assassination attempt in Paris.
   Naccache was allegedly acting on Iranian orders and his
imprisonment has been a major object of contention between France
and Iran.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in an interview Saturday that
he hoped the release could help bring about the freeing of all
Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Three unions representing prison guards issued statements
partially blaming the government for the protests. One of them, the
General Union of Prison Syndicates, said the pardons ``confirm once
again that all men in France are not equal before the law.''
   At the Ormingen prison in eastern France, scores of prisoners
ended an 18-hour mutiny Monday in which they hurled roofing tiles
at riot police, and set fire to the kitchen, gymnasium and prison
shop. Many were armed with iron bars or hand tools.
   The riot police did not intervene, and the inmates gave up at
midday Monday following hours of negotiations with prison officials.
   No promises were made to the prisoners, officials said. They
could not immediately provide an estimate of the damages caused to
the facility.
   There were also protests at Caen, where the five prison
employees were slightly injured Saturday. The inmates there,
demanding pardons of their own, had chanted, ``Us, too. Us, too.''
   The Paris newspaper Le Monde reported Monday that Iran may also
be seeking the release of two other men serving life prison terms
in France: Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, a Lebanese convicted in 1987
of complicity in the assassinations of diplomats from the United
States and Israel, and Varoujan Garbidjian, an Armenian convicted
of a 1983 bombing at Orly airport which killed eight people.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor on Monday left the
media-besieged jail where she chose to spend her 72-hour sentence
for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer, virtually ending her
publicity-mad misdemeanor case.
   Surrounded by about 100 reporters and onlookers and at least one
heckler who told her to go back to Hungary, Miss Gabor, 72, said
she spent her jail time doing secretarial work that was slightly
hampered by her ignorance of the alphabet.
   ``I had to file, but I don't know the ABCs, so they wrote out
the ABCDE for me,'' she said outside the jail. ``I did very well.''
   Miss Gabor said that on returning to her Bel-Air home, ``I want
to take a hot bath and talk to my dogs and my horses.''
   Retired custodian Fred DeGrazio, 72, of Hawthorne documented the
release with a video camera and running commentary. ``I have
nothing else to do,'' he explained.
   ``She should go back to Hungary and be the aristocrat she thinks
she is,'' he said shortly before Miss Gabor's release.
   ``Why don't you jump in a coffin?'' snapped her husband,
Frederick Von Anhalt, who says he's a prince. Von Anhalt, Miss
Gabor's eighth husband, said the previous 72 hours had been tough
on him.
   ``My weekend was terrible. My wife, she wasn't home,'' he
complained.
   On Friday, Miss Gabor began her 72-hour sentence for slapping a
policeman during a traffic stop last year.
   She paid $85 a day to do her time at the El Segundo jail rather
than have the county pick accommodations for her.
   ``I was very happily surprised,'' she said of her stay in the
Los Angeles suburb known for its refineries and aerospace offices
and factories. ``Everybody was warm and nice and sweet. It was OK.
The Beverly Hills Police should come and take lessons from this
police.''
   But there was that moment of terror.
   ``At first I was petrified,'' she said. ``They even took my
makeup away.'' She also scolded reporters for a weekend story that
her husband delivered silk sheets to the jail.
   ``I didn't have silk sheets. I don't even have silk sheets at
home. I was on a horse blanket,'' she said.
   She also declared the food to be ``terrible.''
   Among other accomplishments during the 72 hours, Miss Gabor
claimed she finished writing her autobiography, ``One Lifetime is
Not Enough.''
   One jail stay was enough for the El Segundo Police.
   ``This is so time-consuming,'' Lt. L. Lunsford said Sunday,
after handling about 60 telephone calls from people with inquiring
minds.
   Municipal Judge Charles Rubin ordered the jail sentence last May
after ruling Miss Gabor had violated probation by failing to
perform 120 hours of community service at a shelter for homeless
women. He increased the community-service time to 145{ hours.
   Along with her jail time and community service, Rubin ordered
Miss Gabor to pay nearly $13,000 in fines and restitution.
   Miss Gabor's attorney, Harrison Bull of Santa Barbara, said
finishing the jail sentence completes the sometime actress' debt to
society.
   ``I filed notice of completion last week. I am going to say she
completed more than 200 hours of community service,'' considerably
more than she was asked to do, said Bull.
   Of the $13,000 in fines, $10,000 has been paid and the rest will
be paid this week, he said.
   ``This is probably the biggest sentence ever served by anyone
for such a minor incident in the history of United States
jurisprudence,'' Bull said with the understatement that has marked
the case.

<HEAD>Nautical Tribute Kicks Off Queen Mother Birthday Festivities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTSMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nautical tribute by 2,000 yachts on
Monday kicked off six days of festivities celebrating the 90th
birthday of Britain's favorite grandmother, the Queen Mother.
   From the deck of the Royal Yacht Britannia, Queen Elizabeth
reviewed yachts passing in the waters separating the mainland from
the Isle of Wight. Among the boats was a ketch representing the New
York Yacht Club.
   Crews cheered and doffed their caps on boats decked out in
brilliant flags and pennants, a splash of color against the misty
evening sky.
   The Queen Mother, consistently listed in opinion polls as the
public's favorite member of the royal family, arrived at Portsmouth
to a 21-gun salute as she went on board the Britannia.
   Since Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married into the royal family on
April 23, 1923, she has captivated her subjects with her joie de
vivre, breathtaking energy and indelible charm.
   She comforted England during the darkest days of World War II
and inspired courage by refusing to leave King George V in England
for safe haven with their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret.
   Many people say the highlight of this week's celebrations will
be the Queen Mother's visit Wednesday to the East End, the
neighborhoods hardest hit by German bombs during the blitz.
   On Wednesday night, the Queen Mother will return to the
Britannia to watch a firework display over the Thames River and
attend a birthday dinner given by her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.
   There are no official engagements Thursday, although Prince
Charles has arranged a special concert for his grandmother at
Buckingham Palace. After a quiet day Friday, the Queen Mother is
expected to celebrate her Aug. 4 birthday at her London home,
Clarence House.
   However, as in recent years, the Queen Mother can expect to see
a good-humored crowd outside her home from the crack of dawn,
bursting into choruses of ``Happy Birthday'' and eager to give her
flowers and presents.
   She usually appears to accept gifts from children in the crowd.

<HEAD>Foresters Call For Radically Broader View of Research, More Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest collection of forestry
scientists called Monday for radical changes in forest research,
pleading for more money, more graduate students and a broader view
of the globe's ecosystem.
   The Society of American Foresters embraced proposed changes of a
new report by the National Research Council, an affiliate of the
National Academy of Science.
   ``By and large, the current extent and direction of forestry
research is insufficient to answer today's pressing problems or
those of the future,'' said Arthur Smyth, president of the society
and its nearly 20,000 members.
   ``We are facing serious environmental questions about global
warming and biodiversity. Yet, we find our country's commitment to
forestry research is eroding, just when we most need to understand
and look for solutions to these pressing concerns,'' he said.
   The report presented at the society's annual convention in
Washington concludes that current forestry research is ``inadequate
to meet society's needs.''
   Support for research, physical facilities and research equipment
is lagging and ``because funding has not kept pace with changing
technology, the technology used in forestry research and teaching
is rarely up to date.''
   ``The number of scientists and amount of resources devoted to
forestry research have declined significantly and are continuing to
decline, even as needs increase,'' the study said.
   The report recommends the Forest Service's research budget be
increased by 10 percent annually over the next five years, from the
1988 level of $135 million to a total of $218 million. It also
suggests the Agriculture Department make available $100 million
annually in competitive grants for research.
   Jerry Sesco, deputy chief of research for the Agriculture
Department's Forest Service, said forest research has been
conducted by scientists with specific expertise in such areas as
water, timber and wildlife.
   ``We need more at the interdisciplinary, ecosystem level. It
goes back to the first Earth Day when we said everything is related
to everything else. We are finding that is true more and more,'' he
said.
   ``Basically, we don't know very much about how ecosystems
operate. We need to understand better how people and natural
resources integrate,'' Sesco said.
   The committee that prepared information for the report was
chaired by John C. Gordon of Yale University. Other members
included William Atkinson of Oregon State University, Jerry
Franklin and David Thorud of the University of Washington and James
Sedell of the Forest Service in Corvallis, Ore.

   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across much of the nation
Monday, causing flooding in Texas and threatening more high water.
Flooding continued in northeastern Iowa.
   In western Texas, the town of Alpine received 2 inches of rain
between 4 a.m. and noon, flooding low-water crossings and railroad
tracks to the west.
   A flood watch was posted for the mountains of western Texas
between the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend.
   Summer rains caused major flooding over the weekend in the
northeastern Iowa town of Finchford on the west fork of the Cedar
River.
   The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter at junior high school
in nearby Cedar Falls, but no one had shown up by Monday afternoon.
   The flood's crest was expected to reach Waterloo, about 10 miles
downstream from Finchford, on Monday, and Cedar Rapids, about 50
miles from Finchford, on Thursday. But the National Weather Service
predicted flooding downstream would be less serious.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell Monday in sections of Texas, New
Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Lower
Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Georgia and northwest
Florida. Scattered showers and storms fell over east-central and
southern Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Virginia and Maine.
   The mercury dropped to 41 degrees in Alamosa, Colo., breaking
the city's low-temperature record for the date of 42 degrees in
1979 and 1986.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees in Arcata, Calif., to 108 in Needles, Calif.
   The low for the nation was 38 degrees in Yellowstone National
Park, Wyo.

<TEXT>
   The owner of a huge arsenal remaind at
large Monday after police siezed more than 500 guns and an antitank
gun from his duplex.
   An arrest warrant was issued for Henry Stram, 50, said police
Lt. Richard Bongiorno. The arrest warrant alleges illegal
possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of infernal
machines and possession of explosive fireworks.
   ``We believe he's on Cape Cod,'' Bongiorno said, adding that
police were cooperating with authorities there.
   Two weekend raids at Stram's home in a residential section of
Cambridge yielded more than 200 handguns, 300 rifles, an antitank
gun, antique guns, mortar shells and ``thousands and thousands of
rounds of ammunition,'' said Lt. Donald Carney.
   Police said the firepower in the home was enough to outgun the
department.
   Stram is licensed to carry firearms and was known to neighbors
as a gun collector and a member of the National Guard. Police
seized his entire collection, citing public safety concerns.
   ``That amount of guns, it's unheard of,'' said Carney.
``Especially in a house in the middle of the city. If anyone broke
in and took the guns ... it would wreak havoc on the streets.''
   Police went to the house because of a reported break-in. The
report proved wrong.
   The weapons were estimated to be worth about $150,000, Bongiorno
said.
   Since 1960, Stram, a lifelong Cambridge resident, has been a
member of the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing of the Massachusetts
Air National Guard at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod, according to
Doug Karson, an Otis spokesman.

<TEXT>
   Armando Frid, a horse tamer and
cattle driver in the early stages of a life said to have spanned
124 years, has died, the government news agency Telam said Monday.
   Telam put Frid's date of birth as May 24, 1866, in Vega de
Maipu, in the western province of Neuquen.
   The 1989 Guinness Book of World Records lists the greatest
authenticated age of any human as 120 years, 237 days. Shigechiyo
Izumi of Japan died at that age in 1986.
   Hector Colla, the agency's correspondent in Viedma, near the
rural town in Rio Negro province where Frid died, said he knew Frid
and examined birth documents that government officials confirmed as
genuine.
   Colla spoke in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   An editor at the newspaper Rio Negro also told The AP by
telephone that Frid attained 124 years of age two months ago,
according to checks the paper made in the past about a resident who
was considered a celebrity.
   Colla said Frid died last Saturday at his home in Carmen de
Patagones, about 600 miles south of Buenos Aires and 2{ miles
outside Viedma.
   Townspeople gave Frid a party on his 110th birthday because they
figured he wouldn't have many more, Colla said. But Frid told them,
``eating grilled beef and drinking mate, I'll keep on living.''
   Mate is a bitter tea, served hot or cold, that is a popular
drink in Argentina. Beef cooked over an open flame is the national
dish, in plentiful supply even to the poor.
   Among many jobs, Frid hunted foxes and pumas, raised horses and
worked as an oil hand in Patagonia. His last job was as a baker in
Buenos Aires, Telam said.

<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden under a car exploded
Monday, killing a Conservative Party lawmaker and confidante of the
prime minister who was on an Irish Republican Army assassination
list, police said.
   Ian Gow, chairman of the Northern Ireland committee in the House
of Commons, died of injuries minutes after turning the ignition key
in his car outside his house, authorities said.
   Scotland Yard's chief anti-terrorist officer, George
Churchill-Coleman, said the attack appeared to be the work of the
IRA. No one else was injured, and no one immediately claimed
responsibility.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher viewed the car, with its roof
on the driver's side peeled back and all the glass blown out.
   ``I could talk to him like nobody else,'' she said of Gow after
visiting his wife.
   Gow, 53, had been warned he was on a list of 100 lawmakers,
judges and civil servants found in an IRA bomb factory in south
London in December 1988, Churchill-Coleman said.
   Friends and neighbors in Hankham, on England's southeast coast,
said Gow took few precautions. ``It would be easy for terrorists to
get him,'' said Jane Birch, a neighbor.
   It appeared that a device packing about five pounds of
explosives was placed under the driver's seat, set to go off when
the ignition was turned on, Churchill-Coleman said.
   ``My impression is that it was some sort of tilt switch. Once
you turn it on, it explodes immediately,'' he said.
   Gow was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary private
secretary from 1979 to 1983. He was also a close family friend and
political ally to whom she turned for advice in moments of
difficulty.
   Gow resigned from her government in 1985 to protest the
Anglo-Irish Agreement which guaranteed Ireland a say in the
province's affairs. He saw the accord as undermining British
authority in Northern Ireland.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and Britain's Roman
Catholic Cardinal Basil Hume joined politicians in condemning the
attack, the fourth slaying of a British lawmaker since sectarian
violence broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969.
   The IRA has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in
England, including one on May 16 that killed Sgt. Charles Chapman
at a British army recruiting office.
   Other recent targets have included London's Stock Exchange, the
Carlton Club, a traditional Conservative Party watering hole, the
Stock exchange and a Royal Air Force base in northwest London.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the killing and
offered condolences to Gow's family.
   Gow's killers were ``plain, common murderers,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said after spending nearly an hour with Gow's wife, Jane, at the
couple's home near Eastbourne, 60 miles southeast of London.
   Mrs. Thatcher went to a special private service for Gow.
   She said the Gows and their two sons spent some Christmases with
the Thatchers and that the families were close.
   The prime minister, who narrowly escaped an IRA bombing that
killed five at a hotel in Brighton during a Conservative Party
meeting in October 1984, said public officials should take all
precautions suggested by Scotland Yard.
   ``Most (members of parliament) want to lead an open life, but I
must renew the plea in view of what happened here in a quiet
village _ everyone must have regard for their own stafety and the
safety of their staff and family,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Police scoured the area trying to discover whether the bombers
stayed in the locale before the attack.
   Nearly a dozen bouquets of flowers were placed near the gate to
the drive. The large brick house stands behind a high wall across
the street from a primary school, closed for summer vacation.
   ``I think if Ian had been here he would have been the first to
say, as he did on countless other occasions when such atrocities
occurred, we should not give in to intimidation,'' said
Conservative lawmaker Charles Wardle. ``It is vitally important
that nothing should change people's minds _ no atrocity, no murder,
no bullying.''
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, called the
slaying ``a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offense was
to speak his mind.''
   Last Tuesday, after an IRA bomb killed three police officers and
a nun in Northern Ireland, Gow expressed his anger at IRA tactics.
   ``These murders are as odious as they are futile,'' he said.
``Once again, wives have been turned into widows and children into
orphans, and for what purpose?''
   In a June 28 issue of Republican News, the weekly newspaper of
the IRA, a leader said the group was determined ``to hit the enemy
on as many fronts as possible and to stretch their resources and
nerves.''
   ``England is the `belly of the beast' and that is where it hurts
most,'' the unidentified IRA leader said.

<DATELINE>VENLO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven residents of an old people's
home died and 10 others were hospitalized after eating a
salmonella-infected pudding containing raw eggs, Dutch TV reported
Monday.
   It said 15 other residents at the Maria Auxiliatrix home for the
elderly suffered minor symptoms after eating the desert last
Tuesday. The house had 265 residents.
   Salmonella are bacteria that can develop in some foodstuffs or
under unhygienic conditions and cause severe food poisoning. The
Health Ministry last year warned against giving raw eggs to the
elderly because of the risk of samonella poisoning.
   The TV report quoted Harry Speentjes, director of the
Martinushof home, which is affiliated with Maria Auxiliatrix, as
saying raw eggs were not supposed to be used in any food served at
the institution because of the warning.
   The first fatality occured Thursday, but the case was not made
public until Monday, when the cause of the deaths was established,
the report said.
   Speentjes was also quoted as saying that all the victims were
over 80 and all were suffering from terminal illnesses.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Armed Services subcommittee voted
Monday to eliminate all $3.8 billion in procurement money President
Bush had sought for the B-2 bomber, lawmakers said.
   The panel on procurement and military nuclear systems adopted
the proposal of its chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., to stop
buying the stealth aircraft after the 15 planes currently under
development are delivered to the Air Force.
   The Armed Services' subcommittee on research and development
meets Tuesday to take up the president's requets for money for B-2
testing. The full committee meets later in the day to put the
finishing touches on its $283 billion defense bill for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
   In other action behind closed doors, the panel eliminated the
$1.3 billion the Pentagon sought for the program to move the MX
nuclear missile from fixed silos to railroad cars and zeroed out
the $1.3 billion for the AMRAAM anti-aircraft missile.
   Rejecting Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's attempts to kill the
V-22 Osprey, the House panel added $165 million for advance
procurement of the tilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like
a helicopter but can fly like a plane.
   The panel also restricted the purchase of the C-17 transport
aircraft, requiring Cheney to certify that the plane's first
successful flight has been demonstrated before some $350 million
can be spent on the two planes sought in the new fiscal year. The
administration had proposed spending $2.1 billion on the C-17, a
hevay transport designed to land on fields that the gigantic C-5
models cannot use.
   The panel slashed $1.2 billion from the classified A-12 Navy
attack aircraft program.
   The subcommittee's action on the B-2 reflected the eroding
congressional support for the aircraft, which is manufactured by
the Northrop Corp. Lawmakers have expressed sticker shock over the
cost of a single plane _ nearly $865 million.
   The B-2 still has substantial support in the Senate.
   A serious blow to the program came last week when Aspin,
chairman of the House Armed Services panel, came out for winding up
the program despite attempts by the administration to make the
project more appealing to lawmakers.
   Cheney revised his plan for the aircraft in April, cutting the
total number of planes to be bought from 132 to 75 and reducing the
buy in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 from five to two.
   In the closed session, the panel by voice vote rejected an
amendment by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., to include $200 million for
future procurement of the stealth bomber.
   Instead, the subcommittee followed Aspin's lead and zeroed out
$3.8 billion for procurement of the two planes.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasters said minimal hurricane Bertha could
reach the Canadian provinces by Wednesday but was mainly of concern
to marine interests.
   Bertha, which was downgraded Sunday night to a tropical storm
after it temporarily weakened, regained enough strength to push it
just over the hurricane threshold of 74 mph.
   At 6 p.m. EDT Monday, Bertha was centered near 36 degrees 5
minutes north latitude and 67 degrees 4 minutes west longitude.
That is 600 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia, said
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables. It had top sustained winds of 75 mph and was moving
northeast at 14 mph.
   Bertha was expected to stay at the same strength, course and
speed through early Tuesday, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   Earlier, Bertha kicked up surf along Carolina beaches and sent
gusts up to about 45 mph toward Bermuda. But forecasters said that
because it was already edging northeast toward the open Atlantic
when it was born, it was never much of a threat.
   The first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic season could reach the
Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland by Wednesday or
Thursday, forecasters said.

   Fire devastated Naples' new courthouse
Monday, turning the 32-story building into a glass inferno. One
firefighter was slightly injured.
   The fire was discovered on the 7th floor of the 360-foot tower,
the tallest in a three-building complex that was to have been
completed the end of this year. Construction of the building began
in 1979.
   The cause of the fire, which resulted in an estimated $1 billion
worth of damage, is under investigation.
   ``So far, nothing has emerged that points to arson,'' said Enzo
Mauro, a deputy at the district police station. The construction
company, however, excluded the possibility that the origin of the
fire was electrical.
   Firefighters were hindered in their efforts to extinguish the
rapidly-spreading fire because of the heavy shower of debris that
rained down as sections of the iron-and-glass tower collapsed.
   An automatic fire-extinguishing system had been designed for the
building, but was not yet functional.
   Officials had hoped the opening of the new judicial complex
would help alleviate a huge backlog of criminal cases, many
involving the Neapolitan Mafia.

   A red, four-door Saturn sedan piloted
by retiring General Motors Chairman Roger Smith rolled off the
assembly line Monday, ceremonially but secretly kicking off
production of the ground-breaking car.
   GM said that Smith, who retires Tuesday after 9{ years as GM's
chairman, drove and United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber
rode shotgun when the ``Job One'' of the new GM model came off the
line.
   Smith had promised he would drive ``Job One'' off Saturn's
assembly line before he retired.
   But after seven years of media hype since the project was
announced, the ceremony was closed to the news media.
   A photographer at Monday's ceremony was barred from taking
pictures of the entire vehicle, reporters wre kept outside the
plant gates and departing employees refused to answer questions.
The company has yet to officially release a picture of the car but
so-called ``spy photos'' have been published.
   In contrast, when Nissan began making light trucks in 1983 in
Smyrna, 25 miles to the northeast, its ``Job One'' ceremony was a
carefully produced affair with speeches, a film of the plant's
history and open access for the news media.
   Richard G. ``Skip'' LeFauve, GM Saturn's president, said in a
news release that Saturn's ceremony was private because of GM's
plans to focus national attention on the car's launch this fall. He
said it also provided a chance for team members to talk with Smith.
   ``Without Roger, there wouldn't be a Saturn,'' he said.
   The Saturn project was envisioned as a way of using
non-traditional production and management techniques to make cars
that would compete with imports that steadily have eaten away GM's
U.S. market share.
   Smith introduced the project in 1983 saying the company planned
to annually make 500,000 subcompact cars, costing about $6,000 each
and getting mileage of 60 miles per gallon.
   The final product actually has more interior room, a longer
wheel base and more features. It now is aimed to compete with the
Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, with a $10,000 to $12,000 price tag
and a smaller 35-mpg rating. Production estimates have been halved.
   Smith's promise to drive ``Job One'' off the assembly line
before he retired also was modified. When pressed recently if he
would be able to keep his promise, Smith and Saturn officials said
he would drive the car only if it was ready for production.
   ``Production is coming on line, retail facilities are under
construction, and we can't wait to get to the marketplace this
fall,'' said LeFauve.
   Behind Smith and Bieber was incoming GM Chairman Robert Stempel
in the ``Job Two'' Saturn.
   Saturn officials said they will not begin shipping cars until
the fall, shortly before they go on sale in October.

<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco, who completes
his term in office next week, will become Colombia's next
ambassador to Britain, according to a radio report Monday.
   The Caracol radio network, citing ``reliable sources,'' said
Barco will become Colombia's next ambassador in London when
President-elect Cesar Gaviria takes office Aug. 7.
   Neither the presidential palace nor Gaviria's office would
confirm the report.
   Outgoing presidents and cabinet ministers have in the past been
given diplomatic posts abroad, often to give them more security.
   Members of the Barco administration have been under continual
threat from Colombia's violent drug traffickers.
   Those threats intensified last August when drug lords declared
war on the Colombian establishment.

<HEAD>Panel: Honecker Unfit to be Held but Fit to be Tried</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich
Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be
tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
   ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was
still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was
not well enough to be incarcerated.
   But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition
to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.
   Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was
ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept
the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist
government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
   The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist
officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all
fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
   It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, former
economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch
were under arrest, while the other four remained free. All three
had been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker. Mielke was
arrested on Thursday.
   Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of
office. They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were
later released because of advanced age and poor health.
   Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside
East Berlin.
   ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he
intended to continue his investigation against the former East
German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the
proceedings.

<HEAD>Senate Wants Taxpayer Checkoff to Finance TV Campaign Ads</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES vote on GOP amendment; edits throughout to tighten;
no pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

   The Senate on Monday voted to use $20 million
in public money for Senate candidates' TV commercials, drawing on
the presidential campaign fund supported by the $1 checkoff on
individual income tax returns.
   Republicans called the proposal a ``food stamp voucher for
politicians'' that would open the door to taxpayer financing to pay
most of the cost of congressional campaigns as it does now with
presidential elections.
   ``Underneath the hood, it's the same old lemon running on
taxpayer financing and spending limits,'' said Kentucky Sen. Mitch
McConnell, the leading Republican opponent to the Democratic bill.
   By a 49-46 vote, the Senate rejected a Republican amendment that
would delete from a campaign finance reform bill a measure to give
Senate nominees $180,000 to $1.1 million each in government
vouchers to buy broadcasting time for abiding by voluntary spending
ceilings demanded by Democrats.
   All 44 Republicans present voted for the amendment by McConnell.
Democrats Howell Heflin of Alabama and James Exxon of Nebraska also
bolted from their party to support it.
   Beginning debate on campaign finance reform that both parties
claim to want to address a growing public cynicism about politics
in the wake of the savings and loan scandal, Democrats and
Republicans remained at logger heads over the idea of spending
ceilings.
   Majority Democrats, as they have for years, continued to insist
on state-by-state limits on how much candidates can raise and spend
to win or keep Senate seats.
   ``Anything short of that only creates the appearance of
reform,'' said Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine. ``That's
the central issue dividing the two parties.''
   Republicans last week offered to accept ``flexible ceilings''
exempting in-state contributions and gifts from out-of-state donors
less than $200 but Democrats rejected anything less than an
absolute aggregate ceiling.
   Republicans contended Monday any bill limiting spending would
stifle challengers and allow Democrats to maintain control of both
houses of Congress.
   ``Everybody knows this is not going anywhere because it's a
spending-limit bill that the president will not sign,'' said Senate
GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Dole said Republicans would not attempt to filibuster the bill
as they did two years ago, successfully beating back eight attempts
by Democrats to have the chamber vote on it.
   Both sides acknowledged that any agreement with President Bush
is not likely until Congress returns from its August vacation.
   In addition to the public financing of vouchers, the Democratic
bill also provides discount mail subsidies to candidates abiding by
the spending limits as well as funds to counter broadcast ads by
independent groups costing over $10,000.
   Additional public financing would also be provided to candidates
whose opponents exceed the voluntary spending ceilings.
   McConnell's amendment would have eliminated all those potential
public sources of money in the bill.
   In the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he hopes to bring
widely different versions of campaign-reform measures to the floor
before the House recesses at week's end.
   Unlike the Senate versions, two Democratic alternatives and a
Republican version in the House would all diminish the role of
labor, corporate and trade association PACs but would not eliminate
them. Like their Senate counterparts, House Democrats are insisting
on spending ceilings while House Republicans oppose them.
   ``I think we might have to consider having separate procedures
for the House and Senate,'' said Foley, a Washington Democrat .
``Obviously some features applying to state parties would have to
be consolidated.''
   House Democrats would establish a spending ceiling of $550,000,
roughly half the average spent by winners in the 1988 House
elections.
   The Democratic-proposed limits on Senate races _ based on the
size of a state's voting-age population _ range from slightly under
$2 million in smaller states, such as Nevada, Montana and North
Dakota, to $10.3 million in the largest state, California.
   Mitchell attempted to refute Republican claims that a spending
ceiling would benefit incumbents and maintain a Democratic majority.
   ``Any limits will benefit challengers because incumbents have
the greatest access to money,'' Mitchell said, citing the 1986 and
1988 Senate elections, in which incumbents outspent challengers in
51 of 55 races by a total of more than $100 million.
   Republicans countered that six successful challengers in those
elections _ four Republicans and two Democrats _ spent more than
the Democratic bill would allow.
   Senate Democrats bowed to Republicans in agreeing to abolish
PACs Friday and agreed to remove from their bill a public-financing
provision that would have financed up to 70 percent of a
candidate's general election campaign through a voluntary taxpayer
checkoff.
   Republicans, for example, want to disallow the use of free
``franked'' mail by incumbent senators in election years and
prohibit such efforts as the $45-million, union-sponsored 1988
voter-registration and get-out-the-vote drive _ which mostly
benefited Democrats.

   The State Department said Monday there are no
plans for U.S. military intervention to bring an end to the
Moslem-led insurrection against the elected government in Trinidad.
   While refusing comment on reports of U.S. military maneuvers in
the area, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher suggested that a
military solution had been ruled out.
   At the same time, Boucher criticized Libya's involvement with
the rebels, saying it has provided some training for the
insurgents. But he said there was no apparent direct link between
Libya and hostage-taking which occurred last Friday.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and capturing
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Robinson and one other goverment minister were believed to have
been shot in the leg early in the coup attempt, and both have been
getting medical attention, said Bernard W. Aronson, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Trinidad government spokesman Gregory Shaw identified the second
victim as Justice Minister Selwyn Richardson, and said both men
were in stable condition. Shaw said Robinson had been shot in both
feet, not the legs
   Aronson, who spoke in an interview on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' on the Public Broadcasting System, also said people were
killed in the coup attempt but said the department did not have a
figure on the casualties. He said none of them was a high-ranking
government official, but he declined to identify the victims
further.
   The Trinidad crisis has some of the earmarks of the situation in
Grenada seven years ago when a radical leftist movement took power.
In that case, the United States and several other Caribbean
countries decided to oust the radicals.
   As in Grenada, the insurgents have shown a willingness to use
extremist methods to advance their cause.
   In both Grenada and Trinidad, there were signs of involvement by
anti-American elements from abroad. In Grenada, the leadership
there had close links to Cuba while in Trinidad, Libya has been
allied with the rebels. Also, in both cases, a major concern of
Washington has been the well being of thousands of Americans
residing in the two countries.
   But a major difference between the two situations is that
whereas virtually all of the Americans in Grenada were students at
a medical school, the 6,000 Americans in Trinidad are dispersed
around the island and are less vulnerable to a mass hostage-taking.
   The international political climate also has undergone a
dramatic transformation since 1983, a period when Cold War tensions
were at a peak.
   There is little indication that the events in Trinidad will have
an impact beyond that country's borders. This was not the case in
1983, when members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
asked for the dispatch of U.S. troops.
   Beyond that, American officials said government officials in
Trinidad have indicated a desire to resolve the crisis without
outside help.

<HEAD>House Passes Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House acted Monday to protect the Grand
Canyon from any further damage from the hydro-electric functions of
the nearby Glen Canyon Dam.
   A bill approved by voice vote directs the Interior Department to
operate the dam on the Colorado River in Arizona in a such a way
that natural, cultural and recreational resources downstream in the
Grand Canyon are protected or improved.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., sponsor of the bill, said that for
more than 25 years the dam has been diverting water through power
turbines upstream of Grand Canyon at times of peak electricity
demand.
   This has caused fluctuations in water flow that has hurt
wildlife in the canyon and frequently left rafters stranded on sand
bars, conservationists argued.
   Enviornmentalists filed lawsuits demanding that the Interior
Department do an environmental impact statement analyzing dam
operations. In 1988, a six-year study concluded that the dam was
damaging the canyon environment, and last July the Interior
Department announced that it would prepare the environmental impact
statement.
   ``The current management of this dam is a national
embarrassement,'' Miller said. ``The primary purpose of this bill
is to take immediate and lasting steps to protect the resources of
the Grand Canyon.''
   Miller's bill requires the Interior Department to take interim
steps, pending completion of the impact statement, to protect the
environment and mitigate and damage that has already taken place.
   It directs the department to take long-term steps for operation
of the dam after the impact statement is completed.
   The bill still must be approved by the Senate.

<HEAD>Palestinian Youth Dies from Gunshot Wound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old Palestinian boy died Monday from
a gunshot wound suffered in a clash with Israeli soldiers in the
occupied West Bank, and Israeli authorities said two separate Arab
guerrilla cells have been uncovered.
   In Monday's clashes in the occupied territories, 10 Palestinians
were wounded, Arab reporters said. The army confirmed three wounded
and said it was checking further.
   Arab reports identified the shooting victim as Saher Baarah, 15,
of the West Bank city of Nablus, who was shot in the head Saturday
night. Baarah died Monday at the Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv.
   The army confirmed that a Palestinian had died from a plastic
bullet wound sustained during clashes Saturday with stone-throwing
Arab demonstrators in Nablus.
   Baarah's death brought the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli gunfire during the 31-month-old uprising against Israeli
occupation to 725.
   At least 242 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most
as suspected collaborators. Forty-five Israelis have also died in
the violence.
   Also in Nablus, the military and the Shin Bet security service
uncovered a guerrilla hideout used by a group calling itself the
Revolutionary Security Service, affiliated with Yasser Arafat's
Fatah wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the army said.
   The hideout, a well-concealed cave dug under a house, contained
a rifle and machine gun, four pistols, a large amount of
ammunition, knives and other military equipment, the army said.
   Investigators also found two identity cards belonging to Arabs
killed as suspected collaborators this year. Another identity card
found in the cave belonged to a Palestinian who was badly wounded
by an axe last April, the army said.
   The group has attacked and violently interrogated dozens of
Palestinians it suspected of collaborating with Israel during the
uprising, the army said.
   Eleven members of the group were captured in Nablus last month.
   Israeli authorities also released information about another
Fatah guerrilla cell whose six members _ all Israeli Arabs _ were
indicted by a military court in Lod last week.
   The indictment alleged the cell, led by Khaled Hassan Canaan
from the village of Tamra in western Galilee, planted bombs in two
Haifa shopping centers and on a beach in the northern town of
Nahariya the past year. None of the bombs caused any injuries or
damage.
   The indictment said Fatah had recruited Canaan while he was
studying law in West Germany two years ago.
   It alleged that the group received orders from high-ranking
Fatah officials in West Germany and Yugoslavia.
   Israeli officials said they had passed information on this Fatah
cell to the United States.
   Arafat, the PLO chairman, renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist in December 1988, opening the way to direct
talks with the United States.
   The U.S. administration suspended those talks in June after
Arafat failed to discipline the PLO faction responsible for a
foiled seaborne raid on a Tel Aviv beach.

   The House approved a bill Monday that would

   The legislation, approved by a voice vote, would authorize the

telephone subscribers who object to the unsolicited messages.
   The FCC also would establish penalties for advertisers who call
people oin the list.
   ``This legislation empowers consumers and businesses with the
ability to `just say no' to unsolicited telephone advertisements,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Solicitations by charitable and political organizations would be
exempt from the ban.
   Consumers, either private individuals or businesses, could
specify that they do not wish to receive advertising by FAX
machines or automatically dialed, prerecorded telephone
solicitations.
   The legislation was crafted in conjunction with the FCC, the
telephone industry and the direct marketing industry, Markey said.
The Senate still must approve it.

service to South Florida, home to a Nicaraguan community estimated
at between 80,000 and 150,000.

   A man rescued Monday 14 days after an
earthquake buried him in the basement of a luxury hotel said that
while trapped in the darkness he often wished he were dead and even
tried to kill himself.
   Pedrito Dy, a cook and part-time fitness instructor, was the
third survivor pulled since Friday from the ruins of the Hyatt
Hotel in the northern resort of Baguio. He is one of the longest
survivors of an earthquake on record.
   Dy, 27, was flown to Manila for medical treatment. One doctor,
Raul Morena, said Dy's athletic build protected him from serious
injury in the July 16 quake that killed about 1,600 people. Doctors
said he suffered only from dehydration and low blood sugar, which
caused disorientation.
   Dy spent a peaceful night at Manila's Makati Medical Center,
where he was being fed dextrose and a soft diet, doctors said
Tuesday. They said Dy's blood sugar levels had returned to normal.
   Speaking from his hospital bed on Monday, Dy said that while
trapped he lay on his back beneath a cushion, which protected him
from the debris that shifted repeatedly in aftershocks.
   He said he survived by drinking urine and rainwater.
   ``I drank my urine, sometimes drops of rainwater,'' Dy said. ``I
caught water with my mouth and scooped urine with the palm of my
hand. For 13 days, I was telling myself I would die.''
   Dy's voice was barely audible. His eyes were glazed and his
conversation rambled from recollection to recollection without
concern for the subject or sequence of time.
   Dy said he finished his shift as a cook at the 350-room hotel
and headed for the basement gymnasium to lead about a dozen
employees in an afternoon workout.
   Suddenly, the building shook and the force of the temblor hurled
him against an exercise cushion hanging on a wall. The wall
collapsed. But the cushion shielded him from serious injury.
   While trapped, Dy said he was aware of the passage of time
because a clock that had hung on the gym wall continued operating.
It struck every noon and midnight.
   ``On the 13th day I told myself I wish I were dead,'' he said.
``I attempted to kill myself two times. I banged my head on the
wall. ... I prayed constantly to the Virgin Mary and gave my life
up to the Lord. Then I wasn't scared anymore.''
   On Sunday, Dy heard noises. It was the tapping of Filipino
miners tunneling through the debris, searching for survivors. He
called out for help.
   Alex Fongafong, a miner for PHILEX Mining Corp., heard the
cries. Wedging himself through a narrow tunnel, the miner found a
small triangular opening. Peering inside, he saw Dy lying on his
back.
   ``We'll come back for you and we will bring you out,'' Fongafong
shouted. He returned later with mining engineer, Hector Castillo,
who used a jackhammer to cut through a beam blocking Dy's escape.
   After a couple of hours, Castillo said rescuers bored a 1{-foot
hole and pulled Dy into the passageway to freedom.
   Outside, hundreds of rescuers and spectators cheered as Dy and
the others emerged early Monday.
   ``I am calling for my wife and parents: I'm alive, I'm alive,''
Dy told a radio reporter in Ilocano, the dialect of northern Luzon
island. ``I'm OK.''
   Later, in Manila, Dy told reporters he made a ``secret vow'' to
the Virgin Mary during his days in darkness, although he did not
reveal what it was.
   Dy said he was among 12 people trapped in the basement of the
hotel wing used to house employees. But all the others had died.
   The July 16 earthquake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale.
Besides the 1,653 people killed, 1,000 are missing and presumed
dead, 3,000 were seriously injured and 110,000 were homeless.
   Foreign rescue teams in Baguio abandoned the search for more
survivors more than a week ago because they said sensor instruments
indicated no more people were alive in the ruins of eight hotels.
Baguio is 130 miles north of Manila.
   But Filipino crews, many of them volunteers, continued the
search. There was renewed optimism after two survivors, both hotel
employees, were pulled from the rubble, where they had been trapped
for 11 days.
   The two _ Luisa Mallorca, 20, a cleaning woman and Arnel
Calabia, 26, a guard _ were reported in good condition and were
flown Sunday from Baguio to Manila for medical treatment.
   More than 50 people, including 12 Americans of Filipino origin,
are still believed buried beneath the Hyatt.
   There have been other miraculous cases of earthquake survival in
modern times, but Dy appears to be one of the longest survivors on
record, based on a review of Associated Press reports on other
major recent quakes.
   When a powerful earthquake struck San Francisco on Oct. 21,
1989, rescuers pulled an Oakland longshoreman, Buck Helm, from his
car 89{ hours afterward. He died 28 days after his rescue.
   The most celebrated survivors of a Mexico City earthquake in
September 1985 were the ``miracle babies'' found in the rubble of
two maternity hospitals. The newborns survived periods of
entombment ranging from eight hours to almost nine days.

<TEXT>
   A congressional conference committee approved
a bill Monday that would ban the export of unprocessed logs from
most state-owned lands in the western states.
   Northwest lawmakers drafted the measure this spring to offset a
shrinking timber supply as logging is prohibited on more and more
public lands in an attempt to protect wildlife that inhabit
old-growth forests, including the rare northern spotted owl.
   The proposal now goes to the floors of the House and the Senate,
where approval is expected.
   Under the bill, export of raw logs could continue on one-fourth
of the state-owned lands in Washington, but would be banned on all
state lands in Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming,
Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. Hawaii and Alaska are not
affected.
   Backers of the proposal say it will keep at home about 600
million board feet of timber, three-quarters of it in Washington an
Oregon, annually shipped to more lucrative markets overseas.
   In each of the last two years, about 3.6 billion board feet of
unprocessed timber, the bulk of it from private land, has been
exported from Washington and Oregon, about 80 percent of the total
national exports.
   About one in four trees cut in the Pacific Northwest is shipped
to foreign countries, primarily Japan.
   ``When we are experiencing a tight timber supply, as we are now
in the Northwest, it makes absolutely no sense to be shipping raw
logs overseas,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said.
   Packwood and several other Northwest lawmakers also advocate a
ban on the export of raw logs from private lands, but the Bush
administration as well as the timber industry strongly opposes that
idea.
   The bill would make permanent the temporary ban on raw log
exports from federal lands in the Western United States. It also
would close loopholes in the federal ban that allow some timber
companies to obtain federal logs from a third party for their
domestic mills while shipping their own private logs overseas.

   President Alberto Fujimori declared a two-day
bank holiday Monday to stop a run on the institutions as he
prepares to unveil his economic program aimed at ending the
country's economic crisis.
   Fujimori, sworn in Saturday to a five-year term as president,
said the bank holiday would give his government time ``to implement
the necessary measures to carry out our economic program.''
   The mandatory holiday took effect immediately, and banks were
closed throughout the country on Monday.
   Also Monday, Fujimori, a political newcomer, continued a major
shakeup by firing four of the country's top police officials. The
move follows his dismissal of the heads of the navy and air force
over the weekend.
   The government announced that new chiefs had been appointed to
head the National Police, General Police, Technical Police and
Security Police.
   No specific reasons were given for the police changes. In his
inaugural address, Fujimori pledged a crackdown on official
corruption.
   Fujimori said his government's economic program will be
announced to the country on Thursday or Friday by Prime Minister
and Economy Minister Juan Carlos Hurtado.
   The president has refused to discuss details of the drastic
measures he has promised to try to turn Peru's economy around.
   But he told reporters Monday that the economic measures would
not adversely affect Peruvians' savings.
   ``Quite the contrary,'' he said. ``We want to encourage
Peruvians to save and the measures are aimed at that goal.''
   Fujimori's predecessor, Alan Garcia, left the new president with
an economy that has collapsed.
   Annual inflation tops 3,000 percent. Four of five people lack
steady work and the government is virtually bankrupt.
   Fujimori has said he will cut price subsidies, raise taxes and
privatize many state-owned companies. He has also said he would
devalue Peru's inti to raise the dollar's cost by 300 to 400
percent.
   Last week, many banks ran out of money, leaving thousands of
workers unable to cash their checks. Drivers formed blocks-long
gasoline lines and bread disappeared from poorer neighborhoods.
Store shelves are often half-empty because merchants withhold
supplies in expectation of higher prices.
   Also Monday, Fujimori hosted a luncheon at the presidential
palace for the nation's top military and police officers.
   The luncheon followed his decision last weekend to dismiss the
heads of the navy and the air force.
   On Monday, both branches of the military recognized the new
commanders-in-chief appointed by Fujimori hours after his
inauguration.
   Fujimori dismissed Gen. German Vucetich and Adm. Alfonso Panizo.
He named Gen. Arnaldo Velarde to head the air force and Adm Luis
Montes Lecaros to command the navy.
   Fujimori did not given any reasons for the changes. Panizo and
Vucetich would normally have remained in their posts until the end
of the year.
   The president did not explain the reasons for the changes.
Panizo and Vucetich would have normally remained in their jobs
until the end of this year.
   Vucetich said he does not know why he was dismissed, and
declared he would seek a meeting with Fujimori to get an
explanation.
   Vucetich was forced to retire and Panizo was reassigned to a
position in Washington.
   Analysts said the dismissals were probably part of an effort to
impose authority over the military and in line with Fujimori's
pledge to fight corruption.
   Vucetich had been accused of corruption earlier this year by a
prominent television newsman. The general denied the allegations.
   Panizo probably was fired because he was slow in denying rumors
the military was plotting a coup if Fujimori won June's
presidential election, the analysts said.
   However, Fujimori has given the military a prominent role in his
government. Three ministries _ defense, interior and fisheries _
are headed by military officers.
   Fujimori, 52, is an agronomist of Japanese descent who won a
landslide election victory in his first campaign for office over
acclaimed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.

   A stepfather was convicted Monday of
murdering a toddler he plunged into a toilet as punishment for
soiling his pants.
   The case forced reforms in the way Florida protects children
considered at risk of child abuse.
   It took jurors less than two hours of deliberation to convict
Thomas Coe of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.
   Circuit Judge Randall McDonald ordered the jury to reconvene
Wednesday to decide if Coe should be sentenced to life in prison or
death in the electric chair.
   ``He deserves the electric chair,'' said Pam Kirkland, the
child's foster mother for 14 months. ``For what he did and the way
he did it, I think that would be an appropriate punishment.''
   Coe, 23, testified last week that he ``was out of control'' July
27, 1989, when he dunked his 2-year-old stepson, Bradley McGee,
into the toilet as punishment for soiling his pants. The boy died
the next day of massive injuries.
   ``You have a confession from the man, that was very damaging,''
said prosecutor John Aguero after the verdict.
   Defense attorneys slipped out a back entrance of the courthouse
without answering reporters' questions.
   The state contended that the child's death was a malicious
culmination of weeks of Coe's bizzare abuse.
   But the defense said in closing arguments that the fatal dunking
was an isolated incident in toilet training and that Coe's intent
wasn't malicious. Coe's attorney, Robert Norgard, argued Coe should
be convicted of a lesser offense.
   ``All he meant to do was dunk Bradley's head in the water to use
the association with water to teach the child not to soil his
pants,'' Norgard said. ``In the heat of the moment, he thought of
something that was frankly unusual, but he did not intend to hurt
that child.''
   Prosecutor John Aguero countered: ``There is no rational
explanation for an irrational act. This was a senseless killing.''
   Bradley's death came two months after he was ordered returned
from foster care to his mother, Sheryl McGee Coe, and stepfather,
Thomas Coe.
   Mrs. Coe, 21, has testified that during those two months her
husband often forced the child to pick up feces with his mouth and
ground his fist and cayenne pepper into the boy's genitals.
   She admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating the
toddler with pillows just before he died. She pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a
30-year term.
   Norgard suggested that the jury find Coe guilty of manslaughter,
citing the actual wording of the law as, ``culpable negligence''
rather than an intentional act, and reckless disregard for human
life.
   ``We're not here to ask you to find Coe not guilty _ that man
did cross the line,'' Norgard said. ``But hold this man responsible
for what he did and not for what he didn't do.''
   Medical experts have testified for the prosecution that when
Bradley died, his body was covered with more than 50 bruises, some
of them more than two weeks old.
   Norgard also did his best to discredit the allegations of the
principal state witenss, Sheryl Coe, saying she was trying to
distance herself from the crime to make life easier on herself in
prison.
   Because of news reports about the case, the trial was moved from
Polk County _ where the death occurred _ to Fort Myers.
   Outrage over the case also led to the state's passage of the
``Bradley McGee Act'' which allocated $79 million for more
child-protection workers.
   A former Florida Health and Rehabilitative Services caseworker
was convicted last month of felony child abuse for negligence for
failing to provide a judge with a psychological evaluation of the
Coes describing them as infantile, explosive and unable to handle
children.
   Three other state workers were cleared of charges filed in their
handling of the case.

   The Coast Guard estimated Monday that
500,000 gallons of oil leaked into Galveston Bay from two barges,
10 times its original estimate of the weekend spill that has killed
fish and stalled marine traffic.
   ``We have upgraded the spill to a major spill,'' said Coast
Guard Capt. Thomas Greene.
   A patchy sheen of oil was seen heading through the Bolivar Pass
from the bay into the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to make the
cleanup more difficult, Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene Maestas said
Monday night. The bay is bordered by environmentally sensitive
marshes and beaches.
   A skimmer ship was dispatched to try to keep the oil from the
gulf.
   Thick, black patches of goop and a brown sheen have spread
through much of the bay, Greene said. He said suspicious oil was
reported on at least two beaches south of where the barges and a
tanker collided Saturday.
   The largest slick, estimated at 8 miles long, remained northeast
of the collision site late Monday near Redfish Island in the
Houston Ship Channel, which ``took a pretty bad hit,'' Maestas
said. The Coast Guard didn't have an estimate of how much oil had
washed up on the island.
   The revised estimate came after crews finished removing oil from
a listing barge Monday, and determined how much oil was left in a
second barge partly submerged in the channel, officials said.
   Coast Guard officials estimated 48,000 gallons of oil leaked
from the listing barge, meaning most of the oil leaked from the
nearly sunken vessel. The two barges contained a total of 1.68
million gallons of ``catfeed'' oil, a heavy refinery oil similar to
No. 5 fuel oil, Maestas said.
   Any spill over 100,000 gallons is considered major, Greene said.
The Coast Guard originally estimated 50,000 gallons had spilled.
   The spill has killed an undetermined number of fish near Redfish
Island, and forced the closure of the channel.
   By Monday afternoon, at least 58 ships were stalled at the
Houston docks or outside the Galveston Bay because the channel was
closed. Mark Layton, manager of Kerr Marine Steamship Inc.,
estimated the delays were costing ship owners up to $20,000 per
ship.
   The Coast Guard hopes to reopen the channel by Wednesday, Greene
said.
   The salvage contractor T&amp;T Marine of Galveston used four skimmer
vessels and a vacuum truck to suck up oil on Monday, Greene said.
Booms were used to surround leading edges of the spill to try to
contain the heaviest sections.
   Almost every area surrounding the bay is considered
environmentally sensitive, said Texas Water Commission Chairman
B.J. `Buck'' Wynne.
   ``While the amount of the spill is less than the Mega Borg, I
would say the potential for aquatic damage is more significant,''
he said, referring to last month's spill of 3.9 million gallons
from the Norwegian supertanker some 57 miles offshore from
Galveston.
   Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro agreed, and said a special
session of the Legislature may be necessary to enact oil spill
readiness laws.
   ``I think once again it shows that we in Texas really aren't
prepared to deal with an oil spill,'' he said. ``This happened
Saturday and this is Monday morning, and we're still talking about
what equipment to put where and where we are going to get the
equipment from.''
   Wynne and Mauro plan on Tuesday to present Coast Guard officials
with a plan to use oil-eating microbes on the spill. The state
tried the microbes on the Mega Borg spill and said they'd reduced
the oil in the test area.
   `These tidal wetlands are very sensitive,'' Wynne said. `If oil
gets in there, it might be more difficult to clean up with
conventional methods.'' He said use of skimmers or other mechanical
devices could endanger shallow marshlands and sensitive estuaries.
   The tanker Shinoussa was damaged in the collision with two of
three barges under tow by the tanker Chandy N, but did not leak any
of the 24,900 metric tons of jet fuel it was carrying.
   Coast Guard officials originally believed the tanker was of
Liberian registry, but learned Monday that the 610-foot,
double-hulled vessel is a Greek ship.

   An infant boy was killed by a stray bullet
Monday, just hours after mourners packed the funeral of a
9-year-old girl shot to death less than a week before.
   The 9-month-old baby, Rayvon Jamison, was shot after someone
pumped seven bullets through the door of the child's Bronx
apartment at 4:11 p.m., said Officer Fred Weiner, a police
spokesman.
   His death brings to four the number of children killed in New
York in a week by bullets apparently intended for others.
   He was sitting in a walker when he was struck twice by gunfire,
Weiner said. The child's mother, uncle and grandmother were in the
room at the time of the shooting, he added.
   Rayvon died a short time later at Lincoln Hospital.
   Police were investigating a possible dispute between the uncle
and another man as a motive in the shooting, but had made no
arrests.
   Mayor David Dinkins said the killing demonstrated the need for a
complete federal ban on assault weapons.
   ``Do we need further proof of what happens when we allow so many
people to be armed with so many guns firing so many bullets?''
Dinkins said. ``Our children are dying.''
   Yaritimi Fruto, 1, was killed last week in Brookly by gunmen who
also killed her father. Ben Williams, 3, was killed last week when
someone fired 18 shots through the door of his grandmother's
Brooklyn apartment while he slept on a fold-out couch.
   There have been no arrests in those shootings.
   Earlier in the day, about 250 people listened as pastor
Wengeslao Martinez of the Rock of Salvation Pentecostal Church in
Brooklyn, and his son, Samuel, recalled VeronicaCorales' enthusiasm.
   Samuel Martinez described Corales, as ``beautiful, sincere,
truthful, happy, cheerful and full of joy.''
   ``This is all the things she expressed and made us express back
to her,'' he said. ``Her love and joy is within our hearts.''
   Shortly after her funeral, an indictment charging Dorian
Daughtry with second-degree murder in her death. Daughtry, 22, is a
former minor-league baseball player.
   The girl was struck by a stray bullet July 22 as she slept in a
parked car in Brooklyn's East New York section. Her family had just
returned from a New Jersey amusement park and was dropping off
relatives.
   Police said Daughtry apparently was involved in a shootout with
at least one other person and the girl was struck with a bullet
from Daughtry's gun, which was not recovered.
   Daughtry joined the Seattle Mariners' Class A farm team, the
Bellingham, Wash., Mariners, in 1987. He played outfield and roomed
with Ken Griffey Jr., now a major league all star. Daughtry asked
to be released after the 1989 season.

   The House approved legislation Monday
establishing a commemorative medal for members of the U.S. armed
forces who were present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
Dec. 7, 1941.
   By voice vote, the House directed the Treasury Department to
strike a bronze medal that would be presented to those veterans as
nearly as possible to the 50th anniversary of the attack.
   The medal could be accepted by families of those killed on that
fateful day or veterans who survived the attack and died later. The
bill applies to those who defended Pearl Harbor and other military
installations in Hawaii.
   The bill also directs the Treasury to duplicate smaller versions
of the medal in bronze that can be sold.
   The suprise Japanese attack by 360 planes from six aircraft
carriers sank seven of eight battleships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
The United States entered World War II the following day with a
declaration of war against Japan.
   Military casualties were listed as 2,343 killed, 960 missing and
1,272 wounded. In addition, 49 civilians were killed and 83 wounded.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and the chief negotiator for Moslem extremists said Monday
they have reached agreement to end a 4-day-old hostage siege.
   Robinson is one of 41 hostages reported held since Friday by
black Moslem extremists led by Abu Bakr.
   Justice and National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson,
speakig from inside Parliament where the uprising began, said the
agreement called for Robinson's immediate resignation with
elections to be held within 90 days.
   Richardson said the government had granted amnesty to the Moslem
radicals involved in the insurgency, which has left at least nine
people dead, according to officials.
   Speaking by telephone from inside Parliament, Robinson said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. Joe Theodore, head of
the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator Bilal Abdullah, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister Robinson has just said.''
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams reported earlier Monday that
the Moslems were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and
grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, Williams said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since Friday. He said Anglican
negotiator Knolly Clarke told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   Trinidad is just off northeast Venezuela, and is a former
British colony that gained independence in 1962. It has been
wracked in recent years by declining oil revenues and economic
doldrums, including high unemployment.

   Fourteen research monkeys suffered
heatstroke and died after being left outside as temperatures soared
into the 90's, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Monday.
   The rhesus monkeys, which had been taken from their cages for
deworming and health screening, were discovered on the floor of an
outdoor housing building at the agency's breeding and holding
complex in Lawrenceville.
   The monkeys died July 9, but Monday was the first public
announcement of the deaths by the CDC.
   CDC officials said it was the biggest number of accidental
primate deaths in the half-decade history of the research agency.
The monkeys were among a colony of 100 raised for research in the
CDC's breeding complex.
   Researchers said heat usually doesn't cause abnormal stress for
rhesus monkeys, which are commonly found in the subtropical regions
of India and Asia, as well as in the frigid Himalayas of Nepal.
   ``Everyone concerned with it is very upset that it happened, and
we are taking steps to see that it doesn't happened again,'' said
Bobby G. Brown, chief of the CDC's animal resources branch.
   Brown said the monkeys, among 33 which had been taken from one
section of the rhesus compound, had been anesthetized to allow six
animal handlers to safely deworm them and test them for the simian
AIDS virus and tuberculosis.
   The other monkeys suffered no ill effects from the treatment.
   The CDC is investigating the deaths.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first test of a new extradition
law in the Republic of Ireland, a man wanted in an IRA bombing
campaign lost an appeal Monday against being extradited to England.
   The High Court denied an appeal by television engineer Desmond
Ellis, 37, whose lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   Ellis is named in two warrants alleging possession of explosives
with intent to endanger life and conspiracy to cause explosions in
Britain between Jan. 1, 1981, and Oct. 27, 1983.
   Scotland Yard Detective Sgt. Ian Macleod testified that 13
fingerprints linked Ellis to an Irish Republican Army arms cache
found in October 1983, and five bomb attacks in London in 1981.
   Laywers for Ellis argued that the alleged offenses were
political, and ``an integral and necessary part of the campaign by
the IRA to end British rule in Northern Ireland.''
   Justice Liam Hamilton held that the alleged offenses involved
``indiscriminate violence and can correctly be characterized as
terrorism.''
   Ellis swore in an affidavit that he was in Irish or U.S. jails
during the bombings.
   The District Court ordered Ellis' extradition last January. He
has been in custody since then, awaiting appeal. He will remain in
custody until his appeal before the Supreme Court.
   The case is the first to be heard under a 1987 Republic of
Ireland Act which curtails the plea of political motivation.
   The IRA is seeking to overthrow the institutions governing the
Irish Republic, as well as end British rule in Northern Ireland.

   Swiss authorities froze several bank
accounts last week believed to contain millions of dollars linked
to savings-and-loan fraud in the United States, Justice Ministry
spokeswoman Ursula Riedel said Monday.
   She said the accounts were frozen in at least three Geneva banks
pending a Swiss decision on a U.S. request for judicial aid in the
case of now-defunct Community Savings and Loan in Bethesda, Md.
   She said U.S. government investigators asked in mid-July for
access to bank records they think can shed light on the scandal.
   Swiss federal authorities can approve transmission of the
request to Geneva officials, who will make a final decision on the
U.S. request.
   The U.S. request did not say how much money allegedly is in the
accounts, Ms. Riedel told The Associated Press.
   Published reports said President Tom J. Billmann of Community
Savings and Loan was alleged to have defrauded clients of $106
million.
   Swiss accounts reportedly hold $22 million of the total.
   Authorities closed the Bethesda bank after the case broke.
Billmann, 50, is living in the Costa del Sol resort area of Spain
and is being sought by police, the Washington Post reported.

<TEXT>
   George Steinbrenner was stripped Monday of
direct control of the New York Yankees, all but ending a turbulent
18-year reign during which he alienated players and fans alike.
   Fans at Yankee Stadium for a game against the Detroit Tigers
greeted the announcement with a 90-second standing ovation.
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent forced Steinbrenner to resign
as principal partner of the team for paying a gambler to dig up
dirt on Dave Winfield, the American League team's onetime star
outfielder.
   Steinbrenner agreed to Vincent's terms following a four-month
investigation by the commissioner into Steinbrenner's dealing with
self-described gambler Howard Spira. Observers suggested that
Steinbrenner was seeking leverage to force Winfield to accept a
trade to another team, something his contract gave him a right to
refuse.
   ``Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the
management of the New York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations
of that club,'' Vincent said.
   Steinbrenner, the team's majority owner, must resign as general
partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be appointed to take his
place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other major
league teams. Vincent asked Steinbrenner to reduce his interest to
below 50 percent within the next six months.
   Steinbrenner will, however, be allowed to consult on major
business decisions involving the Yankees, but he must ask Vincent's
permission to attend games.
   ``For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be
treated as if he had been placed on the permanent ineligible
list,'' Vincent said.
   Steinbrenner also agreed he wouldn't contest the decision in
court.
   ``I will not comment on the decision,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm
very happy it was resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution,
and that's all I'm going to say.''
   This was the second straight summer baseball penalized one of
its more famous characters. Last August, Pete Rose was banned for
life for gambling.
   As one baseball's more fiery characters, Steinbrenner was famous
for his hiring and firing of managers, particularly the late Billy
Martin, and for feuding with his players, including Reggie Jackson
and Winfield.
   Winfield was one of Steinbrenner's many high-priced free agents,
but Steinbrenner turned on the star outfielder after he went
1-for-22 in the 1981 World Series loss to Los Angeles. Later,
Steinbrenner derided Winfield as ``Mr. May,''' saying he only came
through when it didn't count.
   Winfield and Steinbrenner feuded throughout the 1980s and, after
several years of trying, Winfield was finally traded to the
California Angels last May.
   Steinbrenner is the only owner to be severely penalized twice
for major offenses. He was suspended in 1974 by then-Commissioner
Bowie Kuhn for making illegal campaign contributions to Richard
Nixon.
   This time, Vincent disciplined Steinbrenner for violating Rule
21, otherwise knows as the ``best interests of baseball'' clause.
   ``I am able to evaluate a pattern of behavior that borders on
the bizarre,'' Vincent said. ``It is apparent to me that Mr.
Steinbrenner does not appreciate the gravity of his conduct.''
   The investigation centered on Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to
Spira, a 31-year-old New Yorker who describes himself as a former
gambler and a former employee of the David M. Winfield Foundation.
   Steinbrenner testified before Vincent on July 5 and July 6 and
gave various reasons for the payment to Spira. Among them were that
he was afraid Spira would attack his family, that he gave Spira the
money ``out of the goodness of my heart'' and that he wanted to
protect two former Yankees employees from embarassing revelations.
   Many fans at Yankee Stadium thought Steinbrenner got what he
deserved.
   ``That's what should happen to any owner that constantly makes
decisions to hurt the club,'' said Trevor Beckford of Westbury,
N.Y. ``He traded away my favorite player, Dave Winfield, and
changed managers it seemed like every month.''

   A plum-sized emerald valued at millions of
dollars remained unsold Monday night after its owner called the
highest bid of $850,000 unacceptable and removed it from an auction.
   Touted as the world's finest, the 83.1-carat gem went on the
auction block at the Ritz-Carlton Houston. But the stone was
removed from the auction ``with reserve'' after the highest bid
received fell short of hopes.
   ``That was not acceptable,'' said Rob Plumer, a representative
of the owner, whose name was kept secret.
   Nicknamed ``Denise'' after the fiancee of the Los Angeles owner,
the emerald was the main attraction of a sale that featured
hundreds of other gemstones and Soviet artwork.
   The sale, estimated to bring $10 million, began Sunday and
continued Monday evening.
   Plumer said the owner would consider whether to offer it for
sale later. ``We had mixed feelings about selling it anyway. We
really don't know now,'' he said.
   He said the gem was valued at more than $3 million. He said the
minimum acceptable bid for the gem would have been $1.5 million.
   The emerald was retrieved from the famous Muzo mine in Colombia,
considered the finest emerald mine in the world, said Sandy Reid,
executive vice president of Greystone Galleries of Toronto.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug czar William J. Bennett on Monday
proposed taking children away from drug-ridden families and
neighborhoods, and putting them in foster homes and other
institutions.
   ``It may be radical, but radical circumstances require radical
means,'' Bennett said during a luncheon on the opening day of the
National Urban League's 80th anniversary convention.
   Bennett told those attending the civil rights group's meeting
that with the big-city narcotics crisis likely to get worse before
it gets better, anti-drug efforts must focus on the young.
   ``The heart of any plan must be a plan to save our children,''
said the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
``If we don't tend to these children soon, no government or
non-government program will fill the need.''
   Bennett proposed that the courts be permitted to remove children
from families were parents or guardians are addicted or too
preoccupied with drugs to provide physical, moral or spiritual
guidance.
   The courts would place the children in foster homes, such
institutions as Boy's Towns or Girl's Towns and school- and
church-sponsored centers, Bennett said.
   He noted that courts can now take such steps for abused or
negelected minors, but said his proposal was likely to provoke
controversy.
   ``If this shocks some people into getting guardians to guarding,
and parents to parenting, then fine,'' Bennett said.
   He appealed to the Urban League for support, citing a statement
by group President John E. Jacob that ``drugs are destroying more
children and more families than poverty ever did.''
   Bennett provided few specifics on his proposal. He told a news
conference following the luncheon that he wanted ``to see if we can
get some agreement on the principle.''
   Jacob said in a telephone interview that he found ``unnerving''
any proposal that would take children away from their parents and
``this one is no less unnerving.''
   But he said the children's safety should be the uppermost
concern. ``The challenge is that if you don't like our plan, come
up with a better one to strengthen families and help children stay
in families,'' Jacob said.
   Bennett said he'd been criticized recently for remarking that
orphanages might help solve the problem of children whose families
had disintegrated from drugs.
   ``Some people thought that was too Dickensian a phrase, but the
reality is a lot worse than anything Charles Dickens ever
imagined,'' Bennett said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders FBI to Make Index of Documents on Hoffa Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered the Justice Department
to index FBI documents on its investigation of Jimmy Hoffa's
disappearance 15 years ago Monday, a ruling the former Teamsters
leader's family hailed as a victory.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh ordered the government to
prepare within 30 days an itemized list off all documents related
to a freedom of information request by the family.
   The government must provide a detailed justification for any
documents it wants exempted, Limbaugh ruled.
   ``Our family is extremely grateful. Fifteen years have gone by
without them telling us what they know,'' said attorney Barbara
Crancer, who sued the government for files on her father's case in
February 1989.
   ``We've waited so long to hear something,'' she said.
   Crancer said it was ``pretty ironic'' the ruling Friday came
just before the 15th anniversary of Hoffa's July 30, 1975,
disappearance.
   ``I don't think the judge planned it that way,'' she said.
   Calls seeking comment from FBI spokesman John Anthony and
Justice Department attorney Henry Fredericks were not immediately
returned.
   Hoffa, 62, vanished from a restaurant parking lot in the Detroit
suburb of Bloomfield Township. Federal investigators have said they
believe he was murdered but couldn't release their files because
their probe was continuing.
   Hoffa built Detroit's Local 299, a tiny Teamsters unit, into a
15,000-member local, and became president of the international
union.
   In 1958, he was hauled before the U.S. Senate rackets committee
and accused of running a ``hoodlum empire.''
   Nine years later, Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and
fraud involving the Teamsters Central Pension Fund and received a
five-year federal prison term. Under a sentence commutation he
received from President Nixon in 1971, Hoffa was barred from
returning to office in the Teamsters until 1980.
   When Hoffa vanished, he was contesting that provision in court.
His son, Detroit attorney Jimmy P. Hoffa has said he thinks his
father was killed because he was trying to return to union power.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. reported a 64.8 percent drop
in second-quarter earnings, while Times Mirror Co. said its
after-tax profit tumbled 44.7 percent. Both said the big drops
resulted from comparisons to year-earlier profits that were
inflated by one-time gains from the sale of assets.
   In other earnings reports, Tribune Co. said its net profit fell
25 percent, and Washington Post Co. said its earnings decreased 7.5
percent.
   All the companies said their operations were affected by the
weakness in the advertising climate.

   Times Mirror said it earned $47.0 million in the April-June
quarter, compared with $85.0 million in 1989. Revenue rose 5.3
percent to $906.6 million from $861.3 million.
   The company said 17 percent of the year-earlier profit came from
the sale of timberlands.
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive, said weak
economic conditions continued to adversely affect the company's
newspaper and other advertising-driven businesses.
   For the first six months, the company earned $93.0 million, down
39.5 percent from $153.8 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 4
percent to $1.78 billion from $1.71 billion.

<TEXT>
   Tribune earned $58.1 million in the quarter, compared with $75.3
million a year ago. Revenue rose 2 percent to $656.2 million from
$643.1 million.
   The company said its operating profit from newspaper publishing
fell 33 percent, mainly due to losses at the Daily News in New
York. Profit at the Chicago Tribune improved, but results at its
other papers were flat or lower because of softness in retail and
classified advertising.
   Operating profit for the newsprint group fell 83 percent because
of lower newsprint selling prices and the adverse impact of a
stronger Canadian dollar.
   For the first six months, Tribune earned $89.6 million, down 20
percent from $112.1 million in 1989. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to
$1.24 billion from $1.2 billion.

   Knight-Ridder earned $44.6 million in the quarter, compared with
$126.8 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $591.7
million from $578.7 million.
   The company noted that two-thirds of the 1989 profit resulted
from the sale of the Star News in Pasadena, Calif., and television
operations. Net income from continuing operations in the latest
quarter was up 14.3 percent from a year ago, it said.
   Knight-Ridder said advertising revenue at its 31 newspapers was
under pressure, with retail and general advertising revenue
marginally higher and classified ad revenue down slightly.
   For the first six months, Knight-Ridder earned $70.5 million,
down 52 percent from $147.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose
2.7 percent to $1.15 billion from $1.12 billion.

   Washington Post earned $55.9 million for the quarter, compared
with $60.5 million a year ago. Revenue edged up 1 percent to $379.6
million from $374.5 million.
   The company said revenue at its newspaper division dipped 2
percent as ad volume fell 9 percent at The Washington Post. Revenue
at Newsweek was up 6 percent because the latest quarter had one
more issue than the year-ago period.
   Revenue was down 4 percent for the broadcast division and up 11
percent in the cable division.
   For the first six months, Washington Post earned $95.0 million,
down 6.9 percent from $102 million in 1989. Revenue edged up 0.5
percent to $720.5 million from $716.3 million.

<HEAD>Reuters Says Earnings Up 27 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters Holdings PLC said July 24 that its
after-tax profit jumped 27 percent in the first half of the year,
helped by strong sales in all major markets, particularly Europe.
   Reuters said earnings for the January-June period were the
equivalent of $188 million, compared with $148 million in 1989.
Revenue rose 26 percent to $1.2 billion from $954 million.
   The company said sales strength was partly due to the relative
weakness of the pound during the period, which made British
companies more competitive in selling products and services in
other countries. The pound has since rebounded.
   Reuters said that ``conditions in financial markets remain
difficult and cancellations of Reuter services, which were already
high, have recently risen further.''
   The company did not report separately for the second quarter,
which is not required under British law.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. lost $51 million in the second
quarter because of costs and interest expenses related to Time's
$14 billion purchase of Warner Communications Inc.
   But the company said July 23 that earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization climbed to a record $536
million for the quarter.
   It said four of its six business segments _ films, records,
cable TV systems and programming _ had record second quarters.
Earnings were down in the magazine division because of the soft
advertising climate and startup costs of Entertainment Weekly, and
profits also were down in the book division.
   Time bought controlling interest in Warner last July but did not
complete its purchase of the rest of Warner's stock until January.
   Compiling results as if both companies had been combined both
years, the latest loss compared with a loss of $52 million in
1989's second quarter. Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $2.59 billion
from $2.48 billion.
   For the first six months, Time Warner lost $102 million,
compared with a loss of $133 million a year ago. Revenue rose 6
percent to $5.33 billion from $5.03 billion.

<HEAD>Washington Times' Loss Reported at $35 Million a Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Times has been losing $35
million a year and the deficit is being covered by the Unification
Church, The Washington Post reported July 27.
   The Post quoted Bo Hi Pak, a deputy to the church's founder, the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon, from an interview in Seoul, South Korea.
   Pak said the church and its subsidiaries are ``very glad to
subsidize'' the Times because it contributes to world peace. The
newspaper will not be sold or closed, he said.
   He estimated losses at $250 million since the newspaper started
publishing eight years ago.
   The Times and the Post are the only two daily newspapers in
Washington. The Times, which publishes Monday through Friday,
reported circulation of 106,852 in September. The Post, which
publishes seven days a week, reported Monday through Saturday
circulation of 731,407 and Sunday circulation of 1,126,123.
   Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-chief of the Times, said the
newspaper is not subsidized directly by the Unification Church.
   ``We are subsidized by various businesses run by members of the
church,'' de Borchgrave said. ``I run a secular newspaper. It has
no connection with the church. We have never received an editorial
instruction from the church or from Dr. Pak since I took over in
March 1985.''
   Pak is president of the parent company of the newspaper.
   In the interview, he said the church hopes to expand its video
operations into a nationwide cable system, and to establish
businesses and recruit church members in China and the Soviet Union.
   Businesses operated by church members include a machine tool
company in Germany, a fishing fleet in Alaska, a computer lab in
Japan, a video production company near Washington and a controlling
interest in a nationwide cable channel.
   Pak said church headquarters in Seoul receives revenue of $100
million a year in business profits and church dues from members. He
did not provide a breakdown.

<HEAD>Second-Quarter Profit Up Slightly at Capital Cities-ABC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losses on ESPN's first months of major league
baseball coverage held earnings growth at Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
to a slim 1.6 percent in the second quarter, the company said July
24.
   Capital Cities warned its third-quarter earnings could be below
last year's level if weak advertising demand persists at its TV
station, radio and publishing operations and additional losses
result as anticipated for ESPN's baseball coverage. Capital Cities
owns 80 percent of the cable network.
   The owner of the ABC Television Network said it earned $142.3
million, or $8.19 a share, in the three months ended July 1
compared with $140.2 million, or $7.83 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 11 percent to $1.36 billion from
$1.23 billion a year earlier.
   Operating income was up 2 percent to $270.3 million, reflecting
significant improvement at the ABC TV network, a 10 percent gain
from the publishing group, a moderate rise at its TV stations and a
slight decline in radio operations.
   But video operations results fell sharply as a result of a $20
million loss incurred in the quarter at ESPN, which this spring
began its first year of covering major league baseball.
   Last year, ESPN won a four-year, $400 million contract to cover
up to 175 baseball games a year. But the audiences have been
smaller than expected, forcing the cable network to give
advertisers extra commercial time for free.

representing lobbyist Robert J. Thompson, who was an aide to George
Bush when he was vice president.
   Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business
rights, which is looking into Thompson's involvement in negotiating
the bailout of 15 thrift institutions now combined as Bluebonnet
Savings Bank of Dallas.
   The Times ran a front-page story by reporter Jeff Gerth on
questions surrounding the Bluebonnet deal July 8, the day before
Metzenbaum's subcommittee held a hearing on the case.
   ``It now appears indisputable that sensitive investigative
information ... gathered in the name of the U.S. Senate, was
deliberately, intentionally and inappropriately given to a major
national newspaper,'' Brand wrote.
   Brand based his complaint, in part, on a statement from Cable
News Network reporter Brooks Jackson, who said he was told by
Metzenbaum's staff that they had made an exclusive arrangement to
share information with Gerth in exchange for an agreement that the
Times would hold the story until the day before the hearing.
   Jackson, who was quoted in the July 21 editions of The
Washington Post, said he was quoted accurately but declined to
reveal which Metzenbaum aide had told him about the arrangement
with the Times.
   Gerth referred inquiries to Howell Raines, the newspaper's
Washington bureau chief, who said, ``As a matter of policy, we
don't discuss sources or the editorial process.'' He said the story
was ``meticulously researched from a number of sources'' and ``was
industriously and honorably reported.''
   Nancy Coffey, Metzenbaum's press secretary, said Brand's
complaint was too ridiculous to comment on.
   Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics committee, said he
could not discuss what action the panel was taking on the complaint
or even whether it had been received. He said complaints typically
are referred to staff attorneys, who can then recommend whether or
not the complaint should be investigated.

   Some advertisers canceled television
commercials that were to run during the Professional Golfers'
Association championship Aug. 9-12 after a controversy over the
host club's all-white status.
   ``Supporting even indirectly activities which are exclusionary
is against IBM's practices and policies,'' Gina Chew-Holman, an IBM
spokeswoman, said July 24.
   Toyota and Anheuser-Busch joined IBM in withdrawing support for
the telecast.
   Club founder Hall Thompson earlier had said the private club,
Shoal Creek, would not be pressured into accepting black members.
He later apologized and said he was quoted out of context. Shoal
Creek officials have said the club does not have a policy against
blacks and that some blacks have been guests.
   The Associated Press Sports Editors, an organization of sports
editors of AP member newspapers, sent a letter to PGA officials
July 2 protesting Thompson's remarks and called on major golf
organizations to examine the membership policies of country clubs
before awarding championship events.

<HEAD>Council on Aging Worker Fired for Tipping Press to Feature Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A food server who urged a newspaper to
profile a 115-year-old man was fired from her job at the Council on
Aging because she was not authorized to contact the media,
officials said.
   Betty Scanlan, 60, earned $3.80 an hour serving lunch to about
10 senior citizens. She also set aside lunches for sailors who
delivered food to elderly patrons of the council's Meals on Wheels
program.
   Scanlan called the Pensacola News Journal after a sailor said he
delivered meals to a man who claimed to be 115.
   A reporter said she would investigate the claim and also wanted
to write about Navy volunteers from Corry Station Technical
Training Center.
   ``I thought it would be great for the sailors to get a little
recognition ... I didn't think it'd be such a disaster,'' Scanlan
said July 25.
   On July 18, Scanlan accompanied the reporter to a church where
sailors were picking up meals.
   Later that day, Scanlan was fired because personnel policy
stipulates that only the council's chairman, executive director and
project directors ``may officially represent the agency in making
public announcements, speeches and comments about agency
business,'' council officials said.
   The newspaper has yet to run the stories.

<HEAD>Daily News Rips Cuomo Over Labor Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News blasted Gov. Mario Cuomo in an
editorial July 29 for creating a ``completely unjustified'' board
of inquiry to examine labor negotiations at the newspaper.
   ``The News feels free to call the governor's action ... a
cynical political move by a potential presidential candidate to
curry favor with national labor leaders,'' the editorial said.
   The News and its 10 unions have been negotiating for months
without success to replace contracts that expired March 30.
   State Labor Commissioner Thomas Hartnett announced July 26 he
was appointing a fact-finding panel to provide ``a fresh look at
the issues'' and help prevent the dispute from harming the regional
economy.
   The panel has no legal authority to compel actions by either
side, although it has broad power to subpoena witnesses and gather
evidence.
   The editorial called the panel a ``completely unjustified
intrusion into the collective bargaining process and a violation of
federal labor law.''
   It also ripped the board as ``a publicity stunt that could have
a ruinous impact on the state's business climate.''
   Cuomo called the editorial ``a ploy by a management that is
desperately seeking to avoid an objective look at the issues.'' He
said the state has ``the legal right, and the practical obligation,
to help achieve fairness by disclosing the truth.''

<HEAD>Magazines' Difficulties Reflect Industry, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Woman magazine is being closed and Woman's Day
no longer is for sale, two developments reflecting difficult times
in the magazine business.
   Conde Nast Publications Inc. said July 25 it would close Woman
magazine after its September issue. It is the first Conde Nast
magazine to cease publication since the Newhouse family took over
the company in 1959. Woman has been published for 10 years but was
acquired by Conde Nast about 18 months ago.
   Separately, France's Hachette SA said it shelved plans to sell
Woman's Day magazine, saying it was dissatisfied with the bids it
received over the past two months and now will invest in improving
it.
   Both Woman's Day and Woman have had double-digit declines in
advertising pages for the year's first six months amid an
industry-wide ad slump.
   Consumer magazine ad pages were off 3.3 percent across the
industry in the year's first half compared with the January-to-June
period in 1989, with traditionally heavy magazine advertisers such
as automotive and tobacco companies making major cutbacks in
spending.
   Magazine industry analyst Martin S. Walker said the two latest
developments show ``the market has really decided that there is no
long-term future in broadly based women service magaines.''

<HEAD>Reporter Misidentified as Killer</HEAD>

   A reporter covering a murder trial was ejected
from the courtroom July 24 after a witness misidentified her as the
killer.
   The witness changed her mind after a closer look, but reporter
Marlys Duran of the Rocky Mountain News was ordered to leave the
room and told she might be called as a defense witness.
   Mildred Goble was a witness in the first-degree murder trial of
Christina Acker, who was accused of killing Margaret Hamilton in
1989.
   Asked if Acker was in the courtroom, Goble pointed to the
reporter.
   ``I was seated in the first row of the spectators' section
behind the defendant,'' Duran said. ``I was just dumbfounded.''
   The reporter said she and Acker have the same hairstyle, but the
suspect's hair is a different color, ``and she's probably 6 inches
shorter than me.''
   Defense attorney Harvey Steinberg said prosecutors were still
relying heavily on Goble's testimony.
   ``It's kind of strange they'd take that position after she
identifies Marlys Duran as the last person to be seen alive with
the victim.''

   Mayor Mel Hughes lifted his edict prohibiting Enrica Stuart,

   Despite reversing himself, the mayor remained unapologetic.

   Peter Citron, a former entertainment reporter
and columnist, was sentenced to three to eight years in prison and
was diagnosed as a mentally disordered sex offender requiring
treatment.
   In passing sentence July 23, District Judge Merritt C. Warren
described Citron as a pedophile since at least 1965.
   ``You are a sick man, and you need treatment for a long time,''
Warren said.
   Citron, 50, pleaded no contest in May to two counts of sexual
assault of a child. He was a columnist for the Omaha World-Herald
at the time of his arrest in February and resigned shortly after
his arrest.
   Citron was charged after two boys, then ages 13 and 11, told
police Citron had fondled them through their clothing in separate
incidents at his home. Police officers seized several boxes of
evidence from Citron's home.
   Before the sentence was read, Citron told the judge that he was
``dreadfully sorry'' for any harm he had done and asked for
probation instead of a prison sentence.
   Psychiatric reports ordered by Warren concluded that Citron is a
treatable mentally disordered sex offender. As a result, Citron
could serve at least part of his sentence at the Lincoln Regional
Center, a state mental hospital.

   Police confiscated the camera and film
of a newspaper photographer taking pictures at the scene of a fatal
shooting July 24.
   The camera was returned shortly thereafter and the undeveloped
film was returned about seven hours later, after a telephone
conference between police and newspaper attorneys.
   Police said Albuquerque Journal photographer Jeff McClintic
crossed the lines of a crime investigation. McClintic denied it and
Journal Editor Gerald Crawford said authorities were high-handed in
seizing the camera and film.
   Versions of the incident differed, with police and the district
attorney's office both saying the other had ordered the
confiscation.
   Assistant District Attorney Mark Burtner, who was on the scene,
said the film was taken because an unidentified person was taking
pictures in the middle of a crime scene. Police ordered the
confiscation, he said.
   Police supervisor Capt. Cliff Jenkins said police were concerned
that pictures of the unidentified body might be printed before next

   A hair salon is suing the television show ``A
Current Affair,'' saying the show falsely portrayed it as a den of
devil worship and promiscuous teen-agers.
   The suit was filed July 23 by Super Hair Associates Three-13 in
Marietta, Ga. It seeks at least $40,000 damages.
   One of the salon's employees was Jan Parsons, who, according to
a suit by her mother, was featured nude in a home video made by
movie star Rob Lowe.
   A spokesman for the television show, Jeff Erdel, said the suit
has no merit.
   The suit contends the narrator of the segment titled ``It's the
Shame of Atlanta'' heralded the segment as a ``special look inside
the bizarre Atlanta club scene.''
   ``Jan was not new to the fast lane,'' the narrator continued.
``Locals say the hair salon where she worked is a magnet for
rebellious teen-agers, kids who sleep around, do drugs and spend
all night in the clubs. It's the shame of Atlanta. ... Some say the
hair dressers at Super Hair worship the devil, some insist it's a

<HEAD>British Court Issues Temporary Book Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A High Court judge on July 27 issued a temporary
injunction banning a book that reportedly gives intimate details
about Britain's royal family.
   Justice Michael Wright banned author Malcolm Barker from
publishing ``Courting Disaster'' anywhere in the world, but stayed
the ban until July 30, pending an appeal.
   The injunction also forbids Barker's Nova Scotia-based
publisher, Fleetwood Publications, from selling the book in
Britain. The book is on sale in Canada, the United States and
Bermuda, said Barker's lawyer, David Fowell.
   Lawyers for Barker and Fleetwood Publications said they would
appeal against the part of the court order that bans Barker from
publishing outside Britain.
   Barker worked from 1980 to 1983 as a storeman-clerk to the
Master of the Royal Household at Buckingham Palace.
   The book makes disclosures that lawyers for Queen Elizabeth II
claim breach a confidentiality agreement signed by Barker when he
joined the palace staff. If Barker, who lives in Nova Scotia but is
currently visiting Britain, disobeys the order he could be jailed
and face heavy fines for contempt of court.
   Angered by behind-the-scenes revelations by former employees,
the palace in recent years has increasingly reverted to legal
action to suppress a succession of spicy memoirs.

<HEAD>Private Eye and Editor Fined for Contempt</HEAD>

   An appeals court fined the magazine Private Eye
and its editor $18,100 each July 26 for publishing articles that
prosecutors said could have affected the outcome of the notorious
Yorkshire Ripper murder case.
   They also alleged the articles were intended to discourage the
defendant's wife from pursuing a libel case against the satirical
magazine.
   Outside court, Private Eye Editor Ian Hislop said: ``I'm
disappointed. We will pay the fines and it's a slap on the wrist.''
   The Court of Appeal panel upheld the Attorney General's appeal
against a High Court ruling that favored the magazine in March.
   The High Court found that two February 1989 articles did not
pose a threat to the administration of justice in the trial of
Peter Sutcliffe, who became known as the Yorkshire Ripper. Those
articles claimed the defendant's wife, Sonia Sutcliffe, had
provided her husband with a false alibi and defrauded the
Department of Health and Social Services.
   Sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women and
attempting to kill another five. Mrs. Sutcliffe was not implicated
in any of the crimes.

   Chief Soviet censor Vladimir Boldyrev said the Glavlit
censorship agency will continue to check foreign publications, and
audio and visual materials mailed to the Soviet Union for calls to
overthrow the government or to commit crimes, and for pornography,
war propaganda, and material promoting racial or ethnic superiority.
   The press law, debated for months before it was passed by the
Soviet legislature on June 12, takes effect Aug. 1. It also gives
any Soviet citizen the right to establish a media outlet.
   The law forbids publication of state secrets, but the penalties
are to be imposed on whoever leaks them rather than on the
journalist reporting them.
   It also forbids slander and abuses of privacy.
   Scores of unofficial papers have appeared in the Soviet Union.
Their publishers must scramble to reach agreements with state-run
printing houses to supply paper.

   The government said banning The Asian Wall
Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review from covering
the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference would not keep other Asians
from getting news about the meeting.
   Goh Chok Tong, first deputy prime minister and defense minister,
said more than 100 correspondents from foreign news agencies,
newspapers and magazines had received permission to attend the
conference July 30-31.
   He made the comment July 23 in a written reply to a letter from
Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. of New York, owner of the Hong Kong-based
publications, which are widely circulated in Asia.
   In a letter to Goh, Dow Jones vice president Karen Elliot House
had questioned the ban, saying the government previously had
asserted a right to control coverage of Singapore's internal
affairs that might be read by residents of the island state.
   Since the conference is a meeting on international issues, House
wrote, ``it appears that the government of Singapore is now
asserting its right to control what other Asians are permitted to
read about major international meetings that happen to occur in
your country.''
   Singapore has accused the Journal and weekly Economic Review of
interfering in its domestic politics, a charge the two publications
deny. The government has refused to let the Review base a reporter
here since mid-1987 and the Journal since mid-1988.
   In 1987, the government required the Journal to reduce its daily
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5,000. The Review was
ordered to cut back to 400-500 copies a week from 10,000 but the
magazine refused to continue selling in Singapore.

   About 1,400 callers to a 900-code number paid 75 cents to choose
their favorite story from six choices. The four other reports dealt
with Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug trial, a sailing program
designed to keep Indian teen-agers off drugs, summer jobs, and
efforts to save the spotted owl.
   ``This was the shakedown cruise,'' executive producer Joshua

<HEAD>FCC Head Says Cities Should Allow Cable Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal officials too often slam the door on
companies that could provide head-to-head competition for cable TV
operators, a federal regulator said July 27.
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes rejected
the notion that, like utility monopolies, communities are best
served by exclusive cable TV franchises. He said competition will
drive down both costs and prices.
   A new FCC study shows that cable operators face head-to-head
competition in only a handful of communities, resulting in high
prices and poor service, Sikes told a news conference.
   ``Head-to-head competition places an exceptionally high premium
on cutting costs and putting the customer first,'' Sikes said.
``Competitive markets and competitive markets alone will in the
final analysis force prices toward true costs.''
   Rather than reregulate cable prices, which Congress is preparing
to do, Sikes said laws are needed to ease the way for
multiple-cable franchises and more competition from technologies
such as satellite broadcasters and microwave cable systems.
   On July 26 the commission voted to forward a report to Congress
urging legislation that ``limits municipal authority to erect
barriers or sustain entry barriers and which prohibits an
unreasonable refusal to grant a second (cable) franchise.''

<HEAD>ABC News Shows Offered Overseas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News, seeking new overseas markets for its
programs, said July 25 it has been showing European broadcasters
``Nightline'' and will do the same with four more programs,
including ``World News Tonight.''
   The programs are being sent via satellite to cable and TV
companies in 23 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including
Rupert Murdoch's new Sky Television direct broadcast satellite
operation, based in London, ABC said.
   Once the European television officials have had a chance to look
at ABC's programs, the network's executives will hold discussions
with the companies interested in carrying the programs, an ABC News
spokesman said.
   The evening newscasts of NBC and CBS, and ABC's ``Nightline''
already are carried in some overseas markets, including Japan.
   However, the top-rated ``World News Tonight'' isn't yet
broadcast overseas, said the ABC spokesman, Scott Richardson.
   All three U.S. network news divisions have been seeking new
markets and revenues as they lose audiences to cable and other
viewing alternatives.
   Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, an early entry in the
global news market, is seen in 90 countries, according to CNN.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first president of NBC's consumer and
business cable channel, CNBC, is leaving to form an independent
company that manages broadcast properties.
   No successor was immediately named for Michael Eskridge at the
Consumer News and Business Channel. He was named president of CNBC
in July 1988 and the service began in April 1989.
   Eskridge said July 23 that he would stay at CNBC until his
replacement is found, and denied published speculation that he was
forced out.
   NBC executives have said they expect to lose money on CNBC for
three years but predict it will have 30 million subscribers and

<HEAD>NBC Union Rejects Contract for Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major union at NBC has rejected the company's
four-year contract offer for the second time since April, but is
trying to arrange new negotiations, a union spokesman said.
   Members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians voted 1,290 to 516 to reject NBC's offer, NABET
spokesman John Krieger said July 27. ``We're trying to arrange
further bargaining talks,'' he said.
   There was no immediate comment from NBC. The union says it has
2,373 members at NBC, and at NBC-owned facilities here and in
Burbank, Calif., Washington, D.C., Chicago and Cleveland, and at
NBC news bureaus throughout the United States.
   The union, which represents local and network newswriters and
technical employees, struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting
17 weeks.
   Krieger said no strike vote had been taken, and NABET members
continued to work. Their previous contract expired March 30.
   He said main issues in contract talks include jurisdiction, the
use of people hired by the day rather than permanently, and
``four-walling'' proposals under which outside producers could rent
NBC facilities to make shows without being required to use NABET
crews employed by NBC.

   As New Hampshire's attorney general in 1976,
Supreme Court nominee David Souter submitted a brief in which the
state argued against paying for Medicaid abortions and referred to
abortion as ``the killing of unborn children.''
   In an earlier case, argued in 1972 when Souter was the state's
deputy attorney general, New Hampshire defended its strict
anti-abortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing:
``The maintenance of an unborn child's right to birth is a
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life.''
   In both cases, the extent of Souter's personal involvement is
unclear. And from neither _ one argued before and one after the
U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion
_ is it possible to determine his personal views on abortion, an
issue likely to play a major role in his September confirmation
hearings.
   New Hampshire's attorney general is appointed by the governor
and by law represents him and other state officials in court cases.
The state's governor when both abortion cases were argued was
Meldrim Thompson, a conservative abortion foe.

   Five colleges are hatching plans to help revamp
neighboring public schools this fall _ and each say they are
drawing lessons from Boston University's unprecedented management
takeover of a nearby district.
   No one is rushing to imitate Boston University's year-old,
ambitious effort to manage and radically transform the entire

students with some of the worst test scores in that state.
   But the university's 10-year plan to manage Chelsea's day-to-day
operations and raise tens of millions of dollars to finance reforms
is apparently earning national credence as colleges seek ways to
nurture school reform.
   ``I think the very positive impact of the Boston-Chelsea
relationship has been to encourage colleges to become more involved
than they have been. But I don't think the model of taking a system
over will be the way it goes,'' said Robert Atwell, president of

<HEAD>English: The Language to Learn in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORUN, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty American volunteers have come to this
city of Copernicus to teach Poles the English language they crave.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, too, the English language is
spreading rapidly as Soviet power and obligatory Russian-language
classes disappear.
   Despite efforts by France and Germany to promote the use of
their languages in the region, English appears well in the lead as
the second tongue of choice.
   Enrollment in English classes is up sharply in Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia.
   Besides asking English-speaking countries to send teachers,
Europe's new democracies are running crash training programs at
home and broadcasting British and American radio and television
programs in the original language.
   The thirst for English has contributed to explosive growth in
private language schools and is spilling over to the world of
commerce.
   At the Education Ministry, Lucyna Tarasiewicz looked puzzled
when a reporter asked why the ministry emphasized the teaching of
English over, for instance, German or Russian.
   ``Isn't your question somewhat rhetorical?'' she asked.
``Without a doubt, the majority of young people in our schools want
to learn this language. Especially recently, most contacts on this
continent are held in English.''
   Grazyna Siedlecka-Orzel, a veteran educator helping to train
English teachers, said: ``For so many years, English was
suppressed. Now nobody wants to learn Russian because English is
the language of the world.''
   Although study of Russian was required in the communist years
and classes in other languages were scarce, few students learned
Russian well because ``the motivation was extremely low,'' Mrs.
Tarasiewicz said.
   Now that Russian is treated as just another language, parents
and students are flocking to English as the ticket to a better
future. German and French are a distant second.
   Barbara Kurianiuk, who has taught for six years at Bialystok in
northeast Poland, is certified in Russiam but recently became her
high school's only teacher of English. She has six classes of 30
students each.
   How many of the 500 or so students want into those classes?
   ``I think everyone,'' she said.
   Ms. Kurianiuk said the problems were enormous. The school has no
English textbooks, and even newspapers and magazines are hard to
come by.
   Peace Corps volunteers are taking cram courses in survival
Polish at Torun's university before fanning out to cities
throughout the country. Most will teach high school students, but
the more experienced will train other teachers.
   In a foretaste of what is in store, more than 1,700 Poles
applied for 300 places in practices classes, where the volunteers
will rehearse teaching techniques.
   ``It is going to be a lot of work for us, but that's why we're
here,'' said teacher Mike Kennedy of Meriden, Conn.
   William Lovelace, head of the Peace Corps in Poland, said
English instruction topped the country's list when the United
States offered last year to send its first volunteers to Eastern
Europe.
   Sixty Peace Corps teachers each arrived in Poland and Hungary in
June and 22 are due in Czechoslovakia this fall, for a total of
142, and the same number will be added next year, Lovelace said.
   The British Voluntary Service Organization, Harvard's World
Teach and the Canadian government are offering trainers in English
and France and West Germany are sending teachers of their languages.
   English is becoming ubiquitous in Eastern Europe. Polish
television broadcasts CNN Headline News each morning and Warsaw's
Radio Solidarity carries the BBC World News.
   In Hungary, the new station Radio Bridge beams all-English
programming largely supplied by the Voice of America's Europe
Network.
   Czechoslovak television's third channel, which used to carry
Soviet programs, has become a potpourri of Western fare, with
English-language programs leading the way.
   Some grasp of English even appears necessary for Eastern
Europeans to follow the dramatic economic changes being charted for
them.
   Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovak finance minister, peppers
television speeches with terms like ``standby loans'' and
``options.'' Nearly everyone in Poland understands the term ``joint
ventures'' by now.
   On the streets, English names add a certain cachet. Warsaw
fast-food stands advertise ``hot dogs,'' but usually offer only an
approximation of pizza or rolls stuffed with stewed mushrooms.
   In Budapest, one can visit the Top Shop or Mix Shop _ even the
Boutique Shop _ and sip something refreshing at the Drink Bar.
   English is a common second language in Europe, so when a Pole or
Czech talks business with an Italian or Greek, it often is the
language used.
   Mrs. Tarasiewicz of the Education Ministry estimated Poland will
need 20,000 teachers of Western languages, including 12,000-15,000
for English, to meet the minimal requirements of students in grades
7 through 12.
   She said the ministry eventually would like to extend language
training to elementary schools, which would require 10,000 more
teachers.
   Polish schools have only 1,200 English teachers, compared with
20,000 teachers of Russian, most of whom have little to do these
days. The proportions are similar in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Few English-language majors teach in the public schools because
they can earn three times the national average salary by giving
private lessons or using their language skills in business, Mrs.
Tarasiewicz said.
   A special program to retrain Russian teachers may provide 2,000
more teachers of English in three years, she said, but the
desirable staffing level may not be reached for 15 years.
   With such a dearth of instructors, there is little concern about
whether the English being taught is American or British, Mrs.
Tarasiewicz said.
   Lovelace of the Peace Corps said: ``They would settle for
Australian or Sri Lankan English if they could get it, or West
Indian. You could have Poles with Jamaican accents walking around.''
   He added that American English seemed to be leading the British
version.
   ``If you listen to the radio here, what are they playing?'' he
said. ``U.S. country music and R &amp; B songs. I've heard more Little
Richard here than I've heard in years. The radio is telling us
something.''
   Entrepreneurs have benefited from the passion to learn English.
   ``The number of applicants is three to four times greater than
what we can admit,'' said Laszlo Simonflavy, manager of the
International Language School of Budapest. ``There is a boom in
demand for English and it is yet to level off.''
   Most students are aged 16 to 25 and prefer American English, he
said.
   Simonflavy charges $1 for attendance at a 45-minute class.
Private tutors can earn up to $10 an hour in a country where the
average monthly wage is equal to about $130.

   The French are finally throwing in the
``serviette,'' or towel, in the global battle for linguistic
supremacy.
   French officials and teachers say English is unquestionably the
No. 1 international tongue and there's little point in going
``tete-a-tete'' with it any longer.
   The Germans agree. If a battle lies ahead, it may be between
French and German for second place.
   ``We can't make a linguistic Maginot Line,'' said Bernard
Cerquiglini, a leading French authority on language. ``That's what
we've been trying to do, especially against English. It's a lost
battle.''
   Cerquiglini, who is fluent in English, heads the General
Delegation of the French Language assigned by Prime Minister Michel
Rocard to promote the study of French abroad.
   He and his colleagues hope to make French the most popular
language throuhout Europe, after English.
   ``Our strategy is to promote all European languages, to make
Europe multilingual,'' Cerquiglini said. ``The riches of Europe are
in its languages. If Europe becomes unilingual, the language will
be English. Obviously.''
   That view marks a strategic retreat in the long effort to
restore French to international leadership.
   In the 17th and 18th centuries, French was unchallenged as the
language of diplomacy and the conversation of educated people.
   The Industrial Revolution, led by Britain, made English the
language of international commerce. By the time Queen Victoria's
empire had spread English around the world, an Oxbridge accent had
as much cachet as aristocratic French.
   Diplomacy remained a francophone stronghold through the early
part of this century. The Versailles Treaty, after World War I, was
written in French and understood in that language by President
Woodrow Wilson.
   After World War II, the global role of the United States built
an unrivaled position for English. France's efforts to hold the
line have included aid to French-speaking countries, francophone
song festivals and even futile attempts to weed out ``franglais,''
English words used in common speech.
   Promoters of French see opportunity in Eastern Europe. Nations
with historic links to France are the prime targets, paticularly
Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Rocard's Cabinet said recently that promotion of French in
Eastern Europe should be ``a major component of foreign policy.''
   French television viewers were buoyed by seeing residents of
Bucharest speaking perfect French to reporters during the December
revolution in Romania. French and Romanian are based on Latin, and
French is the only Western language many Romanians know.
   ``We've had great luck so far,'' said Catherine Michaud of the
Hachette Foundation, which sent 100,000 French-language books to
Romanian libraries. ``There are plenty of people who already know
French and want to keep learning it.''
   The world's best-known French school, the Alliance Francaise,
plans to add branches this year in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It already has schools in Romania,
Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   French television is beamed to Poland and Czechoslovakia, and
bilingual radio stations are starting up.
   ``I think that a cultivated man in the Europe of tomorrow will
need at least two languages besides his own,'' said Francois
Hingue, director of foreign services for Alliance Francaise.
   ``One will be English, the other probably French, or maybe
German. In Brussels with the EEC, or Geneva in banking, French is
definitely going to be an advantage.''
   A unified, economically strong Germany may seem in a better
position to establish its language in Eastern Europe.
   Susanne Hoehn of the Goethe Institute in Munich, an organization
similar to the Alliance Francaise, said it is opening branches in
Moscow, Prague and Warsaw. She said the changes in Eastern Europe
had produced ``an extremely strong increase in interest for
German.''
   According to the Goethe Institute's figures, she said, 9.5
million people are studying German in the region and ``they need
textbooks, teachers, all kinds of teaching aides.''
   Germans in general seem less concerned with promoting their
language.
   It once was the lingua franca of science, but now ``there's a
tendency in medicine, in the sciences and engineering to publish
very much in English,'' said Werner Bies, an English specialist at
the Free University in West Berlin.
   He said ``the French try much harder'' to promote their own
language.
   The General Delegation of the French Language plans to sponsor
teacher exchanges with a unified Germany to encourage better French
instruction in the eastern sector.
   German school officials believe English will continue to be the
foreign language of choice, even among former East Germans who were
required to learn Russian.
   Cerquiglini believes the reason is partly psychological.
   ``For people who've been forced to learn Russian for a long
time, to learn Western languages like English and French is like
already having a bit of liberty,'' he said.

   The British take obvious pride in the spread of
English across the globe, but fret that the language of
Shakespeare, Milton and Barbara Cartland has been hijacked by
Americans.
   It's not just a cultural issue, but one of marketing the product
_ that is, teaching the language to other nations.
   ``We intend to replace Russian with English as the second
language throughout Eastern Europe,'' Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd said in May.
   Teaching English, or teaching English teachers, is a major
concern of the British government ``know-how funds'' established
for Eastern Europe.
   Ah, but whose English will the Europeans learn? The Independent
newspaper editorialized recently that British publishers should
``point out that they offer the superior (and European) version of
the tongue.''
   ``What self-respecting Lithuanian or Ukrainian, Czech or Pole
wants to speak English like one of Mr. Gorbachev's interpreters,
with a twang picked up from the other superpower?'' the newspaper
inquired.
   In a froth of linguistic jingoism, reporter Gerard Evans wrote
in the newspaper Today that Britain faced ``being blown out'' of
the booming English-language market in Eastern Europe:
   ``All over Romania, Bulgaria and the like, sidewalks are full of
rambunctious kids slupping (sic) Pepsi, sucking face with their
chicks and dreaming of Gekkoing into the world of business and big
simoleons. When it comes to studying `proper' English grammar and
syntax, they'll take a raincheck, thank you.''
   Julian Amey, executive director of BBC English, feels it isn't
helpful to draw broad contrasts between British English and
American English.
   ``It's a worldwide language and the variants are not that
vital,'' he said in an interview. Amey described English
instruction as a huge and growing market with ample opportunities
``for all agencies, British and American, that can provide
services.''
   A report in 1989 by the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated
the market value of the language at 6 billion pounds (nearly $11
billion) a year. It said Britain controlled about one-sixth of the
market, mainly through courses and textbooks, and the U.S.-Canadian
share was twice that.
   The BBC teaches English by radio, television and print. Its
English-teaching cartoon character, ``Muzzy in Gondoland,'' appears
on Soviet television and in France, Italy, Spain and Mexico, Amey
said.
   Moscow radio's medium-wave service carries BBC radio classes, he
said, and the bimonthly magazine BBC English just signed up 700
subscribers in Czechoslovakia.
   Tom McArthur, editor of the learned journal English Today, said
the competition of British and American English was a contest
between a 19th century empire and a 20th century superpower,
between the BBC World Service and Hollywood.
   Britain's old guard resents it, he said in an interview.
   ``They find it a little difficult to accept the enormous
pressures on British English from American English,'' McArthur
said. ``There is much more traveling from you to us than from us to
you.''
   American English may be slightly easier to learn, he said,
because it uses ``spelling pronunciation.'' For instance, an
American has a secretary while a Briton has a secret'ry.
   Japanese, on the other hand, might find British English more
attractive because it doesn't pronounce the troublesome R, McArthur
said.
   Which English will be spoken in Bucharest and Warsaw 20 years
from now? ``I would expect to hear both,'' he said, ``because the
influence of the BBC and British publishers is so great.''

   Today is Saturday, Aug. 11, the 223rd day of 1990. There are 142
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Aug. 11, 1965, rioting and looting
broke out in the predominantly black Watts section of Los Angeles
after police arrested a black man suspected of drunken driving. In
the week that followed, 34 people were killed and more than 1,000
injured.
   On this date:
   In 1860, the nation's first successful silver mill began
operation near Virginia City, Nev.
   In 1909, the SOS distress signal was first used by an American
ship, the Arapahoe, off Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   In 1934, the first federal prisoners arrived at the island
prison Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.
   In 1945, the Allies responded to Japan's offer to surrender
provided Emperor Hirohito retain his sovereignty. The Allies said
they would determine the Emperor's future status.
   In 1954, a formal peace took hold in Indochina, ending more than
seven years of fighting between the French and Communist Vietminh.
   In 1956, abstract artist Jackson Pollock died in an automobile
accident in East Hampton, N.Y.
   In 1962, the Soviet Union launched cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev
into orbit for a flight that would last more than 94 hours.
   In 1975, the United States vetoed the proposed admission of
North and South Vietnam to the United Nations, following the
Security Council's refusal to consider South Korea's application.
   In 1978, chiefs of state and foreign dignitaries arrived in
Vatican City for the funeral of Pope Paul VI, who died Aug. 6.
Leading the U.S. delegation was First Lady Rosalynn Carter.
   In 1984, during a voice test for a paid political radio address,
President Reagan joked that he had ``signed legislation that will
outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.''
   In 1984, Carl Lewis won his fourth gold medal of the 1984 Summer
Olympics as he helped the U.S. Men's 400-meter relay team to
victory.
   Ten years ago: Hours before the Democratic national convention
   opened in New York, Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy withdrew
from the race.
   Five years ago: Toxic gas leaked from the Union Carbide
pesticide plant in Institute, W.Va, prompting 135 people to seek
medical treatment at hospitals.
   One year ago: Poland's Solidarity-dominated Senate adopted a
resolution expressing sorrow over Polish participation in the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Today's Birthdays: Author Alex Haley is 69. TV talk show host
   Mike Douglas is 65. Newspaper columnist Carl Rowan is 65. The Rev.
Jerry Falwell is 57. Actress Anna Massey is 53. Singer Eric Carmen
is 41.
   Thought for Today: ``Bigotry has no head, and cannot think; no
   heart, and cannot feel.'' -- Daniel O'Connell, Irish political
leader (1775-1847).

<HEAD>Soviet Opposition Leaders Say Gorbachev's Time is Gone</HEAD>

   They are devout, intense, orthodox in their
Russian religion and unorthodox in their politics, men from Moscow
who contend that the only way to reform the Soviet Union is to
dissolve it.
   They are telling Americans in and out of government that while
their nation needs aid _ massive aid _ it should not be channeled
through Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a man whose time, they say, has gone.
   Instead, they want the West to work with individual republics
like Russia, with local governments and with independent
cooperatives, businesses and organizations like their Christian
Democratic Party.
   Sipping ice water in a conference room at the conservative think
tank that is sponsoring their week-long U.S. visit, they take turns
telling, through an interpreter, of plans and goals that seem far
beyond their reach.
   Gleb Yakunin, a Russian orthodox priest; Victor Aksyuchits, the
party chairman, and Valery Borshchov, a member of the Moscow City
Council, use differing words to preach the same political sermon _
U.S. policy should not be tied to Gorbachev's government.
   Yakunin's black cassock and silver cross do not fit the image of
a political figure, but his words do. And he seems to be first
among this political threesome, all threatened as dissidents, and
Yakunin imprisoned, before the reforms for which they credit
Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev has done great historic service by starting this
process,'' Yakunin said. ``But now ... events have gone beyond
him.''
   ``So we need new forces now, to carry through the reform,'' said
Aksyuchits. ``The Communist Party is not capable of doing it.''
   The aims and agenda these three men outline sounds impractical,
unrealistic, far beyond reach.
   But it bears mention that only eight months ago, Vytautas
Landsbergis, a quiet music teacher and parliamentarian, came to
Washington to tell the few who would listen that Lithuanians meant
to declare their independence of the Soviet Union, and wanted the
United States to help make it stick.
   He got to see an assistant secretary of state. Then he went home
and became president of a breakaway Lithuania.
   Yakunin, Aksyuchits and Borshchov are making the rounds at the
State Department, the Capitol and, today, with an appointment to
see White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.
   They won't gain encouragement for their suggestion that the
United States and the West work around Gorbachev instead of through
his government, although the administration has said it is seeking
contacts with some of the opposition political and economic
movements in the Soviet Union.
   Diplomacy and economic business are conducted on a
government-to-government basis, and that means U.S. officials deal
with Gorbachev.
   The administration wants his policies to succeed. While
President Bush has rejected direct U.S. economic aid, West Germany
is offering assistance, beginning with $3.1 billion in guaranteed
bank loans, and other European allies may help, too. The United
States has not ruled out technical assistance and advice.
   The opposition politicians agree that aid is needed but want it
routed to political and economic organizations they say can make up
a new ``civil society'' to take over from communism.
   ``The West shouldn't place all its bets on Gorbachev,'' said
Aksyuchits. ``That would be a mistake.''
   ``It's necessary to deal not with yesterday's structures, but
with tomorrow's structures,'' Yakunin said. ``The Soviet empire is
the last great empire, and the time has come for this great empire
to leave the stage of history.''
   He said it will be replaced by a looser but lasting political
union among Soviet republics.
   The three Russians came to New York and Washington under the
sponsorship of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative
political organization that has been conducting training missions
on democratic process for opposition parties and their leaders, in
the Soviet Union and in eastern Europe.
   Their Russian Christian Democratic Movement was founded in 1987;
when opposition political parties were legalized earlier this year,
it became one. Their platform is a densely worded blend of religion
and politics. They claim broad popular support in Russia.
   Yakunin couldn't guess how many opposition parties have been
created in the Soviet Union this year. ``Nobody really knows,'' he
said. ``Dozens and dozens. Like soap bubbles. Some disappear.''
   He said a handful will be the forces of democracy in the future,
and the Christian Democrats will be one of them.
   Those claims of party strength are subject to proof. The power
of the independent political movements already is on display.

^Deborah Norville Inspects Advertising</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last August, Deborah Norville anchored ``Bad
Girls.'' About violent teenaged girls, it was the sort of
documentary that used to sprout only in Geraldo Rivera country.
Sure, it got high ratings.
   Tonight, she anchors another NBC News summer special bearing the
snappy title, ``Sex, Buys and Advertising.''
   Cowabunga, you say, give me a break.
   Oddly enough, the show isn't all bad, even though it's not
exactly hard-hitting. It's even good in some parts, including its
segments on product plugs in movies, advertising that is steadily
creeping into classrooms, and the use of star athletes to tout
high-cost sneakers that some ghetto kids literally kill for.
   But those who expect a tabloid approach because of the ``Sex''
in the show's title can properly accuse NBC of deceptive
show-titling.
   The only real s-e-x stuff is an early segment on how the Estee
Lauder cosmetics giant is planning its coming megabucks campaign,
which includes $6 million to model Paulina Porizkova to be its one
and only mannequin.
   Says Paulina: ``Advertising is a little bit of a dream.''
   Students of the salacious will not give this part the Wowee
Award.
   Norville, who has noisily suffered the slings and arrows of
outrageous critics ever since Jane Pauley made way for her on
``Today,'' starts things with a quick look at memorable commercials
of yesteryear.
   Then, in what proves a frequent ability to toss off a cliche,
she informs viewers that ``if you feel you've been bombarded with
more ads than ever before, you're right.''
   Moments later, you will hear her say: ``Advertisers say it's
getting harder and harder to reach the consumer because we're
surrounded by so many ads. The average American is bombarded by
1,000 television commercials a week.''
   Unfortunately, neither she Norville nor her co-writer, Rhonda
Schwartz, the show's producer, inquire about what may be the real
issue: whether so many ads result in viewers now recalling only one
long, bright-colored blur.
   The show is broad in scope, but too broad. Its segment on the
commercial bombardment of children could have been made a special
of itself.
   Or, if NBC wanted, well, ratings, Norville could have devoted an
hour to celebrity advertising pitches here and abroad. Brief
samples show poverty-stricken actors Eddie Murphy and Arnold
Schwarzenegger trying to earn a yen in Japanese commercials.
   The show's basic worth is as a once-over-lightly primer on
modern advertising, including ``target advertising'' at blacks and
Hispanics, teens and pre-teens, and what critics of all this have
to say.
   But there are times the show could have used a sense of silly,
as when:
   _ A co-creator of the celebrated ad for Infiniti tries to
explain why the ad didn't include the car in the commercial.
   _ A major ad agency doing research on Teens Who Buy dispatches
an anthropologist ``to secretly observe teen-age behavior on
fast-food restaurants.''
   _ New York's ``hottest, hippest'' ad agency tries to land the
Carvel ice cream account. The agency's young co-founders, who seem
straight out of ``thirtysomething,'' lose. You feel for them. How
sad it is to be hot and hip, and still lose the Carvel ice cream
account.
   There also is a world of funny material also lurking in the
segment on product-plugging _ for a fee _ in movies. The citations
include the Pepsi requested by Michael J. Fox in ``Back to the
Future.''
   Norville asks Fox _ who earlier is seen making a Pepsi
commercial and earning a reported $1 million for same _ if
product-pluggings in films ``compromise the art of film-making.''
   ``It does, to a certain extent,'' says Michael J. Fox.``But
let's face it it ... there is a certain amount of commerce at work
here beyond `let's just make a good movie.'''
   Alas, Norville &amp; Co. treat all this very earnestly and soberly.
They even end the night by noting that ``advertising is here to
stay,'' and that parents and consumers alike need to make sensible
buying decisions.
   You kind of wish NBC had cut out the sillier segments out and
given them to a journalist with perspective, like Steve Dunleavy or
someone.
   Well, no real harm done. And at least it's not ``Bad Girls _ The
Sequel.'' But we must urge whoever wrote the ending credits for
Norville's show to do just a little bit more research next time.
   Under the heading of ``additional films courtesy of,'' credit is
given KGO-TV in Sacramento. This may surprise KGO-TV, because it is
in San Francisco.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He was America's most controversial architect, a
flamboyant innovator. Now, three decades after his death, Frank
Lloyd Wright is appreciated far more than at any time in his long
career. But scores of the buildings that reflect his distinctive
style have vanished and his fans are taking steps to save those
that remain.

   Now that he has been placed on equal
footing with the Greek firm of Ictinus and Callicrates that
designed the Parthenon, a serious effort is under way to save Frank
Lloyd Wright's surviving buildings from being knocked down.
   ``It's sinful, sinful,'' exclaims Jeanette Fields, looking out
the window of her Wright-designed house in nearby River Forest,
Ill., watching a group of Japanese tourists who are looking in.
   ``Tokyo's Imperial Hotel is gone. The Larkin building in Buffalo
was torn down for no sane reason. Chicago's Midway Gardens went to
the wrecker's ball. And look what they're doing to the Guggenheim
Museum in New York.''
   The tourists, she says, come by the busload, beginning as soon
as the sun comes up. They are Frank Lloyd Wright fans, armed with
cameras, maps and cassette recorders, hot on the trail of 33 houses
and 10 ``bootlegs'' _ moonlighting jobs while working as a
draftsman for architect Louis Sullivan _ that Wright built between
1889 in 1909 in Oak Park and adjoining River Forest, 10 miles west
of Chicago.
   Built in 190l, hers is one of the earliest of Wright's ``Prairie
School'' houses, which still draw admirers from around the world.
   Mrs. Fields, who admits to being ``kicked out of several dinner
parties for getting very emotional about people selling off Wright
windows and woodwork,'' is a director of the recently formed Frank
Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy.
   The conservancy is a consortium of Wright homeowners, curators
of Wright house museums, architects, and preservationists. It is
the latest manifestation of growing public concern about preserving
the surviving 347 buildings designed by Wright in a career that
spanned seven decades.
   Sixty-seven buildings already have vanished and many others are
seriously deteriorating. They are under threat from urban sprawl
and developers, or prey to scavengers in the booming market for
Wright artifacts such as art glass windows and decorative woodwork.
   Preserving what's left is no easy task, concedes Oak Park
architect John Thorpe, who has had a hand in restoring 21 Frank
Lloyd Wright houses.
   ``If the building is in really decrepit condition, you're going
to pay a lot more for restoration than you did for the property,''
he says. ``That's why cannibalism is so lethal to our efforts. The
temptation is to sell off one or two windows, which can bring
$250,000 or so on the art market, to pay off the restoration.
   ``Fortunately, the people who buy and live in these houses today
are not unlike the special brand of thinking clients who were the
original owners and had faith in Wright's off-beat ideas. They know
what's different about these houses: the natural light, the feeling
of shelter, the openness, the sheer comfort.''
   ``Restoration takes tact. It's like telling a neighbor to fix up
his garage,'' says preservationist Frank Pond, who is active in
saving Unity Temple, the Unitarian church in Oak Park that was
Wright's first public building.
   The church, he says, was built for $40,000. ``Our restoration
surveys cost more.''
   Wright, who died 31 years ago at age 91, is far more appreciated
and revered now than at any time in a flamboyant career. The
architect, who never lacked self-esteem, was scorned for his
leaving a wife and six kids to run off with a client's wife. Then
there was the gory murder of his mistress, two of her children and
four workmen by a crazed employee.
   He was endlessly ducking bill collectors, soothing clients over
leaky roofs and cost overruns that sometimes ran into the millions.
   ``Honest arrogance'' was Wright's justification for treating
clients, critics and creditors like unruly children. But the dapper
charmer in the porkpie hat, flowing tie and opera cape probably
never envisioned that 70,000 tourists a year would troop through
the home and studio in Oak Park, which he started with a $5,000
loan and which has just undergone a 12-year, $2.1 million
restoration.
   ``He must be up there chuckling,'' says Jeanette Fields, who
concedes that her restoration costs were ``many, many times over''
the price paid by the original owner, E. Arthur Davenport, who
worked for the Illinois Central railroad.
   The vault of heaven may also echo with chuckles at the recent
sale of a Wright dining room table and chairs for $1.6 million and
Christie's auctioning off one of his floor lamps for $704,000 and
another lamp, together with an oak music cabinet, for $330,000.
   No fewer than 12 Wright houses are now museums, including
fabulous Fallingwater, perched over that waterfall in Bear Run,
Pa., the Mayer-May house in Grand Rapids, Mich., refurbished to its
original glory in a two-year, multimillion-dollar restoration, and
the Dana-Thomas house in Springfield, Ill., undergoing a $4.6
million restoration funded by the Illinois legislature.
   In Japan, where Wright has had a fanatical following since his
first visit in 1903, an outdoor museum near Nagoya has reproduced
in authentic scale the facade of his earthquake-proof Imperial
Hotel. This daring classic, which he ``floated'' on pilings sunk in
the soft mud bottom and ``delicately balanced like a tray on the
fingertips of a waiter,'' survived the great Tokyo earthquake and
fire of 1923 but fell to the wrecker's ball in 1967.
   An agreement has just been reached to reproduce and market
Wright's furniture, which 20 years ago, according to Chicago
preservationist Timothy Barton, ``you couldn't get the Salvation
Army to cart away.''
   His original drawings are valued in the tens of millions of
dollars.

   And what other architect three decades after his death goes on
pleasing clients with his ``office tragedies'' _ buildings that for
lack of funds or other reasons never got built in his lifetime? In
recent years, some 15 Wright designs have been executed in half a
dozen states.
   ``We frequently get inquiries about his blueprints,'' says
architect Charles Montooth, who recently erected Wright-designed
houses in Ann Arbor and Santa Fe. ``Interest in Mr. Wright goes in
waves, and each time the peak gets a little higher.
   ``Until recently people didn't realize he designed fabrics and
furniture. Now galleries and collectors are bidding up his
artifacts like Impressionist paintings.''
   Montooth is a fellow at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of
Architecture and a member of Taliesin Associated Architects, the
firm that continues his ideas and principles.
   Architects still operate out of Wright's two former
headquarters, Taliesin North in Spring Green, Wis. and Taliesin
West near Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``There are problems building from old plans,'' says Montooth,
leading a guest on a tour of Taliesin North's sandstone and native
oak buildings that seemed to grow out a hillside. ``Building codes
and client requirements change over the years. Costs go up. A house
that could be built for $20,000 in the '30s might run you a
quarter-million now.
   ``And Mr. Wright kept changing his ideas as he went along. He
was like Thomas Jefferson at Monticello: From day to day he never
saw a project the same way.''
   Montooth recalls the early days at Taliesin West in Arizona.
``It was just a glorified tent but Mr. Wright, in his 70s then, had
to have his grand piano. He loved grand pianos and fast cars. Mr.
Wright believed apprentices should learn by building, so we lived
in tents while we built in the desert.''
   Yamesee Plantation near Charleston, S.C., which was in
deplorable decay, is undergoing a multimillion-dollar restoration.
In addition outer buildings that Wright designed and never saw
built are in the overall plan.
   The proprietor is movie producer Joel Silver, who already lives
in a Wright house in Hollywood _ Storer House, a Pompeiian villa
remarkable for having no front door. Wright liked his entrances
secluded, mysterious, evoking our primitive ancestors finding
shelter in a cave.
   But in other areas preservation of the legacy is far from
encouraging, reports Carla Lind, executive director of the
Conservancy. She and others lament new additions to the Marin
County Civic Center north of San Francisco and the Guggenheim
Museum in New York.
   Under court pressure to relieve overcrowding, Marin County has
planned a new jail that Wright preservationists say would obstruct
the view and destroy the ground-hugging grandeur of his
quarter-mile-long, pink stucco center that leaps over roads and
three small hills in graceful arches. Admirers compare it with Pont
du Gard, the Roman aqueduct in Provence.
   Erecting the jail, protested Preserve Our Civic Center, an
advocacy group, would be ``like putting a Taco Bell in front of the
Taj Mahal.''
   Similar anguished cries resulted in some modification of plans
to expand the Guggenheim, Wright's swirling concrete cone in New
York City which has been hailed as his East Coast masterpiece.
   Wright fans are still unreconciled by the revised plans.
   ``They scrapped the first proposal which was an absolute
monstrosity and came up with a second which is less monstrous,''
said Roland Reisley, secretary of the conservancy. ``But from our
viewpoint it is a serious loss to the integrity of one of the
world's most glorious spaces.''
   Throughout his career Wright never lost interest in low-income
housing.
   Chicago has given landmark protection to the partly burned-out
and deteriorating Waller Apartments, which rented for $12 a month
at the turn of the century, and to the abused and neglected 1894
Roloson Buildings, his only row houses.
   ``Both would cost more to restore than replace, but they cry out
for some philanthrophic endowment to save them,'' says Timothy
Barton, a preservation specialist with the Chicago Landmark
Commission. ``Some of the windows surfaced as recently as two
months ago on the art market and are worth more than the property.''
   The encouraging news for Wright fans is that a number of museums
now refuse to acquire fixtures and furniture scavenged from his
surviving buildings.
   Conservancy director Lind has not given up hope of rescuing the
sadly decaying A.D.German warehouse, an impressive Mayan-style
temple in Richland Center, Wis., that Wright created in 1916 for
one of his many creditors. Certainly the world's most bizarre
warehouse, it had room to store coal, grain and feed supplies, as
well as retail shops, an art gallery and a restaurant.
   ``Richland Center is Wright's birthplace and it would make an
appropriate town hall,'' she says.

   Frank Lloyd Wright was as adroit at delivering a line as he was
at drawing one. To wit:
   ``It would be cheaper to abandon Pittsburgh than rebuild it.'' _
Wright's urban renewal recipe.
   ``A colorful, happy environment abundant with music.'' _
Wright's elegiac description of a San Francisco funeral parlor that
never got built.
   ``He should have been a painter. He was a bad one, but he should
have kept on.'' _ Wright's verdict on Swiss architect Le Corbusier.
   ``Those skinny glass boxes! Why, I wouldn't dare walk on the
same side of the street with them. The fool things might explode.
That's from a fellow who knew what architecture was when all these
glass-box boys were just so many diapers on a line.'' _ Wright's
opinion of modern architecture and architects in the New Yorker
magazine.
   ``If you look after luxuries, the necessities will take care of
themselves.'' _ Wright's philosophy of extravagant living.
   ``Let 'em call out the militia!'' _ Wright defies the building
code bureaucrats in going ahead with the now-classic Johnson Wax
building in Racine, Wis.

Johnson, who commissioned a family residence after the Johnson Wax
building, telephoned to complain the roof was leaking onto their
Thanksgiving dinner.

   Many of the dreams and schemes of Frank Lloyd Wright never came
to fruition. For example, he envisioned:
   _A steel cathedral for New York City, over 1,000 feet high, with
space for a million worshipers ``of all denominations.''
   _A cultural center on an island in the Tigris, as fantastic as
anything in the Arabian Nights, for the King of Iraq. The king,
unfortunately, was assassinated before the project got off the
drafting board.
   _The ``Mile High Illinois Building,'' a 500-story tower for
state offices in Chicago, with room for 100,000 civil servants,
15,000 automobiles and 100 helicopters.
   _A proposed state capitol for Arizona, a sprawling, horizontal,
canopy-like structure, all on one level, with gardens, fountains
and pools, which Wright deemed ``a true oasis in the desert.''
   _A ``butterfly-wing'' bridge across San Francisco Bay, proposed
by Wright in 1949 and now the subject of serious renewed interest
since last October's disastrous earthquake.
   _Broadacre City, a planned community to replace the crowded
cities: no grade crossings, billboards or utility poles, houses all
on one-acre plots, tree-shaded, flower-lined roads and some
``noiseless'' airfields, for commuting to work, distribution and
recreation areas, all within a radius of 50 to 100 miles.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ What's a black liberal Congressman from
Pennsylvania doing campaigning for a white conservative in the
Mississippi Delta? Trying to win votes for Democrats, that's what.
A reporter recently followed House Majority Whip William H. Gray
III, sometimes called ``The Stealth Whip'' by his colleagues, on a
foray into the Deep South.

   Freshman Rep. Mike Parker introduces House
Majority Whip William H. Gray III to his Mississippi Delta district
with an analogy between the ways of Washington and life in the wild.
   To survive, the gazelle must outrun the swiftest lion, and Gray,
he says, ``is the slickest and fastest gazelle in Washington D.C.''
   As holder of the No. 3 leadership spot in the House, Gray surely
is at the front of the pack. After little more than a decade in
Congress, the Pennsylvania Democrat is in line to become the first
black Speaker of the House and part of a small group of blacks
mentioned as possible candidates on a future Democratic national
ticket.
   He reached that stratum because political opposites such as
Parker, a conservative white Democrat, have come to view him as an
ally rather than an enemy.
   Gray, visiting Jackson on a recent warm, moist day to campaign
for Parker, is the first outside Democratic leader that Parker has
brought to his district. He is expected to help with what political
analysts call ``crossover'' support.
   Parker won his seat in 1988 refusing to endorse Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, never mind Jesse Jackson, the winner of
Mississippi's Democratic primary. But his Delta district is 37
percent black, and he, like many Southern Democrats, must hold the
black vote.
   But to say Parker wanted Gray to visit just because of race is
wrong.
   Gray ``confirms the connection with power in the House, which
Mississippi likes,'' says Ed Cole, Parker's top aide and the
Mississippi Democratic party chairman.
   Parker cites his personal rapport with Gray as the main reason
for the invitation, especially the Northern liberal's
``understanding that the country is different.''
   ``Bill Gray exemplifies the type of leadership and substance
that attracts Democratic voters,'' says Hiram Eastland, a lawyer
and cousin of the late Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss. Gray has
``appeal that crosses racial and party lines,'' he says.
   Gray, 48, came to Congress in 1979 and, as chairman of the
freshman class, quickly learned about the breadth of viewpoints. He
cut his teeth on forming coalitions when he won the chairmanship of
the House Budget Committee in 1984.
   As budget chairman for four years, then chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus, chairman of the 1988 Democratic Party platform
committee, and for the past year majority whip, Gray has found
consensus where critics said it couldn't exist.
   He also has found admirers in odd places.
   ``Gray is not a standard ideological politician,'' says Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip who is Gray's
opposite number on the House floor and in philosophy. ``We both
have a sense of mutual understanding which might surprise people.''
   It wouldn't surprise them much, though.
   Campaigning with Parker, Gray knows how to enhance his own power
without flaunting it. How to nurture friendships by avoiding
potential arguments.
   His job this day is to boost Parker and Mississippi Democrats,
not himself.
   ``Mike is already making his presence felt,'' he tells preachers
gathered to hear him at the Piney Woods Country Life School, an
academy for black children outside Jackson.
   The bespectacled, balding Gray, who still fulfills his Sunday
duties as minister at the Bright Hope Baptist Church in
Pennsylvania, delivers polished rhetoric. The clergymen take notes,
no doubt stealing a few lines for their Sunday sermons, and give
their Northern colleague an ovation.
   Before leaving the school, Gray gives students an impromptu pep
talk on personal success and the scourge of drugs. Then he and
Parker zip downtown for a luncheon at a local restaurant with state
Democratic officials.
   Gray ``is a reconciliator ... He understands it takes 51 percent
of the votes to win elections,'' Secretary of State Dick Molpus
tells the group. The audience includes Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., a
Gray protege who is the only black in the state's congressional
delegation.
   Gray delivers a message of party pride and unity. ``It's easy
for the other team to get together because they all look alike,
walk alike, are crazy alike,'' he says. ``We come in all colors.''
   It was about his only mention of race all day. He talks more of
Mississippi, its powerful Democratic House delegation, and his own
roots in the South. Gray was born in Baton Rouge, La.

   ``Mike, where's the catfish,'' he jokingly complains to Parker
at event after event where they served trendy banquet food that
could have been shipped from Washington.
   During an afternoon break, he exchanges his suit and tie for
shorts and a T-shirt and plays tennis with Parker and Rep. G.V.
``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., another conservative friend.
   Then it's back into his congressional uniform for more
fund-raising and mingling.
   State Rep. Bill Wheeler, who is white, said having an
``inclusive leader'' like Gray come to Mississippi was important.
``The conflict between black and white ... is one of the major
reasons'' the state is last in national rankings for education and
wealth, he says.
   Back in Washington, Gray doesn't give his votes to the
conservatives. He represents his district with a record that
consistently gets a ``zero'' in the American Conservative Union
ratings.
   What Gray does give to conservative and liberal Democrats alike,
especially those in tough races, is money.
   He has a political action committee, the Committee for
Democratic Opportunity, which donated more than $72,000 to other
House members and aspirants this election cycle. The list includes
Parker and Gene Taylor, D-Miss., a new House member so conservative
he's frequently rumored to be switching parties.
   Gray also has contributed money from his personal campaign
treasury to candidates and the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which helps all the party's House candidates.
   A sought-after speechmaker at business and interest-group
gatherings, Gray collected $164,098 in honorariums last year, among
Congress' highest.
   While appealing to a wide audience, Gray carefully maintains his
high profile in the black community. He has been a prime sponsor of
legislation to send food aid to Ethiopia and impose economic
sanctions on apartheid South Africa.
   Other black lawmakers are quick to recognize Gray's achievements.
   ``He's a Jackie Robinson in the Congress of the United States,''
says Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, referring to the great athlete who broke through the
color barrier in major league baseball.
   Sometimes the political juggling act is delicate.
   Gray appeared on behalf of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., earlier this
year and, after he left, Savage told the gathering that Jews were
financing his primary election opponent. Many observers considered
Savage's comments anti-Semitic.
   Despite pressure from Jewish groups, Gray refused to comment on
the incident for days until he could watch a videotape of Savage's
speech. Then he condemned the remarks in a carefully worded
statement that mended fences without vilifying Savage.
   For all his moderation, Gray has shown that when directly
attacked, he can strike back with viper-like quickness.
   Last year, when he was running for whip, a Justice Department
official confirmed a ``leak'' that the FBI was investigating
financial irregularities in Gray's congressional office.
   Gray immediately denied he was under investigation and blasted
the department, which is led by Attorney General and former
Pennsylvania political foe Dick Thornburgh. Gray reacted so
fiercely that the leak became as big a story as the investigation
itself.
   He forced the Justice Department to take the unusual step of
issuing a statement that Gray was not a target of the investigation
and was cooperating with the probe.
   Gray's response rallied his supporters. He not only survived but
won the whip's job handily over Reps. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., and
David Bonior, D-Mich.
   The whip's job is that of chief vote-counter and head-knocker
for the Democratic leadership as it tries to pass legislation.
   Gray's busy schedule of campaigning, speechmaking and other
travel, including his church duties, has made him a less-visible
presence on the House floor than his predecessors.
   He relies on his staff to carry out the dull but important
details of the job, and checks in by phone from the road.
   In his first year as whip, Gray also has deferred to Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt and Speaker Thomas Foley when it comes to
leading the party charge on major issues.
   His style has earned him the in-House moniker, ``The Stealth
Whip,'' and a few fellow Democrats grumble privately that
Republicans have squeezed through some things they shouldn't have.
   But he's lost only on one major vote so far, when the House last
year passed President Bush's capital gains tax cut over the
objections of the Democratic leadership.
   ``That was one we never could win,'' Gray recalls.
   His low profile is deliberate, he explains.
   ``I see myself as the chief of the engine room,'' he says. ``The
speaker and the majority leader are up on the bridge calling for
full speed ahead, and I've got to give it to them.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Tourist guidebooks rarely tell you that there
was once a hotel in Washington with cells in the basement to hold
newly purchased slaves. Or that blacks were once forbidden to
perform at Constitution Hall. Or that blacks were barred from
sitting in the audience at the National Theater. But that has
changed with publication of a new book looking at the black side of
the blackest big city in America.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the rest of America thinks of Washington,
the city _not Washington, the world capital _ what easily comes to
mind is crime, drugs, poverty, corruption.
   Washington did have 438 homicides last year, more than one a
day. It does have an infant mortality rate like that of Third World
countries. A fifth of its people do live in poverty. Its mayor was
put on trial for using cocaine.
   All too true, but incomplete. Washington is also a community, a
place to grow up in, a place where people worry about tent
caterpillars, harangue the city government to get a new trash can,
and take pride in sons and daughters marching to ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' at high school graduations.
   It has a ``state'' bird (the wood thrush), flower (the American
beauty rose) and tree (the scarlet oak).
   Two things make it different. It is the national capital. And it
is the blackest big city in America. Seventy percent of its
residents are black, a higher proportion than Atlanta, Detroit,
Newark, N.J. or Birmingham, Ala.
   Washington's status as capital and black city have intersected
for generations. And history, largely hidden, has been made at the
intersection.
   A new guidebook, ``The Guide to Black Washington,'' by two
Washingtonians, one white, one black, offers a chance to glimpse
Washington as a black place and as a place where blacks made
history.
   The guide is intended to fit into a car's glove compartment,
offering a few paragraphs on the schools, churches, theaters,
homes, hotels, monuments, cafes, even the alleys, important to
Washington's history as a black city.
   ``For 200 years,'' say authors Sandra Fitzpatrick and Maria R.
Goodwin, ``the threads of two distinct communities have been woven
through the intricate web of federal and local interests in
Washington _ the traditionally dominant white population and a
vibrant, thriving black community which has attained majority
status over the past three decades.''
   So while other guidebooks tell how many steps there are to the
top inside the Washington Monument (898), this one suggests how
confusing the ground rules must have been when Washington was
rigidly segregated by law and custom.
   Here's how confusing:
   Black people could sit in the audience of Constitution Hall, but
blacks could not perform on stage.
   Black actors, on the other hand, could play the National
Theater, but blacks were barred from attending performances.
   At Griffith Stadium, the old ballpark, blacks could cheer the
Washington Senators but, until baseball broke the color line after
World War II, no black could play for the Senators or any other
major league team.
   However, the National Negro League had use of the field when the
Senators were on the road.
   One day in 1942, the often somnambulantSenators drew all of
3,000 fans for an afternoon game. That night, the black Homestead
Grays drew 28,000.
   That's the kind of everyday history Ms. Fitzpatrick and Ms.
Goodwin revel in.
   ``We wrote the book for the white and black residents and to get
the tourists off the Mall,'' says Ms. Fitzpatrick. ``The Mall is
fine, but there's more to this town than that.''
   Ms. Fitzpatrick, white, is the co-owner of a Washington art
gallery and wife of a prominent lawyer. She grew up in West
Lafayette, Ind., but she's lived in Washington since 1959, long
enough to be considered a Washingtonian. As a guide on Smithsonian
walking tours, she came to know all the city's neighborhoods, white
and black.
   Ms. Goodwin is a historian for the U.S. Mint. She was
researching a bibliography of Washington's history when she and
Mrs. Fitzpatrick found each other and decided to collaborate.
   Their guide recaptures the flavor of the time when the Howard
Theater, the city's first legitimate theater for blacks, would put
on four shows a day, at 2, 5, 7:30 and 10 p.m. and again at
midnight on Saturdays.
   In sharp contrast to the stiff-necked segregation at the
National Theater, whites could make up a quarter of the audience at
the Howard, and white bands, such as Artie Shaw's, often performed
on stage. Pearl Bailey made her show business debut there as a
member of the chorus line, ``the Howardettes.''
   The guide calls attention to institutions still flourishing _
like Ben's Chili Bowl, where comedian Bill Cosby courted his wife
and still drops in when he's in town _ as well as landmarks long
gone, some gone with good riddance.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: good riddance.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Blissfully gone are the alleys of shacks which for a century
were to Washington what tenements were to New York: squalid,
unwholesome, smelly places. Only their names were attractive.
   Slop Bucket Row and Louse Alley were on Capitol Hill. In Goat
Alley, in the Shaw neighborhood, lived 400 black people and one
white family in 1900.
   Long gone, too, is the St. Charles Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue,
which before the Civil War catered to a Southern clientele. It
provided six basement cells where guests could keep slaves newly
purchased from the city's slave market. A sign posted by management
made this offer: ``In case of escape, full value of the negro will
be paid by the Proprietor.''
   Lincoln ended slavery in Washington, but segregation only became
more deeply entrenched.
   Long before the Lincoln Memorial was erected _ and dedicated at
a 1922 ceremony at which honored black guests sat in an all-Negro
section _ freed black slaves collected money to erect their own
tribute to the great emancipator.
   The Emancipation Memorial, near Capitol Hill, is a statue
portraying a black man breaking his chains as Lincoln holds the
Emancipation Proclamation in his outstretched hand.
   In 1939, the steps of the Lincoln Memorial were the scene of an
extraordinary concert, a landmark event in black and Washington
history.
   Contralto Marian Anderson sang there before 75,000 people on an
Easter Sunday; she had been denied use of Constitution Hall by its
owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution.
   Twenty-four years later, Martin Luther King Jr., standing at the
same place, delivered his ``I have a Dream'' speech during a march
on Washington to petition Congress to pass a civil rights bill.
   ``We were struck by how many of our black neighbors played out
their lives on the national stage,'' says Ms. Fitzpatrick.
   She ticks some off _ jazzman Duke Ellington, who grew up on T
Street and also played the Howard Theater (a handsome local bridge
is named for him now); Charles Houston, ``Mr. Civil Rights,'' who
argued cases before the Supreme Court, including the monumental
Brown vs. Board of Education, which desegregated schools across
America and in its capital; and Frederick Douglass, the early black
statesman (namesake of another bridge in this city of rivers).
   Douglass, born into slavery, escaped to the North, bought his
own freedom with his own earnings and as an anti-slavery lecturer
became the spokesman for his race.
   Lincoln called him ``the most meritorious man of the 19th
century.'' He lived in a row house, near the Capitol. He spoke at
the dedication of the Emancipation Memorial. President Ulysses S.
Grant was a guest.
   Some of the guidebook's other landmarks and personalities:
   _Dentist John Washington, collector of Lincoln memorabilia. For
more than 35 years he interviewed elderly blacks who had known
Lincoln or his aides and staff, and published it all in a book,
``They Knew Lincoln.''
   _Educator Anna Julia Cooper. Born into slavery, she taught high
school Latin for nearly 40 years. At age 67 she won a doctoral
degree from the Sorbonne, defending _ in French _ her dissertation,
``The Attitude of France in Regard to Slavery (American) During the
Revolution.'' She died at age 105 in 1964.
   _Mary Church Terrell. She is believed to be the first black to
serve on a school board in the United States. She served on
Washington's for 24 years and worked with Susan B. Anthony for
three decades in the women's suffrage movement. Her life ran the
span from the emancipation in 1863, the year of her birth, to the
Supreme Court's desegregation decision in 1954, the year she died.
   _Willis Richardson, who in the 1920s became the first black to
have a serious play produced on Broadway. For 43 years, he was a
clerk with the U.S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving.
   _Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux. A one-time fish peddler, he
founded the Temple of Freedom, Under God, Church of God, in a
storefront in 1928. Five years later, The Washington Post called
him ``the best-known colored man in the United States today''
because of his national Saturday morning ``Happy I Am'' broadcast
over CBS. In the Depression, his Happy News Cafe offered lunch for
a penny a plate. His mass baptisms at Griffith Stadium used
enormous canvas tanks and, on one occasion, water imported in
barrels from the River Jordan!
   ``Forced to overcome the barriers imposed by segregation and
discrimination, black Washingtonians molded a vital social and
economic culture within their carefully delineated neighborhoods,''
write the authors.
   ``This is, in essence, the silver lining to those difficult
years.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ An American reporter looking for inexpensive
accommodations in Japan checked into a Zen Buddhist temple with the
understanding that he would partake of the rituals. He learned what
it's like to get whacked by a monk. On the other side of the globe,
a former heroin addict has spent months in a Buddhist monastery in
New York's Catskill Mountains trying to kick his habit. Here are
two stories.

   The burly, black-robed Zen Buddhist monk
casually showed the wooden staff he uses to beat people who slump
or sleep during meditation.
   Only later, after it was applied to me with extreme vigor, did I
realize he was asking if it was all right to use it to improve my
meditating stance.
   We were in the Laymen's Zen Hall of Myoshinji temple. I had
asked a friend to help me find cheap accommodation in Kyoto, and
$13.33 for a night at Myoshinji seemed quite within reason.
   The only catch is that the guest must try to transcend reason
through Zen _and accept the discipline aimed at enlightenment.
   The monk, Kodo Yoshitomi, his bald head gleaming under the
ultraviolet lights in a large mat-covered room, explained the
basics of Zen meditation. He demonstrated the cross-legged lotus
position, with deep breathing and eyes focused on a point a yard
ahead. He told of chanting sutras and trying not to think.
   I said that not thinking is difficult. He laughed and agreed.
``This is very hard to explain to Mr. Foreigner,'' says Yoshitomi,
who is in his late 20s.
   He told me to sit on a round black pillow atop a 2-foot-square
cloth mat. After 15 minutes, a master monk and 12 mostly
middle-aged students, including a woman, came into the room and
assumed the lotus position on other pillows.
   Most of the students wore Western clothes, but a few wore robes.
The woman wore a coarse blue robe. One man was with his teen-age
son.
   We were lined up in two facing rows with the elderly master,
Kobun Harada, at the front of the room. The monks sounded a bell
and wooden clapper to signal the beginning of deep breathing, then
a triple bell to mark the start of meditation.
   Yoshitomi walked up and down the rows brandishing the staff. He
stopped in front of one student who had been slumping. The student,
still sitting, bowed and lifted his hands in a prayer gesture, then
leaned over with his left hand gripping his right shoulder.
   Tap, tap, whack! whack! The staff swung into the left upper back
of the student, who then put his right hand on his left shoulder.
Tap, tap, whack! whack!
   The student and Yoshitomi bowed to each other, and the monk
walked on down the row.
   I tried breathing deeply _ five seconds in, five seconds out _
focusing just ahead and trying to rid my mind of thoughts. The
primary thought was that my leg was falling asleep, aching and
becoming numb. Traffic noise made it hard to concentrate.
   Yoshitomi's soft footsteps grew closer. He stopped in front of
me. ``Glasses off,'' whispered student Sukuki Hiroshi, sitting
beside me. Yoshitomi pointed to my watch and I took that off too.
   I bowed down and the monk put my hand on the proper shoulder. A
couple of taps and the wood sliced through the air onto my upper
back with two tremendous whacks. I winced. Yoshitomi hit the other
side of my upper back twice, then put the staff against my spine
and pushed me against it to straighten me. We bowed and he moved on.
   After the initial sting wore off, I felt refreshed. The beatings
had gotten the circulation going again, and the idea of being
beaten made me want to laugh. I returned to trying to meditate with
renewed enthusiasm.
   I succeeded in not thinking for a few seconds at a time. But
then I'd think, ``Hey, it's working! I'm not thinking!'' and return
to the eternal internal jabbering.
   I thought about whether I would be beaten again, what we'd have
for breakfast, my wife and children, sleep, sex, and how to say
these things in Japanese.
   I thought about things I had read about Zen, including essays by
American Trappist monk Thomas Merton that sought to bring together
Buddhist and Christian contemplation. I felt inspired to learn more
about Zen, whose emphasis on simplicity, self-discipline and
oneness with nature is crucial to understanding Japan.

   But mostly I pondered the discomfort of the lotus position.
   One foot tingled, then ached, then grew so numb I couldn't move
my toes. I glanced down, thought I saw it turning blue, and
wondered if enlightenment was worth losing a foot.
   But every few minutes, especially when Yoshitomi crept by with
the staff, I made sure I was sitting upright.
   Finally the bell rang, the wooden clapper sounded four times and
everybody changed leg positions. The feeling was just returning to
my leg when we began another 20-minute round, during which a few
other students were whacked.
   The bell and clapper sounded again, and everyone stood up and
collected thin mattresses from a closet and spread them on the
floor in the sleeping room.
   We had a tea break at a table with Western chairs. The other
students were interested in my impressions of Japan and in the
variety of ethnic groups in the United States.
   Hiroshi said he had been studying Zen every weekend for a year
at the laymen's center, which has about 1,200 participants. Another
man said he had been coming for 10 years. No one indicated a desire
to become a full-time monk.
   I slept well despite the traffic, loud snoring from some
students and the lack of a shower.
   At 5 a.m. we were awakened and, carrying our pillows under
folded arms, we were led single-file along a street into the temple
compound and into the 660-year-old wooden temple.
   The dawn was bright, the air fresh and the temple grounds quiet
except for singing birds and the scrape of our temple-issue sandals
against gravel. I inhaled the aroma of ancient pines and felt this
was about as far East as one could get.
   We sat on our pillows on a tatami-mat platform, and two monks
sat by the altar under colored banners.
   We meditated for 20 minutes, during which most of us were
whacked, then began a series of chants. Most students had memorized
them, but some read from a pamphlet.
   The syncopated, low-pitched drone of the chants, accompanied by
a drum, was compelling and hypnotic. At the end they slowed down
and ended in a falling sound.
   After another 20-minute meditation, we walked briskly around the
temple's outer stone platform for about 10 minutes, then into
another building for a breakfast that defined austerity. We kneeled
on tatami mats around some low wooden benches, where Yoshitomi
explained the ritual for eating.
   We gave a chant of thanksgiving. Two other monks brought in a
tub of rice gruel and ladled it into our bowls after each person
bowed and scraped the palm in a brisk gesture.
   Each of us also had a little bowl of fried tofu with grated
radish and a small dish of pickles. We put a bite-sized offering of
gruel on the bench beyond the bowl, then ate quickly, shoving in
the wet gruel with chopsticks.
   Yoshitomi told us to save the last yellow pickle, which we used
with tea to wash out the bowls. We each put our single plum pit
into a bucket held by the monks, stacked the bowls and put them in
another bucket, then stacked the benches.
   Back at the laymen's center, we swept the tatami mats and
scrubbed them with rags. Then we sat on the mat in the sleeping
room for tea, cookies and an informal meeting. We introduced
ourselves and asked questions of Harada, the master, who seemed
kindly and easygoing.
   Afterward, Hiroshi gave me a ride to the mid-priced hotel where
I would spend the next night wallowing in the putrefaction of
relative luxury. But that didn't bother me, because I knew now that
it was all an illusion.

   Heroin addict Keith Scofield had three
choices: Go to jail, go to Colorado for drug treatment, or check
into a monastery.
   He chose the latter, Dai Bosatsu Zendo, a Buddhist monastery
sitting atop a mountain in the Catskills about 80 miles northwest
of New York City.
   Scofield is about a third of the way through a self-imposed
two-year sentence as a Zen novice, using 2,500-year-old meditation
techniques to relieve his craving for drugs.
   ``If I had gone back into drug treatment, I would have wound up
back in jail, or dead,'' says Scofield, 31, a heroin addict since
he was 13. Five previous drug programs had failed him.
   ``The reason I got lost into drugs is that I didn't care,'' he
adds.
   In Colorado, he would have spent two years in a boot camp-style
program, where, ``I would have been thinking, `Don't just shave my
head and have me scrub floors with a toothbrush. Give me something
new, something to be excited about.'''
   Scofield's foray into Buddhism began a year ago, when he was
sitting in Loudoun County Jail in Virginia. He was jailed in June
1989 after he was caught shoplifting, a violation of his 1988
probation for drug possession. That drug arrest came after he
overdosed on heroin.
   In his cell, Scofield began reading Zen manuals and meditating.
After five months, he went before a judge who gave him two options:
five years in prison or two years at the Colorado military camp.
Scofield, encouraged by the tranquillity he had found through
Buddhism, suggested a monastery as a third alternative.
   The judge agreed, with the understanding that if Scofield left
the monastery before his two years ended, or if he broke the monks'
rules, he would be jailed for five years.
   Last December, Scofield was freed and exiled himself to the
remote monastery, which can be reached only by a 20-mile trip up a
winding, narrow dirt road. His case was assigned to a New York
probation officer.
   Since then, Scofield's days have begun at 5 a.m., with a regimen
of chanting, meditation, manual labor, yoga and spartan vegetarian
meals.
   ``Some people thought I somehow scammed my way out of a prison
sentence,'' Scofield says. ``But if I had chosen jail, I could have
just sat tight, done my time and walked out.''
   He also could have been paroled in less than two years.
   Conventional drug treatment gave Scofield the rational reasons
to quit drugs, but no emotional or spiritual ones, he says. A year
was the longest he stayed off drugs after conventional treatment.
   The introspective searching of Zen philosophy fills that void,
he says.
   ``Drugs are a symptom. You've got to come to a deeper
realization of the truth,'' says monastery vice abbot Junpo Dennis
Kelly.
   Kelly, who was reluctant to let Scofield come to the monastery,
now gives 2-to-1 odds that Buddhism will help him overcome his
addiction.
   ``At first I said, `He's a junkie, and junkies break down,'''
Kelly says. ``You've got to be desperate to come here, because this
is spiritual graduate school. But Keith's been a very, very good
student.''
   Kelly says his own background as an LSD manufacturer and user
makes him sympathetic to Scofield. Kelly spent a year in federal
prison in the 1980s for drug trafficking.
   Scofield could be a pioneer for the monastery, which may take in
more criminal drug users. That would have been unthinkable two
years ago, says abbot Eido Roshi, who founded the traditional
Japanese monastery in 1976. But the monastery is ``Americanizing''
itself, blending Zen spiritual tradition with Western worldliness.
   Drug rehabilitation experts say they had never heard of anyone
trying to overcome addiction at a monastery, but conceded that
different addicts need different handling.
   ``Recovery is a journey for anyone who is addicted, and people
take different paths in their recovery,'' says Jane Fedderly,
spokeswoman for the Hazeldon Rehabilitation Center in Center City,
Minn.
   ``The name of the game is recovery. I wouldn't knock what he's
doing.''
   Scofield's well-ordered 16-hour days are at least as taxing as
the boot camp that awaited him in Colorado, he says. And monastic
life is far more strenuous than life in prison or a conventional
drug program.
   Yet he's approaching his new life with zeal. The day begins with
group chanting before the monastery's carved wooden Buddha. After
breakfast, Scofield works chopping wood, painting, repairing walls
and ceilings.
   Four hours of meditation are spread throughout the day, the
longest period coming before the lights go out at 9 p.m.
   ``I really got lucky,'' Scofield says. ``I didn't know what sort
of place this would turn out to be. I remember thinking, what if
it's an old barn with 20 monks sitting in a circle chanting. But
then I thought, it really doesn't matter as long as I change my
life. What I had before wasn't really much of a life.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Garage sales, people unloading the unwanted,
have developed into a multimillion-dollar industry. No one has a
good handle on the scope of the nation's driveway economy, but
there's a whole lot of secondhand retailing going on.

   Comedian Phyllis Diller used to cruise garage
sales searching for treasures among trash.
   ``I bought eight guitars at a St. Louis garage sale once,'' she
says. ``At that same sale, I bought a blonde wig and I used that as
my fright wig in all my shows. Boy, it's ugly.''
   Diller and people like her support nation's driveway economy, in
which millions of dollars change hands every season.
   Summer's here and so are garage, tag, rummage and yard sales.
Call them what you want. They're put on by people who want to
unload the unwanted.
   Take a look at the classified section of this newspaper. Chances
are you'll find a separate listing just for garage sales. Thursday
is a big day for newspaper ads since the sales frequently run
Friday through Sunday.
   There's a whole lot of retailing going on.
   Just ask Chris Stevenson, author of ``Garage Sale Mania: How to
Hold a Profitable Garage, Yard or Tag Sale.''
   ``There is so much money in this just for a weekend,'' he said
from Huntington Beach, Calif. ``It's a multimillion-dollar
business.''
   Getting an accurate fix on garage-sale revenue is impossible.
   In Michigan, for example, the state Treasury and Commerce
Department doesn't track money changing hands at the sales. All
those dusty bicycles, flower vases and sets of three matching
glasses aren't subject to state sales tax since they're used items
and not sold in a licensed business.
   To help get an idea of how much money passes through these
private flea markets, look at Livonia, a bedroom community of about
105,000 people west of Detroit.
   Last year, Livonia issued 2,792 garage sale permits at a buck
apiece. Forgetting that some sales escaped the permit process, that
works out to .03 garage sales per person, per year.
   Now for the money. The fuzz factor gets kind of heavy here but
Stevenson says a typical garage sale nets about $100.
   That means that garage sales shoppers in Michigan fork over
about $28 million a year for other people's junk. That's slightly
more than the annual budget for the entire state park system.
   Take that nationwide, and the driveway economy adds up to about
$720 million annually.
   Where there's money, there's a whole lot of advice on how to
deal with it, including some from Diller.
   A few years ago, she made a videotape called ``How to Have a
Moneymaking Garage Sale.'' It's just now being distributed.
   ``I realized that people were not being efficient,'' she said
from Chesaning, Mich., where she was appearing in a play. ``They're
good for the environment because you don't throw it away or bury
it.''
   Some tips from her video:
   _Check with your insurance company.
   _Plan on one-tenth of the original price for clothes and
one-fifth for working appliances.
   _For security, never publish a phone number in advertisements.
   The latest edition of ``Books in Print'' lists four titles
beginning with the words ``Garage Sale,'' including Stevenson's.
   Stevenson says weapons are hot sellers. ``We bought some rifles
for $39.95 and re-varnished the stocks and blued the barrels and
sold them for $69.95,'' he says.
   Tools and tool chests, exercise equipment and clothing also do
well. Stevenson says mattresses and box springs are losers, as are
jigsaw puzzles, which often are incomplete.
   Inventory arrangement can help at the cash box. Sometimes it's
beneficial to arrange male- and female-oriented items on separate
tables with gender-neutral items such as luggage in between.
   Stevenson also has some strategies for people who are serious
about becoming garage sale barons like him. Stevenson's
brother-in-law got him hooked on other people's castoffs.
   ``We learned how to run around and buy out other garage sales in
a `bid-out,''' he says. ``We would take the total inventory of a
sale for a set price. Usually we would do this early in the morning.
   ``If they refused us, we would hit them early in the afternoon
and see if they would take our price, usually lower than in the
morning.''
   The deals usually were accepted.
   Garage sale prowlers usually fit into one of four general
categories.
   _The Idly Curious. Fair-weather shoppers, usually traveling in
couples, who fork over a dime here or a quarter there. Big spenders
they're not.
   _The Jokesters. The next time you get a gag gift at a birthday
party or a family get-together, it probably was picked up at a
garage sale by one of these characters. Some considerable money,
maybe $5 or so, can be involved in a transaction.
   _The True Bargain-Hunters. These are a seller's dream.
Frequently these are people with REAL money, looking for bicycles
or big-ticket baby stuff such as cribs, swings or high chairs.
Sometimes they're hunting for true moneymakers such as washing
machines and dryers.
   _The Hard-Core Garage Sale Prowler. The bane of all hosts. These
solo shoppers come armed with large bags for little stuff. They'll
quibble over a nickel on a 15-cent, one-time family heirloom,
unconcerned or oblivious that they're asking for a 33-percent
discount.
   Making money despite deep discounts may be the second-most
important factor in evaluating the success of a garage sale.
   ``It's not the money,'' one garage sale host says. ``It's the
cubic yards removed.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Carnegie Hall, once doomed to destruction,
celebrates its 100th birthday this season. Thank Isaac Stern, the
virtuoso violinist who has been president of the New York concert
hall for the past 30 years. Rarely has a musician been so closely
associated with a place.

   To Isaac Stern, Carnegie Hall is a mystical
place, the Mount Olympus of American music. For good reason.
   The storied New York concert hall is where Stern first vaulted
into preeminence as a virtuoso violinist. He returned the favor
years later by saving Carnegie Hall from oblivion.
   That was 30 years ago. Today, as Carnegie Hall prepares to
celebrate its 100th birthday, Stern reflects on its rich history as
the cradle of American culture in the 20th century.
   ``Carnegie Hall is entwined completely with the artistic,
emotional, intellectual, political growth of this country,'' Stern
says. ``It's astonishing.''
   Carnegie Hall, he adds, ``was the place where you came to prove
whether you belonged or not. It has been the crown proving place
for every single orchestra, every conductor, every pianist, singer,
violinist, cellist.
   ``You walk in there, you think of all the people who've been
there. It's the center from which the entire development of
American music came. Nothing happened in this country that didn't
come through Carnegie.''
   As a performer, the violinist says, ``Carnegie Hall makes a
performance larger than life. It's an enormously powerful hall and
it does give even average performers a glamour and power they
wouldn't have in other halls.''
   With its coming 1990-1991 ``blockbuster season,'' Carnegie Hall
celebrates its 100th anniversary. Stern, who celebrated his 70th
birthday on July 21, says, ``The important thing is to make sure
it'll be here for the next 100 years.
   ``It's something to hold on to, some connection with man's
involvement with education, with the quality of civilization.''
   As for his own birthday, he says, ``I very honestly feel as if
I'm reaching a good time of my middle age. Of course I'd be a
little more sure of it if I knew very active people who were 140.''
   At a birthday celebration concert in San Francisco, actor
Gregory Peck called Stern ``an irresistible one-man cultural
force.''
   Surely no virtuoso instrumentalist has been as allied with a
place as Stern with Carnegie. He'd played in New York twice at Town
Hall, receiving mild notices, before performing at Carnegie for the
first time, at age 22, in January 1943. Reviews glowed.
   ``That was the start of the career, really,'' he says. ``From
then on, things really took off.''
   At home in Manhattan, wearing a short-sleeved shirt on a
90-degree day, his glasses pushed atop his white hair, Stern agrees
to pose for a picture holding his Guarneri violin. But he doesn't
follow the photographer's suggestion to hug the instrument with
crossed arms.
   ``Unlike a woman, you embrace a violin with great care, not with
great abandon,'' he explains. ``It's more like a baby.''
   Stern muses that 1943 in Carnegie Hall saw the start of ``the
Leonard Bernstein era,'' when the young assistant conductor of the
New York Philharmonic substituted on short notice for the ailing
Bruno Walter.
   It was the year the Duke Ellington Band played ``Black, Brown
and Beige,'' starting Ellington's annual Carnegie concerts,
premiering his extended compositions which often expressed racial
pride.
   Stern recalls some of the historic concerts he attended at
Carnegie: the great return of pianist Vladimir Horowitz after his
absence, the American debut of Soviet violinist David Oistrakh, the
last performances of violinist Fritz Kreisler.
   ``It was clear Kreisler was going to go into retirement at that
time. I remember particularly his last orchestral concert. Eugene
Ormandy wrapped him in musical cotton to take care of him during
that whole performance. It was moving. Touching. Very dear.''
   He remembers the time pianist Arthur Rubinstein gave 10 recitals
in a row, all of them for charity, Marian Anderson's farewell,
Eleanor Roosevelt coming to listen to a high school graduation
performance.
   In 1960, when Lincoln Center was being built and the New York
Philharmonic about to move from Carnegie to the new Philharmonic
Hall in the new music and theater complex, the plan was to tear
down the privately owned Carnegie Hall and build an office tower.
Starting with meetings in friends' apartments, Stern began raising
money to mount a campaign to save the hall.
   Did he really think he could save it or was he making a symbolic
gesture?
   ``I never was a Don Quixote,'' Stern says. ``I don't tilt at
empty windmills. I was completely convinced I was going to win. If
I had been less innocent I might have been afraid of how possible
it was to lose.
   ``I wasn't entirely innocent politically. I knew I had to work
politically.
   ``After we knew we had won the fight and they were drafting the
legislation that let the city buy Carnegie Hall, I left as a member
of a group to do a tour. While we were in Europe they voted me in
as president of Carnegie. I haven't quit yet.''
   Being president of Carnegie Hall for 30 years has taken more
time than most concert performers would be willing to sacrifice
from their musical careers. He hasn't minded, Stern says, ``because
the violin gave me the impetus and power to work for Carnegie and
that gave me a different set of tensions to make going back to the
violin even more pleasurable.''
   Stern has long worked to help fledgling musicians.
   ``Being of service has always seemed very natural to me. I can't
give you a reason. I never thought of it as being of service.
People have been very nice to me. I've been very fortunate. A long
time ago, without being philosophical or creating a credo, I just
figured one has been fortunate so one has to give something back.
You don't just take. So I do that.
   ``I'm interested to tell young people why you play, what happens
between the notes where the music is made, and to teach teachers
how to get excited about how music is part of our lives.''
   A movie, ``From Mao to Mozart,'' in which Stern shares music
with youngsters in China, won an Oscar for best full-length
documentary in 1981.
   Stern and his wife, Vera, have two sons who are conductors, one
married to a violinist, the other engaged to an oboist. Their
daughter and her husband, who have three sons, are both rabbis,
with synagogues 12 miles apart in New Jersey.
   ``Vera and the children have helped me always,'' Stern says.
``We're a very close family. We believe in loving and touching and
that's a help.''

   Don't be surprised if Jane Curtin loses
control occasionally in her role as a divorced mother in the NBC
fall show ``Working It Out.''
   In the pilot for the new Saturday night comedy, which co-stars
Stephen Collins, she had wanted to show that she was not reprising
her Emmy-winning role from ``Kate &amp; Allie.''
   ``It was important for me to show that she was very different
from Allie, that she had everything under control,'' she says.
``But the pilot seemed to be too one-note. She was too much in
control.
   ``In the future we'll show that beneath that she's lava _ liquid
rock. You'll see her control crumble from time to time. It makes
her more human.''
   Curtin stars as Sarah Marshall, the divorced mother of a
9-year-old. She isn't looking for any new relationships until she
meets David Stuart (Collins) at a cooking class. Stuart is a
photographer who has finally gotten his own daughter out of the
house and isn't interested in anyone with a young child. Of course,
that all goes out the window as they start ``working it out.''
   Curtin's last regular character, Allie, had considerably less
control of her life. Curtin co-starred with Susan Saint James for
five years in ``Kate &amp; Allie.'' Allie was a homebody, with two
children, who preferred standing over a hot stove to dating. She
was a great cook, who could never get a grip on things, although in
the final season in 1988 she got married.
   This fall, NBC has all half-hour comedies on Saturday, including
three new shows. ``Parenthood,'' based on the hit movie, begins the
night, followed by ``Working It Out,'' the returning hit shows
``The Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest'' and ``Carol &amp; Co.,'' and
another new comedy, ``American Dreamer.''
   CBS counters with a mixture of comedy, drama and news, while ABC
has three one-hour dramas, including ``Twin Peaks'' at 10 p.m.
   ``Working It Out,'' like ``Kate &amp; Allie'' and ``Saturday Night
Live,'' is produced in New York. Other than a few movies, Curtin
has worked mostly in New York to be near her husband and daughter.
She talked about the show during a brief visit to Los Angeles to
promote the series.
   ``I was looking for a project and was in contact with Bill
Persky,'' she said. Persky had been the executive producer of
``Kate &amp; Allie.'' ``He was doing a film, and I thought I should go
off and do something different. Then at the last minute we felt we
should do something together. He sent me a pilot script he had
written, and many lunches and calories later we decided to go with
it. Billy didn't write it for me, and originally he only wanted me
to look at it. But I liked it and wanted to work with Billy again.
   ``If you have the same rhythm as Billy and I do, it's the best
condition for working. You just fly through. He's very open to
suggestions. You never feel inhibited.''
   Prior to ``Working It Out,'' Curtin had spent some time
developing a comedy news show with Buck Henry and others.
   ``It would have been like one of those pontifical round-table
shows,'' she says. ``We kept trying to get something on as a
segment of the Connie Chung show. It didn't work out. That was last
November, and every time we did anything the events changed.''
   Curtin had been an anchor on Weekend Update on ``Saturday Night
Live'' after the departure of Chevy Chase.
   She had been with The Proposition, an improvisational theater
group, before joining ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1975 as an
original member of the Not Ready For Prime Time Players.
   ``The Proposition would occasionally perform on television,''
she says. ``Usually after each performance we'd never be invited
back because we'd manage to offend them in some way.''
   Curtin reportedly said on leaving ``Saturday Night Live'' that
she would never return. Asked if she would ever return for a guest
role, she flashes a grin and replies, ``If it were on earlier. Say
9 or 9:30 p.m.''
   She left the late-night show in 1980 and went on to continued
television stardom. She won two Emmys for her role in ``Kate &amp;
Allie.'' She did not achieve the feature film success of such SNL
alums as Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, and later Billy
Crystal, Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy.
   One of her first movies was ``How To Beat the High Cost of
Living,'' which went nowhere. The movie, however, did team her for
the first time with Susan Saint James, which may have figured in
their pairing later in ``Kate &amp; Allie.'' Garrett Morris, also from
``Saturday Night Live,'' was also in the movie, as was Dabney
Coleman, her co-star in the TV movie ``Maybe Baby.'' She starred
with Tom Selleck in ``Divorce Wars.''
   This past season she played Alice McGoff, a widow with seven
children who fought school integration in Boston in the miniseries
``Common Ground.'' That was the first blue-collar role for Curtin
and a change of pace.
   ``It's so hard to hide good breeding,'' she jokes. ``It's a
curse.''

   Don't look for one-shot guest stars at the
Guthrie Theater. No television personalities and movie names
brought in for marquee value or to give the box office a boost.
   The Guthrie is a company of actors _ 23 at last count _ who have
made a nearly year-round commitment to the regional theater and its
artistic director Garland Wright.
   That was one of the reasons Wright took the job in the summer of
1986. It was a chance to build a permanent troupe of performers
able to jump from Shakespeare to Shaw, from Wilde to Wilder with
ease.
   The classical company's current challenging efforts are good
examples of giving actors and audiences a stretch. Three
Shakespeare history plays _ ``Richard II,'' ``Henry IV'' and
``Henry V'' _ are being performed in repertory all summer.
   ``The emphasis in doing these plays was the acting company,''
says Charles Newell, who co-directed the trio of Shakespeare epics
with Wright. ``The plays were chosen with the company in mind. We
didn't go to New York to get the leads and then cast the secondary
parts locally, which has been the case in the past.''
   Casting from New York or Los Angeles or Chicago is common
practice among a lot of regional theaters. Most performers can't
afford a steady diet of regional theater work.
   ``When actors work mainly on a free-lance basis, they can do a
soap opera for maybe 10 weeks at $3,000 a week and then do a play
at a regional theater for $300 a week,'' says Edward Martenson, the
Guthrie's executive director.
   ``In other words, the commercial side of their existence is
subsidizing the art side,'' he says. ``It's a question of at what
level can actors afford to give up that commercial side in order to
do what they'd like to do.''
   The Guthrie, which has a yearly operating budget of about $9.5
million, has tried to snare actors with two promises most
performers can't resist _ good roles and more money.
   The money is linked to an ambitious $25 million endowment plan,
which was started in the spring of 1987 and which Martenson hopes
to have closed out by the end of 1991. So far, more than $16
million has been raised, much of it in large gifts from
corporations and donations from several individuals.
   ``Our reasoning was that we could not hope to compete with the
resources they have in Hollywood or on Broadway in terms of a
weekly salary,'' Martenson says. ``Instead, what we're looking for
is the ability of an actor or actress to settle here and make a
full-time commitment.''
   One actress who has done just that is Brenda Wehle, who plays
small roles in ``Henry IV'' and ``Henry V'' and will have a major
part in ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' and the title role in ``Medea''
when they open later in the season.
   Wehle first came to Minneapolis five years ago for five months
with a production of Eric Overmyer's ``On the Verge,'' directed by
Wright. She was living in Philadelphia at the time and going where
she had to _ places such as Hartford, Conn., and Seattle _ for
acting jobs.
   ``Garland called seven months later when I was back in
Philadelphia, and he said, `Can you be here in two weeks for longer
than five months?''' she recalls. ``I moved out, bought a house
with a white picket fence, bought a car _all the dreams you have _
put my two children in school and began as a member of the new
company four seasons ago.''
   Charles Janasz, who plays Richard II, Ned Poins in ``Henry IV''
and the Dauphin in ``Henry V,'' arrived at the Guthrie last year.
He had been in a similar acting company at Arena Stage in
Washington and loved it.
   He also had tried New York and found he had to go out-of-town to
get work.
   ``Unless you're dead set on making a career move into film and
television, I see no reason for not moving here unless you like
instability,'' he says. ``I'm happy when I'm working, and I'm not
happy when I'm not working. So when I was living in New York, the
only time I was happy was when I was away from home.''
   Other actors in the company came from as far away as across
town, local actors Wright has pulled into his troupe. Stephen
Yoakam, who plays Bolingbroke in ``Richard II'' and later the title
character in ``Henry IV,'' went to college in Minneapolis and, for
the most part, stayed.
   In 1986, the Guthrie had only six actors under contract for a
year. But the most any actor could earn then in a full season at
the Guthrie was $24,000, Martenson says.
   ``On that, you can't buy a house, settle down and have a
family,'' he says. ``Our objective was to get to an average of $950
a week, which would work out, for a 45-week season, to a little
more than $42,000 a year. That would put our highest salary at
something like $50,000 for a full-time actor. On that, we feel
people can afford to make a full-time commitment to us.''
   Those levels haven't been reached yet.
   ``We've still got two steps to go, phased in over a period of
six years,'' Martenson says. ``But the progress that we've made so
far and the commitments that we've gotten from people make it clear
that the money increase has been a very significant factor.''
   The variety and quality of the roles offered these actors have
been just as important in compelling them to stay at the Guthrie.
   ``There's been a steady upward climb in terms of the size of the
roles we've been undertaking and the responsibility that has been
given to us as members of an ensemble,'' Yoakam says.

   ``Blue Steel'' (MGM@UA Home Video. VSH-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   ``Blue Steel,'' the story of a rookie cop in New York City who
unwittingly falls in love with a crazed killer, might better be
titled ``Aww! Come On!'' after the chorus of incredulous groans it
provokes.
   Viewing this movie is an exercise in good faith gone bad, with
scene after unbelievable scene that would force even the most
gullible to get annoyed.
   ``Blue Steel'' revolves around Megan Turner, played by an ever
locked-jawed Jamie Lee Curtis, in her quest to become a top cop and
maybe even get a date once in awhile.
   But in one of her first nights on the beat she blows away a
grocery store robber in vicious fashion _ emptying a whole round
into the guy. Since the robber's gun can't be found, Megan is
suspended and told to give her trigger-happy fingers a rest.
   Enter the embodiment of seductive evil, Eugene Hunt (Ron
Silver), who witnessed the shooting and suddenly realizes Megan is
a kindred killer spirit.
   Hunt, a wealthy commodities broker, is the kind of smooth
operator who takes his dates out to ritzy restaurants and then up
for helicopter rides around Manhattan's glittery night skyline.
   He wins over the lonely Megan without telling her he saw the
robbery and when he's not seducing the lady cop, he's out randomly
killing people on the streets of New York. To declare his love for
Megan, he scratches her name in the bullets.
   This brings Megan back on duty, working with a team of homicide
detectives who are trying to figure out why the killer is so
obsessed with her.
   What follows is a series of implausible plot developments _ the
crack homicide team essentially lets the rookie Megan run the
investigation; Hunt, a prime suspect, is never given so much as a
powderburn test to determine if he's involved in the spate of
murders; and at one point Megan, severely dazed and in shock, is
back on the streets to hunt down the killer.
   Aww! Come on!
   To its credit, ``Blue Steel'' does have a number of
``boogie-man-in-the- closet'' type thrills _ short bursts of
cheaply orchestrated terror. And Silver does a fine job playing the
psychotic devil in an Italian suit. His blood lust is so well done
he somehow seems to revert to a primal, evil animal state.
   But in addition to the plot problems, the dialogue is often slow
and insipid. Here's an exchange after Megan handcuffs her partner
to a car's steering wheel so she can run after the killer by
herself: ``I almost got you killed,'' Megan says. ``Yeah, that you
did,'' her partner responds, adding, ``you get some rest.''
   Aww! Come on!

   ``Lineage'' (Blue Note) _ Benny Green
   
   Jazz pianist Benny Green is just 27, but he demonstrates a
veteran's appreciation and feel for classic jazz and bebop in his
first solo title album, ``Lineage.'' Green plays strong and spunky
on every selection chosen for this compact disc, from Bobby
Timmons' ``Dat Dere'' to Monk's ``Ask Me Now.''
   He also stretches his talents from fusion to show tunes. He has
included a wonderfully syrupy version of Lerner and Lowe's ``If
Ever I Would Leave You,'' and adds a light fusion number of his own
called ``Trust,'' although his other three compositions steer
closer to classic jazz.
   Green, who has played with Frank Morgan, Betty Carter and
Freddie Hubbard, is backed solidly by bassist Ray Drummond and
Victor Lewis on drums. But the album is clearly Green's chance to
shine. The selection and order of numbers flow smoothly, making for
an impresive first album by an ascending new talent.

   Oh well, one might say, here are a couple more war horses by a
middle-rank orchestra and ambitious conductor. One might also be
very much mistaken, because this is a stunning recording.
   Lopez-Cobos draws out fresh-sounding, vivid and supple
performances with beautifully shaped lines and tight rhythmic
control. The orchestra glows and the winds play superbly. A worthy

   Masses No. 2 and 6, by Franz Schubert (Telarc) _ Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus, conducted by Robert Shaw (Telarc)
   
   Shaw conducts detailed, nicely phrased and well-balanced _ if a
little bland _ performances of a good sampling of Schubert's sacred
music on this compact disc, generously timed at 77:45. Schubert
wrote No. 2 at the age of 17, and it is quite a bit simpler than
No. 6, which was composed in the final year of his pathetically
short life.
   The contrast is interesting. In fact, the straight-forward
innocence of the earlier work makes it more appealing. The soloists
are generally admirable, particularly soprano Dawn Upshaw in No. 2

   ``Blazing Away'' (Island Records) _ Marianne Faithfull
   
   This mostly live offering by one of rock's legendary survivors
carries a warning label about its lyrics but ought to caution
listeners to beware its emotional punch.
   Twelve of the 13 songs were recorded during two 1989 concerts in
a Brooklyn, N.Y., cathedral. In effect, the collection is a musical
autobiography of Faithfull, who burst onto the pop scene as a
teen-ager in the 1960s, faded away in a heroin haze in the 1970s
and returned in the '80s with the critically acclaimed but
hard-to-enjoy album ``Broken English.''
   I bought ``Broken English'' in 1981, and gave it away not long
after, unable to bear the ragged voice that once had sung so
sweetly on ``As Tears Go By.''
   Faithfull sings ``As Tears Go By'' on ``Blazing Away'' and it is
beautiful. Her voice is still harsh but the ache in it feels real
and the spare arrangement, featuring an accordion solo by Garth
Hudson, gently colors the melancholy mood.
   The album also contains powerfully moving readings of John
Lennon's ``Working Class Hero,'' and the Rolling Stones' ``Sister
Morphine,'' a song for which Faithfull wrote the lyrics during her
long-ago union with Mick Jagger.
   Another highlight is the ``Ballad of Lucy Jordan,'' a song of
middle-age madness by Shel Silverstein that Faithfull has made one
of her signature tunes.
   Her band on the live numbers boasts, in addition to Hudson, New
Orleans piano king Dr. John and guitarist Marc Ribot, who also has
played on recent Tom Waits and Elvis Costello recordings.
   But despite the fine sound and Faithfull's evocative vocals,
she's still a difficult act to enjoy. Many of her best songs are
downers and the timbre of her voice reveals as much about pain and
hard times as the lyrics.
   There are rewards here, but only for listeners willing to open
their minds and drop their preconceptions.

<HEAD>Star Watch: How ``Becket'' Launched a Star</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Julia Roberts was 16, she saw the movie
``Becket,'' the Richard Burton-Peter O'Toole masterpiece about the
stormy relationship between King Henry II and Archbishop Thomas
Becket, and her future was instantly determined.
   ``That movie had a more profound effect on me than any I had
ever seen,'' she remembers. ``To see performances like the ones
Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole deliver, it made me want to be
that wonderful _ or, at least really try.
   ``It set a kind of standard somewhere in the back of my mind,
and it was something that in my lifetime I hoped I'd get a moment
to achieve. That's real absolute greatness. If I could do that for
a second, I'd be a real happy actor.''
   At 23, she has come a long way toward achieving that goal,
faster than even she had hoped. Amid the gaggle of superstars in
``Steel Magnolias,'' only Roberts was nominated for an Academy
Award. Next came ``Pretty Woman,'' as a Hollywood hooker to Richard
Gere's takeover tycoon. The movie astounded everyone with a $160
million gross, and still counting.
   She has a new film coming in August. In ``Flatliners,'' Kiefer
Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Roberts are medical
students who try to probe the afterlife by stopping their vital
signs. It's a thriller that scared even the actress. ``It gets the
heart pumping.''
   So does Robert's beauty. With her long auburn hair, Raphael-like
face, wide mouth and all-knowing eyes, she is a stunner, off-screen
and on. Add to the look a languorous voice shadowed by her youth in
Smyrna, Ga. It's no wonder that she has climbed into the $1
million-per-picture category. ``Pretty Woman'' has no doubt raised
the ante.
   She scoffs at claims she is an overnight sensation.
   ``It's kind of interesting how they can make five years seem
like a long weekend,'' she said. ``It was a road traveled. It
wasn't quick, although it came in a way I never anticipated. But I
also never predicted the outcome of what I was attempting to do. I
just delighted in the opportunities to keep doing it. That's where
the real excitement comes from: every time you get a job, you think
you get another chance to show something.''
   Roberts' career as an actress was determined long before she saw
``Becket.'' Both her parents were actors. Her brother, Eric
Roberts, preceded her into films and won an Academy Award
nomination for ``Runaway Train.'' Julia admits that she might have
enrolled at the University of Georgia, gotten married and become a
housewife if she hadn't left Smyrna for New York after high school.
   She attended acting classes and endless auditions before landing
her first role at 18 in a ``Crime Story'' segment. After a few
low-budget films, she tried out for ``Mystic Pizza.'' The role
called for a Portuguese waitress, so she dyed her hair black. She
got the role.
   She terms ``Mystic Pizza'' a ``nice surprise.''
   ``None of us on that movie had really done very much. It was a
chance to show somebody something.''
   Producer Ray Stark liked what he saw. He planted Julia amid the
high-powered women of ``Steel Magnolias'': Sally Field, Shirley
MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis. The anticipated battle of
temperments never developed.
   ``They were all so available, loving, supportive, giving,
tremendously caring women,'' Roberts said. ``I had such an
immediate rapport that I never really got a chance to think how
scary this might have been or should have been, really. It was just
very familiar from the start.
   ``I never expected the nomination. It's a nice moment where
they're saying to you, `We accept you; when you're saying you're an
actor, we believe you; we trust that you can do what you say you
can do.' That's a momentous honor.''
   As to the smash success of ``Pretty Woman,'' Robert said, ``I
don't ever look for the results of a piece of work. When I'm
working, that's what I'm doing that particular day: trying to make
that work within the structure of the piece. I don't take a movie
thinking that it's going to end up doing this particular amount of
sales or that people will accept it in a certain way.
   ``You can never know. That's the unpredictable, the reason all
kinds of movies are made. If there was a formula for the kind of
movies people would go to see, that's the only kind that would be
made. I don't dwell on something you can't figure out.''
   ``Flatliners'' proposes the theory that another experience
exists post-mortem. Roberts goes along with it:
   ``I think there is. How could it all just turn black? I don't
believe that will happen. Something's there.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Restoration Sparks Hope Among Conservators</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The restoration of an abandoned
shopping mall to its turn-of-the-century elegance has sparked hopes
that other aging architectural gems may be preserved rather than
knocked down or allowed to crumble.
   Galerias Pacifico covers an entire city block along the Florida
Street pedestrian walkway that cuts through the heart of Buenos
Aires' commercial district.
   Modeled on Vittorio Emanuele II gallery in Milan, it was a
showpiece from its marble halls to glass roof when it opened 100
years ago.
   ``I remember going there when I was a girl. It was marvelous,
wonderful,'' said Nene Martinez Castro, director of Casa F.O.A., a
group that redecorates interesting buildings and sells admission
tickets to raise money for charity.
   ``As an adult, I thought it was a glory, and then a shame when
it went to waste,'' she said.
   Galerias Pacifico received a facelift of sorts in the 1940s.
Huge frescoes by some of Argentina's most gifted painters _
Spilimbergo, Urruchua, Berni _ were added as decoration around a
central dome. But the glass roof was covered by an arch of
reinforced concrete.
   The building eventually was taken over by the state, which tried
beginning a decade ago to sell it. Services deteriorated, and
discouraged tenants left one by one.
   In recent years, Galerias Pacifico _ whose well-kept neighbors
include the Plaza Hotel, Harrods Department Store and the
glittering Naval Officers Club _ became an eyesore of broken
windows, sagging marquees and boarded-up entrances.
   It was home no longer to boutiques for leather, fur, toys and
books, but to pigeons, rats and decrepit men and women with no
other place to call their own.
   This capital city of 10 million has a lot of buildings that date
back to when beef and grain exports made Argentina one of the
richest countries in the world, and money was lavished on homes,
offices, plazas and boulevards.
   Retiro train station, inaugurated in 1915, was inspired by
London's Victoria Station. The facade of La Prensa, once the
biggest newspaper in Latin America, recalls the Paris Opera.
   Many buildings boast Art Deco touches such as columns molded in
the shape of giants who appear to sustain the structures on
shoulders and backs of bulging muscle.
   Others have towering lobbies of Italian marble, stairways of
German oak, elevators with wrought iron grillwork and wooden
benches, interior patios with statues and fountains, windows big
enough to stand in, balconies, turrets, gables, cupolas.
   The central hall of the National Library is lined by bookcases
of polished wood that stretch up several stories to a dome that
allows in enough light to read by.
   Such buildings ``add to a city's culture, a city's affluence ...
its spirit,'' said architect Elizabeth Kries. ``I'm not against new
things ... but there are some buildings that have values you should
not lose.''
   While pleasing to the eye, such buildings often are drafty,
awkward to organize and deficient in plumbing, heating, air
conditioning and access for the handicapped.
   The library, train station and La Prensa are in advanced states
of deterioration. When owners of other buildings were faced with
finally doing something, many concluded in the 1960s and '70s that
it was easier to tear down than remodel.
   ``Everyone believed modern was better,'' Kries said. ``The
United States put a man on the moon. ... People saw old buildings
as old things, old ideas. They didn't appreciate them.''
   Such thinking has begun to change.
   Casa F.O.A. last year redesigned an abandoned textile factory
into spacious loft apartments that helped start a trend. Plans are
afoot to do the same with warehouses along Buenos Aires' decaying
waterfront.
   Another group converted a derelict central market into an
open-air theater whose first production was Federico Garcia Lorca's
``Bodas de Sangre'' (``Blood Wedding'').
   When it bought the Alzaga Unzue Palace in downtown Buenos Aires
several years ago, the Hyatt corporation reportedly intended to
demolish the 76-year-old mansion. Now, company officials plan to
use it as a lobby for what will be a five-star hotel.
   Jose Maria Pena, director of the City Museum and a conservator
who helped draft zoning laws to protect old buildings, said it's
too soon to say if all that amounts to a trend.
   ``In general, builders still think it's easier to take down a
building and put up something new.'' he said.
   But Pena added, ``There are a lot of examples of restorations
and ... there is a trend of people wanting to live in old buildings
that have more space and privacy.''
   And buildings that look a little more distinguished.
   ``A majority of buildings built in the 1960s and '70s ... have
prematurely aged,'' said Pena. ``They look more worn out than
buildings built at the turn of the century that wear their age with
dignity.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Sean Penn's Big Brother</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH HARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Penn carries the heaviest of show
business burdens _ family connections.
   And when one of your relatives has a reputation as a hotheaded
bully, the load of expectations doesn't get much lighter.
   The older brother of actors Sean and Christopher Penn has caught
the public's attention with his debut album ``March,'' a collection
of songs about failed relationships set to a folksy sound that has
been compared to the Beatles.
   At 30, Penn knows a thing or two about failure. He's now coming
into his own after 12 years of trying to land a record deal.
   After graduating from Santa Monica High School, Penn spent seven
years kicking around the Los Angeles club scene with a band called
Doll Congress. At the same time, his former sister-in-law, Madonna,
was becoming the pop sensation of the 1980s.
   ``I know that I may be possibly too patient of a person. We kept
getting so close to getting a deal where labels were interested and
giving us money to go into the studio. It never happened, and yet
we still stayed together because it was enough of an encouragement
to keep plugging away,'' he said.
   ``I think it was when I came to the realization that I was not
completely happy with the way things were going that it finally
broke up.''
   Penn departed the band in 1987 and took keyboardist Patrick
Warren with him. The pair met when Warren answered a newspaper
advertisement placed by Penn.
   ``Patrick showed up to audition with a keyboard that didn't
work, and so the audition was basically us just talking,'' he said.
   Their collaboration peaked in Penn's four-track home studio,
where he wrote the songs that eventually would end up on ``March.''
He turned the results over to his manager, who brought the tape to
the attention of RCA.
   ``Unlike every other time where there was like a lot of
anticipation around a tape, this time I just sort of said, `Here's
some new stuff. I'm going to go back and work on some more stuff,
do with it what you will.' In a couple of weeks, we started to get
phone calls,'' he said, unfolding a tobacco-filled bandana to roll
cigarettes.
   ``No Myth,'' the album's first single, rose to No. 13 on the
charts, and the video received major exposure on Music Television.
Two other singles, ``This and That'' and ``Brave New World,'' have
received extensive airplay.
   ``I sort of smiled the most about the fact that it popped its
head into all different formats. There were people in all these
little camps that responded to it, which I thought was kind of
cool,'' said Penn, whose casual attire of a tank top, blue jeans
and cowboy boots kept him out of a restaurant's dining room during
a recent dinner.
   The album's title doesn't have anything to do with the month of
March either.
   ``It was a realization while making the record that I have this
subconscious tendency to write marches. I'm not sure why, but a lot
of the beats on the record just felt like a march beat,'' he said.
   ``I think there's a lot of humor in the album. It's not
something I really think about; it's just the way the songs come
out. Certain lines make me laugh.''
   Penn managed to keep his sense of humor during the 12 years he
waited for his big break. ``I was fully prepared to keep working
the day jobs that were going nowhere to house and feed me to keep
making music.''
   One of his worst jobs was as a customer service representative
for a photography company that specialized in shooting debutante
balls.
   ``My job was answering phones and talking to the parents of
these debutantes down South who were telling me the photographs
didn't look like their daughters _ she wasn't that overweight or
whatever,'' he recalled with a chuckle.
   Eventually, he was fired. ``What got to my boss was my creative
working hours. I kind of wandered in a little after the first
coffee break.''
   Despite his resemblance to Sean, it's the family name that
brings up the comparisons and inevitable jokes about his brother.
   Instead of getting mad, though, Penn admits to a perverse
pleasure in seeing the frustration of reporters who want to fuss
about his bloodlines.
   ``What's been interesting to me is that a lot of the press gets
frazzled by the fact that they couldn't make an issue out of it.
The fact that it wasn't an issue became the issue they wrote about
because they had to find some way to include it,'' he said.
   Even David Letterman couldn't resist. Penn sat down to chat in
his second appearance on the show and immediately got zinged.
   ``So, how old were you when Sean threw his first punch?''
Letterman teased as Penn managed a half-smile.
   ``Letterman knew it was just a stupid comment and that's kind of
his job,'' he said.
   Penn says his family has rallied together in the face of a
hostile celebrity press and public. His father, Leo, is a veteran
television director and his mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress.
   ``I don't think you can be Irish, Italian and Jewish without
being a close family,'' he said.
   He hasn't ruled out the possibility of having his father direct
him in a video. And his youngest brother is singing, too.
   ``Lately, Christopher has been doing a lot of blues singing,
which is actually kind of cool. He's got a great whiskey voice, and
he's pretty good at it.''
   While the rest of the family was acting, Penn was busy
practicing guitar licks in the garage with his first band in junior
high.
   ``I knew I wanted to do music when I was 8 years old. The songs
are the things that appeal to me most about music,'' he said,
alternating a bite of curried chicken with a drag on another
cigarette.
   ``That's what I did as a kid. I never got into sports or
anything else. I just bought records and played guitar,'' he said.
   ``I'm actually glad that I didn't get signed until I was 29. If
I had to live with a legacy of records of the music I was writing
when I was in my early 20s, I would probably get embarrassed.''
   Penn began the summer as Tears for Fears' opening act in a tour
of outdoor venues. This month, he'll wrap up the club tour with
Lloyd Cole that brought him to Indianapolis.
   He's got half the songs written for his next album, and he and
Warren might head out on an acoustic tour in October. His biggest
exposure yet may come this fall at a music festival in the Baltic
republic of Estonia.
   ``The whole thing has basically taken me by surprise. I just
kind of felt lucky to have gotten a deal. I just really wanted it
to sell enough so I could make another one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: John Edgar Wideman Sees MOVE as Metaphor</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Forget the fire,'' a character says in
John Edgar Wideman's new novel. ``Play with fire you know what
happens. You'll get burnt like the rest of us.''
   Wideman, not known for sticking to safe topics, can't forget the
1985 MOVE confrontation that killed 11 people and destroyed a
Philadelphia neighborhood.
   ``I don't think it's something that should be put to rest,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his home in Amherst, Mass. ``I
think it should be kept alive, and used creatively, no more than
the Holocaust should be put to rest.''
   The acclaimed author of ``Brothers and Keepers'' and ``Sent for
You Yesterday'' makes his case in ``Philadelphia Fire,'' scheduled
for September release by Henry Holt.
   The MOVE confrontation becomes a complex metaphor for black
America, urban decay, love, power and justice. In the
unconventional, earthy narrative, Wideman alludes to the slave
trade, Shakespeare's Caliban, the birth of the blues and the
drumbeat call of a basketball game in a West Philadelphia park.
   The book's central character searches for a survivor of the
fire, but finds a reflection of himself instead. The narrator's son
is in prison, as is Wideman's, though the author said the account
is not strictly autobiographical.
   ``All these characters merge,'' he said. ``They flow in and
out.''
   Wideman and his wife, Judy, lived during the late 1960s on Osage
Avenue, two miles from where the MOVE radicals later spent a year
harassing their middle-class black neighbors and broadcasting
obscenities and calls for revolution from a public address system
day and night.
   The narrator of ``Philadelphia Fire'' registers shock when he
learns police bombed the radicals' fortified row house May 13,
1985, and let a neighborhood burn in a bungled eviction attempt.
   The narrator thinks he's looking at a war zone or ``a Third
World shantytown where there's no water, no machines to extinguish
a fire,'' when the scene erupts on television.
   Wideman felt similar shock when he learned of the conflagration,
he said in the interview. He had played basketball with people in
the neighborhood and wondered how the crisis evolved.
   ``Something in a way had been done to me,'' he said. ``Something
had been done to my past. As I learned more about the MOVE people,
I recalled also that if I didn't know those particular people, I
knew people like them. People who were around me. People who had
been dropouts, who had been radicals in the '60s. People who had
given up on the system in the '60s, black and white.''
   At the same time, he said, he shared the feelings of people who
had been subjected to abuse by MOVE members. ``I have great
sympathy and understanding of them, because that's more or less the
kind of world I come from,'' he said. ``They're my people.''
   The fact that Philadelphia had a black mayor, W. Wilson Goode,
made the story more complex, he said.
   ``That's another factor in the whole situation that made it
worth writing about, worth attempting to get to the core of,'' he
said. ``First of all, it was a little confusing, another source of
anger. `How could he do that? How could one of us do that to us?'
That was my immediate response, my visceral response. It became
clear as I learned more and more that the mayor was in a sense a
victim like everybody else.''
   In the fictional account, there is just one survivor instead of
two. And the leader of a ``family'' similar to MOVE is called King,
not John Africa.
   Cudjoe, the central character, returns to his native
Philadelphia from Greece to search for the survivor, a boy named
Simba. In an exchange with Margaret Jones, a former follower of
King, he explains he wants to write a book about the fire, its
cause and meaning.
   ``Don't need a book,'' she says. ``Anybody wants to know what it
means, bring them through here. Tell them these bombed streets used
to be full of people's homes. Tell them babies' bones mixed up in
this ash they smell.''
   Cudjoe's response: ``I want to do something about the silence.''
   Wideman said in the interview he believes people have tried to
forget MOVE out of fear. He recalled a Quaker memorial service he
attended to which the mayor, governor, president, police and others
had been invited.
   No officials showed up and just a handful of ``the convinced,''
he said.
   ``For it to be buried that way means that nobody really could
understand the application, what's at stake,'' he said.
``Everybody's individuality and hope for any kind of decent life is
at stake. All citizens of Philadelphia. Because if MOVE can be
wiped out today, who tomorrow?''
   The MOVE confrontation offers a special historical insight,
Wideman said.
   ``It's not an isolated event,'' he said. ``To me, it's the
culmination of the '60s. It's our society's, our culture's answer
to the question, `What do you do with people who are different?'''
   When the mainstream is confronted by something as different as
MOVE, democracy is tested, he said.
   ``MOVE people were in lots of ways (part of the) '60s,
alienated, turning away from the system, reacting against excesses
of big business, corporations, governments. But this was 20 years
later. ... So what do you do with them? Well, smash them, murder
them, because there was no room for the option that they hold.''
   The story also concerns fathers and sons, a topic of poignancy
for Wideman whose brother, Robert, and son, Jacob, are in prison
for murder. The narrator meditates on a legal system that he says
allows his son to rot in confinement without treatment for mental
illness.
   Wideman declined to answer questions about Jacob. The victim's
parents have sued the author for damages. Jacob also has confessed
to a separate murder in Wyoming.
   But ``Philadelphia Fire'' suggests the anguish Wideman has felt
as it describes the difficulty of telephone conversations between a
father and his imprisoned son.
   ``I've learned the hard way that I've always known next to
nothing about him,'' the narrator says. ``Except I do know the
danger of the place where he's incarcerated, the depth of the
trouble he's in, the innocence and terror and guilt he must cope
with day after day and little on the horizon but more of same.''
   The narrator later says, ``A child lost cancels the natural
order, the circle is broken.''

   Billy Joe Royal marvels that he can
still sing his hit record ``Down in the Boondocks'' in the same key
as he did in 1965.
   ``Some other singers who've been around as long as me have
dropped down a step,'' Royal says.
   Royal was a rock 'n' roll star in the 1960s with such hits as
``Down in the Boondocks,'' ``I Knew You When,'' ``Cherry Hill
Park'' and ``Hush.''
   He kept singing through the '70s and '80s and had recording
contracts much of the time. And now that the 45-year-old is going
into his fourth decade behind the mike, he has established a solid
career in country music and even recently received his first gold
record.
   ``I was stubborn,'' he says. ``I just thought I had something
left to say. Plus, I thought there was a place for me in country
music.''
   In the past five years, his country hits include ``Love Has No
Right,'' ``Burned Like a Rocket,'' ``I'll Pin a Note on Your
Pillow,'' ``It Keeps Right on a Hurtin''' and this summer's
``Searchin' for Some Kind of Clue.''
   His first gold album, for sales of 500,000, was ``The Royal
Treatment.''
   ``In my era, in the '60s, if you sold 50,000-100,000 albums that
was a big album,'' Royal said reflectively in his Music Row office.
``This album was a milestone for me.''
   His recent resurgence marks a remarkable comeback after a lean
period in the late '70s and early '80s. Although he continued to
sing, he was away from the national limelight and at times was
reduced to performing in hotel lounges.
   ``You're sitting in a lounge just a few years after singing at
the Greek Theater,'' he recalled. ``You wonder what happened.''
   His explanation is that ``records became group oriented, then
acid rock came along. I didn't understand all that.''
   He sang in enough lounges and clubs to pay his bills at home in
Marietta, Ga., and periodically visit Nashville looking for a
decent recording contract.
   ``I used to stay at a motel (outside of town) because it was
just $20 a day and I could make my money last longer,'' Royal said.
``I could have picked up the phone and got work, but the level I
was on ...''
   He finally signed with Atlantic Records, the fourth major label
of his career, and moved comfortably into the country music market.
``It's not something foreign to me,'' he said. ``I knew as much
about country as anything.''
   One key to his recent success has been four top-rated music
videos _ a part of the music business unheard of in his earlier
performing years.
   ``It means a lot to put a face with the music,'' Royal said.
``And people saw that I wasn't 112 now, using a walker.''
   These days he's on concert bookings with country kings such as
George Strait and Alabama. In the 1960s, he was a member of Dick
Clark's Cavalcade of Stars, appearing with acts such as Herman's
Hermits and Paul Revere and the Raiders.
   ``I felt like a fan on the bus,'' he said, reminiscing about his
first months as a rock 'n' roll star. ``It all happened in six
weeks' time.''
   The centerpiece was ``Down in the Boondocks,'' a song still
heard on oldies radio stations and to this day the closing song at
his concerts. It's about a poor young man in love with a rich girl.
   ``I guess people related to poor people,'' he said about the
tune's appeal. ``Plus the sound of it was different. We cut it on a
three-track machine _ the most primitive thing in the world. How it
sounded like a record, I don't know.
   ``Once in a while I hear it on the radio, and it still stands
up. The song meant everything to my career. I was making about $125
a week before that.''
   Royal, a native of Valdosta, Ga., doesn't listen much to rock
'n' roll music anymore. But he did like the recent hit songs ``The
Living Years'' by Mike &plus; the Mechanics and ``Talk It Over'' by
Grayson Hugh.
   ``I listen to country stations and oldies stations and some
gospel stations,'' he said.
   In view of his recent success, he says he plans to keep plugging
away on stage and on record. Five decades is within reach.
   ``They are going to have to carry me off. As long as somebody
shows up, I'll be there.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Unbelieveable Truth'' and ``Flatliners''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds new new material in review for ``The Unbelievable
Truth'' following 11th graf, ``The film is...,'' to add rating and
producer. ``The Unbelieveable Truth'' has opened in New York and
opens in 10 additional cities on Aug. 3 adding others through the
month; ``Flatliners'' opens Aug. 10</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Unbelieveable Truth'' _
   ``The Unbelieveable Truth,'' made for a whopping $200,000, is a
relative bargain in this summer of million-dollar adventures. It's
a debut film, irreverent and unpredictable, but less self-assured
when it tries to get serious.
   The movie was written and directed by Hal Hartley, who graduated
from the film school of the State University of New York at
Purchase in 1984, and is a pretty irreverent sort himself: He
raised some of the money by telling the bank he was buying a word
processor. The actors are all virtually new to film, and shooting _
on location at Lindenhurst, Long Island _ took just 11{ days.
   Josh Hutton (Robert Burke) is released from prison after serving
time _ we're told _ for raping and killing a girl and then killing
her father. Dressed in black, the soft-spoken Josh is continously
mistaken for a priest and must admit, instead, that he's merely a
mechanic, and a prison mechanic at that.
   When Josh isn't working on cars, he's discussing life with Mike,
a fellow mechanic, heavy metal guitarist and self-styled
philosopher. ``You start cleaning yourself a lot better,'' Mike
says about what happens to a man when he has a girlfriend.
``Suddenly, you're buying underwear up the whazoo.''
   Audry Hugo (Adrienne Shelly) is a doe-eyed high school senior
who spends much of her free time thinking about nuclear war. Her
parents want her to go to college but the way Audry sees it,
``We'll all be lucky to be alive in September.''
   Josh and Audry meet after Audry's father gives him a job at his
local garage; Josh may be a mass murderer but he's the only who
knows how to fix a foreign car. Audry has dumped her nerdy
boyfriend after he greets her one morning in a jacket and tie, and
she is immediately attracted to Josh.
   There are, of course, other complications. Audry's father
(Christopher Cooke) objects to the relationship, offering Josh a
raise in return for leaving her alone. And Audry, unable to get
Josh to sleep with her, leaves Lindenhurst to pursue a modeling
career.
   Hartley shows a nice touch for deadpan humor, and as black
comedy, the film works. Cooke is especially funny, ranting and
fuming like a stressed-out Ward Cleaver, ready with a parental
cliche for all occasions. The director also takes full advantage of
the low budget, even switching from one scene to the next by
showing a flash card that reads, ``Meanwhile.''
   But Audry's reflections on nuclear war wear thin and Hartley's
message about ``emotional capitalism,'' the way relationships are
conducted like business, seems forced.
   The film is simply too detached to make anyone really worry
about the characters' achieving emotional truth. After all, they'll
be lucky to be alive in September.
   ``The Unbelievable Truth'' was produced by Hartley and Bruce
Weiss, with Jerome Brownstein as executive producer. The film is
rated R for language and adult situations.

   ``Flatliners'' _
   No, ``Flatliners'' is not a movie about pioneer farmers
scrabbling for a living on the limitless Midwest plains. The flat
line referred to in the title is that oscillograph, much used in
hospital scenes, that indicates vital signs. When the line goes
flat, the lights are out.
   Kiefer Sutherland is an ambitious medical student obsessed with
learning what lies beyond the flat line. ``Philosophy failed,
religion failed, now it's up to physical science,'' he propounds.
   Sutherland's messianic zeal wins over three fellow students:
Julia Roberts, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt. A more reluctant
Kevin Bacon agrees to go along. In an abandoned part of the
university hospital, they rig up a lab Dr. Frankenstein wished he'd
had.
   Starting with Sutherland they wander into the twilight zone.
What they discover is not the stairway to paradise, but scary
reminders of their past transgressions. The demons pursue them
after their return to life.
   In less able hands, ``Flatliners'' might be an overwrought
exercise in science fiction. Thanks to Joel Schumacher's astute
direction and ingenious production design, the film is a
heart-grabber.
   Schumacher (``Cousins'') has an expert feel for the macabre, and
he makes good use of the vitality of his young cast. Rarely has the
look of a film proved so important. Eugenio Zanetti has created a
world where sunlight rarely enters. The gothic murals and sculpture
of the crumbling hospital, full of skulls and death masks, provide
the perfect backdrop for the bizarre goings-on.
   Peter Filardi's script is brilliantly inventive, even if logic
flies out with ghosts of things past. James Newton Brown's music
contributes inestimably to the somber mood.
   Although Kiefer Sutherland is the dominant figure, the five
leading roles are almost equal. Julia Roberts is not merely a
pretty woman but a convincing actress as well. Kevin Bacon asserts
his rightful position as a character actor of real strength. As the
girl-chasing charmer, William Baldwin exhibits the star quality of
his brother, Alec. Rotund Oliver Platt has the best lines as the
wry conscience of the reckless quintet.
   The Columbia picture was produced by Michael Douglas and Rick
Bieber. Rated R for language and scariness. Running time: 111
minutes.

<HEAD>Report Says Shanghai Stock Market to Open in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's first full-fledged stock market since the
Communist takeover will open in Shanghai in December, a newspaper
report said Monday.
   The port city will begin operating a national securities
exchange in a new building equipped with computer terminals linked
to trading counters inside the city and around the country,
Shanghai's official Liberation Daily reported.
   Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, during a recent visit to the United
States, told the Los Angeles Times that the new exchange would
first concentrate on government securities and later develop
trading in shares of Shanghai companies.
   He said the city planned to lift a ban on foreign purchases of
shares ``very soon'' and to allow foreign-owned banks, which now
are restricted to settling foreign currency accounts, to handle
deposits and loans.
   Shanghai, which had one of Asia's largest stock exchanges before
the 1949 Communist takeover, opened a small stock trading counter
in 1989 for cash purchases and sales as well as resales of
government bonds.
   The exchange, which is capitalized at 50 million yuan, or $10.6
million, remains small because most shares rest with enterprises
and securities houses that rarely trade their holdings.

   The stock market declined broadly today in
selling attributed to worries about weakness in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 17.57 points to
2,880.94 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 246 up, 710
down and 468 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.34 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were still unsettled by Friday's report
that the gross national product grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year.
   The increase was smaller than expected, and reflected a buildup
in inventories rather than gains in final demand among consumers
and business purchasers.
   That was taken as an inauspicious sign for production and
corporate profits in the months ahead.
   Brokers said that gave investors little incentive to buy stocks,
especially given the tendency of individual issues to sell off
sharply of late in any instance of disappointing earnings.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down } at 110|; General Electric, down { at 71{;
McDonald's, down { at 31\, and Boeing, down 1&lsqb; at 58&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .96 to 192.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.44 at 354.05.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.28 to
2,898.51, extending its loss for the week to 62.63 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 531 up, 923 down and 527 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 149.07 million shares, against 155.04
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Number of Working Rigs Plunges by 26</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States dropped by 26 this week to 996, according to a
widely-watched index of drilling activity released Monday.
   Baker Hughes Inc., the oil toolmaker, said that despite the
plunge, the figures remained well above the 870 working rigs a year
ago. Last week, the number of working rigs was 1,022, up 21 from
the previous week.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The company has kept track of the rig count since 1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Louisiana posted the largest
decline, losing 10 rigs for the week. Other states reporting losses
were Oklahoma, down nine; Wyoming, down seven; Pennsylvania and
Kansas, which each lost three; and New Mexico and North Dakota,
each of which lost one rig.
   Of states reporting gains for the week, Colorado had the largest
increase, adding five rigs. Among other states with gains, Michigan
jumped by three rigs; California added two and Ohio increased by
one rig.
   The number of rigs in Texas remained unchanged for the week.

   Consumer spending jumped 1.0 percent in June,
the largest gain in five months, while personal incomes rose 0.4
percent, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.64 trillion after being
unchanged in May. It was the biggest advance since a similar 1.0
percent increase in January.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   Spending has been weak in recent months. The Commerce Department
reported earlier this month that retail sales rose 0.5 percent in
June, the first increase since last January. The department
reported last week that personal spending fell 0.3 percent during
the three months ending June 30.
   Personal income totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$4.63 trillion following identical 0.3 percent gains in April and
May.
   Americans' savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable
income _ fell to 4.9 percent. It had been 5.4 percent in May and
5.1 percent in April.
   A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital
since funds thus would be available domestically for business
investment.
   The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.5
percent, up from 0.3 percent a month earlier.
   The key component of the income category _ wages and salaries _
rose $13.0 billion after a $10.1 billion increase in May.
   On the spending side, the increase in personal consumption,
which includes everything except interest payments on debt, rose
$34.5 billion, including $9.6 billion for durable goods expected to
last more than three years.
   It was the first increase in durable goods spending since
January. A Commerce Department spokesman said automobile sales
accounted for a large share of the gain.
   Non-durable goods spending rose $8.2 billion for the first
advance since February, while spending for services advanced $16.7
billion, the largest jump since a $20.4 billion increase in March.

   Near-term soybean futures were slightly higher
while grain futures were a little lower in early trading today on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The soybean market was rebounding modestly after last week's
sharp decline. But analysts said the week's weather outlook for the
Midwest _ mild temperatures and above-average rainfall _ remained
bearish for soybean and corn prices.
   The National Weather Service's 30- and 90-day outlooks, which
were issued Friday, also predicted favorable weather for Midwestern
crop development.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., traced some of
the support in the soybean futures to high soybean prices at Gulf
of Mexico delivery points.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.97{ a bushel;
corn was { cent to 1} cents lower with September at $2.61 a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1} cents lower with September at $1.29 a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with August
at $5.86 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .07 cent higher with August
at 77.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .10
cent higher with August at 89.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .58 cent higher with August at 60.02 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .58 cent to 1.83 cents higher with August
at 50.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

<HEAD>Bank Withdraws From UAL Buyout: Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 11th graf, ``Greenwald declined ... with 5 new grafs to

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp., one of five banks that
expressed interest in financing the $4.38 billion employee buyout
of UAL Corp., has opted out of the deal for now, a newspaper
reported today.
   The bank's withdrawal less than two weeks before a deadline to
secure financing for the deal was described as temporary and
subject to change, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources
it did not identify.
   UAL is the parent of United Airlines.
   Ken Herz, a Chemical spokesman in New York, would neither
confirm nor deny the report when reached by telephone this morning.
``We just don't comment on deals that are in negotiation,'' he said.
   Hank Krakowski, spokesman for United Employees Acquisition Corp.
_ the entity formed by United's unions to handle the buyout _ also
declined comment.
   The group has until Aug. 9 to secure financing.
   Earlier this month Chemical and four other New York-based banks
_ Citicorp, Chase Manhatten Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. _ expressed interest in becoming the
lead lenders for the deal.
   The banks had been expected to offer about $500 million each, or
a total of $2.5 billion.
   The unions need more than $4 billion to complete the cash
portion of the $201-per-share buyout, refinance existing debt and
provide working capital for the airline.
   Gerald Greenwald, who would become United's chairman if the
buyout is completed, told the Journal the group is close to
agreement to obtain additional debt financing from some of United's
aircraft and engine suppliers.
   Greenwald declined to comment on Chemical Banking's reported
withdrawal, but told the Journal the financing talks likely ``will
go all the way to the wire.''
   Steven Matthews, a spokesman for Greenwald, would not confirm
nor deny the report about Chemical Banking when reached this
morning at his New York office.
   Matthews said a number of issues remain to be resolved before
the Aug. 9 deadline, but he predicted the deal would be completed
in time.
   ``Not only are we trying to work them out, but we're trying to
work them out under a very tight deadline,'' Matthews said.
   ``We have not requested an extension'' of the deadline, he said.
The deadline was set in the merger agreement the unions signed with
UAL's board of directors in April.
   The lack of extra equity investment so far was one of the
reasons for Chemical's decision, the newspaper said, citing a
source it did not identify.

   Control Data Corp., said Monday it has
completed the sale of its Printed Circuits Operation for an
undisclosed price.
   The business is being sold to Acsist Associates Inc., a
privately held company whose principal shareholders are Carl V.
Reynolds, former manager of manufacturing technology and operations
at ETA Systems, a Control Data subsidiary that was shut down last
year, and Frank H. Voigt, former partner in the Dorsey and Whitney
law firm in Minneapolis.
   Acsist Associates will continue to supply Control Data's
requirements for complex printed circuit boards, Control Data said.
It also will market its products and services to commercial and
military customers with certain needs.
   Reynolds said the operation will remain in its St. Louis Park
location and all 128 employees will be employed by Acsist
Associates.
   Control Data said the Printed Circuits Operation had revenues of
$11 million in 1989.
   Control Data provides data solutions that integrate hardware,
software, and services to meet customers' data collection,
processing and communications needs.

   Stock prices took another drop today in selling
attributed to worries about weakness in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 62.63 points last
week, fell 16.33 to 2,882.18 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 409 up, 911

   Analysts said traders were still unsettled by Friday's report
that the gross national product grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year.
   The increase was smaller than expected, and reflected a buildup
in inventories rather than gains in final demand among consumers
and business purchasers.
   That was taken as an inauspicious sign for production and
corporate profits in the months ahead.
   Brokers said that gave investors little incentive to buy stocks,
especially given the tendency of individual issues to sell off
sharply of late in any instance of disappointing earnings.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business

   The ceremonial first Saturn automobile
was driven off the Spring Hill assembly line today by Roger Smith,
the retiring chairman of General Motors Corp., the automaker
announced.
   In a ceremony that was closed to the news media, Smith drove the
car off the line at 10:57 a.m. local time, accompanied in the
metallic red, four-door ``Job One'' sedan by Owen Bieber, president
of the United Auto Workers union.
   Smith, whose retires Tuesday, was followed in ``Job Two'' by
incoming GM Chairman Robert Stempel.
   They were joined by GM executive vice president Lloyd E. Reuss
and UAW Region 8 Director George H. Smith, plus Saturn President
Richard G. LeFauve.
   ``Today's milestone signals both the determination and
enthusiasm of Saturn team members to achieve our mission _ to
market a high value, world-class quality car which will compete in
the small car market against the best of the Japanese
competition,'' LeFauve said.
   ``Production is coming on line, retail facilities are under
construction, and we can't wait to get to the marketplace this
fall,'' he said.
   He said the ceremony was private because of Saturn's plans to
focus national attention on the car's launch this fall. He said it
also provided a chance for team members to talk with Smith.
   The public in October will get its first authorized look at the
Saturn line, GM's first new nameplate since Chevrolet joined up in
1917.
   GM has tried to cloak the Saturn project in secrecy since its
inception eight years ago. Pictures and details about the Saturn
project have leaked, prompting GM to offer a reward at one point
for information about the leaks.
   Smith introduced the project in 1983 as a boxlike subcompact car
that would sell for $6,000 to $8,000. GM planned to challenge
Japanese imports with a peppy, 60-mpg small car. Early plans called
for a production capacity of 500,000 cars a year.
   Today's Saturn has more interior room, a longer wheel base and
more features. It now is aimed to compete with the Honda Civic and
Toyota Corolla _ with a $10,000 to $12,000 price tag and a smaller
35-mpg rating.
   Saturn employees call themselves ``team members,'' a reminder of
the new labor-management system at the sprawling plant 35 miles
south of Nashville.
   Production workers operate under a separate contract from that
being negotiated by the UAW and the Big Three automakers.
   Only 120,000 cars a year will be built at first, with a peak
production level of 240,000 a year.
   Saturn now is producing three models _ the two-door 2&plus;2, a basic
four-door and a more expensive four-door _ but could expand the
lineup in the future. LeFauve said.

<HEAD>Layoffs, First-Half Losses For French Computer Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French computer firm Groupe Bull SA announced
Monday plans to cut 3,000 jobs during 1990 and said losses for the
first six months this year were three times larger than in the same
period in 1989.
   The troubled computer maker said in a statement it would lay off
3,000 workers to streamline manufacturing and research operations
in North America, Ireland and France.
   The state-owned company predicted earlier this year that only
1,200 layoffs would be necessary.
   Bull said losses from January through June 1990 totaled 1.88
billion francs, or $355 million, up from a loss of 537 million
francs in the first half of 1989.
   The latest loss stemmed in part from Bull's acquisition of the
data-processing units of Zenith Electronic Corp. last year, the
company said.
   Consolidated revenue rose to 15.9 billion francs, or $2.8
billion, in the first half from 14.0 billion francs in the same
period in 1989.
   Bull's loss comes amid a general downturn among
mainframe-computer makers. Standardization has cut demand for
costly proprietary systems and has sliced profit margins for
companies that haven't adapted.
   The French concern said earlier this year that it planned to cut
1,200 jobs from its work force to cope with the slowdown and
changes in the industry.
   Bull said sales picked up in June after declining for five
straight months and noted it normally earns about 60 percent of its
revenue in the second half of the year.
   The company posted a loss of 267 million francs in 1989,
following a profit of 303 million francs the previous year.

   Otis Elevator Co. has signed an
agreement with a Soviet company to make, install and maintain
elevator equipment in the Soviet Union, the company said Monday.
   ``This agreement strengthens Otis' leadership position in the
elevator industry worldwide by establishing a partnership in the
important Soviet market,'' Otis President Karl Krapek said in a
statement.
   The Soviet company, Shcherbinka Lift Plant, is a unit of
Liftmash, the national agency responsible for making elevators. The
new company will be called Shcherbinka Otis Lift. Otis, the world's
largest elevator company, will own 55 percent and Shcherbinka 45
percent.
   A new facility is being built at the existing Shcherbinka Lift
Plant near Moscow to produce elevator equipment for offices and
small hotels for the Soviet domestic market. Otis will provide
manufacturing equipment, management personnel and training for
Soviet workers.
   ``This joint venture, which was organized with the active
involvement of Liftmash, will give Otis a manufacturing presence in
the Soviet Union, enabling us to participate more fully in this
large and growing market,'' said Pierre Fougeron, president of Otis
European and Transcontinental Operations.
   Otis is a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.,
which is based in Hartford.

   The professor was very hungry for a hamburger,
but then, as sometimes happens to professors, he reached into his
pocket and found no money. He would have to do without.
   He didn't think it was fair. Just a few minutes before, he had
paid for a doctor's visit with a credit card, receiving in return a
bill marked ``paid in full.'' His health insurance company would
reimburse him.
   He mused: ``If I had hamburger insurance I would not have this
problem. I could have had my hamburger, already eaten it, without a
dime in my pocket.'' He thought the idea had promise. ``Everyone
eats hamburgers,'' he thought.
   And so, with tongue in the cheek where he had hoped to have a
hamburger, he devised a plan to allow all Americans in need of a
patty to have one. Free and open access to hamburgers! ``A rather
basic right,'' he mused.
   The professor, an economist named William Dunkelberg, who also
is dean of the School of Business and Management at Temple
University in Philadelphia, decided to explore the idea. It might
relieve his craving.
   ``The plan is simple,'' he explained. ``It would work like all
the other insurance programs: We just add up total burger
expenditures, divide by the number of people and arrive at an
average premium.''
   Any individual who paid this premium, perhaps $40 a year, would
receive a wallet-size Hamburger Insurance Card. The money would go
into a Hamburger Insurance Trust, which would repay the burger
joint.
   As he drove back to the office, the notion grew. He saw millions
of people signing up, and multimillions of dollars pouring into the
Hamburger Trust. It would be a whopping success.
   Then the bills arrived from the hamburger providers, and it was
very clear that the bills exceeded the insurance premiums collected.
   ``How could this be?'' asked Trust officials. ``We charged each
person the average amount spent on hamburgers in the United States,
plus $5 for overhead expenses, such as maintaining our respectable
but by no means posh offices.''
   Congress established the Hamburger Commission to investigate and
report. It found people who didn't eat hamburgers didn't sign up
for the program. Thus, revenues were less than projected.
   The commission recommended that Congress make hamburger
insurance mandatory so that no one could escape responsibility for
funding such important coverage. Some commission members thought
this was not enough.
   Why? Because those who originally signed up for the program
bought even more hamburgers than they had before they had the
insurance. These heavy eaters not only were buying more hamburgers
but more expensive ones as well.
   A number of beneficiaries were using the insurance card to buy
burgers for their pets. And drive-through customers were ordering
an extra burger for the road, in case they got hungry. They could
always throw it away.
   Producers innovated too. Triple deckers became the norm, and
burgers made of ground filet were especially popular as business
lunches and among the tennis and garden club set. At higher prices,
of course, and delivery extra.
   The Hamburger Trust was endangered. Without insurance, many
people would be unable to afford hamburgers. Business people warned
that a failure of the Trust would destroy jobs and force small
companies out of business.
   It was decided that a tax subsidy was needed to save the
program. ``No one,'' declared an heroic cattle-state senator,
``should escape responsibility for maintaining this American
institution.''
   Premiums were raised and made mandatory. Taxes were raised too,
reducing consumer disposable income and making people more reliant
on the hamburger program for basic food.
   The impact was immediate. More expensive hamburgers were
introduced. More companies entered the business, and they offered
more ``services,'' fully covered by premiums. Fewer people ate at
home; they couldn't afford to.
   The federal budget deficit grew, and it was urgently suggested
by some throwbacks to another time that the program be curtailed to
save the economy. Not a chance. It was an election year.
   At that point the professor dropped the idea as a very dangerous
one. The idea, he confessed, had lost its appeal, quite a contrast
to his original pride in thinking it up.
   He had lost his taste for a hamburger. ``Forget it,'' he said,
swallowing his pride instead.

   Defense and steel contractor LTV Corp. reported
Monday a 153 percent jump in second-quarter net earnings, mainly
because of the sale of an interest in a company and special charges
a year ago.
   The Dallas-based company, which is operating under bankruptcy
court supervision, reported net income in the quarter ended June 30
was $76.6 million, or 59 cents per share, compared with $30.3
million, or 18 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue
declined from $1.66 billion to $1.59 billion.
   The company said the 1990 quarter included a $44.3 million gain
from the sale of its stock in a maker of stainless steel. The
year-ago quarter was reduced by a $30 million special charge on the
writedown of costs on a facility for manufacturing advanced
aircraft compounds.
   For the first half of the year, LTV reported net income of
$120.8 million or 81 cents a share, compared with $106.9 million or
73 cents last year. Revenues fell from $3.28 billion last year to
$3.08 billion this year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Confidence in the nation's economy among
consumers was about the same in July as in June, according to a
monthly private study released Tuesday.
   Consumers were slightly more positive about present conditions
than in June but a little less positive about their expectations
for the months ahead, the Conference Board reported.
   The conclusions were based on a monthly survey of 5,000
households nationwide conducted by the Board of Family Opinion Inc.
in Toledo, Ohio.
   ``Consumer confidence has been losing ground since the beginning
of the year, but the experience has been markedly different in
various regions of the country,'' said Fabian Linden, executive
director of the board's consumer research center.
   Linden said confidence was sharply lower in New England in the
second quarter of 1990 compared with the same period a year earlier.
   Expectations in the Middle Atlantic states also were lower,
while consumer confidence was up in the west central and mountain
regions. Confidence was lower in the Pacific states than a year ago
but above the level in the rest of the nation.
   Of those surveyed, 23.2 percent said business conditions were
good in July, up from 22.6 percent the previous month, and 25.6
percent said jobs were plentiful, up from 23.4 percent in June.
   But more respondents _ 11.7 percent in July compared with 10.4
percent in June _ said they expected business conditions to worsen
in the next six months. Also, 17.9 percent said they expected there
would be fewer jobs available in the next six months, up from 16.5
percent in June.
   Buying plans were mixed. Eight percent said they planned to buy
a car and 4.3 percent a home in the next six months, both up from
June. But overall plans to purchase major appliances declined to
26.8 percent from 28.8 percent in June.
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit business research
organization.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. on Monday reported a net loss of
more than $747 million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ending April 30, due largely to a $639.3 million reorganization and
restructuring charge.
   The Phoenix-based convenience store chain said its losses for
the fiscal year came to $772.9 million or $17.91 per share,
compared with earnings of $15.4 million or 20 cents a share for the
previous year.
   Fourth-quarter revenues were $907.9 million, compared with $932
million in the same period a year earlier, when the company lost
$23 million.
   The loss for the fourth quarter amounted to $17.19 per share,
compared to a loss of 57 cents a share in the 1989 period.
   Circle K filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code on May 15, eight days after the resignation
of Karl Eller as the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Eller had taken charge of the company in 1983. Under his
control, it grew from 1,000 stores to the nation's second-largest
convenience store chain, with more than 4,600 stores in 32 states,
and almost 1,300 stores under license or joint venture agreements
in 14 foreign countries.
   The company also had more than $1.5 billion in debt.
   A Cincinnati lawyer, Bart A. Brown Jr., was named in late June
to succeed Eller, while Robert Dearth Jr., also of Cincinnati, had
been named president in January.
   Dearth had been vice president and chief administrative officer
of United Brands Co., which is controlled by Cincinnati investor
Carl Lindner, who also is a major Circle K stockholder.
   At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Circle K listed assets of
$1.94 billion and liabilities of $1.58 billion. The company sought
protection in bankruptcy court after announcing it had been unable
to reach agreement with its creditors to restructure the debt.
   Monday's announcement said Circle K expected to file a list of
all liabilities and assets around August 28.
   ``At this time, the company cannot predict the scheduling or
ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings nor the effect upon
the value of any of its outstanding securities,'' the announcement
said. ``The company expects to file a bankruptcy reorganization
plan as soon as practicable.''

<HEAD>Ball Corp. Buying Interest in Continental Can</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ball Corp. announced plans today to pay
$1.025 billion in cash and stock for the European packaging
interests of Continental Can Co. Inc. and another $65 million for
the remaining interest in a glass packaging joint venture.
   Richard M. Rigeon, chairman and chief executive officer of Ball,
said the acquisitions would make Ball more competitive worldwide in
packaging.
   ``The new ventures will combine the best of North America with
the best of Europe, and will be an excellent opportunity to
leverage Ball's process and management technology over a much
larger business base.''
   Ball said it will pay $625 million in cash and $400 million in
Ball preferred and common stock for the two Continental Can
businesses.
   Continental Can is a privately-held business of Peter Kiewit
Sons' Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   Under the agreement Ball will pay Kiewit $200 million in common
stock, $129 million of voting and $71 million of non-voting
convertible exchangeable preferred stock. The Kiewit stock will
represent a 29 percent voting interest in Ball. Kiewit will be
restricted from purchasing additional Ball shares.
   Ball will pay $65 million cash for the 50 percent it does not
already own in the Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp. joint venture
between Ball and Holland-American Investment Corp.
   Both will be operated as wholly owned subsidiaries of Ball
Corp., with Ball In-Con retaining its own financing.
   Continental Can operates in Europe collectively as Continental
Can Europe and principally as Continental Can U.K. Ltd.,
Schmalbach-Lubeca A.G., Thomassen &amp; Drijver-Verblifa N.V.,
Continental Can France, SNC, and Continental PET France, SNC.
   Continental Can Europe, which employs 10,000 people in 33
locations, had sales of $1.47 billion in 1989. The company projects
1990 sales of $1.66 billion. The company makes food, beverage and
general metal containers, metal closures and plastic containers.
   Ball Corp. entered the metal beverage container industry in
1969. It is now the nation's fifth largest producer of bear and
soft drink cans. In the last 20 years the product line has become
Ball's largest, with 58 percent of total 1989 sales coming from
aluminum and steel beer and soft-drink cans and easy-opening ends.
Last year 63.9 percent of Ball's sales, or $780.9 million, was from
packaging products.
   Combined packaging sales of Ball, Continental Can Europe and
Ball-InCon last year would have been $2.78 billion, officials said.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Showing Signs of Stabilizing, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending for new construction dipped lower in
June but showed signs of stabilizing following a volatile first
half, according to a study released Monday.
   F.W. Dodge, a financial information division of McGraw-Hill,
said its index of new construction contracts fell in June to 153
from 156 in May.
   Spending for new construction totaled $240.72 billion in June,
compared with May's $245.71 billion.
   Dodge said new non-building construction, which includes public
works and utilities, fell 14 percent from May, when three public
works contracts totaling $300 million had inflated spending in that
category.
   Contracts for new non-residential construction, which includes
commercial building, increased by 5 percent, while residential
construction spending fell 1 percent.
   Despite the overall decline, Dodge found evidence that
construction spending was leveling off after having fallen to a
four-year low in April. The Dodge index reached 181 in September,
but then began to tumble, eventually dropping to 147 in April, as
builders found financing harder to come by.
   The index rebounded to 155 in May.
   George A. Christie, Dodge's chief economist, said most of the
volatility in construction now appeared to be in the past. Recent
figures show the building market is stabilizing, Christie said in a
statement.
   Through the first half of the year, total new construction
spending fell 8 percent from the same period a year earlier, to
$121.3 billion from $131.37 billion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose moderately Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting strength in the soybean oil
market, while corn and wheat futures fell amid slack export demand
for those grains.
   Forecasts for continued beneficial crop weather in the Midwest
also weighed on the corn market and limited soybean gains, analysts
said.
   Strength in the soybean complex was centered in the soybean oil
pit, where the contract for delivery in August closed up 61 cents
at 24.42 cents a pound.
   Martyn Foreman, grains analysts with AgriVisor Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill., said recent government reports have indicated
soy oil stocks are shrinking.
   ``The market's showing some response to that,'' he said.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
lighter-than-normal monsoon rains in parts of India had reduced
yield prospects for certain nuts that are traditionally crushed for
their oil. Soybean oil could provide a substitute, he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.94 a bushel; corn was
1 cent lower to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.61{ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 2 cents lower with September at $1.28 a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 6{ cents higher with August at $5.88{

   Stock prices lost more ground today in selling
attributed to worries about weakness in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 62.63 points last
week, slipped 2.22 to 2,896.29 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 553 up, 920 down and
488 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were still unsettled by Friday's report
that the gross national product grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year.
   The increase was smaller than expected, and reflected a buildup
in inventories rather than gains in final demand among consumers
and business purchasers.
   That was taken as an inauspicious sign for production and
corporate profits in the months ahead.
   Brokers said that gave investors little incentive to buy stocks,
especially given the tendency of individual issues to sell off
sharply of late in any instance of disappointing earnings.
   UAL dropped 4{ to 158{. The Wall Street Journal reported that
New York's Chemical Bank withdrew as a lead bank in the proposed
buyout of the airline holding company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.43 to 192.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.42 at 353.07.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.3 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.50 percent, up from 7.49 percent

<HEAD>Brokerage Founder Leading Candidate To Become New Chairman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   William H. Donaldson, a founder of the
securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., is the leading
candidate to become chairman of the New York Stock Exchange,
sources said Monday.
   The current chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., is retiring at the end
of 1990 after six years heading the nation's largest stock exchange.
   A final decision by the NYSE's board is expected to be made
within two weeks. Donaldson may not emerge as the final selection
but is considered the leading candidate, according to people
familiar with the selection process who asked not to be named.
   An eight-member search committee has been meeting since Phelan
announced his retirement in February.
   Donaldson, 59, now heads Donaldson Enterprises Inc., a merchant
banking and money management firm in New York. He did not return
telephone calls Monday seeking comment.
   New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard Torrenzano would
neither confirm nor deny whether Donaldson would be recommended to
succeed Phelan to the full exchange board.
   Torrenzano said the search panel has been ``diligently and
thoughtfully talking to people throughout the securities industry
as well as key corporate leaders for their input.''
   Donaldson was one of three founders of the securities firm that
bears his name. He left Donaldson Lufkin in 1973 to become an
undersecretary of state to Henry Kissinger. He later founded and
was the first dean of Yale University's School of Organization and
Management.
   Phelan has been widely praised for leading the exchange
successfully through the 1987 stock market crash that devastated
investor confidence. Among the issues to be faced by a new leader
are the NYSE's slowly shrinking market share, increased competition
from other exchanges the introduction of new technology.

<HEAD>Japanese Computer Company Agrees to Buy Britain's Top Computer
Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fujistu Ltd., the second largest mainframe
computer maker in the world, announced Monday it has agreed to buy
Britain's top computer manufacturer, International Computers Ltd.,
for $1.2 billion.
   The buyout will make Fujitsu the second largest computer group
in the world after U.S.-based International Business Machines
Corp., officials with the Japanese company said at a news
conference.
   Analysts have said the purchase would give Fujitsu a major sales
and manufacturing foothold in Europe ahead of the creation of the
single European market in 1992.
   It also makes the Japanese giant a player in the European
mainframe market for the first time. IBM now dominates that market.
   Michio Naruto, Fujitsu's managing director and vice general
manager of international operations in Tokyo, said the acquisition
illustrates the emergence of the $16.8 billion Japanese company as
a truly global computer maker.
   He acknowledged that the purchase might renew fears of Japanese
buyouts in some parts of Europe.
   But he sought to allay concerns by saying that ICL would
continue to be European-run. ICL, which currently does 60 percent
of its business in Britain, ``already has said its intention was to
expand to Europe. Fujitsu intends to support this intention,''
Naruto said.
   For ICL's part, the deal provides the mainframe manufacturer
with the funds and technology for research and development and for
its planned thrust in Europe.
   ``ICL's ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a
member of the Fujitsu family,'' said Arthur Walsh, chairman and
chief executive officer of STC PLC, the parent company of ICL, at a
London news conference.
   Fujitsu Chairman Takuma Yamamoto said his company intends to
seek a separate listing for ICL on London's International Stock
Exchange ``as soon as practicable.''
   Under the agreement, Fujitsu will pay ICL's parent company, STC
PLC, 700 million pounds, or about $1.2 billion, for an 80 percent
stake in the British computer firm. ICL itself will pay STC an
additional 42.8 million pounds, or about $73.4 million.
   There had been rumors for about a year about a possible equity
tie between ICL and Fujitsu, which already have technology links,
according to London analysts.
   ICL uses Fujitsu's computer chips and disks under a
nine-year-old agreement.
   Analysts consider ICL to be Europe's most profitable mainframe
computer maker. Yet in the first six months of the year, the
company suffered a 7.4 percent decline in operating profit to $107
million, on sales of $1.4 billion.
   Analysts said Fujitsu has the financial strength to help ICL
withstand what is expected to be an increasingly competitive
European market.
   ``We have come to respect ICL in the course of our technological
collaboration in the last nine years and this agreement builds on
that relationship,'' said Yamamoto.
   He said ICL's chairman and managing director, Peter Bonfield,
would continue in that position.
   Fujitsu's major activity in Europe is selling semiconductor
computer chips, although it makes office computers in Spain and
semiconductors in Ireland.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Finish Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most energy futures prices climbed Monday on the
back of a bullish OPEC agreement aimed at boosting crude oil prices
and cutting the oil glut.
   Trading activity was moderate on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 17 cents to $20.21 a
42-gallon barrel after losing 26 cents on Friday.
   Contracts for crude delivery during October through December
also settled higher.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
unleaded gasoline for August delivery jumped 1.00 cent to 65.88
cents a gallon after falling 0.38 cent on Friday. Later contracts
also posted substantial increases.
   The August contract for wholesale heating oil, which lost 0.35
cent on Friday, edged 0.04 cent lower to 56.93 cents a gallon. The
September through November contracts posted price gains, however.
   Meanwhile, in natural gas trading, the September contract
settled at $1.430 per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.439 on Friday.
Later contracts were mixed.
   An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to restrain crude oil production set a positive tone in
the market, energy analysts said.
   But the advance was held in check by profit-taking and
skepticism that OPEC will achieve its goals.
   The accord signed Friday by all of the cartel's 13 ministers
raises OPEC's target price to $21 a barrel from $18.
   To achieve its price increase the cartel set a new daily output
ceiling of 22.5 million barrels, a bit above the current cap but
lower than its actual production. In all, OPEC will have to rein in
production by about 700,000 barrels a day.

<TEXT>
   Developing countries of Southeast Asia deplored
the lack of progress in international trade negotiations and said
Monday that they feared being left out in the economic cold.
   In a strongly worded statement criticising developed nations,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand
said,``We are concerned that deals will be struck among the
principals in the fall and developing countries will be left out in
the cold.
   ``There seems to be no point in going further if this is going
to be the scenario ... We call on developed countries to show
leadership in the market access negotiations,'' said the statement
by the four countries, which together with Brunei make up the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN.
   Stating that the group places special emphasis on market access
it added, ``ASEAN views progress in this area as the gauge by which
to measure the seriousness of developed countries in taking
developing country concerns into account.''
   The global negotiations are called the Uruguay Round of Trade
Negotiations, aimed at better market access and freer trade. The
round is scheduled to conclude in December.
   ``... The possibility that the round will end as a failure does
not seem unthinkable,'' the statement said giving details of how
the developed nations were attaching conditions for tax concessions
and quotas for tropical products, textiles, agricultural and farm
products and other goods.
   The ASEAN nations are attending the nine-month-old Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting here Monday and Tuesday where
they differed with the developed nations in discussions on the
trade talks.
   The other members of the 12-nation APEC are the United States,
Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea.
   Two separate statements were issued on their discussions, a mild
one by APEC and a strongly worded one by ASEAN.
   Asked why there were differences, Singapore's Trade Minister Lee
Hsien Loong told a news conference there were ``differences on
naunces of views.'' But, he said, they were united in wanting
faster progress.
   But a senior ASEAN official, who spoke on condition he would not
be identified by name, said,``Of course there are deep differences.
At the rate we are going they will give us nothing or very little
... That is why our views were expressed so strongly.''
   The APEC statement said the trade talks had not made enough
progress and it ``was the single most important issue on the
international agenda''.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama asked APEC to admit
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which want to be members. But
conference officials said they doubted they would be admitted here
although membership was possible later.
   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abu Hassan and others spoke about
developments in Eastern Europe and the single European market
coming in 1992. Fears were expressed that international funds might
be diverted to Eastern European development resulting in less aid,
trade, and investment for the Asia-Pacific region.
   Conference officials said Singapore's Foreign Minister Wong Kan
Seng asked for an expert group to be set up to study how this could
be avoided and how stronger relations with Europe could be
established.

   President Alberto Fujimori on Monday ordered a
two-day nationwide banking holiday to give his two-day-old
goverment time to begin implementing a new economic program.
   Banks were closed throughout Peru Monday, as the mandatory
holiday was effective immediatrely.
   Fujimori told reporters Monday that the economic measures
planned by his government will not affect savings.
   ``Quite the contrary,'' he said. ``We want to encourage
Peruvians to save and the measures are aimed at that goal.''
   Fujimori was sworn into office last Saturday for a five-year
term, suceeding moderate-leftist Alan Garcia.
   The president said the economic platform will be announced to
the country Thursday or Friday by Prime Minister and Economy
Minister Juan Carlos Hurtado.
   Fujimori inherited a critical economic situation from Garcia,
with rampant inflation, high unemployment and a deep recession.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who took on
General Motors Corp. and its Corvair 25 years ago, sent an 11-page
letter to the incoming GM chairman Monday, outlining how the
automaker can ``correct some of Roger Smith's mistakes.''
   Smith steps down Tuesday as chairman of GM, a post he held Monday and
had not
had a chance to read it.
   ``Mr. Stempel usually reads his correspondence,'' Crellin said.
   Nader said he did not send a similar letter to Ford Motor Co.
Chairman Harold Poling when he took over from Donald Petersen on
March 1. ``I focus on the big boy, General Motors,'' Nader said.
   In the GM letter, Nader discussed 13 recommendations he says can
benefit GM and consumers. They include safety, quality, corporate
democracy and recycling.
   ``This is a plea for Robert Stempel to start a clean slate in
all directions,'' Nader said. ``The key test in that letter is
meeting with consumer and environmental groups.
   ``It's something their culture has kept them from doing.''

   Blue-chip stocks recovered some of last week's
losses with a late rebound Monday, while the rest of the market
settled for a mixed showing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points in
the early going, closed with an 18.82 gain at 2,917.33. The average
fell 62.63 points last week.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
717 up, 792 down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.47 million
shares, against 149.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 177.52 million shares.
   Analysts said investors were still unsettled by Friday's report

   The increase was smaller than expected, and reflected a buildup

production and corporate profits in the months ahead.
   Nevertheless, brokers said many of the big-name blue chips
attracted buyers looking for ``bargains'' after the market's sharp

   Energy stocks took a leading role in the afternoon rally, still
responding to an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreement last week on production limits to bolster world oil
prices.
   Exxon, up 1{ at 50}; Chevron, up 1} at 79, and Texaco, up 1&rsqb; at

Among other stocks in the group, Atlantic Richfield rose 2} to

   UAL dropped 6&lsqb; to 156~. The Wall Street Journal reported that
New York's Chemical Bank withdrew as a lead bank in the proposed

   Duke Power, which declared a 2-for-1 stock split and raised its
quarterly dividend from 78 cents a share to 82 cents a share,
gained 1{ to 57.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Copper Futures Drop Sharply, Ending 4-Day Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, ending a four-day rally amid speculation that
London warehouse stocks of the metal have grown.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; grains
and soybeans were mixed; energy futures rose; and livestock and
meat futures were mostly higher.
   Copper futures settled .80 cent to 2.35 cents lower in New York
with the contract for delivery in August off 2.3 cents to $1.244 a
pound.
   The copper market had risen strongly in five of the six previous
sessions, including the last four, on concerns about relatively
tight supplies and a strike that began Thursday against the
state-owned Peruvian mining and refining company Mineroperu.
   But the strike was settled over the weekend and analysts believe
demand for copper may be easing, based on indications that
warehouse stocks documented by the London Metal Exchange rose in
the past week. The London exchange's report on warehouse stocks was
due out Tuesday.
   An early decline of more than 20 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average also prompted selling of copper futures on the
belief that a weakening economy would translate into weaker copper
demand.
   The market recovered, though, and ended the day with a gain of
nearly 19 points.
   Frederick D'Agostino, president of Metal Resources Inc., a
Riverside, Conn., dealer in scrap and refined copper, said the
recent runup was not justified by actual supply-and-demand factors.
   ``Everything I know, everything I've read, says the market's
about 15 cents overpriced,'' D'Agostino said.
   He said market players who are not involved in the physical
copper trade can sometimes bid prices up to unrealistic levels, but
``ultimately, supply and demand do determine price.''
   In precious metal trading on the Commodity Exchange, gold
futures finished 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at
$367.80 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 4.5 cents lower with
September at $4.84 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting strength in the soybean oil market.
   Wheat futures fell and corn futures were mixed amid slack export
demand for those grains.
   Forecasts for continued beneficial crop weather in the Midwest
also weighed on the corn market and limited soybean gains, analysts
said.
   After the close, the National Weather Service released a new
six-to-10 day outlook predicting normal temperatures and normal to
above-normal rainfall for the Midwest during the first half of next
week.
   A 30-day forecast predicted above-normal rainfall for the region
through August.
   Also after the close, the Agriculture Department released a
weekly crop-progress report that showed development of the corn and
soybean crops still lagging far behind the normal pace.
   The slow crop development is a function of heavy spring rains
that delayed planting. Fears have begun to surface in the markets
that some late-planted crops could suffer frost damage.
   Wheat futures settled 2} cents to 4{ cents lower with September
at $2.94 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $2.61 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with
September at $1.28 a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 6\ cents
higher with August at $5.88 a bushel.
   Most energy futures prices climbed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on the back of a bullish OPEC agreement aimed at boosting
crude oil prices and cutting the oil glut.
   Analysts said last week's agreement by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrain crude oil production set
a positive tone in the market. But the advance was held in check by
profit-taking and skepticism that OPEC will achieve its goals.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 34 cents
higher with September at $20.21 a barrel; heating oil futures were
.04 cent lower to .51 higher with August at 56.93 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 1 cent higher with August at
65.88 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were unchanged
to .40 cent higher with August at 77.97 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .15 cent to .32 cent higher with August at 89.27 cents
a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .70 cent higher with August at
60.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent lower to
1.65 cent higher with August at 49.22 cents a pound.

   The dollar fell broadly against major foreign
currencies Monday, continuing a drop prompted by a weakening U.S.
economy and the prospect of lower interest rates.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   ``Global investors don't think the dollar is very attractive
right now,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Traders said the dollar closed at its lowest level in more than
two years against the West German mark and at about a two-year low
against the British pound.
   Chris Mendell, a vice president with Security Pacific National
Bank in Los Angeles, said that as differences in global interest
rates have narrowed, rates of return for investors in Europe and
Japan have become higher or comparable to those in the United
States.
   Monday's market activity was largely a carryover from Friday,
when the dollar tumbled in reaction to reports of slow growth in
June of the gross national product, which measures the nation's
total output of goods and services.
   The financial markets believe that with the U.S. economy
continuing to slump, the Federal Reserve will push interest rates
lower to help stimulate growth.
   But such a move would come at the expense of the dollar.
Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in
U.S. yields makes the dollar less competitive.
   ``The market since the GNP report Friday has increased its
conviction that the dollar will go back down,'' Mendell said.
   The British pound climbed against the dollar, following up on a
more than 2 cent rise on Friday. Sterling rose to $1.8465 in New
York from late Friday's $1.8375. In London earlier, the British
pound rose to $1.8440 from $1.8350 late Friday.
   Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6040 West German marks, down from 1.6120;
1.3602 Swiss francs, down from 1.3620; 5.3725 French francs, down
from 5.3990; 1,174.25 Italian lire, down from 1,180.00; and 1.15245
Canadian dollars, up from 1.15195.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6085 West German marks, down from 1.6145;
1.3653 Swiss francs, down from 1.3680; 5.3885 French francs, down
from 5.4080; 1.8125 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8205; 1,177.50
Italian lire, down from 1,182.00, and 1.1525 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1521.
   The dollar fell to 147.83 Japanese yen in New York from 149.10
late Friday. In Tokyo earlier, the dollar tumbled 2.15 yen to a
closing 148.60 Japanese yen and it was quoted in London at 148.15
yen.
   Gold fell 20 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to
$367.80 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York later
quoted a bid of $367.70, up 40 cents from Friday.
   In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid of $367.25 a troy
ounce, up from $367.15 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a
closing bid of $367.50 an ounce, down from $367.15 late Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 18 cents to close at $367.86 a troy ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. Silver for current delivery slipped
2.9 cents to $4.803 a troy ounce on New York's Comex. Silver rose
in London to a late bid of $4.83 a troy ounce from $4.80 late
Friday.

<HEAD>Wang Reports $496.7 Million Fourth Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. reported Monday it
lost $496.7 million in the April through June period as the
computer firm continued to accumulate charges from a restructuring
that included a 30 percent workforce cut.
   The loss, which came to $3.01 per share, was more than 30
percent greater than the $374.7 million, or $2.29 a share, loss in
the same period last year. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter
was $652.2 million, compared with $750.9 million for the same
period last year.
   Securities analyst Casey Stern of the New York-based Altman
Brenner Wasserman and Co., said Monday that Wang Chairman Richard
W. Miller's drastic moves to restructure the company were paying
off. Despite the fourth quarter losses, he predicted that the
company would post a profit in fiscal 1991 on revenues of $2.5
billion.
   Miller had reduced a $575 million bank debt last August to the
current $30 million and cut about 10,000 employees, from 29,200 to
19,000.
   In a statement, Miller said, ``Although this re-evaluation has
resulted in substantial restructuring charges and non-recurring
balance sheet adjustment, we believe the decisions that have been
made position the company for future profitability in a changing
industry.''
   Miller said the restructuring costs stemmed from the continuing
implementation of Operation Customer, Wang's attempt to reorient
itself to changing markets and new customer needs.
   Stern said Wang had made headway in reducing the bureaucracy
that had alienated customers.
   The company reported a net loss for fiscal 1990 of $715.9
million, or $4.35 per share, on revenues of $2.497 billion. In
fiscal 1989, the net loss was $424.3 million, or $2.59 per share,
on revenues of 2.910 billion.

<HEAD>Unocal Net Up 38 Percent for 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp. said Monday its second-quarter
profits rose 38 percent, in part because of an after-tax gain from
the sale of a Norwegian subsidiary and higher domestic natural gas
prices.
   Second-quarter revenues were down, however, falling to $2.72
billion from $3.07 billion in 1989, the company said.
   For the April-June quarter, the energy company earned $165
million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $120 million, or 51
cents per share, in second-quarter 1989.
   For the first six months of 1990, Unocal's net earnings were
$242 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with six-month 1989
earnings of $207 million, or 88 cents per share.
   Unocal Chairman Richard Stegemeier said the latest results
reflected a $132 million after-tax gain from the sale of the
company's wholly owned Norwegian oil and gas subsidiary. He also
cited higher gas prices and production, and lower deferred income
taxes and net interest expense.
   Six-month revenues were $5.36 billion, compared with $5.70
billion last year. Unocal attributed the drop primarily to the
absence of petroleum product sales by Unocal's Midwest Marketing
Division, now part of a joint venture.

<HEAD>Natural Gas Distributors Unite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of Minnegasco Inc. has
agreed to become part of Arkla Inc.'s natural gas operations in a
stock swap valued at about $630 million, the two companies
announced Monday.
   The boards of Diversified Energies Inc. and Arkla agreed to the
merger, which is subject to approval of each firm's shareholders
and government regulators, the companies said in a statement.
   If completed, the deal would create the nation's third largest
gas distribution system with 2.6 million customers and 1 trillion
cubic feet in annual volume, the companies said.
   The combined company's estimated combined revenues would total
$3 billion.
   Thomas F. Mack McLarty III, president and chief executive
officer of Arkla, and Albert D. Etchelecu, DEI's president and CEO,
said the transaction probably would be completed by the end of the
year.
   McLarty would continue as Arkla's chairman, president and CEO
under the agreement. Etchelecu would serve as vice chairman of
Arkla's board of directors and continue as chairman and chief
executive of Minneapolis-based natural gas distributor Minnegasco.
   Under the agreement, DEI stockholders will receive between 1.575
and 1.752 shares of Arkla common stock for each share of DEI common
stock. Monday's news release said the exact number of exchanged
shares would be based on Arkla's trading price immediately prior to
completion of the transaction.
   Based on recent trading prices, the release said, owners of
approximately 16 million DEI common shares would get about $39
worth of Arkla stock for each share of DEI stock they own.
   DEI wwould pay Arkla $3 million and reimburse expenses of up to
another $3 million if the deal falls through.
   Arkla, based in Little Rock and Shreveport, has the nation's
sixth largest pipeline operations and about two million customers
in an eight-state region.
   Arkla's serves southwestern Illinois and all or parts of
Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and
Texas. Its service area includes such major metropolitan areas as
St. Louis, Houston and Wichita.
   Minnegasco serves about 650,000 customers in an area extending
from Minnesota to Nebraska. Principal cities served by Minnegasco
are Minneapolis; Sioux Falls, S.D., and Lincoln, Neb.
   Meanwhile, in a report issued Monday, DEI said it had a loss of
$2.9 million, or 18 cents per share, on revenues of $127.8 million
for the second quarter ended June 30. That compared with a loss of
$400,000, or 3 cents per share, on revenues of $136.4 million for
the same quarter last year. The company attributed reduced earnings
in its radio communications unit, E.F. Johnson, for the loss.

   Grand Metropolitan Food Sector has put Peter

International, Haagen-Dazs and Grand Met Foodservice USA.
   Thompson, whose new title is chief executive of the Sector
Brands Division, was also named an executive vice president of
Grand Met's Food Sector, the company said Monday.
   Thompson, formerly president and chief executive officer of
Grand Met's Paddington Corporation, a New Jersey-based importer and
marketer of distilled spirits, joined Grand Met in 1983. Thompson
had been president of Pepsico Produtos Ltda. in Brasil and worked
for J. Walter Thompson Co. and General Foods Corp.
   ``Peter's 20 years experience in the consumer foods industry,
with a focus on international markets, also fits well with our
plans to make Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and Green Giant major players
in the international marketplace,'' Ian Martin, chairman and chief
executive of Grand Met's Food Sector, said.
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, one of the largest international
companies in the United Kingdom and a world leader in drinks,
retailing and food, has sales in excess of $15 billion. U.S.
subsidiaries include ALPO Petfoods, Burger King, Carillon
Importers, Haagen-Dazs, Heublein, The Paddington Corp., Pearle

<HEAD>Dollar Continues Downward, But Nikkei Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to retreat against the
Japanese yen during early trading Tuesday morning and the Nikkei
Stock Average reversed its seven-day decline.
   The dollar opened at 147.75 yen, down 0.85 yen from its close
Monday at 148.60 yen. It fell to 147.83 Japanese yen in New York
overnight from 149.10 late Friday.
   The dollar has taken a beating against most major currencies
since last Friday, when it tumbled in reaction to the U.S. gross
national product's slow growth in June.
   Financial markets believe the Federal Reserve will push interest
rates lower to help stimulate growth.
   But Chizuko Satsukawa, a currency trader with Chemical Bank in
Tokyo, said Tuesday's lower opening in Tokyo reflected more a
demand for yen in cross trading with the German mark than any
inherent weakness in the dollar.
   ``Many dealers thought that with the end of the month, there
would be an increased demand for dollars, but that seems not to
have materialized,'' she said.
   Nevertheless, she predicted the dollar would not fall much
further, bottoming out somewhere around 147.40 yen.
   On the stock market, the closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of
225 selected issues rose 436.64 points, or 1.43 percent, to
30,879.59 points 30 minutes after trading began.
   The Nikkei average has lost 2,176.03 points, or 6.58 percent,
since July 19.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond also reversed its direction Tuesday morning, rising to 85.23
points from 85.14 points at the Monday close. Yields fell to 7.585
percent from 7.605 percent.

<HEAD>Army Awards Potential $700 Million Computer Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army has awarded a Herndon, Va.,
firm a contract worth potentially $700 million to produce an office
computer system, officials said Monday.
   Electronic Data Systems received the indefinite delivery,
indefinite quantity contract Thursday from the Army's Information
Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency.
   The computers will be used for administrative tasks by the Army,
Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency, Army spokeswoman Helen
Garamone said.
   Each 32-bit modular unit will be able to handle from four to 16
users, she said. The government expects to buy between 40 and
20,000 units worldwide by 1995, she said.
   The contract also includes a wide range of peripherals, software
and networking products. Electronic Data is responsible for
engineering, installation, training and maintenance.
   The contract also requires Electronic Data to construct the
system so it can interact with the Army's many existing computer
systems and some planned ones, Ms. Garamone said.
   Electronic Data plans to subcontract 25 percent of the work to
small businesses.
   The government first asked for proposals for the system in March
1988, Ms. Garamone said.
   Award of the contract was postponed because more bids than
expected were received and resulted in a longer evaluation period,
according to Barbara Johnson, a contracting officer.

<HEAD>Varity Corp. Wants Shareholders To Support Move To U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Varity Corp., one of the world's largest farm
equipment makers, plans to ask shareholders for permission to move
its headquarters to Buffalo, N.Y., company officials said Monday.
   Varity is ``already a U.S. company with a Canadian address''
because over 80 percent of its shareholders live in the United
States, said Victor Rice, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Most of Varity's North American employees work in U.S. plants
and U.S.-based customers will account for some 50 percent of 1990
revenues, displacing Europe as the company's biggest market, Rice
said.
   He said Varity, as a U.S. company, would rank among the
country's top 130 publicly traded enterprises.
   Varity is considering a headquarters move to Buffalo to make its
stock more widely available to U.S. investors and to relieve them
of the Canadian government's 15 percent withholding tax on
dividends, company officials say.
   But Canadian officials have said their government will sue if
necessary to block the move.
   The move would violate a pledge Varity, then known as
Massey-Ferguson, made in 1986 in return for a $169.1 million
government bailout, according to officials of the Ontario
Development Corp. a quasi-public agency that funnels government
loans to businesses.
   The officials say Varity agreed to maintain or create 1,500 jobs
in Canada by 1993 and also keep its headquarters there.
   Varity recently purchased a mansion in Buffalo and won an $11.5
million package of tax exemptions from the Erie County Industrial
Development Agency. Those actions prompted public warnings from
Canadian officials that Varity would face a court fight if it moved
its headquarters.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. Inc., once the nation's
largest penny-stock brokerage firm, on Monday asked U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for protection from creditors while it reorganizes.
   In a brief news release Monday night announcing the filing under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, the firm said it plans to
transfer its customer accounts and brokerage operations to another
broker-dealer.
   Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged the troubled Colorado brokerage of overcharging investors
by more than $20 million in 21 months.
   According to a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Blinder,
Robinson marked up prices as high as 140 percent on penny stocks
when selling them to investors.
   The SEC claimed the activity took place from June 1985 through
February 1987.
   Last April the SEC suspended Blinder Robinson from trading in
penny stocks for 45 days and from underwriting such offerings for
two years. The SEC also barred the firm's founder and chairman,
Meyer Blinder, from associating with any registered broker-dealer
for at least two years.
   Blinder, 69, of Denver, and four associates were indicted in
February on racketeering and securities fraud charges by a federal
grand jury in Las Vegas. The indictment followed a 1988 Internal
Revenue Service raid on Blinder Robinson's Denver office.
   Penny stocks are low cost, high risk securities, usually trading
for less than $3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges
and typically are used to raise capital for new or small companies.
