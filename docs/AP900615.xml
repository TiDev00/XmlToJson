<HEAD>Jury Selection Complete for Second Bensonhurst Trial</HEAD>

   Jury selection in the second Bensonhurst racial
slaying trial ended Thursday, but the defense attorney argued the
panel couldn't be impartial because of widespread pretrial
publicity.
   The jurors, four of whom are black, will decide the fate of John
Vento, 21, who backed out of a deal with prosecutors to trade
testimony for immunity.
   In March, Vento was charged with murder, riot, assault, unlawful
imprisonment and other crimes in the slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, 16.
   Hawkins, who was black, was fatally shot in August after he and
three black friends were chased through predominantly white
Bensonhurst by a mob of bat-wielding whites.
   The four black teens were unarmed and had gone into the Brooklyn
neighborhood to look at a used car for sale.
   Joseph Fama, 19, convicted last month in Hawkins' death, was
sentenced on Monday to the maximum 32 and two-thirds years to life
in prison.
   Keith Mondello, also 19, was acquitted of murder and
manslaughter but was convicted of riot, unlawful imprisonment and
discrimination. He received the maximum 5 1-3 years to 16 years in
prison.
   Judge Thaddeus Owens rejected a request by Vento's attorney,
Gerald DiChiara, to postpone the trial and scheduled opening
arguments to begin Monday.
   DiChiara requested that Vento's trial be put off for at least
two months, arguing that the national attention the murder and
trial has attracted made it impossible to find an impartial jury.
   ``I still believe that the timing of this jury selection is
improper and I do believe the jurors are under a strain to be fair
and impartial,'' DiChiara said.
   After the shooting, Vento reportedly told detectives he saw Fama
shoot Hawkins. He testified before a grand jury investigating the
case and was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
agreeing to take the witness stand against his friends.
   But he backed out of the deal and fled the city around Christmas.
   In March, after forcing a one-month delay in the start of Fama's
and Mondello's trial, Vento surrendered to the FBI in Dayton, Ohio.
He is being held without bail.

<HEAD>Justice Investigating Airline Activities In Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
USAir Group Inc. for possible antitrust violations involving its
operations at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport, the company
said.
   In a May 31 action known as a civil investigative demand, the
Justice Department ordered the company to produce documents and
other information relating to activities at the airport.
   USAir said it was informed by the Justice Department that other
airlines and other airports are being investigated.
   USAir Group is the parent company of USAir, which is the largest
tenant at the Pittsburgh airport and handles a substantial number
of the flights there.
   The probe's existence was disclosed recently by USAir in
connection with the issuance of $84.6 million in revenue bonds for
construction of a new terminal at the airport.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Frank Kelly, declined to comment
on the nature of the investigation. He said the civil investigative
demand is equivalent to a subpoena but does not mean a civil or
criminal action has been undertaken.
   USAir spokesman John Bronson said the airline would comply with
the Justice Department's request and was gathering all relevant
documents. He said he did not know the exact nature of the Justice
Department inquiry.
   The solicitor for Allegheny County, which has a business
relationship with USAir relating to the new terminal, said the
request for information appears to be part of a broader probe. The
investigation probably involves fares charged by airlines at hub
airports, said Solicitor Ira Weiss.
   A report issued last year by the General Accounting Office found
that fares charged at 15 hub airports were about one-fourth higher
than fares charged at 38 other airports served by a larger number
of carriers.
   The study found that fares charged at Pittsburgh were as much as
8 cents per mile more than fares at the 38 airports.
   Weiss said one aspect of the USAir probe involves its dealings
with the county. The airline and the county negotiated a long-term
lease two years ago for construction of the $592 million terminal.
   According to the bond statement, the Justice Department is
examining possible violations of the Sherman Act by ``conduct,
activities or proposed action relating to restrictions on
facilities at the airport.''
   The Sherman Act makes it illegal for companies to restrain trade
in the United States or with foreign countries or to conspire to do
so. It also prohibits monopolizing trade or commerce in the United
States or with foreign countries or attempting or conspiring to do
so.
   Weiss said he believed the investigation arose out of USAir's
large share of traffic at the Pittsburgh airport.
   In 1987, the Justice Department opposed the merger of USAir and
Piedmont airlines, but dropped its objections after determining the
consolidation would not hurt competition.

<TEXT>
   A collection of the country's leading rap
singers went on national television Thursday night to launch a new
song aimed at stopping gang violence.
   Ice-T, Tone-Loc, Young MC, MC Hammer and N.W.A. and others sang
``We're All in the Same Gang'' on the syndicated talk show ``The
Arsenio Hall Show,'' seen in 204 television markets nationwide.
   The song, in which various rappers sing different verses, is
part of Peace Weekend, an attempt to curtail gang violence this
weekend and in the future.
   ``This is just a stepping stone,'' rapper Tone-Loc said on the
television show, adding that children must not succumb to peer
pressure and join gangs.
   ``All you have to do is get 'em while they're young and kick 'em
in the butt,'' he said.
   Ice-T, a former gang member, said gang violence is moving into
the suburbs.
   ``People don't care about anything unless it's in their back
yards,'' he said. ``We're all in the same gang, we're all in the
same race _ the human race.''
   The performance was organized by Michael Concepcion, a founding
member of the Crips gang. He uses a wheelchair because of a gunshot
injury he suffered while a gang member.

<DATELINE>PERQUIN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War and rain have made a rusty steel
cable 50 feet above a swollen river the umbilical cord between half
of Morazan province and the rest of El Salvador.
   Isolation that has come with every rainy season since 1983, when
guerrillas blew up the bridge, makes a hard life harder for the
50,000 people north of the Torola River.
   They are virtually cut off from May to October, when the river
is too deep for even trucks to ford.
   The people of this town nestled among mist-shrouded hills pray
for the war to end.
   Salt, cooking oil, sugar _ almost everything except the corn,
beans and coffee they grow _ must be hauled along the cable in a
precarious iron gondola. The gondola also is the only transport for
a mother and sick child who must reach the provincial capital, San
Francisco Gotera.
   The region, along with the northern half of Chalatenango
province to the west, is the zone hit hardest by a 10-year-old
civil war that has brutalized this small Central American country.
   Rebels destroyed the bridge to hamper the movement of army
troops. Soldiers have entered the area by helicopter since.
   Perquin is a guerrilla bastion 75 miles northeast of San
Salvador. Most of the 600 residents seem to support the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, whose fighters can be found on
street corners, talking with townsfolk.
   On the last Sunday in May, about 400 rebels mustered in the main
square to hear a speech from the top guerrilla field commander.
   With scores of villagers looking on, several dozen fighters
received shoulder patches distinguishing them for valor during and
since the big rebel offensive in November.
   The people of this town nestled among mist-shrouded hills pray
for the war to end. Strict limits are imposed on the amount of food
each family may take north from the provincial capital each month.
   Medicine, boots, adult clothing and flashlight batteries _ there
is no electricity north of the Torola _ are considered war materiel
and are confiscated at roadblocks.
   Some kinds of fertilizer are banned because they can be used to
make explosives.
   ``I've grown tired of arguing with them,'' said Juan Jose
Rodriguez, a farmer riding in the back of a truck from Perquin to
the river. ``They refuse to accept the obvious truth that we who
are not guerrillas also need shoes and clothing and batteries.''
   Because they have suffered in greater measure, the people of
Perquin want peace perhaps even more than the rest of their 5
million countrymen.
   ``We can't take anymore,'' said Modesto Diaz, a 61-year-old
farmer. ``Peace would be the best thing, but it is not a simple
matter of laying down the guns. There have to be changes and
accords first.''
   Diaz said the army killed his brother and a nephew in 1983.
   ``Someone incorrectly reported them as guerrillas, so the
soldiers came and killed them,'' he said. ``They didn't bother to
investigate.''
   Trinidad Ramos has spent all his 75 years in and around Perquin,
cultivating corn and beans.
   His callused feet and gnarled, almost nailless toes were shod in
thick-soled sandals and he sat on a porch, observing life through
horn-rimmed glasses mended at one hinge with green string.
   ``If it hadn't been for the idiocy of the war, this town would
have prospered,'' he said. ``God willing, it will end soon.''
   Government and rebel representatives met for five days in May in
Caracas, Venezuela, to set an agenda for concluding the war. The
U.N.-sponsored talks are the most promising in six years, but great
differences must be resolved.
   Townspeople in the square nodded as Commander Jorge Melendez
declared: ``Our society is captive to the military. Our democracy
is captive to militarism.''
   The rebels demand ``demilitarization,'' beginning with a purge
of human rights abusers from army ranks and a steady reduction of
troop strength. They say the goal should be abolition of the armed
forces in ``the midterm'' _ perhaps within five years _ leaving a
civilian-run police force to keep order.
   President Alfredo Cristiani'a rightist government has
acknowledged that, when the war is over, El Salvador will not need
such a large army.
   Government spokesmen decline specific comment, citing the
agreement of the two sides on strict confidentiality.
   Officials have said in private, however, that the 56,000-member
security forces could be reduced by about 60 percent after a peace
agreement took effect.

<TEXT>
   The violence that marked Romania's
overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu always seems ready to explode _ a
product of the bloodiest Communist rule in Eastern Europe and
centuries of ethnic and political strife.
   The overwhelming victory of President-elect Ion Iliescu and his
National Salvation Front in May, five months after Ceausescu's
ouster, only heightened the traditional divisions in society.
   Iliescu's triumph left the opposition with little power to exert
political pressure on him, and debate moved into the streets.
   The press, with several exceptions, offers little constructive
criticism, enflaming rather than calming passions.
   ``We destroyed the political power of Communism. But the social,
economic and administrative structures are in their place, and that
is the second phase of the revolution,'' Stelian Tanase, editor of
the weekly ``22,'' said in an interview.
   Predicting chaos in the next six months as the economy
deteriorates and workers start to strike, Tanase said the Salvation
Front will gradually lose power.
   For now, however, Iliescu can rely on the Communist structures
he inherited virtually intact to enforce his will.
   He summoned tens of thousands of supporters into the streets
Thursday. The tactic only added to Wednesday's violent clashes
between anti-government demonstrators and security forces.
   Iliescu's backers clubbed opponents to the ground, ransacked
opposition party offices and demanded a ban on the independent
newspaper Romania Libera.
   Their actions feed on fear of a changing future and ignorance of
democratic institutions bred by five decades of Communist or
fascist rule.
   By casting himself as the guardian of those workers and their
interests, Iliescu has limited his ability to maneuver for change.
   Iliescu is ``prisoner of the apparatus ... of the engine on
which he jumped,'' said Thomas Kleininger, vice chairman of a
leading intellectual group, the Group for Social Democracy in a May
interview.
   ``He could have the best intentions, but he can't do what he
wants,'' Kleininger said of Iliescu.
   ``The almost unique chance to take now the road of genuine
democracy and join in the flow of European values has been missed,
at least for a while, with amazing carelessness,'' the daily
Romania Libera wrote after Iliescu's May 20 election.
   The failure to dismantle Communist structures in Romania leaves
in place the terror bred by one of the most brutal instruments of
repression in eastern Europe.
   After World War II, Romania's Communist Party was merely a few
hundred dedicated Marxist-Leninists mostly trained in Moscow, but
those Communists used a mixture of political intrigue and bloody
repression to seize power.
   Tens of thousands of peasants and intellectuals were either
killed or died working on public projects.
   Communist leader Gheorge Gheorgiu-Dej died in 1965, paving the
way for the initially more liberal rule of Ceausescu. Cultivated by
the West as a communist maverick, he built up trade ties taboo
elsewhere in eastern Europe.
   Gradually, however, Ceausescu's rule grew more and more harsh.
By last December, when he was ousted in a popular revolt backed by
the army, his 23 million citizens lived in terror of a network of
Securitate secret police and informers.
   Intellectuals say Iliescu and the Salvation Front exploited this
fear to inflate the violence of the revolution. The Front allowed
rumors that tens of thousands died to run unchecked and continually
warned of the danger from Securitate agents battling soldiers.
   Psychological terror blended with real danger during the
revolution to make those figures believable. In the months since,
the government has quietly admitted the death toll was much lower,
just over 1,000. It has never said how many Securitate agents it
captured or killed.
   Everywhere in Eastern Europe, the secret police has proved the
most perfidious aspect of Communist rule. Its legacy in Romania is
stronger because the terror was greater.
   The problem in Romania is compounded by greater ethnic
differences and greater economic devastation than elsewhere in
eastern Europe.
   Ethnic tensions could explode, as they did in the Transylvanian
town of Tirgu Mures in March, when clashes between ethnic
Hungarians and Romanians left at least six people dead.
   The nationalist tensions of the Balkans, whose varied peoples
remember centuries-old battles as if they occurred yesterday, were
kept in check by Communist repression. Now, as elsewhere, they find
freer expression in Romania.

   Fearing a rise in terrorist attacks, police are
using people power to fight back. A campaign around New Delhi seeks
to educate residents on how to ferret out terrorists and spot
potential bombs. The reward: a safer city and maybe some cash for
helpful tips.

<TEXT>
   If anti-terrorist squads have their way,
New Delhi's landlords will be more inquisitive, citizens more
cautious and growling watchdogs ever viligant.
   Fearing a rise in bombings linked to two separatist movements,
police this week launched a city-wide campaign designed to help
uncover terrorists and thwart attacks.
   ``The basic idea is to create security awareness,'' said New
Delhi Deputy Commissioner of Police Neeraj Kumar.
   Although the focus of the effort is terrorism, police are also
warning that general crime around the nation is expected to rise by
100 percent during the decade, according to government estimates.
   The ``Crime Prevention Week'' program has an added significance
in India's capital, where 16 people have been killed and 109
injured this year in bomb blasts blamed on Sikh militants.
   Authorities are also worried another separatist battle waged by
Moslem factions in the northwestern state of Jammu-Kashmir will
spread to the capital. At least 300 people have died since
government troops began a crackdown in the province in January.
   ``New Delhi is a favorite target of the extremists. And any
crime-prevention program in New Delhi in the present circumstances
cannot ignore terrorism,'' said a senior police officer who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Around the city of about 6 million residents, posters urge to
keep a lookout for terrorists. A leaflet, ``How to Terrorize
Terrorists,'' is being distributed along with free door chains.
   Police are also conducting seminars on safety measures and
appealing to people to adopt a puppy, which could become a
formidable watchdog. Cash awards are now offered for helpful
information about extremists.
   Since January, seven bombs have exploded in New Delhi. In
addition, several high-powered explosive devices were found and
defused. One was discovered in the crowded New Delhi railway
station.
   Several suspects have been arrested in connection with the
blasts, but no one has been convicted.
   Sikh militants, fighting for a separate homeland in the rich
farming state of Punjab, have been blamed for many terrorist
attacks since the early 1980s.
   In 1985, a series of bombs, often concealed in transistor
radios, killed at least 87 people in the capital. Two years later,
Sikh gunmen fired on a birthday party south of New Delhi, killing
nine people and injuring 14.
   Sikhs have been blamed for more than 5,000 deaths around the
nation since 1987.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has ordered high walls and
watch towers around his New Delhi residence for fear of attacks by
Sikhs, who assassinated his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,
in 1984.
   This week's anti-terrorist campaign is paying special attention
to landlords, who police say often rent apartments without checking
tenants' identification and background.
   ``To instill fear in the terrorist's mind ... be sure about the
credentials of your tenant,'' says one police leaflet.
   And potential bombs could be anywhere or anything, authorities
warn.
   ``Always be alert for unattended luggage. While traveling in
buses look out for passengers behaving in a suspicious manner. If
you spot any suspicious-looking object do not touch the object. It
may be a bomb,'' according to a police statement.
   At least one police official said the campaign has been
successful.
   ``Just try leaving your camera at any major intersection. Nobody
will pick it up and it will lie unclaimed for weeks,'' said the
official, who wished to remain anonymous.
   ``Crime Prevention Week'' is scheduled to move throughout New
Delhi's 100 precincts in coming weeks.

<HEAD>Congressmen Quarrel Over Pace of Action on Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a proposed constitutional amendment
against burning the American flag claim it is being rushed through
as ammunition for fall campaigns, but sponsors say it should move
faster.
   ``Everybody seems to understand that we have to get this done
before the elections in November,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said
Thursday. ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see what's
driving this thing.''
   The comment came as part of an outpouring of Flag Day rhetoric
in Congress that focused on the amendment to allow the federal
government and the states to ban burning or otherwise defacing the
American flag.
   Beyond Washington, the flag marked its birthday by being raised,
praised, frozen and burned as the debate over the national symbol
rolled across America.
   _``Make Our Day _ Try And Burn These Flags, Pinkos,'' read the
sign in a Chicago parade. Elsewhere in the city, that's just what
some of them did. Members of the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade burned flags outside the Art Institute, where an exhibit
was shut down last year because of its controversial depiction of
the flag.
   _In Vermont, the state archivist suggested another amendment to
protect the flag. Gregory Sanford said the very federal law that
says how many stars and stripes must be on the flag should be
amended to require that the flag be made out of fireproof material.
That way if a flag catches fire, it's not a real one and doesn't
count, he said.
   _A California peace activist froze a flag in a cake tin and
displayed it to reporters as he called for a freeze in nuclear
weapons. ``I'm really burned up about this flag amendment,'' said
Jerry Rubin, who is not related to the more famous activist of the
same name.
   _In Pittsburgh, the observance was traditional as Boy Scouts
sang ``America The Beautiful,'' raised a flag and rang a replica of
the Liberty Bell.
   A 5-4 Supreme Court decision Monday scrapped last year's
statutory ban on flag burning, setting the stage for the drive to
amend the Constitution.
   The proposed amendment could be on the House floor as early as
next week.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee plans hearings next week and
sponsors say a floor vote could come before the Fourth of July,
although that is not certain.
   To become part of the Constitution, the measure would have to
get two-thirds support in both the House and Senate and win
ratification by 38 state legislatures.
   Flag Day furnished lawmakers with an occasion to give full vent
to their views on the highly charged issue.
   Far from rushing the measure, the Senate is moving too slowly,
said Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``We've already had hearings, we've been down that route, we
don't need any more hearings, we ought to bring the bill to the
floor ... let's have a vote,'' Dole said.
   He served as master of ceremonies for a rally at which veterans
in American Legion caps along with tourists wearing cameras on
straps swarmed over the Capitol lawn to hear partisans of the
amendment call for action.
   ``If they want to set their britches on fire, fine,'' Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, declared. ``Just don't set the symbol of the
freedom they claim allows them to protest on fire.''
   On the Senate floor, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said he was
dismayed to see a picture of Dole holding an American flag at the
White House and President Bush laughing.
   ``It's a great loss when the president of the United States is
doing this, pointing and laughing, laughing, using this moment,
taking political advantage,'' Kerrey said.
   ``I am ashamed of what he did.''
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., broke with conservative colleagues
to oppose the amendment. He told the Senate that whether the flag
should be honored is not the issue in the debate.
   ``What will be before our country is whether we should amend the
Constitution of the United States in such a way as to pare back the
Bill of Rights, whether the time has come to whittle away just a
little bit, and in one particular fashion, on the First Amendment
to the Constitution,'' he said.

<HEAD>Julian Bream Guitar Makes Record Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of
English classical guitarist Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100,
a world auction record for the instrument, Sotheby's said.
   The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday
by a Japanese dealer whose name was not available. The previous
record was $18,900, paid in 1974 for a south German guitar made in
1624.
   Acoustic guitars are the traditional models of the instrument
and they tend to wear out fairly quickly when used.
   Bream has said he plays his guitars for two years and then likes
to sell them for others to play.
   Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far
more money: one owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for
$322,000.
   The record guitar and five others sold by Bream Thursday brought
in a total of $56,100.

<HEAD>Fear of ``Mad Cow'' Disease Prompts Ban on British Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss authorities have imposed an
immediate ban on imports of British cattle and beef as a precaution
against ``mad cow'' disease.
   A government statement Thursday said the measure was designed to
prevent products banned from European Community markets being sold
to Switzerland, which is not a member of the 12-nation trading bloc.
   The Swiss ban includes all live cattle, beef on the bone, and
cattle feed made from animal by-products.
   ``Mad cow'' disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a
degenerative nervous disorder, has killed 13,000 cows in Britain
over the past four years. There is no proof that humans are at risk
from eating contaminated beef.
   France, Germany and Italy last week lifted bans on British beef
imports as part of an EC compromise. A meeting of EC farm ministers
agreed to limit British exports of live cattle to calves under six
months of age, and to introduce a certification system showing that
beef exports were from herds where no traces of the disease were
found in the past two years.

<HEAD>Improved X-Ray, Closer Baggage Scrutiny Ordered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Airlines will have to use better X-ray
machines and pay closer attention to checked-in luggage under new
federal directives responding to a presidential commission on
terrorism.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Federal Aviation
Administration chief James Busey announced several security steps
Thursday, including creation of two high-level posts to oversee
transportation security.
   Busey said airlines would be required to replace older,
less-sensitive X-ray machines with modern ones that have higher
detection standards for carry-on luggage. X-rays, however, cannot
detect plastic bombs.
   Metal detectors that passengers walk through also would have to
be upgraded under the new orders.
   Airlines flying outside the United States will have to further
inspect checked-in luggage and match it to passengers, and will be
required to report to the FAA any threat that could affect U.S.
civil aviation.
   ``Taken together, these initiatives represent building blocks in
a system that will justify even higher levels of passenger
confidence in the safety of air travel, already our safest mode of
transportation,'' Skinner said.
   But the announcement did not address several key recommendations
in the May report by the panel that investigated government
response to aviation terrorism. Skinner said other proposals still
are being examined.
   The commission looking into the deaths of 270 people in the
December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, called for ``major reforms'' in government security
operations. It said the Lockerbie bombing ``may well have been
preventable.''
   The seven-member panel proposed preemptive and retaliatory
military strikes against terrorists, a system to notify passengers
of credible terrorist threats and other steps to avert terrorist
strikes both in the United States and abroad.
   FAA Administrator Busey said he would convene a government team
of researchers, security specialists, engineers and explosives
experts to recommend ``an integrated security research and
development program'' to be implemented by Sept. 1.
   An FAA program to install sophisticated bomb detectors at 150
high-risk airports around the world has been stalled since the
commission report. The panel recommended that it be set aside so
more-effective methods of detecting plastic explosives can be
explored.
   The Transportation Department's new Office of Intelligence and
Security will oversee all transportation security efforts. It will
be headed by Vice Adm. Clyde E. Robbins, who will leave his post as
commander of the Coast Guard's Pacific area and Maritime Defense
Zone.
   A new post of FAA assistant administrator for civil aviation
security also is being created, but no appointee was announced.
   Former Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, who headed the
presidential commission, said Thursday she was ``very encouraged''
by the initial actions.
   ``They're doing what they can to make the kinds of changes we
all know are necessary,'' she said.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a commission member, also praised
the actions.
   He said he is working on legislation that would meet some other
commission goals: federal security managers at domestic airports,
tighter controls on cargo, better training of airport personnel and
compensation for terrorism victims.
   None of those items was addressed in Skinner's actions.
   Another panel member, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said the
response was a ``good start,'' but he urged appointment of FAA
security managers at key airports right away ``because we cannot
allow the present system to continue.''
   The commission, which had a budget of $1 million, was officially
dissolved today.

<HEAD>Army Decides Beetle Bailey is Funny, Salutes His Creator</HEAD>

   For 40 years, the Army grumbled about Pvt.
Beetle Bailey. He's a real misfit, they said. Lazy. No spit and
polish. Drives the Sarge nuts. He'll never make corporal. Let him
peel potatoes forever.
   Then one fine day, somebody in the Pentagon with silver stars on
his shoulders looked around the table and told the men with silver
eagles on their shirt collars: Hey, you know, the little guy's
funny.
   Yes, sir! they all replied, nodding in unison.
   And so it was that an incredulous Mort Walker, a cartoonist who
once slogged through the mud at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., as an Army
draftee in World War II, was ushered into the Pentagon on Thursday
and given a hero's welcome.
   Walker, who created the Beetle Bailey comic strip in 1950, could
hardly believe it. For years, he had braved the Army's fire when
Beetle and the gang _ Zero, Sgt. Snorkel, Lt. Fuzz, Gen. Halftrack
_ did something foolish.
   On Thursday, he blinked before TV lights in the Pentagon
briefing room. Generals slapped him on the back, praised him to the
skies and asked for his autograph. One of them gave Walker a framed
``Certificate of Appreciation for Patriotic Civilian Service'' with
a ribbon in red, white and blue.
   The war was over.
   ``I can't believe I'm actually here,'' Walker said, ``As hard as
it is to find anything in the Pentagon, they finally found a sense
of humor.''
   ``Through it all, you have entertained us, although sometimes we
haven't always liked it,'' said Brig Gen. Bill McClain, the Army's
public affairs chief.
   McClain confessed that he reads Beetle Bailey ``and I laugh at
it, and others do, too.''
   Maj. Gen. Richard E. Stephenson said, ``Beetle Bailey is the
vehicle that enables us to see the lighter side of our profession
and keeps us from taking ourselves too seriously.''
   The Army brass wasn't always that charitable. They thought the
strip presented an unflattering image of Army life, that Beetle was
a poor role model for modern GIs.
   The Tokyo edition of The Stars and Stripes military newspaper
drummed Beetle off its pages in 1954 because the strip poked fun at
officers, although the official explanation was that ``Beetle
Bailey had a low interest value.''
   Stars and Stripes banned the strip again in 1970, as did some
Southern newspapers, when Walker introduced a feisty black
character named Lt. Flap who complained about Sarge's ``honky
outfit.'' Feminists protested Miss Buxley, the bosomy secretary to
Gen. Halftrack.
   All was forgiven Thursday. The citation said Walker's
``ingenuity in portraying Army members in a humorous manner has
contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they
provide for our national security.''
   The cartoonist also joined the generals in the Pentagon's
sun-splashed inner courtyard to watch a cake-cutting ceremony
marking the 215th birthday of the Army.
   Walker gave Army officials a diorama based on his special Flag
Day cartoon, which appeared Thursday in the more than 1,800
newspapers worldwide that carry the syndicated Beetle Bailey strip.
The diorama will hang permanently in a hallway near the Pentagon's
main entrance.
   Two life-size Beetle and Sarge figures who accompanied Walker
roamed the corridors waving to Pentagon secretaries and exchanged
salutes from passing generals and admirals.
   McClain, the Army public affairs boss, summed up the situation:
``If you can't laugh at yourself, something is intrinsically wrong
with you.''

<HEAD>Sobriety Checkpoints Get Green Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in many states have a green light to
use sobriety checkpoints to combat drunken driving, but some _
including a Supreme Court justice _ say that tactic will not work.
   The high court on Thursday upheld Michigan's checkpoint program
and, by extension, similar operations in most states.
   Critics say checkpoints, where all motorists heading in one
direction are pulled over and detained briefly, are not as
efficient as other methods used by police to catch drunken drivers
or keep them off the road.
   ``We must begin to assure that every community will make
checkpoints a key element of an all-out campaign to finally rid our
roads of the menace posed by drinking drivers,'' said Micky Sadoff,
national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   ``We know that checkpoints are one of the most effective weapons
to combat drunk driving,'' she added.
   Brian O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a
research group funded by the insurance industry, agreed.
``Checkpoints are a very effective way of creating deterrents,'' he
said. ``We can never catch all the drunks, so what we have to do is
create programs to deter the offenders.''
   But Nadine Strossen, general counsel of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said police sobriety checkpoints not only trample
constitutionally protcted privacy rights but are ineffective.
   ``There's not a smidgen of evidence that these tactics are more
effective than the traditional, constitutional method used by
police officers _ to observe traffic and stop those cars that raise
suspicions,'' she said.
   ``Its more effective to use the same number of cops to watch
traffic in areas where drunk driving has been a problem, and have
them look for those who might be under the influence,'' Ms.
Strossen said.
   The high court's vote Thursday was 6-3, and one of the
dissenters discounted the effect checkpoints have had or will have
on drunken driving.
   ``Sobriety checkpoints are elaborate, and disquieting, publicity
stunts,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said. Quoting various
statistics from federal studies, he concluded, ``The net effect of
sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is infinitesimal, and
possibly negative.''
   The court ruling will have no effect in at least one state.
Police in Louisiana are barred from setting up sobriety checkpoints
by their state constitution, which affords greater individual
privacy than does the federal Constitution.
   And police in Michigan may have to wait to reinstate their
checkpoint program. State courts had invalidated it for violating
the federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which bans
unreasonable police searches and seizures.
   Now the state courts must resolve a challenge based on the
Michigan Constitution.
   In other decisions Thursday, the justices:
   _Ruled, 5-4, in a Virginia case that hospitals and nursing homes
may sue in federal court to challenge how a state-run Medicaid
program reimburses their costs.
   _Decided unanimously in a case from Massachusetts that the
federal government may impose severe fines against air polluters
even when regulators are slow to decide on clean-air proposals.
   _Allowed the Bush administration, by a 5-4 vote in a Virginia
case, to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive.

<HEAD>British Comedian Elsie Waters Dead at 95</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elsie Waters, who with her sister formed a wartime
radio comedy duo that was regarded as a national institution, has
died, The Times of London reported today. She was 95.
   No cause of her death Thursday was given.
   Elsie and Doris Waters, daughters of a London funeral furnisher
who made coffin linings and shrouds, performed together for more
than 50 years. They were favorites of Winston Churchill and had
elephants named after them at the London Zoo.
   The characters of Gert and Daisy, a pair of Cockney gossips,
were created by accident when Elsie and Doris needed material for
the flip side of a 78 rpm record. Previously considered a musical
act, they wrote a comic dialogue between two women watching a posh
wedding.
   In 1929, the sisters went before a radio microphone. Their
characters, who conveyed the feelings and frustrations of ordinary
people with humor but not vulgarity, were an immediate hit on
radio's Saturday Night Music Hall.
   The act reached its peak of popularity during World War II, when
it played an important role in sustaining national morale.
   The sisters often entertained the wounded in hospitals, and made
several visits to entertain forces overseas _ provoking complaints
that they were off the air too long.
   After one of these tours, Elsie remarked to a taxi driver that
she was used to going around with an armed escort.
   ``Blimey, what have you got to protect?'' he replied. That went
straight into their next script.
   The sisters never retired, and when they were well into their
70s they enjoyed a new popularity. Their final appearance came a
few months before Doris died in 1978.
   Elsie never married and lived with her sister for more than 30
years.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Greenpeace activists chained themselves
to a cross-Channel ferry carrying radioactive waste to Britain,
preventing the ship from sailing for 13 hours.
   After daylong negotiations with regional authorities Thursday,
the 15 activists finally left the Nord-Pas-de-Calais ferry at
night. Other activists in inflatable dinghies around the ferry also
left, allowing the ship to sail to Dover.
   The ship, which transports rail cars, was carrying one filled
with radioactive waste from a nuclear power plant at Unterweser,
West Germany, authorities said.
   Greenpeace, the environmental group, said the shipment was bound
for the Sellafield waste treatment facility in northern England.
The group said that transporting the waste across the busy shipping
lane was a risk to the environment.

<TEXT>
   Fighting roosters are bred to kill and
die in a flurry of talons, spurs and feathers, but 65 of the birds
soon may be sent to their deaths by lawyers.
   Maine officials want a judge to permit them to destroy the birds
seized two months ago in a raid. But they are being hampered by the
legal novelty of the case in Maine, which isn't often the site of
cockfights, officials said.
   ``This is a new process that we haven't dealt with a great
deal,'' said Clyde F. LeClair, director of the state Animal Welfare
Board. ``We haven't had this in a long time, long before my time.''
   ``It's the first case in the state that I know of,'' said Janet
T. Mills, the Androscoggin County district attorney.
   The roosters were seized April 14 at a property in rural Wales,
about 50 miles north of Portland. They were first taken to an
animal shelter in nearby Wiscasset, then transferred to their
current quarters at the University of Maine in Orono.
   Bert Langelier, owner of the property where the birds were
seized, faces a felony animal fighting charge, Mills said Thursday.
Twenty other adults who were rounded up at the cockfight have
pleaded guilty to misdemeanors.
   But at a hearing last month, Auburn Superior Judge Thomas E.
Delahanty II refused the state's petition to destroy the birds,
saying that Langelier has said he wants to take care of them.
   The birds must be stored in 65 separate cages at all times or
they will kill each other, officials said. If the birds so much as
look at each other, they go into a frenzy and try to escape their
cages.
   ``They're very difficult animals to deal with,'' Mills said.
``From what I understand, they're bred and raised only for fighting
and killing other animals.''
   The state said it would seek permission at a hearing June 26 to
destroy the birds.
   Langelier, whose home telephone is unlisted, could not be
reached to comment.

<TEXT>
   Authorities captured four more fugitive
members of a West German terrorist squad in East Germany, the
government news agency ADN said Friday.
   The arrests bring to six the number of reputed West German
terrorists arrested the past 10 days in East Germany, where
authorities said they were allowed to live by the former Communist
government.
   All six are said to be key members of the Red Army Faction, a
violent left-wing group that claimed credit for a series of
bombings and murders of prominent businessmen in West Germany
during the 1970s and '80s.
   A reputed terrorist wanted in West Germany for 13 years was
reported Thursday to have told police that East Germany gave her a
phony identity and let her build a new life.
   Her statement to authorities was reported by East Germany's
interior minister, who has pledged to cooperate with West Germany
in tracking down terrorists shielded by the old Communist
government.
   Susanne Albrecht, one of West Germany's most wanted terrorist
suspects, was sought in the 1977 shooting death of a top West
German banker. She was arrested June 6 outside her East Berlin
apartment.
   Officials on Wednesday arrested another reputed West German
terrorist, Inge Viett, who had been living in the East German city
of Magdeburg.
   Ms. Viett, wanted in several terrorist attacks dating to 1972,
told East German authorities she was willing to cooperate and had
renounced terrorism, said the East German interior minister,
Peter-Michael Diestel.
   Both women are believed to be prominent members of the left-wing
Red Army Faction.
   Both women had been living in East Germany under assumed names.
   Diestel said Thursday that Ms. Albrecht, in the police
statement, said she was set up with a new identity by the Stasi,
the feared secret police of the old Communist government.
   She said she was sent by the terrorist group to live in East
Germany in 1979 because she believed she posed a security risk
after the 1977 slaying of Dresdener Bank's president, Juergen
Ponto, outside Frankfurt.
   However, Diestel said Ms. Albrecht never admitted a role in any
terrorist activities and did not refer to the Red Army Faction by
name, saying only that she worked with an anti-imperialist
organization.
   She said she later met with a contact for the secret police in
East Germany, Diestel said.
   She said she was informed that the East German government
disapproved of the group's methods but agreed with its
anti-imperialist objectives, the interior minister said.
   Both Ms. Albrecht and Ms. Viett are being held pending expected
extradition proceedings to West Germany.
   Diestel said it was ``speculation'' whether there were other
terrorists hiding in East Germany, but said: ``Whoever goes into
the forest and finds two mushrooms will continue to search.''
   Western officials have long contended that the former Communist
government either endorsed, trained or condoned leftist terrorism.
   The Stasi, one of the most skilled and feared intelligence
networks in the world, is believed to have trained the secret
services of several other countries, including those linked to
terrorism.
   Diestel has come under fire in recent months for keeping
hundreds of former Stasi agents in the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for domestic law enforcement.
   West German officials said that news of Ms. Albrecht's
whereabouts came from a tip by a former Stasi member.
   West German officials also received a tip in 1986 that Ms. Viett
was living in East Germany and passed it on to the former Communist
government.
   However, the East Germans took no action against Ms. Viett, said
Christiane Kleinschmidt, a spokesman for the West German federal
prosecutor's office in Wiesbaden, West Germany.
   Ms. Viett's involvement in terrorism goes back to 1972, when she
allegedly took part in a bombing that killed one man at a boating
facility in Berlin.
   West German authorities have accused Ms. Viett of also taking
part in the murder of a West Berlin judge, Guenter von Drenkmann,
in 1974.

<HEAD>Native Alaskan Communities Endorsing Temperance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temperance movement is making gains
in Alaska's Native communities.
   More than 100 villages with large Eskimo, Indian or Aleut
populations have approved alcohol restrictions since 1980, when the
Legislature began enacting laws letting communities ban the sale,
importation or possession of alcohol.
   ``Sobriety is not a dirty word any longer. ... There is a real
spirit in the community that supports change,'' said Carla Bonney,
health director for 800 Athabascan Indians living in or near the
village of Tanana, 130 miles west of Fairbanks.
   But temperance laws alone don't eliminate alcohol use.
Bootlegging usually is rampant in remote areas where ``dry''
villages abut ``wet'' villages, authorities say.
   Statistics bear out the extent of Alaska's alcohol problem:
   _The state is third, behind New Hampshire and Nevada, in
per-capita alcohol consumption, says the National Institute for
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The institute says Alaskans drink the
equivalent of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per person each year,
compared with the national average of 2.88 gallons.
   _Alaska has twice the national average of accidental deaths, and
70 percent are alcohol-related, according to a 1982 state report.
   _Suicide rates in rural Alaska quadrupled during the past decade
and doubled in urban areas. State officials believe 80 percent of
suicide deaths are alcohol-related.
   _The Alaska Judicial Council in 1980 linked 100 percent of rural
murders, 80 percent of violent felonies and 56 percent of property
crimes to alcohol.
   Alcohol problems are often most acute among Natives _ an
estimated 30,000 Eskimos, 5,000 Aleuts and 15,000 Indians _ who
make up about 10 percent of Alaska's 500,000 population.
   Nearly half of all Native communities have voted for alcohol
restrictions: 72 villages prohibit the sale and importation of
liquor, 21 have outright bans on possession, and 11 others have
either banned sales of liquor or restricted sales to community-run
or package liquor outlets.
   The sobriety movement once was limited mainly to urban areas
because that's where the state's social-service agencies operated,
but now it's spreading to the countryside, said George Mundell,
regional program coordinator for the state Office of Alcoholism and
Drug Abuse.
   In some cases, whole villages are living an alcohol-free life,
he said.
   ``More and more, there's an awareness and understanding that
folks can get ahead of these alcohol problems and that they are
preventable,'' Mundell said.
   Theresa ``Tiny'' Devlin of the Alaska Federation of Natives,
which set up a commission in 1988 to study alcohol abuse among
Natives, said the temperance campaign is ``starting to really
blossom.''
   In Tanana, tribal leaders and village officials have worked
together to tackle alcohol problems, Bonney said. One-third of the
profits from a state-licensed liquor store in the village goes to
the tribal government for alcohol programs.
   Liquor store receipts in Tanana dropped 40 percent last year
over the previous year, and the number of alcohol-related accidents
has fallen dramatically, Bonney said.
   Bootlegging and moonshining, however, remain overwhelming
problems in remote areas, said Roy Minatra, an investigator for the
Alaska State Troopers' bureau of drug enforcement.
   In the western Alaska community of Kotzebue, where the sale of
liquor is banned, a bottle of rum goes for $80. In Bethel, a bottle
of whiskey would fetch about $65.
   The drug-enforcement bureau has assigned two investigators to
deal with drug and alcohol law enforcement among 160 villages in
western Alaska. And state troopers are aggressively promoting a
year-old reward system to persuade villagers to turn in liquor-law
violators for cash.
   As much as $250,000 is on offer, but so far there have been few
takers because the program is little-known, officials say.
   The emphasis on Prohibition-style laws is not without its
critics.
   ``Prohibition doesn't work,'' said Bonney. ``It didn't work for
the U.S. in the 1920s. If people want to drink, they are going to
find a way.''
   She said lasting change will come only when young people are
educated about the dangers of alcohol abuse and whole communities
change their attitudes.

<TEXT>
   A smoking ban at a heart-lung center
has severely curtailed the profits of the hospital's weekly bingo
game.
   ``We had people tell us that `if I can't smoke, I'm done. Then
they stopped coming,''' said William Lang, organizer of the
fund-raising game at Deborah Heart and Lung Center.
   The center banned smoking in September. Since then, profits that
once went as high as $600 a week have dropped to as low as $5 a
week.
   Bingo once generated up to $25,000 for the center, which
provides diagnosis and treatment of heart, lung and vascular
disease.
   The center has no intention of backing off the no-smoking
policy, center spokeswoman Lorraine Ryan said. That has bingo
organizers looking for a building where smoking is allowed, Lang
said. Or the game may be dropped as a fund-raiser.

   Warren Beatty came to town for the
10-screen premiere of his film ``Dick Tracy'' on Thursday, but
co-stars Al Pacino and Madonna missed the opening at Walt Disney
World.
   The Touchstone Pictures movie based on the famous comic strip
opens at theaters nationwide Friday. It features Beatty in the
title role, Pacino as villain Big Boy Caprice and Madonna as the
vixen Breathless Mahoney.
   Joining Beatty at the private premiere screening were Dustin
Hoffman, who plays the character Mumbles, and Glenne Headley, who
plays Tess Truehart.
   The film was set up for simultaneous showings on 10 screens for
about 3,000 invited guests, said theater general manager Hal
Garrett.
   The stars attended a round of parties at the Disney-MGM Studios
but made no public appearances. Would-be star gazers lost out
because no one was allowed near the theater complex.
   Also new at the studio-tourist park is a nightly musical stage
show based on ``Dick Tracy.''

<HEAD>Political Turmoil In Former Colonies Poses Dilemma For France</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   France, long proud of its unmatched commitment to
black Africa, now is groping for the proper response to a wave of
protests against undemocratic regimes that it has helped sustain.
   While democratization in Eastern Europe was welcomed
unreservedly by the West, Africa poses a policy dilemma without
clear solutions.
   France, with its own revolutionary heritage, will not repudiate
the intensifying cries for change in Gabon, the Ivory Coast,
Cameroon and other former colonies. Yet there are worries in Paris
that the abrupt ouster of incumbent regimes _ even if corrupt or
repressive _ might unleash ethnic strife and economic chaos without
ensuring progress toward democracy.
   French officials insist they will not walk away from the
problem, and there is much talk about discreetly nudging current
leaders in the direction of reform. Several presidents, for the
first time, are at least paying lip service to the concept of
multiparty elections.
   But to some critics, France's discretion is merely covering up a
lack of strategy.
   ``Across the continent, tumultuous situations require new
ideas,'' said the independent Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique,
or Young Africa. ``France is wooed by the governments and the
opposition. But for the first time, its African policy seems to
have broken down.''
   ``If France perhaps knows what it wants, it doesn't know how to
achieve it,'' said the magazine, one of several in Paris to devote
recent cover stories to francophone Africa's turmoil.
   ``We must say that we will no longer blindly support compliant
dictatorships,'' said Jacques Barrot, an opposition leader in the
centrist United Democratic Front. ``If we don't quickly state this
policy, we soon will have no alternatives except repeated military
interventions or abandoning Africa to chaos and misery.''
   Recent riots in Gabon gave France a glimpse of what might lie
ahead. Anti-government protesters briefly abducted a French
diplomat, and French soldiers who soon arrived were widely viewed
as propping up President Omar Bongo, despite official insistence
that their only task was to protect European expatriates.
   Both Bongo and the Ivory Coast's octogenarian president, Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, have treaties providing for French troops to
support their governments during internal strife as well as against
foreign incursions.
   But French officials say there is little likelihood now of
direct military intervention, either on behalf of an African leader
or against one _ such as ``Operation Barracuda'' of 1979 when
French troops helped topple the Central African Republic's
self-proclaimed emperor, Jean-Bedel Bokassa.
   ``The post-colonial period is over,'' said Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas. ``It's up to Africans to resolve their problems.''
   Other former colonial powers _ Britain, Portugal and Belgium _
have invested less of their international prestige in the
continent, and have not emulated France's familial relationships
with African leaders.
   Ironically, the United States _ never an African colonizer _
faces dilemmas similar to the French in Liberia and Zaire,
recipients of extensive U.S. aid.
   American diplomats have urged authoritarian Presidents Mobutu
Sese Seko of Zaire and Samuel K. Doe of Liberia to allow political
pluralism, but neither Zaire's fragmented opposition nor Liberian
rebel leader Charles Taylor has obtained formal backing in
Washington.
   In France, Socialist President Francois Mitterrand has a
longstanding reputation as an advocate of Third World interests,
but some critics say European affairs now preoccupy him at Africa's
expense.
   He will be under pressure to convey a clear-cut message on human
rights when he plays host to the biennial Franco-African summit
meeting June 19-21.
   More than 25 African leaders, many facing emboldened domestic
opposition, are expected at the summit in La Baule, a resort on
Brittany's Coast of Love. But the summit may prove less than
amorous, with the Africans demanding more debt relief while France
lectures them on democracy.
   Cooperation Minister Jacques Pelletier, who oversees French aid
to Africa, summarized current government thinking at a news
conference last week: ``There is no true development without
genuine democracy.''
   But he said multiparty systems, while ``a good thing,'' are
``not the only method'' for attaining democracy.
   A more blunt assessment came from former Premier Jacques Chirac,
a conservative. Multiparty politics, he said, ``is a sort of
luxury'' that developing countries ``don't have the ability to
provide themselves.''
   Last year's upheavals in Eastern Europe galvanized Africa's
political dissidents. So did the dramatic changes in South Africa,
long a favorite target of indignation from black African leaders.
   ``When the ``Great Satan'' of South Africa legalizes its
opposition and frees its worst enemies, the second-rate dictators
elsewhere find themselves very much alone,'' said the leftist Paris
daily, Liberation.
   Africa's political turmoil coincides with bleak economic
conditions _ unmanageable foreign debt, falling export income,
population growth exceeding food production. French businesses are
looking elsewhere for profits that are more reliable and less
tainted by corruption.
   Pelletier says the number of French firms in Africa has dropped
by 25 percent from its peak. Many companies are eyeing Eastern
Europe as a preferable venue.
   France currently provides more than $2.5 billion annually in
bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa, compared to $893 million
allocated by the United States for the coming year.
   More than 125,000 French expatriates live in the region,
hundreds of French firms operate there, and 14 countries base their
currency on the franc. France has persisted in backing some
currencies so doggedly that several are overvalued by 30 to 50
percent, inhibiting serious economic reforms.
   France has defense treaties with six sub-Saharan countries and
deploys about 6,600 soldiers there.

   Rock legend Bo Diddley said his
counterpart in two television commercials, sports star Bo Jackson,
really doesn't know diddly about playing the guitar.
   ``It's just like you see in the movies. The guitar player who
was with us was almost like a stunt man,'' Diddley said. ``It just
looks like he's playing that guitar, just like it looks like I'm
shooting pool. They had me shooting pool, but I can't shoot pool.''
   The first Nike ad, initially aired during the 1989 baseball
All-Star Game, showed Jackson playing several sports and a
superstar in each sport saying things like, ``Bo knows basketball.''
   Then, on a stage with Diddley and his famous box-shaped guitar,
Jackson tried to play a guitar, but Diddley told him, ``Bo, you
don't know diddly.''
   A few months later, Nike came back with a second ad with shots
of Jackson and Diddley in a variety of leisure pursuits. It ends
with Jackson supposedly playing guitar and Diddley saying the
athlete does know diddly after all.
   Diddley said the second ad gives the impression that time has
passed since the first ad, but both were shot at the same time.
   ``It's all just show business,'' he told the Birmingham
Post-Herald.

   When Tammy Chamberlain wrote a letter
to talk-show host Gary Collins, she didn't expect a reply _ much
less a personal visit.
   The host of ABC's ``The Home Show'' was to do a portion of
today's show live from this small southwestern Michigan town.
   ``I didn't think the letter was that big a deal,'' said
Chamberlain, the city's official hostess.
   In the letter, Chamberlain told how the recent shutdown of a
General Motors Corp. plant hit the town hard. She said Three
Rivers' 7,000 residents needed a morale boost as they prepared for
their 34th annual Water Festival.
   Chamberlain said she was stunned when Collins called her on his
live show June 4 to tell her he would be coming.
   ``In my wildest dreams I never thought he'd come,'' she said.
``This is big news here.''
   Collins thought the visit might be the beginning of an
``outreach program to American towns that are going through hard
times,'' said Paul Nichols, Collins' publicist.

   Tennis star Chris Evert was named to
head a new drug treatment and education program for pregnant women.
   Gov. Bob Martinez appointed Evert to the Clean Start program
Thursday.
   ``We are joining forces to try to make a difference between a
healthy baby and a baby who is born addicted to cocaine,'' Evert
said at an appearance with the governor.
   The seven-time No. 1-ranked tennis player will appear in public
service announcements urging pregnant women to protect themselves
and their unborn children by not using drugs.
   About 40 percent of the $1 million funding for the new program
will come from Evert's annual tennis tournament, the Chris
Evert-Phar-Mor Pro-Celebrity Classic, scheduled for Oct. 13 and 14
in Boca Raton.
   The remaining 60 percent will be provided by the state and the
Ounce of Prevention program, a public-private partnership funding
innovative abuse prevention programs.
   The state Department of Health of Rehabilitative Services
estimates 10,450 babies _ 5.5 percent of all births _ were born
addicted to cocaine last year in Florida.

   Pop singer Madonna has canceled her concert
tonight in Philadelphia and might bow out of the Saturday and
Sunday shows as well.
   Throat problems have forced Madonna to cancel two other shows in
the past three weeks. She said only that she was under doctor's
orders to cancel tonight's show, said Jim Sutcliffe of Electric
Factory Concerts, the Philadelphia-area promoter for Madonna's
``Blond Ambition'' tour.
   He said a final decision on the Saturday and Sunday shows would
come by Saturday morning.
   The Friday night concert at the Spectrum was sold out; refund
arrangements for the 14,000 fans will be announced later, Sutcliffe
said.

   A college student honored in her home county
as the Dairy Princess was convicted Thursday of murder for
strangling another young woman in a quarrel over a man they both
dated.
   Jurors deliberated about 7{ hours before returning the verdict
against Lori Esker, 20. The charge carries a mandatory sentence of
life in prison.
   In closing arguments, prosecutors said Ms. Esker of Hatley
planned to kill 21-year-old Lisa Cihaski. The defense said the
slaying was self-defense.
   Defense attorney Stephen Glynn asked jurors to reject
prosecution assertions the killing was premeditated.
   ``If you use your logic, use your common sense, you are going to
find reasonable doubt,'' Glynn said.
   But prosecutors disagreed, saying the length of time Ms. Esker
had to hold a belt around Ms. Cihaski's throat before she died _ 2
to 8 minutes _ proved Ms. Esker intended to kill her.
   Jurors began deliberations late in the afternoon after Marathon
County Circuit Judge Michael Hoover spent an hour giving the panel
final instructions.
   The closing arguments ended a weeklong trial during which the
prosecution portrayed Ms. Esker _ a successful student and 1989
Marathon County Dairy Princess _ as a spurned lover obsessed with
winning back her former boyfriend, dairy farmer Bill Buss, 26.
   District Attorney Greg Grau said Ms. Esker was so obsessed with
Buss that she plotted, then killed Ms. Cihaski, 21, of Birnamwood.
   In tearful testimony early in the trial, Buss told jurors he had
ended a one-year relationship with Ms. Esker and began dating Ms.
Cihaski, whom he planned to marry.
   The farmer said Ms. Esker twice sneaked into his home and tried
to seduce him after their breakup. He said he spurned both advances.
   Ms. Esker allegedly drove 150 miles from the University of
Wisconsin-River Falls, where she was a student, created a false
alibi, then killed Ms. Cihaski during an argument in a hotel
parking lot.
   Glynn said that when a fight broke out, Ms. Esker used a belt to
defend herself. Her lack of a weapon deflated prosecution arguments
the killing was pre-planned, he said.
   During Thursday's proceedings, Ms. Esker wiped away tears and
looked down at the table in front of her, frequently scribbling on
a yellow legal pad.

<HEAD>Science Journal Suggests Fraud Possible In Texas A&amp;M Cold Fusion
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas A&amp;M University experiments may have been
intentionally contaminated to get results that proved cold fusion,
a prominent science journal said in a report published today.
   Despite widespread rumor that the A&amp;M cold fusion results were
manipulated, university officials have yet to conduct a formal
investigation, according to Science, a widely read journal
published by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
   ``The result is that after a year of experiments that most
scientists view with a great deal of skepticism anyway, the A&amp;M
researchers are still haunted by this specter of possible fraud,''
the journal said.
   John Fackler, dean of the College of Science at A&amp;M, said he has
no evidence of fraud and no plans to investigate the cold fusion
experiments.
   ``I have no concrete evidence of anything other than possibly
fairly sloppy chemistry,'' he said in an interview.
   Cold fusion experiments in the A&amp;M laboratory of John Bockris
last year were among the first in the world to report finding
tritium, a form of hydrogen that can be key evidence of a fusion
reaction.
   Fusion is the merger of hydrogen atoms into helium with the
release of substantial energy. It is the principal reaction of the
sun and of thermonuclear weapons, and is believed by most
scientists to require hydrogen atoms to be compressed and heated to
millions of degrees.
   ``Cold'' fusion, in which the reaction would take place and
liberate energy as heat at ordinary temperatures, would be a
stunning and unexplained scientific breakthrough.
   Bockris reported the tritium within weeks after Stanley Pons at
the University of Utah, and his colleague Martin Fleischmann,
announced to a stunned scientific community that they had achieved
fusion in a laboratory jar.
   The Utah announcement set off a worldwide scramble to confirm
the possibility of cold fusion, but most experimenters could not
duplicate the Pons-Fleischmann results and the concept now has few
supporters among scientists.
   The journal Science said A&amp;M's quick findings of tritium gave
early support of the Pons-Fleischmann findings, and were
instrumental in a decision by the state of Utah to invest $5
million in cold fusion research. A&amp;M, the magazine said, received
an additional $150,000 from the Electric Power Research Institute.
   Yet, Science said, ``suspicions were raised almost from the
first that the tritium in the A&amp;M cells (experiments) was put there
by human hands.''
   Bockris declined to comment and other members of his staff
referred questions to university officials. One member of his
research group, doctoral candidate Nigel Packham, told Science he
and Bockris were not ready to abandon their results.
   The magazine said some scientists had suggested the tritium
detected in the A&amp;M experiments was a result of someone
deliberately ``spiking'' the chemical analysis.
   Science said Bockris and his team reported finding tritium on
numerous occasions _ including six different experiments in one
week _ while scores of other laboratories around the country could
find nothing, or reported tritium at levels of only a fraction of
that reported by A&amp;M.
   The magazine said that although suspicions of fraud arose,
Bockris did not act on suggestions by colleagues to secure the
experimental apparatus and protect it from tampering.
   ``Although the origin of Bockris's tritium may not be resolved
for years, the tritium episode has become a case study in the
damage done when questions of fraud, legitimately raised, are not
seriously addressed by either the lab chief or his institution,''
Science said.
   The journal article also said the A&amp;M case ``raises crucial
questions about how rumors and allegations of fraud should be
investigated while ensuring academic freedom and protecting the
reputations of scientists.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Pluralistic Winds Reach Africa</HEAD>

   For years, the conventional wisdom about
African countries was that they were not well-suited for political
pluralism. Under democracy, political parties would be formed along
tribal instead of nationalist lines. Africans were better off under
one-party rule.
   Or so it was thought.
   Such notions are becoming increasingly anachronistic these days
as more and more African governments, faced with restive
populations, are tinkering with multi-party systems.
   It used to be that the handful of democratic countries _
Senegal, Gambia, Mauritius and Botswana _ were considered the odd
men out, curiosities on a continent of presidents for life and
predatory military establishments. They now seem to be in the
vanguard of a continent-wide movement.
   Conservative authoritarians such as the Ivory Coast's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny as well as leftist ideologues like Benin's Mathieu
Kerekou have legalized opposition parties. A variety of other
nations, including Gabon, Zaire, Zambia and Tanzania, seem to be
following suit. In Islamic North Africa, Algeria this week held its
first free elections in the country's 28 years of independence.
   Nigeria, which has been under military rule for 20 of its 30
years of independence, is embarked on transition to democratic rule.
   The political ferment is partly an outgrowth of what happened
last year in Eastern Europe.
   ``The wind that is blowing in the east should not stop in the
south,'' says Jacques Pelletier, France's minister for cooperation
and development. The same wind has been blowing from Latin America,
where a stampede to democracy took place over the past decade.
   ``Wisdom comes at 60,'' said Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko after
announcing in April that he would allow two additional parties to
compete for power. Mobutu reportedly had his change of heart after
seeing on television the blood-splattered remains of his one-time
friend and colleague, Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed
last December.
   Kwadwo O. Akpan, who heads the Washington-based Angola Peace
Fund, debunks the notion that single-party rule has minimized
ethnic rivalries.
   ``The leaders of these states are very often perceived to have
permanently installed members of their `in group' as leaders of the
party and therefore as rulers of the country,'' Akpan says.
   Accordingly, he says, ``the government's policies and its
pretense of being representative are seen by the vast majority as
being false.''
   As in Eastern Europe, the success of Africa's experiment in
pluralism is still in doubt because the continent's democratic
roots do not run deep. Few, however, underestimate the problems
associated with the strongman rule most Africans have endured for
the past generation.
   Chester Crocker, the Reagan administration's top official for
African affairs, traces Africa's political transformation to
``shocking economic decline'' as well as the ``widespread absence
of political accountability, raw abuse of power, rampant nepotism
and corruption and the suppression of non-government
organizations.''
   Crocker says that when Africa's independence process began in
the 1960s, Westerners were far too indulgent of the dictatorial
regimes that emerged.
   ``We Westerners acted as if it would be unfair, impolite or
downright dangerous to expect African systems of governance to meet
universal norms,'' he says.
   South Africa's Nelson Mandela, who arrives here next week, is at
the center of what could be a revolutionary democratic change away
from the country's discredited apartheid system.
   Last March, Namibia became independent from South Africa. With
timely help from the United Nations, Namibians have managed to
avoid the one-party misrule so evident elsewhere in Africa. Namibia
began independent life as few countries on the continent have _
with an elected government, an independent judiciary and numerous
curbs on executive power.
   There is another contrast: whites, instead of being expelled,
are being encouraged to remain in Namibia. Key ministerial posts
have gone to whites.
   One of Africa's most noteworthy holdouts against democratization
is Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, whose Kenya Africa National
Union has brought stability as well as prosperity.
   ``We are being asked to risk that which we have so painstakingly
built in order to lead up to some generalized, universal
prescription of political behavior,'' Moi has said.

<HEAD>Competition Seen Heated for U.S. Farm Products in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Europe could be an important new
market for agricultural products in a few years, but an Agriculture
Department analyst predicts the competition will be fierce.
   ``These countries are already aiming to join in world trade as
full partners and extend liberalized access to their market,'' said
Miles Lambert of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Competition for Eastern European market shares is already
gearing up, with the European Economic Community having an
advantage because of its proximity. Also, he said, some EEC members
``are resuming traditional special relationships'' with some of the
eastern countries.
   Notably, these include West Germany with Czechoslovakia and
Hungary, and France with Romania.
   Lambert, writing in the July issue of AgExporter magazine, said
Eastern Europe will be attractive to the EEC ``as a region in which
to market surplus farm output.''
   ``However,'' he added, the relatively high costs of (EEC)
farming and low near-term purchasing power of East Europeans means
the EEC will probably need to resort to export subsidies to
undercut the competition.''
   The United States is pushing for a reduction or elimination of
trade-distorting national policies, including export subsidies,
during the current Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Export subsidies, particularly by the EEC, have been a sore
point for many years in the United States, which has been using a
subsidy program of its own _ the Export Enhancement Program _ to
counter price-cutting competition.
   Lambert said that for most of the past 40 years, food
consumption in Eastern Europe was ``strictly subordinated'' to
other state priorities, meaning that consumers had to make do with
what was available.
   ``Hence, the long lines and empty shelves that characterized
communist rule,'' he said.
   The shift to competitive market economies, however, means East
European farm and food enterprises will have to be responsive to
consumer demands.
   ``At the same time, democratization is bringing consumerism to
the forefront of economic policy,'' Lambert said. ``It is even
possible that national food policies aimed at upgrading food
quality and nutrition will be set out and become as much a
cornerstone of agricultural poliy as mercantile considerations have
been.''
   Leaders in Eastern Europe no longer talk about self-sufficiency
in terms of domestic production supplying food requirements.
   ``Rather, they speak of importing food to add to domestic
supplies while exporting agricultural goods as an offset,'' he
said. ``For example, a Romanian official has said that his country
eventually should export surpluses of wheat and wine while
importing enough animal feedstuffs to cover domestic demand for
livestock products.''
   But in the near term, Lambert said, it is unlikely agriculture
in Eastern Europe will make great strides.
   ``Poland and Romania, which are two of the most populous East
European countries (38 million and 23 million people,
respectively), could face several years of serious shortages,'' he
said.
   Consequently, U.S. food-aid programs may be used to make
agricultural commodities available to those countries, Lambert said.

   Dams and other projects built since the
mid-1950s under the federal small watershed program have helped
ease the damage from floods this spring in south-central areas, the
National Association of Conservation Districts reports.
   In Oklahoma, where nearly one-third of the small watershed
structures are located, Soil Conservation Service officials
estimated that more than $6 million in damages was avoided.
   More than 600 small watershed dams were built in the
southeastern and south-central parts of Oklahoma, the association
said in its latest newsletter.
   The dams were designed to catch flood water and slowly release
it over 10 to 20 days. More than 16 billion gallons of water were
held by the dams during the heavy rains of April and May.
   ``This is water that would have been in the streams and rivers,
if not for the dams, and would have increased the flooding
considerably,'' said Budd Fountain, Oklahoma state conservationist.
   Conservation structures ``also performed admirably'' during the
recent flooding in northcentral Texas, said Wes Oneth,
conservationist for that state.

   Exports in 1989 accounted for more than 18
percent of the value of U.S. farm production, the highest rating in
five years, the Agriculture Department reports.
   The farm value of exports in calendar 1989 was $31.8 billion,
the department's Economic Research Service said Thursday. Gross
cash income of farmers was $174 billion.
   That meant the farm value of exports was 18.3 percent of last
year's gross income, the largest share since 1984, when the farm
export value was $30.4 billion and the gross was $155.3 billion _ a
share of 19.6 percent.
   The indicator dropped after peaking at 24 percent in the early
1980s, reaching a low of 13.8 percent in 1986 and 1987. It rose to
16.5 percent in 1988.

   Twenty-three Romanian tourists fearing a new
dictatorship in their country have asked France for political
asylum, authorities said.
   A group of 80 Romanians entered France as tourists on June 8,
local officials said Thursday. But when the time came to leave last
Sunday, 58 were missing.
   Of those 58, 23 have since asked for political asylum, and
police said they are looking for the others.
   Eight other Romanians, apart from the group of 80, have asked
for asylum in recent days.
   ``They fear that the government of their country is heading
toward a new dictatorship,'' said one local official.
   No decision has been made by regional authorities on what to do
with the Romanians until their cases are decided by the
government's Office for the Protection of Refugees and Exiles.
Charity groups are now housing them.
   In Bucharest, Health Ministry officials said Thursday that at
least five people were killed and 350 injured in two days of
violence between supporters and opponents of the governing National
Salvation Front.
   The front, largely composed of former Communists, spearheaded
the December revolution that toppled former dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. It won a landslide victory in national elections last
month, but protesters say it is guilty of many of the abuses of the
Ceausescu era.

<HEAD>Postal Service Considering Changing Delivery Procedures</HEAD>

   The Postal Service is weighing changes in how
it gets mail to nursing home residents who have moved, and to the
homeless.
   The agency has come under fire for refusing to forward nursing
home residents' mail automatically when they move. Elderly-rights
advocates say the policy treats residents like prison inmates by
placing the burden on the home to forward mail.
   The Postal Service will reconsider its practice as part of a
broad review, spokesman Lou Eberhardt said Thursday.
   The review ``is not a cursory glance,'' Eberhardt said. ``They
are going to assemble various sections of the Postal Service _
delivery, marketing, mail processing _ and sit down beginning next
week.''
   The purpose, Eberhardt said, ``is to determine whether changes
should be made not only from a standpoint of the nursing home
portion, but mail for homeless, mail being handled by agents. It's
hard to say exactly where it's going, but it may require some
procedural changes where nursing homes are concerned.''
   Since residents of a nursing home are at the same address, the
Postal Service says the home should be the ``agent'' of their mail.
The mail is delivered in bulk, like at a prison, and then
distributed.
   While other people may submit change-of-address cards to the
local post office, nursing home residents must rely on the
institution to write their new address on individual letters. Once
the mail is readdressed, the post office delivers it at no extra
charge.
   Allowing automatic forwarding is not ``practical
operationally,'' the Postal Service says. Since mail for individual
residents is not sorted at the post office, the agency says it
could not easily distinguish mail that needs to be forwarded from
the rest.
   ``It's absurd,'' Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said in an interview
Thursday. ``The Postal Service says `We can only deliver in bulk.'
But people are paying for first-class postage on that mail.''
   The agency review will include other possible problem areas.
   ``There are a lot of people getting mail who are homeless,''
Eberhardt said. He said most get their mail through general
delivery boxes, and the Postal Service wanted to see if the system
is working.
   Heinz wrote the agency in March questioning whether nursing home
residents should be classified ``with inmates, who have lost
important civil rights, or with short-term hospital patients.'' He
said he has received no response.
   Heinz acted after a Pennsylvania ombudsman for the elderly
complained of problems created when a nursing home was shut down by
the state last year, and the owner was not around to forward the
mail. A local agency ended up getting the letters to 30 displaced
residents.
   Also lobbying is Sister Mary Gregoria Rush of the Roman Catholic
Diocese of St. Petersburg, Fla. She wrote the agency, lawmakers and
first lady Barbara Bush seeking to change ``this policy that treats
nursing home residents like they were in jail or something.''

<HEAD>Gov't Urges Convictions Be Thrown Out in Bomb Factory Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will ask an appeals court
to throw out the convictions of seven people who served prison
sentences for allegedly running an IRA bomb factory.
   The announcement marked the collapse of all the convictions
stemming from two Irish Republican Army bombings of pubs in
Guildford and Woolwich in 1974, in which seven people died.
   ``I don't believe the convictions can be allowed to stand,''
Home Secretary David Waddington told the House of Commons Thursday.
   Hours earlier, England's senior prosecutor told a judicial
inquiry that the convictions were ``unsafe and unsatisfactory''
because of questions about the reliability of scientific tests
which were the core of the prosecution case.
   Four people convicted of the bombings were released in October,
after the director of public prosecutions said police had lied
about some evidence.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule of
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
Ireland.
   Six of those convicted in the bomb factory case have served
their sentences and the seventh, Guiseppe Conlon, died in prison in
1980.
   ``I only hope and pray now that it will go as soon as possible
to the appeals court to take the burden off our family, because it
has been a living nightmare,'' said Anne Maguire, who served 10
years in prison. Her husband, two sons, two relatives and a family
friend were also convicted.
   Waddington said he would not refer the case to the Court of
Appeal until the judicial inquiry, headed by Sir John May,
completes its work.
   The government's case was based on forensic evidence indicating
that all seven had traces of nitroglycerin on their hands.
   Allan Green, the director of public prosecutions, said he
considered the convictions unsatisfactory because recent tests had
shown that the defendants might have been contaminated by touching
something, such as a towel, that had been touched by someone else
who had handled explosives.
   Testimony at the inquiry revealed that the tests were done by an
18-year-old junior technician, and the results could not be
verified because all the samples were used up.
   ``The scientific evidence given to the jury may have misled them
into excluding the possibility of innocent contamination,'' Green
said.
   Mrs. Maguire was convicted in 1976 along with her husband,
Patrick; their sons, Vincent and Patrick; Guiseppe Conlon, Patrick
Maguire' brother-in-law; Sean John Smyth, Mrs. Maguire's brother,
and a family friend, Patrick Joseph O'Neill.
   Earlier this year, Waddington ordered an investigation into the
convictions of six men for pub bombings that killed 21 people in
Birmingham in November 1974. That investigation continues.
   In the House of Commons on Thursday, Waddington faced calls from
Labor Party legislators for a full public inquiry into the
Birmingham case.
   ``I will consider carefully what the May inquiry says about the
forensic evidence in the Maguire case. I will take fully into
account any implications it might have for the safety of other
convictions,'' Waddington said.
   In an interview with Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency, Mrs. Maguire said she was not bitter about the convictions,
``just very, very hurt that this could happen in my children's
country.''

   The nation's mayors, much like the White House
and Congress, aren't quite sure how big of a peace dividend will
result from planned cuts in defense spending.
   But they want half _ whatever the amount.
   The mayors open their annual summer meeting here today poised to
demand that much of the defense savings be funneled to cities to
help ease education, drug and housing problems they increasingly
blame on the White House and Congress.
   ``The federal government has walked away from the cities of
America and now we are beginning to see the dangerous results,''
said Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, a leading spokesman for the mayors.
   ``There are signs that cannot be ignored, even through the best
set of rose-colored glasses,'' Flynn said.
   He listed among his examples gang violence in his and several
other cities and recent tensions in New York resulting from court
proceedings against whites accused of participating in a mob attack
last summer that left a black teen-ager dead.
   ``This isn't a Republican or a Democratic problem alone or a
big-city problem alone or a liberal or conservative mayors' problem
alone,'' Flynn said. ``This is an American problem that is gnawing
at the social conscience of the American public.''
   Flynn this year moves up to the vice presidency of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, which is dominated by big-city Democratic
mayors who are frequent critics of the Republican Bush
administration. But even the organization's Republicans are voicing
rising frustration with White House priorities.
   ``We have considerable mandates placed upon us by the federal
government with less and less funding to carry them out,'' said
Republican Mayor Robert Isaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., who takes
over as president of the conference. ``We are not asking for a
handouts. We are asking for fairness.''
   The mayors will debate dozens of policy statements on an array
of issues, with a clear consensus in advance of the meeting in
favor of a proposal to demand that cities get half of any peace
dividend.
   But after a decade of cuts in federal aid to cities, few mayors
are optimistic their demand will be met.
   ``I'm not so naive as to believe the White House and the
Congress are going to listen to us mayors,'' Flynn said in an
interview Thursday. ``What we as an organization have to do is
generate political support. American cities are in deep trouble.''
   The mayors also will consider adopting dozens of policy
statements on health care, housing and other issues _ many similar
to stances taken at past meetings. Another asks the federal
government not to hurt local real estate markets by selling at
bargain-basement prices properties it controls because of savings
and loan failures.
   Isaac, whose area has been hard hit by S&amp;L failures, also is
lobbying to get the federal government to surrender some of the
properties to local governments for affordable-housing programs.
   ``Money for housing programs has been drying up,'' the Colorado
Springs mayor said. ``I see this as a tremendous opportunity to do
some good.''
   The six-day meeting opens today with the first joint meeting of
organization task forces on drug control and homelessness.
   At a meeting last week to plan the conference, several mayors
said street tensions in their cities appeared to be on the rise
heading into the summer months.
   ``This isn't a time for happy talk,'' said Flynn. ``A decade of
neglect of America's cities has created an abominable mix that
presents a dangerously tense situation for this summer and years to
come.''

<HEAD>Air Force is Willing to Delay Missile Modernization for Stealth
Development</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force, looking to bolster support for
the B-2 bomber, is willing to delay modernization of its two
land-based nuclear missiles to develop the stealth aircraft.
   President Bush's nominee for Air Force chief of staff, Gen.
Michael J. Dugan, said publicly Thursday what has been hinted for
weeks: The service has proposed to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
that work on the missiles be delayed.
   When asked if the Air Force had recommended that option, Dugan
told the Senate Armed Services Committee:
   ``I understand that. I accept that, approve that and I support
that. One needs to look at affordability issues in every regard.''
   Cheney must decide whether to slow down development of the
single-warhead Midgetman missile and delay plans to move the
multiple-warhead MX missile from fixed silos to railroad cars.
   In April, the defense secretary said the Bush administration
supports the MX rail-garrison program, which totals $2.8 billion in
the defense budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The budget
also calls for $202 million for the Midgetman.
   ``This is a proposal. It hasn't been reviewed. It's subject to
lots of further discussion,'' Dugan said.
   The commander of the Air Force in Europe said he supports the
proposal and indicated that his No. 1 concern is the B-2 stealth
bomber, the radar-evading plane that at more than $815 million a
copy has resulted in increasing congressional opposition.
   ``I rank the B-2 at the head of my list for all strategic
modernization programs in the Air Force,'' Dugan said.
   His second priority is the Midgetman missile and third is the MX
missile on railroad cars, which the service should have as a hedge
with research and development funds available, he said.
   ``I find a logic to that set of priorities,'' said committee
Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
committee, concurred.
   In an interview with Defense News, the outgoing chief of staff,
Gen. Larry Welch, said the United States ``ought to pause
intercontinental ballistic missile modernization until we have a
clear view of where we're going to go in the next step of arms
control.''
   Nunn indicated that Dugan and Adm. Frank B. Kelso, Bush's choice
for chief of Naval Operations, who also testified before the panel,
would win swift committee approval.

<HEAD>Cheney To Suggest Cuts In Military Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in anticipation
of Pentagon budget cuts, is freezing military construction for
another five months and will ask Congress to cancel a large number
of construction projects, his spokesman says.
   Next week, Cheney is expected to send Congress a list of
military construction projects that he would like to see
eliminated, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday.
   Cheney's move comes as Congress has been pressing for sharp
reductions in Pentagon spending and reductions in the nation's
military forces.
   His request is expected to cause some controversy on Capitol
Hill.
   Decisions to halt construction projects are seen by some as an
attack on pork barrel padding of the defense budget. But it also
fuels the debate between those who want to cut Pentagon spending
and lawmakers who want to protect local jobs.
   The secretary decided to extend a worldwide freeze on military
construction in order ``to help ensure the department proceeds with
the projects for which there is a genuine need,'' Williams said.
   Cheney will select his candidates for cancellation from a list
of some 207 projects _ including the controversial Navy ``home
ports'' in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York.
   Last month, Cheney ordered the 207 projects to be reviewed for
possible cancellation.
   Because funds for the projects already have been approved, the
secretary must ask Congress to withdraw the funding through a
process known formally as ``rescission.''
   Williams said he could not say exactly how many of the 207
projects might be cancelled, but added, ``It is fair to say that
the secretary believes that funding should be cancelled on a
substantial number of military construction projects.''
   ``I would expect a decision on this next week,'' Williams said.
   The freeze, which will run through Nov. 15, affects more than $7
billion in construction.
   The 207 specific projects under study for cancellation have been
valued by the Pentagon at $1.2 billion.
   Cheney first put a freeze on construction in January and
extended it in April. It was due to expire on June 15.
   The 207 sites under study included the so-called strategic home
ports in Ingleside, Texas; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula, Miss.; and
Staten Island, N.Y.
   The majority of the 207 projects under review were located
overseas, in particular in West Germany. Planned improvements or
construction of hangars, maintenance facilities, family housing
projects, schools for military dependents, and medical units were
among the items targeted.
   However, some of the domestic sites targeted carried hefty price
tags.
   Besides the four ports, the review also included a $110 million
project at a rocket test facility at Arnold, Tenn.; $60 million in
improvements at Fort Hood and Red River Army Depot in Texas; and a
$37 million project at a consolidated maintenance facility at
Tooele, Utah.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is giving a White House
send-off to 122 English teachers who are bringing the Peace Corps
to Poland and Hungary for the first time.
   The volunteers, in Washington for their final orientation, were
selected from the thousands of Americans who answered Bush's call
earlier this year for the Peace Corps to help the two East European
nations fill the vacuum created by the collapse of communist rule.
   ``It's almost as if the Peace Corps had been in training for 30
years for this moment,'' Paul D. Coverdell, the Peace Corps
director, said.
   Today, they will hear from Bush in a Rose Garden ceremony.
   Coverdell said the effort to create an English-language teaching
network in Poland and Hungary may open ``a good solid decade of
activity'' with expansion possible into the fields of environmental
protection and business development.
   After four decades of communism in Eastern Europe, the first
Peace Corps volunteers in Poland and Hungary are truly pioneers,
Coverdell said.
   ``It's a new relationship,'' he said. ``Anytime you are the
first there's pressure because everybody's eyes are on you.''
   Coverdell said the Peace Corps is aware of how different the
task in Eastern Europe will be compared to the developing countries
of the Third World where education is substandard.
   In Hungary and Poland, Peace Corps volunteers will be dealing
with ``a well-educated constituency that is dramatically
under-resourced,'' he said.
   One of the challenges, he said, is that ``they will be head to
head with an enlightened people. They will be sitting across the
table from someone who is clearly a match.''
   The volunteers, ranging in age from 21 to 77, come from 31
states coast to coast.
   Felix Lapinski, 66, a former official of the Agency for
International Development and of Polish descent, said he is looking
forward to his assignment to help Poles master English, a language
he says has become ``the access language'' of the modern era.
   Coverdell says English is vital as Eastern Europe turns to face
the West because it has become ``the language of commerce, science,
mathematics and computer technology.''
   ``In the very, very recent past, English was a closet language
in Eastern Europe; you had to learn it secretly,'' says Jerry
Welch, the Peace Corps' deputy director for Central Europe and
other regions.
   Welch noted that lessons in Russian, once a requirement, now
have been all but abandoned.
   ``Now they have a need for a large number of English teachers,''
Welch told volunteers.
   ``I think you will not find that you are any kind of threat to
existing English teachers,'' he assured them. ``They are few in
number and overwhelmed.''
   Coverdell says that far from draining the resources of the Peace
Corps, the opening to Eastern Europe has struck the popular
imagination and sparked as much interest in the idealistic
organization as at any time since it was launched 30 years ago by
President Kennedy.
   He noted that almost 30 countries around the globe have
indicated interest recently in Peace Corps programs.
   ``The Peace Corps is now widely understood,'' Coverdell said.
``I think it was a great idea and I think it has proved itself. I
think it has won over virtually all of its original skeptics.''

   The band 2 Live Crew proved Thursday night it
could perform without breaking any laws, and even the police chief
admitted he liked the rap concert.
   ``I consider it the PG version,'' Gwinnett County Police Chief
Wayne Bolden said. ``This is the first rap concert I've been to and
I'm kind of enjoying it. I like the beat.''
   The band, whose X-rated lyrics got its star arrested in Florida,
performed about 40 minutes at a teen nightclub before an estimated
320 people, including three police officers.
   The band had canceled an 8 p.m. concert, and a promoter blamed
the decision on ``all the hype'' about the group's problems with
the law.
   ``They had a fear that they would be arrested whether they did
the clean show'' or an adult version, said promoter Chris Lyons of
Salt and Pepper Entertainment.
   Lyons said the band missed its morning flight from Miami as it
sought assurances there would be no arrests if they kept their show
in this Atlanta suburb clean.
   The band did not arrive from the Atlanta airport until after 11
p.m., delaying the 10:30 p.m. show about an hour.
   Bolden said he met with band members when they arrived and
``told them about the obscenity law. I also told them they could
not play any songs from the album,'' ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   He said band members ``thanked him for the explanation.''
   Bolden had threatened to arrest the rappers if they performed
any songs from the sexually explicit but popular album.
   Lyons said, ``All the hype about the show was that they would do
an X-rated show at a teen venue.''
   Among those waiting outside the nightclub in anticipation of the
concert that was cancelled were eight people protesting attempts to
squelch 2 Live Crew's music, which features explicit lyrics. They
carried signs reading ``Does anyone remember the Bill of Rights?''
and ``A bad rap for the First Amendment.''
   ``I don't like the music, but I still see it as a First
Amendment thing,'' said Donna Williamson, 38, of Duluth. ``If the
music is that bad, it will die a natural death.''
   Police had hoped to meet with the group earlier Thursday at
their hotel, but the hotel canceled the reservation, saying it had
been made ``under false pretenses.''
   Police spokesman Larry Walton said officers wanted to meet with
the performers at their hotel ``to try to get some assurances as to
what they're going to do'' in their shows.
   He said police did meet with the club's owner, Ed Kramer.
   Dan Marone, manager of the Gwinnett Place Marriott, said he
refused to let the performers stay at the hotel because they
falsely claimed that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew
Young planned to hold a news conference at the hotel on their
behalf.
   Young's campaign spokesman, Nehl Horton, said the candidate
never planned a news conference involving the band. ``We have no
association whatsoever with 2 Live Crew,'' Horton said. ``Andy's
name has been tossed around haphazardly and without authorization.
He doesn't condone their music.''
   Lyons declined to say where the group would stay.
   He said he was not aware of the hotel's accusations concerning a
Young news conference.
   Chief Assistant Solicitor David Fuller advised Gwinnett police
earlier this week that the ``Nasty as They Wanna Be'' album
violates Georgia's obscenity law because it contains graphic
descriptions of intercourse and sodomy.
   Florida police arrested two of the Miami-based rappers last
weekend after they played songs from the album at an all-adult
show. A record store owner also was arrested for selling the album.
The arrests came after a federal judge ruled that the album was
obscene.
   That ruling, which was limited to three south Florida counties,
is on appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   The album also has come under attack by authorities in at least
two other states.
   In Columbia, S.C., solicitor James Anders on Wednesday deemed
said he will give Richland County record store owners 10 days to
clear the album from their shelves.
   ``We reviewed it, and we definitely feel it's obscene,'' he said.
   Police in San Antonio started calling 84 local record stores
Tuesday to tell them the album may violate Texas obscenity laws.
Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the vice squad, said if his office
receives complaints in the next few days, officers will go out, buy
the album and press charges.

<HEAD>House Democrats want HUD Probe to Include Possible Perjury by
Pierce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are pressing an independent
counsel to widen his probe to include allegations that former
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. lied to Congress.
   The lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on
Thursday asking him to refer the allegations against Pierce to the
independent counsel appointed after revelations of scandals at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   The letter, signed by all 22 Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee, cited testimony last month by former assistant HUD
Secretary DuBois L. Gilliam as new evidence suggesting that Pierce
lied when he was questioned last year by Congress about the HUD
scandals.
   Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month prison term for conspiracy
and accepting an illegal gratuity, testified that Pierce ordered
him several times to make grant awards to developers with
Republican political connections.
   In testimony last year to the House Government Operations
employment and housing subcommittee, Pierce insisted he ``did not
have hands on'' involvement in disbursing money through the
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, saying that he ``never told these
people to fund anything.''
   In their letter to Thornburgh, the 22 Democrats said Gilliam
``described at least two instances in which Mr. Pierce was directly
involved in abuses of the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.'
   The letter said Gilliam ``may have contradicted Mr. Pierce's
earlier testimony,'' citing Gilliam's statements that the former
Cabinet secretary was ``the big dealer'' in HUD grants.
   Gilliam told the panel last month that Pierce used the HUD
secretary's discretionary grant program as ``a private political
slush fund.''
   After reviewing Gilliam's testimony, Thornburgh asked
independent counsel Arlin M. Adams to broaden his investigation to
include allegations of political favoritism in the operation of the
discretionary grant fund and the Urban Development Action Grant
Program.
   Adams was originally appointed to investigate whether Pierce and
former top aides showed political favoritism in the operation of
the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The independent counsel is taking steps to widen his
investigation and has granted immunity to Gilliam, according to a
source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Adams has also issued
grand jury subpoenas to Pierce and his former associates, sources
said.
   Thornburgh sought appointment of the HUD independent counsel
after reviewing allegations turned over to the Justice Department
by Judiciary Committee Democrats.
   But the attorney general rejected the lawmakers' request that
the investigation include allegations of perjury against Pierce.
   Thornburgh said at the time that the questions Pierce was asked
and the answers he gave were so ambiguous that they did not provide
any evidence of perjury.
   Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's defense attorneys, said
Gilliam's testimony does not change Thornburgh's earlier conclusion
that there was no ``specific and credible'' allegation of perjury
that warranted further investigation.
   Gilliam ``was never asked directly about anything that Pierce
testified about that was of a specific enough nature for him to be
able to contradict anything,'' Plotkin said.
   But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the signers of the
letter said ``Gilliam has added new cause to look into perjury.''
   ``Gilliam's testimony both takes the potential perjury into new
areas as well makes the case stronger,'' Schumer said. ``I think it
merits a serious look by the independent counsel. Let the
independent counsel determine matters of the depth of the
evidence.''

<HEAD>Administration Accuses Japan of Failing To Honor Trade Commitments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ambitious U.S.-Japanese trade talks are
stalled with American officials threatening not to sign a landmark
agreement if the Japanese fail to open further their markets to
U.S. goods.
   The ongoing dispute flared into the open Thursday when Bush
administration officials charged that Japan was failing to honor
commitments made in April to attack the root causes of America's
$49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   In April, both countries signed an interim agreement pledging to
make fundamental economic reforms to reduce the huge trade
imbalance between the two economic superpowers.
   In the agreement, known as the Structural Impediments
Initiative, Japan pledged to boost its public works spending and
move toward breaking up the cozy relationships between Japanese
firms that keep foreign companies from doing business in Japan's
market.
   The United States pledged to intensify efforts to reduce the
federal budget deficit, improve its education system and boost its
low savings rate.
   The interim report was due to be followed in early July with a
final report fleshing out the broad commitments and setting up a
monitoring arrangement to insure compliance.
   However, talks on the final report have made little progress
with the U.S. side pushing for specifics to back up the Japanese
promises and the Japanese insisting they have gone as far as they
can go.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
Thursday the administration intended to ``keep the pressure on'' to
ensure that ``all the commitments make it through to the final
report.''
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters on
background, was even more blunt, warning that the United States
might refuse to sign a final report unless the Japanese are more
forthcoming.
   ``It would be highly regrettable that if, at this stage, this
process lost momentum and reversed itself,'' the official said. He
charged that top Japanese officials have failed to provide
sufficient guidance to their negotiators.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama in San Francisco on Friday.
The administration is hoping those discussions will get the trade
talks back on track.
   The next round of talks on structural barriers is scheduled for
June 25-26 in Tokyo with the final report due before the Houston
economic summit meeting on July 9.
   If not cleared up before then, a trade fight between the United
States and Japan would threaten the upbeat mood at this year's
economic meeting of the world's seven richest industrial countries.
   Officials briefing reporters Thursday said key sticking points
in the current negotiations revolve around how much more Japan will
spend on public works projects and how it will toughen its
antitrust penalties.
   The administration is also bothered by the Japanese insistence
that they do not need to reduce their huge trade surplus because
the excess money is needed to supply capital for the reconstruction
of Eastern Europe, the unification of Germany and debt-strapped
nations in Latin America.
   The administration says the new position is a negotiating ploy
that fails to take into account other ways to raise needed
investment capital besides running huge trade surpluses that
destabilize the global economy.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, testifying before the
Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, said he hoped the Japanese
were not trying to stonewall American negotiators to test the
administration's resolve.
   ``They did take some very good first steps but they have got a
lot farther to go, as we do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Cocaine Prices are Up, Anti-Drug Efforts Paying Off</HEAD>

   Rising wholesale cocaine prices show anti-drug
efforts are ``starting to pay off,'' and causing shortages,
national drug director William J. Bennett says.
   ``It looks as if we are beginning to have a positive effect on
the flow of cocaine into this country,'' Bennett said Thursday.
``This can change. This can bump up and down, as time goes on, but
it looks like some real impact is occurring.
   ``We're putting some tremendous pressure on drug traffickers and
I think it's starting to pay off,'' he said, crediting Colombia's
crackdown on the cocaine cartels and interdiction and investigative
efforts by U.S. agencies.
   But Bennett warned: ``No one should be lulled into thinking that
this is the end.''
   Drug traffickers, thwarted in efforts to bring cocaine into the
United States, ``will now try to divert, do other things, try to
get more in other ways,'' he said. ``We've got to be ready for them
at the next place.''
   The Drug Enforcement Administration disagreed with Bennett's
conclusion that increases in wholesale cocaine prices in Los
Angeles and New York City reflect a shortage in cocaine.
   ``The story is that we are very, very cautiously optimistic that
the changes in price that we are seeing in some markets reflect
tremendously successful law enforcement efforts,'' said DEA
spokesman Frank Shults.
   However, he added, ``we are not saying the United States has
experienced any cocaine shortage,'' and there is ``absolutely no''
indication of a nationwide trend.
   The good news, Shults said, is that the DEA has found that a
kilogram of cocaine today in New York City can fetch as much as
$35,000 at the wholesale level, up from official estimates last
fall of $14,000 to $18,000.
   In Los Angeles, wholesale prices have risen from $10,000 per
kilogram in lots of 10 or more and $15,000 for smaller amounts last
fall to $25,000 today. Shults said one recent case there involved a
price of $35,000.
   ``In undercover operations, we're finding people saying, `I'll
pay any price,''' he said.
   The wholesale price of cocaine also has gone up in Boston, but
it has stayed about the same in Miami and it has gone both up and
down in Phoenix, where a kilogram still can be bought for a
``bargain'' $11,000, Shults said.
   Traffickers in New York also have been making deals for
half-kilo amounts of cocaine, when they used to trade only in lots
of 10 kilograms or more, he said.
   In addition, when agents seized a large shipment of cocaine in
Baltimore recently, it was not pure but already had been diluted,
which the DEA saw as a ``very, very good sign,'' he said.
   ``We believe very strongly that the enforcement activities of
the United States, of the Andean nations of Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia, have had the effect of disrupting the major cocaine
cartels,'' Shults said.
   But he acknowledged the possibility that entrepreneurs are
simply demanding more for their goods, scaring buyers into thinking
there are shortages.
   ``There could be gouging,'' he said. ``There could be
stockpiling. There could be a shortage.''
   Bennett said a cocaine shortage could trigger increased
violence, even though he has long cited the violence that
accompanies drug trafficking as a reason to eliminate the drugs.
   ``We've got a long summer ahead of us, and in some of our
communities where there is a shortage of cocaine, there will be
violence as a result of that,'' he said. ``There will be the same
number of dogs fighting over a smaller number of bones. And we can
anticipate some of that this summer.''

   People who knew Joe T. Meador say they
can't believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in
medieval art from a German church while he was a soldier during
World War II.
   The possibility that Meador stashed the precious cache in a
Whitewright bank vault was the talk of this farm town Thursday,
when The New York Times quoted unidentified sources as saying he
was responsible for one of the century's biggest art thefts.
   ``I just don't believe he was that kind of a man,'' said
73-year-old Mary Bryant, who said she had visited Meador's home but
could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art.
   ``He didn't seem the type of guy to me that would do something
like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, who also lives in this town of
1,760 people about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The newspaper said Meador, in the final days of World War II,
took the objects from a church in Quedlinburg, an ancient castle
town in what is now East Germany. The Times based its report on
interviews with art experts, lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   Stolen was a small, silver display case inlaid with enamels and
precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a liturgical
ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock crystal flasks
and gold and silver crucifixes, and other treasures.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   Dietrich Kotzsche, a German authority in medieval decorative
art, said the Quedlinburg treasures, dating to the 9th and 10th
centuries, could be worth millions.
   The Times reported today that the church in Quedlinburg has
retained two lawyers to seek the return of the art.
   Meador died in 1980 at age 64. He co-owned a family hardware and
farm tool business and grew orchids in a greenhouse behind the
two-story Victorian home he shared with his mother, Mabel.
   ``He was the type of fellow that didn't mix with people much,''
said Odell Caraway, a member of American Legion Post 225 to which
Meador once belonged. ``As far as I know he's never been involved
in any kind of crooked stuff.''
   Willi A. Korte, a West German government official who
specializes in the repatriation of cultural property, and Thomas R.
Kline of the law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth of Washington and Dallas,
said they planned a trip to Dallas today to negotiate with Meador's
relatives, the Times said.
   Neither those lawyers nor John S. Torigian, an attorney for
Meador's brother, Jack, could be reached for comment Thursday by
The Associated Press.
   Meador was an officer in the 87th Armored Field Artillery, which
occupied Quedlinburg and guarded a mine shaft where the Times said
the treasures were kept. The items disappeared a few days after
U.S. troops took over the area in 1945, the newspaper said.
   Three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they had never
known their boss to show off any art works.
   The Times reported that a source it did not identify said the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan. Harrell Stowers,
the bank's executive vice president, would not confirm that
information Thursday when asked by The Associated Press.
   Jack Meador, his wife, Jean, and Meador's sister, Jane Meador
Cook, also would not comment Thursday.
   How the treasures got to Texas is a secret that may have died
with Meador.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement since the machine gun
deal,'' said Mayor Clarence Tillet Jr., who explained that a judge
once charged four machine guns in the town's name to avoid paying
sales tax.

<HEAD>Orange Is Color of Love Among Guppies, Researchers Find</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange guppy males can wind up either as a
favorite of females or as dinner, according to a study published
today in the journal Science.
   Female guppies with the mating urge like finned suitors with
flashy bright patches of orange.
   Unfortunately, predators also favor the guys with the big, bold
colors.
   Princeton University researcher Anne E. Houde said female
guppies ``do indeed seem to prefer males that have overall brighter
colors ... such as how much orange they have in their patterns.''
   But that also is a combination that attracts big fish, birds and
other predators.
   Houde and John A. Endler of the University of California, Santa
Barbara, researched the color preferences of guppy love by taking
fish from six different locations in Trinidad, a tropical island
where the vividness of guppy colors varies from stream to stream.
   They found that when a female guppy showed a preference in her
mate selection, she went for the guys with those dazzling orange
colors.
   But not all female guppies made their selections on such
superficial criteria, Houde said. For females from streams where
most males were dull hues, she said, color didn't seem to be a
factor.
   And how do you tell when guppies get romantic?
   Male guppies, Houde said, swim to a female and make a courtship
display, ``like a little dance.''
   ``If she is interested then she will start gliding toward him
and there will be a mating,'' Houde said. ``If she's not
interested, she will seem to pay no attention whatsoever. She has
to have that initial response or there is no mating.''
   Females also have a roving eye and may mate with two or three
male guppies.
   Unlike most fish, guppy eggs are fertilized and hatched
internally. The females give birth after three weeks. Broods
average 10 to 15.
   Houde said that by studying mating choices among the guppies,
scientists hope to learn more about the forces that shape evolution.
   Species colors may also be affected by choices made by
predators. And, predators, she said, tend to eat brightly colored
guppies more often than the duller ones.
   ``For whatever reason that females have preference for
particular males, then that is an evolutionary force,'' she said.
``And for whatever reason the males are subject to predators,
that's an evolution force.''
   Houde said female guppies may choose orange mates because that
is color of health in the guppy world.
   ``Females are able to identify males who are healthy and
resistant to parasites because they can put on a good show of
orange,'' she said. Infected or diseased males have duller colors.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   A strong earthquake hit the central
Philippines, killing at least four people and injuring 15 and
damaging roads, bridges and houses, a civil defense official said
today.
   The earthquake, which measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, struck
Thursday at 4:47 p.m. and was followed by five aftershocks, said
Julio Sabit of the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.
   Preliminary readings indicated the quake was centered just
outside Kalibo on central Panay Island, 260 miles south of Manila.
   The quake was felt from the northern tip of Mindanao Island to
Manila on Luzon Island, Sabit said.
   Four people were killed in Kulasi, a town in Antique province,
said Rodrigo Roldan, regional director of civil defense in the city
of Iloilo. No further details of the deaths were immediately
available.
   Roldan said 15 other people were hospitalized for cuts and
fractures suffered after several houses collapsed. The quake also
caused a landslide in Kulasi, he said.
   The earthquake partially damaged a movie house, cracked the
walls of a Roman Catholic church, and toppled the head of a statue
of Jesus Christ in the town center of Kalibo, Roldan said.
   It damaged roads and bridges in the Kulasi and another town,
Balite, and partially destroyed the wharf in Altavas. It also
destroyed a rural health center and a rice mill in Balite.
   Roldan said churches in the towns of Makato and Quartero also
were damaged. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
An earthquake measuring 6 is capable of causing severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Owners of huge farms in the West who have
gotten rich by using water subsidized by the federal government
will have to pay full price if legislation approved by the House
becomes law.
   The price tag for some producers would be in the millions of
dollars, but the bill's author, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said,
``It will stop the raid on the federal treasury.''
   ``This was about excesses,'' Miller said Thursday after the
House passed his bill. ``This was about people who pushed the
Congress too far looking for special treatment.''
   The federal government has been building dams in the West since
the early part of the century to supply water for farming.
   Miller attached his amendment to a water projects bill that
authorized spending for modifications to the Buffalo Bill Dam and
reservoir in Wyoming.
   Basically, it strengthens the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 by
defining ``farm'' and ``farm operation'' in greater detail for
determining eligibility for cheap water.
   The original legislation said subsidized water could go to farms
no larger than 960 acres. However, it left a loophole that allowed
corporations to reorganize their property into smaller entities and
continue to get cheap water without actually breaking apart their
businesses.
   A farm owner named repeatedly during debate was the J.G. Boswell
Co., one of the largest agricultural producers in the nation. The
corporation runs a 23,000-acre farm in California's Central Valley,
but it continued to get subsidized water legally by reorganizing
into an employee-owned company.
   Under the House bill, Boswell and others who have formed
partnerships that send profits to a main office would have to pay
full price for water.
   ``These aren't separate farmers,'' said Miller. ``These are a
scheme to continue the flow of federal taxpayer dollars to the
land. These are a scheme to start farming the treasury as opposed
to farming the land.''
   He said 98 percent of the farmers in the program are in
compliance with Congress' intent in the law. He said the others
were only a handful of people.
   ``But they're very powerful people,'' he said. ``They're very
big in the political contribution business. They're very big at
fund-raisers. They're very big in party politics.''
   Miller's amendment passed the House by a 316-97 vote. Another
amendment offered by Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., and approved
338-55, would phase out irrigation subsidies used on crops that are
subsidized under agriculture programs.
   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
   Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., who opposed the bill, said
it would harm small farmers.
   Its ``result will be to discourage production of that very thing
at which Americans are the very best at in the world: namely food
and fiber,'' he said.

<HEAD>High-Rolling Thrift Executive Falls From Life of Luxury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financial wizard who tumbled from the top of a
savings and loan empire in just a few years says the government has
made him a scapegoat for the nation's thrift troubles.
   Donald Dixon said he will plead innocent to 38 counts of a
federal indictment, which alleges conspiracy, fraud and furthering
racketeering.
   ``For the moment, the U.S. government is making a scapegoat of
me because they're unaccountable for their role in the $500 billion
or greater loss the American taxpayer has to pay,'' he said
Thursday, shortly after he was freed on a personal recognizance
bond by U.S. Magistrate John B. Tolle.
   Dixon, who had surrendered to the FBI, was forced by federal
regulators in 1986 to relinquish control of Vernon Savings and Loan
Association, where seven former officers and employees have been
convicted of bank fraud charges. Dixon owned the thrift.
   Prosecutors say Dixon, who lived a life of luxury and hobnobbed
with the powerful, was an example, along with his thrift, of the
abuses that led S&amp;Ls into disaster.
   The Dixon case is an effort ``to bring to justice people who
break the law, who use savings and loan associations as personal
piggy banks and who may have thought they could just walk away free
and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed,''
said Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision in
Washington.
   Dixon is accused of using thousands of dollars from Vernon
Savings on pleasure trips, prostitutes and illegal contributions to
politicians, including former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack
Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Sens. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Dixon flew on corporate jets, relaxed on a corporate yacht and
enjoyed a salary and benefits running into the millions with the
thrift's money, government attorneys said.
   Dixon had a California beach house, Rolls Royces and an art
collection. He bought his wife $110 bottles of perfume and traveled
to the spas and restaurants of Europe.
   In his home town, Dixon bought tiny Vernon Savings in 1982 after
success heading two homebuilding and development companies, Dondi
Homes and Raldon Homes.
   Vernon Savings, in less than four years under Dixon's lead, grew
by a staggering 1,600 percent, even though S&amp;Ls are prohibited from
growing more than 25 percent per year. It became one of the top 20
Texas thrifts with $1.6 billion in deposits.
   After moving Vernon's headquarters to Dallas, Dixon offered high
rates that attracted depositors from across the country. The
deposits were guaranteed for up to $100,000 by the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., and millions of dollars flew in.
   Vernon went on a lending binge with deposits as new rules
allowed S&amp;Ls into commercial developments. Loans also were allowed
on projects with little capital behind them and no down payments.
   Court documents show Vernon officers developed an efficient way
to create as much loan-fee income as possible and paid little
attention to traditional lending practices.
   The thrift's executives fudged their required filings with
regulators to make it look healthier, the government said. At the
end of 1986, Vernon Savings reported a positive net worth of $17
million, which regulators say was actually a negative $350 million.
Ninety-six percent of the thrift's loans were overdue.
   In 1986, federal regulators forced out Dixon. The next year he
and other Vernon officials were sued by regulators trying to
recover the thrift's losses, and Dixon filed for personal
bankruptcy. That case is pending.
   The charges against Dixon carry a maximum penalty of 190 years
in prison and a $9.5 million fine.

   Jay Gorney, whose song ``Brother Can You Spare a
Dime'' became the musical symbol for the Great Depression years in
the United States, has died at age 93.
   Gorney died Thursday from Parkinson's disease at the Jewish Home
and Hospital for the Aged.
   Gorney composed for the musical theater in the 1920s and 1930s
and worked on shows such as ``Merry-Go-Round,'' ``Earl Carroll's
Sketch Book,'' ``Touch and Go,'' and ``Meet the People.''
   He wrote ``Brother Can You Spare a Dime,'' for the 1932 show
``Americana.'' His film scores included ``Mona Lisa'' and ``They
Can't Get You Down.''
   Gorney was born on Dec. 12, 1896, in Bialystok, Russia, and
emigrated to the United States when he was a child. He and his
family settled in Detroit.
   He worked his way through the University of Michigan by writing
school songs and leading school bands. He was admitted to the bar,
but gave up law after one year to pursue songwriting full time.
   Gorney is survived by his wife, Sondra, a daughter and two sons.
Funeral services will be private.

   ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' has upped
the ante for amateur videomakers.
   Instead of a single $100,000 grand prize, the ABC-TV program
will offer three $100,000 awards in the fall season, entertainment
president Robert Iger announced Thursday during the network's
annual affiliates convention.
   While the Sunday night program has become enormously popular, it
also has drawn criticism for showing videos of children and animals
in potentially dangerous situations.
   This year's $100,000 grand prize winner went to footage of a man
losing his pants while trying to catch a baseball.

   A stunt pilot practicing for an air show
was killed when his plane crashed in a field, authorities said.
   Steven Van Eck, 38, of Zeeland, was practicing maneuvers when
his single-engine plane crashed about 12:30 p.m. Thursday, the
Ottawa County Sheriff's Department said.
   Van Eck, the only person aboard, was flying the Kevlar and
carbon-fiber plane he planned to use at the Battle Creek
International Balloon Championship and Air Show, which begins
Saturday, organizers said. A pamphlet about Van Eck said he had won
several awards for stunt flying.
   Authorities said they didn't what caused the crash. The Federal
Aviation Administration was investigating.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Leader Forges Religion Into Potent Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The philosophy professor who led the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front to an unexpected election
victory this week has formed the country's most potent political
force in less than 17 months.
   Sheikh Abassi Madani serves as president of the party's 14-man
governing council. Almost always clad in white, he can be
soft-spoken in private and a fiery orator in public.
   In March 1989, he created the Islamic Salvation Front after
voters backed a new constitution legalizing opposition to the
ruling, secular National Liberation Front.
   The surging Islamic party now claims 650,000 members and 3
million sympathizers, many drawn from the ranks of unemployed youth
with limited economic prospects.
   Madani, 59, and his party want to revolutionize Algerian
society, turning the clock back from the failed one-party socialist
model the ruling party tried to impose for 28 years. Tuesday's
election marked the first free vote since independence from France
in 1962.
   The fundamentalists want to make Algeria an Islamic republic and
impose religious law, the Sharia, that would strip women of most of
their civil rights.
   Madani was born in 1931 at Sidi Okba in southern Algeria, a
region strong in religious tradition. He studied the Koran and once
worked as a truck driver. He obtained his doctorate in philosophy
from a British university.
   Madani has been jailed twice in his life.
   He took up arms with the National Liberation Front in 1954
against the colonial French rulers. Madani was captured during a
failed bomb attack and spent the next seven years in prison.
   After liberation, Madani criticized the ruling party for
abandoning Islam in favor of socialism. But few heard his voice
until after socialist leader Houari Boumediene died in 1978.
   Boumediene's successor, President Chadli Bendjedid, relaxed free
speech laws at the same time the Iranian revolution was capturing
the imagination of Islamic fundamentalists throughout the Middle
East.
   Madani began a two-year prison in 1982 for organizing a
fundamentalist protest. After he was freed, he renewed his efforts
to place fundamentalist imams in the country's 10,000 mosques.
   The Islamic Salvation Front has targeted the country's schools
and universities for membership and succeeded in forcing many
female students and teachers to wear the hijab, or Islamic scarf.
   It also seeks adherents in the Algerian army. Top brass recently
forbade soldiers to wear beards, a badge of fundamentalism. But, as
Madani noted Wednesday, many in the army voted for his party anyway.

<HEAD>Study Says Cable TV Rates Rising at Twice the Inflation Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Basic cable television rates climbed at twice
the rate of inflation last year, according to a report that
refueled the drive in Congress to re-regulate subscriber charges.
   The prices for the lowest-cost basic service and most popular
cable services in 1989 increased an average of 10 percent, from
$14.50 to $15.95, the congressional General Accounting Office said.
The total average cable bill went up 5 percent, from $25 to $26.36.
   The inflation rate was 4 percent to 5 percent rate for the year,
said GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   GAO reported last year that basic cable rates increased 29
percent from December 1986 to October 1988.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who requested the GAO survey,
said the results showed that Congress ``must consider legislation
that will rein in the renegade operators'' in the cable industry.
   He said the report should erase ``any lingering doubts on the
need to move forward'' with legislation that ``enhances competition
and ensures reasonable rates.''
   The House Energy and Commerce telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, which Markey chairs, is expected to approve a cable
regulation bill later this month. A Senate subcommittee approved
its own bill last week calling for more competition for cable and
renewed rate regulation of mostly basic, over-the-air broadcast
channels.
   The National Cable Television Association said the GAO report
``reconfirms that the average cable subscriber's monthly bill
increased at about the rate of inflation in 1989, and is still
further evidence that cable rate increases have leveled off.'' It
said cable ``is still a very good buy.''
   But Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, said the leveling off, if any, was being
achieved by cable operators lowering the costs of premium services
such as HBO and Showtime, while raising basic rates.
   ``But you have to have basic to get premium,'' Kimmelman said.
``That's where they've got you over a barrel.''
   Between Nov. 30, 1986, and Dec. 31, 1989, rates for the
lowest-priced and most popular service increased by 43 percent,
from an average $11.14 to $15.95 per subscriber, GAO said.
   Average total cable bills went up 21 percent, from $21.78 to
$26.36 during that period.
   About 20 percent of the subscribers to either the most popular
or lowest priced service experienced price increases in the three
years greater than 60 percent, GAO said. From 1984 through 1989,
the average increase was 65 percent.
   During 1989 the number of channels available to cable
subscribers increased by one or two, on average. Since the cable
industry was deregulated in November 1986, the average number of
basic channels available has risen from 24 to 31 channels.
   GAO said cable systems that were regulated in November 1986 had
greater increases through last December than the 24 percent of the
nation's cable TV systems that were not regulated in November 1986.
   The GAO based its results on questionnaires returned from 1,530
of the nation's approximately 9,000 cable systems.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Simon's Presidential Campaign Used Senate Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer is asking the Senate Ethics Committee
to investigate Sen. Paul Simon's hiring practices, but a
spokeswoman for the Illinois Democrat says the request is a
partisan ruse.
   In his 13-page complaint, John J. Curry Jr. of Chicago says
several employees were hired in Simon's Senate office and given
campaign duties while he ran for president in 1987-88.
   Once his bid for the Democratic nomination ended, so did the
Senate jobs, Curry says.
   He also says some of Simon's top Senate aides were given
significant campaign roles but never lost their public salaries and
in some cases received raises.
   The attorney said his allegations are based on Senate and
federal election records. He lists names, dates and amounts of
money.
   Curry filed a separate complaint with the Federal Election
Commission, alleging an improper relationship between Simon's
presidential campaign and a political action committee the senator
once headed, called the Democracy Fund.
   Ellen Golin, spokeswoman for Simon's Senate re-election
campaign, called the Ethics Committee complaint ``part of the
Republican dirty tricks strategy.''
   She said the committee gave Simon a copy of the complaint in
late May, and he is preparing a response.
   ``There are in excess of 100 erroneous allegations there,''
Golin said Thursday. ``This lawyer didn't have concern for the
facts.''
   In an interview, Curry acknowledged being a Republican but said
his decision to file the complaint was not part of an organized
Republican effort to discredit Simon. He said he decided to study
the documents after hearing allegations from others.
   Curry's complaint, dated April 11, says: ``Sen. Simon, directly
or indirectly, allowed his official Senate allowances and staff to
be used to supplement the limited financial resources available''
to his presidential campaign.
   ``It appears,'' the complaint says, ``that Sen. Simon acted
negligently with respect to his obligation as a senator to observe
the strictures of both federal law and the standing rules of the
Senate.''
   The Ethics Committee's chief attorney, Wilson Abney, would not
comment on the complaint.
   Curry released a letter from Abney that shows the committee
received the complaint.
   Besides payroll allegations, the complaint says at least five of
Simon's Senate employees lent money or services to his presidential
campaign. It also questions whether some Senate-financed plane
trips taken by Simon and his staff were actually related to his
campaign.

<HEAD>Non-farm Lawmakers Oppose Subsidy Payments to Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some non-farm area lawmakers are ready to
pounce on the 1990 farm bill approved by the House Agriculture
Committee because they oppose paying subsidies to farmers who
already make a decent living.
   But committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said, ``This
is a farm bill that I will be proud to defend on the House floor
and it's one that deserves the support of my House colleagues.''
   Debate is likely to begin the week of June 25.
   Ready to attack is a group called the Coalition for Common Sense
Agriculture. Led by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., the group of non-farm area lawmakers oppose paying
thousands of dollars in subsidies to farmers whose earnings are
higher than the average taxpayer.
   ``Though the House Agriculture Committee has made progress by
imposing a freeze on subsidies, it is clear that some parts of the
1990 farm bill do a disservice to American taxpayers,'' Armey and
Schumer said Thursday in a joint statement.
   Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on
the Appropriations Committee, already has introduced a bill that
attacks the farm payment programs by limiting farmers to $50,000 a
year in government payments.
   ``Too much of the farm budget is going to wealthy corporate
farms, not enough to family farmers, and too much of the money does
nothing to improve the supply and price of food for Americans,''
Schumer and Armey's statement said. ``These trends need to change
so that our agriculture policy reflects common sense rather than
special interests.''
   Committee members have argued vehemently that government
programs supporting farmers stabilize food prices and help the
government manage the industry.
   The Agriculture Committee completed work on the bill with a
marathon session beginning Wednesday and ending early Thursday
morning in which lawmakers added changes in conservation measures
to a host of other programs, passed weeks earlier, that guide
agriculture policy for the next five years.
   De la Garza said the bill assures farmers a reasonable income
but meets tight federal budget demands.
   ``It also gives farmers more flexibility to plant according to
market signals, it provides authority for expanded food safety
research and it allows for modest increases in our domestic food
assistance programs,'' de la Garza said.
   He said it would protect U.S. competitiveness in the world
market and prevent large stockpiles of surplus food.
   ``I am particularly proud of the committee's conservation
package,'' he said, characterizing it as a balance between
agriculture production needs and environmental quality goals.
   Major provisions of the bill include:
   _A freeze on target prices for cotton, rice, wheat and feed
grains.
   _Loan rates of $5.25 a bushel for soybeans during 1991-92 with
possible increases in subsequent years.
   _A flexibility program that allows farmers who grow government
supported crops to transfer 25 percent of their acreage into an
experimental crop without losing that acreage in calculations for
price supports.
   _A dairy program that sets a minimum support level of $10.10 per
hundred pounds of milk.
   _Continuation of present peanut, sugar, honey, wool and mohair
programs.
   _A trade program that allows donation of commodities to the
world's poorest countries, puts deadlines on multi-year agreements
and forgives loans to the poorest countries. It also would
authorize assistance to private voluntary organizations and
cooperatives in administering food programs and reauthorize the
Food for Progress program, which donates food to countries that
encourage private enterprise and agricultural reform.
   _A requirement that the government spend at least $500 million
annually in the Export Enhancement Program, which helps U.S.
commodities compete with other countries in the world market.
   _Availability of $5 billion annually for credit guarantees on
commodity sales to foreign countries under the government's six to
36-month credit program known as GSM-102.

<HEAD>Senate Negotiators Setting Up Bitter Floor Fight on Campaign
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate negotiators, unable to agree on
campaign spending ceilings, are likely setting up a bitter fight
before the Fourth of July recess.
   ``We're hung up on the same point we have been hung up on all
along,'' Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said after a 90-minute meeting
Thursday. ``We're just going to have to buck it up'' to the
Senate's two party leaders, George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Bob Dole,
R-Kan.
   Boren said if negotiators cannot break the deadlock on spending
limits in the next few days, he advocated bringing the issue to the
full Senate.
   `We may need to take some votes to get the negotiations going
forward,'' he said.
   Mitchell had vowed earlier to bring a Democratic campaign
finance bill to the floor for action within the next two weeks,
with or without a compromise. Both Mitchell and Dole were expected
to meet with their negotiating teams Friday.
   Teams of five Republicans and five Democrats appointed by
Mitchell and Dole agreed on several issues that had divided them in
the past four weeks of closed-door negotiations..
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said a majority of Republicans may
now be willing to consider a package that includes a ceiling on how
much candidates can raise from outside their states, but with no
ceiling on in-state contributions.
   The same concept was proposed in March by a task force of
academic experts and campaign professionals appointed by Mitchell
and Dole.
   But Republicans balked at any kind of ceiling on contributions
and Democrats insisted on limits in bills the two parties brought
to the Senate floor last month.
   Boren said Democrats are willing to abandon their call for a
public financing scheme in which taxpayers could voluntarily pay an
extra $3 a year when filling out their returns to pay for about
half the cost of congressional campaigns.
   He also said Democrats are willing to outlaw political action
committees, as the Republicans proposed in their bill, and at least
make unions publicly disclose the estimated $45 million in
unreported funds they spend on get-out-the-vote and other political
efforts.
   However, he said all those concessions are conditional upon
Republicans accepting some kind of spending limit.
   ``Everybody on the Democratic side made it clear we are not
going to let public financing or zeroing out PACs stand in the way
of an agreement,'' Boren said. ``But we cannot yield on overall
spending limits.''
   Both Boren and Nickles acknowledged that the rough agreements on
specific issues forged by the negotiators, particularly a cap on
aggregate contributions from outside a candidate's state, lack
unanimous support on either side.
   ``There's still a lot of flexibility,'' Nickles said. ``There's
not too many people falling on swords on too many issues.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's announcement that he will
not run for a fourth term brought ``no movement at all'' toward a
plea bargain agreement, a source close to the defense team says.
   Jury selection is drawing to a close in Barry's cocaine and
perjury trial with no sign of a settlement in the case.
   Jury selection began June 4 and U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson has said the panel of 12 jurors plus six
alternates will be seated Monday. The pool of prospective jurors
now stands at 83 in a process that was ending at mid-day today.
   ABC News and The Washington Post filed a motion Thursday
objecting to being excluded from a portion of the jury selection
process.
   Challenges by lawyers in the case to particular jurors are
taking place in private bench conferences. The judge then announces
which prospective jurors have been excused from possible jury duty,
but the reasons are not given. ABC and the Post argue that such an
approach impinges on the First Amendment.
   ``We're just getting ready for trial,'' Barry lawyer R. Kenneth
Mundy said as he left court Thursday.
   Jesse Jackson called on Mundy and U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens
Mundy to resume plea-bargain negotiations.
   ``We certainly hope ... that there will be a move toward the
bargaining table to work out some honorable agreement under the
law,'' Jackson said after a meeting with local ministers. ``The
contrition of that speech cannot be ignored. The mayor has admitted
his problem ... and expressed his regret.''
   Barry's supporters have said the mayor bowed out of the race in
part because he hoped such a move would elicit sympathy from the
jury or push his attorney and Stephens to reach an agreement.
Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday.
   Stephens has said Barry's political plans would not affect his
determination to proceed to trial.
   The Washington Times reported today that Stephens plans to
present evidence of fraud and corruption in city government to a
new grand jury to be seated next month, raising the possibility of
new charges against Barry and other city officials.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor charge of cocaine conspiracy,
and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.
   Barry, 54, went on local television Wednesday night to announce
his long-rumored decision not to run for a fourth, four-year term.
That opens up the mayor's race to a field that includes the
district's delegate to Congress, Walter Fauntroy, as well as two
city councilmen.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Budget That's Not a Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved a fiscal 1991 budget, sort
of.
   By voice vote late Thursday, the Senate passed a budget
resolution chock full of numbers and fancy legislative language.
   But rather than an attempt at setting fiscal policy, the vote
was a procedural step toward preventing a backlog of legislation
while Congress and the White House engage in a budget summit.
   Under Senate rules, the annual spending bills needed for the
operation of government agencies cannot be considered until a final
budget resolution is adopted.
   The House on May 1 approved a $1.2 trillion budget spelling out
federal spending priorities, including a shift from military
spending to domestic programs. The Senate then stopped short
because lawmakers thought it would hamper the bipartisan budget
talks.
   ``This is simply an instrument by which we allow the
appropriations committees to move forward under Senate rules and
procedure,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn. The process ``is not over by a long shot,'' he said.
   ``A very complicated matter but not a very important event,''
said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the
Budget Committee.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., was less generous. ``It is
fundamentally a giving up on the budget process,'' he said.
   The Senate resolution approved Thursday sets a $503 billion cap,
the same as this year, on spending for domestic and defense
programs outside of entitlements and interest on the national debt.
   The resolution includes language assuming the number will be
changed and policy decisions inserted once the budget talks with
the White House are concluded.
   Both the House and Senate must agree on a single budget
resolution for it to become binding on the two chambers. It doesn't
require the president's signature.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Thursday the House did not
intend to abandon its plan. House-Senate talks are expected to
begin next week, even as the budget summit continues.

<HEAD>FCC Moves to Restrict Dial-a-Porn Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are now new federal rules intended to
keep kids from listening to dial-a-porn services.
   Under the regulations adopted Thursday by the Federal
Communications Commission, dial-a-porn companies must require
either credit card payments, access codes or scrambling, they must
notify phone companies of the adult service, and the calls must
show up on customers' phone bills.
   Phone companies, where possible, are required to block access to
the adult services unless a customer asks to have access to them.
   The new rules are designed to comply with a 1989 Supreme Court
ruling that said consenting adults may have access to indecent, but
not obscene, commercial sex messages by telephone. The high court
threw out a law passed by Congress that had banned phone sex
messages.
   In other 5-0 votes, the commission:
   _Proposed strict disclosure and access rules for companies that
provide ``dial 0'' operator services to the traveling public.
   _Proposed rules that would deny broadcast and other
communications licenses to convicted drug users who have been
denied federal benefits by a judge.
   In its dial-a-porn decision, the commission readopted rules it
had imposed in 1987. Federal law at that time said sex messages
could be transmitted to consenting adults as long as dial-a-porn
providers adopted FCC rules to deny access to minors.
   But Congress, fearing that enterprising youths still could gain
access to telephone sex messages, banned such services outright in
April 1988. The congressional action negated the 1987 FCC rules.
   In overturning that law, the Supreme Court said the statute
could apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene _
meaning ``patently offensive'' and without redeeming value _ not
merely indecent.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, noting the constitutional concerns
raised by such laws, said the FCC's ruling Thursday was ``an act of
humanity by civilized people.''
   Regarding operator-services companies, the commission said it
was acting because its survey earlier this year found significant
non-compliance with industrywide rules the FCC issued a little more
than a year ago.
   The proposed rules on the companies would include not only the
companies that contract with long-distance carriers to provide pay
phone and hotel service, but also the owners of the business
premises themselves.

<TEXT>
   A constitutional amendment that would require
a balanced federal budget has won approval from the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   The panel voted 11-3 on Thursday to send the amendment to the
full Senate.
   If approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the House, and then
by 38 states, the amendment would prohibit federal spending from
exceeding revenues except in time of war or if both chambers waive
the requirement by a 60 percent vote.
   The amendment also would require that a majority of each chamber
of Congress _ instead of just a majority of those present and
voting _ approve any tax increase.
   The amendment would take effect in the second fiscal year after
ratification.
   Balanced-budget amendments have been approved before by the
committee. The provision most recently was subjected to a full
Senate vote in 1986 and failed by one vote. It passed the Senate in
1982 but died in the House.
   Thursday's action came as House, Senate and White House
negotiators continued their budget ``summit'' in the Capitol, aimed
at reducing the federal deficit. Democrats and Republicans have
been unable to agree on how to bring the fiscal gap below $100
billion.

   President Bush has recognized America's
fathers as playing ``a very important role in shaping the character
of our nation.''
   In a proclamation noting Sunday's celebration of Fathers Day,
Bush said Thursday the day is a time to ``thank dads everywhere for
all they do.''
   ``As children, we cannot fully fathom the depth of our father's
love for us. Neither can we fully realize the weight of his
responsibilities,'' said the president, himself a father of five
and grandfather of 12.
   Children rarely ``perceive in their father's tender gaze the
worries, frustrations and concerns'' that are a part of parenting,
the proclamation said.
   ``With each passing year, and especially as we have children of
our own, we become ever more grateful for our father's love and
discipline, and for the many sacrifices he has made. We begin to
see clearly how being a father requires faith and fortitude,'' Bush
said.
   Father's Day is a time to ``thank dads everywhere for all they
do, throughout the year, for our families and country,'' Bush said.

   Senate Democrats have dropped the idea of
trying to override President Bush's veto of the $2 billion Amtrak
bill.
   The House last week voted overwhelmingly to override but on
Tuesday the Senate failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to
pass the bill over the president's objections.
   The vote would have been 65-35, except Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, voted on the president's side so that he could,
under Senate rules, ask for a reconsideration of the vote. Only
members of the winning side may ask for a second look, and Mitchell
promptly did so.
   But apparently the Democrats could not find the two additional
votes they needed.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Nebr., chairman of the Commerce
Committee's subcommittee on surface transportation, said Thursday
night that the Democrats would propose a new bill deleting the
provision which drew the veto, an expansion of Interstate Commerce
Commission power to regulate railroad takeovers.
   Bush has vetoed 11 bills, and has yet to be overridden by
Congress.

   Gulf Coast residents braced for tar
balls to wash ashore today from a 30-mile oil slick left by the
burning Mega Borg.
   No one knew Thursday where the globs of tar would wash up, but
the west end of Galveston was a likely spot, Coast Guard Capt.
Thomas Greene said.
   State officials were to dump oil-eating bacteria on the brown
slick today.
   The Norwegian supertanker continued to spew oil today from a
tank ruptured by a fire whose cause is the subject of a hearing in
its third day.
   The Mega Borg's chief engineer said Thursday at the hearing that
one of the ship's pumps had been leaking fuel about six hours
before the first explosion rocked the ship late last Friday and
triggered a series of fiery blasts.
   Norway consul general Erik Leikvang, who convened the hearing in
Galveston, played down the information, saying, ``The leak may seem
an obvious factor to some, but it may not be obvious to the
experts.''
   Some tar balls ranging from 1 foot to 18 inches in diameter
washed ashore Thursday on the west end of Galveston. Officials
could not say whether they occurred naturally, came from previous
spills or washed in from the Mega Borg.
   ``Tar balls are ugly but they're not that environmentally
damaging,'' said B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne III, chairman of the Texas
Water Commission.
   Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro said 500 volunteers were
prepared to scour beaches.
   Mauro and Wynne were to head the experimental operation to
spread oil-eating bacteria on the spill. The process, called
bioremediation, uses naturally occurring bacteria to reduce oil to
an emulsion of fatty acids that are consumed by marine life.
   Bioremediation has been used in waste spills, but not in open
waters to clean up oil, officials said.
   The Mega Borg, which was carrying 38 million gallons of light
African crude, has lost about 3 million gallons since the
explosion, but officials said most of that has either burned or
evaporated.
   Salvage crews said they skimmed more than 76,000 gallons of oil
from the waters around the vessel 57 miles from Galveston.
   Four fireboats showered the Mega Borg with water cannons and the
rear section remained awash. The flow of oil from a hole in the
vessel's 5.5 million center tank apparently slackened, officials
said.
   Salvage crews today planned to transfer oil from the ruptured
tank into an empty tank to stop the flow, cut off the fuel to the
fire and correct the listing of the ship.
   Two men were killed in the explosion and two others who remain
missing are believed to be dead. Seventeen others were injured,
none seriously.
   The ship's chief engineer, Balinder Singh, told the Norwegian
maritime inquiry that a pump, located in the pump room where the
explosion is believed to have originated, leaked as the tanker's
oil was being transferred to a smaller ship.
   He said he stopped the leak by tightening a coupling about six
hours before the explosion.
   Lars Foyen, a representative of Det Norske Veritas, the
Norwegian equivalent of the American Bureau of Shipping, testified
that 14 pieces of machinery, including pumps used to transfer the
oil cargo, were overdue for inspection.
   Aasmund Saglokken, a former tanker captain and field expert on
the investigative board, said the leak should not be blown out of
proportion.
   ``We can't draw any conclusions from this,'' Saglokken said.

<HEAD>Quebec Court Imposes Long Sentences in Cocaine Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian court has sent a warning to drug
traffickers by imposing stiff jail sentences of up to 25 years on a
New Yorker and two Colombians who smuggled millions of dollars
worth of cocaine into the country.
   Prosecutors say the case involved the biggest cocaine seizure in
the country's history.
   ``A strong and clear message should be sent to anyone _ Canadian
or not _ who gets involved with hard-drug offenses: that they will
not be treated leniently in Canada,'' Justice Jacques Ducros of
Quebec Superior Court said Thursday.
   He also said he was imposing long sentences because of the large
quantity of drugs involved in the seizure.
   At the time of the arrests, police seized cocaine estimated to
be worth between $200 million and $250 million.
   The three were arrested April 1989 after undercover police
intercepted a shipment of 1,100 pounds of cocaine flown from
Colombia to Montreal and replaced most of the drug with brown sugar
in an elaborate sting operation.
   One defendant, 24-year-old Richardo Delgado Marquez of New York,
was sentenced Thursday to 25 years for conspiracy. He also received
10 years for possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.
   Delgado Marquez has spent much of his life in Colombia.
   A second defendant, 27-year-old Fernando William Mendoza Salazar
of Colombia, received 22 years in prison on charges of conspiracy.
He was sentenced to 10 years for possession of cocaine as well.
   Flor E. Mery-Correa, 32, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for
conspiracy and 10 years for possession of cocaine for the purpose
of trafficking. She lives in Medellin, Colombia, that country's
drug-trafficking capital.
   Their sentences are to be served concurrently, and defense
lawyers said they plan to appeal. The trio was found guilty two
weeks ago.
   Two pilots involved in the trafficking operation were each
sentenced in November to 22 years in prison.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens Against Yen, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 154.52 yen, up 0.99 yen from
Thursday's close of 153.53 yen. After opening at 154.50 yen, it
ranged between 154.25 yen and 154.60 yen.
   About $7.44 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Thursday's $15.9 billion.
   The dollar opened higher after its overnight advance against
most major currencies on overseas markets except New York, where it
closed at 154.20 yen, down from 154.75 yen on Wednesday.
   The dollar then stayed in a narrow range as many traders stayed
on the sidelines, said Masahiro Yamagida, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   ``Everyone is basically awaiting the release of U.S. trade
figures,'' said Kozo Yoshida of Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was to announce the nation's
merchandise trade figures for April later today.
   Some traders said they expected the U.S. trade deficit would
decline significantly from the previous month's
larger-than-expected $8.45 billion deficit.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 129.71 points, or 0.40 percent, to close the week at
32,538.40. The Nikkei index rose 296.34 points on Thursday.
   Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, an analyst with Daiwa Securities, said the
yen's weakness and rising interest rates depressed many investors,
prompting small-lot selling.
   He said the day's trading was thin without fresh incentives.
   Volume traded on the market's first section totaled 450 million
shares, unchanged from the previous day.
   In bond dealings, benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 87.79 points, down from Thursday's close of 88.09.
Their yield rose to 7.015 percent from the previous day's 6.955
percent.

   It'll be a long time before Dana King gets
to borrow his mother's car again. Maybe about a dozen years _ when
he's old enough to drive it.
   The 3-year-old boy took a wild ride through his neighborhood
Thursday afternoon when he climbed into his mother's car, which was
parked on a steep hill in front of their house, and shifted it into
neutral.
   ``I heard the horn, I went out and it was halfway down the
hill,'' said his shocked mother, Brenda King, 24. ``I was
terrified. I thought I had lost him.''
   The car, which traveled about 300 yards, went down the street,
jumped a curb, knocked over a fire hydrant and sent water spraying,
vaulted a construction ditch, skimmed past a house, hit a railing
and stopped halfway across a retaining wall with the front half
hanging six feet off the ground.
   Although his mother was shaken and breathless, Dana came off
without a scratch. In fact, she said, he was laughing.

<TEXT>
   A gang of miners attacking government opponents in
Romania's capital stormed the house of an opposition leader,
ransacked the home, beat his colleagues and briefly detained him,
he said today.
   Ion Ratiu, head of the Romanian National Peasant Party, told
British Broadcasting Corp. television that he had fled his home
when the trouble in Bucharest started, and returned after receiving
assurances from the government that he would be safe.
   But shortly after Ratiu returned Thursday night, a gang of
miners broke in, beat up his associates and took him away. He was
later released.
   ``When they caught me they said, `Oh, we've got you, criminal.'
And I said, `Why do you say that I'm a criminal?' I didn't show any
fear and probably that is what saved me from being roughed up,''
Ratiu said.
   The television showed pictures of Ratiu's home in shambles,
furniture turned over and papers strewn across the floor. Many
personal belongings had been stolen, the report said.
   Late Thursday night, Ratiu's son, Nicolae, called Western news
agencies in London to report the attack. He said men who claimed to
be police were operating with the miners.
   In Bucharest, Health Ministry officials said Thursday that at
least five people were killed and 350 injured in two days of
violence between supporters and opponents of the governing National
Salvation Front.
   The front, largely composed of former Communists, spearheaded
the December revolution that toppled former dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. It is headed by President-elect Ion Iliescu, whose
appeal for help brought the miners into Bucharest Thursday.

   Michigan motorists won't see sobriety
checkpoints on the state's roads anytime soon, even though the U.S.
Supreme Court approved their use.
   Bethany Goodman, executive director of the Michigan chapter of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said she had hoped Thursday's 6-3
ruling would mean roadblocks could be used by the Fourth of July
weekend.
   ``I believe that a lot of lives would have been saved had a stop
not been put on the implementation of sobriety check lanes,'' she
said, ``and the sooner the better that we get these things
implemented.''
   But the issue first returns to the Michigan Court of Appeals to
determine if the tactic violates the state constitution.
   ``We've always considered our chances under the Michigan
Constitution were better than under the U.S. Constitution,'' said
Mark Granzotto, general counsel for the American Civil Liberties
Union in Michigan. The organization challenged the checkpoints on
behalf of six lawmakers.
   The appeals court could take a year or more to rule, MADD legal
counsel Michael Rizik Jr. said.
   The checkpoints were used just once in Michigan, in May 1986
under an executive order from Gov. James Blanchard. Wayne County
Circuit Court Judge Michael Stacey quickly barred them with an
injunction.
   ``I hope everyone understands how dangerous and
precedent-setting the (Supreme Court) decision is,'' said Howard
Simon, executive director of the Michigan ACLU.
   Checkpoint supporters say they will be an effective tool in
fighting drunken driving, which killed 705 people in Michigan in
1988, the last full year for which the state police had figures.
   Critics say other methods of catching drunken drivers or keeping
them off the road are more efficient. Dissenting Supreme Court
Justice John Paul Stevens called checkpoints ``elaborate, and
disquieting, publicity stunts'' that do little if anything to
improve highway safety.
   In Michigan's only checkpoint, in May 1986 on a state highway,
126 drivers were stopped. Of two detained for further examination,
one was arrested.
   An appeals court upheld Stacey's ruling barring the checkpoints.
The Michigan Supreme Court declined to step in and state Attorney
General Frank Kelley asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.
   ``I was confident from the beginning that the stopping and
observing of drivers at check lanes is no more a constitutional
intrusion of privacy than security checks at airports and public
buildings such as the Supreme Court,'' Kelley said.
   Democratic state Rep. Morris Hood, who has sponsored a bill that
would prohibit all Michigan law enforcement agencies from setting
up checkpoints, countered, ``An intrusion is an intrusion.''
   ``There is no such thing as minimal intrusion,'' he said.

   Foreign Minister David Levy was in good
condition today after being hospitalized in a cardiac intensive
care unit for chest pains, hospital officials said.
   Tests showed that the 52-year-old Levy did not have a heart
attack, said Dr. Udi Cantor of Haemek Hospital in the northern town
of Afula.
   Levy arrived at the hospital late Thursday from his home in
nearby Beit Shean.
   Dozens of well-wishers called the hospital, but doctors ordered
that no phone calls be transferred to the foreign minister's room.
   ``But if Baker calls, we will transfer the call,'' Cantor added.
   He was referring to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
who, in testimony Wednesday, recited the White House telephone
number and urged Israeli officials to call ``when you're serious
about peace.''
   An Israel radio reporter ended a report on Levy today with the
remarks: ``For the information of Secretary Baker, the number here
is Afula 06-524-141.''
   The Moroccan-born Levy, a fiery orator, is regarded as a
possible successor to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the
right-wing Likud bloc.

<HEAD>Risky Business: High Schoolers' Sex Habits, Ignorance Could Mean
Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``large number'' of American high school
students are at risk of AIDS because of their drug use and sexual
practices, according to federal health researchers looking at 42
new youth surveys.
   The surveys, taken in schools in various cities and states, also
found continued ignorance among a large number of high schoolers
regarding what does and doesn't cause AIDS. For example, in most
surveys, less than half the kids knew that mosquito bites don't
cause the disease.
   ``The levels of misinformation are truly concerning, but not
knowing that a mosquito bite does not cause AIDS doesn't put a
student at risk for AIDS,'' said Dr. Laura Kann of the Centers for
Disease Control. ``We are most concerned about the findings related
to sex and drug use.''
   The 1989 surveys reported Thursday by the CDC were conducted in
30 states, 10 U.S. cities and two U.S. territories.
   Between 7 percent and 40 percent of the students reported having
four or more sex partners. Between 2 percent and 5 percent said
they had injected cocaine, heroin or other intravenous drugs.
   Since the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS is
spread through sex and sharing of drug needles, Kann said: ``There
are a large number of students throughout the United States that
are at risk for HIV infection because of the behaviors they
practice.
   ``We need to do a better job of providing students with HIV
education that would help them avoid behaviors that put them at
risk.''
   The surveys indicated at least some students knew they were
taking risks. Between 93 percent and 100 percent in the various
surveys knew that AIDS can be transmitted by drug needles, and
between 74 percent and 98 percent knew that it can be spread by sex
without use of condoms.
   Misconceptions about AIDS are still common. Only 32 percent to
75 percent in the various surveys said correctly that AIDS cannot
be acquired by giving blood. Between 22 percent and 67 percent knew
that AIDS doesn't come from mosquito bites. And between 44 percent
and 85 percent knew that public toilets don't spread AIDS.
   The findings, both in behavior and awareness, were similar to
those in a smaller group of surveys conducted in 1988.
   The surveys from the participating cities and states do not
represent a national sampling. And state-by-state comparisons of
the results are not statistically relevant, the Atlanta-based CDC
said, because different locations reported different response rates
and some may have asked only some questions to some students.

<HEAD>Oil Spill Spreads To Major Port</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A huge oil slick caused by the collision of two
freighters has floated near the mouth of a leading northeastern
port, officials said today.
   The 40-square-mile slick is near the Dalian port and is
continuing to move east in the direction of North Korea, Zhu Li of
the Dalian Marine Safety Supervision Bureau said in a telephone
interview.
   The State Oceanography Bureau in Beijing said it was China's
largest oil spill ever from an ocean vessel, but it could not
assess the seriousness of the environmental damage.
   The spill has received little attention in the official media
and there has been no outcry over responsibility.
   The spill was caused by the June 8 collision of two
Japanese-owned freighters in the Bohai Gulf, east of Tianjin. One
vessel, the Maya 8, sank and began leaking its fuel oil. It was not
carrying any cargo.
   The second ship, the Spring Falcon, loaded with magnesium ore,
rescued the Maya 8's crew and continued its journey to Japan.
   Both the Oceanography Bureau and the Marine Safety Supervision
Bureau said they did not know how much oil the Maya 8 was carrying.
The People's Daily, which reported the slick's spread to near
Dalian, said that as of Thursday oil continued to leak from the
vessel but the flow had slowed.
   The slick near Dalian appeared to be only one portion of the oil
leak. Initial reports after the collision said oil was covering
more than 480 square miles.
   Ms. Zhu said she did not know whether the spill would affect
shipping and fishing in the gulf.
   She said that by cutting off the oxygen supply to the water, the
oil spill had produced a red tide _ a proliferation of red
organisms that can harm fish and plant life.
   Efforts are being made to clean up the oil, she said, but she
could give no details. She did not know the cost of the cleanup.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Prosecutors' Stand on Seized Noriega Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government must return millions of dollars of
Manuel Noriega's assets unless it can prove he obtained them
illegally, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Thursday rejected
prosecutors' claims that the U.S.-ordered seizure of at least $20
million in Noriega's assets was not subject to normal legal review
because it involved treaties with third countries.
   ``The power of the executive to deal with foreign governments is
unquestionably great, but it does not extend so far as to impinge
on a criminal defendant's right to due process,'' the judge said.
   Hoeveler warned that if the U.S. attorney's office balks at
having to prove the money was illegally obtained, he will order it
released. The judge set a hearing for Wednesday.
   The issue arose when Noriega's attorneys asked to withdraw from
the case, saying they could no longer work because the government
had taken all of the former Panamanian leader's assets.
   Prosecutors tried to pay the defense attorneys directly, but the
deal fell through. The defense attorneys then asked the judge to
order the government to release the assets so they could pursue the
expensive case.
   The defense has estimated the government will spend almost $40
million on the Noriega trial, and says it will need about $5
million.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
prosecutors had no immediate comment.
   Defense attorneys hailed the ruling.
   ``It's a huge victory,'' lead Noriega attorney Frank Rubino
said. ``This is a unique order _ he's saying he will order this
money freed if the government doesn't want to act.''
   The judge said the failure of the government to justify the
seizures effectively deprives Noriega of his constitutional right
to counsel and protections against illegal search and seizure.
   The government acknowledges freezing 27 Noriega-linked bank
accounts valued at about $20 million. During the December invasion
of Panama, troops also found $5.8 million in cash in Noriega's
quarters, which it turned over to the new Panamanian government.
The defense says U.S. troops also took homes, cars and other
property.
   Rubino said he welcomed the chance to show those assets were
legally earned, noting the defense has long claimed Noriega
received $11 million from U.S. intelligence agencies.
   ``We are ready, willing and able to show General Noriega has
received substantial amounts of money from various intelligence
agencies, which is not tainted or drug money,'' said Rubino.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops Jan. 4, is being held in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami on a February
1988 indictment accusing him of taking $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way station
for cocaine trafficking.

   Lee Sharapa says she felt like a freak after
cancer surgery disfigured her face, but the 44-year-old homemaker
fought back with help from a loving family and a support group
called Let's Face It.
   The surgery five years ago destroyed the symmetry of Mrs.
Sharapa's face. She said many of her friends didn't understood what
it was like to be stared at on the street.
   Today, Mrs. Sharapa has come to terms with looking different and
is helping others with facial disfigurements feel less isolated
through the group at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center.
   ``I think the group is going to be very, very beneficial,'' Mrs.
Sharapa said. ``Just (in terms of) self-esteem. To make a person
know that they're not the only one in this boat.''
   Three people attended the first meeting Tuesday. Mrs. Sharapa
hopes it will grow to as many as 20 people. Similar groups meet
elsewhere in the United States and other countries, including
Britain, the home of Christine Piff, who wrote a book called
``Let's Face It'' after her own cancer surgery.
   Chicago nurse Laurel Barbour decided to start the Michael Reese
group after attending a medical meeting in New Orleans where she
met Betsy Wilson, who founded Let's Face It in the United States
three years ago in her hometown of Concord, Mass.
   ``I think it must be awful to be facially disfigured and to have
to walk around,'' Ms. Barbour said.
   Disfigured people can get encouragement from each other that ``I
can't provide for them as a nurse at all,'' she said.
   Ms. Wilson lost her jaw to cancer surgery in 1972 and said she
drew inspiration from Ms. Piff, whose 1985 book documented the
ordeal of losing an eye and part of her palate to cancer surgery.
   Ms. Piff launched a Let's Face It movement in Great Britain to
counter the insensitivity she was subjected to.
   An estimated 350,000 people in the United States each year
suffer facially disfiguring injuries, diseases, burns or surgeries,
Ms. Wilson said in a telephone interview this week.
   ``A lot of people just become reclusive or alcoholic, and they
die that way, in seclusion,'' she said. ``This is what's exciting
about this. It's given a lot of people a lot of hope. We're able to
share our humor and our humanity together, young and old.''
   Massachusetts-based Let's Face It has no formal membership but
mails newsletters to about 4,000 people. It is merging with a
Canadian counterpart, a Toronto-based group called About Face, Ms.
Wilson said.
   ``There are (similar) groups all over the United States with
different names,'' she said, including an Indianapolis organization
called Face to Face, which runs a weekend camp for facially
disfigured youngsters.
   ``One of our goals is to educate the public to value the person
behind the face,'' said Ms. Wilson, who appeared on the ``Oprah''
TV show in December and has made other public appearances to
support the cause.
   Another goal is to educate the disfigured themselves, she said,
including teaching them how to interpret people's reactions.
   ``Most children stare at you because they think you hurt. It's
compassion, not cruel curiosity,'' Ms. Wilson said.
   Dr. Norman Bernstein, clinical associate in surgery and
psychiatry at the University of Chicago who has worked with
disfigured patients for 30 years, blamed society for many of their
problems.
   ``Our society and most societies are frightened and troubled and
angered by people who do not look right,'' he said. ``Television
has made it worse, with all those millions of dollars in
advertising about appearance.''
   Mrs. Sharapa said living with disfigurement once seemed
overwhelming at times, but she has come to regard it as ``just part
of life'' with the help of a loving family and friends.
   ``To me, I'm no different inside than I was five, 10 years
ago,'' she said. ``Maybe this has made me a stronger person, a
better person. I hope it has.''

<HEAD>Governor: Abortion Bill Too Cruel Without Exceptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana's House passed the nation's
toughest state abortion bill and sent it to the Senate, but Gov.
Buddy Roemer promises a veto unless exceptions are made for victims
of rape and incest.
   The House voted 74-27 Thursday to sentence people to up to 10
years in prison for performing abortions. The House twice rejected
amendments with the exceptions Roemer wants.
   ``A bill that treats rape and incest for what they are _
unusual, extraordinary, violent, degrading _ and gives the mother a
choice there, I can live with that,'' the Democratic governor said.
   Proponents of the measure said they hope the conservative U.S.
Supreme Court eventually will receive the bill and use it to
overturn the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   State Rep. Woody Jenkins, the bill's Democratic sponsor, said he
can't concern himself yet with Roemer's long-standing veto threat.
   ``The governor will have to consider it and make the decision
himself,'' Jenkins said. ``If he would veto the bill, we would
certainly try to override it.''
   The Louisiana Legislature hasn't overridden a veto in 70 years,
Jenkins said.
   The bill could be in trouble in the Senate, where a number of
lawmakers agree with Roemer, said Sen. Mike Cross. He will handle
the measure when it comes up for a Senate vote, expected in about
two weeks. The Senate bill might contain exceptions for rape and
incest.
   The House bill would impose prison terms of up to 10 years and
fines of up to $100,000 on people who perform abortions. It would
not penalize women who receive abortions.
   Jenkins has claimed that abortion is tantamount to abuse against
women. He focused debate on whether life begins at conception and
repeatedly referred to House committee testimony to that effect by
Dr. Jerome Lejeune, a French geneticist.
   The Louisiana Legislature has a history of enacting tough
abortion laws, all of which have been stayed or declared
unconstitutional during the past 15 years.
   Opponents called the measure an affront to women, especially the
poor.
   ``What the House has done will awaken a strong majority in this
state,'' said Robin Rothrock, leader of an abortion rights
coalition. ``People will come to this Capitol and tell the
Legislature to stay out of our business.''

   Torrential rains pounded Nebraska early today during a series of
thunderstorms in the central Plains. Rain fell over parts of the
East and the northern Plains.
   Fair weather prevailed over much of the West.
   In the East, showers drenched northern New England and
thunderstorms hit Philadelphia. Rain also fell in western
Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.
   Hot and muggy weather was expected from the southern Plains
across the Southeast. Showers and thunderstorms were likely in the
central Appalachians and Carolina coastal areas.
   Much of the Midwest and northern Plains early today had rain or
thunderstorms. Rain fell in Minnesota and North Dakota and
thunderstorms were over Iowa and Nebraska.
   Torrential rains drenched eastern Nebraska, forcing the
evacuation of the town of Platte Center, which has a population of
367, police said. Flooding swept cars from a parking lot and cars
blocked highways, the National Weather Service said.
   No deaths or injuries were reported.
   Thursday was the third night of severe weather to pound Nebraska.
   In Kansas on Thursday, a tornado in Osborne County damaged a
farm building, uprooted trees and downed several power poles.
Another tornado touched down at Whichita, but caused no damage,
police said.
   Softball-size hail was reported near El Dorado, Kan., and winds
gusted up to 70 mph, authorities said.
   There was 5 inches of snow at Monida Pass in southwest Montana.
   The high Thursday in the Lower 48 states was 106 degrees at
Presidio, Texas.

   Doctors at St. John's Hospital have
sent Elizabeth Taylor home to recuperate after a two-month battle
with illness that nearly claimed her life.
   The violet-eyed actress, with hair coiffed and makeup on, waved
and smiled to reporters Thursday night as she drove from the
hospital in a red, compact car toward her Beverly Hills home.
   ``She's so happy to be going home, she's very excited,'' said
spokeswoman Chen Sam.
   Miss Taylor, 58, will recuperate at home for a couple of months,
Ms. Sam said.
   The New York publicist quoted Miss Taylor as saying, ``I am
finally glad to be going home. My sole concern at this time is
focused on my getting well and carrying on with my life.
   ``Throughout this experience, I have learned how precious life
is, how much I love it and yearn to live more of it. I am grateful
to everyone who has supported me through this difficult period.''
   Miss Taylor had been in St. John's since April 16. She had been
in the hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of viral
pneumonia. At one point in late April, her breathing was assisted
by a ventilator.
   She first entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with
a persistent fever and a sinus infection, doctors said. When her
condition worsened, she was transferred to St. John's.
   On April 17, Miss Taylor responded to persistent rumors and
issued a statement saying she had been tested for the AIDS virus
and the tests were negative. A pulmonary specialist at St. John's
said her life was in jeopardy the weekend of April 21-22, when she
was put on the respirator to aid her breathing.
   On May 11, her doctor announced that she had developed a yeast
infection of the blood and would undergo intravenous therapy.
   Through Ms. Sam, Miss Taylor's physician Michael Roth said,
``Though Miss Taylor has shown tremendous improvement which permits
her to leave the hospital, her overall recovery depends on a
significant period of convalescence which I believe she can do from
home.''
   The screen beauty has won two Oscars. She starred in
``Butterfield 8,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' ``Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof'' and more than 50 other films.
   From the day a 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor fell off a horse
during filming of ``National Velvet'' and hurt her back, medical
problems hounded her, sending her to hospitals for at least 19
major operations and countless treatments.
   Miss Taylor's health woes, including her near-death bouts with
pneumonia in 1961 and 1990, became as much a part of Hollywood lore
as her Oscar-winning performances and seven marriages.

   Ticket sales for a Nelson Mandela rally at
Yankee Stadium were held up for two days, until the city promised
to pay up to $50,000 if the field's turf is damaged, a newspaper
reported today.
   The rally featured the South African anti-apartheid leader is
scheduled for June 21. Tickets were supposed to go on sale Tuesday,
but sales were held up until Thursday while the city Parks
Department negotiated with Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner over
liability for possible damage to the field, the Daily News reported.
   The city agreed to pay up to $50,000 to replace any damaged
turf, the newspaper said.
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Steinbrenner, said ``George
just wanted to make certain that if the turf is destroyed, it's
replaced.''
   About 50,000 tickets, priced between $5 and $500, finally went
on sale Thursday after the agreement was signed, the newspaper said.

   The main opposition alliance has rejected
an offer to form a coalition government with the former Communists,
who are expected to win a majority in Parliament in weekend runoffs.
   Two smaller opposition parties also ruled out a coalition with
the governing Socialist Party, the heirs to the Communist Party
which ruled this Balkan nation since 1944.
   The United States said widespread voter intimidation may have
figured in last Sunday's first-round balloting, the country's first
free elections in 58 years. But Zhelyu Zhelev, leader of the
16-party opposition Union of Democratic Forces hailed the showing
the opposition alliance made in so short a time.
   Zhelev late Thursday ruled out any coalition with the Socialist
Party. The Communist Party changed its name to the Socialist Party
in April.
   Bulgaria is the only country in the Soviet Union's
disintegrating East bloc where former ruling Communists remain the
strongest political force.
   Socialist Party chief Alexander Lilov, a longtime Communist
ideologist sidelined by former Bulgarian strongman Todor Zhivkov,
reiterated at a news conference Thursday night that his party is
reluctant to go it alone.
   He called for a government of national consensus to lead
Bulgaria out of its current economirompted investors to sell shares to
take profits
chalked up earlier in the week, dealers said.
   Shortly after midday in London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 7.9 points, or 0.3 percent, at
2,395.1, its session low.
   Volume came to 241.4 million shares at midday, compared with
330.8 million shares at the same time Thursday.

   A show by the rap group 2 Live Crew wasn't as
nasty _ or as long _ as the audience wanted. But the group's leader
said it proved that 2 Live Crew could put on a clean show for
teen-agers.
   ``They said 2 Live Crew can't do a clean show and still rock.
What we're going to do is we're going to prove them all wrong,''
Luther ``Luke Skyywalker'' Campbell said during Thursday night's
performance.
   ``I consider it the PG version,'' said Gwinnett County Police
Chief Wayne Bolden as the group finished its last song. ``This is
the first rap concert I've been to and I'm kind of enjoying it. I
like the beat.''
   ``I can't see where they violated obscenity laws, but half the
words I can't understand anyway,'' he added.
   Campbell and another member of the Miami-based rap group were
arrested in Florida last weekend after they played songs from their
sexually explicit ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album at an
all-adult show. A Florida record store owner who sold the album
also was arrested.
   The arrests followed a federal judge's ruling that the album
violates Florida's obscenity law. The ruling is being appealed.
   The controversy prompted the band to cancel one of two concerts
planned at a club for teens Thursday night. Tickets sold for both
shows were honored and the band played to an estimated 320 people _
roughly half the Ozone club's capacity.
   In a brisk 35 minutes, the band performed versions of some of
the songs from ``As Clean As They Wanna Be,'' which lacks the
profanities. Each time group members stopped short of singing
vulgar lyrics, teen-agers in the audience gleefully shouted them
out.
   Ornard Howell, 18, of Duluth described the show as ``awesome.
But it was too short.''
   Another fan, Phil Sammuel II, agreed: ``I paid $16.50 for that
ticket, I need a refund. It was too short. It wasn't what I
expected.''
   During the show, Campbell held up signs that read ``no
censorship'' and lead the crowd in chants of ``no censorship'' and
``freedom of speech.''
   Campbell said the group waited to leave Miami until they had
talked to representatives of the Gwinnett County Police Department
to make sure they would be allowed to perform a clean show without
hassle. They left when they got it.
   ``The man talked to us like we were civilized people,'' Campbell
said. ``The thing is, we'll go to jail but we don't want to go to
jail for something that's real crazy. We don't want to make no
small-town sheriff a big hero.'' Bolden said he met with band
members when they arrived and ``told them about the obscenity law.
I also told them they could not play any songs from the album,''
referring to ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   He said the band thanked him for the warning.
   Chief Assistant Solicitor David Fuller had advised Gwinnett
police earlier this week that ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be''
violates Georgia's obscenity law because it contains graphic
descriptions of intercourse and sodomy.

<TEXT>
   Lyme disease, a summertime threat in the great
outdoors, is up 62 percent in a year in the United States.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
Lyme disease is up 15-fold in the seven years since nationwide
reporting began. Preliminary 1989 reports indicate 7,402 cases,
compared with 4,574 in 1988 and 491 in 1982.
   Georgia had the greatest percentage increase, with 715 cases, up
from 53 the year before. New York had the largest number of cases _
2,916, up from 2,637 a year earlier.
   Other states in the top five were Connecticut with 754, up from
362; New Jersey with 649, up from 500; and Pennsylvania with 585,
up from 306.
   For those headed outdoors this summer, preventive measures are
warranted, the CDC said. They include avoiding tick-infested areas,
using tick repellant, wearing protective clothing in the outdoors
and frequently inspecting for the small pests.
   Lyme disease, which can cause a red bulls-eye rash, aches and
nerve pain, has been found most often in the Northeastern,
mid-Atlantic, north-central and Northwestern states, the CDC said.
The disease is treated with antibiotics, but treatment can be
difficult unless it's caught early.
   In Georgia, where the disease was up 12-fold last year, it's
probable that there were indeed more Lyme disease cases _ but also
better reporting of it, state health officials said.
   ``We think one major factor was recognition,'' said Tom McKinley
of the state Office of Epidemiology. ``Also, we have had an
increased population of deer in Georgia, and also an increased
population of the deer ticks, which are responsible for
transmission.''

<HEAD>Dairy Princess Found Guilty of Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college student once honored as her
county's Dairy Princess faces life in prison after being convicted
of murder for strangling another young woman in a quarrel over a
man they both dated.
   Jurors deliberated about 7{ hours before returning the verdict
against 20-year-old Lori Esker about midnight Thursday.
   Prosecutors had argued that she was obsessed with 26-year-old
Bill Buss and plotted the Sept. 20 killing of Lisa Cihaski, his new
girlfriend.
   Conviction of first-degree intentional homicide carries a
mandatory life prison sentence. Ms. Esker will be eligible for
parole in 13 years, nine months.
   Ms. Esker wept as sheriff's deputies escorted her from the
courtroom to the Marathon County Jail today.
   Members of Ms. Cihaski's family hugged each other, some weeping,
as the verdict was announced.
   Ms. Esker ``always had to be number one and she's still number
one. She got number one,'' said Vilas Cihaski, the victim's father,
referring to the first-degree conviction.
   Ms. Esker's parents showed no emotion as the verdict was read
and their daughter was led away. They declined to comment.
   Ms. Esker's lawyer, Stephen Glynn, said strangulation is not
something ``that a jury can easily accept as unintentional.''
   Buss, who sat near the front of the courtroom, said afterward:
``My life will never return to normal again because Lisa will never
be back.''
   He was about to become engaged to Ms. Cihaski, a one-time
homecoming queen who worked as an assistant catering manager at a
motel near Wausau.
   According to testimony, Ms. Esker drove 150 miles from River
Falls, where she was a college student, waited in the parking lot
where Ms. Cihaski worked, strangled her with the victim's narrow
belt, pulled a ring off her finger and drove back to River Falls.
   Nine days later, she told investigators the killing was in
self-defense as the argument over Buss escalated.
   Friends and college classmates testified Ms. Esker repeatedly
said she hated Ms. Cihaski and would get Buss back somehow.
   Ms. Cihaski's grandmother, Ada Sigharter, said the conviction
``never brings my Lisa back but she (Ms. Esker) got what she had
coming. Our Lisa was just a super gal. There were no skeletons in
her closet, no way.''
   Ms. Esker surrendered her crown as 1989 Marathon County Dairy
Princess _ an award based on talent and leadership in agriculture _
after her arrest last September.
   ``I can't really say I feel joy over something like this,''
District Attorney Greg Grau said. ``It is just a terrible case, a
tragedy. ... I just hope that some of the wounds that have existed
in the community because of the case can now start to heal and
people can get it behind them and go on.''
   He again reiterated that intent was the issue.
   The length of time Ms. Esker had to hold a belt around Ms.
Cihaski's throat before she died _ 2 to 8 minutes _ proved Ms.
Esker intended to kill her, Grau had told the jury in closing
arguments.
   Ms. Esker's lawyer intends to appeal. ``It is a real tough
situation seeing somebody that young who is potentially going to be
in prison for a very long time for something I am absolutely
convinced she did not intend,'' Glynn said.

<HEAD>Mazola Stops Ads After Claims Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Mazola Corn Oil announced that
it would drop claims that imply the product reduces cholesterol.
   CPC International Inc., based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said
Thursday it had signed agreements with the Federal Trade Commission
and attorneys general in 10 states.
   In a statement, CPC said its future advertisements would avoid
the ``use of statements which might be misinterpreted to mean that
the use of corn oil would, by itself, lower serum cholesterol.''
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said he and his
colleagues challenged ads that made claims such as, ``Mazola does
what? They said it could turn back my cholesterol. I didn't believe
it until my level dropped 17 percent.''
   The states alleged that the advertisements stressed the
cholesterol lowering properties of these products without placing
proper emphasis on the importance of the total diet.
   ``Today's consumers want to eat right and they are often swayed
by the claims made by food producers,'' Shannon said. ``But any
food touted as a magic cure without stressing the need for an
all-around healthy diet does consumers more harm than good.''
   CPC said the ads in question already had been withdrawn for
other reasons months ago. The company said it continues to believe
that the interpretation of the advertising by the states and FTC
``does not reflect consumer understanding of this advertising.''
   The company also said it has supplied numerous studies
supporting its position that a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet which
includes Mazola Corn Oil can help lower cholesterol levels.
   CPC did not admit any violations of law, and said it was trying
to avoid expensive legal proceedings.
   The agreement calls for the company to pay $100,000 to cover the
costs of the investigation, Shannon's office said.
   The other states involved in the action were California,
Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas and
Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Victory Shakes North Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Algerians switching to
traditional dress, demands that alcohol sales be curtailed. Pickup
7th, `In final...'
^By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</NOTE>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Islamic fundamentalists who scored a
surprise victory in local elections told bar owners today to
curtail alcohol sales, and many Algerians abandoned Western garb
for traditional dress.
   Hundreds of fundamentalists staged all-night celebrations in the
capital, parading through the streets with banners reading ``God is
great'' and ``Islamic Republic.''
   ``The army and people are with you, Madani!'' youths shouted,
referring to Sheikh Abassi Madani, leader of the Islamic Salvation
Front, which decisively won Tuesday's elections. It was the first
free vote in Algeria since independence from France in 1962.
   Many men who normally wear Western clothing appeared on the
streets today in the traditional floor-length shirt, or khamiss.
   Some cafe owners reported visits by fundamentalists.
   Omar Ghermache, who runs the well-known La Pecherie restaurant,
said a band of young men wearing khamisses and beards advised him
``to serve alcohol from now on only to Europeans.''
   Madani has said women will not be forced to wear the Islamic
scarf, or hijab, but his followers have steadily pressured female
students and teachers to adopt the traditional garb.
   The government has not yet replied to the demands of Madani to
dissolve Parliament and hold early national elections. It also has
not responded to suggestions that the governing National Liberation
Front propose a coalition with the fundamentalists.
   The National Liberation Front was Algeria's only legal political
party until constitutional reforms were implemented last year.
   In final results announced Thursday by Interior Minister Mohamed
Salah Mohammedi, the Islamic Salvation Front won 853 of the 1,539
municipal councils at stake.
   The National Liberation Front carried 487, and the anti-clerical
Rally for Culture and Democracy gained 87. The rest went to small
parties and independents.
   The fundamentalists captured 32 provincial councils, Mohammedi
added. The governing party took 14, the Rally for Culture and
Democracy one, and independent candidates one.
   The turnout was 65 percent of the 12.8 million registered
voters, an unusually low total for Algeria. Two parties opposed to
both the governing party and the fundamentalists boycotted the
elections.
   Madani told the French TV network TF-1 that Algeria was in no
danger of being swept by radical Iranian fundamentalism. ``We are
Moslems _ not fundamentalists,'' he said.
   However, his party advocates the use of Islamic law and
restricts women to a subservient role.
   Fundamentalists in other North African countries hailed the
results of the election.
   In Tunisia, the leader of the unauthorized Islamic
Fundamentalist Party, Rachid Ghannounchi, said the election ``was a
divine day, by the grace of God, which will have consequences for
the entire Maghreb.''
   The Maghreb consists of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and
Mauritania.
   Fundamentalist opposition leaders in Morocco hailed the results.
The Al Alam newspaper said the June 12 election day will stand as a
major date in history.
   Iran's official Tehran Radio said Algerian voters ``have given
proof of the fact that the great force of Islam is a decisive
factor in political life of all North African countries.''
   ``In this favorable terrain, Islam can spread very quickly,''
the radio said. Iran's government came to power in a 1979 Islamic
revolution.
   Moderate governments from Egypt to Morocco appeared reluctant to
comment on the election results. But the Moroccan newspaper Al
Bayane, usually close to government thinking, said that democratic
reform in Algeria had benefited ``a movement known for its
authoritarian and intolerant leanings.''
   ``The entire union of the Arab Maghreb is shaken by the way in
which its central pivot, Algeria, has been rendered fragile,'' it
said.
   Libya bans Islamic fundamentalism and Egypt suppresses it,
although the Moslem Brotherhood holds seats in Egypt's parliament.
   In Algiers, the uncertain political future dominated
conversation Thursday. Many Algerians are anxious to know whether
the military will remain on the sidelines and how women will be
affected by the fundamentalists' gains.
   In France, extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen predicted a
flood of new Algerian immigrants fleeing Islamic repression. Le Pen
favors expelling the Moslem immigrants already in France.
   Politicians across the spectrum said fear of a new wave of
immigrants would benefit Le Pen's National Front at the ballot box.
   ``One extremism creates another,'' remarked centrist politician
Jacques Barrot. ``We've got to break this vicious circle.''

   Government troops killed at least 22
Tamil rebels today in attacks in northern and eastern Sri Lanka
that occurred shortly after five soldiers died in a guerrilla
ambush, military officials said.
   A senior government minister flew to the rebel stronghold of
Jaffna, seeking an end to five days of bloodshed.
   The deaths brought to about 270 the number of people killed
since Monday. The fighting is the worst since peace talks began in
May 1989 between the government and the rebels, who are seeking an
independent Tamil state.
   Earlier today, the military said Tamil guerrillas, known as
Tigers, killed at least 23 of 69 policemen captured when rebels
overran a police station in Kinniya in northeastern Trincomalee
district on Wednesday.
   It was the second reported mass killing of captured police
officers during the latest outbreak of violence. About 114
policemen, who surrendered Monday at the eastern Kalmunai police
station in eastern Sri Lanka, were lined up on the ground and shot
and killed by rebels, a surviving policeman said.
   Witnesses have said an additional 110 government troops, rebels
and civilians have been killed in the fighting throughout Sri
Lanka's embattled northeast.
   Today, troops struck back at rebels, recapturing several of the
20 police staions taken by rebels and chasing guerrillas out of at
least two communities. Earlier today, five soldiers died and one
was injured when rebels ambushed a jeep patrol south of Vavuniya,
135 miles northeast of Colombo, officials said.
   At least six rebels were killed when troops recaptured two
police stations and cleared guerrillas out of Trincomalee, a
seaport town, officials said. Twelve rebels were killed when troops
recaptured the police station in Muttur, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   Police commandos also recaptured Pottuvil police station in
eastern Sri Lanka, killing four guerrillas, officials said.
   And troops cleared Northern Vavuniya of rebels, officials said.
   Justice Minister Shahul Hameed left Colombo, the capital, this
morning for the rebel stronghold of Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka to
meet Tamil Tiger rebel leaders in an effort to end the fighting.
   But elsewhere, rebels continued their attacks on at least four
army camps and a police station, the officials said.
   Ten soldiers at a camp on a pier at Talaimannar in the northwest
were injured when they came under heavy fire overnight before
escaping to a naval base, officials said. The other army camps
under attack were Kiran, Kalavanchukudi and Muttur on the east
coast. Rebels also attacked a police station in the east, officials
said.
   This week's fighting shattered a cease-fire that took effect
when the government and rebels opened negotiations 13 months ago to
end the 7-year-old Tamil revolt against the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, represent 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. They claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the Tamil-dominated north and
east after India withdrew its peacekeeping force in March after an
unsuccessful 32-month mission to disarm the rebels.
   The latest round of fighting began after a Tamil man told the
Tigers he was assaulted by a Sinhalese policeman at the Batticaloa
police station on Sunday.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,200 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil war since it started in 1983. Another
6,000 have been killed in violence instigated by Sinhalese
extremists who claim the government has been too weak in dealing
with the Tamils.

<HEAD>Pope Meets Mandela and Blesses Efforts to End Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today received black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and gave his blessings to efforts
to dismantle the apartheid system of racial segregation in South
Africa.
   The pope did not respond directly to Mandela's request that the
Holy See support mantaining international economic sanctions on
South Africa. The sanctions aim to pressure the white-minority
government to end apartheid.
   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the Vatican considers
sanctions a political issue but that apartheid was an ethical
problem to be addressed by the pope.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, is on a
six-week tour of Europe, Africa and North America, in part to
persuade foreign governments to maintain the sanctions despite
recent reforms by South African President F.W. de Klerk.
   John Paul received Mandela in a 25-minute audience.
   As reporters were let into the pope's private library at the end
of the talks, John Paul told Mandela: ``Thanks be to God that we
can meet.'' Mandela was freed in February after more than 27 years
in prison.
   In the past, the pope has praised Mandela as a ``man who suffers
for the rights of his people.'' Last year the Vatican issued a
major document on racism that harshly condemned apartheid.
   Turning to reporters, Mandela said the ANC believes sanctions
need to be maintained and ``I asked them (the Holy See) to express
themselves very clearly on this issue.
   ``I asked our father (the pope) to bless this initiative because
we are sure his blessing would help because his stands on issues
like apartheid and anti-Semitism have been so clear they have won
respect from the whole world.''
   John Paul replied in English: ``God bless your initiatives.''
   In a statement, the Vatican said the audience granted to Mandela
was ``further confirmation of the Holy See's commitment in favor of
a peaceful political evolution in South Africa'' and the
``progressive overcoming of the system of apartheid.''
   It said such changes should lead to a society ``based on
pacification and reconciliation among all components of that
nation, with the guaranteeing and respect of the fundamental rights
of all citizens.''
   Earlier today, Mandela received honorary citizenship of Rome. He
thanked Italians for their support against ``one of the most brutal
forms of oppression the world has ever seen.'' Mandela also met
with President Francesco Cossiga and Senate President Giovanni
Spadolini.
   South Africa has 5 million whites, 28 million blacks, about 3
million people of mixed race, and 850,000 Asians and Indians.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs.
   Reforms recently implemented by de Klerk include freeing
Mandela, legalizing the ANC, and lifting most of a 4-year-old
national state of emergency.

<HEAD>Shamir Says U.S. Criticism Encourages Arab Aggression</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today blamed U.S.
criticism of Israel for stirring up growing Arab hostility toward
the Jewish state.
   ``Aggressive intentions ... begin to surface in the Arab world
as soon as they see cracks or breaches in the wall of friendship
between Israel and the United States,'' Shamir said in an interview
today in the Jerusalem Post.
   A top aide to Shamir, meanwhile, suggested Israel would not
accept an earlier U.S. compromise plan on peace talks.
   The comments by Shamir and his aide followed sharp remarks by
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, urging Israel's new
right-wing government to move to restart the stalled peace process.
   Baker, testifying before a Senate committee Wednesday,
sarcastically recited the telephone number of the White House
switchboard and said: ``When you're serious about this, call us.''
   Baker proposed in October that Israelis and Palestinians meet in
Cairo for preliminary peace talks. Palestinian delegates would
include people deported from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and others who have homes in both the territories and
Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
   The formula was intended as a compromise between Israel's
refusal to talk to the PLO and the stance by the PLO that
Palestinians outside the territories should be included in talks.
   A top Shamir aide, asked today whether the Baker plan was still
relevant, said: ``We are asking to start from the beginning ... to
get the process on a track that will not lead us to negotiations
with a delegation composed by the PLO, and that will lead us into
the danger of a Palestinian state.''
   ``It is unacceptable that they (the Americans) return exactly to
this point and propose the same questions to the new government
that has been formed,'' said Yossi Ben-Aharon, director of the
prime minister's office, speaking on Israel army radio.
   Baker said on Wednesday that ``there won't be any dialogue,
there won't be any peace'' if Israel's new government makes
unacceptable demands for Palestinian participation in peace talks.
   The Baker comments drew angry reaction today from some members
of the Shamir coalition.
   A senior legislator of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc complained
that the United States, which pays $3 billion in aid to Israel
every year, was acting like a colonial ruler.
   ``After all, we are not a colony. We are a sovereign state,''
Eliyahu Ben-Elissar, head of Parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, said on Israel radio today. ``We are not
obligated to give positive answers to everything the Americans ask
for, everything Baker proposes.''
   In the occupied territories, Israeli troops destroyed the homes
of four Palestinians and sealed a fifth today as punishment for
attacks on soldiers and Arabs accused of collaborating with Israel,
the army said.
   Since the suspects lived in typical Palestinian fashion within
extended families, the houses destroyed and sealed were home to 74
people.
   The demolitions raised to nine the number of houses destroyed
this week in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Three houses
were sealed.
   Israel's practice of destroying and sealing houses of
Palestinian suspects been criticized by the United States and human
rights groups as collective punishment.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories said at the end of May that 293 Palestinian homes had
been destroyed and 173 sealed since the start of the 30-month-old
uprising.

   A dozen people were hurt in the emergency
evacuation of a New York-bound TWA jet at Heathrow airport today
after a faulty cockpit indicator warned of a fire, authorities said.
   A TWA spokesman, Sam Nakamura, said a problem with an
air-conditioning unit had caused the fire-warning light to go on,
even though there was no fire.
   An airport spokesman said 10 people were treated at the scene
for minor injuries and two people were taken to hospitals after the
222 passengers and 14 crew members slid down chutes while
evacuating the plane.
   Nakamura said the Lockheed Tri-Star had taxied out and was
awaiting clearance for takeoff when there was an ``indication'' of
a door problem.
   The aircraft taxied off the runway, and then there was
indication of a fire, Nakamura said.

<HEAD>U.S., Iran Sign $600 Million Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran agreed today to pay the
American oil company Amoco $600 million for facilities seized
during the 1979 Islamic revolution, according to an official of the
claims panel.
   It was the first major settlement of more than $1.8 billion
worth of U.S. corporate oil claims filed against Iran at the
Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, arbitrating financial claims by
the two nations since 1981.
   Settlement of the oil claims would be a major step toward
resuming oil trading ties between Iran and the United States.
   The two nations severed ties after the Islamic revolution, led
by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the seizure of American
hostages, who were held by Iranian militants at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran for 444 days.
   The Hague-based tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers
Accord of 1980, which paved the way for the release of hostages.
   It has been the only official forum where American and Iranian
officials have been meeting throughout their nations' decade-long
confrontation.
   American and Iranian officials have stressed their talks deal
only with financial arbitration and do not consider the fate of the
six American hostages still being held in Lebanon. But another
smaller settlement was reached at the tribunal last month shortly
after two Ameican hostages were freed in Lebanon.
   The tribunal has three American, three Iranian and three
third-nation arbitrators, and has so far settled $3.2 billion worth
of government-to-government and private claims, including today's
settlement.
   Oil accounts for 90 percent of Iran's foreign exchange earnings,
and the absence of the American market has been a major financial
blow to a nation whose economy was ravaged by the eight-year
Persian Gulf war with Iraq.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been seeking to restore and
expand trade links with the West, but he has faced opposition from
Islamic militants who want no dealings with the United States.
   Today's settlement concerned claims by two Amoco subsidiaries
against the National Iranian Oil Co., according to the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with tribunal policy.
   The Amoco Iran Oil Co. filed the largest of the two claims,
worth $540 million, for the expropriation by Iran of four offshore
drilling fields in the gulf, known as Nowruz, Ardeshir, Cyrus and
Darius, the official said. The Darius field includes Kharg island,
the shipping point for most Iranian oil.
   The second claim, for $60 million, was filed by Amoco
International Finance Corp. and related to Iran's seizure of a
petrochemical plant on Kharg, the official said.
   The Amoco package as a whole ``was one of the most strongly
contested claims ... It removes a lot of work from the tribunal,''
the official told The Associated Press.
   Today's settlement leaves pending more than $1.2 billion worth
of claims from oil companies which did business in
pre-revolutionary Iran, according to the official.
   It followed last month's settlement of about 3,000 financial
claims totaling $105 million, known as the ``Small Claims'' package.
   The Small Claims package was signed shortly after the release of
American hostages Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian
kidnappers in Beirut.
   The biggest item still on the tribunal's agenda is an Iranian
claim of up to $11 billion for military equipment ordered by the
Shah's government but never delivered because of the U.S. embargo
imposed on the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The U.S. government contends that much of the material Iran is
claiming compensation for is not under its control, but belongs to
individual contractors who were never paid.
   Washington claims it has found buyers for some of the equipment
Iran did pay for, and has deposited the money in Iran's accounts
after the revolution.

<HEAD>Embargo on Natural Gas to Lithuania to be Partially Lifted
Saturday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with blockade to be lifted Saturday,
quotes from diplomat. No Pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Communist Party Politburo
confirmed today that the blockade of natural gas to Lithuania will
be partially lifted starting Saturday as a gesture of Kremlin good
will.
   Meanwhile, Lithuania's President Vytautas Landsbergis, marking
the 50th anniversary of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic
republic, said today a Kremlin offer of future sovereignty might be
looked upon favorably.
   Moscow ordered the cutoff of all oil, most natural gas and some
raw material shipments to Lithuania in April in an effort to
persuade the republic to rescind its independence declaration of
March 11.
   On Wednesday, the Kremlin gave the first sign it may be ready to
ease the blockade, perhaps because of mounting domestic opposition
to it. The sanctions have idled 26,000 Lithuanian workers.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov reportedly told Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on Wednesday that 15 percent of
the republic's natural gas supply would be restored. However, there
had been no sign of the gas actually arriving.
   At a news conference today, Politburo member Yuri Maslyukov said
natural gas supplies to a large fertilizer plant in Lithuania would
be turned back on, as promised in the talks between Mrs. Prunskiene
and Ryzhkov.
   ``At that meeting, as far as I know, there was a request from
Prunskiene to supply gas,'' Maslyukov said. ``Ryzhkov gave that
instruction, that is 3.5 million cubic meters of gas starting from
tomorrow to be supplied to that plant.''
   Maslyukov said it was a goodwill gesture from the Soviet Union
and a ``reiteration of the Soviet goverment's interest in speeding
negotiation.''
   A spokesman at the Jonova fertilizer plant, Mysyunas Tautvid,
said the company received a telegram confirming that natural gas
supplies would be restored Saturday.
   On Thursday, the Moscow city council discussed sending gasoline
to the Baltic republic to ensure it has enough fuel to keep up milk
supplies to Russia. The Postfactum news service said Thursday that
the council, which is dominated by radical reformers, is thinking
of sending gasoline in rail tank cars guarded by council members.
   Food is always in short supply in the Soviet Union, but with the
recent panic buying touched off by the new economic government
plan, Moscow officials are especially concerned about keeping their
sources of dairy products.
   The newly elected president of the Russian Federation, Boris
Yeltsin, already has promised to send supplies to Lithuania. The
presidents of several other republics reportedly told President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday that the embargo should be stopped.
   In Lithuania, the republic's Supreme Council legislature held a
special session to commemorate the Red Army's entrance into the
Baltic republic after a secret Soviet-German agreement placing the
area under Soviet control.
   Algimintas Cekuolis, an adviser to the Supreme Council, quoted
Landsbergis as saying that a suggestion by Gorbachev on Tuesday to
create a new union of ``sovereign states'' could be seen in a
``maybe positive'' light.
   But, he quoted Landsbergis as saying, ``We have to have
guarantees and clearly visible deeds.''
   ``The country that attacked us in 1940 and has committed many
acts of international injustice, including now keeping occupied
holdings, has to prove its good will with something more
substantial than just declarations,'' Cekuolis quoted Landsbergis
as saying.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940. All three Baltic republics want back the
sovereignty lost at that time.

<HEAD>Bush Vetoes Bill to Allow Political Activity of Federal Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today vetoed a bill to ease a
ban against political activity by government workers, saying the
measure would destroy the ``essential political neutrality'' of the
federal work force.
   Bush said the legislation to liberalize the 51-year-old Hatch
Act would ``inevitably lead to repoliticizing'' the government
bureaucracy.
   It was the 12th veto of Bush's presidency. Congress has yet to
override one. Just this week, the Senate sustained Bush's veto of
an Amtrak authorization bill by a two-vote margin.
   In vetoing the Hatch Act measure, Bush said that, ``after all
the debate, no real need to repeal the existing Hatch Act has been
demonstrated.''
   For more than half a century, ``the Hatch Act has successfully
insulated the federal service from the undue political influence
that would destroy its essential political neutrality,'' Bush said.
   The bill would substantially erase prohibitions that now
restrict the nation's 3 million federal civil service and postal
employees to little more than voting.
   It would allow them to hold office in a political party, to
attend political conventions as a delegate and, in some cases, to
solicit political contributions from co-workers _ practices now
prohibited.
   Sponsors said that the measure would extend the same fundamental
freedoms now enjoyed by the rest of the population to federal and
postal workers.
   But, Bush argued, ``We cannot afford, in the final decade of
this century, to embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of
public administration from the last century.''
   Bush said the restrictions did not go far enough.
   ``As one who has devoted much of his life to public service, I
take great pride in the integrity of our federal work force,'' said
the president, who began his career with the federal government as
a House member in the mid-1960s.
   Bush's veto had been expected.
   The House approved the measure 334-87 on Tuesday.
   The Senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 67-30.
That's enough for a veto override. But GOP Senate leaders have
expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of their
colleagues to change votes to sustain a veto.

<HEAD>Canada Trade Agreement Working Well, Congress Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A major U.S.-Canadian trade agreement has
worked well in its first 18 months although it is plagued by some
paperwork problems, businesses from both sides of the border told
Congress today.
   ``Implementation of the free-trade agreement has occurred as
smoothly as might be expected and ... the Customs services of both
countries performed remarkably under less than ideal
circumstances,'' Michael Hachee of the Customs Brokers Association
in Champlain, N.Y., testified before the House Small Business
Committee.
   Andrew Vanderwal of Toronto, vice president of Canadian
Importers Association Inc., said some paperwork requirements
``create substantial business costs that detract from the trade
liberalization'' of the agreement.
   Witnesses agreed that the problems center around requirements
that a product being shipped across the border be accompanied by a
``certificate of origin,'' which must be signed by the exporter.
   ``This is a very time-consuming and costly process, particularly
for firms that ship tens of thousands of different small parts and
other items,'' Vanderwal said.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., chairman of the committee, said he
has received complaints in addition to those about paperwork. Some
businesses have complained about a lack of practical information on
procedures, and others are concerned about administrative problems
encountered at the border, LaFalce said.
   John P. Simpson, deputy assistant secretary of the treasury,
said the administration is pleased with the first 18 months under
the agreement, which, by 1998, will result in the world's largest
free-trade zone.
   ``The structure of the agreement itself has not been shown to
need a major overhaul, and the particular problems we have
discovered are being resolved expeditiously with the full
cooperation of the Canadian government,'' Simpson said.

<HEAD>Politicians Won't Change Abortion Stance Despite Church Warning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several prominent Roman Catholic politicians
said they wouldn't change their position favoring abortion rights,
despite Cardinal John O'Connor's warning that they could be
excommunicated.
   ``I'm prepared to put my soul in the hands of God rather than
the cardinal,'' state Sen. Nicholas Spano said in a typical
response to O'Connor's warning.
   But New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has sparred with O'Connor
over the abortion issue for years, said the pronouncement worried
him, even though it appeared consistent with the cardinal`s
previous statements.
   ``I don't like to hear it. How could you? This is something
fundamental to our family,'' the governor said Thursday.
   Cuomo has said he personally opposes abortion, but believes the
decision is up to each individual.
   Cuomo and other New York politicians were reacting to O'Connor's
strongest and clearest statement yet on the fate of those who
advocate a woman's right to an abortion. It was delivered in an
article in Catholic New York, the weekly archdiocesan newspaper.
   At the same time, a Roman Catholic diocese in Grand Rapids,
Mich., is threatening to excommunicate a Democratic candidate for
state Senate because she supports abortion rights.
   A spokesman for the diocese, Michael Ghering, said church
officials are investigating Jo McLachlan's pro-choice stand and
could decide to excommunicate her.
   McLachlan said she won't change her position. She is active in
Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Evart, in northwestern lower
Michigan.
   ``The issue is a Catholic political position rather than the
teaching of the church,'' she said. ``As an American citizen I have
a right to dissent and I am a dissenting Catholic. I think the
church is wrong.''
   Some church experts said canon law does not uphold O'Connor's
position.
   ``He's wrong,'' said the Rev. Richard McBrien, chairman of the
theology department at the University of Notre Dame. ``On the
question of abortion, the only person clearly subjected to
excommunication would be the person who procures the abortion.''
   That would be the woman and perhaps her doctor, but not any
politicians, he said.
   ``Mario Cuomo is not performing abortions. Mario Cuomo is not
running an abortion clinic on the side,'' said McBrien. ``He
(O'Connor) doesn't really have a canonical leg to stand on.''
   The Rev. Robert Drinan, a former Massachusetts congressman,
agreed that O'Connor's statements were misguided.
   ``That goes against what the bishops have been saying,'' said
Drinan, a Georgetown University Law Center professor. ``I think
that won't be taken that seriously.''
   But the Rev. Joseph Penna, speaking for the Archdiocese of New
York, said that a person could be excommunicated even if they do
not directly take part in an abortion.
   ``It goes beyond who procures an abortion,'' said Penna, of St.
Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. If church officials determined that
an individual served as an accomplice to an abortion by ``giving
scandal to other people,'' that person could be excommunicated, he
said.
   ``And by giving scandal, I mean a person would look at someone
else and say, `If that person can do it, so can I,''' said Penna,
speaking of the leadership roles that politicians play in society.

   Former Georgia state Sen. Julian Bond, who
admitted fathering the child of a former girlfriend, has been
ordered to pay $2,000 a month in child support and $12,500 for the
mother's past expenses.
   Deborah Kaye Moore of Atlanta, a flight attendant, filed a
paternity suit in September claiming Bond, 50, was the father of
her daughter, now 22 months old.
   Bond, who reached a divorce settlement with his wife of 28 years
the day before the paternity suit was filed, initially denied the
child was his. On May 19, he admitted he was the father.
   A Fulton County Superior Court jury last Thursday awarded Ms.
Moore the child support.
   Ms. Moore's attorney, Lewis M. Groover Jr., said Bond has never
had any contact with the child. Bond, who did not return phone
calls seeking comment, was remarried in March and lives in
Washington.

<HEAD>Mass Grave Discovered Near Military Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of about 10 people,
including a child, were found in an unmarked grave near a military
base in remote northern Nicaragua, officials said.
   In a televised news report, two women said they recognized
clothing worn by their sons when they disappeared seven years ago.
The women said their sons, 17 and 18, were captured by Sandinista
soldiers seven years ago.
   There was no indication of the identities of the remaining
bodies.
   The grave is on Mocoron mountain, 200 yards from an army base
north of Wiwili and near Nicaragua's border with Honduras. Wiwili
is 175 miles north of Managua.
   Marta Patricia Baltodano, executive director of Nicaraguan Pro
Human Rights Association, said several peasants and Wiwili town
council members informed the association's offices on June 4 of the
grave's location.
   Human rights workers were taken to the site three days later,
she said.
   She said that perhaps because of Hurricane Joan, which lashed
Nicaragua in October 1988, ``there was a shifting of soil that
allowed these bodies to come up to the top.''
   In the television report, the mother of Danilo Sobalvarro
Zeledon, 18, said she recognized the trousers her son wore when he
was picked up by soldiers.
   ``I'm satisfied (he was found) because I had been looking for
him in various prisons throughout Nicaragua,'' she said. ``The last
thing I knew was that he was with the Contras ... Now I don't have
to keep looking. I entrust him to the Lord.''
   The mother of Domingo Flores Palacios, 17, shown at the grave
site standing next to a pile of skulls and bones, said: ``My son
was wearing these red pants and a red plaid shirt'' when he was
taken by the army.
   Neither woman was identified. They said their sons were captured
by the Sandinista People's Army on Oct. 22, 1983, in San Jose
Bocay, a small town in northern Nicaragua.
   Pants, shirts, underwear and nylon ropes were found at the site.
It was believed the ropes might have been used to tie the victims'
hands.
   Human rights official Violeta Guevara said the bones of a
7-year-old boy were found among the remains.
   Andres Altamirano, the Jinotega coroner, said there were the
remains of about 10 bodies in the grave. He said the remains were
about eight years old.
   Roundups of young men by both the Sandinista army and Contra
rebels were common during the 9-year-old war civil war that left
30,000 people dead.
   Rebels are now laying down their weapons under agreements signed
with the new government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
who took over from the leftist Sandinistas on April 25.

   Ron Jacko, the deserter who surrendered to the
Marine Corps after two decades in Canada, was discharged today, a
Marine spokesman said.
   Jacko was given an ``other than honorable'' discharge and $61.50
before being released outside the gates of the Marine base in
nearby Quantico, Va., said Lt. Col. Robert McLean. He also was
given physical and dental exams.
   Regulations required the Marines to provide the exams, plus
money equal to three-fourths of a one-way bus ticket to the town
from which he entered the service _ in this case, Cleveland.
   Jacko, 42, deserted the Marines after completing basic training
in 1969. He said he opposed the Vietnam war and feared he would be
sent there.
   He has spent the last 21 years in Toronto, where he married and
managed health food stores. He decided to turn himself in because
he wanted to be near his mother, who is in poor health in Cleveland.
   ``She just went through three operations in about the last six
months,'' he said in a Tuesday interview. ``I want to be able to be
there.''
   Jacko presented himself at Quantico on Wednesday.
   After determining there were no other outstanding charges, the
base commander, Lt. Gen. W.R. Etnyre, granted the discharge
request, the spokesman said.
   Jacko's attorney said a young Marine gave Jacko a ride to
National Airport. ``He knew who he was, too. Ron was sort of bowled
over,'' said attorney Tod Ensign of the New York-based Citizen
Soldier.
   That group had helped arrange Jacko's return and pre-surrender
publicity, including a trip to Capitol Hill to solicit the support
of Jacko's hometown congresswoman, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Ion Iliescu today
ordered miners he had summoned to help put down anti-government
riots to go home, but many remained in the capital, clubbing anyone
they considered a government opponent.
   Iliescu's swearing-in as president was postponed amid the chaos.
   The miners streamed into Bucharest on Thursday, after Iliescu
called for their help in countering what he called ``facist''
forces. The miners beat pedestrians and journalists and raided the
offices of opposition parties.
   The state news agency Rompres said Iliescu met with the miners'
leaders today and ordered them to leave the capital, and that
miners began boarding buses for Bucharest's northern railway
station.
   From there, they were to return on special trains to their homes
in the Jiu valley mining region of western Romania. But an hour
after the announcement, miners were still roaming central Bucharest.
   Iliescu was to have been sworn in today at a meeting of both
houses of Parliament. But a woman answering the phone at his
office, who refused to give her name, said the session was put off
until Monday. She would not elaborate.
   ``This is a death of democracy,'' said opposition leader Ion
Ratiu, whose home was ransacked by maurauding miners. ``(It's) the
rule of the mob, no respect for human rights. The forces of law and
order stand by instead of maintaining law and order.''
   Following the December pro-democracy revolution that ousted the
hard-line Communist government and set up elections that Iliescu
and his National Salvation Front won, Ratiu returned to Romania
after 50 years in exile. Despite the latest violence, he said he
would stay and fight for democracy.
   Premier Petre Roman told a news conference today that the miners
had been asked to occupy University Square in a peaceful way and
all subsequent violence was deplorable. On Wednesday, police broke
up a 53-day protest in the square by anti-Communist protesters who
distrust Iliescu's ties to the former regime.
   Government forces later fired on the protesters who attacked
government buildings, killing at least five people and injuring
more than 350.
   Then the miners arrived.
   Mirela Roznoveanu, a journalist with the Romania Libera
newspaper, said the miners beat a co-worker and destroyed the
editorial offices of the newspaper Thursday. The paper, which had
been the main voice of opposition against Iliescu and the
government, did not appear today.
   The violence by the miners Thursday was the latest outburst in
the capital's worst street fighting since the bloody December
revolution that ousted and executed Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Rompres quoted an unidentified spokesman for the miners as
saying nobody had invited them to come to Bucharest. But it was
clear they were being given at least logistical support, with
municipal buses and army trucks transporting them by the hundreds
to key points in the city.
   On Thursday, unidentified people in a van carrying loudspeakers
warned passers-by: ``don't incite the miners ... you would thus
give birth to fierce violence.'' The speakers also instructed the
miners to grab journalists and take them into the van. ``We will
take care of them,'' they said.
   Dozens of people were assaulted and clubbed by the helmeted
miners.
   About 10 miners besieged the residence of Iliescu critic Dumitru
Mazilu for several hours before dispersing, according to Mazilu and
a neighbor.
   Mazilu, the former vice president of the post-revolutionary
government, stepped down following charges that he collabrated with
the Securitate, the secret police force that killed hundreds during
the revolution.
   The miners were apparently directed by several men who Mazilu
said were ``Securitate or former Securitate'' agents.
   Rompres reported that Marian Munteanu, head of the anti-Iliescu
Students' Alliance, was hospitalized with unspecified injuries.
Miners near the square boasted they had beaten the student leader.
   The miners also occupied and ransacked opposition party
headquarters, including those of the 21st of December Organization
of students who fought against Ceausescu.
   Other government suporters ransacked the headquarters of the
opposition Liberal Party, as well as Bucharest University's Faculty
of Foreign Languages.

   Nine people were injured in a

reported Friday.
   The explosion, which occurred early in the morning in Mlada
Boleslav, 34 miles from Prague, destroyed the station and sent
bricks smashing through house windows up to 600 feet away, the CTK
agency said.
   The cause of the blast was not immediately clear. The news

time of the explosion.
   The Skoda car factory, located about one mile away, stopped
production after the blast, CTK said. Experts recommended the
factory stop production for security reasons, factory spokesman
Jiri Danhelka said. He did not elaborate.
   Danhelka said none of the injuries was serious.
   The station was part of a system that carries hot water to
nearby houses.

<TEXT>
   Detroit Pistons fans celebrating the team's
second consecutive NBA championship turned violent today, and at
least seven people died and several more were critically injured as
thousands packed downtown streets.
   Police in suburban River Rouge arrested 28 revelers, most on
disorderly conduct charges, and there were numerous reports of
looting and related violence. Detroit police had no overall count
of arrests or violent incidents.
   In the crush, a car plowed into pedestrians on the city's east
side about 1:15 a.m., killing four people and injuring one, Detroit
police Lt. Phil Foster said.
   A 9-year-old boy was pronounced dead at Children's Hospital, a
10-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl died at St. John's Hospital,
and a 21-year-old man died late this morning at Detroit Receiving
Hospital, police Sgt. Christopher Buck said.
   Buck said the driver of the car remained at large.
   A 19-year-old man was shot to death and a 25-year-old man
critically injured at a parking lot at 2:15 a.m., Foster said. He
said the lot was packed with revelers and someone shot into the
crowd.
   The streets _ some strewn with glass _ were quiet by dawn, and
police who stayed through the night on overtime headed home.
   A 4-year-old suburban Detroit child was struck and killed by a
car during a street celebration in River Rouge, said Lt. David
Israel of that suburb's police department.
   ``The child was excited and ran into the street,'' said Israel,
who withheld the name pending notification of relatives.
   A 21-year-old man fell from the roof of an apartment building
during a celebration party and died later at Detroit Receiving
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Diane Cooper.
   The 60-year-old owner of a party store was being held by police
today after allegedly shooting a 17-year-old man and a 21-year old
man who tried to break into the store, Foster said. The teen-ager
was shot in the head and listed in critical condition. The other
man was being treated for a gunshot wound.
   Robert Egan, a Mount Carmel Hospital nurse, said fights even
broke out in the hospital's emergency room early this morning.
   ``We were running around like crazy. We registered something
like 20 gunshot wounds between midnight and 4 a.m.,'' Egan said.
``It was ridiculous. In my three years here, I've never seen
anything like this.''
   Several partiers told television crews they were robbed as they
stood on the streets and others said people reached into their
cars, stealing stereo speakers and wallets, as they tried to drive
through the crowds.
   In Ecorse, next to River Rouge, police reported damage to some
businesses but made no arrests, Chief Francis DeCrease said.
   ``The crowd of about 600 people were partying and got out of
hand and busted a scout car window,'' DeCrease said. ``Some people
were shooting weapons in the air. They try to treat it like New
Year's Eve.''
   The violence was reminiscent of 1984 when the Detroit Tigers
baseball club won the World Series and more than 100,000 people
poured into the streets. Fans stripped, overturned and burned cars,
looted businesses and caused widespread damage. One person died.
   Traffic in downtown Detroit ground to a halt as merrymakers
weaved between the cars, hugging and chanting ``Bad boys!'' in the
hours after Vinnie Johnson's shot with seven-tenths of a second
left gave the Pistons a 92-90 win over the Trail Blazers in
Portland, Ore.
   ``This is better than last year. We're in history now. We're
part of a dynasty, we're up there with the Los Angeles Lakers and
the Boston Celtics, the only ones to repeat,'' said 28-year-old fan
Herb Hayden of Detroit.
   Detroit police officers were held over a shift to disperse the
jubilant throng. The revelers scattered by daylight.
   The traffic tangle was worsened because streets already were
closed for the Detroit Grand Prix that begins today, said police
spokeswoman Allene Ray. ``We're trying to reroute traffic, to keep
everybody moving,'' she said.
   Earlier, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons' suburban
Detroit home court, 21,400 devotees paid $3 each to watch the game
on a huge overhead television screen.
   ``I'm going to stay up all night, party in the parking lot, then
party anywhere I can because I know the whole city will be
celebrating,'' said Tom Stansell, 21, of Dearborn.
   Last year, hundreds of carloads of boisterous fans also jammed
streets after the Pistons' 105-97 win over the Los Angeles Lakers
for a 4-0 sweep of the National Basketball Association finals and
their first championship. But that celebration was devoid of the
damage and deaths that occurred today.
   Within minutes after Thursday's game, Mayor Coleman Young
scheduled a victory parade Monday in downtown Detroit.
   ``This team is something our city and Detroiters are very proud
of,'' he said.
   The Pistons were to fly back to Detroit this afternoon.

   The first contested elections since
independence from France in 1960 will be held July 8 for a new
national assembly, the government announced Friday.
   The announcement follows unprecedented democratic elections this
week in two other North African countries _ Tunisia and Algeria.
   The government said 436 candidates will run for 123 assembly
seats, and the campaign begins Sunday.
   The elections are part of constitutional reforms approved by 99
percent of the voters who cast ballots in a national referendum in
December that also gave President Hissene Habre another seven-year
term.
   One of the reforms took effect in April with the dissolution of
the National Consultative Council, a legislative body chosen solely
from the ruling National Union For Independence and the Revolution.
   Other parties are banned and cannot form to support candidates
in next month's elections.
   Although candidates may belong to the ruling party, all are
running as independents.
   The winners will serve five-year terms. Five seats are reserved
for women and one for the disputed Aouzou Strip claimed by Libya,
to the north.
   Chad, a landlocked nation of 5.5 million people, is one of the
world's poorest countries with a per capita annual income of about
$200. It has been engaged in civil war almost continuously since
independence.
   Habre's overnment currently is fighting rebels who stage
lightning raids on border outposts from neighboring Sudan. It
widely believed that the rebels receive aid from Libya, but Libya
denies this.

   Miners from across the Soviet Union
today passed a vote of no confidence in the Communist Party and
called for the party to relinquish its assets. They also agreed to
form an independent union.
   ``We are workers, but we do not consider the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union our party,'' said the resolution. ``We call for a
mass exit from the party.''
   The resolution demanded that the party relinquish its control
over large state enterprises and give up holdings including
property and bank accounts filled with members' dues.
   The resolution, approved by a vote of 308-116, said Communists
could no longer present themselves as champions of workers' rights.
   ``The Communist Party is losing its authority,'' said a
resolution passed by the first congress of Soviet miners meeting in
the Don Basin coal mining region of the eastern Ukraine.
   The resolution created a committee to set up the framework of a
miners' union free of government or Communist Party control. That
framework will be considered at a second miners' congress in Moscow
on Aug. 15-16.
   The push for an independent union opens another rift between
Soviets and their government.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has encouraged decentralization,
but formation of an independent miners' union would mean the
government would have less control over workers who are seen as the
backbone of the Communist system.
   Being outside the government structure would also make it easier
for the workers to organize strikes, another threat to the
faltering economy.
   Miners also gave a warm welcome to two American trade union
representatives, Richard Wilson of the AFL-CIO, and John J. Banovic
of the United Mine Workers of America.
   Both Americans promised that their unions would assist the new
independent Soviet miners' union.
   ``A free society requires independent trade unions, requires the
right of association free of government and party control,''
declared Wilson, who said he was the first AFL-CIO reprsentative to
be allowed into the Soviet Union.
   ``It requires that workers make their own decisions,'' he said.
   Earlier today, miners backed away from renewing last summer's
nationwide coal strike protesting poor mine conditions, housing,
food and consumer goods.
   On Thursday, the 712 delegates representing every coal mine in
the country passed a resolution calling for the resignation of
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and drove the Soviet mining
minister from their meeting with angry shouts and demands.
   Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov, the head of the State
Planning Commission, told a news conference in Moscow today that
the miners' declaration of no confidence in the government was ``a
very alarming and serious signal.''
   He said the government wanted miners to know that ``we are not
going to infringe on the interests of the population, including the
miners, but we want to set up a correct policy to get the country
out of the situation that it has found itself in.''
   The miners miners debated whether to try to take over the
existing union or base a new organization on workers' committees
formed during the nationwide coal strike that crippled heavy
industry last summer.
   ``We don't know whether a free union is really needed,'' said
Yuri Balderov, a member of the Donetsk workers' committee that
organized the congress.
   Some miners have said they feared that breaking ties with the
old union, which is under the mining ministry's control, would deny
them access to vacation resorts, pensions and other benefits to
which they have already made financial contributions.
   It appeared the miners would not vote to stage another strike,
although many delegates to the congress accused the government of
failing to fulfill the promises it made to end last July's walkout.
   Many miners said a strike could do more harm than good.
   A telegram the miners sent to national lawmakers criticized the
government. ``The government of the U.S.S.R. does not have our
trust,'' said the telegram, sent Wednesday to the national Supreme
Soviet legislature in Moscow.
   ``We urge workers in other industries to quickly cut their ties
with the government,'' said the telegram, read aloud Thursday at
the Supreme Soviet.
   The telegram also criticized an economic reform plan proposed
last month by Ryzhkov and defended on national television by
Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Small Intestine Transplant Called A Success</HEAD>

   Surgeons at a Pittsburgh hospital said they
have performed the nation's first successful transplant of a small
intestine.
   The patient, a man shot in the abdomen in October, was kept
alive on intravenous feedings until undergoing the transplant at
Presbyterian-University Hospital, said Dr. John Fung, assistant
professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh.
   ``He is eating but I can't venture to say what will happen in
the long term,'' Fung said. ``He's still in the hospital because he
is still recovering and we are doing more testing.''
   Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl and Fung mentioned the
surgery Wednesday in a meeting with the University of Pittsburgh's
board of trustees. The physicians declined to be interviewed
following the meeting, and hospital officials refused to disclose
any other details. Fung said the operation was done about two
months ago on the patient, who was not identified.
   Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said Thursday it was premature
to discuss the surgery. She said small intestine transplants
previously were attempted at the hospital only as part of three
multiple-organ transplant operations. All three patients died.
   Dr. Ronald Ferguson, chief of transplantation at Ohio State
University Hospital in Columbus, said the operation was
encouraging. He said very few small intestine transplants have been
attempted, and none of the patients survived.

<TEXT>
   A court on Friday convicted a researcher for a
government scientific agency of passing on information on nuclear
research to the East German secret service for two decades.
   Rolf Dobbertin, an East German national, was sentenced to 12
years in prison.
   At the start of his trial Wednesday, Dobbertin defended his
actions by saying East German intelligence officials had coerced
him into providing information.
   Dobbertin, 55, had testified that he was awarded a grant to
study abroad, but was not allowed to accept it unless the secret
service approved.
   ``In our country, nothing could be done without the
authorization of the security services,'' he said. ``Don't forget
this was during the Cold War. They wanted to be able to contact me
at any moment, and I had to learn how to code and decode messages.''
   Dobbertin was hired 30 years ago at France's National Center for
Scientific Research, and passed on information on nuclear research
and other topics to East Germany for about 20 years.
   The sentence imposed by the presiding judge was harsher than the
five-year term requested by the prosecutor.
   Judge Maurice Colomb asked if Dobbertin still considered himself
a Marxist, as he was in his youth.
   ``Marxism doesn't have a big future in the East,'' Dobbertin
replied, referring to the fall of the Communist government in East
Berlin in December.
   Dobbertin was unmasked in 1979 and held in custody for four
years during complex legal proceedings before being released on
bail in 1983. He had since resumed his post.
   His superiors at the research center defended him during the
trial, saying the documents he covertly transmitted to East Germany
contained information that was publicly available.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Auto Stockpiles Contribute To Jump In Industrial
Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production jumped 0.6 percent in
May, the Federal Reserve said Friday, but analysts said the sharp
gain was due mainly to a temporary buildup in automobile
inventories.
   ``I think it was somewhat of a fluke,'' said economist Paul
Getman of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
``Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production was up
0.2 percent. That is more in line with the underlying
fundamentals.''
   Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
economic forecasting firm, contended the inventory building in the
auto industry was due to concern over the expiration of the Big
Three auto makers' labor contracts in September.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New
York government securities dealer, noted that the auto makers
reported a drop in output in the first 10 days of June.
   ``So industrial production is showing only temporary strength
and will probably tilt in a weaker direction in coming months as
automakers in particular have to scale back production more in line
with demands,'' he said.
   Two government reports earlier this week pointed to slowing
consumer demand as the job market weakens and wages fall. Consumer
spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, has been a driving force for the economy for
much of the last eight years.
   Declining consumer spending, combined with tighter restrictions
on credit in many parts of the country, ``could threaten to push
the economy over the edge into a recession in the second half of
the year,'' Jones said.
   In addition to auto production, Evans said some of the increased
output was due to exports which analysts have credited for helping
sustain recent U.S. economic growth.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that exports helped
shrink the U.S. trade deficit so far this year to an annual rate of
$92.16 billion, compared to a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.99
billion.
   Industrial production has risen each month since January except
for April, when it was unchanged. But even the flat April figure
was an improvement over the 0.4 percent decline first reported last
month.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods rose 0.8 percent in May after
slipping 0.2 percent in April.
   Output of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at
least three years _ jumped 1.3 percent after a 0.2 percent decline
a month earlier. Manufacturing of non-durable goods such as food
and clothing was up 0.2 percent following a 0.4 percent gain in
April.
   Output at mines was unchanged in May after a 0.7 percent advance
the previous month. Utility production was down 1.1 percent
following a 0.7 percent increase in April.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in May stood at
109.7 percent of its 1987 base, up from 109.0 in April.
   The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities _ which usually move in tandem with
industrial production _ rose 0.3 percent to 83.6 percent in May.
The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in
productivity levels.
   The operating rate at factories producing durable goods rose 0.8
percent to 82.0 percent, while the rate at plants making
non-durable goods inched downward 0.1 percent to 84.3 percent.
   The operating rate at mines was unchanged at 88.9 percent, while
it dropped a full 1.0 percent to 84.9 percent at utilities.

   East German authorities today arrested a West
German couple wanted for masterminding a string of terrorist
attacks, including the 1985 bombing of a U.S. military base,
authorities said.
   The two were among seven terrorist suspects arrested Thursday
and today, officials said. One was freed because charges against
her had expired.
   In the past 10 days, the two German governments have made a
concerted effort to solve decade-old terrorist cases, sometimes
using intelligence information left behind by East Germany's ousted
Communist government.
   The terrorist suspects had apparently hidden in East Germany
with the help of Communist authorities.
   The East German interior ministry said Barbara and Horst Meyer,
probably West Germany's most wanted terror suspects, were nabbed
today at the main train station in the city of Leipzig after being
spotted by travelers.
   They are wanted in connection with attacks including a car
bombing that killed two people and wounded 20 others at the U.S.
Air Force's Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt in August 1985.
   Arrested today with the Meyers was Sabine Elke Callsen, 29, who
is wanted in a pair of 1985 bombing attacks, the Interior Ministry
said.
   A day earlier, four suspects _ two married couples with young
children _ were arrested in Frankfurt an der Oder and Cottbus,
according to Hans-George Fuchs, a spokesman for the West German
federal police office in Wiesbaden.
   At a news conference in East Berlin, Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel said one of those who was taken into custody
Thursday, Christine Duemlein, was freed because her West German
arrest warrant had expired.
   The six suspects remaining are believed to be members of the
notorious Red Army Faction, a radical leftist group that claimed
responsibility for a string of bombings and killings in the 1970s
and 1980s.
   The suspects arrested Thursday are Monika Helbing, 36, and
Ekkehard von Seckendorff-Gudent, 49, in Frankfurt an der Oder; and
Werner Lotze, 38, and Ms. Duemlein, 41, in Cottbus. Von
Seckendorff-Gudent is a physician and holds the title of baron.
   All had been living under assumed names, Diestel said.
   The arrests came just days after the capture of two other
prominent members of the Red Army Faction, whose members have been
among the most sought-after fugitives in West German history.
   Officials on Wednesday arrested Inge Viett, 46, who had been
living under an assumed name in the East German city of Magdeburg.
Susanne Albrecht, 39, was arrested June 6 outside her apartment in
East Berlin.
   She told police this week that the former Communist secret
police gave her a false identity and helped her settle in the
country. Diestel has accused the secret police of harboring Western
terrorists.
   Ms. Helbing, Lotze and Ms. Albrecht have been linked to the
kidnap-slaying in 1977 of West German industrialist Hanns-Martin
Schleyer and numerous other terrorist crimes.
   Ms. Albrecht and Lotze also have been linked to the 1977 slaying
of Juergen Ponto, the head of West Germany's second-biggest bank.
   West German authorities have accused Ms. Viett of taking part in
the murder of prominent West Berlin Judge Guenter von Drenkmann in
1974.
   Von Seckendorff-Gudent is accused of membership in a terrorist
organization, Fuchs said. That was also the charge in the
now-expired warrant against Ms. Duemlein.
   Von Seckendorff-Gudent was allegedly also a member of the
infamous Baader-Meinhof gang in West Germany, an early 1970s
forerunner of the Red Army Faction.
   Lotze and Ms. Helbing also are accused of robbing a bank of
$120,000 in the West German city of Nuernberg in April 1979.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the West German federal
prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, said a 1978 warrant issued for
Ms. Duemlein expired two years ago.
   Western officials have long contended that the former Communist
regime either endorsed, trained or condoned leftist terrorism.
   The former secret police known as the Stasi, one of the most
skilled and feared intelligence networks in the world, is believed
to have trained the secret services of several other countries, and
people linked to terrorism.

   Gen. George S. Patton's 2nd Armored
Division helped win the Battle of the Bulge, but now it has lost
the battle of the budget.
   The Army has decided to deactivate the unit, ending its colorful
history as the armored division with the longest active service
record. Formed in July 1940 for European service in World War II,
the division is being dismantled 50 years later in anticipation of
European peace.
   ``This division has the most glorious history of any combat unit
in the U.S. Army,'' Lt. Charles MacMaster at Fort Hood said
Thursday.
   Patton dubbed the division ``hell on wheels,'' promising it
would terrify enemies. Its troops adopted the nickname as their
motto. Today, its soldiers still proudly wear ``hell on wheels'' on
their division patch.
   Patton had urged armored units as early as World War I. It took
until just before the outbreak of World War II, though, for
military technology to advance enough to demand tank support units.
   For demanding the armored units, Patton was officially
reprimanded. But his persistence paid off. The 2nd Armored landed
on Omaha Beach, pushed through France, and was the first allied
unit to enter Belgium.
   After moving a record 100 miles in a single night, the 2nd
Armored helped win the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944
and was the first American unit to enter Berlin on July 4, 1945.
   The division had previously been badly defeated in 1943 when 25
of its tanks fought with the British in the Battle of Beja in
Tunisia, according to Capt. Jim Bolling. Only one tank survived
that battle, and troops nicknamed it the Gallant.
   Parts of the 2nd Armored also participated in the Korean and
Vietnam wars. One of its most famous soldiers was Elvis Presley,
who was honored in the 2nd Armored war museum at Fort Hood.
   Under pressure to cut spending in anticipation of a cutback in
European troop strength and more warming of superpower relations,
the Army announced Wednesday that it is deactivating the division.
   That means 3,537 military jobs will be cut by Sept. 30 at Fort
Hood. Another 8,615 in the division will be cut by the end of
fiscal year 1991.
   The division's goal _ supporting U.S. troops in Europe _ is less
important because ``as the Warsaw Pact disintegrates, the threat is
lessened,'' said Army spokesman Maj. Joe Padilla.
   During peacetime, Army divisions are periodically deactivated.
The United States had a record 84 divisions in service after World
War II, but now has only 18 active divisions, an Army spokesman
said.
   The 2nd Armored came to central Texas in 1946 when Fort Hood was
named Camp Hood.
   Angry at the prospective loss of military personnel, central
Texas residents near Fort Hood filed a lawsuit in state court to
try to stop the action. The court has not ruled.
   ``It has to hurt. I am sure it will,'' said Charles J. Gillen of
Lampasas, owner of Gillen's Army Surplus.
   ``It might take a little time to notice it but residents will,''
Gillen said. ``That includes surplus dealers, although it will help
them at first when they will have to sell more. There will be an
oversupply of surplus. The government is good about overbuying.''

<HEAD>Bureaucrat Defeats Yeltsin Ally to Become Russian Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bureaucrat was elected prime minister of the
Russian republic today, defeating a reformist ally of the
federation's president, Boris Yeltsin, the Tass news agency
reported today.
   The new prime minister is Ivan Silayev, who has been a deputy
prime minister in the Cabinet of Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov.
   The victory of a man with ties to the government of Yeltsin's
rival, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, may make it more
difficult for Yeltsin to pursue changes that go beyond Gorbachev's
reform program.
   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament led by Yeltsin took its first
step on a path of more radical reform by approving a resolution
that declared that the republic's laws take precedence over Soviet
ones.
   Silayev won 70 percent of the vote in the Russian Supreme Soviet
legislature to defeat Mikhail Bocharov, a leader in the Democratic
Russia bloc along with Yeltsin and a factory manager who has led
experiments with leasing his company from the state, Tass said.
   Silayev, 60, is a mechanical engineer by training who started
his career at the Gorky aircraft factory, Tass said.
   He moved up to minister of the aircraft industry, and then
became minister of the machine tool and instrument-making industry.
He became a deputy prime minister of the Soviet Union in 1985 and
now heads a bureau that coordinates the actions of four
machine-tool ministries.
   Yeltsin's reform drive is important to Gorbachev's because the
federation contains more than three-quarters of the nation's land,
including Moscow, and about 80 percent of the Soviet Union's people
are Russian.

   An American who has spent half his life in
Canada after deserting to avoid Vietnam was discharged from the
Marine Corps Friday, 21 years after he left.
   Ron Jacko, 42, was given physical and dental exams, $61.50 and
an ``other than honorable'' discharge before being released outside
the gates of the Marine base at Quantico, Va., said Lt. Col. Robert
McLean.
   Jacko had surrendered at the base south of Washington on
Wednesday, after telling his story to reporters and his hometown
congresswoman, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
   After determining there were no other outstanding charges, the
base commander, Lt. Gen. W.R. Etnyre, granted the discharge request
and Jacko was sent on his way ``in a matter of hours,'' said
spokesman McLean.
   ``We want to move as expeditiously as we can in these cases,''
he said.
   Regulations required the Marines to provide the examinations,
plus money equal to three-fourths of a one-way bus ticket to the
town from which he entered the service _ in this case, Cleveland.
   ``It's quite frankly no concern of ours where he goes,'' McLean
said.
   Jacko's attorney said a young Marine gave Jacko a ride to
National Airport outside Washington.
   ``He knew who he was, too. Ron was sort of bowled over,'' said
Tod Ensign of the New York-based Citizen Soldier, which arranged
Jacko's return and pre-surrender publicity.
   Jacko said in an interview Tuesday he had spent the past two
decades in Toronto, where he managed health food stores. He said he
decided to turn himself in because he wanted to be near his mother,
who is in poor health in Cleveland.
   Ensign said Jacko was on his way to New York and then Toronto,
where his wife was waiting. He didn't know when they planned to go
to Cleveland.
   Jacko said he was eager to see how his hometown had changed but
hadn't decided whether he would settle down in northeastern Ohio or
nearby Pennsylvania.
   He said he opposed the Vietnam war from the outset, but decided
to enlist in hopes of pulling an assignment that didn't directly
involve Vietnam.
   Assignment to communications school persuaded him he was likely
to be shipped to Vietnam. He fled to Canada while on leave after
basic training in 1969.

   Tamil rebels fired mortars at a vital
airfield in the Jaffna Peninsula on Friday, minutes after a
government minister departed following a new round of peace talks,
military officials said.
   At least 275 people, including 137 unarmed policemen massacred
by the rebels, have been killed since Monday when Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam gunmen started overruning police stations and
military camps along the east coast and the north.
   The death toll was compiled from reports by witnesses, rebels
and military sources. The government has not given an overall toll.
   The government said its troops switched from defensive to
offensive tactics Friday and killed 50 Tigers. A Tiger spokesman
acknowledged 50 rebel deaths in the past 48 hours.
   Justice Minister Shahul Hameed talked with Tamil Tiger leaders
for four hours Friday at the rebel stronghold in Jaffna city,
military officials said on condition of anonymity.
   The government did not say what was discussed at the meeting but
said Hameed would return to Jaffna on Saturday following
consultations with President Ranaisnghe Premadasa.
   After the talks, Hameed left for Colombo, the capital, from the
Palali airbase. Minutes after his military plane took off, rebels
fired mortars and machine guns at the airfield, the officials said.
   They said the attack was primarily a gesture of defiance as the
shells and bullets fell short of the airfield, 12 miles from Jaffna.
   The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland
for the Tamil minority, who say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese majority that controls the government. Tamils
comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18 million people, while
Sinhalese account for 75 percent.
   As Hameed made a fresh bid for a political solution, fighting
raged in the northeast between government troops and the Tigers.
Both sides claimed successes.
   A rebel spokesman contacted by telephone in Jaffna, 185 miles
northeast of Colombo, claimed the Tigers were holding on to about
20 police stations captured since they launched their offensive.
   The spokesman, who uses the codename Jayapala, claimed the
Tigers were still attacking in an effort to dislodge troops from
all army camps in the north and east.
   Military officials claimed their troops, aided by air cover,
were on the offensive Friday and had retaken at least three police
stations: Muttur, Pottuvil and Vavuniya, among the largest in the
north and east.
   In Parliament, opposition legislators charged the government had
been ``taken for a ride'' by the Tigers.
   They accused the government of abdicating its rule to the rebels
for more than a year.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the Tamil-dominated north and
east after India withdrew its peacekeeping forces in March
following an unsuccessful 32-month mission to disarm the rebels.
   More than 11,000 people have died in the 7-year-old Tamil
insurrection.
   The latest round of fighting began after a Tamil man told the
Tigers he was assaulted by a Sinhalese policeman on Sunday at a
police station in the east.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Catches a Cold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has been
contending with weighty problems like secessionist republics,
warring ethnic groups and a crumbling economy. On Friday, he coped
with a more common ailment: a cold.
   Gorbachev worked at home and stayed in touch by telephone, said
Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Lukyanov joked that some dreary weather during Gorbachev's trip
to the United States 12 days for a superpower summit ago might be
to blame for his ``little cold.''
   Moscow also has been chilly and rainy for more than a week.
   ``It seems your American climate and ours coincided,'' Lukyanov
told reporters.
   Lukyanov did not specify what Gorbachev was working on at home,
but the Russian Communist Party Congress is next week and Gorbachev
is expected to give an address.
   There was no indication that Gorbachev's ailment was anything
more than just what Soviet officials said it was.
   Back in the pre-glasnost days, when aging Soviet leaders were
out of sight for months suffering from serious illnesses, official
statements would sometimes say they had a cold.
   At 59, Gorbachev is the youngest and most vigorous Soviet leader
in years.
   Gregor Gysi, chairman of East Germany's Party of Democratic
Socialism, had been scheduled to meet with Gorbachev on Friday. He
told a Moscow news conference that the two had talked by telephone
instead.
   ``I have just talked on the phone and I wished a speedy recovery
to my colleague and I wished him to go back to his work as soon as
possible,'' Gysi said. ``He caught a cold but I know that he is
feeling better.''
   Although the official English translator described the illness
as a cold, East Germany's news agency ADN _ apparently based on
Gysi's original comment in German _ quoted him as saying it was an
``infection.''
   Gysi met Thursday with Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the
ruling Politburo, instead of with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev appeared healthy Tuesday, a long and grueling day for
him.
   He gave a major speech to the legislature in the morning. In the
afternoon, he met with the presidents of the 15 republics and
offered a plan to transform the country into a looser union of
``sovereign states.'' In the evening, he offered separate
compromise deals to leaders of the independence-minded Baltic
states.
   The next day, he wasn't feeling too well.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was quoted as
saying Gorbachev had begged off attending her meeting in the
Kremlin with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov on Wednesday. He
said then he wasn't feeling well.

<HEAD>Kassebaum Calls For Halt Of Exports To Iraq</HEAD>

   A farm state senator called Friday for an end
to U.S. exports to Iraq because of alleged human rights violations
that include torturing and killing children, even though U.S.
farmers might be hurt.
   ``There comes a time when I think some type of sanctions are
necessary to send a message,'' Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said
during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Iraq.
   ``It would hurt wheat sales in Kansas, that's true. But
sometimes we have to stand up and be counted,'' said Kassebaum,
whose state is the largest U.S. wheat producer.
   She made the statement to John Kelly, assistant secretary of
state for the Near East and South Asia. Iraq buys significant
amounts of U.S. wheat. Under a credit guarantee program, Iraq
purchased more than 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat in 1989
valued at $170 million.
   It also buys rice, timber, cattle, and commercial goods under
credit programs totaling more than $1 billion annually.
   The Bush administration is being increasingly pressured by
Congress to take action against the government of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein because of a human rights record the State
Department describes as ``abysmal'' and because of Iraq's efforts
to develop nuclear and chemical weapons systems.
   On Wednesday, a House Appropriations subcommitolice left behind an
army of agents and a Pandora's box of 6 million files that can ruin
lives, expose collaborators or be a valuable source of information

   President Bush vetoed a bill easing
51-year-old curbs on off-duty political activity by government
workers Friday, saying the measure could lead to ``political
exploitation and abuse.''
   Casting the 12th veto of his presidency two days after the
Senate upheld the 11th, Bush said there was no compelling reason to
modify the Hatch Act.
   ``The Hatch Act has upheld the integrity of the civil service by
assuring that federal employees are hired and promoted based upon
their qualifications and not their political loyalties,'' he said
in a veto message to Congress.
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, representing federal employes in 16 agencies and
departments, called the veto ``wrongheaded'' and urged the Senate
to override it.
   Although the measure passed both chambers by more than the
two-thirds majorities needed to sustain a veto, Republican leaders
have said they expect to be able to switch enough votes in the
Senate to sustain the veto.
   Bush has yet to have a veto overridden. Just Wednesday, the
Senate by a two-vote margin upheld his veto of a $2 billion Amtrak
authorization bill.
   The Hatch Act revision would affect 3 million federal employees
and postal workers, who are now prohibited from participating in
any form of political activity beyond voting.
   Sent to Bush by a 334-87 House vote on Wednesday, the bill would
allow government employees to work in political campaigns on their
own time, hold office in a political party and attend political
conventions.
   However, the measure would leave intact prohibitions against
running for partisan political office and soliciting money from the
public.
   Sponsors said the measure would extend some of the same
fundamental freedoms now enjoyed by most Americans to federal and
postal workers.
   But Bush said he was opposed to any tinkering with the Hatch
Act, passed in 1939 to prevent Depression-era government workers
from being pressured to work for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
re-election effort.
   Bush said the easing would ``inevitably lead to repoliticizing''
the government bureaucracy.
   ``It has been manifestly successful over the years in shielding
civil servants and the programs they administer from political
exploitation and abuse,'' Bush wrote.
   ``We cannot afford, in the final decade of this century, to
embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of public
administration from the last century,'' he said.
   Tobias, the federal union official, urged lawmakers to ``hold
fast to their commitment to federal workers.''
   He said in a statement, ``Senators must maintain their
courageous support of reform and not trade their collective
conscience for White House cufflinks or breakfast with Bush.''
   The Senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 67-30.
That would be just enough for a veto override. But GOP Senate
leaders have expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of
their colleagues to change votes.
   In sending the bill back to Congress with a veto, Bush told
lawmakers: ``As one who has devoted much of his life to public
service, I take great pride in the integrity of our federal work
force.''

   Thunderstorms swept through central and
eastern Ohio, causing flooding that killed at least ten people,
left dozens missing and forced hundreds of others from their homes,
officials said today.
   Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 people
overflowed when about 4 inches of rain fell Thursday night in about
an hour.
   ``It created a wall of water,'' said Jim Williams of the Ohio
Emergency Management Agency. ``The problem we're having right now
is accounting for the people we can't find.''
   Williams said 40 to 60 people remained unaccounted for at midday.
   Belmont County's sheriff's Sgt. Bart Giesey said 10 people were
confirmed dead.
   Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed
the area.
   The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed
away a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian Mountain
foothill town.
   Temporary morgues were set up at Bellaire City Hospital and a
funeral home in Shadyside. Four bodies were brought to the hospital
from the Shadyside area, hospital spokesman Lawrence England said.
   England said the four bodies were taken to the Bauknecht Funeral
Home in Shadyside. Patty Valloric, director of the funeral home,
said seven bodies had been brought there.
   The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at the
Jefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.
   Command center spokeswoman Karen Bovek said officials had no
complete death toll figure. Authorities were searching for victims
in rural areas.
   ``You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven't
been gotten to yet,'' she said. ``It's a disaster here.''
   Shadyside _ about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va. _ is in
Belmont County, a mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio.
   Acting Mayor James Amato said the storms created a deluge that
knocked homes off their foundations.
   ``There are a lot of trailers out in this area that got hit,''
he said.
   Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips
said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water
caved in the back wall. Two people were accounted for, she said.
But she could offer no estimate of how many were in the bar.
   Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from
three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into
the Ohio River.
   ``I don't know how to describe it ... you've got to see it to
believe it,'' Badia said.
   There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont,
and Licking County in central Ohio.
   The Ohio departments of transportation and natural resources,
the State Highway Patrol, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
and the American Red Cross are assisting state government in
assessing the damage, Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman
Stacie Gilg said.
   About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in central
Ohio after 3 inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets and
washing out rural roads.
   Residents from Newark and Marne in Licking County spent Thursday
night in three emergency shelters, said Licking County Disaster
Services Agency spokesman Neil Snelling. Sixty residents were from
one street in Newark.
   ``Nobody has been hurt, but everything is pretty wet here,''
Snelling said.
   The Newark Fire Department and other agencies evacuated
residents in low-lying areas of Newark and the neighboring village
of Marne, said Wayne Tresemer, Licking County Disaster Services
director.
   He said water was standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets on
the city's east side, and the Newark Fire Department and other
agencies used boats to evacuated some residents.
   Licking County was already among 14 Ohio counties covered in a
disaster declaration issued by President Bush for storms earlier
this month, and people who suffered losses from Thursday night's
storms will also be eligible for assistance, Ms. Gilg said.
   In Jefferson County, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena,
where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creek
flooding.
   Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County in central
Ohio and 3.75 inches of rain was dumped on Holmes County in
north-central Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night, the
weather service and local authorities said. The forecast for today
called for a slight chance of thunderstorms in central and southern
Ohio.

<HEAD>Iranian Government Bans Only Remaining Opposition Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian government has banned the
country's only remaining legal opposition party after arresting
eight of its members, an exiled Iranian group said Friday.
   The reported actions against the Freedom Movement, led by former
Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, signaled the final crushing of any
organized domestic opposition to the cleric-led government.
   A ruling by the revolutionary prosecutor in Tehran declared the
group illegal, according to Ali Safavi, spokesman in Baghdad for
the Mujahedeen Khalq or People's Holy Warriors, an Iranian
opposition group based in Iraq.
   There was no immediate confirmation from Iran's official news
agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   Iranian state television reported Thursday night that eight of
Bazargan's associates had been arrested. The report said those
arrested held secret foreign contacts and acted against Iran's
interests during the eight-year Gulf war against Iraq that ended in
August 1988. It gave no other details.
   Among those detained was Bazargan's son, whose name was not
given, and Ezzatollah Sahabi, a former planning minister under
Bazargan, the Mujahedeen said. Bazargan apparently has not been
arrested.
   Bazargan, a French-educated engineer who was jailed by Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was selected prime minister by Iranian
spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 23, 1979, a
few days after the revolution.
   But his moderate policies seeking gradual social and economic
reforms caused him to fall in disfavor with the fundamentalists.
Accused by his opponents of being pro-American, he resigned two
days after militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November
1979.
   Since then, Bazargan's small Freedom Movement has been allowed
to function as a token opposition party with some freedom to
criticize Iranian authorities. The Freedom Movement demanded that
Khomeini end the bloody war with Iraq.
   All other opposition groups were brutally suppressed, mainly
during the early post-revolutionary years when the Tudeh, or
Communist Party, and other leftist groups were crushed.
   Bazargan's main political action has been to circulate periodic
letters critical of government policies.
   About a month ago, Bazargan and about 90 others signed an ``open
letter'' to President Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for restoration of
constitutional rights.
   The letter condemned the government for trampling on civil
liberties and accused it of economic mismanagement and isolating
Iran internationally.
   The letter said ``the country is on the verge of an abyss,'' and
that ``none of the principles of freedom, justice and independence
have been fulfilled.''
   ``What you have produced for the poor are slogans and empty
stomachs,'' said the letter, which condemned the government for
unemployment, rising prices and the squandering of billions of
dollars in oil income.
   After the letter was made public, Khomeini's successor as
spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, criticized the Bazargan group.

   It was built against the odds in 1940
and saved from destruction 25 years ago. Now a lovingly preserved
Frank Lloyd Wright house faces a new threat: shifting ground is
tearing it apart.
   And it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to save the
house, which was built for $7,000.
   In 1963, the spare little house in then-rural Falls Church lay
in the path of progress: Interstate 66. The home's owner and the
National Trust for Historic Preservation teamed up to move the
house, board by board, to a similarly wooded site several miles
away, on the grounds of the Trust's Woodlawn Plantation.
   That act of salvage could lead to the home's eventual
deterioration.
   The Pope-Leighey house, built in 1940 and named for its first
and second owners, was rebuilt in 1964 on a seam of highly unstable
clay. To make matters worse, fill dirt was used atop the clay seam.
   ``It's fair to say when the house was moved and reconstructed,
we didn't know as much ... as we do today,'' Pope-Leighey director
Linda Cunningham Goldstein said.
   Cracks more than an inch wide snake through the concrete floors.
Smaller cracks are visible in the walls of one bedroom.
   The National Trust has considered numerous ideas for saving the
house a second time. Engineers and Trust officials have largely
ruled out another move.
   ``Every time you rebuild something, you lose something,'' Ms.
Goldstein said. ``We have to think very carefully about it if we
were to (construct) it a third time.''
   Instead, engineers likely will try to stabilize the foundation,
perhaps using steel rods or plates. Ms. Goldstein said she expects
a decision within a few weeks.
   The project could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but
there is no reliable estmate yet, Ms. Goldstein said. A fund-aising
arm of the non-profit Trust will make a public appeal for the
house, Ms. Goldstein said.
   The brick, cypress and glass house was built for Loren B. Pope,
a young Washington newspaperman who told Wright he made $50 a week.
   ``There are certain things a man wants during life, and, of
life. Material things and things of the spirit. The writer has one
fervent wish that includes both. It is for a house created by
you,'' Pope wrote in August 1939.
   Two weeks later, Wright replied: ``Of course I am ready to give
you a house.''
   Wright, credited with remaking 20th century American
architecture, was already famous and highly controversial when Pope
made his appeal. Pope's infatuation with the modern architect was
not shared by Washington banks, which refused to lend Pope money to
build the house.
   In the end, the Washington Star, where Pope worked as an editor,
lent him the money to build the house. He lived there six years.
   Pope, who is now 80 and runs a research service for prospective
college students, is aiding fund-raising efforts by appearing in a
documentary filmed at the house this spring.
   ``The Wright house is a very central part of my life. It was a
real adventure for a guy making just $50 a week and no safety nets
at all,'' Pope said in a telephone interview from his Washington
office.
   ``It was like living in a work of art,'' he said.
   The 1,250-square-foot, single-story home features Wright's
trademark flat, cantilevered roofs and simple exterior. A
cantilever over the driveway forms what was believed to be the
world's first carport.
   ``Of course it's worth saving. It's a prime example of Wright's
`usonian' ideas. It's really a unique thing,'' University of
Virginia architecture professor and Wright scholar Richard G.
Wilson said.
   ``Usonian'' was Wright's term for a philosophy of affordable
family housing entirely different from traditional, rectangular
styles.
   It is the only usonian home open to the public on the East
Coast, Ms. Goldstein said.
   ``It is very small on square footage, but very big on ideas,''
she said. ``There are no little separate spaces for doing this or
that. There is instead the one, central living area. Wright really
envisioned the family as a family, living in very close proximity.''

<HEAD>Iran, U.S. Settle $600 Million Oil-Company Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran removed one of the biggest
obstacles to renewed trade with the United States on Friday by
agreeing to pay a U.S. oil company $600 million for facilities
seized during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Two claims totaling $600 million were awarded to the American
oil giant Amoco, said an official of the Iran-United States Claims
Tribunal. It was the biggest settlement in the arbitration body's
nine-year history.
   The Tehran government has hinted recently that the resolution of
financial disputes with the United States might contribute to the
release of the six American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite
extremists in Lebanon.
   Last month, settlement of a much smaller claims package was
announced shortly after the release of American hostages Robert
Polhill and Frank Reed.
   American and Iranian officials at the tribunal have vigorously
denied conducting any direct talks on the hostage issue. They said
the tribunal deals only with arbitration of financial disputes.
   The Amoco settlement was among more than $1.8 billion in oil
company claims stemming from Iran's Islamic revolution led by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   U.S.-Iranian ties were severed over the holding of hostages at
the United States Embassy in Tehran for 444 days by Iranian
militants.
   The tribunal official, in a telephone interview, repeated ``our
strong position'' that the arbitration is not tied to the fate of
the American hostages in Lebanon.
   At issue in Friday's settlement were two claims filed by Amoco
subsidiaries against the National Iranian Oil Company, according to
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with
tribunal policy.
   The Amoco Iran Oil Co. is receiving $540 million worth of
compensation for the seizure of four Persian Gulf drilling fields
and the oil terminal on Kharg island, which is Iran's most
important oil terminal.
   The Amoco International Finance Corp. is to receive $60 million
for the expropriation of a petrochemical processing plant on Kharg,
the official said.
   Iran derives 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings from
oil exports, and President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been making
efforts recently to improve and expand trade with the West.
   However, he has faced strong opposition from Islamic militants
who want nothing to do with the United States.
   Until Friday, a $116 million award made in 1986 to the Sedco
firm had been the biggest single settlement by the tribunal since
its 1981 inception, according to the official. The firm built
drilling platforms in Iran before the revolution.
   The tribunal was set up as part of the 1980 Algiers Accord,
which helped win the freedom of the embassy hostages.
   The panel has three American judges, three Iranians and three
third-nation members. So far it has settled $3.2 billion worth of
government-to-government and private claims.
   Approximately 150 such claims are still pending, according to
the tribunal official, who could not specify their total worth.
   The biggest item still on the tribunal's agenda is an $11
billion claim filed by Iran for military equipment ordered before
the revolution and not delivered under the subsequent U.S. embargo.
   The U.S. government contends that much of the weaponry at issue
is not under its control but belongs to private contractors whose
bills were never paid by Tehran.
   Washington claims that the some of the hardware Iran did pay for
was sold to private buyers and the proceeds deposited in Iran's
bank accounts.
   Among those items were four warships taken over by the U.S.
Navy, the U.S. government has said.

   Jay Gorney, who wrote the music for the
Depression-era classic ``Brother Can You Spare a Dime?,'' has died
at age 93.
   Gorney died of Parkinson's disease Thursday at the Jewish Home
and Hospital for the Aged, said his wife, Sondra.
   ``Brother Can You Spare a Dime?,'' which has lyrics by E.Y.
Harburg, was introduced in the 1932 Broadway revue ``Americana.''
Gorney's other Broadway hits included ``Sweetheart Time'' and
``Merry Go Round.''
   A native of Russia, Gorney was 6 years old when he moved to the
United States with his family. He began writing songs
professionally in the 1920's for Broadway revues.
   Gorney went to Hollywood in 1933 and wrote for the movies.
Shirley Temple and James Dunn performed his song ``Baby, Take a
Bow'' in the 1934 move ``Stand Up and Cheer.''
   His songs were performed in several other movies including,
``Jimmy and Sally,'' ``Moonlight and Pretzels,'' ``Wild Gold,''
``Lottery Lover,'' ``Redheads on Parade,'' ``The Heat's On,'' and
``Hey Rookie.''
   In addition to his wife, Gorney is survived by a daughter and
two sons.

<TEXT>
   More than 160 of the nation's most feared
street thugs were arrested in a two-day nationwide gang roundup
targeting members of the violent Crips and Bloods, federal
officials said today.
   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, said 11 states were involved in operation
Street Sweep and more arrests and drug and weapons seizures were
expected through the weekend.
   ``What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a
national one,'' he said. ``This is a significant step to our
commitment attacking drugs.''
   Arrests were made in California, Louisiana, Arizona, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington and four other states which were not
immediately identified.
   ``Gang members are involved in murders, drive-by shootings,
narcotics trafficking, assaults, credit car fraud, robberies and
money laundering,'' Higgins said.
   During a morning news conference, authorities displayed a sample
of confiscated weapons.
   The bureau's national investigation revealed the Crips and
Bloods are heavily involved in crack distribution and firearms
trafficking, he said.
   The largest narcotics seizure was nearly 13 pounds of cocaine
worth $250,000 in Shreveport, La.
   The operation began Thursday and continued today. The majority
of arrests were in Southern California, where 134 people were taken
into custody.
   The Los Angeles part of the roundup was done with the Los
Angeles Police Department's Operation Hammer, extensive anti-gang
sweeps that have been undertaken since February 1988.
   ``Operation Hammer is intended to put as much pressure as
possible on gang members who are pushing drugs and carrying guns,''
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said today.
   Asked if federal law enforcement felt they would achieve victory
in the war on drugs, Higgins said: ``I'm convinced it's a winnable
war. We're in it for the long term.''

<HEAD>GOP Sponsor, Democrats Urge Bush Not to Veto Family Leave Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats pressed President Bush on Friday to
sign a bill guaranteeing workers emergency family leave, quoting
1988 candidate George Bush to support their arguments against his
threatened veto.
   The Republican sponsor of the bill also urged Bush to sign it,
saying a veto on such a ``bedrock family issue'' could backfire for
the GOP.
   The family leave bill went to the White House after the Senate
approved it Thursday evening on a voice vote.
   Bush did not respond to a question about it during a photo
session Friday. But press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``Yes''
when asked if Bush would veto the bill.
   White House officials have said Bush does support ``flexible
family leave policies'' by all employers but believes they should
not be mandated by government.
   The bill's main Republican sponsor, Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J.,
urged Bush not to act until she and other backers could meet with
him. She said a veto would leave the Republican Party open to
charges it is insensitive to working families.
   ``The point that has to be considered here is, do we want to be
perceived as the party that fights for a reduction in the capital
gains tax while we turn our backs on taxpaying, hard-working
American families who are in medical crisis,'' she said.
   The bill passed comfortably in the House last month, although
the margin fell 46 votes short of the two-thirds majority that
would be needed to override a veto.
   Senate passage came without a recorded vote. Sponsor Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said he was ``within two or three votes'' of a
two-thirds majority.
   Bush has vetoed 12 bills so far and hasn't been overridden on
any.
   The new legislation would require business and government
employers to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical
leave or with leave so they could care for a newly born or adopted
child or an ill child, parent or spouse.
   Employers would have to continue health coverage and then
restore a returning employee to his or her previous job or an
equivalent position.
   Seemingly confident the bill has broad public support, Democrats
taunted Bush with his own campaign rhetoric.
   At a news conference Friday, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell read from a campaign speech Bush made to a Republican
women's group in Illinois in fall 1988, while Bush was running for
president.
   He quoted Bush: ``We also need to assure that women don't have
to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or
caring for a child during a serious illness. This is what I meant
when I talked about a gentler nation.''
   ``Those are Mr. Bush's words before he became president,''
Mitchell said. ``Now it's up to the president to live up to his
words.''
   Democrats saw the issue as raising family values in a way that
favors them politically, at a time when many are under attack for
opposing Bush's constitutional amendment against flag burning.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., described Bush as ``wrapping
himself in the flag and coming out against parenthood.''
   The bill would cover about half of all U.S. workers, and is
strongly opposed by business groups.
   It exempts businesses with fewer than 50 employees, and the
highest-paid 10 percent within a company.
   Roukema and several other supporters cited their own experiences
during debate.
   Roukema said she was fortunate enough to be able to stay at home
when her child was dying of leukemia. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said he was able to leave the Senate for prolonged periods when his
son Teddy was stricken with cancer.
   Dodd recalled that Bush cited a similar experience as well _ the
death of one of his young children _ during a 1988 debate with
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``Certainly having lived through that experience, he knows what
it's like to be in the midst of a family crisis,'' Dodd said.
``That goes on every minute of every day in this country, for
thousands and thousands of families.''
   Roukema said she had received no response from the White House
despite repeated requests for a meeting with Bush and Chief of
Staff John Sununu, who pledged to business lobbyists last month
that Bush would veto the bill.
   ``I fully expect that the president will give we Republicans who
support this bill the courtesy of a meeting prior to any action,''
she said. ``I'm appealing to him that he not take any action until
he hears from people like myself.''

   A private school building collapsed Friday
in the eastern oil city of Port Harcourt, killing at least 23
students and injuring 60, witnesses and hospital workers said.
   More than 300 policemen were digging through the collapsed
structure for 15 other students feared trapped in the rubble, a
police spokesman said.
   The accident occurred as about 200 students gathered for a
debate in a room on the third floor of the building, which was
still under construction, said one survivor, 19-year-old Elizabeth
Ikaedim.
   She said many of the students were trapped on a staircase when
they tried to flee as the walls began collapsing.
   The police spokesman said the owner of the building had been
arrested. A police source said the building owner did not have a
permit for the construction.

<HEAD>Soviets Propose Negotiations in Autumn on Tactical Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has urged the Western
allies to begin negotiations this fall to get rid of short-range
nuclear weapons in Europe, NATO officials said Friday.
   But alliance diplomats immediately dismissed the suggestion,
saying bargaining on nuclear arms should take place only after
agreement on an accord to reduce tanks, artillery and other
conventional weapons in Europe.
   ``We will stick to our timetable,'' said one diplomat, who
demanded anonymity. ``This is the logical way to proceed. First
things first.''
   The Kremlin has in the past pressed the Western nations for
early talks on nuclear weapons and, sources said, did so again this
week in a proposal to the United States in Washington.
   ``The Soviet Union proposed to the United States to start
negotiations on the elimination of SNF (short-range nuclear forces)
in the autumn of this year,'' said Florent Swijsen, spokesman for
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He said the offer would be discussed by President Bush and other
alliance leaders at a summit July 5-6 in London.
   Under the proposal, the Soviet Union wants to negotiate the
elimination not only of land-based nuclear arms in Europe, but also
air-launched systems, the sources said.
   It also would like to bring France's independent nuclear arsenal
into the talks, they said. France belongs to NATO but remains
outside its joint military structure.
   The issue of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe has become
increasingly controversial with the easing of tensions between NATO
and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The West's battlefield weapons, most based in West Germany,
would hit targets in now-friendly countries in Eastern Europe. The
term short-range is applied to weapons with ranges of less than
about 300 miles.
   The Western allies have agreed that there is a ``diminishing
need'' for short-range nuclear arms in their arsenal. Bush earlier
this year cancelled U.S. plans to build a more powerful version of
the Lance short-range missile and a modernized 155mm nuclear-tipped
artillery shell.
   Even so, the allies have continued to insist the Western defense
requires ``an appropriate mix'' of conventional and nuclear arms
``for the foreseeable future.''
   With a reduction in land-based forces, analysts expect NATO to
put more emphasis on air-launched nuclear systems. The United
States is developing a tactical air-to-surface missile (TASM),
which would replace gravity bombs. A West German official said last
week, however, that the Bonn government did not want the new
weapons based on its territory.
   NATO foreign ministers last week agreed at a meeting in Scotland
to support a Bush suggestion for a speedier timetable for
negotiations on short-range nuclear forces. They said those talks
could begin ``shortly after'' a conventional arms accord was
concluded.
   At a May 1989 summit, Bush and the other leaders had linked the
bargaining to implementation of the treaty.
   NATO diplomats reiterated their latest position.
   ``We have got to complete the CFE (conventional armed forces in
Europe) agreement and then get on with it,'' said one official, who
like the others demanded anonymity. ``There's enough to digest
before we get on with SNF,'' he said.
   Another diplomat said the conventional arms talks were ``quite
complicated'' and added: ``We shouldn't complicate them (further)
with new topics of negotiation.''
   A spokesman for the U.S. mission to NATO, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said, ``We note the continuing large imbalance in
Soviet short-range nuclear weapons. Elimination of this imbalance
is long overdue.''
   ``The United States is prepared to enter into talks for the
reduction of short-range nuclear systems as soon as the CFE talks
are completed,'' he said.
   The 16 NATO nations and the seven of the Warsaw Pact have said
they want to strike a conventional arms deal this year, although
Western officials have complained about Soviet foot-dragging.
   On Thursday, diplomats in Vienna said the two sides were close
to agreement on overall limits for tanks and armored combat
vehicles in Europe.
   Moscow and Washington already have agreed to limit their
stationed forces in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side. The
United States would retain an additional 30,000 troops in Britain
and southern Europe.

assistant attorney general for legislative affairs.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Rawls, 45, would succeed Carol T.

   McBride, 31, would succeed Michael Philip Skarzynski.
   At Bush's side throughout the day, McBride is in charge of the

vice president.
   Bush has not yet selected a replacement for McBride, whose
official title is special assistant to the president.

<TEXT>
   The first high-level Chinese delegation
to visit Vietnam since a border war in 1979 has ended talks on
improving relations between the nations, official Vietnamese radio
said.
   Radio Hanoi said Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xu Dunxin and
Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co held discussions
in Hanoi on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``The exchange of views took place in a friendly atmosphere and
helped enhance the understanding between the two countries,'' said
the broadcast, a text of which was seen in Bangkok on Friday.
   The broadcast said they exchanged views on the 11-year-old civil
war in Cambodia and on bilateral relations, but gave no other
details.
   China is the principal backer of three Cambodian guerrilla
factions fighting the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom
Penh. Earlier this month in Tokyo, the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
guerrilla faction, refused to sign a cease-fire pact. China also
refused to support the agreement.
   China supported North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, but
relations became strained in 1978 over border disputes and the
treatment of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam.
   China launched a brief border war in early 1979 in retaliation
for Vietnam's opposition to the Chinese-backed government in
Cambodia.

   Even if your chin couldn't cut sheetrock and you
don't have a two-way wrist radio, you, too, can look like Dick
Tracy _ thanks to a line of Tracy togs and accessories at a
department store near you.
   Nobody held a gun on the shoppers who turned out at Manhattan
stores Friday, kicking off the Tracy paraphernalia onslaught by
laying out cash for yellow fedoras ($30), Tracy towels ($20) and
Tracy T-shirts ($14).
   Want the great detective's jutting jaw on your face? $50 for a
mask. How about a denim jacket with his likeness across the back?
$115. A leather bomber jacket with the omnipresent Tracy logo?
$195. Or his trademark yellow trenchcoat? $345.
   Believe it, sweetheart. And stores were giving customers the
hard sell on the goods, which were generated by the incredibly
hyped Warren Beatty flick that opened nationally Friday.
   The second floor at Bloomingdale's featured a stack of eight
televisions running the movie's trailer non-stop. In another
section of The Dick Tracy Shop there, a tape of co-star Madonna
belted out ``Vogue'' and songs from the film soundtrack over and
over and over ...
   ``This is all for that movie?'' asked one woman as she handed
over $28 for a pair of T-shirts. The Tracy togs were so prevalent
that they _ gasp! _ displaced Bart Simpson and family from the top
of the T-shirt racks.
   ``It's great. My wife says they're quite well made, not
trashy,'' said Roger Dutton, a Melbourne, Australia, resident who
was clutching a pair of towels. ``You pay premium for the premium
goods, I guess.''
   In another section, lacy bustiers, flapper dresses and other
skin-flashing selections worn by Breathless Mahoney (that's
Madonna, folks) drew plenty of interest, but not as many buyers.
   ``If I could get away with this stuff in Kokomo, I'd wear it,''
said Linda Dechert, who was visiting from Indiana. ``I think this
stuff will catch on with the younger crowd. Madonna's so popular.''
   The Madonna-Breathless outfits aren't as daring as the ones that
cling to the singer in the movie. ``Some of her gowns were slit
down to the navel. We didn't go quite that far,'' said Elaine
Johnson of L.A. Glo, which is handling the clothes.
   At Macy's flagship 34th Street store, the eighth floor was
covered in Tracy yellow, with painted black silhouettes of Tracy
and his nemeses Big Boy and Flattop.
   ``Calling All Crimestoppers to Herald Square'' read a Macy's
newspaper ad, and more people than that responded. Although store
policy is not to release sales figures, things were going well on
Day One of the Tracy explosion.
   ``Our shop is well-traveled, quite popular,'' said Barbara
Lewinski, spokeswoman for the store. ``And once the film opens this
weekend, it should get bigger.''

<HEAD>Retail Prices Up 0.2 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
May, easing the strain on consumers' budgets for the second
straight month after a painful spurt in prices early in the year,
the government said Friday.
   In other economic news, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
trade deficit shrank to $6.94 billion in April, the second lowest
level in the last six years.
   And, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rebounded an
unexpectedly strong 0.6 percent last month after holding steady in
April.
   The April and May moderation in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index curbed inflation for the first five months of the year
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.8 percent.
   That's up significantly from the 4.6 percent rate for all of
last year, but down sharply from the worrisome 8.5 percent rate in
the first quarter.
   ``Inflation remains low and under control,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The better news on inflation was expected by most economists,
who said prices are recovering from weather-related increases for
food, energy and clothing. Prices for fuel oil and vegetables shot
up in January and February in reaction to an unusually severe
freeze around Christmas.
   After that, a warm spell stimulated early sales of more
expensive spring clothing lines, sending apparel costs higher.
   ``What you need to keep in mind here is that the moderation in
May is mainly an unwinding of the price spikes you got earlier in
the year,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
``Although we should be happy to get these kinds of numbers, they
are probably understating inflation just as the numbers at the
beginning of the year were overstating it.''
   Food prices rose only 0.1 percent last month after falling 0.2
percent a month earlier. Energy costs dropped 0.7 percent, the
fourth monthly decline following a large increase in January.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, often
taken as a better barometer of underlying inflation than the
overall calculation of prices, rose a moderate 0.3 percent after
increasing 0.2 percent a month earlier.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
129.2 in May. That means a hypothetical selection of goods and
services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost
$129.20 last month, up from $123.80 a year ago.
   The recent mild inflation meant that Americans' average weekly
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased 0.3 percent in
May. Still, for the last 12 months, earnings fell 0.1 percent.
Average weekly earnings in May, before adjusting for inflation,
were $344.31, up from $330.86 a year earlier.
   Both the 17 percent improvement in the trade gap and the
moderation of inflation were taken by analysts as a sign of a weak
domestic economy, which translates into lower demand for imports
and lower prices for goods in general.
   The industrial production report, although a sign of strength,
was considered somewhat of a fluke. Much of it was attributed to a
buildup in inventories by the Big Three automakers worried about a
strike in September.
   Opinion was mixed over whether economic weakness will prompt the
Federal Reserve to nudge short-term interest rates lower. Bond
prices plunged after the reports, a sign that traders believed the
economy was not weak enough nor inflation calm enough to trigger an
easier monetary policy.
   But Steinberg, noting the long lag between a change in policy
and a corresponding reaction in the economy, said, ``It seems to me
the Fed, if it doesn't want to see the economy weaken further, will
have to ease sometime in the near future, probably in July.''
   The department offered these other details of May consumer
prices:
   _Fruit and vegetable costs fell 2.4 percent, their third
substantial drop in a row. Vegetable prices soared 29.2 percent in
the first two months of the year before falling 23.6 percent in the
next three months. Dairy costs fell for the third consecutive month
while prices were up for sweets, fats and oils and beverages.
   _Fuel oil costs declined 1.4 percent; natural gas, 2.7 percent.
Electricity charges rose 1 percent. Gasoline prices rose modestly,
but less than usual for the start of the warm weather driving
season. Thus, after seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices were
reported down 1.6 percent.
   _Clothing costs fell 0.3 percent. Prices for men's clothing rose
0.4 percent, but the cost of women's and children's clothing fell 1
percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
   _New car prices edged down 0.2 percent, their fourth consecutive
decline in the face of sluggish sales.
   _The price of medical care jumped 0.8 percent in May for the
fourth consecutive month, pushing those costs 9 percent higher than
a year ago.

   Jean MacArthur, the 91-year-old widow of
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, had her long-time pal Barbara Bush at her
side Friday when she cut a ribbon to open a new research center of
the MacArthur Memorial.
   Mrs. MacArthur said it was her first speech. ``I left all that
to the general,'' she said.
   ``When I was with my husband during World War II, I visited many
of the hospitals and I used to say to myself that I was so proud of
the American military because they were so proud of being
Americans,'' Mrs. MacArthur said.
   ``She stood by the general through Corregidor, Australia and
Japan,'' Mrs. Bush said of her friend. ``This quiet, gentle woman
is loved by all who know her.''
   MacArthur commanded American troops in the Pacific during World
War II and oversaw the occupation of Japan at the end of the war.
He also was commander of United Nations forces in Korea before
being relieved in 1951 by President Truman.
   The $1.1 million expansion of the MacArthur Memorial was paid
for through private donations. The city-owned memorial draws 80,000
visitors a year. MacArthur's body is entombed there.

   Elizabeth Taylor was home
recuperating Friday, ``very weak'' but in good condition after a
two-month fight with pneumonia, her spokeswoman said.
   ``She's doing fine,'' Taylor's spokeswoman Chen Sam said Friday.
   The violet-eyed actress, with hair coiffed and makeup on, waved
and smiled to reporters Thursday night as she was driven from the
hospital toward her Beverly Hills home.
   ``She's very weak from having been in the hospital for a very
long time but thank heaven she's home,'' Ms. Sam said.
   Miss Taylor, 58, will stay home for a couple of months, Ms. Sam
said.
   The New York publicist quoted Miss Taylor as saying, ``I am
finally glad to be going home. My sole concern at this time is
focused on my getting well and carrying on with my life.''
   Miss Taylor was in St. John's since April 16. She had been in
the hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of viral
pneumonia. At one point in late April, her breathing was assisted
by a ventilator.
   The screen beauty has won two Oscars. She starred in
``Butterfield 8,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' ``Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof'' and more than 50 other films.

   Country music star Randy Travis says his
current single record, ``He Walked on Water,'' brings back memories
of his own grandfather.
   The song is about a boy's relationship with his
great-grandfather and was written by Allen Shamblin.
   ``I had a grandfather that I can relate that to, very much so,''
Travis said. ``I used to ride with him on the tractor and go with
him in his car everywhere he went, ride on the horse if he was
plowing with the horse.''
   He says once he ran over his grandfather's hat with his bicycle
after being warned to be careful.
   ``He caught me by the arm, jerked me off that bicycle and popped
me one time real good,'' Travis said. ``I ran off and got a few
feet from him and picked up a handful of rocks and started throwing
them at him. So he started throwing them back at me.
   ``It was funny, neighbors driving by and here's this man _ he
was about 60 at that time _ and his grandkid out there throwing
rocks at each other.''

<HEAD>Largest Gold Producers to Curtail Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's two largest
gold-producing companies said Friday they were curtailing
operations due to the falling price of gold. More than 7,800 people
were to lose their jobs as a result.
   Anglo-American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said two of its mining
companies _ Free State State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd.
(Freegold) and Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Co. Ltd. _ would
cut back on their operations.
   Earlier this week, two other mining groups outside the
Anglo-American conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1,100
workers.
   Gold is South Africa's major industry, earning more than half
the country's foreign currency.
   Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo-American's gold and
uranium division said the company had made efforts in recent months
to maintain existing levels of operation, including cost-reduction
measures and deferment of expenditures.
   ``Despite these efforts, at current gold prices and operating
costs, certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining
operations at their present levels,'' Hewitt said.
   The price of gold reached a four-year low of $346.25 per ounce
in New York and London before recovering Thursday. It was trading
at $347.50 per ounce in New York on Friday afternoon.
   Hewitt said the cutback would take place over the next nine
months, and probably result in the loss of 7,800 jobs at Freegold.
   He said reducing operations at Vaal Reefs would not necessarily
involve loss of jobs, because workers may be assigned to other
areas of the mine.
   ``Vaal Reefs has greater flexibility in the opening of new ore
reserves than Freegold,'' Hewitt said.
   On Wednesday, General Mining Union Corp. announced its marginal
operation Stilfontein Gold Mining Co. Ltd. would lay off 500
workers immediately to cut costs in the face of the low gold price.
Anglovaal Ltd. said its Loraine Gold Mines Ltd. would lay off 600
workers and reduce production by 10 percent during the next four
months.
   Hewitt said Anglo-American management had invited discussions
with union leaders about the curtailments. There was no immediate
reaction from the unions.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the nations' largest black
union, representing some 250,000 black miners, has already declared
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations
with the mining industry.
   South Africa has the deepest gold mines in the world, and the
cost of mining increases with the depth.
   The relatively cheap labor, with an average black miner earning
from $300 to $400 per month, is one reason why South African mines
can continue to be profitable at great depths.
   Curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step,
because once a particular shaft is shut down, the infrastructure
often deteriorates rapidly. That would make it costly and dangerous
to start up again when the price of gold rises.

   Top Soviet leaders declared Friday they had won
legislative support for a market economy despite rejection of an
immediate price increase for bread and demands for a more detailed
blueprint of the transition.
   Comments by the head of Soviet economic planning and the
chairman of the legislature, both members of the Communist Party
Politburo, reflected the government's shaky approach to reform
despite months of study.
   The government program presented by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
last month caused panic buying that left half-empty store shelves
even barer.
   Yuri D. Maslyukov, the chairman of the State Planning
Commission, told reporters Friday that the Supreme Soviet
legislature was right to posptone the first phase of a bread price
increase Ryzhkov proposed for July 1.
   ``The opinion of the government is that probably, considering
the importance of the matter, the decision of the session is
correct,'' Maslyukov said. ``We will look into that matter one more
time, because a mistake would cost it the confidence of the
people.''
   Bread is the staple of the Soviet diet, and prices have remained
unchanged for decades.
   But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pushing for the economic
reform program, told Soviets on the eve of his summit trip to
Washington that bread is so cheap that children sometimes use
loaves for soccer balls. At the same time, the Soviet government is
forced to use up precious hard currency reserves to ensure there is
enough grain by importing it, he said.
   Maslyukov and Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly I. Lukyanov, a
Gorbachev protege who fulfills many of the functions of a vice
president, held news conferences Friday, a day after the
legislature finished its spring session, to give the government's
evaluation.
   ``The president and the government have been granted the right
to make necessary decisions to prepare the transition to a market
economy,'' Maslyukov said.
   Both acknowledged that the government economic plan required
more work.
   ``It has become clear that new models aren't created on the run,
with one wave of the hand,'' Lukyanov said. ``Time is needed, and
to take into account many other factors, and to weigh all the
details, and to think.''
   ``It's a new revolution, in principle. Of course it needs
perfecting,'' he said.
   The plan presented by Ryzhkov had been in the works for months.
   But after two weeks of debate, the Supreme Soviet told the
government to come back with more detailed plans when it reconvenes
in September.
   The plan calls for food prices to be doubled Jan. 1, rapid
conversion of state-owned enterprises to stock companies and the
gradual sale of stocks to the public. It would permit certain
companies and industries to contract directly for their supplies
and to sell their products in a free market. Unprofitable firms
would go bankrupt.
   Maslyukov reiterated that the country probably would have its
first nationwide referendum on the economic package, but only after
more detailed plans are presented to the Supreme Soviet in the fall.
   The legislature must approve the plan before it is presented for
a referendum, which likely will include two main questions _ the
speed of economic reform and the methods of compensating consumers
for the higher costs.
   Asked about another key area of economic change, monetary
reform, Maslyukov said the Soviet ruble would have to be devalued
several times to bring it closer to market values.
   To make the currency convertible on the world market, the
government must drastically cut its budget deficit, he said. That
means reducing spending on capital construction, defense and
foreign aid, Maslyukov said.
   By 1993, government plans call for foreign firms to be able to
reinvest in the Soviet Union rubles they have earned in the
country, and by 1995 for the ruble to be convertible.
   But other Soviet economic officials have said that such
predictions of full convertibility are too optimistic. Deputy
Premier Leonid A. Abalkin has said that it likely will take many
years to make the ruble convertible.

<HEAD>Soviet Performers Get Warm Welcome From Rural Minnesota Hosts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sixty Soviet dancers, singers and
acrobats got a taste of rural Americana with a visit to a dairy
farm and a backyard feast of fried chicken, potato salad and beer.
   ``President Gorbachev didn't have time,'' host Gary Meyer said,
referring to the Soviet leader's canceled visit to a Minnesota
dairy farm after the Washington sumit two weeks ago. ``Maybe this
makes up a little for that.''
   The Leningrad State Music Hall troupe picnicked, sang and
performed Thursday in this hamlet about 35 miles west of the Twin
Cities.
   They feasted on traditional American backyard fare and washed
the meal down with vodka before singing ``America the Beautiful.''
   Then it was down the road to Don and Alice Leuer's dairy farm.
Mrs. Leuer welcomed the performers with 20 dozen chocolate chip and
peanut butter cookies.
   ``It is like a fairy tale here,'' said Irena Charchevnikova, a
dancer. ``There is a very warm feeling from the people, and we feel
very much at home.''
   Meyer's wife, Sara, arranged the grassroots cultural exchange
during a visit last weekend to Minneapolis, where the troupe is
performing.
   The troupe was scheduled to perform at the Orpheum Theatre in
Minneapolis through the weekend before going to Chicago. It is the
first U.S. tour of the 24-year-old troupe, which has performed in
more than 40 countries.

<HEAD>Government Urged to Improve Safety Before Arms Plant Restart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of two congressional committees
urged Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Friday to take new steps
to improve safety practices at the Savannah River nuclear arms
plant before allowing it to resume operation.
   Watkins should insist that operators of Savannah River's nuclear
reactors, which make tritium gas for nuclear warheads, meet the
safety standards of the commercial nuclear industry, said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, and Rep. Mike Synar, D-Oklahoma.
   ``It is critical ... to change the disturbing mindset of
complacency that has been embedded at the Savannah River plant for
many years,'' Glenn said. ``The Energy Department still has a long
way to go.''
   The legislators were responding to a report by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that said the
Savannah River operation had not yet made sufficient improvements
in safety practices and attitudes.
   The GAO report said that under current Energy Department plans,
the reactor operators at Savannah River would not be required to
meet commercial industry training standards prior to restart.
   The report recommended that Watkins require Westinghouse
Savannah River Co., which runs the plant for the government, to
carry out a comprehensive plan for changing the ``safety culture''
there before it resumes reactor operation.
   The plant is on a 315-square-mile federal reservation near
Aiken, S.C.
   The report also said that efforts to further improve safety
practices and attitudes, in addition to several other management
and environmental issues, could delay the planned restart of
Savannah River reactors by as much as two years.
   Watkins has said he hopes to have the first of the three active
Savannah River reactors back in operation by January, although no
final restart date has been set. The reactors are the nation's only
source of tritium, a radioactive gas that must be replenished in
warheads because it decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year.
   The reactors were closed down in 1988 because of safety,
mechanical and management problems.
   Last week two environmental groups, the Natural Resources
Defense Council of New York and the Energy Research Foundation of
Columbia, S.C., filed suit in federal court in Aiken challenging
Watkins' plan for restarting the reactors.
   The suit demanded that restart be blocked until the department
completes construction of a cooling tower for reactor discharges,
or until President Bush exempts the plant from the Clean Water Act
on national security grounds. The tower is scheduled for completion
in 1992.

   East German police said Friday they arrested
four West German fugitives, striking a major blow to the core of
West Germany's leftist terrorist movement.
   All four were arrested late Thursday. One was later freed
because charges against her had expired; it was not certain whether
West Germany would file the charges again.
   The East German government initially said it also had captured
three other wanted fugitives but retracted that statement late
Friday.
   ``The three people arrested today in Leipzig are not the hunted
Red Army Faction terrorists Barbara Meyer, Horst Ludwig Meyer and
Sabine Callsen,'' the government-run news agency ADN said in a
brief news flash.
   It gave no explanation for the earlier, incorrect information
issued by the Interior Ministry and did not say whether the three
arrested were even suspected of being involved in terrorist
activities.
   Despite the erroneous report, the arrests of the four fugitives
in Frankfurt an der Oder and Cottbus _ together with two arrests on
Wednesday _ were significant for West German authorities.
   Authorities consider the fugitives to be among the leaders of
the Red Army Faction terror gang, which waged a murderous war
against West German capitalism in the 1970s and 1980s.
   All had been living in East Germany under assumed names, and
West German officials said the arrests go a long way toward
confirming long-held suspicions that East Germany's former
Communist government once harbored terrorists.
   Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters the federal
government had indications for several years that East Germany's
former secret police sheltered the fugitives.
   Klein said, however, the indications were vague and that West
Germans would have run into ``an iron wall'' had they tried to
raise the issue with the former East German leaders.
   In East Berlin, Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel told a
news conference he was unable to confirm widespread speculation
that terrorists had used East Germany as a base for attacks.
   But he promised to seek prosecution of any former officials who
harbored the terrorists under the Communist regime.
   In Hamburg, conservative West German lawmaker Eduard Lintner
demanded the extradition of ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker
to face charges of having supported terrorism.
   Authorities identified those arrested Thursday as Monika
Helbing, 36, and Ekkehard von Seckendorff-Gudent, 49, arrested in
Frankfurt an der Oder; and Werner Lotze, 38, and Christine
Duemlein, 41, arrested in Cottbus.
   Ms. Helbing and Seckendorff-Gudent are married, as are Lotze and
Ms. Duemlein.
   Ms. Helbing and Lotze allegedly were involved in the 1977
kidnap-slaying of West German industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer
and numerous other terrorist crimes.
   Ms. Duemline was wanted on charges of being a member of a
terrorist organization to overthrow the state, and an arrest
warrant was issued for her in 1978. It was dropped in 1988 after
the warrant expired by law, and East German officials she was freed
after her capture because it had not been renewed.
   Ekkehard von Seckendorff-Gudent was wanted as a Red Army Faction
sympathiser. As a doctor, he had a permanent visitors pass to a
Hamburg prison, which authorities said he gave to suspected
terrorists to visit jailed compatriots.
   As East Germany and West Germany move toward unification, the
countries are cooperating closely. Now, West German wanted posters
are seen throughout the East, and other fugitives among two dozen
hard-core leaders could be arrested.
   The retraction late Friday leaves the Meyers some of West
Germany's most-hunted fugitives.
   The couple is accused of a car bomb attack that killed two
people and wounded 20 others at the U.S. Air Force's Rhein-Main Air
Base near Frankfurt in August 1985.

   An Air Force enlistee was sentenced Friday to 10
years in prison without parole for attempting to sell secrets to
the Soviets.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater imposed the sentence on
former Airman Ronald Craig Wolf, 35, who pleaded guilty in February
to one count of attempting to transfer national defense information
to the Soviet Union.
   FBI Special Agent Bobby R. Gillham said agents began
investigating Wolf in 1989, when they received information that he
intended to sell sensitive classified information to the Soviet
Union. Wolf was arrested in May 1989 after selling information to
an undercover FBI agent posing as a Soviet agent.
   Wolf enlisted in the Air Force in July 1974 in Dallas. He held a
security clearance and received training in Russian before his 1981
discharge.
   He transcribed sensitive communications while serving in the Far
East, Gillham said.
   Wolf had been working in automobile sales since his discharge,
the FBI said.
   Wolf was arrested near the Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, where he had planned to fly to the Soviet Union to defect
after meeting with the undercover FBI agent, officials said.

   The United States has donated 25,000 metric
tons of surplus corn to Honduras as part of an expanded food-aid
package, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the corn's value is $2.2
million. The grain will be sold by the Honduran government to the
private sector to help meet food and industrial needs.
   Proceeds from the sales will be earmarked to provide food
assistance to needy families and to help farmers in projects to
increase production and marketing.
   Dickerson said the program is carried out by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
   The corn donation boosts Honduran food aid to $3.4 million from
an initial $1.2 million announced on March 9, he said.

<TEXT>
   Paraguayan President Andres Rodriguez asked
President Bush for trade benefits Friday. Bush sought increased
Paraguayan efforts on anti-drug operations, officials said.
   The two met briefly in the Oval Office during a stopover by
Rodriguez en route to Taiwan and South Korea.
   ``President Bush told President Rodriguez that we would like to
cooperate more intensively with Paraguay to prevent drug
traffickers from establishing a foothold in that country,'' said
Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   U.S. officials have expressed concern that Paraguay is becoming
an increasingly active transshipment point for drugs produced in
other South American countries. Dozens of private airstrips have
been reported in remote sections of Paraguay used by drug
trafficking planes.
   While Rodriguez is seen as making some efforts against illegal
drugs, his cooperation so far has not been effective, said one
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Rodriguez asked Bush to restore the system of Generalized
Special Preferences trade benefits for Paraguay, Fitzwater said in
a statement. The GSP is designed to allow third-world nations to
ship their products to the United States duty free or with low
tariffs.
   Under U.S. regulations, countries that violate basic labor
rights can be denied the GSP privileges. Paraguay is among the
nations to be sanctioned in recent years on such grounds.
   In a photo session before their meeting, Rodriguez expressed
hopes Bush would help his country's new move toward democracy.
   Rodriguez, a military general, was elected last year after he
overthrew dictator Gen. Alfred Stroessner.
   ``I feel very confident that the leader of the world's
democracies will help me in Paraguay to replant democracy in this
transitional period that we're going through,'' Rodriguez told Bush
at the start of their session.
   Bush said the United States is ``pleased with this noble
beginning you've made and watching with great interest'' as
Paraguay undertakes reforms.
   Rodriguez later characterized his brief meeting with Bush as
``marvelous.''
   The Paraguayan later had lunch with Vice President Dan Quayle,
who visited Paraguay in March.
   Quayle said that during that visit he had pressed Rodriguez for
progress on human rights and labor rights.
   A 1990 State Department report on human rights in Paraguay said
the Rodriguez government has taken significant steps to reverse
repression that was prevalent under Stroessner, but greater strides
are needed.
   The report said government corruption remained a problem.

<HEAD>Israeli Leaders Seeking U.S. Support for Middle East Peace</HEAD>

   Israeli leaders said Friday they were seeking
U.S. support to ``start from the beginning'' with Middle East peace
initiatives.
   The new position emerged as the Israelis responded to sharp
remarks by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who urged
Israel's new right-wing government to move to resume the stalled
peace process.
   Baker, testifying before a Senate committee on Wednesday,
recited the telephone number of the White House switchboard and
said: ``When you're serious about this, call us.''
   But Foreign Minister David Levy said in an interview published
Friday that Israel must ``clarify to the United States that a peace
move is fateful for us and cannot depend on a `yes' or `no' answer
to one single question.''
   The question Levy referred to was Baker's October proposal for a
preliminary Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Egypt.
   The talks would be toward ending the 30-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule of the territories. At least 717
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians and
45 Israelis have also died.
   The Palestinian delegation to any peace talks, according to
Baker, should include people living in exile and those who have
homes in both the occupied territories and annexed east Jerusalem.
   The formula was intended as a compromise between Israel's
refusal to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
PLO demand that Palestinians outside the territories be included in
talks.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud bloc, fearing
Baker's terms would lead Israel to de facto negotiations with the
PLO and raise the issue of Jerusalem, has failed to give a positive
answer.
   In March, Likud's coalition with the center-left Labor Party
fell apart over Shamir's stalling. Shamir formed a new government
Monday.
   ``The answer to Baker was not negative, but we have to remember
that the train got off the tracks, both because of Baker's
questions and because the government fell apart,'' Levy told the
daily Yediot Ahronot.
   ``Therefore you cannot say now: we set the train in motion from
exactly the same spot, despite the fact there are no tracks,'' he
said.
   A top Shamir aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, said Friday: ``We are
asking to start from the beginning ... to get the process on a
track that will not lead us to negotiations with a delegation
composed by the PLO, and that will lead us into the danger of a
Palestinian state.''
   ``It is unacceptable that they (the Americans) return exactly to
this point and propose the same questions to the new government
that has been formed,'' Ben-Aharon said on Israel army radio.
   Israel, in accordance with its May 1989 peace initiative, says
Palestinian representatives should be chosen in elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The plan also offers
Palestinians an interim period of self-rule, with their final
status to be determined in later negotiations.
   Baker said Wednesday: ``there won't be any dialogue, there won't
be any peace'' if Israel's new government makes unacceptable
demands for Palestinian participation in peace talks.
   Meanwhile, dozens of police patrolled East Talpiot and two
neighboring Arab villages where the stabbing of an 11-year-old
Jewish schoolboy Thursday set off anti-Arab riots. No further
incidents were reported, however.
   Also Friday, Arab writers' groups protested the arrest of poet
Shafik Habib, detained on suspicion that his latest collection of
poems could incite anti-Israeli violence. Habib was taken from his
home in the village of Deir Hana near Nazareth on Wednesday.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Friday deplored the throwing of a tear-gas grenade by Israeli
forces into a maternity and children's clinic in the Gaza Strip
this week.
   In all, 57 infants were treated for inhaling tear gas. The
incident occurred when Israeli soldiers persuing Arab stone
throwers ran into the U.N. health center.

<HEAD>Congressmen Criticize Keeping Executives After Taking Over S&amp;Ls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats criticized savings and loan
bailout officials Friday for hiring high-paid consultants, keeping
executives of failed thrifts on the job and continuing to pay
others who perform no work.
   Congress is hearing ``growing reports of overpaid individuals
running (government)-held institutions ... of officers from failed
institutions staying on the government payroll with six-figure
salaries,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the House
S&amp;L bailout task force.
   ``At a time when it is reported that the total cost to the
taxpayer is growing at an ever-increasing rate, why is the
(Resolution Trust Corp.) continuing these megadollar salaries for a
work product that at best is mediocre and at worst is a proven
failure?'' he asked.
   Vento cited three cases:
   _Two government-controlled thrifts in Orange County, Calif. _
Mercury Savings and Western Empire Savings _ continued to pay six
former officers even though they no longer worked for the
institutions.
   _Wallace Associates, a Salt Lake City firm, received $500,000 to
manage Midwest Savings Association in Minneapolis for a year.
   _The managing agent at Franklin Savings Association in Ottawa,
Kan., is receiving $220,000 for his first six months on the job.
   RTC chief executive officer David Cooke said that in the
California institutions, top executives were placed on paid
administrative leave until their thrifts were placed in
receiverships and their employment contracts could be legally
broken.
   Cooke said the agency usually is able to break such contracts
swiftly but in the case of some large, complex institutions must
maintain them for several months.
   ``Some of these sweetheart management deals they cut for
themselves ... are almost ironclad legally,'' said Michael J.
Martinelli, the RTC's regional director in Kansas City, Mo.
   In the case of Midwest Savings, the consulting firm was
replacing even higher paid executives, Martinelli said. The manager
hired for Franklin Savings was worth his salary because he had the
expertise necessary to deal with the thrift's complex securities
portfolio, he said.
   Cooke said top executives were retained at 211 of 351 thrifts
seized by the government through April 13. Of those, salaries
remained unchanged at 124, were lowered at 51 and raised at 36.
Salary reductions for top executives at seized thrifts have saved
taxpayers nearly $35 million, he said.
   ``It is important to understand that in many cases the senior
management in institutions taken into conservatorship are not
dishonest or incompetent and are not the ones who caused the
institution to fail,'' he added.
   However, Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash., questioned whether any
employees of a failed thrift above the level of secretary or teller
should be retained when a new government-controlled thrift is
created.
   ``The question is, `Are you allowing the virus that took down
one S&amp;L to move to the next S&amp;L?''' he said.

<HEAD>Indians Say Treaty Disputes Should be Settled Locally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Indians from Wisconsin tribes told
county government representatives Friday they should negotiate
settlements to their problems instead of forming a national
organization to challenge treaties.
   ``To me it's sad we can't sit down in our own areas and resolve
our problems,'' Purcell Powless, chairman of the Oneida tribe, told
a meeting run by the Wisconsin County Association.
   ``Whether you like me or not, I'm here and my people are going
to be here a long time,'' he said.
   Powless was among 12 tribal representatives who spoke to the
conference of county officials working to form a national coalition
on federal Indian policy.
   ``I don't believe there is a need for the things they are trying
to do,'' said Joe Bresette, a Chippewa Indian and executive
director of the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council. ``There is a
presumption that there is us and them. We don't believe that.''
   Trouble erupted at the first meeting of the coalition last
January in Salt Lake City, because Indians were excluded. This
time, the coalition organizers complied with the Indians' desire to
speak earlier than originally scheduled.
   The idea for a coalition arose from a dispute between the
Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin and 20 counties over timber rights.
The Indians say federal treaties give them the right to harvest on
1.8 million acres of land the counties claim.
   The case is pending in federal court with briefs due June 26
from both sides on whether the treaties should be reopened.
   Mark Rogacki, executive director of the Wisconsin County
Association, said the dispute led his group to contact counties in
other states with similar problems.
   ``There are common threads of Indian policy that run through the
country,'' said Rogacki. ``We want (federal government officials)
to conduct hearings all across the nation to find out what the
problems are.''
   He said the issues now in courts could be eliminated if Congress
adjusted the treaties.
   Eighteen county representatives from five states were at the
conference, which was called to discuss how to get the National
Association of Counties to make the coalition a part of its
activities, said Rogacki.
   Rita Kenshena, tribal attorney for the Menominee tribe, said she
and the other Indians hoped to stress the need to work locally to
settle the disputes.
   ``The Indian tribes are more informed about their governments
and treaties (than the county officials),'' she said.
   Keith Ferris, chairman of the conference, said he planned to ask
the tribes in Wisconsin whether they would be willing to
re-establish a local board that brought together county and tribal
leaders to discuss the various problems that arise.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Friday it has
issued a permit for the first field trials in the United States of
genetically engineered corn.
   The permit clears the way for BioTechnica Agriculture Inc. of
Overland Park, Kan., to begin its tests this month in Lisbon, Iowa,
said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Glosser said the tests will continue through the summer and that
the company's procedures were designed carefully so as not to
disturb the environment.
   The corn being tested differes from standard seed only in that
it contains genetic marker genes. These will allow scientists to
map more exactly the locations on chromosomes of genes that
determine the corn's characteristics, including yield and
resistance to diseases.
   Once the genes are located, researchers can manipulate and
eventually introduce them into new corn varieties and other crops
as well.
   Glosser said BioTechnia scientists already have examined the
experimental corn plants in the greehouse and want to repeat the
studies under field conditions.
   The corn project follows announcement earlier this week of
similar field trials for soybeans and rice.
   Monsanto Agricultural Co. of St. Louis won approval for field
tests of generically engineered soybeans this summer in Arkansas,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska,
Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Those experiments are being conducted to test soybean tolerance
to the widely used herbicide glyphosate, also known commercially as
Roundup.
   Scientists at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, are
testing rice that has been altered so its genes can be mapped for
later manipulation and use in new varieties.

   A single-engine plane on the
next-to-last stop of a 48-state peace tour crashed near an airport
runway Friday, killing both people on board, authorities said.
   The plane, attempting to set a speed record for flying to state
capitals, struck the top of a tree in a park about a half-mile
short of the Yeager Airport runway, where it was attempting to land
at about 8:30 a.m., said Sgt. Vic Gazitano of the Kanawha County
Sheriff's Department.
   The plane spun around and landed on its nose, with the right
wing torn off in several pieces, Gazitano.
   Killed were retired Air Force Col. Frank Martineau, 69, of
Bethesda, Md., and Marjorie Zeuch, 67, of Warwick, R.I., said Maj.
Robert Wolfe of the Air National Guard in Charleston.
   ``He had fuel on board and the landing gear was down,'' said
Frank Gurish, a Federal Aviation Administrator investigator at the
scene. ``It would appear he was of the notion he was on a normal
landing pattern. It was on course. It was just lower than he should
have been.''
   Martineau, an editor of Association Trends, a national weekly
newspaper for associations, and Zeuch, president of the World
Friendship Association in Warwick, were on the last leg of a
4,000-mile peace promotion trip, said Chuck Davenport, managing
editor of Association Trends, based in Bethesda.
   ``The main purpose of `Operation Appleseed' was to present state
charters for the World Friendship Association, a 2-year-old
charitable organization dedicated to bringing ordinary people of
the world closer together for permanent peace,'' Davenport said.
   Martineau and Zeuch were scheduled to complete the trip Friday
afternoon at Washington National Airport in Virginia.
   A friend of Martineau said the two had met through their common
interest in flying.
   ``She had this mission of spreading friendship and Frank thought
this would be a good project for the association to be involved
with,'' said Ed Cornish of Bethesda, whose son is married to
Martineau's daughter.
   The plane, which began its journey May 29 in Providence, R.I.,
took off from Columbus, Ohio, at 7 a.m., Ohio Aviation Chief John
Cornett said. Cornett said the pair had arrived Thursday afternoon
in Columbus.
   ``I'm trying to get a handle on it myself. It's very tragic
because they were very nice people,'' Cornett said.

<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists said Friday their
victory in this week's local elections marks a first step toward
taking power, but they appealed to supporters to guard against
trouble from ``enemies of Islam.''
   Many Algerians abandoned Western garb for traditional dress
Friday, and some fundamentalists entered bars and restaurants to
tell owners to curtail alcohol sales in the wake of Tuesday's
election gains.
   The leader of the victorious Islamic Salvation Front, Sheikh
Abassi Madani, denies his party is fundamentalist. However, it
backs the imposition of Islamic law in Algeria, where rule has been
secular.
   After the vote, hundreds of fundamentalists celebrated all night
in Algiers, the capital. They paraded through the streets with
banners reading ``God is great!'' and ``Islamic Republic!''
   ``The army and people are with you, Madani!'' youths shouted.
   Madani, at a prayer service Friday attended by about 30,000
people, said Algeria had ``taken the first step on the path toward
an Islamic solution.''
   However, the front's No. 2 official, Ali Belhadj, told
worshipers that ultimate victory depended on ``vigilance at all
times against the enemies of Islam in Algeria and abroad,
especially in France.'' He did not identify them.
   His movement's unexpectedly strong victory alarmed many Moslem
moderates at home, in France and elsewhere. France was the colonial
ruler of this North African nation until it became independent in
1962, and Tuesday's elections were the country's first multiparty
voting.
   Belhadj said Algerians who opposed the front should move to
France.
   Right-wing French leaders have warned the front's victory will
lead to a mass exodus of Algerian refugees to France, where
millions of North Africans already live.
   In Algiers, several dozen human rights and women's rights
activists announced Friday the formation of a coalition. The new
``Forum for Democracy'' will work to protect civil liberties and
ensure a full civic role for women, its leaders said.
   The Islamic front relegates women to a subservient role. None of
its candidates were women.
   Many Algerians who normally wear Western clothing appeared on
the streets Friday in traditional garb _ men in floor-length shirts
called ``khamisses'' and women wearing veils and scarves.
   Khadija Messaoudi, a founder of the new rights coalition and
president of a women's group, said many women donned the
traditional clothing ``in order to go out in the streets'' without
harassment.,
   Madani has said women will not be forced to wear the Islamic
scarf, or hijab, but his followers have steadily pressured female
students and teachers to adopt the traditional garb.
   Though fundamentalists seized power in the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran, many Arab states suppress their fundamentalist
movements. Iran's official media has cheered the Algerian win,
saying, ``In this favorable terrain, Islam can spread very
quickly.''
   Pressing a bid for political power in Algeria, Madani has asked
the government to dissolve Parliament and hold early elections. He
has also suggested a coalition with the ruling National Liberation
Front.
   Officials have not responded to either request.
   Madani told journalists Friday his party, if it won legislative
elections, would be willing to operate under President Chadli
Bendjedid, whose five-year term expires at the end of 1993.
   Madani has not ruled out the possibility that he would seek the
presidency. His party won 60 percent of the municipal councils at
stake in Tuesday's elections.

<BYLINE>Flooding from the Central Plains to the Central Atlantic Coast.
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms covered large sections of the country
Friday and caused flooding from the central Plains to the central
Atlantic Coast.
   In the Ohio River town of Shadyside, Ohio, a flash flood caused
fatalities and left many missing or homeless. Gov. Richard Celeste
declared a state of emergency and National Guards were being sent
to the area.
   A wall of water near Lindsay in eastern Nebraska carried 18 cars
out of a parking lot, and flooding forced the evacuation of a
three-block portion of Platte Center. In southern Nebraska,
flooding closed underpasses near Grand Island.
   Flooding spread thorugh east-central and northeast Kansas and
over west-central Iowa. The Salyersville fire department in eastern
Kentucky was flooded with seven inches of water and roads were
closed. Flooding was also reported in West Virginia and Delaware.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across the Carolinas and fell
in Virginia, West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania.
   Rain also fell on sections of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin
and South Dakota. And showers reached from west-central and eastern
Arkansas across northern Mississippi.
   Rainshowers were scattered from northwestern North Dakota across
northern Montana and along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Cities receiving the heaviest rainfall included Lynchburg, Va.,
with 1.75 inches and Topeka, Kan., with 1{ inches. In 45 minutes,
more than three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in Aberdeen, S.D.,
and caused minor street flooding.
   Temperatures climbed into the 100s across extreme southwest
Tennessee and unusually hot weather along with high humidity
covered Arkansas.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 early Friday was 28 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.

   A 9-year-old girl said she was swept down
a creek into the Ohio River during a flash flood and stayed alive
for seven hours by hanging on to logs and ``just drifted'' until
she reached shore Friday morning.
   Amber Colvin was in her family's home playing a card game with a
neighbor when the storm hit Thursday night. The house started to
fill with water.
   Amber said her 12-year-old friend, Kerrie Trigg, wanted to get
in the bathtub.
   ``We got in the bathtub, and the water was over our heads and
then the house collapsed,'' Amber said from her Bellaire City
Hospital room.
   She doesn't know why they got in the tub but remembers Kerrie
being hit on the head, knocking her out. Kerrie was still missing
on Friday.
   ``I tried to save her,'' Amber said. ``I almost drowned. I was
swept out of the house.''
   Amber was swept down Wegee Creek and then into the nearby Ohio
River. Although she can only swim a little, she said she kept
kicking her legs and hung on to two logs.
   ``I had them for a long time,'' she said. ``I just drifted.''
   She said she was in the water from about 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. She
tried to work her way to the shore to get to a factory where her
father worked. She reached shore about seven miles from her home.
   Her mother, Karen, said the last time she saw her daughter was
at 9:30 p.m. She said she and her husband, Dennis, went into town
to do some shopping but could not return and didn't know until 2
a.m. that their house was swept away and Amber was gone.
   The Colvins stayed at the Jefferson Elementary School, where
authorities set up a command center to coordinate rescue efforts.
They eventually were told that Amber was found alive.
   Amber's parents met the emergency squad as it went through
Shadyside.
   ``I can't begin to tell you how she looked. I don't know who was
in shock more _ me or her,'' Karen said as tears swelled in her
eyes.
   ``Her hands and feet had no color. She had her senses, but you
just could tell she had been in the water. All she talked about was
Kerrie. We prayed all night.''
   Amber suffered no broken bones. She was listed in fair condition
in the hospital, suffering from scrapes and other minor injuries.
   Kerrie's grandmother, Shirley Trigg, was being counseled at the
school.
   ``The doctors say you have to have hope, something about
miracles. Miracles do happen, but this is a nightmare,'' Trigg said.
   Thursday night's thunderstorms caused flash flooding across a
wide area of central and eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia and
western Pennsylvania. The floods closed roads, damaged homes and
forced hundreds of people to evacuate homes. But no place was hit
with anything approaching the ferocity of the flooding in Shadyside.
   About 5.5 inches of rain fell between 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
turning two Ohio River tributaries outside the village of 4,300
people into torrents.

<HEAD>West Germany Says It Has Foiled IRA Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government, fighting an
outbreak of IRA violence, said Friday it has thwarted a number of
planned attacks by the terrorist group.
   The announcement came the same day the Irish Republican Army
claimed responsibility for an explosion Thursday that damaged an
unoccupied building at a British Army training center near Hameln,
West Germany. No one was hurt in that blast.
   On June 2, the IRA shot and killed a British Army major in
Dortmund, West Germany.
   ``We must concentrate on trying to prevent such attacks. In the
past few weeks, we have succeeded in preventing a number of further
attacks planned by the IRA,'' Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble
told European Community justice and interior ministers. They were
in Dublin for a two-day meeting.
   Schauble refused to give details of the foiled attacks, but he
said improved cooperation between police forces on the European
continent that had curbed the IRA's activities.
   ``I am sure and convinced that the leeway for the IRA on the
Continent is getting smaller and the search pressure which emanates
not only from the Germans but also from our neighboring countries,
Belgium and the Netherlands, is very high,'' he said. ``The fact
that we have succeeded in preventing a number of attacks in recent
weeks shows that our cooperation is working.''
   The 12-nation European Community ministers has passed a
terrorism prevention plan that includes ``hot pursuit'' across
borders, a central computer for collecting intelligence and
improved security at airports, train stations and ferry ports.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic. Many of its attacks
are in Northern Ireland and Britain, but it has often attacked
British targets in Western Europe as well.
   In Friday's announcement, the IRA also claimed responsibility
for a bomb at a mansion in rural England that belonged to Lord
McAlpin, formerly a leading member of the governing Conservative
Party. No one was hurt in that blast on Tuesday.
   At Friday's meeting of the so-called Trevi Group, the European
ministers also agreed set up a central drug intelligence unit in
Europe to fight international trafficking.
   The Trevi group was created in Luxembourg in 1976 to coordinate
security efforts in the European Community.

   Tears, prayers and stories of homes and
families swept away were offered Friday by residents who saw flash
floods gush from hilly coal fields and sweep through their village.
   ``I just couldn't get to them. I hollered as loud as I could,''
said Herman Adams, who wept as he recounted seeing the trailer home
containing his daughter and two grandchildren carried off by the
surging Pipe Creek on Thursday night. ``It happened so fast.''
   At a disaster center set up in this Belmont County village in
the eastern part of the state, Adams waited Friday with others for
word about the fate of missing relatives.
   About 200 people came and went during the day from the center,
located at Jefferson School, seeking news of missing friends and
relatives.
   Trailer homes appeared to be hit hardest when water surged from
the Belmont County highlands down the Wegee and Pipe creeks past
Shadyside and into the Ohio River, said Jim Williams, chief of
staff of the Emergency Management Agency.
   ``Any mobile home in the path of the water is gone,'' said Mead
Township Trustee Gregg Warren. The two creeks in Mead Township were
turned into raging rivers after 5.5 inches of rain fell there in
less than 3{ hours.
   ``It's hard to explain. It's unbelievable. A creek you could
walk across with water up to your ankles in some places rose 15 to
25 feet,'' said Gregg Warren, a Mead Township trustee.
   Adams said he had eaten dinner with his daughter, Sue, and her
two children at their trailer home Thursday night and returned to
his house about 200 feet away when he heard the sound of rushing
water.
   ```What the heck is that,' I thought. I have a window facing the
creek. I looked out and saw the water'' about 3 feet high.
   ``The water was all around the trailer. I hollered and hollered.
They couldn't hear me. The water was too high. I couldn't get to
them.
   ``And then they were gone,'' Adams said. He lowered his head and
wept.
   A neighbor, Becky Glaser, said Adams' wife had died recently.
She put an arm around Adams and comforted him.
   ``I lost everything, too,'' Mrs. Glaser said. ``I'm wiped out
but my family, I have three children, are fine. Thank God. ... I
just stood there and watched my car and his car getting washed
away.''
   A dozen mattresses were spread across the floor of the Jefferson
School. People huddled together in small groups.
   Tina Street said she had been sent to the school to identify
some bodies, but saw none there.
   ``I saw them pull Debbie, my sister-in-law, out of the water
this morning about 7. She and my brother, Bart Graham, and their
child disappeared last night. They haven't found Bart or the child
yet,'' Ms. Street said.
   Because she lives on a hill, Ms. Street said, her house was
spared.
   ``But I saw whole houses go. Cars and trucks were floating away
and the creek took out a bridge. The water took everything in its
path.''

<HEAD>Serbian Journalists Complain of Bias in Belgrade TV News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent journalists' groups in
Serbia complained Friday of bias in Belgrade TV coverage of an
anti-communist rally and demanded criminal charges be brought
against the communist director.
   ``We consider that television reports before, during and after
the opposition rally ... represent a drastic violation of
journalistic ethics,'' said a statement released by Belgrade
Television's independent employees union.
   More than 30,000 people from the one-party state of Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, demonstrated in Belgrade on
Wednesday demanding free elections and an end to Communist rule in
their state.
   The main rally ended peacefully, but police later used clubs to
disperse demonstrators who went to the TV station to demand
coverage of their demands and the resignation of Dusan Mitevic, a
communist official appointed to head the state-run TV last year.
   Belgrade TV and Serbia's state-run press have described the
rally as ``a betrayal of Serbia'' and its participants as ``fascist
hooligans.'' They demand a purge of reporters from Belgrade's
independent radio station, which gave comprehensive coverage to the
event.
   A similar protest about coverage was made against the newspaper
Politika, an outlet of Serbia's ruling Communists, by 37 Politika
reporters. Its story Thursday on the rally was headlined, ``The
Anti-Serbian Gathering Was Unsuccessful.''
   The Politika reporters said ``the course of democratization
cannot be stopped by police batons ... or one-sided reporting.''
They said prominent public figures, including authors and
university professors, were among about 100 people beaten in front
of the station and this could not be kept secret.
   Several TV news announcers refused to report what the
journalists' union termed ``propaganda fabrications'' and later
were fined and suspended, according to the statement carried by the
national Tanjug news agency.
   Serbia is the only Yugoslav republic that has not held or
scheduled free elections for local legislatures.
   The state's Communist authorities reject Western-style democracy
and say elections will not be held before the lengthy process of
adopting a new constitution is completed.
   Serbia's state-run media said 7,000 people ``and curious
onlookers'' participated in the rally. Independent reports said
30,000 to 50,000 people attended.

<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact admitted past errors,
including the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Soviets'
crushing of the Hungarian uprising 12 years earlier, East Germany's
defense minister said Friday.
   After a three-day Warsaw Pact meeting outside East Berlin, the
Soviet commander of the group's military forces acknowledged
dissent within the ranks of the once rock-solid alliance.
   With last year's pro-democracy revolutions in Eastern Europe,
the seven-nation Warsaw Pact has been facing increasing pressures
from within. East German Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann has even
predicted the breakup of the pact's military structures by the end
of this year.
   ``The defense ministers for the first time clearly discussed the
past errors of the Warsaw Pact,'' Eppelmann told a news conference
following the meeting in the suburb of Strausberg.
   Eppelmann specifically mentioned as examples the Warsaw Pact
invasion to put down the Prague Spring revolution by reform
Communists in 1968, and the Soviets' repression of an
anti-Communist revolt in Hungary in 1956.
   ``The situation has changed so much that relics from the
division of the continent must be overcome,'' Eppelmann told
reporters. He did not say in what form the Pact admitted the errors.
   However, Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek of Czechoslovakia said
earlier his colleagues ``apologized to a certain extent'' for the
military intervention 22 years ago.
   Speaking about this week's meeting, the Soviet commander of
Warsaw Pact forces said there were ``differences of opinion
regarding the prospects of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Gen. P.G. Lushev also acknowledged differences on the
``development of the function and character'' of the pact, but he
appealed to Moscow's allies to continue fulfilling their
obligations.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia have already received promises of
large pullouts of Soviet troops from their nations.
   ``As long as there is a Western alliance, there will be a Warsaw
Pact,'' Lushev said. The military alliance was founded in 1955. It
has been a counterbalance to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the Western alliance, during the Cold War.
   The coming unification of the two Germanys was one of the
dominant questions at the defense ministers' meeting.
   Eppelmann, the East German defense chief, said he was suggesting
Sept. 1, 1992, as the date for full unification. That date is far
later than the general timeframe envisioned by West German
officials.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Ion Iliescu on Friday
ordered home thousands of club-wielding coal miners after thanking
them ``with all my heart'' for helping hunt down anti-government
demonstrators.
   Iliescu's inauguration, scheduled for Friday, was postponed
following three days of rioting, arson and mayhem in this capital
of 2.2 million residents.
   Random attacks by the miners terrorized Bucharest in the
country's worst violence since the December revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Many miners were seen leaving
Friday.
   State radio said at 10 p.m. the situation in Bucharest ``is
beginning to normalize.''
   At a news conference, Premier Petre Roman acknowledged the
government held little sway over the mob of miners who
indiscriminately attacked passers-by in the capital, beat
journalists and ransacked opposition party headquarters.
   In Washington, a Bush administration official said
non-humaritarian aid to Romania will be withheld to protest the
violence.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said aid programs
being considered would be held up ``until the democratic process
has been restored.'' He said $80 million in food aid and $1 million
in medical aid would not be affected.
   Miners trashed the home of Ion Ratiu, chief of the opposition
National Peasant Party, who called the violence a ``death of
democracy.''
   ``(It's) the rule of the mob, no respect for human rights. The
forces of law and order stand by instead of maintaining law and
order,'' he said.
   Ratiu said he was briefly detained Thursday night and his
colleagues were beaten by miners.
   Police and army units normally charged with law enforcement had
watched without intervening as miners, loyal to Iliescu, assaulted
scores of people.
   Roman said the pit workers had been asked only to peacefully
occupy University Square, and that the government deplored all
subsequent violence.
   Wednesday's police crackdown on a 53-day protest in the central
square set off riots in which demonstrators threw firebombs at
police headquarters and the Interior Ministry and overturned
vehicles. Soldiers fired on the rioters.
   The miners _ whose benefits greatly increased following the
revolution _ streamed into the capital early Thursday after Iliescu
pleaded for help to put down what he called a ``fascist'' revolt.
   At least five people died, and figures published Friday by the
state news agency Rompres said 367 people were injured, with 112
still hospitalized.
   The demonstrators say the government _ led by Iliescu and his
National Salvation Front and elected overwhelmingly in free
elections on May 20 _ is dominated by former Communists who they
say continue Ceausescu's repressive policies.
   The demonstrators want former Communist leaders, including
Iliescu, banned from holding public office for 10 years.
   On Friday, Iliescu told cheering miners at the National
Exhibition hall in northern Bucharest, ``You are a strong force
with much civic discipline, people you can trust in good times and
bad.'' State television broadcast part of the meeting, in which he
thanked them ``with all my heart.''
   Later, authorities began putting miners on buses for the city's
northern railroad station. They were to return on special trains to
their homes in the Jiu valley mining region of western Romania,
Rompres said.
   It said Iliescu met miners' leaders Friday and ordered them to
leave the capital. Tens of thousands were reported to have come to
Bucharest.
   Several packed buses inexplicably turned back into the city
core, stopped and disgorged hundreds of miners.
   On Boulevard Magheru, the central street leading from University
Square, scores of marauding miners lashed out at random with wooden
clubs at shoppers and kicked at a fallen man. Others chased foreign
journalists into the nearby Intercontinental Hotel.
   Romanians watching from balconies whistled in derision and
shouted anti-government slogans. Pedestrians jeered as they fled
the miners.
   Doormen and other hotel personnel strained to keep the main
glass doors shut as hundreds of soot-stained miners pushed trying
to get in. An assistant hotel manager pleaded with a TV crew to
stop filming the action from a 10th- floor balcony, saying the mob
was dangerous.
   But by Friday evening, University Square was clear of miners and
journalists saw none on the drive from the square to the train
station. Police and soldiers with submachine guns told people in
the square not to form crowds.
   Iliescu was to have been sworn in Friday at a meeting of both
houses of Parliament. But a woman answering the phone at his
office, who refused to give her name, said the session was put off
until Monday.
   The French TV network La Cinq said it protested to Romanian
authorities that miners and security forces beat two of its
journalists and damaged their equipment.
   La Cinq broadcast an interview by Laszlo Toekes, the ethnic
Hungarian pastor whose threatened arrest in Timisoara, western
Romania, touched off December's revolution that culminated in the
Dec. 25 execution of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena.
   ``I condemn without equivocation all the traitors of this new
regime and its leader, Iliescu, who can be considered as a direct
continuation of Ceausescu,'' Toekes said. ``I think we will have to
have a second revolution.''
   The miners devastated opposition party headquarters on Thursday,
beating or threatening party leaders and damaging their homes.
Miners invaded the offices of Romania Libera, Romania's largest
independent newspaper with a circulation of more than 800,000, and
a frequent critic of the government.
   Romania Libera journalist Mirela Roznoveanu said the miners beat
a co-worker. The paper did not appear Friday. Printers and
distributors loyal to Iliescu refused to handle it.
   Roman expressed regret over the attack, telling reporters
criticism of government was healthy.
   Rompres quoted an unidentified spokesman for the miners as
saying nobody invited them to come to Bucharest. But city buses and
army trucks transported them by the hundreds to key points in the
city.
   Rompres reported that Marian Munteanu, head of the anti-Iliescu
Students' Alliance, was hospitalized with injuries. Miners were
heard boasting they had beaten Munteanu.
   Among opposition party headquarters trashed were those of the
21st of December Organization of students who fought against
Ceausescu.

   Western leaders on Friday threatened to block
economic pacts with Romania following a harsh crackdown on
anti-government demonstrators.
   Many leaders decried the crackdown as a return to repressive
tactics used by ousted Communists.
   Coal miners using clubs were recruited to help police put down
pro-democracy protests in the Romanian capital of Bucharest. At
least five people were killed and 367 injured in the worst violence
since the December revolution that toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The demonstrators claimed the freely elected government led by
President-elect Ion Iliescu is dominated by former Communists.
   ``I am not saying they should not restore a decent degree of
order,'' said British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave.
``What I am saying is that the way they are responding, the
rhetoric they are using and the calling out of the old
`rent-a-mob,' just as Ceausescu used to do, are signs that fill us
with despondency.''
   The European Community, which hailed the fall of Ceausescu, will
hold up a trade and economic cooperation accord finalized this
week, said Bruce Millan, a member of the community's executive
commission in Brussels.
   ``I can give an absolute assurance that we will not proceed with
that ratification procedure in the kind of circumstances that face
us in Romania at the moment,'' Millan said in Strasbourg, France,
in an address to the EC Parliament.
   Other EC officials said there has been no final decision on
suspending the accord. The 12-nation group will consider the pact
Monday.
   Millan also hinted that Romania may lose aid from a more than $2
billion fund created to assist former communist countries.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
non-humanitarian aid programs to Romania would be help up ``until
the democratic process has been restored.'' He said $80 million in
food aid and $1 million in medical aid would not be affected.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
Romania was trying to change from an ``authoritarian regime to a
state of the rule of law.''
   ``There is no smooth road to that,'' he said.
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a communique
expressing anxiety over events in neighboring Romania.
   ``Resort to violence, the use of brutal methods so familiar from
before, arrogance and organized aggression against political
opposition is irreconcilable with European norms,'' the communique
said.
   France, which claimed four embassy staff members in Bucharest
were attacked during the crackdown, lodged a strong protest with
the Romanian charge d'affaires, Sabin Pop, in Paris.
   The governing Socialist Party in France accused Iliescu of
``methods of repression ... which evoke the worst practices of
Stalinism.''
   The British Foreign Office summoned Romania's senior envoy in
London, Nicu Bujor, and warned that Britain will find it difficult
to give aid.
   British officials also protested about the storming of the home
of opposition leader Ion Ratiu, head of the Romanian National
Peasant Party, who is in exile in Britain.
   The 23-nation Council of Europe said Romania was regressing
politically.
   ``It is not by this route Romania will rejoin the Europe of
human rights and freedoms,'' said the council's secretary-general,
Catherine Lalumiere.
   Protests were also issued by several Western countries,
including Austria, Italy, Spain and Sweden.
   Japan, in a statement by the Foreign Ministry, accused the
Romanian authorities of an ``escessive use of power.''
   Exiled King Michael of Romania said Iliescu was moving to
restore a communist dictatorship, and urged the West to withhold
aid.
   ``I am profoundly disgusted to see where and how low these
people are leading my country,'' he said in Geneva. ``Anything that
is not a Communist is a fascist. It's the same old story.''
   A statement by several labor groups, including the International
Miners' Federation, said they ``strongly condemn the (Romanian)
government's action aimed at using the work force in repressive
action.''

<HEAD>Miriam Makeba Sees Change in South Africa After 31 Years of Exile</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Singer Miriam Makeba said
Friday she has seen many changes in her home country after being
exiled for 31 years, but ``apartheid is still alive.''
   ``I can come home but I cannot vote,'' she told a news
conference after a one-week visit to see her family and pray at her
mother's grave.
   The 58-year-old singer mentioned that laws are still intact
restricting black ownership of land and segregating education and
residential areas.
   ``My impressions are that there are some cosmetic changes. I see
we are all sitting here together without police coming to say,
`What are you doing?' That is something,'' she said.
   She indicated some disagreement with the African National
Congress and other people about whether she would be breaking the
organization's boycott on entertainers performing in South Africa
if she sang in public at home.
   Ms. Makeba said, ``I believe as a South African the cultural
boycott does not apply to me. It depends on the comrades of the
(ANC) cultural desk. There is some kind of confusion.''
   She said she does not know if she will live in South Africa
permanently, but she wants to return and perform, and bring her
children and grandchildren.
   ``It would be a shame for me to die tomorrow before I come back
to sing before you, because that is something I look forward to the
most, to come back and sing before the South African people, where
I do not have to translate my songs,'' she said.
   Ms. Makeba has long supported the ANC. Her songs were banned in
South Africa in 1962 when she spoke in favor of the organization at
the United Nations.
   Ms. Makeba sang one song extemporaneously and without
accompaniment when called to the stage at a Johannesburg nightclub
this week.
   She said visiting her mother's grave was her only program. She
left South Africa in 1959 at the age of 27 to make a movie musical
and appear on television in the United States, but received a
one-year contract to sing at the Village Vanguard in New York.
   When her mother died in 1960, the year the African National
Congress was outlawed, Ms. Makeba was denied permission to return
home and attend the funeral.
   After landing in Johannesburg on a flight from her home in
Brussels, Belgium last Sunday, Ms. Makeba went immediately to her
mother's grave in Soweto.
   ``I tried to make a prayer. I just choked, and all I did was
weep,'' she said.
   ``I sat on my mother's grave ... and I cried like a baby. And I
was happy, because we believe that wherever they are, a mother sees
what we do. They listen to what we say. And I just consoled myself
that wherever her soul is, she now knows that her baby is here, and
she came to say, `Mama, I am back.'''

   Greenpeace environmental activists in
inflatable boats stuck radiation symbols on the hull of the British
aircraft carrier Ark Royal on Friday to protest nuclear weapons.
   Authorities arrested five protesters on charges of mischief and
failure to comply.
   The carrier arrived Friday in Halifax, on the Atlantic coast of
Nova Scotia.
   The protesters buzzed the British vessel in seven small boats.
They attached some radiation symbols to the boat and painted on
others.
   Six of them climbed to the top of a two-lane bridge spanning
Halifax harbor where they unfurled a banner that asked Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney to ``just say `no' to nuclear warships.''
   Greenpeace, which advocates nuclear disarmament, says the
British ship carries nuclear weapons. They have organized a series
of such protests this year against British and U.S. naval vessels.

<HEAD>Bus Passenger Sits in for Replacement Greyhound Driver Unable to

   A bus passenger took the wheel Friday after a
replacement driver for strike-plagued Greyhound told riders he
didn't know how to use a stick shift.
   Greyhound officials said Diane Monteiro, a licensed bus driver
for another company, drove the bus from Delaware to New York City
while the ill-trained replacement sat back and left the driving to
her.
   The replacement driver started at a junction in State Road,
Del., and ``it was obvious very quickly that he could not drive
that bus,'' said Greyhound spokesman George Grazley.
   Trained by Greyhound, the driver was operating a Carolina
Coaches bus under an arrangement with Greyhound, which also owns
Trailways.
   ``When he started to pull off, it sounded like he had clutch
trouble,'' said passenger Rosa White. ``Then we get down the
highway and we get to the big trucks. He almost ran us into one of
those. He was swerving.
   ``And he made an announcement that (the company) hadn't trained
him to shift the gears and he didn't know how to drive the bus.''
   Ms. Monteiro took the wheel, calmed passengers and the
replacement driver ``just got in a seat and went on and relaxed
instead of watching what she was doing,'' Ms. White said.
   ``We don't know how the guy got through the training school
without knowing all of that,'' Grazley said, adding that the driver
was promptly fired.
   He refused to identify the driver.
   ``Greyhound seems to have adopted a new slogan. It's called, `Go
Greyhound and leave the driving to you,''' said Harold Mandlowitz,
president of Local 1202 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has
been on strike against the nation's only intercity bus company
since March.
   The woman made a stop at a Greyhound terminal in Newark, N.J.,
and continued to New York, where the bus arrived between 7 a.m. and
8 a.m., Ms. White said.
   Efforts by The Associated Press to contact Ms. Monteiro for
comment were not immediately successful. The bus company she works
for was not disclosed.
   Grazley said Dallas-based Greyhound is investigating.
   ``We're going to find out how he got through school,'' Grazley
said. ``The fact that he got through school without learning how to
drive a stick shift doesn't mean that others did. We have not had
other mistakes like this.''
   The 6,300 drivers in the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions launched their strike on March 2 over wages and job
security. Greyhound filed for bankruptcy protection last week.
   The company has been operating with about 3,000 replacement
drivers.

   Law officials say they have no action planned for
2 Live Crew's concert Friday, but the controversial rap group still
submitted its profanity-laced lyrics to the state's attonrey's
office for approval.
   Cecil Partee, an attorney with Cook County State's Attorney's
Office, reviewed the lyrics and ``finds them personally
offensive,'' said spokesman Dan McCullough.
   ``But he has stated ... that he will not take any action himself
to prevent the concert from happening or to otherwise intervene
unless the Chicago police make an arrest,'' McCullough said.
   Police said they had no plans regarding the concert, since the
state's attorney's office has historically made the determination
on what is and isn't obscene.
   ``We're not going to deviate from that,'' said spokeswoman Tina
Vicini.
   In Huntsville, Ala., 2 Live Crew's scheduled Saturday night
performance was canceled by civic center officials who said the
concert promoter didn't obtain proper insurance for the show.
   Contracts by the Von Braun Civic Center require promoters to
have liability insurance coverage by a company licensed in Alabama.
2 Live Crew's promoter has an insurance carrier licensed in another
state, civil center officials said Friday.
   Luther Campbell and another member of the Miami-based group were
arrested in Florida last weekend after they played songs from their
sexually explicit ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album at an
all-adult show. A Florida record store owner who sold the album
also was arrested.
   The arrests followed a federal judge's ruling that the album
violates Florida's obscenity law. The ruling is being appealed.
   Friday's concert was scheduled for the the International
Amphitheatre, The former home of the stormy 1968 Democratic
National Convention. The Amphitheater's general manager said he
expected a crowd of about 6,000 for the 10,000-seat arena.
   ``The last couple of days, sales have picked up,'' said Michael
Balog, general manager of the theater.
   He said 2 Live Crew has performed twice there in the last eight
months with no media attention, and added that the amphitheater's
audience was urban and more sophisticated than the southern locales
where the band has run into problems.
   ``Kids who come to the show know the lyrics and know what to
expect,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago-based civil rights organization Operation
PUSH was offering a ``clean'' alternative to Friday's 2 Live Crew
performance with a speech and performance by rapper Kool Moe-Dee.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $7.6 Million to Widow of Prison Writer's Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded nearly $7.6 million Friday to the
widow of a young actor stabbed to death by prison writer and Norman
Mailer protege Jack Henry Abbott.
   Abbott, who wrote the best-seller ``In the Belly of the Beast,''
acted as his own attorney in the wrongful death civil trial.
   The suit was filed by Ricci Adan, 32. Abbott is serving a
15-year-to-life prison term for killing her husband, Richard Adan,
22, outside a Manhattan restaurant where he worked in 1981.
   Abbott, 46, killed the actor-waiter with a single stab wound to
the heart. In his sometimes sneering testimony, Abbott claimed that
Adan didn't suffer because his death was sudden. The jury found
otherwise.
   It awarded Mrs. Adan $5.575 million in compensatory damages for
lost income, and $2 million for her husband's pain and suffering
before his death.
   About $100,000 Abbott earned from his book remains frozen in an
escrow account set up in case he lost the suit. Another $15,000,
also earned from his writings, is being held by the state Crime
Victims Board.
   Outside the courtroom, Mrs. Adan and her family whooped, shouted
and hugged each other to celebrate.
   Abbott asked presiding Justice Carol Arber. ``This is a little
excessive, your honor, wouldn't you say?''
   The judge told Abbott he could appeal, but he did not say
whether he would.
   ``In the Belly of the Beast'' was composed of prison letters
Abbott sent to Mailer from 1978 through 1981.
   During those years, Abbott was imprisoned first for bank robbery
and then for fatally stabbing another inmate. Mailer supported
Abbott's parole, largely because of his writing talent. Abbot
killed Adan six weeks after leaving prison.
   Mailer has been unavailable for comment on Abbott's latest court
drama.
   Mrs. Adan said the judgment ended years of pain.
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' she said. ``He's not just a speck of
dust anymore. He's not just a victim, or a piece of paper _ he's a
human being. And he can rest now.''
   Abbott disputed an expert who said the fledgling actor could
have earned $17 million by age 65.
   Abbott said those calculations assumed Adan ``would have been a
movie star of the caliber of Paul Newman.'
   Kenneth Fishman, one of Mrs. Adan's attorneys, was unimpressed
by Abbott's legal talents, saying he would have flunked him in a
law school class.
   ``He had a certain feel for the courtroom, having spent so much
time in so many of them,'' Fishman said, ``but he always had his
ego in the way.''
   Fishman noted that Abbott asked every witness, every juror, the
judge and virtually every other person he spoke to whether they had
read his book.
   Naomi Zack, the State University of New York philosophy
instructor Abbott married last September while in prison, was not
in court for the verdict. She had been present almost every day
during the two-week trial and was the only witness Abbott called.

<HEAD>Poland Calls Out Troops to Open Highway Blocked by Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WISNIEWO, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led government Friday
sent police with clubs and tear gas to open a highway blocked by
farmers angry about a drop in milk prices.
   The farmers left in the face of the show of force, agreeing to
suspend their protest at least until discussions with Solidarity
Chairman Lech Walesa. He was expected to arrive Saturday.
   Protesters moved aside tractors blocking the two-lane highway at
Wisniewo, a rural community 80 miles northwest of Warsaw. The
highway is the main road between Warsaw and the northern port of
Gdansk.
   The blockade of highway E-7 began late Tuesday after farmers
learned the local dairy cooperative was reducing the price it would
pay for milk to 2 cents a quart.
   Walesa was caught in their blockade Thursday when he was being
driven from his home in Gdansk to Warsaw for a flight to a meeting
of the International Labor Organization in Switzerland.
   The labor leader told the farmers their dispute was local, but
he said it was ``justified.'' He pledged to come back to help them
resolve it if necessary.
   The government stuck to its vow not to make special concessions
that would deviate from the economic reform program designed to
transform the socialist economy into a market-driven system.
   It refused to bargain with railway workers during their strike
in May, but Walesa negotiated a return to work that was followed by
a pay increase.
   Because the road blocked by the farmers is considered an
international highway, the government announced Friday that it was
obliged under agreements with other countries to keep it open. It
told the farmers that it would resort to force if necessary.
   Traffic was being diverted to other highways and several columns
of police vehicles, carrying officers armed with truncheons and
tear gas, arrived in Wisniewo at dusk. Some officers were in
armored vehicles, and some came with water cannons.
   ``It will be a second Romania,'' some townspeople called out
when three helicopters suddenly appeared over their village. It was
a reference to the bloody Romanian revolution in December.
   Hundreds of local residents sympathetic to the farmers milled
around the streets late Friday.
   However, the police vehicles parked along the side of the road,
and there was no confrontation.
   Andrzej Wojtkowski, a local resident, said farmers had been
complaining for months but only got the attention of authorities
when they blocked the road.
   ``It's not a local problem. It is a problem for the
government,'' he said.
   He said the local dairy would not be in such trouble if not for
the high interest rates imposed by the government in January to
combat inflation.
   According to Wojtkowski, the dairy has reduced the price it will
pay for milk by more than half since April, and farmers have no
other potential buyer in the area.
   Farmers on Friday donated their milk free to hospitals and
apartment buildings but refused to sell it to the dairy.

   Trillions of hungry microbes ate their
way through an oil slick Friday as officials counted on an
experimental method to help with the cleanup from the wrecked
Norwegian tanker Mega Borg.
   ``This is breakthrough technology,'' Texas Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro said of the process called bioremediation.
   Rolling in open seas aboard a 41-foot Coast Guard boat,
officials sprayed a square acre in the Gulf of Mexico that was
intermittently laced and blanketed by oil.
   Bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria that have been
bred as super-eaters to break down oil into harmless fatty acids
that later are eaten by marine life, said Carl Oppenheimer, who
developed the process.
   Oppenheimer, a University of Texas microbiologist who has been
working on the process for 15 years, predicted success. Within one
or two days, there will be a clear square acre in the middle of the
slick, he said.
   ``I think it is going to open the door now to bioremediation on
a much wider scale,'' he said.
   Skeptics have criticized Oppenheimer's work, Mauro said, because
the concept is so simple.
   Oppenheimer would only say of the experiment, ``It's been a long
time coming.''
   He said some tests have been performed on controlled spills in
inner harbor areas but never on the open sea.
   Bioremediation was applied last month for the Exxon Valdez spill
in Alaska. Microbes were used to clean some rocks on the shore of
the Prince William Sound. Officials here allowed a test on the
slick from the Norwegian supertanker that exploded June 8.
   ``We need bioremediation,'' said Texas Water Commission Chairman
B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne III. ``This is a man who had an idea and no one
would listen. He hasn't been able to get through all the snake oil
salesmen.''
   Oppenheimer said crews would return later to retrieve samples of
the water that was treated with the microbes. He said there would
approximately 5.3 billion microbes per square centimeter.
   About 100 pounds of the sand-like substance was mixed with sea
water and sprayed onto the slick.
   Oppenheimer said the slick, about three miles southeast of the
Mega Borg, probably was about one-eighth of an inch thick. Markers
were set to track the movement of the area that was treated.
   He said he believed the process could remove about 90 percent of
the oil, compared with the 5 or 10 percent he said skimmers could
remove. Oppenheimer described skimmers as ``mostly cosmetic.''

   An 11-state sweep targeting street gangs that
export drug dealing from California ghettos to other states netted
more than 170 arrests, authorities said Friday.
   The action dubbed operation Street Sweep began Thursday, with
hundreds of federal agents and local law officers moving in on
members of the Crips and Bloods, violent gangs spawned in poor
Southern California neighborhoods.
   By late afternoon Friday, 174 arrests had been made, officials
said.
   ``What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a
national one,'' said Stephen E. Higgins, director of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Arrests were made in California, Louisiana, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, and two other states
that weren't identified because warrants were still being served.
   Authorities at a news conference to announce the sweep displayed
a sample of confiscated weapons, but did not detail the quantity of
weapons or drugs seized.
   A national investigation by the bureau revealed the rival Crips
and Bloods were heavily involved in crack cocaine distribution and
firearms trafficking nationwide, Higgins said.
   ``Gang members are involved in murders, drive-by shootings,
narcotics trafficking, assaults, credit car fraud, robberies and
money laundering,'' he said, adding the operation was ``intended to
send a message to violent street gangs.''
   More arrests were expected through the weekend, ATF spokesman
Jack Killorian said from Washington, D.C.
   ``This was not a search and investigative operation. It was an
arrest operation,'' Killorian said. ``Most of the arrests were
fugitives and the majority were charged with federal weapons
charges.''
   The sweep focused on Southern California, where 134 arrests were
made in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San
Diego counties.
   Arrests in Louisiana were related to a January seizure in
Shreveport of nearly 13 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated
$250,000, Killorian said.
   Higgins was unable to say if those arrested were gang leaders.
   ``They aren't formally structured in that sense, (but) these are
people who control a fair amount of the (drug) market,'' he said.
   Although outnumbered by drug traffickers, law enforcement
officers' efforts to eradicate drug dealing could prevail, he said
   ``I'm convinced it's a winnable war,'' Higgins said. ``We're in
it for the long term.''

   Pope John Paul II on Friday greeted South
African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela and blessed his
efforts to destroy the system of racial segregation.
   But the pontiff did not directly answer Mandela's request to
support economic sanctions to keep pressure on South Africa's white
leaders.
   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the Vatican considers
sanctions a political issue but that apartheid was an ethical
problem that is proper for the pope to address.
   John Paul received Mandela in a 25-minute audience, part of the
African National Congress deputy president's six-week tour of
Europe, Africa and North America.
   As reporters were let into the pope's private library at the end
of the talks, John Paul told Mandela, freed Feb. 11 after more than
27 years in prison, ``Thanks be to God that we can meet.''
   The pope in the past has praised Mandela as a ``man who suffers
for the rights of his people'' and the Vatican last year issued a
major document on racism harshly condemning apartheid.
   Turning to reporters, Mandela explained that the ANC believes
sanctions need to be maintained and ``I asked them (the Holy See)
to express themselves very clearly on this issue.
   ``I asked our father (the pope) to bless this initiative because
we are sure his blessing would help because his stands on issues
like apartheid and anti-Semitism have been so clear they have won
respect from the whole world.''
   John Paul then said in English: ``God bless your initiatives.''
   In a later news conference, Mandela said the pope indicated
Vatican officials ``were putting moral pressure to induce the South
African government to abandon apartheid.''
   He added that John Paul had not asked the ANC to give up armed
struggle.
   ``If an oppressor uses force and brutality in addressing the
legitimate aspirations of the people, the people are entitled in a
defensive manner to adopt or resort to violence too,'' he said. He
added that the pontiff ``apparently understands the position better
than some of you (journalists) do.''
   In a statement issued after the meeting, the Vatican said the
audience granted to Mandela was ``further confirmation of the Holy
See's commitment in favor of a peaceful political evolution in
South Africa'' and the ``progressive overcoming of the system of
apartheid.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy.
   Mandela said he was ``very encouraged'' by his talks Friday
afternoon with Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat.
Mandela asked Italy for financial and material support for the ANC
as it reorganizes, a spokesman for the premier said.
   At the news conference, Mandela made one of his harshest attacks
on black leaders Lucas Mangope, the head of the nominally
independent homeland of Bophuthatswana, and Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
the head of Inkatha, a Zulu-based conservative political
organization that opposes sanctions.
   Asked why they had not been included in negotiations between the
government and the ANC, Mandela said Mangope had been kept in power
by white authorities. ``I don't think that he is any factor at all
in what is going on in South Africa today,'' Mandela said.
   He said Buthelezi agreed ``to work with the government on
projects which we do not believe are in the interests of the black
people.''
   Later Friday, Mandela flew to the Netherlands for a two-day
visit that was seen as recognition of that nation's opposition to
apartheid. He and his wife, Winnie, arrived on an Italian Air Force
jet at a Dutch navy air base outside The Hague.
   His visit will include a breakfast meeting Saturday with Dutch
leaders, including Premier Ruud Lubbers. Mandela is also expected
to meet Queen Beatrix at her palace, an unusual honor for
non-governmental visitors.

<HEAD>Justice Sides With FCC: Dump `Fin-Syn' Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Thursday sided with
the major television networks in their fight to regain the right to
own or be able to sell their programs in the lucrative rerun market.
   The department said it supported a 1983 conclusion by the
Federal Communications Commission that allowing TV networks to have
a financial interest and syndication rights in the programs they
broadcast would not hurt competition.
   ``It appears that, in purchasing television entertainment
programs, the networks compete not only with each other, but also,
increasingly, with other purchasers of television entertainment
programs,'' the department said in a filing with the commission.
   It urged the commission ``to eliminate the financial interest
and syndication rules unless the record demonstrates that they are
necessary to protect the public interest in competition.''
   The FCC in March said it would reconsider 1970 rules that
prohibit ABC, CBS and NBC from having an interest in their programs
or selling them in syndication.
   The FCC had postponed beginning its inquiry until Thursday to
give the interested parties one last chance to work out an
agreement to alter the rules, known as ``fin-syn.'' Producers and
the networks have been engaged in often-acrimonious talks to change
the rules ever since 1983.
   The talks failed this week again, and the commission began
accepting comments Thursday.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, who has said he wants some changes in
the rules, said he was disappointed but not surprised that the
parties did not reach agreement.
   The FCC earlier this year granted Fox Broadcasting Co. a waiver
from the fin-syn rules so it could continue to grow into a true
network. Fox also is a syndicator and it is owned by a major
Hollywood producer, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
   Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller on Thursday, in a statement in
Los Angeles, said there was an ``urgent need to review the rules
and to revise the definition of a network.'' He said the FCC should
be encouraging companies such as Fox.
   In 1983 the FCC tentatively decided to eliminate the financial
interest rule and narrow the syndication rule to prohibit only
network participation in domestic syndication of prime time
programs. But it delayed the proceeding under pressure from
Congress and President Reagan and urged the interested parties to
find a solution themselves.
   In March the FCC officially terminated that inquiry and began
the new one.
   Networks argue that the fin-syn rules give undue market power to
producers and impede the networks' abilities to compete in the
increasingly multinational program marketplace.
   Advocates of the rules claim they have helped small producers
flourish and have led to more diversity in programming.
   The Justice Department told the FCC that ``If the networks do
not have significant market power, it appears that the practices
prohibited by the rules would not, in these circumstances, create
such power.''
   ``It also appears unlikely that the rules significantly
constrain the exercise of any market power that the networks may
possess, but we cannot conclusively rule out that possibility.''
   The department conceded it was possible that removing the rules
``could result in wealth transfers from producers to networks.''
   ``But this would not warrant retaining the rules unless such
transfers would be accompanied by an adverse effect on program
output and thus a decrease in social welfare,'' the department said.
   It said increased competition in the program production market
and efficiencies gained through network ownership of financial
interests and syndication rights would benefit the public.

<TEXT>
   Torrential thunderstorms sent a flash
flood surging through a valley into this Ohio River town, killing
at least 11 people, leaving 51 missing and scores of others
homeless Friday, authorities said.
   Raging floodwaters late Thursday swept homes off foundations and
washed away cars. About 200 people were reported evacuated in
central Ohio.
   ``The valleys are choked with debris,'' Gov. Richard Celeste
told reporters after flying over the hilly Appalachian region in
eastern Ohio. ``A wall of water wiped a path through the area.''
   The governor declared a state of emergency, and dispatched about
50 National Guardsmen to the area.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency declared Belmont County,
which includes Shadyside, and Jefferson and Franklin counties
disaster areas, making federal aid available to residents.
Seventeen counties now have been declared disaster areas because of
flooding or tornadoes since May 29.
   Ten bodies were taken to the Bauknecht Funeral Home in
Shadyside, said Bob Bell, funeral director. One body was taken to
Bellaire City Hospital, he said.
   Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator, also said
there were 11 confirmed dead.
   Earlier, Fire Chief Mark Badia had said 14 adults and two
children were dead. The names of the victims have not been released.
   County Sheriff Tom McCort, who said he was running the recovery
effort, said 51 people in Shadysville and Meade Township, where the
two creeks run south of the village, were missing as of 8:45 p.m.
   The list was compiled through telephone inquiries with
townspeople and relatives and interviews with people evacuated from
the area.
   About 200 people came and went from a Shadyside disaster center
during the day, seeking news of missing friends and relatives.
   Vogt said two bodies were found in the Ohio River and one was
found in a field next to the river after water receded. He said the
rest were found in the creeks, which flow into the river.
   Some of the bodies were taken to a funeral home that set up a
temporary morgue in Shadyside, about 10 miles south of Wheeling,
W.Va.
   Officials from Ohio, West Virginia and the U.S. Coast Guard were
searching the Ohio River for survivors and bodies, and Badia said
National Guardsmen were to continue searching the creeks throughout
the night.
   At least five houses along Wegee Creek were washed away, and two
cars were floating in water in one of the basements. Anything that
was still standing was covered with at least 6 feet of debris such
as trees, appliances and furniture.
   The National Weather Service issued no flood warning before the
disaster, although it did issue a flood watch, said Al Wheeler,
deputy meteorologist in the bureau's Cleveland office.
   Weather service offices in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus and
Pittsburgh showed the storm had diminished over eastern Ohio when
it had actually intensified, Wheeler said.
   Thursday night's thunderstorms caused flash flooding across a
wide area of central and eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia and
western Pennsylvania. The floods closed roads, damaged homes and
forced hundreds of people to evacuate.
   But no place was hit with anything approaching the ferocity of
the flooding in Shadyside.
   About 5.5 inches of rain fell between 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
turning two Ohio River tributaries outside the village of 4,300
people into dangerous torrents.
   About 35 buildings, including a tavern, were damaged along Wegee
Creek, and 50 buildings were hit by a flood along Pipe Creek, four
miles south of Wegee Creek, said Dick Quinlin, Belmont County
emergency services coordinator.
   Part of the tavern was washed away when water caved in the back
wall, said Judy Phillips, a sheriff's department spokeswoman. She
said two patrons were accounted for, but she could offer no
estimate of how many were inside at the time.
   One man was found clinging to a bar stool, said state Sen.
Robert Ney, whose district includes Shadyside.
   ``I've never seen anything of this magnitude. There was no
warning,'' Ney said.
   Rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which
flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River, said Badia.
   ``I don't know how to describe it. ... You've got to see it to
believe it,'' Badia said.
   One resident, Robert Ramsey, said his wife, Rose, was crushed to
death in their house by the water.
   There was no complete accounting of deaths, said Karen Bovek, a
spokeswoman at a Shadyside Fire Department command center set up an
a school.
   ``You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven't
been gotten to yet,'' she said. ``It's a disaster here.''
   There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont,
in Licking County in central Ohio, and in northwestern West
Virginia and western Pennsylvania.
   ``It's a pretty good mess, especially in the northern end of the
county,'' said Clarence Weston, a dispatcher with the Marshall
County Sheriff's Department in Moundsville, W.Va. ``We had 3.5
inches of rain in a two-hour period last night.''
   Most of the problems in West Virginia were confined to road
closures and basement flooding.
   At least 25 people were evacuated during the night in the
Pittsburgh suburb of Etna, where some homes had up to 5 feet of
water in their basements, said borough manager Bill Skertich. They
returned to their homes Friday.
   Landslides were reported in the Pittsburgh area, and many city
streets were closed during the storm.
   The flooding was more serious in Licking County, Ohio. Wayne
Tresemer, the county's Disaster Services director, said water was
standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets in the town of Newark,
and the fire department and other agencies used boats to evacuate
some residents.
   Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County in central
Ohio and 3.75 inches of rain was dumped on Holmes County in
north-central Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   In Jefferson County, just north of Belmont County in the eastern
part of the state, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena,
where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creek
flooding.
   Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night,
according to authorities.

   Crews on Friday began spraying
oil-eating microbes on the slick surrounding the burning
supertanker Mega Borg in the first open-sea release of the bacteria
to clean up a spill.
   The Coast Guard boosted its estimate of the amount of oil
released into the Gulf of Mexico to 4.3 million gallons, making it
the nation's fifth largest spill.
   The fire was extinguished Friday afternoon, but officials said
they would have to wait at least 24 hours for the ship to cool
before removing the remaining oil. The ship could catch fire again,
Coast Guard Ptty Officer Todd Nelson said.
   ``There are no flames, however it's still real hot and if we
walk away from it right now, it may reflash,'' Nelson said.
   The Coast Guard had said the first tar balls from the leaking
Norwegian supertanker could wash ashore late Friday on Bolivar
Peninsula, across the bay from Galveston Island. But county
officials said they had no unusual reports of oil on shore.
   ``We don't anticipate the oil will come before Sunday. We're
prepared,'' said Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews.
   Crews on four fireboats also continued spraying water on the
886-foot ship, which exploded and caught fire late last Friday, 57
miles off Galveston. Gray smoke spewed from the rear section of the
vessel.
   More than two dozen smaller boats used skimming devices to suck
up or corral the rusty brown oil trailing from the tanker. Salvage
crews said they had skimmed 146,389 gallons of oil.
   The Coast Guard said most of the light African crude evaporated
or burned, and less than 22,000 gallons remained in the water.
   The Coast Guard would not elaborate on how it reached the 4.3
million gallon estimate for the spill. The spill earlier had been
estimated at 3 million gallons.
   The worst oil spill in U.S. history was last year when the Exxon
Valdez ran aground, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of heavy
crude on the Prince William Sound in Alaska.
   In the experimental use of the microbes, officials working on a
Coast Guard boat mixed the bacteria with sea water and sprayed it
on a section of the 30-mile-long slick.
   About 100 pounds of microbes were sprayed over an acre in a
procedure that lasted about 30 minutes Friday afternoon. Officials
will check the area Saturday to see if the experiment was
successful.
   The process, known as bioremediation, has never been tried on an
oil spill in open seas, although lab experiments have been
successful, said Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
   Bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous
waste sites, treat sewage and wastewater, extract oil from tight
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the Exxon
Valdez accident, Mauro said.
   At Valdez cleanup sites, workers have been applying nitrogen and
phosphorous fertilizer that promotes growth in the sand of the
naturally occurring bacteria.
   The bacteria eats the oil and reduces it to a fatty substance
that fish can eat. When the oil runs out, the microbes die.
   On shore, Galveston officials kept an eye on the advancing slick.
   ``We have not had any indication of any oil coming ashore,'' Pat
Hallisey, executive director of the Galveston County Beach Park
Board, said Friday. ``We're keeping our fingers crossed.''
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene Maestas said there were some
``streams of oil,'' but the captain of the port ordered skimmers to
collect them.
   The largest sheen of oil extended from the vessel about 10 miles
to the northwest, with two additional patches beginning 10 miles
farther. The slick nearest to land was about 25 miles away.
   Firefighters on the Mega Borg pumped oil from a leaking cargo
tank into another tank to try and cut off the fuel source from the
fire. Previously, firefighting efforts have consisted mostly of
showering water on the vessel.
   ``This could improve the situation,'' Coast Guard Capt. Tom
Greene said. ``We're planning to work on this in conjunction with
putting out the fire.''
   Crews also pumped water from a tank on the left side of the boat
to help stabilize the ship. Its rear section has been awash and
listing slightly to the left.
   In Galveston, a Norwegian maritime panel ended three days of
questioning surviving crew members in hopes of finding what caused
the explosion and blast. They asked third mate Jaipal Singh
Mahlawat to elaborate on a fuel leak discovered in the ship's pump
room six hours before the explosion.
   ``I saw the pump man, he was screwing a coupling back to stop
the oil from leaking,'' Mahlawat said. ``No oil was leaking. He had
already wiped it out.''
   The pump man, Putham Mahamood, testified Thursday through a
translator that he performed ``no measurable repair work'' the day
of the explosion.
   The Mega Borg's chief engineer told the panel Thursday one of
the vessel's pumps was leaking fuel about six hours before the
explosion, and a Norwegian shipping inspector said some other pumps
were overdue for an inspection.
   The hearing panel will send its fact-finding report to the
Norwegian maritime investigative bureau, which will determine if
the ship is seaworthy and if there is any criminal liability.
   Of the 41 people aboard the ship, two crewmen were killed, two
are missing and presumed dead and 17 were injured, none seriously.

   Roger Carstairs is a movie star who once was big
box office. Then they had to team him with a female star to sell
tickets. In his most recent picture, he was forced to share billing
with a horse. And now he's making a movie with a creature from
outer space. Guess who gets more attention?
   Desperation time in Hollywood is the theme of ``Price of Fame,''
Charles Grodin's desperate little comedy that arrived Wednesday at
off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater.
   Grodin also stars as the fading actor, but it's a mistake. He's
too laid-back in the role. Grodin is not neurotic enough playing
the star who compulsively checks the grosses of his latest bomb of
a movie or tries to fend off an inquisitive female magazine
interviewer.
   It's this magazine reporter _ a shrill performance by Lizbeth
Mackay _ who sets the plot in motion. She has been assigned by her
editor, who is also her boyfriend, to do a hatchet piece on Roger.
What she doesn't know is the editor's previous girlfriend was once
stolen away by Roger.
   Things get complicated and a tad improbable when Roger maneuvers
the reporter into bed before the interview is over. Naturally, the
boyfriend shows up in Act 2 before a confusing and bittersweet
final curtain.
   Grodin the playwright softens the ending by having the actor
reconcile with his son, a slightly dopey lad who works on the movie
as a gofer. But even that is unexpected since there was no hint of
a problem between the two for most of the two acts.
   Grodin never lets us see why this movie actor was special. He's
more like an accountant than a big star. Consequently, whatever
happens to him elicits little interest.
   And his jokes about Hollywood are pretty tame, especially from
someone with first-hand knowledge about how the movie business game
is played.
   The slow-moving direction by Gloria Muzio doesn't help. The rest
of the actors, including Jace Alexander as the son and Joseph R.
Sicari as a talkative makeup man, labor mightily to liven things
up. But the overall effect is much energy expended for little
result.
   One interesting footnote to the production: Appearing in a small
role is Jeanne Berlin, Grodin's co-star in the wonderful film,
``The Heartbreak Kid.'' The actress is wasted here, the most
glaring example of another promise left unfulfilled by this
insider's tale of Tinseltown.

<HEAD>Social Democrats Give Qualified ``Yes'' To German Economic Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Social Democrats gave
half-hearted approval Thursday to economic merger with East
Germany, saying they won't fight it but that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
is to blame for any untoward consequences.
   Their action removes the last political obstacle to launching
the economic and monetary union that takes effect July 2. Merging
the currencies and other economic mechanisms will mark a huge step
toward formal German unification.
   The left-of-center Social Democrats made their decision at a
special leadership meeting on Thursday that included Oskar
Lafontaine, the party's nominee for chancellor in West German
elections set for Dec. 2.
   Lafontaine has harshly criticized the treaty between the two
Germanys. But his position deeply divided the Social Democrats and
speculation arose that he might quit his candidacy because of
internal feuding.
   Lafontaine remains popular, however, and has decided to stay in
the race.
   Party leaders agreed Thursday the party should not try to block
the merger treaty, but at the same time they washed their hands of
any responsibility if the merger brings unwelcome results.
   One leader, Norbert Gansel, said the party sees economic merger
as ``unavoidable and necessary'' because of the high expectations
it has produced in East Germany. But he said the party was not
offering an ``uncritical yes.''
   Reading from a leadership statement, Gansel said Kohl's
government will bear sole responsibility if ``dramatic problems''
arise from the economic merger.
   Gansel even left the door open for individual party members to
vote against the merger when the treaty comes up for parliamentary
ratification on June 21 and 22. He said any lawmaker voting against
would not be acting ``outside of solidarity'' with the rest of the
party.
   Experts say up to 2 million East Germans could lose their jobs
as antiquated factories go bust. That could produce unrest in East
Germany.
   Another concern is that West Germans will face hefty tax
increases to pay for rebuilding East Germany's economy. Kohl's
government insists tax increases will not be needed.
   For weeks, the Social Democrats tried to get Kohl's government
to change the treaty to provide more job protection for East
Germans.
   But the party was reluctant to press its objections to the
merger treaty too strongly, lest it anger East Germans eagerly
awaiting the anticipated fruits of economic merger and overhaul of
the battered East German economy.
   The Social Democrats still want to be in a position to reap a
political windfall, however, if Kohl's economic merger plans
produce severely negative effects.

   Renewed factional battles broke out
across Lebanon Thursday as rival forces battled for control of the
Christian enclave and an Israeli-backed militia fought leftists in
the south.
   Two people were wounded in the clash between the leftist Popular
Nasserite Organization and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia in the hills to the east of Sidon, provincial capital of
south Lebanon, police said.
   The Nasserite Organization, a predominantly Sunni Moslem group,
fields the largest militia in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The 3,000-member South Lebanon Army helps patrol the security
zone that Israel declared in south Lebanon in 1985 to guard against
cross-border guerrilla raids.
   Police said no casualties were reported in the mortar, machine
gun and rocket-propelled grenade exchanges between Christian troops
loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and militiamen of Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces.
   The inter-Christian battles in east Beirut and Christian
communities to the north eased off Thursday morning, but tension
remained high in the enclave.
   At least 1,036 people have been killed there and 2,774 wounded
since the fighting broke out Jan. 30. It has been some of the worst
inter-Christian fighting in Lebanon's 15-year civil war, which has
more often pitted Christians against Moslems.
   A truce in the inter-Christian showdown was declared May 17, but
violations have been frequent.

<HEAD>Party Expels Mayor for Suggesting Help for Socialists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VILLEURBAINE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rising conservative politician was
suspended by fellow party members for suggesting an alliance with
the governing Socialists in one district to battle a far-right
candidate.
   The move could be the first step in expelling Grenoble Mayor
Alain Carignon from the Rally for the Republic Party and was seen
by some as symbolizing disarray and weakness in the traditional
right.
   Carignon, 41, a former environmental minister, angered party
leaders by publicly endorsing an alliance with President Francois
Mitterrand's Socialists to oppose a candidate from the far-right
National Front party in a district election runoff Sunday in
Villeurbaine, a suburb of Lyons.
   National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen favors expelling Moslem
immigrants from France and has been accused of anti-Semitism. About
4 million of France's 55 million people are immigrants, many
Africans from former French colonies.
   Although the Republic party does not support the National
Front's platform, it is a bitter rival of the Socialists. Republic
party leaders have urged its supporters to abstain from voting in
Sunday's elections.
   On Sunday, National Front candidate Pierre Vial received 27.3
percent of the vote in Valleurbaine to defeat conservative party
candidates. Vial faces Socialist candidate Nathalie Gauthier, who
had 36.8 percent of the vote.
   The Republic party finished third with 17 percent of the vote.
   ``It's a moral question,'' Carignon said, urging voters to
``form a barrier to the extremist candidate.''
   Carignon was suspended Tuesday on grounds he violated party
policy of abstaining from voting for other party candidates. The
suspension could lead to Carignon's expulsion. If expelled, he
would retain his mayor's post but without formal party backing.
   ``We cannot continue to show our electors this spectacle of
disorder,'' said party secretary general Alain Juppe.
   Carignon served as environment minister when Republic party
leader Jacques Chirac was prime minister from 1986 to 1988.
   The National Front won 12 percent of the vote in national
elections in 1988. It recently won its only seat in the 577-seat
National Assembly.

<TEXT>
   Let's not waste words. ``Six Degrees of
Separation'' by John Guare is a crackling good play, a snappy,
smart tale of Manhattan, made even more intriguing because it is
based on a real incident.
   The production, which opened Thursday at the Mitzi Newhouse
Theater in Lincoln Center, is also wonderfully funny and inventive,
not only in its unexpected plot twists but in the way director
Jerry Zaks brings out its darker, more serious moments.
   Guare, who used a newspaper story as the starting point for his
play, has created a scathing, satiric look at the fads, foibles and
follies of living in Manhattan, circa 1990. The news article told
of a hoax involving a young man who claimed to be the son of actor
Sidney Poitier and how he duped several prominent New York families.
   In Guare's play, just about everyone is a con man. Even its
upper-crust, liberal hero and heroine, Flan and Ouisa, are not
above pulling a scam of sorts. He's an art dealer who courts
wealthy foreigners. You know, says the wife, the kind of people who
can't scrape together enough money for dinner but can come up with
$2 million for a second-rate Cezanne.
   But these East Siders meet their match in Paul, a young man who
shows up at their apartment. The lad, claiming to a friend of their
college-age children, has just been mugged. The couple embrace him,
especially after he says he is Poitier's son.
   The youth cooks dinner for them and is invited to stay. He
promises to introduce them to his father and even get them jobs in
a movie version of ``Cats'' that his father allegedly is directing.
He also dazzles them with conversation about his college thesis on
``The Catcher in the Rye.'' Only later do the entranced couple
learn he is a fraud.
   His cover is blown when Flan's lawyer and his wife tell a
similar story. It seems they were duped by Paul the previous week.
And Guare adds a third victim _ a physician who allows Paul to stay
over in his brownstone.
   The unraveling of Paul's real identity won't be revealed here,
but the detective work involves the children of these wealthy
people. The kids are portrayed as adolescent gargoyles, blaming
their parents for everything that has gone wrong in their lives and
determined to make them suffer.
   Guare has captured their revenge hilariously, particularly in a
diatribe for actor Evan Handler who plays a spiteful son railing
against his father.
   The play then turns serious when Paul's flim-flam takes in a
naive couple from Utah, babes in the big city. The consequences of
his deceptions are tragic. Guare weaves all the stories together,
the one link being the young man who has been able to affect _ for
good and ill _ so many lives.
   The entire cast is first-rate, but special mention should be
made of the three leads. Stockard Channing makes the baffled,
bewildered matron a figure of sympathy by the end of the play. John
Cunningham is the epitome of WASP pomposity as her husband. James
McDaniel is astonishing as Paul, portraying him as victimizer and
victim, too.
   Tony Walton's stylized set is mostly a series of picture frames
and a couch or two strewn on the playing area. But they work
brilliantly to suggest a variety of locales including a bench in
Central Park.
   The odd title, ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' refers to a
concept articulated by Ouisa as she ponders how she and her friends
were brought in contact with Paul. Everybody on the planet is
separated from everybody else by only six people, she says, adding
that the trick is to find the right six people. Guare has not only
found the right people but put them on stage with dazzling results.

   The Justice Department moved Thursday to
revoke the citizenship of a California man accused of persecuting
prisoners while he was a guard at three Nazi camps during World War
II.
   The complaint charged that between November 1943 and March 1945
Johann Ziegler, of Hemet, Calif., was a SS guard at unnamed German
concentration camps in Kaunas, Lithuania, and Stutthof, Poland, and
at Gutenhafen, a slave-labor subcamp in Stutthof.
   ``During that time, thousands of prisoners died as a result of
execution, subjection to slave labor under inhumane conditions,
starvation, disease from unsanitary conditions, torture, and other
methods of killing,'' Neil Sher, head of the Justice Department's
Nazi-hunting unit, said in a statement.
   The complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges
that Ziegler concealed his membership in the SS Death's Head
Battalion and the SS Guard Battalion when he applied for U.S.
citizenship.
   Ziegler is accused of persecuting civilians because of their
race, religion, national origin or political views, according to
the complaint.
   Thirty-two former Nazis living in the United States have been
stripped of their citizenship and 27 removed from the country as a
result of the Justice Department's continuing investigation.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban art museum targeted by exile hard-liners
for showing works by artists considered sympathetic to communist
Cuba was ripped by a terrorist bomb Thursday for the second time in
two years.
   A ``high-order explosive'' blew out the front of the Cuban
Museum of Arts and Culture in Little Havana at 1:09 a.m., said FBI
spokesman Paul Miller.
   ``This is a terrorist incident,'' he said.
   The museum was closed at the time, and there were no injuries.
No arrests have been made, and Miller would not comment on whether
the FBI's anti-terrorism task force in Miami had any suspects.
   It was the 17th Cuban-related bombing or attempted bombing laid
to terrorists in the area in three years.
   The blast damaged artwork inside, scattered debris along the
street outside, broke windows in nearby buildings and left a small
crater in the sidewalk.
   ``It did a considerable amount of damage to the front of the
building, including structural damage to the roof,'' Miller said.
   Damage to the art, pieces by 16 Cuban artists who arrived on the
Mariel boatlift in 1980, was estimated at $10,000, Miller said.
Preliminary estimates of damage to the building ranged into the
tens of thousands.
   ``There is nothing very controversial that we're exhibiting
now,'' said museum Director Osvaldo Monzon. He said the display
``is something that I'm quite proud of ... the art of artists who
came from Mariel and have succeeded greatly.''
   In May 1988, a small pipe bomb blew out the front door while art
from Cuba was on display. Thursday's explosion wasn't caused by a
pipe bomb. FBI experts will analyze evidence from the scene to
determine what it was, Miller said.
   ``The FBI and Miami Police Department believe this is the 17th
device since May 1987 of a terrorist nature ... attributed to
individuals who have targeted individuals, businesses and museums
they believe may advocate better relations with Castro's Cuba,'' he
said.
   Most of the bombs have been small devices placed outside
buildings and homes at night. Before Thursday, the most recent
bombing was at an optical store in suburban Hialeah last September.
   The bombing in May 1988 occurred during a controversy in the
city's Cuban community over the handling of works by artists
considered sympathetic to Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   The day after the bombing, 17 of the museum's directors and five
top officials resigned, saying the institution had lost touch with
the community and the trauma suffered by Cubans on their island
homeland.
   Monzon vowed Thursday that the museum would not be intimidated.
   ``We will continue,'' he said. ``Political pressure and
terrorists will not discourage us.''

   Congress is sending President Bush a bill
requiring employers to give workers up to three months' unpaid
leave for family emergencies, and Bush must decide whether to make
good on his veto threat.
   The Senate gave final approval to the family leave bill in a
voice vote Thursday night after only brief debate.
   Passage, the culmination of a four-year effort by supporters,
was a bit anticlimactic. Republican opponents conceded they could
not defeat the House-passed bill and did not seek a recorded vote.
   Democrats, confident that the measure is popular with voters,
immediately sought to turn up the political pressure on Bush to

   Airlines will have to use better X-ray
machines and pay closer attention to checked-in luggage under new
federal directives responding to a presidential commission on
terrorism.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Federal Aviation
Administration chief James Busey announced several security steps
Thursday, including creation of two high-level posts to oversee
transportation security.
   Busey said airlines would be required to replace older,
less-sensitive X-ray machines with modern ones that have higher
detection standards for carry-on luggage. X-rays, however, cannot
detect plastic bombs.
   Metal detectors that passengers walk through also would have to
be upgraded under the new orders.

   Police in many states have a green light to
use sobriety checkpoints to combat drunken driving, but some _
including a Supreme Court justice _ say that tactic will not work.
   The high court on Thursday upheld Michigan's checkpoint program
and, by extension, similar operations in most states.
   Critics say checkpoints, where all motorists heading in one
direction are pulled over and detained briefly, are not as
efficient as other methods used by police to catch drunken drivers
or keep them off the road.
   ``We must begin to assure that every community will make
checkpoints a key element of an all-out campaign to finally rid our
roads of the menace posed by drinking drivers,'' said Micky Sadoff,
national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

   Gen. George S. Patton's 2nd Armored
Division helped win the Battle of the Bulge, but now it has lost
the battle of the budget.
   The Army has decided to deactivate the unit, ending its colorful
history as the armored division with the longest active service
record. Formed in July 1940 for European service in World War II,
the division is being dismantled 50 years later in anticipation of
European peace.
   ``This division has the most glorious history of any combat unit
in the U.S. Army,'' Lt. Charles MacMaster at Fort Hood said
Thursday.
   Patton dubbed the division ``hell on wheels,'' promising it
would terrify enemies. Its troops adopted the nickname as their
motto. Today, its soldiers still proudly wear ``hell on wheels'' on
their division patch.

   For 40 years, the Army grumbled about Pvt.
Beetle Bailey. He's a real misfit, they said. Lazy. No spit and
polish. Drives the Sarge nuts. He'll never make corporal. Let him
peel potatoes forever.
   Then one fine day, somebody in the Pentagon with silver stars on
his shoulders looked around the table and told the men with silver
eagles on their shirt collars: Hey, you know, the little guy's
funny.
   Yes, sir! they all replied, nodding in unison.
   And so it was that an incredulous Mort Walker, a cartoonist who
once slogged through the mud at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., as an Army
draftee in World War II, was ushered into the Pentagon on Thursday
and given a hero's welcome.

<HEAD>Drought to Drenched: Farmers Hope Latest Cloud Has Silver Lining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>

   Two years ago, Carl Marriott's farm fields were dusty, his
soybeans were shriveled, his prospects bleak. This spring, he has a
different brown, sickly crop, but there's a different culprit: rain.
   Yes, rain, the manna from heaven Midwest farmers hoped and
prayed for these past few years, has flooded fields, delayed
planting and damaged crops. But survivors of one _ or even two _
consecutive droughts aren't complaining.
   ``We just roll with the punches. We've got options we can pull
out of the bag when it's wet,'' said Marriott, a southern Illinois
farmer who may lose a quarter of his waterlogged wheat crop. ``When
it's dry, there's nothing we can do.''
   ``We've been biting our tongues,'' said Mark White, a Chariton,
Iowa, farmer whose fields were parched in 1988 and '89, then too
muddy to work all last month. ``I'll take a wet year over a dry
year anytime. At least you've got a chance to grow something.''
   After the most devastating decade in half a century, marred by
drought, high interest rates and plummeting land values, many
farmers have entered the 1990s with one of the wettest springs in
recent times and the brightest outlook in 10 years.
   ``The farmer is in the best shape he's been since 1980,'' said
Gregory Hanson, an economist at the U.S. Agriculture Department.
``We've got rising land values ... rising sales, rising investment.
I'm not trying to paint a Pollyanna picture _ on the other hand,
there's the famous rubber ball theory of economics: What bounced
down is now bouncing up.''
   Though an unseasonably cool, wet spring may prevent a bumper
crop, the economic forecast is promising: cash income for the farm
sector, which includes government subsidies, has been projected at
$55 billion to $59 billion for 1990 _ a record if it reaches the
outer limit and better than last year's estimated $54 billion.
   Hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels, corn prices
are up because the surplus is down, farm exports have increased,
land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 _ about
the same level they did in 1989 _ and machinery sales have jumped
by 50 percent in the last four years.
   ``When I look at the farm economy, I look at a growth sector,''
Hanson said. ``Ten years ago, it was a sector ready to take a
fall.''
   The national farm debt, which peaked in 1983 at $206 billion,
could dip to as low as $145 billion in 1990, he said.
   Farmers who survived the '80s are smarter and more careful about
their purchases, said Neil Harl, an economics professor at Iowa
State University.
   ``Some have been burned, some were singed, some were just close
to the heat,'' he said. At the same time, he added, ``Lenders are
more cautious and conservative.''
   As the new decade begins, some signs of a turnaround are due to
the weather, some to a reversal in economic fortunes. For example:
   _ In Kansas, a record winter wheat crop is forecast for 1990 _
460.2 million bushels, more than double last year's
drought-battered 213.6 million bushels.
   ``They're laughing,'' Jim Shroyer, extension agronomist at
Kansas State University said of the farmers. ``They're really
looking forward to harvest. This really lifts their spirits.''
   Nationally, winter wheat production is expected to reach a
nine-year high of 2 billion bushels, despite some losses from wet
weather.
   _ In Iowa, land values jumped nearly 45 percent from 1986 to
1989, though they're still far below 1981 peak levels. Less than
one in five farmers had significant money troubles last year,
compared with a third in 1986, Harl said.
   _ In Minnesota, state officials say soil moisture is the best it
has been since November 1986.
   Despite such optimistic signs, drought persists in areas,
including Florida and parts of Colorado. In California, in its
fourth straight dry year, reservoirs are low enough that the state
and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation cut in half the amount of this
year's irrigation water to farmers.
   And in the upper Midwest, even though puddles in the fields make
people smile _ a recent wet spell in North Dakota was dubbed the
``million-dollar'' rain _ they haven't convinced anyone the drought
is over.
   ``By no means are we out of the woods,'' said Tim Edman, special
assistant to South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson. ``If we go back to
the 90-degree-plus windy, dry weather conditions, we could be
facing a problem very quickly just as serious as the last two
years.''
   In 1988, all of South Dakota was declared a drought disaster
area; last year, it was two-thirds of the state.
   While many cursed the drought, others now say rainy, cool
weather is no blessing.
   In Michigan, for example, some apple growers say it's reduced
their crop. In Missouri, a fourth of the corn is in poor or very
poor shape, and planting is five weeks behind schedule. And in
Illinois, pastures with water belly-high to the livestock and
fields too muddy to put a tractor in have farmers worried.
   ``It's rained so much our wheat is full of blight,'' said Herman
Krone, who welcomed then-President Reagan to his shriveled southern
Illinois farm fields in 1988. ``Instead of ripening, it's dying in
standing water. ... It's been 43 years since I've seen something
like this.''
   But it's too early to make dire predictions, and dry, sunny days
last week allowed many farmers to get back into the fields. Some
also say as time runs out to plant corn, they may switch to
soybeans, which have a later growing season.
   That's an option for Marriott, a fourth-generation farmer who
normally would have planted all his corn by now but had completed
less than 5 percent by the second week of June, a situation to
which he's resigned.
   ``Farming is hills and valleys,'' he said. ``You have good crops
some years, and some years, good prices _ seldom together.''
   ``It's either feast or famine,'' said Bill Million, agriculture
extension adviser in Adams County, in western Illinois. ``Farmers
are just taking it one day at a time.''
   Not long ago, Million said, they looked to the skies for
salvation _ rain.
   ``Now they're praying for it to stop _ just a bit,'' he said.
``Typical human beings, we're never satisfied.''

   A hero's welcome awaits Nelson
Mandela in the United States, where the black nationalist leader
will lobby for continued sanctions against South Africa and
millions of dollars in support for the anti-apartheid movement.
   Since his release Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison,
Mandela has been cheered at rallies across Africa and Europe.
   A jubilant reception is expected in the United States for the
deputy president of the African National Congress movement, who is
especially revered among blacks who waged the civil rights battle
of the 1960s.
   President Bush and Congress will receive Mandela in Washington
during his eight-city, 10-day visit, which begins Wednesday in New
York and features parades, rallies and a speech at the United
Nations.
   The other cities on his itinerary are Boston, Atlanta, Miami,
Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.
   Mandela's chief mission is to lobby the U.S. government to
maintain the limited economic sanctions imposed in 1986 after
protests over South African policies of apartheid, or forced
segregation.
   American politicians, movie stars, businessmen and black
organizations all are scrambling to share in the glow of his fame _
or at least have their pictures taken with him _ but Mandela has
remained modest, and acknowledges debts to U.S. supporters of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   ``The blacks in the United States have been in the front lines
of the struggle against apartheid,'' he said recently. ``The (U.S.)
government itself would not have taken the steps which they have
adopted if there was no pressure from the masses of Americans.''
   American public pressure has contributed to the withdrawal of
more than half of the 300 U.S. companies that were operating in
South Africa since the mid-1980s. Many U.S. universities and
municipal governments have withdrawn investments in companies that
remain.
   The release of Mandela, who was imprisoned after being convicted
of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white minority
government, came days after President F.W. de Klerk lifted a
30-year ban on the ANC.
   Now Mandela is hoping to raise millions of dollars to help
formally re-establish the ANC presence inside South Africa. The
efforts include his public appearances, private fundraising dinners
and even the sale of sneakers and T-shirts sporting the ANC colors.
   Some Western governments have indicated a fresh willingness to
reconsider sanctions against South Africa in view of reforms
instituted by de Klerk, who brought about Mandela's release.
   Last month in Brussels, de Klerk urged the 12-nation European
Community to end its sanctions because of ``dynamic'' changes,
including the prospect of black-white talks on ending policies of
racial segregation.
   South Africa's white minority rule governs 5 million whites, 28
million blacks and about 3 million people of mixed race. Apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which blacks have no
vote in national affairs.
   The de Klerk administration has met some, but not all, of the
conditions set by Congress for lifting limited sanctions it imposed
in 1986, overriding a veto by then-President Reagan.
   ``The United States is the only country which has incorporated a
measure in its legislation making it an offense to trade (some
items) with South Africa,'' Mandela said. ``I will applaud the
United States for this.''
   But ties between the ANC and the U.S. government are relatively
new.
   The ANC, with offices in more than 30 countries worldwide, only
last year established a Washington office.
   In 1988, the Defense Department listed the ANC as a
``terrorist'' organization. The State Department disagreed publicly
with the description, but has urged the ANC to abandon its largely
ineffective guerrilla campaign.
   There have been other obstacles.
   Reagan's opposition to sanctions and his ``constructive
engagement'' policy, which stressed the maintenance of working ties
with the white-led government, drew harsh criticism from the ANC
throughout the 1980s. At anti-apartheid rallies, blacks often
denounced Reagan in the same breath with former South African
President P.W. Botha.
   About half the ANC leadership, though not Mandela, also are
members of the South African Communist Party. The ANC's guerrilla
campaign has been backed by the Soviet Union, although military aid
is declining.
   In Angola, ANC guerrillas have fought alongside Marxist
government troops battling the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels.
   Since his release, Mandela has praised Cuba's Fidel Castro,
embraced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and
visited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the man for whom one of
Mandela's grandsons is named.
   Yet Mandela has proven skilled enough as a politician to win the
endorsement of U.S. Jewish groups despite his support for Arafat.
   Abraham Foxman of the U.S. Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith said after meeting Mandela in June that ``no Jewish
organization should have reservations'' about the Mandela visit.
   He added: ``I will probably raise my voice and proclaim he is a
friend.''
   Mandela will spend time with two of his daughters studying in
Massachusetts. Zenani Dhlamini, a student at Boston University, is
the daughter of Mandela and his current wife, Winnie. Mandela's
daughter by his first wife, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, studies at
Amherst College.
   Skeptics say Americans are fixated on Mandela the legend rather
than the man.
   ``What people want is a saint, a sort of moral celebrity,''
wrote Simon Barber, Washington correspondent for the South African
financial paper Business Day.
   At home, Mandela faces critics ranging from right-wing whites
who call him a terrorist to militant blacks who accuse the ANC of
``selling out'' by pursuing negotiations with de Klerk's government.
   Any criticism in the United States is likely to be tame by
comparison.
   ``Woe betide the policymaker, politician, scholar or journalist
who evinces the slightest skepticism,'' Barber wrote. ``This is
particularly true in the U.S., where the civil rights movement has
adopted Mandela as a sort of Martin Luther King reborn.''

   Nelson Mandela is taking
center stage during his lobbying mission for black nationalism in
South Africa, but controversy still swirls around his wife.
   Winnie Mandela will accompany her husband on his eight-city,
10-day tour of the United States, which starts Wednesday in New
York.
   The woman who once shouted down police and was accused of
beating men with whips, has been standing demurely by his side
during the couple's tours of Africa and Europe.
   A year ago, some of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid
leaders denounced Mrs. Mandela, accusing her of ``violating human
rights in the name of the struggle against apartheid.''
   The South African attorney-general is considering whether to
prosecute Mrs. Mandela in connection with a case of kidnapping and
assault in which one of the victims later was found dead.
   Her former chief bodyguard, Jerry Richardson, has been convicted
of kidnapping, assault, and murder in connection with the stabbing
death of a 14-year-old black activist, James ``Stompie'' Moeketsi
Seipei.
   He was abducted Dec. 29, 1988, and his body recovered eight days
later.
   Three black men testified at Richardson's trial that they and
the teen-ager were abducted, taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and
beaten by Mrs. Mandela, who then let her bodyguards continue the
assaults.
   The judge ruled their testimony had ``the ring of truth.''
   The trial of Mrs. Mandela's former driver and seven others who
stayed at her house originally was scheduled for May 29, but has
been postponed until September, said Klaus von Lieres und Wilkau,
attorney-general for the Johannesburg region.
   He said his office ``has reserved a decision on whether to
prosecute (Mrs. Mandela) or not. At this stage, we have not taken a
decision.''
   Mrs. Mandela has been the focus of controversy, or at least
attention, many times before.
   She was under police restrictions almost continuously from 1963
to 1986, was arrested numerous times and held in solitary
confinement for 17 months in 1969-70.
   During nationwide unrest from 1984-87, she appeared at the
funerals of slain activists and gave militant speeches, urging
blacks to harbor guerrilla fighters and take the ``armed struggle''
to white neighborhoods.
   Without explaining why, the government lifted her restrictions
on movement and speech in 1986, shortly after she told a rally:
``With our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we shall liberate
this country.''
   It was an endorsement of the gruesome ``necklace'' killings in
which militants set burning, gasoline-soaked tires around the necks
of black political opponents, policemen and their families.
   The African National Congress in exile disavowed the statement
by the wife of its effective leader.
   Some say Mrs. Mandela was not equipped for the public position
thrust upon her as the spokesman for her imprisoned husband and his
outlawed movement.
   She married Mandela in 1958, when she was a 24-year-old social
worker and he was a 40-year-old ANC leader. Four years later, he
was arrested.
   Mandela once wrote from prison that he wondered ``whether any
kind of commitment can ever be sufficient excuse for abandoning a
young and inexperienced woman in a pitiless desert.''
   When her husband was freed and came home to Soweto, Mrs.
Mandela, a 56-year-old grandmother, said she was glad to become a
housewife, a job she had never had a chance to do.
   ``I've been giving orders, and now I have to take them,'' she
said.

   Here are some facts about
Nelson Mandela:
   NAME: Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
   AGE: 71.
   BORN: July 18, 1918, in Transkei, the son of a Xhosa tribal
chief.
   TITLE: Deputy President of the African National Congress.
   ARRESTED: August 5, 1962.
   SENTENCED: November 1962 to five years hard labor for leaving
the country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by
striking. Sentenced in June 1964 to life imprisonment for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   IMPRISONED: 27 years.
   RELEASED: February 11, 1990.
   CURRENT POLITICAL OBJECTIVE: Mandela says dialogue between the
South African government and the ANC is the only way to a peaceful
future. He wants the government to free all prisoners convicted of
politically motivated crimes, stop police from firing on black
protesters, and end the state of emergency in the Natal province,
where ANC supporters are battling members of the rival Inkatha
organization.
   When those conditions are met, he says, the ANC and the
government can enter into negotiations, apparently including other
political organizations, to develop a new non-racial, democratic
constitution based on a one-person, one-vote system.
   CURRENT TOUR: Mandela is in the midst of a six-week tour of
Africa, Europe and North America to thank the world for pressuring
the South African government to remove the ban on the ANC and free
him and his colleagues.
   He also is urging that economic, cultural, diplomatic and sports
sanctions be maintained against South Africa until apartheid is
completely abolished.

Japanese foot-dragging in recent trade talks, which are aimed at
reducing the United States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Critics say Japan's intransigence is directly linked to the Bush
administration's decision to lessen the threat of economic
sanctions against Japan by removing the country from a section of
trade law known as Super 301.

   The Soviet legislature has ordered a two-month
delay in an unpopular threefold increase in bread prices, a
centerpiece of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's market reforms.
   The Supreme Soviet voted overwhelmingly Thursday to have the
government produce another version of the plan in September, easing
the effect of price increases.
   Bread prices, the staple of the Soviet diet, would have risen
July 1. The increase was part of an economic program that touched
off panic buying in Moscow.

   After 198 years of trading stocks only during
the daytime, the New York Stock Exchange plans to phase in a
24-hour market by the end of the decade to meet increasing
competition from overseas.
   Big Board chairman John J. Phelan Jr. on Thursday unveiled a
five-step plan expected to begin later this year that would allow
access to the nation's largest exchange after the current 4 p.m.
Eastern time close.
   ``There is some volume going overseas, and we'd like to capture
some of that volume back,'' Phelan said in Nashville, Tenn., where
he was meeting with officials from a regional brokerage.
   Round-the-clock trading is already a reality in the foreign
currency and U.S. Treasury bond market, where dealers conduct
transactions via telephone and computer links.
   But the concept has stirred controversy at the stock exchange
because it could lead to replacing the powerful ``specialists,''
who today regulate the flow of trading, with computers.
   ``It's an incredible surprise,'' one veteran specialist who
asked not to be named said. ``The incredible thing is that the
floor hasn't lynched anyone yet.''
   Nevertheless, the exchange has been pressured by new technology
and competing markets that allow traders to buy and sell Big
Board-listed stocks domestically and abroad when the NYSE is closed.
   The London exchange, which eliminated its specialists and
trading floor when it went electronic four years ago, and the Tokyo
market have siphoned the most business.
   The steps outlined by Phelan would begin with two brief sessions
after the market's normal close. Subsequent phases would involve
stock auctions held several times a night, some form of
conventional trading overnight and finally 24-hour dealing.
   Market experts said that by phasing in the plan, the NYSE could
stimulate after-hours interest. The exchange could determine, for
instance, whether the floor should stay open round-the-clock or
whether after-hours trading be strictly electronic.
   ``The limiting factor here is the demand, it's not the
technology,'' said Eric K. Clemons, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ``What if you had a 24-hour
market and nobody came?''
   ``What the NYSE wants to do is make sure institutions feel they
have no choice, that if they want to trade a (major U.S.) stock,
the only place to trade is New York,'' he said.
   Exchange officials said they planned to implement the first two
phases of the plan by the end of the year, assuming member firms
agree. This level would involve sessions that could last one to two
hours and handle activity mainly related to program trading.
   In the third phase, expected to begin in 1991, the exchange
would hold auctions of each listed stock at 8 p.m., midnight, and 5
a.m. Eastern time. Each stock would trade once at each auction with
trades combined at a single price. More than 1,700 stocks are
listed on the exchange and all could be included in the auctions.
   Phelan said the fourth phase would involve ``some sort of
rudimentary trading during the night.'' It could begin by 1992.
   The final step _ non-stop, round-the-clock trading _ is five to
10 years off, exchange officials said.
   ``I'm not skeptical about it long term. But I think short term
there is a serious question whether there is a lot out there, and
that's (what) we're proposing to do with steps,'' Phelan said.
   Current trading hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time.
Trading ran from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to noon
on Saturdays from 1873 until 1952, when weekend trading was
abolished and weekday activity extended until 3:30 p.m. An extra
half hour was added in 1974 and 1985.
   Market players estimate the NYSE has lost 10 million to 20
million shares a day of trading to foreign markets, where many U.S.
companies now list their securities. Also, other domestic markets
that offer after-hours trading via computer pose a threat.
   Big Board volume has slumped since the stock market crashed in
1987 and has averaged about 156 million shares daily this year.
   Several Wall Street professionals questioned whether there is
enough demand to sustain after-hours trading. They said an attempt
merely to regain volume lost to London might fail because certain
trades there can be conducted with less public scrutiny.
   Others said after-hours trading could grow once a system is in
place.
   ``The very fact that it's available might encourage more and
other types of activities,'' said Jack A. Conlon Jr., managing
director in charge of equities for Rothschild Inc.

<HEAD>West German Settles Insider Trading Charges With SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German computer executive has agreed to
settle U.S. civil charges of using inside information to avoid a
$2,000 stock loss.
   The executive lives in Germany but worked for an American
company and was charged with illegal insider trading in the
company's shares.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Wolfgang Marcour, of
Wiesbaden, West Germany, settled a civil complaint filed Thursday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission at federal court in
Washington.
   It was the second small insider trading case the SEC brought
this week against foreign nationals.
   On Monday, a New York banker and his bond-trader wife, both
Japanese nationals, agreed to pay $99,000 in penalties and
restitution to settle unrelated insider trader charges.
   Unlike Marcour, they both lived in this country.
   Marcour, 47, agreed to pay the U.S. government $2,062 in trading
losses he avoided, as well as $358 in interest.
   Marcour's West German lawyer, Michael Siebold, was traveling and
could not be reached for comment, SEC officials said.
   According to the SEC complaint, Marcour, who lives and works in
West Germany, sold 500 shares of Apollo Computer Inc. stock in July
1988 _ allegedly with knowledge that Apollo's sales for that
quarter ``would be significantly lower than expected.''
   At the time, Marcour was an international sales manager at
Apollo's wholly owned European subsidiary, Apollo Domain Computer
GmbH, and handled the account of Siemens AG, a major West German
electronics company.
   Harry J. Weiss, an associate director of the SEC's Enforcement
Division, said Marcour was subject to U.S. securities laws because
``an employee of an American public company who happens to be based
in a foreign country is under the same legal duties to his employer
as an American-based employee of the same company.''
   Apollo Computer, based in Chelmsford, Mass., was acquired by
electronics giant Hewlett-Packard Co. in May 1989.
   Weiss would not comment on how the SEC obtained information
about Marcour. The United States does not have a formal cooperation
agreement on securities law violations with West Germany.
   He said that even sales managers could be subject to insider
trading sanctions if ``they are able to observe information that is
material but non-public, not available to the public, and then
trade on it for their own benefit.''

<HEAD>S&amp;P Lowers Chrysler, Ford Ratings; Affirms GM</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a reflection of the pressures facing U.S.
automakers, a leading rating agency has lowered its credit rankings
for Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Thursday it was downgrading the
outstanding debt of the nation's No. 2 and No. 3 automakers by one
notch. The action was particularly troublesome for Chrysler because
it left the struggling company with S&amp;P's lowest investment grade
rating.
   S&amp;P said the nation's Big Three automakers were faced with
severe problems in a sagging market and slumping economy. It left
General Motors Corp.'s rating unchanged, however, saying GM was
better positioned to withstand the pressure.
   The move came one day after Moody's Investor Services Inc.,
another major rating agency, said it was reviewing Chrysler's
credit and would decide by the end of the month whether to
downgrade the company.
   Chrysler's stock fell 25 cents a share to $15.62{ on the New
York Stock Exchange Thursday. Ford was unchanged at $46.37{ and GM
fell 37{ cents to $49.62{.
   ``Chrysler has derived the bulk of earnings in recent years from
such niche products as the minivan and sport-utility vehicles,''
said S&amp;P Vice President Scott Sprinzen, ``and pressure from
competing product offerings is mounting.''
   Recently, Ford and GM began selling four-door sport-utility
vehicles that compete directly with Chrysler's Jeeps.
   Sprinzen said Ford was raising its capital spending, which will
force it to delay reducing the huge debt amassed in the recent
acquisitions of The Associates Corp., a financial organization, and
British automaker Jaguar PLC. Those two purchases cost Ford nearly
$6 billion.
   S&amp;P dropped Ford one notch to double-A-minus from double-A. The
new rating still is one of the agency's higher investment grades.
   Chrysler was dropped one notch from triple-B to triple-B-minus,
S&amp;P's lowest investment-grade level. Anything lower and Chrysler's
debt would be considered to be junk bonds.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said the downgrade was
unwarranted.
   ``Moreover, Chrysler also notes that just recently the market
readily accepted the landmark offering of $1.1 billion 30-year
Auburn Hills Trust certificates, thereby expressing high confidence
in the company over a very long term,'' Houston said.
   In April, Chrysler announced it would sell its
yet-to-be-completed technical center in Auburn Hills, north of
Detroit, through 30-year certificates and then lease it back. The
deal was expected to raise nearly $800 million.
   Chrysler's first quarter profits fell 80 percent to $71 million.
Sales of its North American-made cars and trucks were down 13
percent this year as of June 10.
   The company's share of the U.S. car market has slipped to 11.4
percent from 13.1 percent a year ago; its portion of the truck
market dropped to 21.8 percent from 23.2 percent last year.
   Spokesman Tom Foote said Ford was disappointed with S&amp;P's
decision. The company's balance sheet is strong ``and we expect our
investments to lead to further strengthening of our financial
situation,'' he said.
   Ford reported first quarter earnings of $506.2 million, down 70
percent from a year ago. Its sales of cars and trucks were down 8.8
percent through June 10. The company's share of the U.S. car market
stood at 27.9 percent, down from 30.2 percent last year; its truck
share slipped to 34.2 percent from 34.4 percent.
   Sprinzen said even though GM faced increased competition and the
possibility of lower profit margins, it was in a better position
than Ford or Chrysler.
   ``These problems have not reached the extent, relative to GM's
current ratings, that a reassessment of its credit quality is
warranted,'' he said.
   Recently, auto analyst Ronald Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in San Francisco recommended that Ford and Chrysler investors
switch to GM because GM was more likely to raise its stock dividend
next year.
   GM's first quarter earnings fell 54.3 percent to $710 million.
Its combined car and truck sales through June 10 were off 4.8
percent from last year. Its share of the car market slipped nearly
1 percentage point to 46.1 percent; in trucks, it gained to 40.5
percent from 39.3 percent.

<HEAD>Southland Announces Restructuring, Missed Bond Payment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA WEISGERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the bondholders' committee for
debt-ridden Southland Corp. remains optimistic that the company can
get back on its feet with a new, sweetened restructuring plan.
   One of the company's bondholders scoffed at the new plan and
said he would reject the offer.
   Southland, owner of 7,000 7-Eleven convenience stores, on
Thursday enhanced its debt swap proposal to bondholders. The new
plan would slash the amount of control the founding Thompson family
will have.
   The company also said it would not pay $69 million in interest
due on two bond issues today, which opens up the possibility of an
involuntary bankruptcy petition being filed against Southland.
   The bondholder proposal, which Southland called the second phase
in its attempt to climb out from under $1.8 billion in debt, would
cut the stake that the Thompson family and other existing
shareholders will have to 6.5 percent, compared with 15 percent in
an earlier proposal.
   The company is offering bondholders $550 million in exchange for
$1.76 billion in outstanding securities. In addition, bondholders
and preferred stockholders would share 18.5 percent of the
company's common stock.
   The new offer would give bondholders about $200 million more
than an earlier plan.
   The first phase of the restructuring, announced in March, called
for Southland's Japanese partners, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and
Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., to pay $400 million cash for 75
percent of the company. But the Japanese investors agreed to hold
off consummating that deal until August 15 pending a debt
restructuring.
   ``Assuming an agreement can be reached over the next couple of
days, the hope is that a specific proposal would be filed with the
SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) by about the middle of
next week,'' said John Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp.
of New York and head of a bondholders committee that worked out the
agreement with Southland management and others.
   Gordon said he was ``enthusiastic'' about the negotiations and
said it provided an opportunity for Southland to ``really get back
on its feet.''
   Suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth, Southland has
been strained by debt associated with its $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout in 1987, which gave Dallas' Thompson family control of the
chain.
   The company lost $69.4 million in the first quarter. It
completed the sale of its Citgo subsidiary in January to raise
$661.5 million in cash. The initial $350 million bond buyout offer
was made shortly after that sale.
   Gordon called the initial offer ``totally unacceptable,'' but
said he was impressed with the negotiations this week that led to
the improved offer.
   At least one other bondholder was not as enthusiastic.
   ``It's incredible the size of the pill that they're asking
bondholders to swallow,'' said Jay H. Lustig, head of the high
yield department for Drake Capital Securities Inc. of Santa Monica,
Calif.
   ``They're asking bondholders to forgive $1.2 billion in debt in
exchange for 18 percent of the company. They have absolutely zero
shot of getting 100 percent acceptance,'' he said.
   A missed interest payment Friday raises the possibility that
Southland could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy if a payment
or agreement is not worked out in 30 days, Lustig said.
   Gordon said he was optimistic the parties would reach an
agreement that would avoid such a move. Lustig was not.
   ``I know one bond holder who's not tendering the bonds,'' he
said. ``You're talking to him.''

<HEAD>Four Arrested for Alleged Tax Evasion in Hostile Takeover Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have arrested four men accused of
evading taxes on profits made on the stock of the company that was
the target of the first hostile takeover in Japan's corporate
history.
   The four apparently profited from inside information on the
takeover attempt, prosecutors said. But because the transactions
occurred before Japan tightened insider trading regulations in
April 1988, they were arrested only on suspicion of tax evasion,
the prosecutors said Thursday.
   The four were arrested last Wednesday and prosecutors searched
their homes and offices Thursday.
   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office said the four
allegedly concealed income totaling the equivalent of $10.1 million
from stock transactions in 1987 in shares of Kokusai Kogyo, a
Tokyo-based aerial surveying firm.
   Kokusai Kogyo was taken over in December 1987 by the Koshin Co.,
known for its stock speculation activities.
   When the takeover attempt began in May 1987, Kokusai Kogyo
shares were trading at about 2,000 yen, or $13. In an effort to
maintain control, Kokusai Kogyo began buying back shares. By
October 1987, the price had soared to 7,000 yen, or $45.60.
   Prosecutors identified those arrested as Norio Ishibashi, 49,
Hiromitsu Hamaguchi, 50, and Yoshinori Wakisaka, 47, all former
officials of Kokusai Kogyo. Also arrested was Eiji Sakai, 53, a
financial firm president.
   Prosecutors also said they were searching for Jiro Tomishima,
39, president of a subsidiary of Kokusai Kogyo, on suspicion of tax
evasion.
   A senior official at the prosecutor's office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said, ``We are certain that he is out of
country, but we cannot say at this point whether we have sent our
investigators overseas nor have we requested cooperation from
foreign investigatory agencies.''
   Ishibashi, who was in control of Kokusai Kogyo's accounting,
bought more than 500,000 shares for himself during the takeover
battle and netted a profit of about $3.97 million, prosecutors
said. They said the other three arrested men earned profits ranging
from $1.69 million to $2.08 million.
   The four used dummy accounts to dodge taxation, prosecutors
added.

   It may have appeared to be another marketing
come-on, but a stock giveaway was big business for Kent Electronics
Corp.
   Kent mailed free stock certificates to 1,518 graduate students
and faculty members at the University of Houston's College of
Business Administration in an effort to get its shares listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``I thought it was like the promise of receiving a free gift for
attending a time-share vacation resort,'' said Dale Rude, associate
professor of management.
   ``I read it and was amused and put it aside,'' said doctoral
student John Michael Bryant, who said he expected a follow-up sales
pitch. ``I'm studying for a degree in marketing so I read all my
junk mail, seeing what the trends are.''
   The shares, which closed at $11.50 on the American Stock
Exchange Thursday, were given away to satisfy a requirement for
listing on the Big Board, said Morrie Abramson, chairman of the
electronics products distributing company in Houston.
   Kent, a 17-year-old company with annual revenues of about $40
million, met all but one of the standards for listing _ the one
requiring at least 2,200 shareholders. Kent had only 1,200.
   So the company bought 1,518 shares of its stock on the open
market for more than $17,000. Using a mailing list supplied by the
university, Kent sent a certificate for one share to each graduate
student and faculty member in the business school.
   And it worked. The company expects to begin trading on the New
York Stock Exchange July 6.
   ``There was nothing, in our judgment, that was very creative
about it,'' Abramson said.
   He figures it was an appropriate way to show his appreciation.
In 1956, he graduated from the University of Houston with a
bachelor's degree in business administration. He now serves on the
Dean's Executive Advisory Board, a group of about 50 Houston
business leaders.

   Consumers who are worried about the ozone or
overcrowded landfills will soon be able to look for a new
environmental seal of approval when deciding what to buy in the
supermarket.
   An independent, non-profit organization called Green Seal will
test products for their ``cradle-to-grave'' impact on the
environment and award seals _ a bold green check arched over a blue
globe _ to those that meet its standards.
   ``We're trying to harness the most powerful forces we have
available in the United States, the forces of the marketplace, to
try to achieve environmental goals,'' Denis Hayes, chairman of
Earth Day 1990 and chairman and chief executive officer of Green
Seal, said Thursday.
   At a news conference at the New York Academy of Sciences, he
said Green Seal will start early next year by awarding seals in
five product categories: light bulbs, laundry cleaners, house
paint, toilet paper and facial tissue.
   These products were selected because they are used in almost
every household in the country and some are clearly friendlier to
the environment than others, said Norman Dean, the program's
executive director.
   Hayes said Green Seal will not issue seals for food.
   In April, the American Heart Association yanked its seal of
approval program for foods low in sodium, cholesterol and saturated
fats after the federal Food and Drug Administration said it would
not support the program.
   The FDA said what goes on food labels is a government
responsibility.
   Green Seal Inc. was founded last year by Rena M. Shulsky, a
partner in a Manhattan real estate firm and president of a
Boston-based media consulting firm. She said she came up with the
idea while standing in a grocery store aisle, wondering which
laundry detergent would be friendlier to the environment.
   ``I thought, `Why doesn't someone put a seal on these things? A
little seal of approval would help me get out of the supermarket a
lot quicker.' ''
   Green Seal's first task will be to determine the standards by
which the products will be judged, said Dean. In doing so, it will
examine the full life cycle of each product category _ from raw
material to when the consumer recycles it or throws it into the
garbage.
   The organization intends to solicit advice from manufacturers of
the products, public interest organizations, trade associations and
government officials in establishing its criteria for awarding
seals.
   Once the standards are set, companies _ at their own cost _ may
submit their products for testing by independent laboratories
selected by Green Seal.
   Products that get the Green Seal check of approval will be
licensed to use the seal logo in their advertising for a three-year
period. The licensing fees will be structured on a sliding scale to
prevent hardship for smaller companies.
   According to a poll conducted by Research &amp; Forecasts Inc. for
Green Seal, 79 percent of those surveyed said they would be more
likely to purchase a product with the Green Seal, if choosing
between two products of the same price and equal quality.
   Green Seal is not the first seal-of-approval program for
environmentally preferable products. West Germany has had a program
for 10 years, Canada for three years and Japan for a couple of
years, Hayes said.
   Also, Green Cross Certification Co., based in Oakland, Calif.,
launched an environmental certification program for products in
April with three West Coast grocery chains and one in Phoenix.
   Three food chains in the northeast and Canada will join the
program in July, said Stan Rhodes, president of Green Cross.

<HEAD>Koito's Labor Union Denounces Pickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Koito Manufacturing Co. labor union on Friday
denounced an attempt by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens to get a seat
on the company's board of directors.
   It was the first time the union had publicly denounced Pickens,
who controls the largest equity stake in Koito, and several
proposals he intends to submit to a shareholders meeting later this
month.
   ``The union is against the proposals because they ignore the
company's responsibility to take care of its employees,'' union
Chairman Hideki Yoshioka said in a statement.
   Koito's labor union resolved Thursday that it is against all
seven of Pickens' proposals, which will be voted on at the
company's June 28 shareholders' meeting, ``because they would
destabilize Koito employees' living conditions if they are
approved,'' said the union chief.
   Among the proposals are a demand that four Americans, including
Pickens, be appointed to Koito's board of directors. They also call
for publication of the company's pricing policies, according to
Kanji Ishizumi, Pickens' lawyer.
   Last week, Pickens mailed letters and videos to about 4,100
Koito shareholders, asking for stockholder proxies for the vote on
his proposals.
   Yoshioka called Pickens' proposals ``greenmail,'' or buying up a
company's shares in an attempt to force it or a friendly affiliate
to buy them back at a higher price to regain control.
   He said the union wants board members from Koito, who are
familiar with the company operation and will be understood by
employees.
   According to Koito spokesman Mikio Tsuruta, Koito shareholders
have recently received some harassing newsletters from ``a group
that seems to have links with the underworld, although we're not
certain if Pickens is involved.''
   Sokaiya, or professional racketeers, use their legal right as
shareholders to attend general shareholders meetings, where they
threaten to embarrass the company if they are not paid off
beforehand.
   Of the more than 4,000 shareholders, only about 100 normally
attend shareholders' meetings, with many of the rest sending
proxies, Tsuruta said.
   Since his Boone Co., a U.S. investment firm, obtained the
largest equity stake in Koito last year, Pickens has been fighting
unsuccessfully against Koito management in an attempt to gain a
seat on the board of directors.
   Pickens has said his battle with Koito illustrates how
investment opportunities are closed to foreigners in Japan, but the
company says it is concerned about Pickens' true intentions.

<HEAD>Honeywell Seeks Import Ban on Some Minolta Cameras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BARBARA DEWEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. has asked the government to
ban imports of autofocus cameras made by Minolta Camera Co. Ltd. of
Japan, alleging that the cameras infringe on four Honeywell patents.
   A lawsuit filed by Honeywell against Minolta in 1987 is still
about two years from trial, Honeywell officials said Thursday. In
hopes of getting relief more quickly, Honeywell asked the
International Trade Commission to act, Christopher J. Steffen,
Honeywell's chief financial officer, told a news conference in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Today, with its extremely popular Maxxum camera, Minolta
enjoys annual worldwide sales of $1 billion on its camera products
while Honeywell is denied millions of dollars in royalties as our
lawsuit moves very slowly through the courts,'' Steffen said.
   In addition to the Maxxum, Minolta's Af-Tele and Freedom Dual
models would be affected.
   The Minneapolis-based international controls company asked the
ITC to step in under a 1988 amendment of the Tariff Act of 1930.
The law makes it illegal for overseas companies to engage in unfair
methods of competition, including infringing on U.S. patents, when
importing or selling products in the United States.
   The 1987 lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey on a
change of venue from Minnesota, says Minolta used four Honeywell
patents in Minolta cameras, including the SLR Maxxum.
   Honeywell also contends that Minolta breached a 1979 contract
calling for Honeywell to share patented technology and trade
secrets. Minolta was restricted to using only
Honeywell-manufactured autofocus modules under the contract,
Honeywell said.
   Instead, Honeywell alleges, Minolta used Honeywell autofocus
technology while developing a module of its own.
   Minolta said Thursday that Honeywell's patent claims are
``invalid and unenforceable.'' In a statement issued through its
New Jersey office, Minolta also said that federal court was the
``proper forum for this dispute'' and it called the original
allegations ``baseless.''
   Minolta also said Honeywell's petition violates a 1988 agreement
by both parties that federal court in New Jersey would be the
exclusive forum for resolving the dispute.
   ``We today asked the federal court to uphold this agreement and
order Honeywell to withdraw its complaint,'' Minolta said.
   Honeywell, however, said Minolta's allegations are unfounded.
Honeywell said the 1988 agreement was meant to discourage multiple
court filings and not to affect an administrative action such as an
ITC filing.
   The trade agency has 30 days to decide whether it will review
the case, said Honeywell spokeswoman Susan Eich. If it does, a
decision could come within a year, she said.
   Ed Carroll, an ITC spokesman, said that if the ITC agrees to
investigate, the case would be heard by an administrative law
judge, who would make an initial determination to the commission.
The commission then would decide whether to accept the judge's
determination. If it does, that decision would go to President Bush.
   The president has 60 days to ``do something with it. If he does
nothing at all, the commission decision stands'' and would
automatically go into effect, Carroll said.

<HEAD>Justice Investigating Airline Activities in Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir operations at Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport are under federal scrutiny for possible
antitrust violations, according to the airline's parent company.
   The U.S. Justice Department ordered USAir Group Inc. to turn
over documents and other information relating to USAir activities
at the airport, where it is the largest tenant. The request came
May 31 in an action known as a civil investigative demand, USAir
said.
   The existence of the probe was disclosed by USAir in connection
with the issuance of $84.6 million in revenue bonds for the
construction of a new terminal being built at the airport. USAir
said it was informed by the Justice Department that other airlines
and other airports are being investigated.
   The names of the other carriers and airports were not disclosed.
   Justice Department spokesman Frank Kelly declined to comment on
the nature of the investigation. He said a civil investigative
demand is equivalent to a subpoena but does not mean a civil or
criminal action has been undertaken.
   USAir spokesman John Bronson said the airline would comply with
the Justice Department's request and was gathering all relevant
documents. He said he did not know the exact nature of the Justice
Department inquiry.
   The solicitor for Allegheny County, which has a business
relationship with USAir relating to the new terminal, said the
request for information appears to be part of a broader probe. The
investigation likely involves fares charged by airlines at hub
airports, said Ira Weiss.
   A report issued last year by the federal General Accounting
Office found that fares charged at 15 hub airports were about
one-fourth higher than fares charged at 38 other airports served by
a larger number of carriers.
   The study found that fares charged at Pittsburgh were as much as
8 cents per mile more than fares at the 38 airports.
   Weiss said one aspect of the USAir probe involves its dealings
with the county. The airline and the county negotiated a long-term
lease two years ago for the construction of the new $592 million
terminal.
   ``Any time you have the Justice Department conducting an inquiry
of this nature, it's a cause for alarm,'' Weiss said.
   ``There's no reason to believe there's anything inappropriate
about USAir's role at the existing terminal or at the new midfield
terminal, and we're confident at the conclusion of this proceeding
that things will proceed as they are,'' he added.
   According to the bond statement, the Justice Department is
examining possible violations of the Sherman Act by ``conduct,
activities or proposed action relating to restrictions on
facilities at the airport.''
   The Sherman Act makes it illegal for companies to restrain trade
in the United States or with foreign countries or to conspire to do
so. It also prohibits monopolizing trade or commerce in the United
States or with foreign countries or attempting or conspiring to do
so.
   Weiss said he thought the investigation arose out of USAir's
large share of traffic at the Pittsburgh airport.
   In 1987, the Justice Department opposed the merger of USAir and
Piedmont airlines, but dropped its objections after determining the
consolidation would not hurt competition.

<HEAD>CFTC Commissioner Unfazed By Criticism of Dual-Trading Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Fowler
West was unfazed by a pair of studies concluding the CFTC's
proposed curbs on dual trading are based on flawed research methods
and insufficient data.
   ``You could probably go on and on and on and on and find
academics who would quarrel with certain conclusions and methods,''
West said Thursday after the studies' authors presented their
findings to the CFTC staff in Washington.
   ``Their objections seem to me to be highly technical in
nature,'' West said in a telephone interview from his Washington
office.
   The studies by researchers at the University of California at
Berkeley and Duke University were funded by the nation's eight
major commodity exchanges, whose leaders are fighting the CFTC plan.
   The findings may provide the exchanges with more ammunition with
which to defend dual trading, the controversial but legal practice
among floor brokers of trading for their customers' accounts and
their own at the same time.
   West said the objections would be considered along with other
public comments the CFTC has gathered since announcing its proposal
in January. The public comment period ends July 9.
   Critics contend dual trading provides opportunities for brokers
to cheat their clients. But exchange leaders say the practice
increases market liquidity and cost efficiency.
   A study of dual trading conducted last year by the CFTC disputed
the purported economic benefits of dual trading.
   The CFTC in January proposed a test ban on dual trading in
certain markets, a move the exchanges viewed as the first step
toward outlawing the practice.
   The exchange-sponsored studies examined the process that led to
the CFTC proposal and found it flawed.
   The Duke researchers' complaints included accusations of
measurement errors and inconsistencies in the CFTC study. The
Berkeley analysis said the CFTC failed to weigh dual trading's
benefits against the costs and ignored its functional effects on
markets.
   ``These deficiencies undermine the study's conclusions as well
as its use as a basis for dual-trading curbs,'' the researchers
said.
   Their conclusions were in a statement issued jointly by the
Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and six
other major U.S. commodity exchanges.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has proposed its own,
less-severe curbs on dual trading as an alternative to the CFTC
plan.
   Spokesman Andrew Yemma said he saw no conflict between the
Merc's proposed dual-trading restrictions and its support for the
two university studies.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrank in April</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 8 grafs. This moved on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically to
$6.94 billion in April, the second lowest level in the past six
years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the 17 percent improvement from a
March deficit of $8.36 billion came entirely from a big drop in
imports, which offset a smaller decline in U.S. export sales.
   Imports totaled $39.25 billion in April, 6.2 percent lower than
March, with the decline attributed primarily to lower demand for
foreign oil and a big drop in auto imports.
   Exports fell by 3.5 percent to $32.3 billion. But this was
considered only a small drop off an all-time high of $33.5 billion
set in March.
   America's trade performance has been a pleasant surprise so far
this year, with the deficit showing a much larger improvement than
many analysts thought possible.
   Through the first four months, the deficit has been running at
an annual rate of $92.16 billion, compared to a deficit for all of
1989 of $108.99 billion.
   Many analysts are now forecasting that the 1990 deficit will
drop below $100 billion for the first time since 1983 as export
growth remains strong enough to offset a growing dependence on
foreign oil.
   That would spell good news for the Bush administration, which is
counting on a strong trade performance to keep the economy out of a
recession. Over the past three years, fully one-third of overall
U.S. economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales.
   The April deficit of $6.94 billion was the smallest since a
February imbalance of $6.10 billion with both months turning in the
best trade performance since a $5.7 billion imbalance in December
1983.
   For April, both oil imports and auto imports were down by about
$1 billion each.
   The 20 percent drop in oil imports to a total of $3.75 billion
reflected a drop in the volume of shipments and price.
   America imported 7.55 billion barrels a day, down from 8.42
billion in March, while the average price per barrel fell to
$16.57, down from $18.18.
   Imports of foreign cars declined by 16 percent to $3.68 billion,
with shipments from Japan leading the decline.
   On the export side, there were small declines in a number of
categories including a $150 million fall-off in computer shipments,
a $200 million decline in shipments of telecommunications equipment
and a $130 million drop in U.S. shipments of aircraft engines.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was with Japan, a $4 billion
imbalance, up from a $3.6 billion deficit in March.
   The United States actually posted a surplus with Western Europe
of $1.4 billion, double the March surplus.
   Other deficits included $800 million with Taiwan and $600
million with China, which recently won a one-year extension on its
most-favored-nation lower tariffs from the Bush administration.

   Japan and the United States are going down to the
wire on talks that experts say could make a real difference in the
long run to reduce Japan's fat trade surplus.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama travels to the United States
today for talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III in San
Francisco. Ten days later, trade negotiators from the two countries
meet in Tokyo.
   The goal is to work out the final report on the Structural
Impediments Initiative, the plan to revamp Japan's economic
structure and increase the availability of imported products.
   ``For 15 years Japan talked about opening the market for
individual items, and the trade balance got worse,'' said economist
Richard C. Koo of the Nomura Research Institute.
   ``For the next five years they tried ... adjusting exchange
rates, and that didn't work either. Structural changes are the only
thing left,'' he said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said the trade imbalance with Japan
was $49 billion last year, down from a record $56.3 billion in 1987
but still huge compared to 1980's $9.9 billion.
   The goal of the economic talks is to strengthen an April interim
report hailed by both countries as a success.
   At that time, Japan agreed to increase public works spending,
reform its complex distribution system to make it easier for large
retail stores to break in, crack down on monopolies and work on
lowering land prices. All the reforms should make Japan more
accessible to imports.
   Since then, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has expressed
displeasure with U.S. pressure to extend the reforms beyond what
Japan promised, while U.S. officials have charged Japan with
reneging on its promises.
   Koo said one impetus for change is the Japanese people. They are
demanding imports, indicating Japan is evolving into an
international consumer society after 40 years of managed trade and
sacrificing to build production, he said.
   The rise in consumerism is reflecting in a declining savings
rate, said economist Susumu Kato of Goldman Sachs. The rate is now
about 16 percent of income, compared with about 24 percent in the
1970s. That's still well above the U.S. rate of about 5 percent.
   The rise of the yen in recent years has helped reduce the trade
imbalance by making exports more expensive and U.S. imports cheaper
here. The dollar fell from an average 249 yen in 1985 to 127 yen in
January 1989.
   The dollar has rebounded, averaging nearly 154 yen in May. That
has helped decrease the trade surplus temporarily by raising the
dollar value of imports, but economists worry that in the long run
the yen's weakness will worsen the trade deficit.
   Japan actually increased its exports to the United States 4.5
percent last year, the Commerce Department said. But the surplus
fell because the United States increased its exports to Japan by
18.2 percent to $44.6 billion.
   Some of the increase came in products that the United States had
been trying to get into Japan for years.
   U.S. beef imports rose 38 percent to $879 million, computers
were up 79 percent to $2 billion and wood was up 37 percent to $3.5
billion, according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
   U.S. industry officials caution that while the percentage
figures look impressive, they arise from small bases. Huge
imbalances remain in motor vehicles and electronics, each worth
about $20 billion a year to Japan.
   Kato predicts Japan's surplus with the U.S. won't drop below $15
billion to $20 billion even if negotiations succeed in opening the
Japanese market completely.
   ``We supply VCRs, computers, all kinds of electronic products,''
he said. ``As long as the demand exists, we'll export.''

<HEAD>SEC Approves Western Union Plan to Exchange Debt Notes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange
Commission approved a Western Union Corp. plan to swap $530 million
in debt for new notes and stock in an effort to avert bankruptcy.
   The company plans to issue new notes and common shares in
exchange for up to $530 million of its outstanding debt, including
19\ percent senior secured notes due Dec. 15, 1992, and 16 percent
notes due June 15, 1991. A $51 million payment on the notes is due
Friday.
   The offering begins today and runs through July 13. Western
Union has told federal regulators that mounting interest payments
could force it to see bankruptcy court protection.
   Under the offer approved Thursday, for each $1,000 in face
amount of the old notes, Western Union would issue two classes of
new notes and common stock.
   Note holders would receive $450 worth of new first priority
notes due Sept. 14, 1992, $550 worth of 8 percent second priority
notes due Dec. 31, 1995, 150 common shares, 225 Class C common
shares and 275 Class D common shares.
   The company could opt to extend the maturity date of the new
notes to Dec. 15, 1995, for first priority and to April 30, 1997,
for second priority.
   The offer is part of a Western Union recapitalization plan that
also includes a proposed reclassification of the company's Class A
senior preferred shares and Class B convertible preferred shares
into common shares. The company is proposing to issue 50 common
shares for each Class A share and 10 common shares for each Class B.

   President Bush will keep his pledge to veto
legislation requiring employers to give workers up to three months'
unpaid leave for family emergencies, his spokesman said today.
   The Senate gave final approval to the family leave bill in a
voice vote Thursday night after brief debate.
   Passage, the culmination of a four-year effort by supporters,
was a bit anticlimactic. Republican opponents conceded they could
not defeat the House-passed bill and did not seek a recorded vote.
   At the White House, Bush was asked this morning during a photo
session whether he would veto the legislation as the White House
had threatened.
   Bush did not reply, but his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,
said, ``Yes,'' when asked the same question as reporters filed out
of the photo session with Paraguay's President Andres Rodriguez.
   The remark immediately drew a complaint from the bill's chief
Republican sponsor, Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who called the bill
``a bedrock family issue.''
   ``The political implications, I think, are very dicey,'' Roukema
said in a telephone interview.
   ``The point that has to be considered here is, do we want to be
perceived as the party that fights for a reduction in the capital
gains tax while we turn our backs on taxpaying, hard-working
American families who are in medical crisis,'' she said.
   Bush, according to his spokesmen, supports voluntary leave but
contends that forcing employers to provide the leave amounts to
excessive government intervention in the workplace.
   Democrats, confident that the measure is popular with voters,
immediately sought to turn up the political pressure on Bush to
sign the bill.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, quoted from one
of Bush's own 1988 campaign speeches, in which he seemed to support
just such employee leave guarantees.
   He quoted Bush as saying: ``We also need to ensure that women
don't have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a
child or caring for a child after a serious illness.''
   ``It's time to see if President Bush advocates the same policies
as president as he did on the campaign trail when he sought the
presidency in 1988,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the bill's sponsor, said in an
interview that he would try to meet with Bush to urge he sign the
measure. Dodd noted that the public veto threats were delivered by
Bush's spokesmen and aides.
   ``He has not personally said anything,'' Dodd said. ``I'd like
to go meet with him and make my case. We think we've got a strong
case to make here.''
   Opponents said they were counting on a presidential veto and
were confident they had the votes to sustain a veto in the House.
   The bill passed comfortably in the House last month, although
the margin fell 46 votes short of the two-thirds majority that
would be needed to override a veto.
   ``There simply are not the votes available to us to frustrate
passage,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., an opponent of the
bill. ``We concede the Senate's will is to pass this bill. ...
Tonight, we've lost.''
   The bill requires business and government employers to provide
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or leave for
the care of a newly born or adopted child or an ill child, parent
or spouse.
   It exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and workers
who are the highest-paid 10 percent within a company.
   Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for
those on leave and restore a returning employee to his or her
previous job or an equivalent position.
   Business groups have strongly opposed the bill. Their lobbyists
met with White House chief of staff John Sununu on May 7 and said
he promised them Bush would veto the bill if sent to his desk.
Presidential spokesmen later repeated the veto threat.
   Senate passage came after leaders worked out a bipartisan
agreement to take up the bill quickly and avoid a roll call vote.
Dodd joked that he had come ready for a floor fight and was a bit
disappointed by the lack of one.
   ``I've learned long ago you don't argue about a victory when you
get one,'' he said. ``I'm also convinced that had it come to a
(recorded) vote we would have prevailed.''
   Dodd acknowledged he might not have enough votes in the Senate
to override a veto, but said he was close.
   Opponents contend the bill would be costly and burdensome for
businesses, and represents a government intrusion into affairs best
left to business and labor. Supporters said nearly all
industrialized nations already provide such minimum job security to
workers, and many have provisions for full or partial pay.
   The bill also would cover federal employees, with even more
generous leave provisions. It would cover House employees but not
employees of the Senate.

   Stock prices fell today as the market absorbed
the impact of a quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.16 to 2,919.06
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 403 up, 746 down and
577 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 91.66 million shares at
midmorning.
   The government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.2
percent in May, not far from most advance estimates.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said the nation's trade
deficit shrank to $6.94 billion last month from $8.45 billion in
April, registering a larger-than-expected decline.
   But analysts said it was hard to gauge investors' reactions to
either of those developments in the midst of the witching hour,
involving a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   As the process began of settling multiple transactions involving
those contracts and individual stocks, a preponderance of sell
orders showed up in a good many blue-chip issues.
   Losers among the volume leaders included Exxon, down \ at 47~;
Philip Morris, down { at 43~; General Motors, down \ at 49&rsqb;, and
International Business Machines, down &lsqb; at 120}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.60 to 197.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .60 at 363.70.

<TEXT>
   Falling vegetable and fuel oil prices in May
held consumer inflation to a modest 0.2 percent for the second
consecutive month, the government said today.
   For the first five months of the year, the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index has advanced at an annual rate of 5.8 percent.
That's up significantly from the 4.6 rate for all of last year, but
down sharply from the worrisome 8.5 percent rate in the first
quarter.
   The good news was expected by most economists, who said prices
are recovering from a cold weather jolt at the beginning of the
year.
   ``Just as first quarter inflation was overstated, inflation (in
April and May) was understated,'' said economist Michael K. Evans,
a Washington-based consultant. ``We're almost sure price increases
are going to get bigger again next month.''
   In other economic news, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
trade deficit shrank dramatically to $6.94 billion in April, the
second lowest level in the past six years. Many analysts are now
forecasting that the 1990 deficit will drop below $100 billion for
the first time since 1983.
   According to the Federal Reserve, industrial production
rebounded an unexpectedly strong 0.6 percent in May after no change
in April. An earlier estimate by the central bank had showed
production falling in April. The operating rate of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percentage point to 83.6
percent in May.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that ``despite
the temporary increase in the first quarter, over the last 12
months consumer prices have increased 4.4 percent. Inflation
remains low and under control.''
   As for the trade figures, he noted that the deficit in the first
four months of the year was 10 percent lower than in the same
period of 1989. ``This is an encouraging downward trend,''
Fitzwater said.
   Today's mild inflation report, which was anticipated, and the
strong industrial production report, a surprise, combined to push
bond prices lower in early trading this morning.
   Traders took the reports as a sign that inflation has not yet
moderated enough nor the economy weakened sufficiently to cause the
Federal Reserve Board to relax its tight monetary policy and allow
short-term interest rates to fall.
   The Labor Department said price of fruit and vegetables fell 2.4
percent, the third substantial drop in a row. Vegetables soared
29.2 percent in the first two months of the year before falling
23.6 percent in the next three months.
   Food overall in May rose just 0.1 percent after edging down 0.2
percent in April.
   Dairy product costs fell for the third consecutive month in May
while prices were up for sweets, fats and oils and beverages.
   Energy prices fell 0.7 percent, the fourth monthly decline
following a large increase in January. Fuel oil fell 1.4 percent,
and natural gas, 2.7 percent. However, electricity charges rose 1
percent.
   Gasoline prices rose modestly, but less than usual for the start
of the warm weather driving season. Thus, after seasonal
adjustment, gasoline prices were reported down 1.6 percent.
   Excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors, prices
rose a moderate 0.3 percent following a 0.2 percent rise in April.
Economists consider this so-called core rate a better indication of
underlying inflation because it moves less erratically.
   New car prices edged down 0.2 percent, the fourth consecutive
decline in the face of sluggish sales.
   Apparel prices, which had been up sharply earlier in the year
because a warm February got spring sales off to an early start,
fell 0.3 percent last month. The price of men's clothing rose 0.4
percent, but women's and children's clothing fell 1 percent and 2.2
percent respectively.
   The price of medical care jumped 0.8 percent in May for the
fourth consecutive month, pushing those costs 9 percent higher than
a year ago.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
129.2 in May. That means a hypothetical selection of goods and
services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $129.20 last
month, up from $123.80 a year ago.
   Wholesale prices, which rose 0.3 percent in May, have behaved
more moderately than consumer prices. The Labor Department's
Producer Price Index is up at only a 4 percent annual rate so far
this year, down from 4.8 percent for all of last year.
   Economists point to the different composition of the two indexes
as an explanation for their divergence. The producer index is
composed entirely of prices for goods, while services account for
about 55 percent of the consumer index.
   Because unemployment remains low, at 5.3 percent over most of
the last year, services, and the cost of services, have been less
affected by the economic slowdown engineered by the central bank.
   Today's release of consumer prices is the earliest in 30 years,
according to Labor Department analyst Patrick Jackman. The report
is usually released around the 27th of the month, but increasing
use of computers is allowing the department to release it earlier,
he said.
   This month's producer report, released Thursday, came out a bit
later than usual. As a result, the two reports were issued on
consecutive days for the first time in recent memory.

   Stock prices declined broadly today as the
market absorbed the impact of a quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.64 to
2,916.58 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 426 up, 856 down and
546 unchanged.
   The government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.2
percent in May, not far from most advance estimates.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said the nation's trade
deficit shrank to $6.94 billion last month from $8.45 billion in
April, registering a larger-than-expected decline.
   But analysts said it was hard to gauge investors' reactions to
either of those developments in the midst of the witching hour,
involving a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   As the process began of settling multiple transactions involving
those contracts and individual stocks, a preponderance of sell
orders showed up in a good many blue-chip issues.
   Losers among the volume leaders included Exxon, down { at 47|;
Philip Morris, down { at 43~; General Motors, down \ at 49&rsqb;;
Coca-Cola, down &rsqb; at 44{, and International Business Machines, down
&lsqb; at 120}.
   Elsewhere, battered gold-mining stocks staged a modest rally.
ASA Ltd. gained ~ to 43~; Homestake Mining | to 16&rsqb;, and Newmont
Gold 1&rsqb; to 38.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.88 to 197.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .48 at 363.82.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.50 million shares at
noontime, up from 71.19 million at the same point Thursday.

   Retail sales are down, and installment credit
has begun to cool. Housing starts are off too, and cars aren't
selling at rates envisioned by carmakers. Manufacturing jobs have
been shrinking for months.
   After his usual quarterly survey of smaller businesses,
economist William Dunkelberg appropriately summed up the condition,
the mood and the outlook for the economy in one terse sentence.
   ``The economy isn't going anywhere in particular,'' said
Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's School of Business and
Management, ``and its going `anywhere' at a rather slow and erratic
pace.''
   The giving and taking and getting and spending of the
marketplace has indeed slowed to a shuffle, and the best thing that
can be said for it is that after nearly eight years of expansion
you can't expect much more.
   Still, Americans adjusted to expansion in that time, and they
didn't care how they got it _ by borrowing and leveraging or by
working two jobs or by putting off having a family or sometimes by
increasing productivity.
   Now that expansion is threatened, they angrily try to place the
blame _ on the Japanese who restrict their marketplace, on the
Reagan administration and its budget deficits, on spendthrift
Congresses.
   President Bush comes in for his share, and so does Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who seeks to reduce
inflation to zero even if the shuffle becomes a crawl. The weather
gets blamed too.
   It was the viciously cold weather last December, you may
remember, that kept people from looking at houses to buy. It was a
rather cool spring in some areas, it is said, that depressed retail
sales below expectations.
   Some folks even blame the Commerce Department, contending that
the figures are never what they seem to be after the inevitable
revisions are completed, and the seasonal adjustment factors are
re-examined for accuracy.
   While any of these reasons might possibly have something or
other to do to some degree with slowing the expansion, there are,
in contrast, some very hard facts that almost certainly have much
to do with bringing on that condition.
   Debt, for example. Not just consumer debt, but municipal debt,
state debt, federal debt, corporate debt. As any householder can
attest, debt can keep things moving just as certainly as if it were
income. But then comes the limit.
   Big spender that it is, Washington seems to be calling for a
halt. The Fed very definitely is. Many households have imposed
their own limits. Banks suddenly seem appalled at their own lending
practices and are calling in loans.
   Then there is corporate debt, alpine dimensions of it. Like
others, corporations can haul around a debt burden for a long time,
expecting all the while that improving conditions will allow them
to begin cutting it.
   When that doesn't happen, and when demand for products slows,
and when interest rates remain high instead of falling, as they had
anticipated, then the burden becomes onerous _ and then more so as
the slowdown continues.
   The debt burden of corporate American soared in the 1980s to
about 67 percent of gross national product from 47 percent in 1970.
The ratio of interest expense to corporate earnings more than
doubled to 40 percent.
   While the percentages might surprise, the reasons why might not.
Junk bonds, after all, are familiar to everyone these days. Before
them, most corporate takeovers, mergers and leveraged buyouts
involved bundles of debt.
   In the late 1980s, about half of all funds raised by
nonfinancial companies were borrowed. Compare that with the two
previous decades, when three-quarters of all money raised by
America's companies was in the form of equity.
   There are many big differences between debt and equity, and one
of them is that holders of corporate equity don't threaten when
there's a recession. They might sell their shares, but many will
hold steady until the skies brighten.
   Those who lend money do not have that same commitment. They want
their loans repaid, and they don't want to hear about the bad
weather or poor sales or the company's need to spend on machinery.
   No excuses, please. Just pay the bill, with interest.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed early today
on the Chicago Board of Trade as pre-weekend trading maneuvers
appeared to steady the markets' recent slide.
   Soybean futures were mostly higher after three straight days of
losses, including drops of as much as 15\ cents a bushel on
Thursday.
   Corn futures also have fallen sharply in recent days but were
narrowly mixed early in today's session.
   In addition to evening their positions, some traders bought in
response to Thursday's weekly Agriculture Department report on
export sales of U.S. grains. The report showed increases over last
year in sales of wheat, corn and soybeans.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.31{ a bushel;
corn was 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with July at $2.85} a
bushel; oats were { cent to 1\ cents lower with July at $1.40 a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with July at
$5.93 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, extending Thursday's losses.
Selling interest again was centered in the pork complex.
   Live cattle futures were .35 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
June at 76.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .27
cent lower with August at 84.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .05

   Donald Trump begins his best-selling guide to
entrepreneurial success, ``The Art of the Deal,'' by declaring: ``I
don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than I'll
ever need.''
   The same man lately has been telling a parade of bankers to his
Trump Tower office in midtown Manhattan that money _ about $100
million _ was precisely what he needed.
   After a decade of buying hotels, casinos, aircraft and land, a
decade in which Trump came to personify the rich braggart and
shameless self-promoter, he's been slowed down by simple math; he's
taking in less than he needs to finance his debts _ $770,000 a week
less, according to Forbes magazine.
   The bankers seem willing to help Trump, but _ given a drop in
the value of the 44-year-old developer's Manhattan real estate and
in the tenuous revenue projections from his Atlantic City casinos _
not entirely on his terms.
   Trump had to put up new collateral and ``he's trying to sell the
yacht, the plane and the helicopters,'' said a source familiar with
Trump's affairs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``You
know, the smaller assets.''
   His situation worsened by the end of last week, when he missed a
payment on bonds used to finance one casino and reportedly faced
growing reluctance by some key lenders over granting him at least
$60 million in additional credit.
   Whatever its resolution, Trump's cash crunch threatens his
prized ability to control his empire, do his deals, indulge in his
extravagances.
   Above all, it has weakened his most impressive edifice _ his
legend, which lured tourists to his hotels, gamblers to his
casinos, celebrities to his Manhattan apartment towers. It may even
have led bankers to give too much credit for his own good.
   ``People tend to be mesmerized by his personality and his
attitude and his record,'' says Benjamin Schore, real estate
professor at Columbia University's business school. ``Sure, bankers
are affected by it. They're human.''
   The story of Donald J. Trump has been told many times, often by
Donald J. Trump: How he dreamed of expanding his father's real
estate business; how he obtained tax breaks and built the Grand
Hyatt Hotel when no one else was building anything in Manhattan;
how he snapped up the site for Trump Tower; how he wore burgundy
suits.
   Whatever his taste, young Trump was by most accounts a
single-minded, hard-working developer. Unlike some older and more
successful competitors, he wasn't afraid to get his patent leather
shoes _ which matched his suits _ dirty at construction sites.
   Trump also developed a reputation for hiring the best people and
paying them accordingly, and for financing his projects by taking
on partners.
   He put his name on everything he built or bought. ``The name
sells,'' Trump once said. ``It's all a game, really.''
   In the mid-1980s bargains became more scarce, and Trump
increasingly paid top prices to buy and fix whatever he wanted,
including the Plaza Hotel, the Eastern Airlines shuttle service and
the unfinished Taj Mahal casino.
   Trump operated on two assumptions: that the New York real estate
he owned got more valuable by the day, and that any other
acquisitions would soar in value if adorned with his name.
   Banks happily helped. When Trump bought what became the Trump's
Castle casino from Hilton Hotels, a group of banks lent him the
down payment and gave him a five-year grace period for the first
repayment.
   ``Bankers have all this money coming in. They've got to get it
out (in loans) and they've got to get it back,'' said Schore,
explaining why banks such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan loaned to
Trump so eagerly.
   What Trump calls ``the beat up Trump months'' began in February
because of a dispute with his wife, not his bankers. Donald and
Ivana Trump were breaking up. Mrs. Trump's determination to seek a
large share of her husband's assets focused attention on their real
worth.
   Trump kept a straight face, even when he scrapped free coffee on
the Trump Shuttle and announced it was for sale, a year after he
bought it. ``Cash is king'' he announced, explaining that he wanted
to be able to grab bargains as prices dropped.
   Then Forbes magazine reported Trump's worth, which it had
estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, had sagged to about $500 million.
   Publicly, Trump was ridiculing the article; privately, he was
calling bankers for more cash. His problem became clearer two weeks
ago, when banking sources confirmed he was conferring with lenders
who wanted more collateral.
   New York tabloids covered that story like they did Trump's
marital mess. The newly opened Taj Mahal, which Trump had touted as
`the eighth wonder of the world'' was called the ``eighth blunder
of the world.''
   Trump's denunciations of others for his problems betrayed the
strain he faced. When a brokerage analyst questioned Trump's Taj
revenue projections, he threatened to sue the brokerage. The
analyst was fired. When reporters asked him about disappointing
shuttle and casino revenues, he blamed employees, including two
respected casino executives who had died in a helicopter crash.
   Trump's reputation for commanding staff loyalty also suffered
with the resignation of Jack O'Donnell, president of the Trump
Plaza casino, who said he was sick of Trump's interference.
   For example, O'Donnell said, one weekend in May Trump stalked a
baccarat pit, watching a Japanese gambler who had won more than $6
million in February. The gambler eventually lost $10 million, and
Trump cut him off before he had a chance to recover. The guest
stormed off to another casino.
   In a business where you're never supposed to ``sweat the
action,'' Trump's behavior reflected inexperience, O'Donnell said.
   Trump's attitude toward wealthy Japanese emerged as another
liability that some said could haunt him. In his heyday Trump would
blast the Japanese as economic exploiters; the next minute he'd say
their desire for Manhattan real estate made his own properties
extremely valuable.
   But now, weary of Japan-bashing by Trump and others, Japanese
investors are increasingly reluctant to buy well-known American
properties. This has narrowed the field of affluent buyers whom
Trump may need some day.
   Trump is by no means finished _ especially if the Taj Mahal
meets his expectations. Nor is he the only developer under pressure
in the economically depressed Northeast.
   ``Trump is going to be in exceptionally good company,'' predicts
Michael Cohen, a real estate expert.
   ``Most of the developers and bankers in New York were too
confident,'' says Schore. ``They felt that even if they did make a
mistake, they'd be bailed out by the rising market. They forgot
about cycles.''
   Will Trump survive? ``If I had to bet, I'd bet on him,'' says
Schore. ``He's a very skilled developer, and hopefully this will
teach him to avoid too much financing.''
   But as he tries to extricate himself by selling, stalling or
renegotiating, Trump must face a reality he described in ``The Art
of the Deal:'' ``The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is
seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood,
and then you're dead.''

<HEAD>Pathe Extends MGM-UA Tender Offer Again as Deadline Looms</HEAD>

   Pathe Communications Corp., still
trying to -arrange financing for its $1.2 billion bid for MGM-UA
Communications Co., today extended its tender offer to June 22, one
day before the deal's final deadline.
   It was the second week-long extension of the offer by Pathe, a
producer and distributor of movies controlled by Italian financier
Giancarlo Paretti. Parretti earlier had extended the deadline until
Friday.
   Whether and how Parretti can finance the deal has been the
subject of tremendous speculation. He previously tried and failed
to buy smaller Hollywood companies. The offer expires on June 23,
according to his agreement with MGM-UA and Tracinda Corp., the
holding company through which Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk
Kerkorian controls MGM-UA.
   Last year, a bid by the Qintex group in Australia to buy MGM-UA
for $1.5 billion fell through for lack of financing. Qintex outbid
media mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose financing seemed assured, by $100
million, but was unable to finance the deal.
   MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow, who Kerkorian has promised a
$30 million bonus when MGM-UA is sold, declined to say if Kerkorian
would retain a 2 percent stake in MGM-UA. Kerkorian, in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has indicated he may
do so. That would reduce Parretti's price by about $20 million.
   Jeanne Ouellette, an MGM-UA spokeswoman, said she wasn't sure
about Kerkorian retaining a stake in the company, but said the deal
was expected to go through even if it comes down to the final
deadline.
   ``The outside date has always been the 23rd,'' she said.
   Parretti has paid $200 million in cash down payments. He also
has guaranteed MGM-UA $75 million in fees from distributing three
upcoming Pathe releases, including ``The Russia House'' with Sean
Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer and ``Quigley Down Under'' with Tom
Selleck.
   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to lend Parretti $650 million in
return for a lien on the United Artists film library and
distribution rights on that library and new MGM, Pathe and United
Artists films for 20 years.
   The balance of the offer is expected to be funded by short-term
loans and asset sales by Pathe-affiliated companies in Europe, and
the possible resale of MGM-UA stock or of new Pathe shares after
the merger.

with 37 years experience when a management change forced him to
retire from the board of Gates Rubber Co., a manufacturer of belts
and hoses.
   Within six months, Ewy was dead of a heart attack. His son
Rodger said he died of a broken heart, caused by forced departure
from the Denver company that put him out to pasture like an aging
racehorse.
   Some medical experts have a different term for this _ early
executive mortality.
   ``Men are dying not with their boots on, but with their
retirement plans clutched in their hands,'' said Dr. Alan Sherman,
a Palo Alto, Calif., psychiatrist who has studied post-retirement
executive deaths.
   G. Dale Meyer, an assistant business professor at the University
of Colorado, is directing a study commissioned by Mutual Benefit
Life Insurance Co. to determine if executives forced into
retirement tend to die soon after losing power. Meyer's team, which
includes physicians, has just begun working.
   ``We're trying to see if this is folklore, or if it's real,''
Meyer said.
   A number of businessmen say it's real.
   Justin Dart, creator of Dart Industries, issued a statement when
he was 72: ``I want my death and my retirement to be simultaneous.''
   Three years later in 1980, he merged his corporation with Kraft
Inc. and died.
   Armand Hammer, 92, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
William C. Norris, 78, founder of Control Data Corp., and J. Peter
Grace, 77, chairman of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., are all among top
executives who refused to retire rather than relinquish power.
Norris stepped down as chairman of his company four years ago but
remains a powerful board member.
   ``A time arrives when, for a variety of possible reasons, the
successful entrepreneur thinks retirement. Yet being an
entrepreneur, this individual can't fathom the traditional meaning
of the term retirement,'' Meyer said.
   ``Nothing, absolutely nothing, in this individual's view of the
world relates to the retirement concept.
   ``Bureaucrats and corpocrats, the corporate equivalent of
bureaucrat, place comfortable retirement as a high priority
throughout their careers. They look forward to doing nothing...they
dream of travel, golf, fishing, dilettantism and perhaps a hobby,''
said Meyer.
   ``This is not to say that all who eagerly anticipate retirement
do it well. Increasingly, the emptiness of it all, the unstructured
meaningless, the loss of vital interests, is being viewed more
negatively. The loss of purpose, it is now known, can create early
illness and even death,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, early executive mortality remains a medically
undocumented syndrome. Although anecdotal examples of premature
deaths after retirement have been chronicled, there are plenty of
executives who survive and thrive after getting out of the
workaholic rat-race while relatively young.
   Perhaps the best-known recent instance is that of Peter Lynch,
46, the widely respected manager of the highly profitable Magellan
mutual fund of Fidelity Investments in Boston. After 13 years of
running the fund, he called it quits last month to spend more time
with his family.
   Still, Lynch's story does not reflect a more common occurence:
executives who are pushed into retirement before they're ready.
Their numbers have been growing in recent years, partly because of
the restructurings, mergers and staff reductions that have reshaped
much of American business.
   Moreover, few companies teach potential retirees for a second
career that might extend their useful life.
   Henry Kates, chief executive of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance,
had more than a corporate interest in doing something about it.
   Kates was sitting in a conference room at a Phoenix hotel in
1979 when William T. Earls, a 69-year-old company field manager and
good friend, rose to give his retirement presentation. Midway
through, Earls died of a heart attack.
   In the years that followed, five more of his senior managers
died soon after retirement.
   Mary Ann Green, a spokesman for the insurance company, said the
study was commissioned to determine how companies could better
prepare managers for retirement. She said it has nothing to do with
insurance or insurance rates.
   ``Our CEO felt not enough was being done to help these people
who had contributed so much to the company,'' she said. ``He
believes most corporations aren't aware of this problem.''
   Meyer said he plans to contact the Fortune 500 companies to ask
them for statistical figures on executives who retired successfully
and found second careers or occupations, vs. those who did not and
died early.
   He said preliminary research suggests a second career may be
crucial to former executives.
   ``Those who do not find that second challenge, a second start,
are in great danger of dying sooner than their cohorts,'' he said.

   Stock prices drifted lower today as the market
absorbed the impact of a quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.43 to 2,920.79
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 486 up, 887 down and
547 unchanged.
   The government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.2
percent in May, not far from most advance estimates.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said the nation's trade
deficit shrank to $6.94 billion last month from $8.45 billion in
April, registering a larger-than-expected decline.
   But analysts said it was hard to gauge investors' reactions to
either of those developments in the midst of the witching hour,
involving a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   As the process began of settling multiple transactions involving
those contracts and individual stocks, a preponderance of sell
orders showed up in a good many blue-chip issues.
   Losers among the volume leaders included Exxon, down &rsqb; at 47};
Philip Morris, down { at 43~; Ford Motor, down | at 45}, and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down &lsqb; at 42\.
   Walt Disney climbed 2~ to 131~ amid intense notice for the
opening of the company's movie ``Dick Tracy.''
   Elsewhere, battered gold-mining stocks staged a modest rally.
ASA Ltd. gained ~ to 43~; Homestake Mining { to 16\, and Newmont
Gold 1&rsqb; to 38.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.73 to 197.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .41 at 363.89.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 134.94 million shares with two

<HEAD>Increasing Competition Spurs Plans for Off-Hours Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange's decision to phase
in 24-hour securities trading during the 1990s comes amid
intensifying worldwide competition that is eroding the Big Board's
market share.
   Regional stock exchanges, foreign markets and independent
electronic services offering cheaper trading are offering investors
alternatives for trading NYSE stocks.
   Meanwhile, other exchanges and private services are offering
off-hours trading in the rush to capitalize on new technology that
lets investors trade securities almost whenever and wherever they
want.
   ``Anyplace else where you can trade securities represents
competition,'' John W. Bachman, managing partner of the St. Louis
brokerage Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., said Friday.
   ``If the New York Stock Exchange is determined to remain what
many people believe is the strongest market in the world, they
can't ignore it,'' he said.
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. on Thursday unveiled a
five-step plan to trade securities after the exchange's traditional
daytime hours. The plan would culminate in 24-hour trading by the
end of the decade.
   Round-the-clock trading already is reality in the foreign
currency and U.S. Treasury bond markets, where dealers conduct
transactions via telephone and computer links. The two Chicago
futures markets plan to begin computerized, extended-hours trading
in November.
   While the NYSE remains by far the nation's largest exchange _
and the world's second-largest behind Tokyo _ its market share has
eroded and profitability slumped in recent years.
   The Big Board handled only 69.2 percent of all trades in its
listed stocks last year, an all-time low. The exchange's net income
fell to $6.29 million last year from $10.45 million in 1988.
   The NYSE still dominates the volume of trades, but it has lost
significant market share to smaller regional exchanges. The
Chicago-based Midwest Stock Exchange, for example, last year
accounted for 10.3 percent of the trading in NYSE stocks, up from
3.33 percent in 1979.
   Industry experts also say erosion has occurred overseas, where
U.S. companies are listed on foreign exchanges.
   The London exchange, which went electronic four years ago, and
the Tokyo market have siphoned the most business. In London, the
value of trading of U.S. securities totaled the equivalent of about
$2.5 billion in May.
   Another and possibly bigger threat to the NYSE is the so-called
``third market'' of firms that trade stocks off of the exchange
floor. The Big Board is concerned that its large member firms could
shift some of their business to off-exchange trading.
   The third market's share of NYSE-listed stock trades rose to 7.4
percent of overall Big Board trading through May this year from 3.1
percent in the same 1989 period. By skirting the NYSE floor, third
market firms offer a cheaper and more anonymous way to conduct
trades.
   This electronic alternative to the Big Board includes
off-exchange firms such as Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities,
which can handle trades in 275 of the NYSE's 1,700 listed
securities; the electronic trading system Instinet; and Crossing
Network, an after-hours system that matches up trades.
   The fully automated National Association of Securities Dealers
plans to start trading up to 300 over-the-counter stocks starting
at 4 a.m. in September, a direct challenge to the London Stock
Exchange.
   And the American Stock Exchange said that on Monday it would
outline a joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
the Cincinnati Stock Exchange and the financial information company
Reuters for trading stocks and options and unregistered securities
electronically around the world.
   How can the 198-year-old NYSE guarantee its future?
   Eric K. Clemons, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School, said the Big Board has to ``make sure institutions
feel they have no choice, that if they want to trade a (major U.S.)
stock, the only place to trade is New York.''
   Meanwhile, NYSE competitors and other exchanges welcomed
Phelan's proposal to gear up for 24-hour trading.
   The steps would begin later this year with two brief sessions
after the market's normal close. Subsequent phases would involve
stock auctions held several times a night, some form of
conventional trading overnight and finally 24-hour dealing.
   Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
said the NYSE moves would help develop an underlying cash market in
stocks on a 24-hour basis that would add liquidity for futures and
options trading.
   ``It will increase the awareness and attract greater liquidity
to off-hours trading,'' said Linda R. Coleman, executive vice
president of Instinet, which is owned by Reuters Holdings PLC.
``That can only benefit us because it will atrract more trading to
our order-flow system.''
   Third-market leader Bernad Madoff said the increased competition
faced by the NYSE is a healthy byproduct of a changing financial
world.
   ``Their concern is not necessarily the concern of the rest of
the industry,'' Madoff said. ``Like any business, their loss has
been someone else's gain.''

<HEAD>Court Ruling Backs Discounts for Cash Customers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high court judge on Friday backed the
government's plan to permit retailers to charge cash customers less
than those who use credit cards.
   Justice Derek Hodgson rejected a suit filed by the credit card
company Visa International, which sought an order blocking the
government's proposed action.
   Visa International said Britain would be the first country in
Europe to permit differential pricing.
   ``The real decision is going to be made in the marketplace. We
think that is the most important,'' said a spokeswoman for Visa
International, speaking on condition that she not be identified.
   However, she said the company had not reviewed all the legal
papers and had not ruled out a further appeal.
   The government decided to introduce the two-tiered system after
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission decided last August that Visa
and its member banks were part of a complex monopoly.
   An existing ``no discrimination'' rule, which bans traders who
accept Visa cards from imposing any surcharge on transactions,
operated against the public interest, the commission said.
   Visa has more than 21,000 member banks and mortgage lenders
worldwide.
   Bernard Hughes, a spokesman for the Retail Consortium, which
represents 90 percent of the British retail industry, welcomed the
judge's ruling.
   ``We hope it will clarify the situation and that Visa will end
its objections,'' he said.

<HEAD>From Neon Visors to Corn Cob Litter: Pet Items Extravagant,
Functional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cat litter that transforms waste into a
disposable rock seems like a good idea, although the neon doggie
sun visors appear flamboyant enough to make Lassie blush.
   From functional to extravagant, a wide array of pet products is
on display through Saturday at the industry's annual trade show in
Atlanta.
   Is your pet unhappy because it cannot show the world which NFL
team is its favorite? Maybe it would like a dog sweater, leash or
dinner bowl emblazoned with the San Francisco 49ers logo. Or
perhaps a replica helmet bird feeder.
   Has your hamster become bored in its old-fashioned cage? Put
them into a new, multicolored modular model with a looping overhead
plastic walkway.
   Are the goldfish uncomfortable in their little bowl? Try an
acrylic designer aquarium-coffee table.
   Among the 485 exhibit booths at the American Pet Products
Manufacturers Association show are myriad makers of pet foods,
animal litter, bird cages and other standard pet store fare.
   Karen Long MacLeod, editor of the trade publication Pet Age,
said the offbeat items aren't as frivolous as they may seem.
   A major thrust of the industry, she said, is to provide products
that make pets more a part of the family, rather than just passive
creatures.
   ``It's important to get kids and adults to think about their
pets and bring them into the family, not just look at them as
disposable things,'' Ms. MacLeod said. ``Those products are
designed to keep pets healthy and to have fun.''
   Particularly in the areas of food and litter, the industry is
very research driven, she said.
   ``It's a pretty healthy industry,'' Ms. MacLeod said. ``We see
it in the number of new companies entering the industry and staying
in, and in shows like these. An industry that's stagnant wouldn't
be doing it.''
   Judging from the number of exhibitors featuring litter, keeping
pets sanitary isn't simple. Several companies are offering a
solidifying clay litter that has been developed over the last few
years.
   When a cat wets this litter, the clay coagulates into a hardened
ball that can be scooped out and disposed of. The powdery litter
comes in a jug and the pet owner simply adds more to the box as the
old portions are discarded.
   ``You don't ever dump it. It's used up,'' said Mike Bennett, a
sales representative for Sanex Corp. of Houston, whose litter is
called Better Way.
   A few booths away, Mounds, Ill.-based Absorbent Clay Products
was displaying its version of the solidifying litter, which is
aimed at affluent consumers.
   ``It's a superior clumper _ no doubt about it,'' said Ed Odom,
Absorbent's vice president of research.
   There's more than one way to keep pets clean. Bed-O' Cobs, a
Maumee, Ohio, maker of corn cob litter, was displaying its product,
which the company says is best for bird cages and small animals.
   Cedar is the most widely used bedding for small animals, but
corn cob is catching on, said Ted Weaver, Bed-O' Cobs' product
manager. Unlike other materials, corn cob absorbs moisture from the
bottom up, keeping the surface near the animal drier, he said.

   Developer Donald Trump announced he will not
make payments due today to holders of Trump Castle casino's junk
bonds.
   Trump was due to make principal and interest payments of about
$30 million on the bonds used to finance the Atlantic City hotel
and casino.
   He has a 10-day grace period to make the payment following
today's scheduled due date, bankers have said.
   The brief announcement from Trump said negotiations with banks
are continuing. Trump has been talking with his bank lenders, whom
he owes about $2 billion, and had reached a tentative agreement for
$60 million in new loans earlier this week.
   The agreement has been said to be in jeopardy as other bank
lenders have balked at the arrangement that would have given them
equity in some of Trump's properties in return for the loan and a
suspension of payments.
   The Trump Organization said an interest payment due today on
Trump Plaza bonds had been made and a May 15 interest payment on
Taj Mahal was paid.
   Trump spokeswoman Norma Foerderer said the company would have no
further comment beyond the news release.
   In reaction to the announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
lowered its rating on Trump's Taj Mahal bonds and Plaza bonds. Bids
for Trump Castle bonds were off about 2 cents, trading at 56 cents
on the dollar, and bids for Taj Mahal bonds were steady around 79
cents on the dollar. John Moran, a bond trader at Advest Inc., said
bids had gone lower shortly after the announcement, but he doubted
there were any takers.
   Bids for bonds on the healthiest of Trump's three casinos, the
Trump Plaza, were trading in a narrow range in the low to mid 50s,
Moran said.
   Trump's once gleaming image as a booming developer with a Midas
touch has been tarnished by the slumping New York city real estate
market and disappointing results from his Atlantic City casinos.
   As trustee for the Castle bonds, First Fidelity Bancorp, of
Newark N.J., oversees the interests of bondholders. The bank has
also loaned Trump $75 million. Paul Levine, spokesman for First
Fidelity, said the bank would have no comment on the announcement.
   Trump's major bank lenders, Citicorp, Bankers Trust Corp. of New
York, Chase Manhattan Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Bank had
reached an agreement with the flamboyant developer earlier this
week. However, other banks needed to complete the deal were
reportedly hesitant.
   Among those were First Fidelity and Midlantic Banks Inc., of
Edison, N.J., according to a report in this morning's editions of
The New York Times.
   Some bankers suggested bondholders might scrutinize the role of
First Fidelity as both bond trustee and major lender if he fails to
make the payment, the Times reported.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately to sharply lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade,
in active selling that occurred late in an otherwise lackluster
session.
   Forecasts for near-ideal weather conditions in the Midwest
through mid-July have weighed on corn and soybean prices all week.
Late in Friday's session, prices of both commodities fell low
enough to trigger substantial new selling.
   The significant marks were $2.75 a bushel in the December corn
contract and $5.88 in the July beans, said Victor Lespinasse, an
assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``Yesterday, we held those support levels,'' he said. ``But late
today, renewed selling pushed the market down through those levels
and we just collapsed.''
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.28 a bushel; corn was 4 cents
to 7 cents lower with July at $2.83 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 2{ cents lower with July at $1.38{ a bushel; and soybeans were 9
cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $5.85 a bushel.

<HEAD>Largest Gold Producers to Curtail Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's two largest gold
producing companies announced curtailment of their mining
operations Friday due to the plummeting price of gold.
   Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said two of its mining
companies, Free State State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. (Freegold)
and Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Co. Ltd., would cut back on
operations in moves that will cut at least 7,800 jobs.
   Earlier this week, two other mining groups outside the
Anglo-American conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1,100
workers.
   The price of gold reached a 4-year low of $346.25 per ounce in
New York and London before recovering on Thursday. Gold is South
Africa's major industry, earning more than half the country's
foreign currency.
   Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo-American's gold and
uranium division, said the company in recent months had tried
several programs to maintain existing operating levels, including
cost reduction measures and deferment of capital expenditure.
   ``Despite these efforts, at current gold prices and operating
costs, certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining
operations at their present levels,'' Hewitt said.
   He said the curtailment of operations would take place over the
next nine months and probably result in the loss of 7,800 jobs at
Freegold. He said reductions at Vaal Reefs would not necessarily
eliminate jobs because workers may be assigned to other areas of
the mine.
   Operating reductions at Freegold would reduce its gold
production by less than 1 percent, while the proposed action at
Vaal Reefs likely would improve production, Hewitt said.
   On Wednesday, General Mining Union Corp. announced its
marginally operating Stilfontein Gold Mining Co. Ltd. would lay off
500 workers immediately to cut costs in the face of low gold
prices. Anglovaal Ltd. said its Loraine Gold Mines Ltd. would lay
off 600 workers and reduce production by 10 percent in the next
four months.
   Hewitt said Anglo American management had invited discussions
with union leaders about the curtailments. There was no immediate
reaction from the unions.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the nations' largest black
union, representing some 250,000 black miners, has already declared
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations
with the mining industry body.
   Curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step. Once
a particular shaft is shut down, the infrastructure often
deteriorates rapidly, making it even more costly and dangerous to
resume operations when the price of gold rises.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower In U.S., Mixed In Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground in domestic dealings and
finished mixed in Europe in volatile trading Friday following the
release of a flurry of U.S. economic data.
   Gold prices advanced but were unable to recover from Thursday's
$5-an-ounce selloff.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $349.50 a troy ounce, up $2.70 from late
Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $348.50 an ounce, up $2.65 an ounce.
   The government reported that the nation's trade deficit shrunk
dramatically to $6.94 billion in April and that consumer inflation
held to a modest 0.2 percent gain in May. Both reports were in line
with expectations and had little impact on currency dealings.
   But a Federal Reserve report showing a 0.6 percent rebound in
May's industrial production took the market by surprise.
   ``This was the first time in several weeks that an economic
number was reported actually stronger than the market had
expected,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in
Chicago.
   The dollar initially rallied, both in Europe and the United
States, on the notion that the Federal Reserve won't be inclined to
lower interest rates to stimulate production. Lower interest rates
make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
   But a bout of profit-taking swept European markets, where the
dollar closed lower against most currencies, and carried through to
U.S. dealings.
   Activity was ``very heavy and very choppy,'' said Stephen
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Rumors circulated in the market that West Germany's Bundesbank
and the Bank of Japan are poised to intervene in coming days to
support their local currencies _ at the expense of the dollar.
   ``With the idea that the central banks might act to limit
further dollar gains, many wanted to take profits ahead of the
weekend,'' Chandler said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.52 yen, up 0.99 yen from
Thursday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 154.10
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 153.90 yen, down from 154.20
yen on Thursday.
   In London the pound fell to $1.7060, from $1.7080 late Thursday.
In New York it cost $1.7090 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Thursday's $1.7080.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6885 West German marks, down from
1.6948; 1.4330 Swiss francs, down from 1.4355; 5.6806 French
francs, down from 5.7015; 1,239.00 Italian lire, down from
1,244.50, and 1.1709 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1713.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6915 West German marks, down from 1.6920; 1.4340
Swiss francs, up from 1.4330; 5.6910 French francs, down from
5.6940; 1.9065 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9045; 1,241.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,242.75; and 1.1698 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1700.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. In London, gold traded at a late
bid price of $347.50 per troy ounce, up from $345.25 late Thursday.
In Zurich, the metal was quoted at $347.25 an ounce, up from
$345.50. In Hong Kong, gold slipped to $346.75 an ounce from
$348.95.
   Silver prices were unchanged to higher. On New York's Comex,
silver for current delivery settled at $4.811 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $4.770. In London, silver traded at a late bid price of
$4.80 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday.

   Oil prices fell Friday due to oversupply, as
well as the approach of a contract expiration, analysts said.
   The contract for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 51 cents to $16.62 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercentile Exchange. Later
contract months posted smaller losses. The price of the July
contract had fallen 45 cents Thursday.
   ``I think that the problem with the crude market is the high
level of crude stocks,'' said William Byers, an analyst at Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co., who said the price decline also was connected to
next Wednesday's deadline for trading the July contract.
   ``Nobody wants it, since they're basically awash in crude oil,''
he said.
   The market saw a corresponding drop in home heating oil, with
the July contract off 0.13 cent to 48.37 cents a gallon. Heating
oil was off 0.07 cent the day before.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 1.39 cents a
gallon to 61.51 cents. The contract had risen 1.27 cents the day
before. Subsequent months were mixed. Byers said prices have been
up because this is motorists' peak driving period.
   Prices for natural gas were mixed, with the July contract
unchanged from $1.547 per 1,000 cubic feet. The August and
September contracts were down while October and November were up.

   The Dow Jones industrial average inched up to
close at a new high Friday, the third record-setting session this
month.
   The key index advanced 7.67 points to finish the week at
2,935.89, surpassing its previous closing peak of 2,935.19 reached
June 4. Volume totaled 205.13 million shares, up from 135.77
million on Thursday.
   Though the Dow reached a new high, overall stock prices were
mixed as the market absorbed the impact of a quarterly ``triple

government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent
in May, not far from most advance estimates, and a larger-than
expected decline in the nation's trade deficit, which registered
$6.94 billion in April.
   Analysts said it was hard to gauge investors' reactions to

the simultaneous expiration of a series of options and futures on

<HEAD>New Jersey Says Allstate Lawsuit Not a Federal Matter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials asked a federal judge Friday
to relinquish jurisdiction in a lawsuit filed by Allstate Insurance
Co. that claims New Jersey's new automobile insurance law is
unconstitutional.
   Douglas Eakeley, first assistant state attorney general, said
U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell should abstain from considering
Allstate's grievances because the same case can be litigated
properly at the state level.
   Allstate, New Jersey's largest insurer, says the state's new law
violates the company's rights under the Fifth and 14th Amendments
because the law unfairly forces the insurance industry to pay $1.4
billion to the state high-risk insurance pool.
   Part of the Fifth Amendment says the government cannot take
private property without just compensation, and the 14th Amendment
upholds a right to challenge governmental actions.
   Bissell reserved decision on the matter.
   Earlier, Bissell refused a request by the Liberty Mutual
Insurance Group and Continental Insurance Co. of New Jersey to move
cases being handled at the state administrative level to the
federal level.
   Liberty also has a separate federal case pending that seeks to
block the insurance law. State Farm Insurance Co. is seeking the
same action in state Superior Court.
   The state's 15 insurance servicing carriers, including Allstate,
Liberty, State Farm and Continental, are named in a state lawsuit
claiming they overbilled the state-run Joint Underwriting
Association. The case is being handled by an administrative law
judge.
   The insurance law requires the industry to pay the $1.4 billion
during the next seven years to help eliminate a $3.1 billion debt
amassed by the JUA pool for high-risk drivers. The JUA, which costs
every New Jersey motorist $222 per car on their annual policy, is
to be eliminated under the law.
   New Jersey's car insurance rates are among the nation's highest.
   Floyd Abrams, a prominent constitutional lawyer representing
Allstate, argued Friday that under the federal Tax Injunction Act,
the state should not be allowed to collect surcharges and other
assessments from the company in the form of a tax.
   ``This is a segregated fund which is applied only for the single
purpose of paying off the JUA debt,'' Abrams told Bissell. ``We
think that based on case law ... that neither the assessment nor
surcharge is a tax. We believe it is paying a private debt.''
   Eakeley responded that the surcharge every motorist pays because
of the JUA losses are ``hardly a private debt.''
   Gov. Jim Florio, who signed the insurance law March 12, has
maintained that the insurance industry financially benefited from
the JUA and contributed to its financial woes. Florio said there
are provisions in the law that ensure auto insurance companies can
make a fair profit.

   For the week the average posted a gain of 73.51 points.

<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. said Friday it was pleased by Iran's
agreement to pay $600 million for Amoco facilities that were seized
during the Islamic revolution, but that the effect on earnings
would be lowered by taxes and an unrelated charge.
   The company said it expects to recognize the all-cash settlement
in its second-quarter results, provided it receives the money by
the end of June.
   Amoco said in a statement from its Chicago headquarters that the
effect of the settlement on net income will be ``largely offset''
by the as-yet undetermined income taxes it must pay on it, and by
an unrelated charge the company will take against the cost of
future environmental clean-ups.
   Spokesman Mike Thompson indicated the taxes and clean-up
provision would total more than $300 million. In addition, a
statuatory fee of about $6 million will be deducted by the U.S.
government, the company said.
   Amoco stock rose 25 cents a share to close at $52.12{ Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The settlement was the largest in the history of the
Netherlands-based Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, an
arbitration body set up in 1980 to mediate financial claims.
   ``We have been discussing things with the Iranians and we were
pleased to reach the settlement,'' Thompson said.
   The case had been in the tribunal for nine years, said Thompson,
adding that without Friday's agreement, it could have dragged on
for several more years.
   Two Amoco subsidiaries had filed claims against the National
Iranian Oil Company.
   Under terms of the agreement, Amoco Iran Oil Co. will receive
$540 million for the 1979 seizure of four Persian Gulf drilling
fields and the oil terminal on Kharg island, Iran's most important
oil terminal.
   Amoco International Finance Corp. was awarded $60 million for
the expropriation of a petrochemical processing plant in which
Amoco had a half-interest.

<TEXT>
   The world's two largest gold
producing companies announced curtailment of their mining
operations Friday due to the plummeting price of gold.
   Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said two of its mining
companies, Free State State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. (Freegold)
and Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Co. Ltd., would cut back on
operations in moves that will cut at least 7,800 jobs.
   Earlier this week, two other mining groups outside the
Anglo-American conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1,100
workers.
   The price of gold reached a 4-year low of $346.25 per ounce in
New York and London before recovering on Thursday. Gold is South
Africa's major industry, earning more than half the country's
foreign currency.
   Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo-American's gold and
uranium division, said the company in recent months had tried
several programs to maintain existing operating levels, including
cost reduction measures and deferment of capital expenditure.
   ``Despite these efforts, at current gold prices and operating
costs, certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining
operations at their present levels,'' Hewitt said.
   He said the curtailment of operations would take place over the
next nine months and probably result in the loss of 7,800 jobs at
Freegold. He said reductions at Vaal Reefs would not necessarily
eliminate jobs because workers may be assigned to other areas of
the mine.
   Operating reductions at Freegold would reduce its gold
production by less than 1 percent, while the proposed action at
Vaal Reefs likely would improve production, Hewitt said.
   On Wednesday, General Mining Union Corp. announced its
marginally operating Stilfontein Gold Mining Co. Ltd. would lay off
500 workers immediately to cut costs in the face of low gold
prices. Anglovaal Ltd. said its Loraine Gold Mines Ltd. would lay
off 600 workers and reduce production by 10 percent in the next
four months.
   Hewitt said Anglo American management had invited discussions
with union leaders about the curtailments. There was no immediate
reaction from the unions.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the nations' largest black
union, representing some 250,000 black miners, has already declared
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations
with the mining industry body.
   Curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step. Once
a particular shaft is shut down, the infrastructure often
deteriorates rapidly, making it even more costly and dangerous to
resume operations when the price of gold rises.

<HEAD>British Stock Market Experts Puzzled by Big Board Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British stock market experts said Friday they were
puzzled by the New York Stock Exchange's plan to begin after-hours
trading to an effort to recapture trading of U.S. stocks now
conducted overseas.
   The experts said such trading is relatively small in Europe, and
it also is not clear that the business will grow much in coming
years.
   But they also said the proposals were too sketchy to determine
their implications.
   One trader, however, was enthusiastic, saying, ``I see this as a
major plus for internationalization.''
   Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. on Thursday unveiled a
five-step plan to phase in a 24-hour market by the end of the
decade to meet increasing competition from overseas.
   The steps would begin with two brief sessions after the New York
market's normal close at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
   Later, stock auctions would be held several times a night,
followed by some form of conventional trading overnight before
24-hour dealing eventually is introduced.
   A spokeswoman for London's Stock Exchange, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British practice, said Thursday, ``We ourselves
have no plans to extend trading hours. However, the exchange
continues to respond to traders' needs.''
   The London exchange in March moved up its session half an hour
to between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., in respone to demand for
earlier trading.
   The London exchange went electronic four years ago under the
sweeping ``Big Bang'' deregulation, which placed the execution of
trades on computer screens. By contrast, the NYSE still executes
trades through the interaction of stock brokers and specialists on
the exchange floor.
   London's specialists are required to continuously make markets
in stocks during the exchange's official hours, but investors are
allowed to buy and sell shares anytime via computer.
   The Big Board's move probably is in response to NASDAQ's plan to
begin operating during European hours in the third quarter of this
year, said Tim Williams, who runs trading in U.S. stocks for the
London investment firm County Natwest Woodmac.
   NASDAQ, or National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations, is an American, screen-based, over-the-counter market.
   ``It's a bit difficult to understand really what they (the Big
Board) are going to accomplish by it,'' Williams said Friday. ``The
fact of the matter is most of the business here is reasonably
small. Whether it can be developed is debatable.''
   The London exchange said the value of trading in U.S. stocks in
London came to the equivalent of about $2.6 billion in May,
representing just 5 percent of the total foreign stock trading of
$50.3 billion.
   About $46.9 billion worth of British stocks were traded that
month, it said.
   Europe's exchanges currently are focusing their attention on
creating a single market for trading European stocks, which
represent 65 percent of foreign stock trading on London's exchange.
   Most trading in U.S. stocks in London is handled by the major
U.S. brokerage firms which have London operations.
   A spokeswoman for one of them, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said, ``We
support the stock exchange initiative which responds to the stock
market environment.''
   Firms that aren't members of the New York exchange can trade
U.S. stocks in Europe without following Big Board regulations.
   ``It's really very difficult to know what the implications are
going to be because they're very sketchy about what they want to
do,'' Williams said about Phelan's plan.
   Investors are unlikely to be willing to wait around for the
appointed time or agree to an auction, he said.
   He also said he didn't think investors would be willing to risk
leaving an overnight order with a broker because a market
development could occur while the investor is asleep.
   He noted that London brokers place overnight orders in Tokyo.
``But we're used to it,'' he said.
   ``I'm no sure there is going to be global trading,'' he added.
   But the enthusiastic London trader, who didn't want to be
identified, said, ``We welcome any kind of competition in Europe.
The freer or open the market is, the better it will be not only for
traders but also for the investment community.''
   He said the Big Board being open during the European morning
probably would generate more European business because it would
``legitimize'' trading in U.S. stocks on this side of the Atlantic.
   Many European traders now only consider a New York price on a
U.S. stock ``legitimate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bonds Tumble on Belief Fed Won't Ease</HEAD>

   Bond prices tumbled Friday on economic reports
that led traders to conclude the Federal Reserve did not plan to
lower short-term interest rates soon.
   In its sharpest one-day drop since mid-April, the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond tumbled 13-16 point, or $8.13 per $1,000 in
face amount.
   Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 8.42 percent
from late Wednesday's 8.34 percent, which was the lowest for the
long-term bond since late January.
   Economists said they were surprised at the sharp drop, which
came despite news on inflation and the federal trade deficit that
normally would give bond prices a boost.
   They attributed the bulk of the decline to a Fed report that
industrial production rebounded an unexpectedly strong 0.6 percent
last month after holding steady in April. The market had expected a
0.3 percent rise.
   Some analysts said the market should have dismissed the gain in
industrial production because it was caused mainly by a buildup in
inventories by the Big Three automakers concerned about a possible
strike.
   Signs of a strong economy tend to weaken bonds, because of
concerns that inflation will rise and erode the value of such
long-term fixed-income investments.
   The Labor Department reported retail prices rose a modest 0.2
percent in May, bringing the rise in the Consumer Price Index for
the first five months of the year to 5.8 percent. That news should
have been favorable for credit markets.
   In addition, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit
shrank to $6.94 billion in April, the second lowest level in the
last 6 years, another positive sign.
   Ray Stone, managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., said the market declined following a financial
wire report citing unnamed Fed officials who reinforced a view they
weren't close to lowering interest rates.
   Traders believed the economy was not weak enough nor inflation
calm enough to trigger an easier monetary policy. Falling interest
rates boost the value of existing bonds because their rates of
return are higher and therefore more valuable.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 3-16 point to 9-32 point, intermediate maturities
fell 13-32 point to { point, and long-term issues fell as much as
13-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.78 to 1,160.55.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.93 percent as the
discount gained 2 basis points to 7.68 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.02 percent as the discount gained 6 basis points to
7.62 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.03 percent as the
discount rose 6 basis points to 7.49 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from
late Wednesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1-16 point to 91}. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.50 percent from 7.49 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Carrier Launches New Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling Eastern Airlines will launch a ``100
days'' advertising campaign aimed at boosting consumer faith in its
service, the airline's court-appointed trustee said Thursday.
   The campaign will hit the airwaves Sunday evening in 33
Eastern-served markets. It features trustee Martin Shugrue
answering questions from employees and promising that service will
improve each day over the 100-day period.
   ``Yes, we have a large, deep hole to climb out of,'' Shugrue
tells workers in one commercial.
   The carrier has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
since a crippling strike that began in March 1989. A bankruptcy
judge appointed Shugrue to run the airline in April after creditors
became frustrated by the management of Eastern's owners, Texas Air
Corp.
   ``I don't think honesty is risky,'' Shugrue told reporters in
unveiling the campaign. ``I don't think candor is risky, although
it can be controversial.''
   The initial commercial, showing Shugrue fielding questions at an
Eastern hangar here, will be followed by an ad showing him talking
with passengers aboard an Eastern flight.
   The multimillion-dollar campaign is the first for Eastern by
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the New York advertising agency that Shugrue hired
in one of his first acts as trustee. He declined to give the
campaign's precise cost.
   The campaign is aimed at driving home Eastern's on-time and
friendly service and ending confusion among consumers, Shugrue said.
   ``We're running a good airline. We're not getting credit for
it,'' he said.
   The airline's May passenger figures were ``horrible,'' he said,
but June has shown an upturn.
   Shugrue said the carrier will recall union pilots based upon
needs, not by seniority as the union has demanded. The pilots union
ended its sympathy strike in support of the Machinists last
November but has discussed returning to the picket lines because of
the recall issue.
   ``I expect pilots who aren't working to return to Eastern and
get going,'' Shugrue said. ``Everybody has to understand the
economics of operating this company.''
   Talks are continuing with the Machinists union, which remains on
strike, he said.
   ``I'm not Pollyannish about it,'' Shugrue said of his pledge to
bring labor peace to Eastern. ``There's too much history on this
property. I am optimistic.''
   Eastern employees applauded enthusiastically while watching
Shugrue's news conference.
   ``I think he has credibility. If anyone can mean long-term
viability and Eastern remaining independent, he can,'' said Dennis
Cirroti, a 24-year Eastern pilot who returned to work last August
after striking.

<HEAD>Inside Trader Siegel Sentenced To Two Months In Prison</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with details from sentencing;

<TEXT>
   Martin A. Siegel, who allegedly took suitcases
filled with cash from Ivan Boesky in exchange for inside
information, was sentenced Friday to two months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward cited Siegel's contrition and
cooperation with prosecutors in giving him one of the shortest
prison terms meted out in Wall Street's insider trading scandals.
   Siegel, a mergers specialist for the investment firms Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., was one of the
first Wall Street figures to cooperate with prosecutors after being
implicated by Boesky, the notorious stock speculator.
   Boesky, in recent testimony in another case, said he gave Siegel
suitcases of cash for inside information on takeover attempts.
Siegel has admitted swapping stock tips with former Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. trader Robert Freeman.
   ``Over the last three and a half years, I have tried to do
everything in my power to make up for these mistakes,'' Siegel said
in a statement to the court. He pleaded guilty in February 1987 to
conspiracy to violate securities laws and tax evasion.
   In addition to the prison time, Siegel was sentenced to five
years probation during which he must perform 3,000 hours of
community service. No fine was given.
   Siegel previously agreed to give up more than $9 million in cash
and assets to settle civil charges brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Ward chided Siegel for his conduct, saying, ``In short, there is
no excuse for what he did. ... What we have here, we've seen far
too many times before in the financial community.''
   Siegel's cooperation led to the controversial insider trading
cases against Richard B. Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor, two of
Siegel's associates at Kidder, Peabody, and Freeman, formerly head
of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs.
   The arrests in 1987 of the three traders, one being led from his
office in handcuffs, stunned the financial community and led to
widespread predictions that more Wall Street professionals would be
implicated in the scandal.
   The government alleged Freeman made profitable stock deals on
inside information about takeover attempts supplied by Siegel, and
that Wigton and Tabor made trading decisions using the tips from
Freeman.
   The case eventually was dropped when the government said it
needed more time to gather evidence. But last year, after more than
two years of investigations, prosecutors announced they would bring
no charges against Wigton and Tabor.
   Freeman agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud and
admitted he received inside information in January 1986 from Siegel
and used the tip to execute various trades. He was sentenced in
April to four months in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Cartusciello recommended Siegel
receive a lesser sentence because he cooperated and Freeman did not.
   While at first saying Siegel should be ``terribly ashamed'' for
what he had done, the prosecutor went on to praise his ``thorough
and open'' cooperation.
   Cartusciello said almost all the information supplied by Siegel
was corroborated independently.
   The prosecutor said Siegel's testimony against Freeman was
especially important because the type of scheme they carried out
was rarely detected by employers or investigators.
   The terms of Siegel's probation require he perform 2,400 hours
of community service at a community college in Jacksonville, Fla.,
where he lives, and another 600 hours of community service
unrelated to his financial skills.
   Siegel was to surrender at a yet unspecified facility sometime
before July 15.
   According to court papers, Boesky paid Siegel $700,000 for stock
tips over four years. The payments were in exchange for information
he gave Boesky about corporate takeover battles he waged as an
investment banker at Kidder, Peabody.
   Boesky, who pleaded guilty to one felony count to settle the
biggest insider trading case, was recently released after
completing two years of a three-year prison sentence.

<HEAD>Liquidating Carrier Sells $57 Million Worth Of Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday
approved bids totalling $59 million for Braniff's most valuable
assets.
   The Orlando-based airline is liquidating under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Act and received $7 million more than originally
planned for the assets. Once fearful of recovering nothing,
creditors will now receive at least a few pennies on the dollar.
   The biggest single sale at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Orlando went
to Orix Group. The Tokyo-based financial services company bid $47.8
million for Braniff's rights to buy 74 A-320 jets from Airbus
Industrie. It plans to use the planes to start a new equipment
leasing division.
   AVSA S.A.R.L. and Airbus Service Co. Inc. ended up with some
Airbus spare parts for $7.1 million. Both companies are affiliates
of the Airbus consortium, which is based in Toulouse, France.
   IAE International Aero Engines AG outbid the two Airbus
affiliates to nab some engine spare parts for $4.4 million. Based
in Switzerland, IAE is an international consortium that makes
aircraft engines.
   Before Orix and IAE came forward as bidders, the Airbus
affiliates had agreed to pay roughly $52 million in cash for the
aircraft contracts and spare parts. That sales agreement was
contingent on no higher bids being received.
   ``Not only is this a good deal from the debtor's point of view,
but it's a great deal,'' said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge C. Timothy
Corcoran III.

<HEAD>Directors Take Anti-Takeover Steps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of Reebok International Ltd.,
faced with the prospect of nearly one-third of the company's stock
on the market, have adopted a series of anti-takeover defenses to
keep corporate raiders away from the sneaker company.
   Pentland Industries PLC of England announced it would sell the
31.5 percent of Reebok stock it owns.
   In response, the directors of the Stoughton-based manufacturer
of sneakers and casual wear adopted a shareholder rights plan
Thursday.
   It entitles stock-owners to buy additional shares at a greatly
reduced price in the event of a takeover attempt. The issuance of
new stock would make it expensive for a buyer to take control of
the company.
   Reebok also announced its board will take advantage of a new
Massachusetts law and create three classes of directors, which
lengthens the time it would take to install an entirely new board.
   Pentland Industries, a shoe manufacturer and investment company
in Finchley, England, helped Reebok to success in the early 1980s.
   It loaned money to Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok, and
provided him with letters of credit after Fireman bought the rights
to distribute Reebok shoes from a small British company.
   ``They've made a lot of money with it,'' said Paul F. Duncan,
Reebok's chief financial officer. ``It's been an extraordinary
investment for them. ... Pentland has expressed a desire to sell
their shares and get on with whatever else they want to do in
life.''
   The reason for Pentland's desire to sell its Reebok stock was
not disclosed.
   Fireman and Rubin had a cross-agreement under which either had
first right to buy the other's shares if placed on the market.
   It was not known whether Fireman would buy Pentland's stock in
Reebok. Fireman and his wife own 14.5 percent of Reebok shares.

<HEAD>Pathe Extends MGM-UA Tender Offer Again as Deadline Looms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. on
Friday extended its $1.2 billion offer for MGM-UA Communications
Co. to June 22, one day before the final deadline to complete its
complex package for financing the buyout.
   It was the second week-long extension of the tender offer by
Pathe, a movie producer and distributor controlled by Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti. But even previously skeptical
analysts said it now appears Pathe is in the final stages of
paperwork on the deal.
   ``They appear to be very close to being able to complete the
transaction,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment industry
analyst at the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. stock brokerage.
   The $20-per-share offer expires June 23, according to Parretti's
agreement with MGM-UA and Tracinda Corp., the holding company
through which Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk Kerkorian controls
MGM-UA.
   To help the deal along, Kerkorian has said he may keep about $20
million in stock _ a fraction of the $800 million his 40 million
shares would bring him if all were sold.
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said it hasn't been decided if
Kerkorian will keep the $20 million in stock. Parsons also said a
French economic minister's blockage Friday of Pathe's attempt to
acquire a controlling interest in the Pathe Cinema theater chain in
France was unrelated to the MGM-UA deal.
   Parretti has made cash down payments of $200 million. Time
Warner Inc. has agreed to lend him another $650 million in return
for a lien on the United Artists film library and distribution
rights on that library and new MGM, Pathe and United Artists films
for 20 years.
   The rest of the financing has been a topic of broad speculation.
But Parretti revealed details of the complex package this week:
mainly short-term loans and asset sales by Pathe-affiliated
companies in Europe, and the possible resale of MGM-UA stock or
sale of new Pathe shares after the merger.
   Merely completing the paperwork for the non-U.S. banks involved
in the lending for the deal is likely to be a logistical nightmare,
Logsdon said.
   Last year, a bid by Australia's Qintex group to buy MGM-UA for
$1.5 billion collapsed for lack of financing. Qintex outbid media
mogul Rupert Murdoch by $100 million. But Qintex was unable to come
up with a $50 million down payment and Murdoch refused to get back
in the bidding.
   In structuring the Pathe buyout, Kerkorian has assured himself
he can pocket the $200 million in cash even if the deal collapses.
Parretti also has guaranteed MGM-UA $75 million in fees from
distributing three upcoming Pathe releases, including ``The Russia
House'' with Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer and ``Quigley Down
Under'' with Tom Selleck.
   Jeanne Ouellette, an MGM-UA spokeswoman, said she wasn't sure
about Kerkorian retaining a stake in the company, but said the deal
was expected to go through even if it comes down to the final
deadline.

<TEXT>
   ABC on Thursday adopted NBC's ratings formula
for calculating the ``make good'' free ad time it gives to
advertisers on shows delivering lower ratings than the network
promised.
   CBS executives issued a statement at the close of the business
day in which CBS endorsed NBC's statistical formula, but said
nothing about whether CBS, too, would adopt the formula in its
make-good policy.
   ABC urged unity among advertisers and broadcasters.
   ``A uniform stewardship policy is in the best interest of the
entire advertising and television network communities,'' ABC said
in a statement released by spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer.
   CBS had been expected to endorse the plan, which comes at the
start of the fall season's $4 billion ``upfront'' ad market, which
brings in nearly half the $9 billion to $10 billion ad revenue
estimated the fall season.
   All three networks blame this season's overall ratings decline
on the ``people meter'' system used by the A.C. Nielsen Co. to
gather viewership figures in 4,000 homes nationwide.
   ABC initially said it would adjust its ratings based on average
viewing since 1987, when the ``people meter'' became the industry
standard.
   NBC, which estimated its loses from lower ratings at $100
million, proposed an eight-year Nielsen ratings trend as a
baseline, using a statistical technique called ``regression
analysis'' to project TV usage.
   NBC would give away make-good time only when TV usage equals or
exceeds the prediction derived from Nielsen's historical data.
   ``If the usage that we find is equal to or greater than our
forecast, then we don't dispute the shortfall and we pay off,''
said Nick Schiavone, NBC's vice president for sales and marketing
research.
   CBS, without elaboration, issued the following statement: ``The
process of regression analysis as outlined by NBC is, in principal,
acceptable to us.''
   It wasn't immediately clear what the network meant. David
Poltrack, CBS' vice president for research, was gone for the day
and could not be reached for comment, said spokeswoman Betsy Wagner.
   Nielsen, which earns $22 million annually from the three
networks, insists its people meter system is not flawed and that
fewer people are watching network television.
   A viewer in a people meter household `logs on'' to the device.
The previous system recorded what was being viewed, but not who was
watching. Critics of that system cited ``button fatigue'' as the
cause of inaccurate numbers.
   ABC said the problem of ``the unexplained volatility and viewing
losses reported by Nielsen'' still must be addressed by
broadcasters, advertisers and their agencies.

<TEXT>
   Philips Industries Inc. has been acquired by
Tomkins PLC of the United Kingdom for about $550 million, the two
companies said Friday.
   Shareholders of both companies must approve the merger. Tomkins
plans a vote in July, and Philips in August.
   ``I strongly support this transaction and intend to vote my
shares in favor of the merger,'' said Jesse Philips, a director and
founder of the Dayton-based company who owns about 5.1 percent of
the outstanding common shares.
   Philips manufactures components for residential, commercial and
industrial buildings, manufactured housing, recreational vehicles
and the transportation industry. Its 1989 sales were $927.5 million.
   Tomkins owns and operates manufacturing and distribution
businesses in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Its principal U.S.
businesses are the Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co., which makes power
mowers and bicycles; and Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., which makes
firearms. Tomkins reported sales of $1.1 billion for 1989.
   The sale price amounts to about $18.50 per share of Philips
stock, about 32 percent over the selling price of Philips common
shares on June 4, the day before the announcement of an agreement
in principle.
   Philips stock closed Friday at $17.875 on the New York Stock
Exchange, up 25 cents.
   Tomkins said it is financing the acquisition through an offering
of shares of its stock in the United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Collapse On Weak Demand, Rumored Price Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices collapsed Friday, reflecting weak
demand, a larger government estimate of the Florida crop and
unsubstantiated rumors of Brazilian price cuts.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures plunged while cattle
futures were mixed; precious metals rebounded; energy futures were
mixed; and grains and soybeans fell.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 5 cents to
10.65 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July down 10.65
cents at $1.795 a pound. The contracts are traded on the New York
Cotton Exchange.
   The selloff followed a Florida Citrus Department report Thursday
that U.S. consumption of non-concentrated orange juice was about 15
percent below a year ago during the four weeks ending April 21.
   Movement of Florida orange juice has averaged less than 3
million gallons per week for several months ``and that's just not
good,'' said Ernie Thomas, a commodity specialist with Merrill
Lynch Consumer Markets in Winter Haven, Fla.
   He attributed some of the slack demand to the higher prices for
orange juice following the Christmastime freeze that wiped out a
quarter to a third of the Florida crop.
   The 1989-90 Florida harvest came in a little larger than the
government had feared, though. In a crop report Tuesday, the
Agriculture Department pegged the final tally at 110.1 million
boxes, 2 million above the previous month's estimate.
   Brazil, meanwhile, had a record orange harvest last year of
roughly 300 million boxes. Because of the Florida shortfall, Brazil
now supplies about half of the orange juice sold in the United
States, Thomas said.
   Rumors that Brazilian processors have cut their prices were not
confirmed but contributed to the market's decline.
   Near-term hog and pork-belly futures fell their permitted daily
limits for the second straight day on the the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting sluggish demand for pork products and
indications of ample hog supplies.
   Cattle futures finished mixed, with strength in the cash market
helping to offset spillover selling from the pork pits.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June
at 76.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .12
cent higher with August at 84.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .55
cent to the limit 1.5 cents lower with June at 61.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .92 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with
July at 66.45 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures rebounded slightly from two days of
steep losses on New York's Commodity Exchange. Analysts attributed
the buying to pre-weekend account-reconciling.
   Gold futures settled $2.50 to $3.10 higher with June at $349.50
a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.9 cents higher with June at
$4.811 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange due
to oversupply and the approaching expiration of the July crude
contract, which goes off the board Wednesday.
   Strong demand for gasoline pushed nearby gas prices up sharply.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 51 cents
lower with July at $16.62 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to .83
cent lower with July at 48.37 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.05 cent lower to 1.39 cents higher with July at 61.51 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures closed moderately to sharply lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, extending recent losses amid active
selling that occurred late in an otherwise lackluster session.
   Forecasts for near-ideal crop weather in the Midwest through
mid-July have weighed on corn and soybean prices all week. Late in
Friday's session, prices of both commodities fell low enough to
trigger substantial new selling.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 5 cents lower with July at
$3.28 a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 6{ cents lower with July at
$2.83 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with July at
$1.38{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6{ cents lower with July
at $5.86 a bushel.

   The dollar remained higher against the yen Friday
morning and share prices gained marginally on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar was trading at 154.36 yen at late morning, up 0.83
yen from Thursday's close of 153.53 yen. After opening at 154.50
yen, the currency ranged between 154.25 yen and 154.57 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 8.10
points to close the morning session at 32,676.21. The index rose
296.34 points on Thursday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's higher opening reflected its
levels reached in overnight trading overseas.
   Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the
dollar remained in a narrow range. ``Everyone is basically waiting
the release of the latest U.S. trade figures,'' Yoshida said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to announce the
nation's merchandise trade figures for April later Friday.
   Some traders say the deficit may show a significant decline to
about $7.2 billion from the previous month's wider-than-expected
$8.45 billion deficit.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index moved little with many
investors taking a wait-and-see position because of the yen's
weakness and lower bond prices, securities dealers said.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 87.87 points from Thursday's close of 88.09. That
boosted the yield to 7.00 percent from 6.955 percent.

   Northwest said it is prepared to extend its Boston-Amsterdam
nonstop service to include both Moscow and Leningrad beginning next
May 1. The airline would fly four times a week on an
Amsterdam-Moscow-Leningrad route using 294-seat McDonnell Douglas

   Donald Trump missed a payment due Friday on junk
bonds used to finance one of his Atlantic City resorts, the
harshest signal yet of the troubles plaguing his tottering real
estate empire.
   Trump has a 10-day grace period to make the payment of an
estimated $31 million in interest and principal on bonds used to
finance his Trump Castle hotel-casino.
   But the failure to meet Friday's deadline nevertheless brought
him a step closer to default, which theoretically could force a
bankruptcy filing to defend the flamboyant developer from
collateral-seeking creditors.
   ``What this tells us is he has not been able to reach a deal
with his banks,'' Michael Mulvaney, a bond analyst with Moody's
Investors Services Inc. said of the missed payment. ``He has the
grace period to work it out. If he doesn't work it out, then you've
got the possibility of default.''
   Separately, Moody's, a major Wall Street credit rating firm, on
Friday lowered its ratings for bonds used to finance the Trump Taj
Mahal and Trump Plaza hotel-casinos. Moody's said the missed
payment for Trump Castle showed the potential for weakened finances
at the other two resorts.
   A statement issued by the Trump Organization announcing the
missed payment said negotiations were continuing with lenders to
get more money and restructure loans.
   Trump and his main bankers tentatively had agreed a week ago to
a bailout that would have provided him another $60 million in loans
and a temporary suspension of payments. In exchange, the banks
would have gotten equity in some of his properties.
   If the deal had been finalized he would have had the cash to
make Friday's bond payment.
   But other banks involved in the deal reportedly balked at the
plan. First Fidelity Bancorp of Newark, N.J., and Midlantic Banks
Inc. of Edison, N.J., reportedly were the main holdouts. Midlantic
would not comment on the situation Friday.
   Late Friday, First Fidelity announced it would resign as trustee
for the bondholders once a successor is found. The bank said it
wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in its
role as both a bank lender and overseer of bondholders' interest as
trustee.
   Spokesmen for his four major bank lenders _ Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan, Bankers Trust and Manufacturers Hanover _ either would
not comment or did not return telephone calls.
   Trump has been beset by a slumping real estate market in New
York, and disappointing results from his three Atlantic City
casinos and the Trump Shuttle airline.
   His real estate holdings, which also include New York's Plaza
Hotel and Trump Tower, were built largely with funds borrowed with
junk bonds and bank loans. Trump owes banks an estimated $2 billion
and bondholders another $1 billion.
   The ongoing negotiations have raised speculation that bankers
want more authority over operation of his properties, possibly even
naming new managers and leaving Trump only as a figurehead.
   The negotiations also have caught the eye of the New Jersey
Casino Control Commission.
   ``It's always a matter of concern when any casino is in
difficulty,'' said Tom Flynn, a commission spokesman. Also, the New
Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement has been auditing Trump's
properties for more than a month. The DGE, an arm of the state
Attorney General's office, has characterized the audit as routine.
   Friday's payment was due on two bonds issued to finance the
Trump Castle, one paying 13.75 percent due in 1997 and one paying 7
percent due in 1999.
   Trump, who bought back many of his bonds at a discount on the
open market, owes about $12 million in interest and $10 million in
principal on the 13.75 percent bonds and about $9 million on the 7
percent bonds, according to Sheila O'Connell, a bond analyst with
Duff &amp; Phelps, a Chicago investment firm.
   The total amount Trump would owe if he had not bought back any
bonds is $42.6 million.
   In the first three months of 1990, Trump Castle lost $8.4
million, the largest loss among the 12 casinos in Atlantic City.
   Trump Castle recorded improved gross gaming revenues for the
first three months of the year, but failed to maintain those gains
after the Taj Mahal opened April 2.
   Trump Castle's ``win'' in May fell 17.3 percent from a year
earlier to $17.9 million.
   The ``win'' is the amount of money a casino wins at gaming
tables and slot machines and does not account for operating
expenses, depreciation, debt service, taxes and other charges.
   For May, the Taj Mahal broke its own citywide record for win
with $36.5 million, or $1.18 million a day. Trump Plaza, helped by
a $10 million windfall from an unlucky Japanese high roller at the
baccarat table, posted a win of $31.3 million, up 23 percent from
May 1989.

   Two regional phone companies, Bell Atlantic and U S West, have
been selected by the Czechoslovakian telephone authority to build a
cellular phone system in that nation, the companies said Friday.
   Under the contract signed Friday, Bell Atlantic and U S West
will form a joint venture company with the Czech Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications that also will advise the ministry on
rebuilding the nation's phone network, the companies said in a
statement.
   The joint venture will be 51 percent owned by the ministry and
49 percent by the two U.S. companies. No value for the deal was
disclosed.
   Construction of the cellular system is expected to start in the
fall, the companies said.
   U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., already is building a
cellular system in Hungary.
   Steven Andrews, president of U S West International, said the
addition of the Czech system ``gives us a firm base from which to
build a wireless network serving Eastern European customers.''
   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, owns local phone companies
in the mid-Atlantic region. U S West subsidiaries provide phone
service in 14 Western states.
   On Thursday, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, a regional phone
company based in Chicago, announced they and two New Zealand
companies will buy that nation's government-owned phone system.

   Retail prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
May, easing the strain on consumers' budgets after a painful spurt
in prices early in the year, the government said.
   The April and May moderation in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index curbed inflation for the first five months of the year
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.8 percent.
   That's up significantly from the 4.6 percent rate for all of
last year, but down sharply from the worrisome 8.5 percent rate in
the first quarter. The latest figures were released Friday.

   Industrial production jumped 0.6 percent in

   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported Friday that exports
helped shrink the U.S. trade deficit so far this year to an annual
rate of $92.16 billion, compared to a deficit for all of 1989 of
$108.99 billion.

   British stock market experts said they were

trading to an effort to recapture trading of U.S. stocks now

   The experts said Friday such trading is relatively small in
Europe, and it also is not clear that the business will grow much
in coming years.
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. on Thursday unveiled a
five-step plan to trade securities after the exchange's traditional

   Carmike Cinemas Inc. said Friday it is
buying 24 movie theaters in three Southeastern states from
Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon Corp. for about $11 million.
   Separately, Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon said it was selling 38
theaters in five Midwest and Western states that are part of its
Plitt Theaters Inc. subsidiary to Plitt Amusement Co. Inc. of Los
Angeles.
   The theaters being purhased by Columbus-based Carmike are in
North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee and include 96 screens.
   ``As part of our ongoing, long-term expansion strategy, this
acquisition will open new markets to Carmike,'' said Michael W.
Patrick, Carmike's president and chief executive officer.
   Theaters in the three states that are not part of the Carmike
deal will be returned to the landlords, closed or sold, Cineplex
said.
   The Plitt theaters being sodl are in the states of Utah, Idaho,
Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. That deal is valued at $31.8
million.
   Cineplex Odeon President Allen Karp said the theater sales were
part of the Canadian company's strategy of focusing on its
principal markets.
   Cineplex, which has been under financial pressure, said it will
use proceeds from the sales to pay down its long-term debt.
   After the sales, Cineplex will have 1,550 screens in 390
locations in the United States and Canada.
