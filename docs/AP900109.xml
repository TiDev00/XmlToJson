   Diplomatic efforts began Wednesday in
Bangkok, Beijing and Paris to try to resolve the 11-year-old
Cambodian war following reports of guerrilla attacks in Phnom Penh
and Cambodia's second-largest city.
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed they attacked the Cambodian
capital with grenades Saturday night, forcing the premier and
president to flee toward Vietnam. But the claim could not be
confirmed, and previous communist Khmer Rouge claims have been
exaggerated.
   Khmer Rouge army radio however said Wednesday the guerrillas
held Battambang, Cambodia's second city, for four hours last
weekend and still controlled a position that had defended Route 5,
the major highway leading from the city across country to Phnom
Penh.
   It said the 5th military region's command at the provincial
office building was destroyed and the Bek Chan airfield was
``utterly damaged'' with the control tower and two planes destroyed.
   The non-communist resistance forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
allies of the Khmer Rouge, said they launched a series of grenade
attacks on Phnom Penh between Dec. 5 and 10, wounding 16 Vietnamese
and two Cambodian policemen.
   The Cambodian government's SPK news agency on Tuesday did not
mention any attack.
   Igor Rogachev, a Soviet deputy foreign minister, arrived in
Beijing on Tuesday for talks on Cambodia with Chinese Foreign
Ministry officials. Rogachev will likely dicuss an Australian
proposal calling for the Vietnam-backed government in Phnom Penh to
be replaced by an interim U.N. administration until free elections
can be held, said Soviet Embassy spokesman Yuri Lysenko.
   The Soviets back the pro-Vietnamese government while China arms
the guerrillas.
   The French Foreign Ministry on Tuesday scheduled a meeting in
Paris on Jan. 15-16 for the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council to discuss Cambodia, and the Australian plan could
be on the agenda.
   The meeting ``will permit an examination of all the proposals
advanced in recent weeks concerning Cambodia and a study of all
means that might bring an end to armed conflicts on the ground,''
the ministry said. ``It comes at a time when it appears possible to
envisage an increased role for the United Nations in the settlement
process.''
   The Austalian plan would require backing from all five permanent
members of the Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, arrived in Thailand on
Tuesday in hopes of meeting representatives of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government and the three guerrilla groups to
hear their views on the Australian plan and on efforts. Indonesia
has been the host of several regional peace conferences.
   The conflict has raged since Vietnamese troops in late 1978
ended the brutal 3{-year reign of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians while trying to create a
primitive agrarian society.
   Fears of a battlefield victory by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
of three guerrilla groups, have risen since September, when Vietnam
said it withdrew all troops.
   A Thai military intelligence officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday: ``The Khmer Rouge are clearly ... moving
deeper and deeper. They want to sabotage the credibility of the
government.''
   The Khmer Rouge said earlier they had attacked and set ablaze
Battambang on Friday and Saturday. A Western diplomat in Thailand
said the Battambang attack ``was more psychological than
strategic.''
   The reported attack in Phnom Penh, if confirmed, would be the
most serious in the civil war.
   The Khmer Rouge broadcast said resistance forces lobbed five
grenades Saturday into the center of Phnom Penh near the office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party, killing or wounding
some Vietnamese and ``lackey puppets.''
   Another broadcast said the guerrillas attacked the city and
suburbs with 32 grenades and plastic explosives, killing or
wounding some Vietnamese soldiers and others who were drinking near
a hotel. Vietnamese secret agents and Cambodian policemen were
killed in the suburbs, it said.
   The Cambodian government's SPK news agency, monitored in
Bangkok, did not mention any attack. It said Sunday's National Day
celebrations took place in ``total security'' and that Saturday and
Monday also were peaceful.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said she had no information about the reported guerrilla offensive.
In reply to a question, she again defended U.S. policy as
supporting a role for the Khmer Rouge in any transitional
government, but added: ``We abhor the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge,
we have said, are absolutely horrible.''
   The guerrillas said their attacks prevented Premier Hun Sen from
meeting in Phnom Penh with Australian Deputy Foreign Secretary
Michael Costello for talks on a peace plan. It said Hun Sen went
from Ho Chi Minh City to Cambodia's eastern Svay Rieng province,
bordering Vietnam, to meet the envoy.
   Costello said after arriving in Bangkok on Tuesday that as far
as he knew, the venue was changed from Phnom Penh to Svay Rieng on
Saturday and that he first heard of the change Sunday. He could not
confirm the grenade attack.
   SPK said Hun Sen invited Costello to meet him in Svay Rieng
because the premier was already there on an inspection tour.
   It said Hun Sen told Costello he agreed to a U.N. role in an
interim administration only if the U.N. seat held by the guerrillas
first is vacated.

   An Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter
crashed during desert exercises Tuesday, killing all four soldiers
aboard, a base spokesman said.
   The helicopter crashed at 3:32 p.m. about 14 miles east of the
main post of the sprawling Mojave Desert base, said Capt. Gary
Cleland.
   The names of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of
families.
   All were assigned to the 4th Battalion, 1st Aviation Regiment of
the 1st Infantry Division from Fort Riley, Kan.
   The 1st Infantry Division has been taking part in a three-week
field training exercise that began Jan. 3, Cleland said.
   ``No further details on the accident are available at this
time,'' Cleland said.
   The accident was being investigated by local Army officials and
personnel from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.
   A Blackhawk crew includes two pilots and a crew chief and can
carry a load of 2,640 pounds or 11 combat-equipped troops.

   An amphibian importer has spawned a controversy
by entering giant frogs in the annual Frog Jump Jubilee, making
some people hopping mad because the jumbo jumpers can stretch 3
feet and weigh up to 15 pounds.
   Organizers say Andy J. Koffman, 40, has created a ``superfrog
crisis'' with his bid to enter 10 oversized amphibians from Africa
in the whimsical competition started by Mark Twain's story, ``The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.''
   Imagine basketball players 40 or 50 feet tall. That's about the
human equivalent of the frogs Koffman wants to enter in the contest
to be held in May in Angels Camp, Calif.
   ``I'll apply for a green card for these guys if I have to,''
Koffman said Sunday. ``This is what America is all about.''
   Koffman, a licensed importer of exotic birds, reptiles and
amphibians from Africa for nearly 13 years, says he is the sole
successful importer of the Goliath frog, a denizen of swift-flowing
rivers in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.
   He said he had imported 50 of the frogs, which can measure 3
feet in length. He sold 30 of them to the Cincinnati Zoo, the
Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, a
Japanese importer for zoos there, a zoo in the Netherlands and a
wholesaler in Florida.
   The other 20, ranging from 3 pounds to 8 pounds, occupy a pond
in his basement. He says he is preparing to import some 15 pounders.
   Until now, virtually all the entrants have been California
bullfrogs, with the biggest about a pound, said Diane Baumann,
interim manager for the 39th Agricultural District Association,
which has run the event since it was started in 1928 at the
Calaveras County Fair.
   ``We have had some imports from Africa, but they were always
about the same size,'' she said in a telephone interview Sunday
night.
   The nine-member association board of directors is meeting Friday
to discuss the issue, ``probably in executive (closed) session due
to the possibility of litigation,'' she said.
   Concerns include fairness, safety and survival of the
competition, Baumann said.
   ``It's like racing a draft horse against thoroughbreds; entirely
different species,'' Baumann said.
   The contest record of 21 feet, 5} inches for three hops was set
by Rosie the Ribiter in 1986. Koffman says his superfrogs can
easily exceed that in a single bound.
   Baumann also said some feared one of the Goliaths might leap out
of the arena _ ``unfortunately, our stage is only about 35 feet
deep'' _ and hit a spectator.
   Moreover, unlike their much smaller relatives, the monster frogs
have sharp teeth and might gobble up their competitors, she said.
   Koffman says he feeds his 20 frogs about 100 goldfish a week,
varying their diet with occasional mice and crickets.
   ``They do have a voracious appetite,'' he said. ``They'll eat
anything that moves.''
   He said he once dissected a frog in Africa and found what looked
like an entire colony of army ants in the stomach.
   ``What this guy did was, he found one of these columns of ants
and got in front and opened his mouth and let the whole colony walk
in,'' Koffman said. ``They'll eat birds, baby chicks.''
   He keeps the frogs in a 1,500-gallon pond about 12 feet square,
with logs and plants around the perimeter and an island in the
center. Air and water are kept at a constant 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
the walls of the room are padded and lined with plastic and the
water is kept slightly alkaline.
   Koffman said he grew up as a doctor's son in East Tawas, Mich.,
went from home aquariums to owning four pet stores by age 18,
earned a degree in business administration at the University of
Michigan and became an importer of exotic creatures.

<HEAD>State GOP: Duke Risks Censure in Senate Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   David Duke hitched his white supremacy line
to the Louisiana Republican Party in 1989 and shocked loyal
regulars with a state House victory. Now, he wants a ride to
Capitol Hill on the Grand Old Party.
   Four Louisiana Republicans are battling for the state
endorsement Saturday in the race against U.S. Sen. Bennett
Johnston, three-term Democratic darling of the powerful oil and gas
lobby.
   Duke should not expect the party's backing at the New Orleans
convention, said William Nungesser, chairman of the Louisiana GOP.
In December caucuses, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,
pulled in only a few non-binding delegate pledges.
   ``Caucuses are a party-insider type of situation. The votes that
really count are the votes that come on Election Day,'' Duke said.
   But he said he'll run as a Republican with or without a GOP
blessing.
   That move could bring down the wrath of the Louisiana party,
which at times has appeared almost ambivalent about Duke, Nungesser
said.
   ``David Duke's past is horrible. No reasonable person should be
ready to forgive him based on his own statements. Any reasonable,
rational person should not believe he's changed just because he
says he has,'' Nungesser said.
   He predicted that a previously failed attempt to censure Duke
would be revived if he runs against Johnston without party backing.
   ``It will prove once again he's got his own agenda,'' Nungesser
said.
   The Oct. 6 election is an open primary, a candidate free-for-all
without regard to party. If no one wins a majority, the top two
vote-getters enter a runoff.
   Duke, 39, has been a thorn in the GOP side since the polished,
handsome advocate of Caucasian purity switched his registration
from Democrat to Republican.
   A few weeks later, he claimed a 227-vote victory for a seat in
the Louisiana Legislature by defeating John Treen, brother of
Louisiana's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, David
Treen.
   Duke left the Klan in 1980, accused of trying to sell a
membership list to a rival faction, and now leads his own group,
the National Association for the Advancement of White People. Since
campaigning for the state House, Duke's racist, anti-Semitic points
of view have been cloaked in euphemism, critics charge.
   Duke, in turn, says he champions equal rights for everyone,
including whites. Welfare reform, elimination of minority
set-asides and birth control programs for teen-agers are his
platform.
   Duke's election spurred Republican National Committee Chairman
Lee Atwater to denounce him as a ``charlatan.'' Duke ignored the
declaration, saying the Republicans hadn't helped him anyway.
   Even presidents Bush and Reagan endorsed opponent John Treen
last year. Duke said he doesn't expect the state party's support
this ear.
   ``No matter who they endorse, I am planning on running. I hope
other candidates will run,'' Duke said.
   He said he has the best chance to dislodge Johnston.
   ``I think his support is extremely soft. I think he's very, very
vulnerable,'' Duke said.
   ``I think my candidacy would assure his defeat. I would appeal
to his traditional voters, a majority of the white blue-collar
vote, along with some conservative Republicans,'' Duke said.
   Johnston counters that the Republican Party is under siege.
   ``There's almost a battle going on for the soul of the
Republican Party. There are those like David Treen who say that
Duke should be censured and in effect, declared an illegitimate
Republican, and there are others who more or less welcomed him into
the party,'' Johnston said.
   Beth Rickey, a New Orleans member of the GOP state central
committee, is not confident her party will take a bold stand
against Duke. The committee rejected her earlier censure attempt,
saying it had inadequate procedural grounds.
   ``There's a lot of embarrassment. The perception is that they
are weak and wimpy and have not done anything,'' Ms. Rickey said.
   Duke's effect on the Legislature was limited _ none of his bills
passed. But public sentiment was favorable when a move to block his
seating fizzled. Lawmakers who live as many as 300 miles away from
Duke's nearly all-white district in suburban New Orleans said they
got calls pressing them to let Duke take the oath of office.
   Duke had finally achieved a degree of mainstream credibility. It
was something that eluded him since the 1970s when he was known as
the Nazi of Louisiana State University.
   Duke joined the KKK in high school and is largely credited with
shifting the organization's focus from night-riding lynchmen to an
unmasked family group, knee-deep in white culture and wrapped in
the American flag.
   Duke says he earns his living as an author and has acknowledged
writing under a pseudonymn a sex manual called ``Finders Keepers''
and a street-fighting manual for blacks called ``African Atto.''

<HEAD>Hunger Strike by Iran-Supported Inmate Increases Tension</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report. Anis Naccache is pronounced

<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-month hunger strike by the leader of an
Iranian-directed team that failed in a 1980 bid to assassinate an
exile leader in Paris is raising concern about possible terrorist
attacks in France.
   Anis Naccache, supported by Iran's president and foreign
minister, says France promised to free him in the deal that won the
release in May 1988 of all French hostages that were held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Serving a life sentence, Naccache could only get out of prison
if pardoned by President Francois Mitterrand, who has said he might
do so, but has not made clear when or under what circumstances.
   Naccache, a Lebanese Moslem, has lost 59 pounds since he started
his fast on Sept. 8 and weighs only 105 pounds, said his lawyer,
Jacques Verges.
   Naccache is refusing food but is drinking liquids and is fed
intravenously from time to time by doctors at the Fresne prison
outside Paris.
   Naccache has lost his immune defenses to disease, Verges said.
   ``If tomorrow someone goes into his cell and sneezes in his
nose, he could very well die from it,'' Verges said on French
television.
   It is widely believed that if Naccache dies in prison, his
friends will strike back.
   ``The death of Anis Naccache, if it comes brutally at the end of
his hunger strike, will by all evidence be serious for France,
which would find itself confronted by an increased terrorist menace
easy to predict,'' the conservative newspaper Le Figaro wrote
Saturday.
   The hunger strike seems to have hardened Mitterrand's stand.
   ``He cannot hope to free himself with a hunger strike,'' the
president said Friday. ``If Anis Naccache decides to die in prison
and we do not have the means to stop him, this will be his
responsibility.''
   A year ago, Mitterrand called on Iran to provide proof that
Naccache's freedom really had been promised in the hostage deal
negotiated by the conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati have said it was promised but apparently have not
given Mitterrand any evidence.
   Chirac denied Naccache's release was part of the agreement, and
Mitterrand said: ``I have no reason to doubt the word of Mr.
Chirac.''
   During the uncomfortable two-year period of ``cohabitation'' in
French government, the conservative premier and Socialist president
were not sharing many secrets. The hostage deal came at the peak of
the hotly contested 1988 election campaign in which Mitterrand won
re-election by defeating Chirac, and the Socialists regained
control of the government.
   But the former premier suggested that Mitterrand should consider
including Naccache in the annual Bastille Day pardon on July 14,
1989, ``because we are in a period of tension and should not add to
the reasons that might make us targets of terrorism.''
   Naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded
by a group calling itself the Committee for Solidarity with Arab
and Middle East Political Prisoners, which claimed responsibility
for bombings in 1985 and 1986 that killed 13 people and injured
more than 250 in Paris.
   Investigators say they believe the committee was a front for
Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shiite extremist organization in Lebanon
that denies involvement in terrorism and hostage-taking.
   In an accident of the court calendar that is sure to increase
the pressure, 10 people charged in the 1985-86 bombings will come
to trial Jan. 29.
   The alleged leader of the group, Fouad Ali Saleh of Tunisia,
gave a hint of what is to come at a pre-trial hearing Friday,
shouting in court, ``Hezbollah will massacre you!'' and ``The West
will die at the hand of Islam, prepare your caskets!''
   When Prosecutor Jacques Fourvel tried to interrupt, Saleh yelled
out, ``Shut up, you! Jews and Christians have no right to talk when
a Moslem is speaking. Islam will be your death. God will crush you,
murderer, son of a pig, executioner! You eat like a pig, you have
ripped up the Koran!''
   Naccache's hunger strike and the upcoming trial were cited as
possible reasons last month when France put stiff anti-terrorist
security checks into effect, especially at airports and border
crossings.
   Fears were spurred by the seizure of 485 pounds of explosives in
Valencia, Spain, apparently en route for France. Spanish police
said at least three men arrested with the explosives were Hezbollah
members.
   Naccache and four other men were convicted in the July 1980
attack on Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before the 1979
Islamic revolution. Bakhtiar escaped injury and still lives in
Paris, but a policeman and a bystander were killed.
   Both defense and prosecution said at the trial that Naccache and
his team were acting on orders from senior Iranian officials.

   The Ceausescus looted public museums
of thousands of valuable artworks during their authoritarian rule
and turned the country's Culture Ministry into ``a corpse,'' says
the new head of the department.
   ``It was a simple matter of greed,'' Culture Minister Andrei
Plesu said in an interview Monday. Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ``had
to possess these works,'' he added.
   Plesu, a respected art historian and philosopher, had been
banished to the provinces under the rule of Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena. The Ceausescus were ousted last month, found guilty of
``grave crimes'' and executed Dec. 25.
   The official, appointed by the provisional government, spoke in
a chilly and gloomy conference hall of his department, known under
Ceausescu as The Council of Culture and Socialist Education.
   Plesu said ministry employees had just begun work on an
inventory of paintings, sculptures and other art objects reclaimed
from dozens of houses and vacation homes used by the Ceausescus and
their relatives.
   ``He stole from our patrimony objects of art and used them in
his own house,'' said Plesu, 40, estimating that thousands of
valuable works by Romanian and foreign artists were claimed by the
Ceausescus.
   ``There were houses full of such objects,'' Plesu said. He said
he believed Flemish masters were among the artists whose paintings
were taken illegally.
   Ceausescu's hunger for art appeared to be common knowledge in
Romania.
   Bogdan Lazaroae, a 21-year-old student, said the art museum in
his home city of Sibiu, 150 miles northwest of Bucharest, had been
forced to contribute a Rembrandt to the Ceausescu collection.
   Plesu, forced last year to move from Bucharest to a Bacau
district town near the border to Soviet Moldavia after signing a
letter critical of the state writers' union, said the dictator had
no sense of art.
   Plesu described the organization preceding his ministry as ``an
institution organized against culture'' that suppressed most
artistic expression not complimentary to the Ceausescus.
   ``I have to revive a corpse,'' he said of his ministry.
   Much of the culture budget of past years was spent on Cintarea
Romaniei _ a nearly continuous fest of music, literature and dance
designed to pay homage to the Ceausescus and their narrow vision of
what constitued art.
   The festival has been discontinued, and Plesu announced Saturday
that the ministry would more than double last year's budget of $55
million to $135 million to infuse new life in cultural activities
forced underground under the Ceausescu leadership.
   Plesu said Monday there had been no wholesale purge of his
ministry but main culprits of past excesses had been retired, while
the more than 30-member censor's section had been dissolved.
   Plesu said the cuts had reduced the staff of 180 to about 140,
and he planned to prune it to 90.
   Those remaining need time to adapt to the gentler post-Ceausescu
era, he said.
   ``I needed three days to teach my secretary normal behavior,''
he said. ``She was sullen, she was running around like mad if I
said one word, as if it had been a command.''

   A cult leader facing murder charges in the
slayings of an Ohio family hid out in Southern California for a
month, carrying an assortment of guns and storing ammunition and
paramilitary gear, authorities said Monday.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a defrocked lay minister of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Ohio;
his wife, Alice, 38, and their son, Damon, 19, were expected to be
arraigned Tuesday in Municipal Court on fugitive charges, said San
Diego County Deputy District Attorney John Hewicker.
   Extradition proceedings were expected to follow later. ``They
already have said in their first meeting with investigators that
they would fight extradition,'' Hewicker said.
   The Lundgrens were arrested Sunday outside a motel in National
City about five miles south of San Diego by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents and police.
   A cache of weapons, ammunition and paramilitary equipment
including gas masks were found in a motel room and a storage locker
in nearby Chula Vista.
   Three other Lundgren children _ Kristen, 10, Caleb, 9, and
Jason, 15 _ were taken into protective custody, ATF spokeswoman
April Freud said Monday, declining to elaborate on their
whereabouts.
   ATF agents continued the hunt in Southern California for the
last two of the 13 suspects in the killings of Dennis Avery, his
wife, Cheryl; and their three young daughters. Law enforcement
officers looked for Kathryn Renee Johnson, 36, and Daniel David
Craft, 25, who probably were with Lundgren last week, Freud said.
   ``They were believed to have left San Diego Saturday and they
are in the Southern California area,'' she said.
   In Cleveland, meanwhile, The Plain Dealer reported that Avery
had purchased three weapons for Lundgren three days before his
death.
   Charles E. Wallace, assistant special agent in charge for Ohio
for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said one of
the weapons purchased by Avery, a .45-caliber pistol, may have been
the murder weapon.
   Avery visited a Chagrin Falls, Ohio, gun store last April 15 and
picked out a rifle and two pistols, Wallace told the Plain Dealer
in a story published in Tuesday's editions.
   The following day, Avery returned to the store with LuFdyren,
who signed federal weapons purchase transaction forms, Wallace
said. Avery charged the $1,300 cost to his credit card, Wallace
said.
   Wallace said ballistics tests must be conducted to determine
whether one of the pistols was the murder weapon. Autopsies showed
each of the victims was shot several times with a .45-caliber
weapon.
   One of the weapons seized near San Diego matched a description
of one of the pistols purchased by Avery the day before he died,
Wallace said.
   Freud said Lundgren had been in the San Diego area for at least
a month before his arrest, but didn't know where he'd been staying
or if his family had been with him then.
   Mrs. Lundgren checked into the motel Wednesday night with the
three children, saying she'd been arguing with her husband.
   Searches of the motel room and the locker uncovered numerous
weapons, including two assault rifles, 1,000 rounds of ammunition,
an assortment of knives, several gas masks and gas containers, 40
pounds of powder for reloading ammunition and other types of
paramilitary equipment and camping gear, Freud said.
   ``He seems to have packaged up all his weapons and ammunition
and taken them with him, along with his personal effects,'' she
said. ``It appeared that he kept four firearms with him and kept
the other firearms and various types of paramilitary equipment
stashed somewhere else.
   ``We now will be trying to trace the weapons, trying to
determine who purchased them and the most recent documentation of
who the owners might have been,'' Freud said.
   She said authorities were still trying to determine why Lundgren
was in San Diego since his only tie to the city was Navy service
there 15 years ago.
   Lundgren broke away from the Reorganized Church and persuaded
other members to follow him. The group once lived on a 15-acre farm
near Kirtland, Ohio, where bodies believed to be those of the
Averys were unearthed last week.
   Investigators believe the Averys were killed in April and buried
in a common barn under the barn near the Cleveland-area town the
day before Lundgren and his followers fled to a farm near Holden,
Mo.
   Lundgren and 12 followers were indicted in the killings.
   Authorities were led to the National City motel by telephone
calls made from a pay phone to another location under surveillance,
said Steven C. LaTourette, a prosecutor in Lake County, Ohio.
   LaTourette has said that the Averys apparently were killed in a
sacrificial ritual that would allow the cult to relocate to the
wilderness.
   But Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the
Reorganized Church, said the slayings may have resulted from
disputes over money, sex or fear the Averys would leave the cult.
   Lundgren was stripped of his credentials as a lay minister with
the church in 1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines. He
and others who followed him left the church and eventually settled
on the farm near Kirtland.
   The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
based in Independence, Mo., has roots and some beliefs in common
with the Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church but is separate.

   The heavyweight Vietnam drama ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' was tops at the nation's box offices last weekend,
and the lighthearted ``Little Mermaid'' became the strongest
first-run animated film ever.
   ``Back to the Future Part II,'' meanwhile, passed the $100
million mark at the turnstiles not only in the United States but
overseas. In Japan, the time-travel sequel with Michael J. Fox is
expected to outperform ``Batman'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' combined.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhbitor Relations Co.,
``Born on the Fourth of July'' leaped to No. 1, grossing $11
million in the film's first weekend of wide release.
   The movie starring Tom Cruise as the paraplegic war veteran Ron
Kovic passed ``The War of the Roses'' for the top position.
   ``The War of the Roses,'' directed by Danny DeVito and featuring
Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, collected $7 million for
second place and has now made more than $53 million in five weeks.
   The cop thriller ``Tango &amp; Cash,'' with Kurt Russell and
Sylvester Stallone, sold $6.6 million worth of tickets to finish
third.
   In fourth place was Steven Spielberg's ``Always,'' starring
Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter, with $4.61 million.
   Next was ``The Little Mermaid,'' with $4.59 million. While the
Disney movie has yet to prove itself a longterm moneymaker such as
``Snow White'' and ``Bambi,'' it has now made a record of more than
$56.1 million. The previous record for first-run animated movie was
last year's ``Oliver &amp; Co.,'' which collected $53.3 million worth
of tickets for Disney.
   In sixth place last weekend was the ensemble drama ``Steel
Magnolias'' with $4.5 million. The sequel ``Back to the Future Part
II'' was seventh with $3.7 million.
   ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' fell almost 60 percent
to eighth on $3.3 million. ``Look Who's Talking'' was ninth with
$2.6 million and ``Blaze'' was 10th with $2.3 million.
   In limited release, ``Glory'' had the best per-screen average,
$21,297, for a weekend total of $170,376. ``The Music Box''
averaged $18,905 per screen for a total of $56,714.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations:
   1. ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Universal, $11 million
(weekend gross), 1,310 screens, $8,415 per screen, $12.2 million
(total gross), three weeks in release.
   2. ``The War of the Roses,'' 20th Century Fox, $7 million, 1,525
screens, $4,594 per screen, $53.5 million, five weeks.
   3. ``Tango &amp; Cash,'' Warner Bros., $6.6 million, 1,556 screens,
$4,257 per screen, $31.1 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Always,'' Universal, $4.61 million, 1,124 screens, $4,105
per screen, $20.6 million, three weeks.
   5. ``The Little Mermaid,'' Disney, $4.59 million, 1,521 screens,

<HEAD>Granddaughter of Brigham Young Dies at 102</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Naomi Young Schettler, a granddaughter of
early Mormon Church leader Brigham Young, has died at a local
nursing home after a brief illness with the flu. She was 102.
   Mrs. Schettler recently celebrated her 102nd birthday with
family and friends at the nursing home, telling them, ``Well, I
made it to 102.'' She died Friday.
   The eldest daughter and last survivor of 15 children born to
Joseph Don Carlos and Alice Naomi Dowden Young, she was born Dec.
30, 1887, in Salt Lake City
   When she was 4, she saw her father, an architect for the Salt
Lake Temple, place a statute of the Angel Moroni on top of the
church building.
   Mrs. Schettler taught in all auxiliaries of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints. She was a co-founder of the
Granddaughters of Brigham Young Association and was one of the
original members of the Lindsay Gardens Camp of the Daughters of
Utah Pioneers.
   She ``loved to share a rich story about her heritage. Her real
joy was people. She loved people, and she took great pride in her
family,'' said Sister Mary Ambrose Naughton, executive director of
St. Joseph Villa nursing home where Mrs. Schettler lived.
   She survived three husbands, the last of whom, Orson Schettler,
died in 1968.

<HEAD>Moslem Militancy Again Worrisome for Egyptians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flurry of violent incidents involving
Moslem militants, including an apparent attempt to assassinate a
Cabinet member, is reminding officials that religious extremism
remains a powerful force in Egyptian politics.
   Most worrisome was the Dec. 16 explosion of a truck bomb minutes
before Interior Minister Zaki Badr's motorcade passed. While the
bomb was crudely done, apparently the work of an amateur, it marked
the first time such a weapon was used in Egypt.
   ``Why this new method?'' asked newspaper editor Ibrahim Nafei, a
confidant of President Hosni Mubarak. ``Does this mean the plot was
hatched abroad and executed here in this primitive way?''
   Even Mubarak, normally a paragon of measured calm, professed
concern that the attack bore evidence of the kind of fanatical
conspiracy that killed his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, eight years
ago.
   ``It was not an individual operation,'' the president said.
   Egypt has cause for concern.
   Experts estimate there are 150,000 Islamic activists in Egypt
gathered under the umbrella label of the Islamic Group. At least 10
percent are thought to consider violence acceptable to attain their
fundamentalist goals.
   Generally, they and hundreds of thousands more in the older,
more moderate but still outlawed Moslem Brotherhood demand
implementation of Sharia, Islam's 1,350-year-old legal and ethical
code.
   The government claims 90 percent of the law already encompasses
Sharia and that it's working to change the rest.
   The Brotherhood was born in Egypt in 1928 and has spread through
the Arab world. It turned to violence in the late 1940s in Egypt,
assassinating a prime minister, and was punished brutally for it.
Each of the next two decades saw spurts of religiously based
violence and government suppression.
   Bloodied by vicious reprisals under President Gamal Abdel
Nasser, the Brotherhood disavowed violence in the 1960s. But Sadat,
Nasser's successor, began a crackdown shortly before his death and
the repression has continued, though the Brotherhood itself largely
has been left alone.
   What is causing concern among many watchers of the
fundamentalist scene is the introduction of the booby-trapped truck.
   A researcher who follows religious activism for a Western
embassy said he did not think it was the work of Jihad, or Holy
War, which masterminded the October 1981 assassination of Sadat and
was implicated in a failed coup attempt that followed.
   ``I don't think it was Jihad, because Jihad would have done it
right. They have some military experience. But this could incite
others to follow suit, and it means there's an escalation in the
confrontation,'' said the official, who refused to be identified by
name or nationality.
   Militant violence in Egypt normally finds expression in random
street disturbances, as it did in the coup attempt that followed
Sadat's murder.
   Several such outbreaks have occurred since early December in the
southern town of Assiut, leading to clashes with police that have
injured dozens and have led to hundreds of arrests.
   In the week before the apparent attack on Badr, nearly 500
people were rounded up in Assiut after a fight between police and
militants carrying chains, knives and firearms. Ten police officers
and 30 militants were wounded, many by gunfire, in the fight that
began after police besieged a mosque where the activists had sought
refuge.
   The same type of disturbance occurred Jan. 2, when security
police at Assiut dispersed with tear gas 130 worshipers who tried
to march from a fundamentalist mosque to protest downtown.
   Those reactions to Moslem militancy are typical of security
forces since Badr, a career police officer, took charge of domestic
security in 1986. A Moslem, he ranks among the country's staunchest
campaigners against Islamic militants. He often uses emergency laws
to detain and re-arrest suspects.
   The Western researcher said most Moslem militant leaders are in
prison.
   ``But the bitterness is spreading,'' he said. ``Some people have
been detained 10 times in the past year.''
   Some experts estimate that during certain periods last year,
jails held as many as 6,000 militant fundamentalists at a time.
   That the apparent attempt on Badr's life closely followed the
Assiut conflicts aroused skepticism among some people, even
non-fundamentalists.
   ``It's obviously a government ploy,'' said Ahmed Fouad, an
apolitical Moslem agricultural engineer. ``The limited extent of
damage to the car, and the fact no one was hurt, shows it couldn't
have been real. It obviously was done to give Badr justification
for more arrests.''
   Police arrested a man fleeing the pickup truck as the rear part
of it blew up. The relatively small explosion reportedly was caused
by gunpower electrically detonated by batteries connected to a key
near the ignition.
   Egypt's attorney general banned news stories about the
investigation. But reports published before the blackout named the
suspect as Gamal Mohammed Mustafa, 26, a medical student at Assiut
University who hails from Fayoum.
   Like Assiut, Fayoum is a southern Egypt town known for Moslem
fundamentalist agitation.
   Security sources said 17 other students, mostly Mustafa's
friends who live in Assiut but who hail from the Fayoum area, were
arrested after the assassination attempt. The sources said Mustafa
had been arrested previously, in connection with an attack on a
mixed-sex party at Assiut University in 1988.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas said Tuesday
they attacked Cambodia's capital with grenades and plastic
explosives, killing soldiers and policemen and sending the
president and premier fleeing to Vietnam.
   The reported attack Saturday could not be verified and some
previous Khmer Rouge claims have proved exaggerated. If true, the
siege would be the most serious in Phnom Penh, which has been
largely spared in the 11-year-old war between the guerrillas and
the Vietnamese-installed government.
   The government's SPK news agency, in a report Tuesday monitored
in Bangkok, did not mention any attack, saying Sunday's National
Day celebrations took place in ``total security.'' Saturday and
Monday also were peaceful, it said.
   The guerrillas earlier said they attacked and set ablaze the
second-largest city, Battambang, on Friday and Saturday. A Western
diplomat in Thailand confirmed Tuesday that the town was attacked
but said ``the effect was more psychological than strategic.''
   The Khmer Rouge army radio said resistance forces lobbed five
grenades into the city center near the office of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, killing or wounding some
Vietnamese and ``lackey puppets.''
   ``Vietnamese and puppet leaders fled in panic to save their own
skins,'' said the broadcast, monitored in Bangkok.
   It said the attack took place ``at 0200 on the night of January
6.'' Phnom Penh authorities on Sunday celebrated National Day, the
11th anniversary of the overthrow of Khmer Rouge rule.
   Vietnam invaded Phnom Pehn on Dec. 25, 1978, and drove out the
Khmer Rouge government on Jan. 7, 1979.
   Another Khmer Rouge army broadcast said the guerrillas, aided by
citizens and government officials, attacked the city center and
suburbs Saturday with ``32 grenades and TNT plastic explosives,
killing or wounding some Vietnamese soldiers and puppets who were
drinking near a hotel.
   ``A number of Vietnamese secret agents and puppet policemen
called A3 were also killed by blasts from the grenades and plastic
explosives in the suburbs,'' it said.
   It said Vietnam ``immediately sent (Premier) Hun Sen and
(President) Heng Samrin as well as some other leaders to Ho Chi
Minh City.''
   Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's major southern city, is about 34 miles
east of Cambodia's border province of Svay Rieng.
   The broadcast said Hun Sen was sent from Ho Chi Minh City to
Svay Rieng for his scheduled talks with Australia's deputy foreign
secretary, Michael Costello.
   ``The Vietnamese dared not allow Hun Sen to see Costello in
Phnom Penh because of security reasons,'' it said.
   The official government news agency, SPK, said Monday that
Costello held talks with Hun Sen in Svay Rieng Sunday and Monday.
It is rare for such talks to be held outside the capital.
   Costello's visit was part of a tour to promote Australia's
proposal for the United Nations to govern Cambodia before a general
election.
   (In Paris, diplomatic sources said Monday that representatives
of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members will meet
there Jan. 15-16 to consider ways to bring peace to Cambodia.)
   The Khmer Rouge broadcast said Phnom Penh authorities imposed
tougher martial law measures after ``a number of grenade attacks.''
It said they feared that guerrillas operating in Phnom Penh would
step up activities in coordination with forces outside the city.
   The communist Khmer Rouge has about 30,000 fighters and is the
largest of three guerrilla groups in a resistance coalition. The
Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled
Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and replaced
it with the Heng Samrin government.
   Fears of a possible return to power of the Khmer Rouge have
increased as they have made major battlefield advances since
Vietnam in September made what it called the withdrawal of its last
troops from Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said the guerrillas would keep fighting
and attacking the capital until an international authority verified
Vietnam withdrawal and a coalition government including the Heng
Samrin government and the three guerrilla groups is formed.
   The Khmr Rouge seized the gem-mining town of Pailin in western
Battah"bng province bordering Thailand on Oct. 22.
   They claimed they hit Battambang town starting at midnight
Friday, attacking the 5th Military Region's command there and in
Banteay Meanchey and western Pursat province. An airfield was among
the targets reported hit in Battambang.
   Fighting still raged at dawn Saturday, said a guerrilla radio
broadcast Sunday.
   In an interview broadcast over state radio Sunday, Cambodia's
defense minister Gen. Tea Banh admitted that guerrillas are
advancing in areas near the Thai border, and said his forces are
abandoning some places to concentrate defenses in major towns and
roads.
   ``The enemies have been gradually advancing in their attacks
against a number of our positions along the border. To be sincere,
we have lost some positions,'' he said.
   ``We cannot stay in every village,'' Tea Banh said. ``We have to
abandon some and keep some strategic ones.''
   He did not mention fighting in Phnom Penh or in Battambang town.

<HEAD>Children's Group Sees Progress Fighting Infant Mortality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty of the 50 states are improving their
infant mortality rates enough to meet a federal goal of reducing
nationwide deaths this year to nine per 1,000 live births,
according to a study by the Children's Defense Fund.
   The Washington-based organization, which lobbies on children's
issues, also said only five states have made sufficient progress to
meet the goal of the U.S. surgeon general of reducing the
proportion of low birthweight babies to 5 percent.
   Babies born with low birthweight are 20 times more likely than
other infants to die in infancy and face greater risk of lifelong
disabilities, the report said.
   The report said 10 babies died for every 1,000 live births in
the United States in 1988. That placed the United States 19th among
nations, behind Singapore, Hong Kong, Spain and Ireland, it said.
   The fund ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia on
their improvement in 10 areas of caring for children and the
adequacy of the states' investments in programs benefiting children.
   Six received grades of 50 percent or more _ Vermont 65, Maine
60, Massachusetts and Minnesota 55, and Connecticut and Delaware 50.
   New Mexico received the lowest grade, credited with 10 points of
a possible 100.
   Other scores included California and South Carolina 45 percent;
Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Washington and Wisconsin 40 percent; Alabama, Alaska, Iowa,
Michigan, North Dakota and Virginia 35 percent.
   Others were Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio,
Tennessee and West Virginia 30 percent; the District of Columbia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wyoming 25 percent.
   Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi and Missouri received 20 percent
and Colorado, Idaho, Kansas and South Dakota 15 percent.
   The ratings measured progress in prenatal care, reducing the
proportion of infants born with low birthweights, child poverty,
births to unmarried women, teen birth rates, establishment of
paternity, child poverty, housing affordability, high school
graduation and youth employment.
   Only Alabama, New Hampshire and Vermont demonstrated adequate
progress on six of the 10 measures, the fund said. Arizona and
Maryland each showed no progress, deterioration or inadequate
progress in nine of the 10 areas, it said.
   The report credited New Mexico with the largest percentage
reduction in infant mortality between 1978 and 1988, a drop of 42.6
percent from 14.1 to 8.1 per 1,000 live births.
   Rhode Island was second with a 38.2 percent reduction, from 13.6
to 8.4.
   States not making enough progress to meet the goal set by the
surgeon general were Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New York,
North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee.
   The five states keeping up with the goal for reducing low
birthweight were Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina
and Utah.
   The study also rated the adequacy of state spending on Medicaid
coverage for pregnant women and babies, Medicaid coverage for
children, nutrition supplements, early education supplements, child
care quality, child support enforcement, improvement in benefits
under the aid to families with dependent children program, adequacy
of such benefits compared with housing costs, improving
student-teacher ratios and youth employment initiatives.
   It said five states _ Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota and
Vermont _ made sufficient investments in seven of those 10 areas.
It said Idaho, New Mexico and South Dakota had not invested
sufficiently in any.
   The report called on President Bush to take several steps to
improve the lot of children in the United States.
   It said the president should support child care legislation,
extend Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and families below 200
percent of the federal poverty level, expand food supplements for
all eligible pregnant women, infants and children by 1994, immunize
all children against preventable childhood diseases and reauthorize
Head Start with enough to serve all eligible children with quality
programs by 1994. It estimated the cost of these steps at $3.85
billion.

<HEAD>Experts See Little Impact on Drug Trafficking From Noriega Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fall of Manuel Antonio Noriega will have
little impact on drug trafficking and money laundering, say experts
who contend drug lords changed operations three years ago when the
United States reversed its support of the Panamanian dictator.
   ``In terms of any impact on the flow of drugs or money through
the banking system, the impact of Noriega's arrest will be nil,''
said Rensselaer Lee III, a consultant and lecturer who specializes
in Latin American drug trafficking issues.
   ``I'm talking about the total flow of drugs, the total flow of
money.''
   Scott B. MacDonald, an international economist who has written
two books on the drug trade, refers to the trafficking as the
mythical ``Hydra,'' a many-headed monster reptile: ``Cut off one
head and another head grows in another place.''
   Drug traffickers have looked elsewhere since Panama's usefulness
as a money-laundering center was dimmed in 1987, and the Central
American nation was never a major transit point for drugs anyway,
the experts say.
   ``They pretty much gutted the banking system in terms of total
asset size,'' MacDonald said, referring to the impact of the U.S.
campaign against Noriega's regime. ``The assets drained out of the
country. Legitimate business wanted to get out of Panama, and the
people who stayed in Panama doing business came under greater
scrutiny.''
   With Noriega gone, what little money-laundering activity is left
can be expected to move to the places others went before, he said,
citing Anguilla in the Caribbean; Montserrat, a British crown
Caribbean colony; and Paraguay and Uruguay as new money-laundering
centers.
   The routes for shipping drugs also have changed, he said.
   Drugs now go ``through Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and
Europe,'' he said. ``Some of it still goes to North America, but
Europe is increasingly considered an open market. The perception is
that North America is becoming a saturated market.'' Drug
traffickers, who also move their product through Brazil and
Guatemala, are looking forward to changes in the European community
in 1992, when the borders will open, making their work easier on
that continent, he said.
   But this was all happening before the Jan. 3 arrest of Noriega,
touted by the Bush administration as a blow against drug
trafficking.
   The downfall of Noriega _ who was indicted by federal grand
juries in February 1988 _ ``inconveniences the Colombians no doubt
some, but nothing that's going to make any noticeable difference to
America's drug problems,'' said Peter Reuter of The Rand Corp.
   ``No one ever said that Panama was the exclusive, or even the
dominant laundry,'' Reuter said. ``Laundries are available in a lot
of places.''
   The Drug Enforcement Administration is pleased Panama may become
an ally rather than an enemy in the drug war, but doesn't expect
the drug trade to collapse or even show signs of distress because
of Noriega's arrest.
   ``No single event, no matter how significant it is, will result
in the immediate impact on availability of drugs in the United
States,'' said Frank Shults of the DEA. ``At this point, we are not
in a position to speculate on the long-term possibilities.
   ``There are numerous financial centers throughout the world,''
Shults said. ``Drug traffickers are very flexible in their ability
to move their money. They will no doubt exploit whatever markets
they are able to.''
   Panama was a transit point for the drugs themselves, but ``not
by any means a substantial amount,'' he said.
   However, he said, ``this was a major sanctuary for the
traffickers to use, and a haven for money laundering. They are out
looking for other markets.''
   MacDonald said Noriega's ouster and arrest has had one important
impact:
   ``With Noriega gone, the one man in Panama who would very much
allow the narco trafficantes safe haven is gone. I think that is
crucial. It means that the Medellin (cocaine cartel) people cannot
suddenly disappear into Panama and not have to worry about it.''

   Don Henley and Glenn Frey have settled a
decade-old feud and will reunite the Eagles, the popular band that
epitomized California rock music in the 1970s, according to a trade
publication.
   The singer-songwriters will regroup this spring to record an
album, the Hollywood Reporter said Monday. The album likely would
be followed with a concert tour, the newspaper said.
   It wasn't clear if other former Eagles members would reunite
with Henley and Frey. Joe Walsh, Don Felder and Timothy B. Schmit
were in the band when the Eagles broke up in 1981.
   Henley, 42, was touring in Japan on Monday in support of his
Geffen Records ``The End of Innocence'' album. Frey, 41, records
for MCA Records.
   The nature of the feud wasn't disclosed.
   Telephone calls placed Monday to Irving Azoff and Larry Solters,
the Eagles' old management team, weren't returned.
   The Eagles won three Grammy Awards, including best record in
1977 for ``Hotel California.'' They won the group pop vocal Grammy
in 1975 for ``Lyin' Eyes'' and the group rock vocal Grammy in 1979
for ``Heartache Tonight.''

   The Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder, a
former aide to President Nixon who spent seven years in prison for
the Watergate scandal, said his life bottomed out when he started
treating Nixon like God.
   Magruder, executive minister of the First Community Church of
Columbus, Ohio, was a special assistant to Nixon and deputy
campaign director for the Committee for the Reelection of the
President in 1972.
   He helped cover up the Watergate scandal.
   ``After I left Washington, my life was a shambles. My marriage
fell apart. There was so much pain,'' Magruder, 54, told 100
worshipers Monday at Westminster College.
   Watergate came about because ``we started to treat Nixon not as
president but as God,'' he said.
   Magruder said it's possible to come back after a crisis, but
it's not easy.
   ``I am reminded of one of the shortest speeches Winston
Churchill ever gave,'' he said. ``When Churchill was asked how
England would survive the German threat, he told them in six words,
`Never, never, never, never give up.' That is a philosophy I live
by and it works.''

   Dixie Carter of CBS-TV's ``Designing Women''
says working on a prime-time series is a ``piece of cake'' compared
to the years she spent on the popular daytime soap ``Edge of
Night.''
   ``Soap acting is the toughest acting there is,'' said the
actress in the this week's TV Guide magazine. ``It's positively
Herculean, that is when it's not totally terrifying.''
   Ms. Carter, who will be co-host at next week's Soap Opera
Awards, made her TV debut in 1974 as Assistant District Attorney
Brandy Henderson on the soap when it was recorded live.
   ``I was always fretting about something. What if the door gets
stuck? What if my tears are too facile? What if I can't remember my
speech in front of the jury?''
   ``In comparison, a sitcom is a piece of cake,'' she said.

   Singer-songwriter Prince will be honored
during the American Music Awards presentations this month with a
special Award of Achievement for his contributions to music.
   A tribute to Prince will occur during the Jan. 22 ABC-TV awards
show from the Shrine Auditorium. Prince, 30, is the second Award of
Achievement recipient. Michael Jackson got it last year.
   An inscription on Prince's trophy said the musician ``through
his writing and performing, his recordings and motion pictures and
his discovery and support of new musical stars, has been a major
influence on the look and sounds of the 1980s.''
   Prince is perhaps best known for his ``Purple Rain'' album and
motion picture, as well as music for the film ``Batman.''

   Comedian-activist Dick Gregory and two other
people declined to post bail and were being held in jail after
being arrested at an anti-drug paraphernalia demonstration at a
convenience store, police said.
   The protest was their second Monday at the Smoke Connection,
where pipes for cocaine and marijuana and other items are sold. In
the first protest, Gregory was among seven people arrested and
released after received citations for trespassing.
   Late Monday, police said Gregory, 57; the Rev. George Clements,
57, of Chicago; and Robert Brown, 54, of Milwaukee returned to the
store to continue the protest. They were being held after declining
to pay bail, authorities said.
   The three were expected to appear in Municipal Court today.
   The sale of drug paraphernalia currently is legal in Wisconsin
although lawmakers have passed a measure that could outlaw such
sales. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   In the first demonstration, protesters included Clements and the
Rev. Michael Pfleger, two Chicago priests who oppose the sale of
drug paraphernalia and have participated in similar demonstrations.

<HEAD>Lawmakers See Panama Aid Limited by Budget Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama may be looking for far more money to
rebuild its crippled economy than the United States can afford,
according to lawmakers who visited the Central American country.
   Panamanian Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon suggested an
initial one-year aid contribution of $1.5 billion to help repair
damage caused by the Dec. 20 American invasion, a House member said
Monday.
   ``Obviously, we can and should help ease the immediate suffering
caused by the invasion,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who
called destruction in poor neighborhoods of Panama City
``terrible.''
   ``We should provide medical supplies, shelter, food and other
basic human needs,'' Studds said. ``But beyond that, our abilities
are limited, and we should say so.''
   Arias Calderon's $1.5 billion estimate would be 10 percent of
the total U.S. budget for aiding dozens of nations, and it's
unlikely the United States can come up with such an amount in
direct cash assistance.
   Several Democratic lawmakers who took a two-day trip to Panama
last week said they are not inclined to cut domestic programs to
send aid, and sought to pressure President Bush to justify the new
spending and find the money.
   ``In the days ahead, the president, whose invasion this was,
will have a responsibility to explain to the American people how
much aid is necessary, what it will accomplish, and how it will be
paid for,'' Studds said in a statement.
   ``These are important questions because I, for one, am not about
to take money away from American schools or housing or medical
research to send to Panama.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said it was more likely that U.S. aid
will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, spread over several
years, and that some aid will come in the form debt forgiveness and
loan guarantees rather than cash aid.
   Some aid may also have to come from other countries, he said.
   A 30-member House delegation met with Panamanian government and
business leaders Thursday and Friday to assess how much aid is
needed to restore what had been one of the region's healthiest
economies, crippled by economic sanctions in the effort to force
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega from power.
   ``The invasion and the current occupation by American troops
have turned a Panamanian problem, the burden of having a corrupt
and cruel ruler, into an American problem,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., a member of the visiting group.
   No formal aid proposal has been made, and Deputy Treasury
Secretary John E. Robson insisted Monday that no dollar amounts
were discussed when a high-level executive branch delegation met
with the same leaders last week in Panama City.
   But Edwards said Arias Calderon suggested the $1.5 billion
figure as a ``first installment'' in a long-term rebuilding package.
   He acknowledged that Panamanians support the U.S. action, but
added: ``It is entirely possible ... that some of this good will
will dissipate when the Panamanians find out that Uncle Sam will
not provide all the billions it will take to repair the damage,
rebuild the hundreds of destroyed houses and bring the economy to a
high level.''
   Robson said a joint Treasury-State Department task force was
working on proposals for aiding Panama but declined to discuss
specific steps that might be taken. He said Panamanians realize
their first priority must be to restore investor confidence.
   He hinted that the administration will rely heavily on
private-sector efforts to rebuild the Panamanian economy,
suggesting U.S. aid would be used to leverage private investment.
   ``The underpinning of the Panamanian economic recovery plan
rests on the private sector,'' Robson said at a news conference. He
added the United States may look in part to ``other governments
that have an interest in Panama'' for direct aid.

   A congressional committee's eight-day trip to
Hawaii comes in the dead of winter, but the congresswoman who
arranged the excursion denies it's another political junket to a
warm, tropical locale.
   ``We do have problems in paradise,'' Rep. Patricia Saiki,
D-Hawaii, said after the first hearing in Hawaii on Monday by the
House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.
   The memorandum from the chairman of the committee says the
purpose of the trip is to examine national ocean and coastal policy.
   One day's itinerary, however, details a different type of
January excursion.
   ``9:30 a.m. Depart hotel for Sand Point Container Yard to tour
Matson Navigation Facilities _ approximately two hours.
   ``11:30 a.m. Return to hotel. Afternoon free.
   ``5:30 p.m. Depart hotel for cocktails and dinner John Dominis
Restaurant. Dress: Aloha Casual.''
   Saiki, who persuaded the committee chairman and a handful of her
panel colleagues to make the trip, bristles at a suggestion that
it's a respite for members of Congress while the rest of the nation
shivers through the winter.
   ``Personally I'm tired and distressed by describing this visit
as a junket. I think it's a bum rap,'' Saiki said in a telephone
interview from her Hawaii office.
   The congresswoman said the panel is looking at ``these really
heavy duty issues that affect the economy and environment'' in
Hawaii, including fishing rights, ocean mining and the territorial
seas.
   ``The agenda is a very full one and the committee members are
working. They're getting an earful from my people of Hawaii and how
the decision-making affects us.''
   Saiki said the temperate Pacific setting for the hearings should
not dissuade observers that they are significant.
   Saiki and three lawmakers from the 43-member committee, two
spouses and two other House members are on the fact-finding mission
that began Friday with departure from Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington aboard a naval DC-9 military aircraft.
   Rep. Walter B. Jones, D-N.C., the panel's chairman, said in a
Dec. 15 memo that the Defense Department assigned Navy personnel to
escort the delegation aboard the military plane to Honolulu. The
Pentagon had no immediate comment on the trip Monday.
   There was no immediate estimate available on the cost of the
trip.
   The itinerary for Jan. 5-13 includes a two-hour tour of Pearl
Harbor, a visit to a geophysical monitoring station in Mauna Loa
and morning hearings Monday and today on ``U.S. Oceans and Coastal
Management Issues in the Pacific.''
   The remainder of the proposed itinerary is heavy on free time
and evening receptions.
   On Sunday, the schedule called for Hawaii Gov. John D. Waihee
III to toast the lawmakers at a cocktail reception at his mansion.
Dress was coat and tie. The next day called for dinner at the
Halekulani Hotel, with Matson Navigation as the host and dress
described as ``aloha casual.''
   Tonight, the lawmakers were to dine Japanese-style at a evening
sponsored by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management
Council. Dress, again, was ``aloha casual.''
   According to committee staff, the delegation includes Jones,
Saiki and Reps. Thomas J. Manton, D-N.Y., and William O. Lipinski,
D-Ill. Manton's wife, Diane, and Lipinski's wife, Rose Marie, also
made the trip.
   Joining the delegation were Rep. Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii, and
Rep. Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, D-American Samoa, a non-voting delegate
to Congress.
   Among the topics for the hearings and meetings were
reauthorization of the Coastal Zone Management Act, the 200-mile
fishing zone and regulation of tuna in that area, mineral resources
leasing in a 100-mile zone and the territorial seas of the United
States, a staff member said Monday.
   Scheduled witnesses included Waihee, legislators from American
Samoa and Guam and private individuals.
   After tours Friday morning in Kona, the schedule includes:
   ``12:30 p.m. Return to hotel.
   ``Afternoon-Evening free.
   ``Optional luau at hotel.''

   Simplicity can be spectacular and a long opera
can seem short when it's Mozart's wonderful ``Cosi fan tutte,''
performed as radiantly as it was at its first Metropolitan Opera's
presentation of this season.
   ``Cosi'' on Monday night was conducted by James Levine and the
orchestral music sang as sweetly as the singers.
   The main foursome, Carol Vaness and Tatiana Troyanos as sisters
and Thomas Hampson and Jerry Hadley as the naval officers they're
engaged to, have voices of about equal weight _ medium robust _ and
are all attractive looking. All voices blended well. The voices of
Miss Vaness and Hadley have rare beauty.
   Hampson's baritone is attractive and sounds easily produced.
Miss Troyanos' mezzo-soprano is confident and she displayed a comic
touch, getting laughs where some mezzos don't but maybe going too
far in lurching around the stage with a butterfly net.
   ``Cosi'' isn't heavy with plot. An elderly cynic bets the men
that their ladies can be proved inconstant. The men dress like a
vision of Ali Baba and, as ``Albanians,'' woo each other's
fiancees. Bass Richard Van Allan performed the cynic _ who wins the
bet _ as elegant and worldly wise. He sang well but weakened toward
the end of the opera.
   ``Cosi'' is light hearted but Miss Vaness and Hadley each have
one serious aria in Act 2. Both sang with affecting emotion.
   Margaret Price was scheduled to sing Fiordiligi but was ill and
replaced by Miss Vaness. Dawn Upshaw was scheduled to sing the
maid. Her announced replacement, Hei-Kyung Hong, became ill. Betsy
Norden sang the maid, pert and clear-voiced.
   The simple sets, new in 1982, are inside a frame smaller than
the Met Opera stage. Side panels are turned to show trees for park
scenes or wallpaper for scenes inside a room. Back panels slide in
and out. Furniture is carried in and out by stagehands in peaked
caps like elves. The two men ``leave for war'' and return in a
small boat of the type in which Washington crossed the Delaware.
Lighting by Gil Wechsler is cheerfully bright.
   Some think ``Cosi,'' with only six characters and very
occasional chorus of townspeople, shouldn't be performed in a house
as big as the Met. If that idea were followed, the Met audience
would be greatly deprived.

   A Polaroid camera is the weapon of
choice for the leftist Sandinista Front on the 1990 campaign trail.
Their foes have picked a guitar player and a burro to drive home
their political pitch.
   Just seven weeks before election day and after a Christmas
hiatus punctuated by the U.S. invasion of Panama, Nicaragua's
political parties are at it again.
   The candidates are kissing babies, pressing the flesh and
slinging mud at each other in a crescendo of politicking that will
climax with the Feb. 25 balloting.
   A billboard showing President Daniel Ortega hugging one of his
children has popped up on a Managua street corner. Ortega, running
for re-election with Vice President Sergio Ramirez, is now visiting
cities for the second time in the campaign.
   Peasants at rallies fight over who will have their picture taken
next to Ortega. A Polaroid camera clicks, the print slides out and
the peasant goes home with a portrait of himself standing right
next to the smiling president.
   For its party, the opposition coalition has hired composer
Pompilio Amaya, who delights crowds at rallies with his songs,
accompanied by his a guitar. Then there's Pancho the Burro, who
wears a cap with the coalition's acronym written on it and is
paraded before rallies.
   Publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the opposition
presidential candidate, fell in her home last week and fractured a
knee. She is laid up in a Houston hospital for at least another 10
days.
   But her running mate, Virgilio Godoy of the Liberal Independent
Party, is on the campaign trail and became hoarse over the weekend
from his many public speeches. Godoy, a lawyer and college
professor, is a more polished speaker than Mrs. Chamorro, whose
political experience is limited.
   Ortega has tactfully avoided targeting Mrs. Chamorro's perceived
lack of great intellectual capacity. Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a civic leader whose image is in a constant
tug-of-war between the Sandinistas and the 14-party National
Opposition Union.
   Nicaraguans might construe any personal attack on Mrs. Chamorro
as an attack on her late husband _ a political taboo.
   Real issues abound: the dismal state of the economy and how to
correct it, the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, the draft, regional
guerrilla movements and relations with Washington and Moscow.
   Neither the Sandinistas nor the opposition has changed the
substance of its message over Christmas. The Sandinistas blame the
United States for nearly all the country's ills; the opposition
blames the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas also claim the opposition is getting U.S.
funding. The Americans and the opposition both deny it, though Mrs.
Chamorro has visited with U.S. officials.
   The frenzy of political graffiti that gripped the city a few
months back has subsided. Perhaps that is partly because the
Supreme Electoral Council, the final arbiter of the election
process, has begun urging Nicaraguans to respect each other and
partly because there are few walls left to scrawl on.
   But street artists, ever resourceful, have claimed the ground.
Their messages can now be seen on the pavement of highways,
driveways and sidewalks. Even utility poles bear civic messages
favoring political parties.
   The U.S. invasion of Panama on Dec. 20 has given the Sandinistas
an unforeseen campaign coup: it has allowed them to whip up
nationalist sentiment and gather it around the party. It also has
given them fuel for further identifying the opposition coalition as
a puppet of Washington and the Sandinista Front as the only hope
for a sovereign Nicaragua.
   Yet the Sandinista campaign slogan, ``Everything Will Be
Better,'' is falling on increasingly cynical ears. Prices for
staples keep increasing; salaries barely keep up.
   The opposition coalition _ hemmed together from parties ranging
from conservatives to communists _ has problems of its own.
   The parties' only common denominator is that they hate the
Sandinistas enough to stick together _ at least until an electoral
victor is declared. That raises the question of how harmonious a
government the alliance could form.
   Most polls released over the past few months show Ortega ahead
of Mrs. Chamorro, who has the advantage of owning the opposition
newspaper La Prensa to help in her campaign. The Sandinistas have
Barricada, the Front's official paper; and the pro-government daily
El Nuevo Diario.
   Other poll results show Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro in a
neck-to-neck race.
   A telling item in any of the polls, however, is the percentage
of undecideds, who constitute nearly as many people as those those
who say they will vote for Ortega or for Mrs. Chamorro.

   Although many thousands of
suspected government opponents have been murdered by military men _
in the ``death squads'' or independent of them _ not a single
officer has been convicted of human rights abuses in 10 years of
civil war.
   No military man had been indicted until March 1989, when a
major, a 2nd lieutenant and seven soldiers were accused of killing
10 peasants in the hamlet of San Francisco in September 1988. That
case since has bogged down.
   ``The government's near paralysis in the San Francisco killings
is merely the latest in a long line of failures to hold members of
the armed forces accountable for political violence,'' the New
York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said in a report last
year.
   ``In thousands of cases, dating back to the 1980 assassination
of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the Salvadoran military has
refused to assist prosecutions. In many cases senior military
officers have blatantly interfered with investigations or
prosecutions, preventing them from being carried out,'' the report
said.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, who announced Sunday that military
men committed the Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priests and two
women, contends the era of impunity is over.
   He did not specify who was implicated in the crime, their
numbers or their ranks, but he announced a blue-ribbon commission
would assist the investigation ``to deduce responsibilities and
make sure justice is done.''
   He promised punishment would be meted out ``down to the last
person implicated.''
   ``El Salvador's judicial system is dangerously close to
collapse,'' said the Laywers Committee.
   That appraisal is shared by U.S. authorities, including
Ambassador William Walker, who says flat out, ``The judiciary does
not work.''
   The few cases that get prosecuted are those that receive wide
publicity, affect U.S. public opinion and cause a stir on Capitol
Hill.
   ``High profile cases are prosecuted for political reasons,
rather than reasons of justice,'' said a Western diplomat. ``But
that they get prosecuted at all is progress.''
   The Jesuit slayings shocked El Salvador and the world and
prompted calls in the U.S. Congress for reappraisal of U.S. aid.
The virtually bankrupt nation has received $4 billion in economic
and military assistance from Washington during the past 10 years.
   ``There are consequences of human rights violations in the
future,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said during a visit to El
Salvador in February 1989. ``Democracy means human rights and
decency. You cannot have one without the other. Our commitment and
our support are conditioned on this process and this system.''
   Of the many cases unsuccessfully prosecuted, several stand out.
The most glaring could be the case of Romero's assassination on
March 24, 1980.
   After a decade of political manipulation, the case is virtually
closed, with no one convicted or punished in connection with it.
   The previous Christian Democratic administration of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte said it knew who planned the killing and who
carried it out. It claimed the opposition-controlled legislature
impeded prosecution to protect implicated members of the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena, including party founder
Roberto D'Aubuisson.
   D'Aubuisson and Arena, which won last year's presidential
election, deny any involvement in the archbishop's murder.
   On Jan. 3, 1981, two U.S. land reform advisers and the head of
the Salvadoran land reform insitute were murdered in the Sheraton
Hotel. Two triggermen, both National Guard corporals, eventually
were convicted and sentenced. But the two officers they both named
as the instigators of the crime were not convicted.
   About 50 residents of the town of Armenia were massacred July
30, 1981, by civil guardsmen, according to church and human rights
groups. Whether the implicated soldiers should be covered by a 1987
amnesty is still being considered by the courts, and no one has
been convicted in the slayings.
   On Feb. 22, 1983, about 70 Indian peasants of the Las Hojas
agricultural cooperative were killed by troops of the 6th military
detachment in the western province of Sonsonate. Those implicated,
including three officers, were absolved under the 1987 amnesty.
   From 1984 to 1987, rights abuses steadily decreased.
Humanitarian organizations were alarmed when they rose in 1988. The
situation continued to degenerate in 1989.
   The trend established in the first six months of 1989 indicated
the number of politically motivated murders easily would surpass
those in 1988.

   The bodyslamming behemoths of professional
wrestling are entertainers and not athletes, according to the
Legislature.
   The state Assembly voted 44-4 Monday to approve a bill that
would reduce the regulation on those growling, scowling giants by
removing professional wrestling from the jurisdiction of the state
Athletic Commission.
   The bill, passed by the state Senate in February, awaits action
by Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   Supporters including the World Wrestling Federation say the
measure will reduce the overhead of promoting a wrestling
exhibition in New Jersey, and therefore make it easier for fans to
see warriors such as Hulk Hogan and Rowdy Roddy Piper in person.
   But wrestlers paid a price for the victory by admitting the
contests are less than spontaneous.
   The World Wrestling Federation, which asked for the bill, first
admitted that professional wrestling was more entertainment than
sport in a Trenton legislative hearing in early 1989.
   The federation described wrestling as ``an activity in which
participants struggle hand-in-hand primarily for the purpose of
providing entertainment for spectators rather than conducting a
bonafide athletic contest.''
   The statement was blasted by several New Jersey professional
wrestlers who insisted that theirs is not a cream puff job.
   But the federation's position won out, partly because it wants
easier access to the lucrative New Jersey market, which includes
the Atlantic City casinos.

should be the accordion because of its rich history here and
because it was invented here,'' said Tom Torriglia, a band member
leading the effort.
   Besides, said Torriglia of the instrument, ``It's a good way to
meet girls.''

<HEAD>Baker to Hold Arms Talks in Moscow Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
hold talks in Moscow next month to try to clear the way for a new
treaty with the Soviet Union sharply reducing long-range nuclear
missiles, Bush administration officials disclosed.
   Baker also is considering a visit to Prague after the Feb. 6-7
meeting to demonstrate U.S. support for the peaceful transition in
Czechoslovakia from a hard-line Communist government to a more
moderate regime, the officials told The Associated Press on Monday.
   He may stop in other East and Central European countries as
well, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The trip to Moscow is one of three sessions Baker intends to
hold with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before a
June U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Washington.
   The projected centerpiece of the summit is a treaty to slash
U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range bombers, submarines and
missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   The most complex of the three obstacles Baker will try to
overcome with Shevardnadze concerns how long-range air-launched
cruise missiles carried by bombers should be counted against a
treaty limit of 6,000 strategic warheads.
   The two other issues are the kind of data from missile tests
that could be disguised and where surplus, or non-deployed
missiles, would be stored.
   Even settling those three issues would not wrap up the new
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would like to sign at the Washington
summit.
   For instance, the two sides are in sharp disagreement at the
negotiating table in Geneva over sea-launched cruise missiles.
Bush, at the Malta summit last month, resisted Gorbachev's efforts
to curb the elusive weapon, which is carried on submarines and
surface vessels.
   The Soviets still are trying to slow down or trim the U.S.
Strategic Defense Initiative, which would place nuclear weapons
into space as part of a defense against a ballistic missile attack.
   However, the Soviets may be willing to set aside those two
disputes, which would mean that resolving the three other problems
would be a major step toward completing the pact.
   A stop in Prague would be scheduled by Baker after his talks in
Moscow and before his arrival Feb. 13 in Ottawa for an East-West
conference on Bush's ``open skies'' proposal, the officials said.
   The 16 NATO countries and the seven members of the Warsaw Pact
meet in the Canadian capital to discuss allowing unarmed aircraft
to fly over their territory in search of suspected military
activity.
   Baker visited East Germany last month, demonstrating support for
the reformist Communist government. He also went to Poland and
Hungary with Bush in July.
   Czechoslovakia's shift to a more moderate system has occurred
without the strife evident in Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria.
Baker may be prepared to offer U.S. aid if it is requested.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler, asked about
Baker's travel plans, said only that he would be going to the
Soviet Union ``later this year.''

<HEAD>Democrats Not Rejecting Capital Gains Tax Cut Out of Hand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders in Congress aren't rushing
to embrace President Bush's renewed bid for a cut in capital gains
taxes, but neither are they rejecting it out of hand.
   ``We'll have to see what the specific proposals are,'' said a
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
who led last year's successful fight against a reduction.
   Mitchell, his spokesman said, has not ruled out supporting a cut.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, ``pledged late last year to consider a capital gains cut
as part of a package of saving and investment incentives,'' Bentsen
spokesman Jack DeVore said Monday.
   Bush, who campaigned for president in 1988 on a pledge to reduce
taxes on capital gains, renewed the battle in a speech Monday to
the American Farm Bureau in Orlando, Fla. A reduction, he said,
would boost investment and create jobs.
   ``For us to reap the full benefits of a competitive economy, we
must cut the capital-gains tax rate,'' Bush told a cheering
audience. ``Passage of our capital-gains proposal, which would
apply to the sale of farmland, will be one of my top priorities in
this legislative year.''
   Bush listed enactment of clean-air and anti-crime legislation
among his priorities.
   ``It is past time for Congress to tend to some of the unfinished
business,'' Bush said.
   With the backing of one of every four Democrats and an almost
solid bloc of Republicans, the House last year approved a
Bush-supported cut in taxes on capital gains, profits from the sale
of investments. The proposal died in the Senate when Republicans
fell nine votes short of the 60 needed to cut off a Democratic
filibuster against it.
   Democratic leaders in the House and Senate opposed the cut on
three counts.
   They cited estimates that 80 percent of the benefit would go to
those with incomes over $100,000 a year; they said the reduction
would strike a major blow against the landmark 1986 tax overhaul
that ended preferential treatment of capital gains; and they
rejected Bush's contention that a reduction would generate so much
investment that government revenues would actually increase.
   In his brief remarks on the issue Monday, Bush mentioned neither
the revenue implications nor the 1986 tax law.
   But on the third point, he said: ``I am sick and tired of the
demagogues who call this a tax cut for the rich. It means jobs, it
means savings and it is good for all Americans.''
   A Mitchell spokesman noted that the majority leader supported a
lower capital gains tax when Congress was debating the 1986
overhaul.
   Mitchell ``has said he will continue to support one if it meets
three criteria: If it doesn't adversely affect the budget deficit,
if it is targeted and if it is part of a fair and progressive tax
structure,'' the spokesman said.
   That third condition could mean that Bush and Mitchell will
continue to be at odds over capital gains.
   Mitchell's definition of a ``fair and progressive tax
structure'' has been one that would mean a higher income tax rate
for high-income Americans _ the kind of tax increase that the
administration has vowed to oppose.
   Bush is expected to provide details of his capital gains
proposal in the budget that he will send to Congress on Jan. 29.
Some key Republicans are expecting the new plan to provide a
greater tax benefit for longer-held assets, rather than to give the
same incentive to all property.
   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates that
apply to wages and other income. In his budget last year, Bush
recommended that 45 percent of capital gains from selected assets _
specifically excluding farmland and timber, for example _ be
excluded from tax.
   The House voted instead for a plan that, for 2\ years, would
have excluded from tax 30 percent of the gain on a broader list of
assets, including farmland and timber. After that time, only the
gain caused solely by inflation would have been taxed.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, tried to block approval of the cut last year.
Spokesman Jim Jaffe said Monday that Rostenkowski is wary of any
new proposed reduction, but expects it would take a unified
Democratic effort to defeat it.

<HEAD>Engineer Solves Toilet Stench Mystery for Forest Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Diaper Ban, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIMAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Briar Cook is savoring the sweet smell
of success. The U.S. Forest Service engineer has solved the
longstanding problem of getting the stench out of the stalls at
wilderness restrooms.
   Delighted administrators in Washington, D.C., have formally
declared 1990 ``The Year of the Sweet-Smelling Toilet,'' and plan
to retrofit all 12,000 toilets in use on Forest Service land
nationwide.
   Another 300 new latrines built annually will incorporate Cook's
breakthrough findings, which followed years of research at a Forest
Service lab northeast of Los Angeles.
   ``The public today expects a higher level of service and more
amenities, and part of that is a good-smelling toilet,'' said
Richard Woodrow, the Forest Service's acting director of
recreation. ``Well, we're going to give it to them.''
   Within three years, officials say, Americans won't find a single
smelly latrine in any of their 134 national forests. Costs are
estimated at up to $1,500 each for the retrofitted toilets.
   Cook's other research projects at the San Dimas Technology and
Development Center have included ways to bear-proof garbage cans,
but he says he considers toilets his best work.
   ``Our society is funny about toilets _ no one wants to talk
about them,'' he said. ``But the odor problem affects a lot of
people. As an engineer, I view it as a challenge.''
   Cook found that the basic design of national forest toilets
prevented adequate ventilation. He also determined that vent stacks
were being clogged by undiscovered spider webs.
   Through tests in a wind tunnel, Cook showed that a wider vent
stack stretching much higher above the roof line greatly improves
the expulsion of odors. Solar-powered fans also help pull the fetid
air from the chamber, he found.
   As for why no one else noticed the contributing spider web
problem, Cook said: ``Nobody likes these little cabanas, so why
would they go crawling around inside them? It's in and out, as fast
as possible. Nobody ever bothered to look in that stack.''
   The problem of ridding forestland toilets of their odor had
stumped many before Cook. Gripes about smelly toilets have been
common since the first national forest outhouse was installed in
the early 1900s, Woodrow said.
   For decades, restroom odor has been the No. 1 complaint received
by rangers from California to New Hampshire, he said, leading to a
common conclusion.
   ``We figured that toilets stink, period. Take it or leave it,''
Woodrow said.
   But the tenacious Cook proved them wrong. He said he hopes
ultimately to share his design with the National Park Service, the
Army Corps of Engineers and other public lands managers, all
plagued with pungent potties.
   ``It's a universal problem,'' Cook said.

   Two disc jockeys brought a 15-foot replica
of Elvis Presley's head to Graceland, the dead singer's former
residence, on the day he would have turned 55. Graceland managers
were not pleased.
   The head, which had been part of a float in the Tournament of
Roses Parade, briefly joined fans gathered outside the
white-columned residence Monday. Presley died of heart disease at
the mansion on Aug. 16, 1977.
   About 1,500 people representing 40 Presley fan clubs from around
the world came to Memphis to mark the birthday, said Patsy
Andersen, fan club liaison for the Graceland Division of Elvis
Presley Enterprises. Some fans cut a cake and sang happy birthday.
   The disc jockeys who brought the replica head, Brian Phelps and
Marc Thompson of station KLOS in Los Angeles, were permanently
banned from Graceland last year for using hidden microphones to
broadcast from inside the residence, Graceland spokesman Todd
Morgan said.
   Carey Curelop, program manager for the radio station, said the
disc jockeys brought the head to Memphis as a ``peace offering.''
But Graceland managers told the announcers to take the head and
move on.
   Morgan said the parade float had been ``a beautiful tribute'' to
Presley.
   ``They've taken that and changed it and turned it into something
distasteful. It's really sad,'' Morgan said.
   The disc jockeys took the flatbed truck carrying the head to a
nearby parking lot and broadcast for about an hour, Curelop said
from Los Angeles.
   The head was part of a float sent to the Rose Parade by the
state of Mississippi. It was taken to Jackson, Miss., after the
stop in Memphis, Curelop said. Presley was born in Tupelo, Miss.

<HEAD>Commercial Banks Seeing More Bad Loans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Commercial banks already reeling from soft
real estate markets in the Northeast and other regions are
beginning to suffer from a increase in sour consumer loans, a
regulator says.
   ``We are concerned about a significant rise in non-performing
consumer loans at banks around the country,'' said Comptroller of
the Currency Robert L. Clarke, the chief regulator of nationally
chartered banks.
   Clarke, in a speech to the Institute of International Bankers on
Monday, said his agency had not determined whether the problem is
confined to one region or if it is a risk to the entire banking
system.
   However, statistics compiled by a banking trade group show
consumer loan problems concentrated in New York and several New
England states, the same areas where lackluster real estate markets
are causing banks loan problems.
   ``We are analyzing the data and trying to determine precisely
what this implies for the overall condition of the national banking
system,'' Clarke said. He delivered his speech in New York City. A
copy was released in Washington.
   On other topics, Clarke predicted the trend toward bank
consolidation would continue. He said about 11,000 banks would
exist at the end of 1992, compared with 12,600 now and 14,400 in
1980. He also said more banks would be owned by foreigners in
coming years.
   The American Bankers Association, a trade group representing
commercial banks, reported last month that the number of consumers
30 days or more behind on their loans soared to a 10-year high in
the July-September quarter.
   Nationally, 2.88 percent of the loans surveyed at 800 banks were
delinquent on Sept. 30, compared with 2.3 percent three months
earlier. The delinquency rate was greater than 4 percent in four
states: Connecticut, 6.05 percent; Vermont, 5.35 percent;
Massachusetts, 4.8 percent; and New York, 4.44 percent.
   The economies of some Northeastern states have been in the
doldrums, in part because the 1987 stock market crash depressed
employment in the financial service industry, including brokerage
firms, banks and insurance companies.
   At the same time that consumer lending is becoming more chancy,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. statistics show that banks are
becoming more involved in it.
   Loans to individuals grew by 5.2 percent from the third quarter
of 1988 to the same period of 1989, according to the FDIC. That's
slightly higher than the 4.2 percent growth rate for all banks'
assets, but far below the 13.1 percent growth for real estate loans.
   Loans to individuals represented 12 percent of banks' $3.2
trillion in assets at the end of the third quarter. Consumer loans
made up 5.9 percent of all bad assets.
   Economist Paul Getman of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
consulting company, said banks face a growing problem with what he
called ``property'' risk.
   Because home prices have been falling in some regions, more
consumers are discovering that the outstanding balance on home
equity loans exceeds the equity in their house. The same is true of
auto loans when consumers find after several years that they owe
more money than their car is worth.
   ``Once consumers figure this out, they just hand the keys over
to the bank, whether it's a car, a mobile home ... or a house,'' he
said.
   However, Getman said the souring of consumer loan portfolios,
while a matter of concern, is not nearly as severe as the problem
posed by bad real estate loans.
   ``Unless you have an outright recession and the unemployment
rate shoots up, I don't think consumer loans will become a major
problem,'' he said. On credit cards, ``banks (charge such high
interest rates) that they can easily see delinquency rates double
and still make money.''

<HEAD>US to be Asked for $10 Billion for Third World, Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governments of major industrial countries are
moving toward agreement to send at least $25 billion _ including
about $10 billion from the United States _ to help Third World and
East European countries.
   But agreement in the International Monetary Fund may be harder
to duplicate in Congress, where deficit-conscious lawmakers would
have a hard time diverting money from domestic programs that have
been taking cuts for years.
   ``There'll be trouble getting Congress to approve,'' a
congressional aide who follows the issue closely said Monday.
   ``A lot of congressmen will resist giving all that money to
foreigners while their own favorite programs are being cut at home.
Some of them don't make the distinction that the money is only
being lent out and we get interest back on it.''
   The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled the last
U.S. contribution of $8.5 billion to the fund was approved by a
narrow margin in 1983. But the widespread feeling that Eastern
Europe must be helped will carry much weight with in Congress, he
said.
   The IMF works out agreements with borrowing countries on new
policy programs. They usually include a large dose of austerity for
the people in the borrowing nation.
   When agreements are reached the fund lends heavily to support
them. Its most recent accord, due for final approval this month,
will provide Poland's new non-Communist leadership with $710
million this year.
   Poland, in turn, has moved toward a market economy, ending price
controls and promising to sell or shut down government industries
that are running heavy losses.
   Lower-level officials in Washington are trying to set the exact
figure of the total contribution this week and resolve the question
of Japan's share. If they fail, Canadian Finance Minister Michael
W. Wilson is expected to call together Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady and other leaders to make the decision at the end of this
month.
   The fund now has resources worth about $117 billion but much of
it is in the form of unconvertible Third World currencies that
borrowers do not need.

<HEAD>Senator's Attempted PR Offensive Fizzles Quickly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald Riegle, one of five lawmakers
embroiled in the Lincoln Savings and Loan controversy, won't be
able to use a television interview in his campaign to limit
political damage from the issue.
   Riegle, D-Mich., and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., were both
planning media campaigns to combat the fallout from their
involvement with Charles H. Keating Jr., head of the failed thrift.
   Riegle, D-Mich., planned to use a 30-minute news interview
program, in which he discussed his involvement in the affair, as
part of the media campaign, hoping to broadcast the entire program
on cable television.
   But WXYZ-TV in Detroit, on which the program was broadcast Dec.
10, said Monday it would not give permission to Riegle to use the
program. Karolyn Wallace, a spokeswoman for Riegle, said the
senator's broadcast plans on cable were being canceled because of
the station's response.
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, DeConcini and
the other senators are facing ethics investigations in connection
with their dealings with the failing thrift amid allegations they
intervened with regulators on behalf of the bank's president.
   DeConcini is shelling out $190,000 for newspaper advertisements
and television commercials in his state to tell his version of the
affair.
   ``I have decided to take my case directly to the people of
Arizona,'' DeConcini said last Friday. ``I do this not as a
criticism of the press, but because I do not believe that the facts
have been adequately heard and understood.''
   The other three senators are defending themselves in a variety
of forums but have yet to pay for newspaper or broadcast access to
voters, according to spokesmen.
   The center of Riegle's counterattack was to have been the
30-minute television interview last Dec. 10 on which the senator
responded to questions about his involvement with Keating.
   The program was ``a fair presentation ... a tough and frank
discussion'' of the issue said Ms. Wallace.
   But WXYZ-TV News Director Bob Rowe said Monday his station would
not give permission for a rebroadcast of the program, saying if
permission were given the program ``becomes a political tool and we
have to be unbiased.''
   On the program Riegle was questioned by two reporters and a
moderator. Riegle had planned to pay for the rebroadcast out of
campaign funds, Ms. Wallace said.
   The other three senators involved in the affair are Sens. John
McCain of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Alan Cranston of
California. All except McCain are Democrats.
   At the center of the controversy are two meetings they had on
Keating's behalf with federal regulators. The five received a total
of more than $1.3 million in campaign contributions from Keating,
who headed the Irvine, Calif., thrift, and his associates.
   The government seized control of Lincoln on April 14, 1989, and
the cost to taxpayers is expected to reach a record $2 billion.
   The senators, dubbed the ``Keating Five'' by critics, deny
wrongdoing in their involvement with him and his savings and loan.
They have said their actions were normal constituent services and
were not influenced by Keating's campaign donations.
   Riegle, who later returned the money he received from Keating
and his associates, began granting interviews on the subject in
November to home state reporters, saying he wanted to set the
record straight.
   Glenn has held lengthy news conferences and interviews,
including meetings with newspaper editorial boards in Ohio, but has
no plans to advertise, spokeswoman Rebecca Bell said.
   Cranston has attended public meetings at which questions were
raised about his involvement in the Lincoln case ``and he took them
as they came,'' spokeswoman Victoria Lion said. ``He has been very
accessible to the press.''
   McCain ``has not considered advertising,'' spokesman Scott
Celley said. ``He's found no absence of opportunity to tell his
side of the story.''

<HEAD>Fuel Shipments Blocked By Government During December Cold Snap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of home heating oil would not have
risen as sharply last month if the government had allowed energy
companies to use foreign-flagged vessels to carry fuel to the
Northeast from other U.S. ports, officials said.
   Suppliers were unable to shift some cargoes of home heating oil
from other parts of the country at the height of the December cold
snap because the Customs Service refused to waive a Jones Act ban
on the use of foreign vessels between domestic ports.
   The Customs Service acted on the advice of the Transportation
Department's Maritime Administration, which argued that waivers
were not justified because U.S. vessels were available to transport
the fuel, Walter Oates, a spokesman for the maritime agency, said
Monday.
   ``It's our mandate to promote the U.S.-flagged industry,'' he
said.
   The Energy Department, which intervened in support of the waiver
applications, contended that while some U.S. vessels technically
were available to carry home heating oil, they could not meet the
companies' delivery schedules.
   The shipments would not have eliminated fuel shortages that hit
parts of the Northeast and Midwest during the second half of
December, but the extra supplies might have kept prices from rising
so high, industry and government officials said.
   ``It absolutely would have made a difference,'' said Edwin
Rothschild, energy policy director of Citizen Action, a national
consumer organization.
   Home heating oil prices soared from about 80 cents a gallon in
late November to as much as $1.40 a gallon in some areas by the end
of the year _ far beyond the increases consumers usually see when
the winter heating season arrives.
   ``Having the extra supply that was restricted ... would have
helped,'' said Phil Chisholm, executive vice president of the
Petroleum Marketers Association of America, a trade group of
petroleum product suppliers.
   Chisholm's group was among several industry and consumer groups
scheduled to testify today at a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee hearing on the December heating fuel crisis. Some
state officials have called for a federal investigation of the oil
industry, which they accuse of engineering the price rise.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., who heads the subcommittee, warned
consumers not to expect any immediate price relief from Washington.
Indications Monday were that the price may be dropping this month
as fast as it rose in December.
   ``It's extremely unlikely that there would be a reinstatement of
major price controls that we had in the past decade,'' Sharp said,
adding that Congress lacked the resources to fully explore
allegations of price fixing.
   The oil industry says the main reason for the price increases
and localized shortages of home heating oil and propane was the
unusual spell of severe cold last month. They also acknowledge that
company fuel inventories were significantly lower than usual. The
problem has eased in recent days as the weather warmed.
   In an attempt to relieve a supply squeeze that hit particularly
hard in the Northeast, energy companies in December submitted 11
applications to the federal government for permission to use
foreign-flagged ships to move fuel between U.S. ports, according to
an Energy Department official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Of the 11 applications, six were withdrawn because the
foreign-flagged vessels in question were hired by some other
company or were otherwise made unavailable before the government
acted on the waiver request, the Energy Department official said.
   A waiver was granted to Bay State Gas Co. of Canton, Mass., to
use a Danish-flagged ship to carry 100,000 barrels of propane.
Requests from three other companies to move home heating oil with
foreign vessels were turned down, Oates said.

for drug smuggling, has testified he arranged for the cartel to pay
Noriega $200,000 for each planeload of cocaine protected during
flights through Panama.
   Carlton is one of several convicted drug traffickers likely to
testify against Noriega, who is accused of taking $4.6 million
bribes and other payoffs to give Colombian drug lords a ``safe
haven'' in Panama for cocaine shipments to the United States.
   Like most convicted criminals who become prosecution witnesses,
Carlton's credibility will be sharply tested if he testifies at a
trial of Noriega in Miami.
   But legal experts note testimony from such disreputable
witnesses is commonplace in drug trials and prosecutors have been
able to persuade jurors to accept it, particularly if supported by
other evidence.
   The credibility of unsavory witnesses is ``not an unsurmountable
problem'' especially ``if you have more than one person saying the
same thing or describing things that lead to the same conclusion,''
said a former federal prosecutor who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Other witnesses expected to testify against Noriega are Jose
Blandon, a former Panamanian diplomat and one-time confidant of the
general and convicted smugglers Ramon Milian Rodriguez and Steven
M. Kalish.
   Blandon, who broke with Noriega in 1988, told the Senate and a
federal grand jury about a dispute between Colombian drug lords and
Noriega that was mediated by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Blandon testified the 1984 meeting took place after Panamanian
authorities raided a drug processing plant, arresting 23 Colombians
and Lt. Col. Julian Melo, secretary general of Noriega's staff. The
raid occurred while Noriega was in Paris.
   Blandon said the outraged Colombians claimed they had paid Melo
$5 million to protect the processing plant.
   Soon after Noriega met with Castro, the Colombians and Melo were
freed and equipment and $3 million seized during the raid were
returned to the Colombians, Blandon said.
   Both Castro and Noriega have denounced Blandon's story as a lie.
   But his testimony would dovetail with that of Carlton to show
that Noriega protected the Medellin cartel's operations in Panama.
   Blandon has not been accused by federal prosecutors of
involvement in drug trafficking and his Miami attorney, Atlee
Wampler, dismissed attempts by defense lawyers in public statements
to question Blandon's reliability.
   Blandon attended some key meetings as Noriega's de facto
secretary of state, but ``he had absolutely no involvement in any
shape with drug trafficking,'' Wampler said. ``He was never
involved, that's why defense lawyers want to discredit him.''
   Support for the accounts of Carlton and Blandon could also come
from further testimony by Kalish and Rodriguez.
   Both have previously described the protection Noriega gave the
drug traffickers, including armored-car transport of money and the
use of military airfields.
   Prosecutors could get even more corroboration if any of the five
Noriega co-defendants in custody decides to plead guilty and become
a government witness to get a reduced sentence.
   An attorney for one of those co-defendants, Luis del Cid,
indicated Monday his client was considering testifying against his
former boss.
   ``There was a very preliminary exchange of amenities where the
possibility of some settlement was discussed,'' defense attorney
Samuel Burstyn said of discussions with federal prosecutors in
Miami.
   ``We're desirous of exploring all options, but no offers have
been made on either side and there are no deals,'' he said.
   Del Cid, 46, who surrendered Dec. 25 to U.S. forces, was one of
Noriega's liaisons with drug traffickers and also served as a
courier, according to the indictment.
   He is accused of arranging for the transportation of payments to
Noriega from the drug cartel.
   If he became a government witness, del Cid presumably could
directly corroborate Carlton about one episode described in the
indictment.
   At Noriega's direction, Carlton delivered $200,000 to del Cid at
the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the indictment
alleges.
   The payment was to cover the price that Noriega and Carlton
agreed they would charge the Colombians to protect the next
shipment of cocaine through Panama, the indictment said.
   Shortly after the payment was delivered to del Cid, Carlton is
alleged to have flown 400 kilograms of cocaine to a Panamanian
airstrip from the farm of Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar
Gaviria.

   The Transportation Department says consumer
complaints from air travelers fell slightly in November, although
airline delays increased a bit among the major air carriers.
   The department said Monday that it received 1,125 complaints in
November from air travelers, compared with 1,143 the previous
month. During the month, the 12 largest airlines reported that 78
percent of their flights arrived on time, compared with 79.5
percent in October.
   American Airlines had the best on-time performance in November
with its flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled
arrival time 85.5 percent of the time. Trans World Airlines had the
second best record at 81.8 percent followed by Southwest Airlines
at 81.4 percent.
   USAir had the worst on-time record among the 12 air carriers
with 68.4 percent of its flights arriving on time.
   Mishandled baggage complaints were virtually unchanged from
October to November with 6.99 complaints reported for every 1,000
passengers.

<HEAD>U.S. Assails Soviets for Backing Angolan Offensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is accusing the Soviet
Union of playing a key role in supporting a military offensive by
the Angolan government against U.S.-backed rebels.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called Monday on
Angola's MPLA government and its Soviet allies to stop the
offensive immediately and concentrate on the peace process.
   ``We are very concerned about the dangerous escalation of
offensive military action by the MPLA against UNITA-controlled
territory in southeastern Angola,'' she said. ``That this offensive
action is receiving close support from the substantial number of
Soviet military advisers at the front line is increasing our
concern.''
   The UNITA rebels are believed to receive more than $40 million
annually from the United States.
   Meanwhile, an Angola peace conference scheduled to start
Wednesday has been postponed indefinitely, U.S. officials said. The
presidents of eight African nations had been scheduled to go to the
Angolan capital of Luanda for the conference.
   Ms. Tutwiler tempered her criticism of the Angolans by noting
that President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has indicated interest in
discussing seriously some key issues in the 14-year civil war.
   She urged the MPLA government to take its proposals to Zaire's
President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has led a peace effort.
   According to U.S. officials, after several weeks of logistical
preparations, MPLA forces launched an attack Dec. 23 against
UNITA-controlled areas along the Kuzumbia River.
   There had been high hopes in June for a peace settlement, but a
cease-fire agreement broke down in August and there has been
intermittent fighting since. Efforts to revive the cease-fire and
promote direct negotiations have not prospered.
   U.S. officials were unable to give a reason for the postponement
of the Jan. 10 Angola peace summit.
   A year ago, the State Department was praising Moscow for helping
to promote steps toward peace in southern Africa, including an
agreement that calls for the gradual withdrawal of all Cuban forces
from Angola by 1991.
   But a senior government official, insisting on anonymity, said
Monday that the administration is disappointed about the Soviet
role in Angola over the past year.
   The official said Soviet aid to Angola in 1989 totaled about
$600 million, a slight reduction from the 1988 figure.
   He said the administration thought the Soviets would reduce
their aid further as a means of ``nudging the Angolans toward
negotiations.''
   The Angolans seem to have a more favorable view of an election
process than before but have not accepted the idea of negotiating
with UNITA, the official said.
   One of the most divisive issues has been the Angolan
government's refusal to allow UNITA participation in multi-party
elections.

<HEAD>OAS Calls Incident in Panama a Law Violation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States, which
criticized the U.S. invasion of Panama last month, says the
incursion by U.S. troops into the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence
there was a violation of international law.
   After 3{ hours of debate Monday night, the OAS permanent council
approved a resolution criticizing the action by a 19-0 vote. The
United States and six other countries, mostly from the
English-speaking Caribbean countries, abstained.
   U.S. Ambassador Luigi Einaudi, saying the United States has
apologized for the Dec. 29 incident and taken steps to guard
against a recurrence, said the resolution served no purpose other
than ``anti-U.S.-propaganda.''
   Einaudi said he did not oppose the resolution because the United
States supports the laws that spell out the inviolability of
diplomatic missions.
   The key paragraph of the resolution declares that the ``serious
events that transpired are, as has been recognized, a violation of
the privileges and immunities recognized under international law.''
   The session was far less tendentious than the one shortly before
Christmas when 20 OAS nations criticized the United States for its
invasion of Panama. The U.S. cast the lone opposition vote, but
some countries abstained.
   The troops entered the residence nine days after the invasion as
part of their effort to restore order. According to Einaudi,
efforts by the troops have led to the confiscation of 75,000
weapons.
   But Nicaraguan delegate Victoria Castillo dismissed Einaudi's
explanations and said the incursion was a ``deliberate
provocation.''
   She called on the United States to provide ``just and
immediate'' reparations for the damage done to the residence. This,
she said, ``would make it possible to believe that the United
States has indeed recognized its error and is disposed not to
commit such an error again.''
   The incident has generated uneasiness among some U.S. career
diplomats, who believe that what happened in Panama could serve as
a precedent for the penetration of an American Embassy somewhere by
radical forces.
   ``It puts in jeopardy American diplomatic missions all over the
world,'' said Perry Shankle, a former president of the American
Foreign Service Association.
   The day after the incident, President Bush called it a ``screw
up'' but criticized the Nicaraguan ambassador for having
``automatic weapons up to his eyeballs'' in the house. There were
12 AK-47 rifles, among other weapons, in the residence.
   The Nicaraguan ambassador to Panama, Antenor Ferrey, flew here
for the meeting and called for strong action against the United
States.
   If no such action is taken, he said, diplomats ``will be thought
of as cannon fodder by those who can only understand the use of
force.''
   Einaudi said, however, that the U.S. troops made efforts to
confirm independently the address of the Nicaraguan ambassador and
had concluded he lived elsewhere after a check of the diplomatic
lists.
   Once the troops realized their mistake, he said, they withdrew
after returning all weapons. He said there were no arrests and he
denied that any damage was done to the residence.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega retaliated by expelling 20
U.S. diplomats from Managua.

   Weather remained a threat today as
NASA once again fueled space shuttle Columbia for a satellite
rescue mission.
   The winged spaceship, grounded Monday by low clouds, was
scheduled to lift off with its five astronauts during a 58-minute
launch opportunity that was starting at 7:35 a.m.
   The period is determined by the location of the science
laboratory that the space travelers hope to retrieve before it
falls back to Earth, perhaps in March.
   Meterologists said there was a 70 percent chance the weather
would be favorable at launch time, but a cold front moving through
central and south Florida threatened to shroud the launch area in
clouds.
   After assessing the weather late Monday, shuttle managers
directed technicians to once more pump 524,000 gallons of liquid
hydrogen and oxygen into Columbia's huge external fuel tank.
   Launch director Bob Sieck conducted a stop-and-go countdown and
waited until the last possible minute before scrubbing the launch
Monday.
   ``It looks like we will have to call it a day,'' Sieck told the
astronauts when it became apparent the skies would not be clear
enough.
   It had been fairly clear over the launch pad. But a 30-mile-wide
bank of clouds approaching from the west at 6,000 feet would have
made an emergency landing difficult for commander Dan Brandenstein,
who would have to land the spaceship on a concrete runway near the
pad.
   The flight is the first of a record 10 shuttle missions the
space agency has scheduled in 1990. Planned for 10 days, it is the
second longest flight yet in the program.
   The astronauts' first task will be to deploy a Navy
communications satellite during the second day.
   From the beginning of the trip, Brandenstein and pilot Jim
Wetherbee were to execute a series of intricate maneuvers to
gradually track down over several days a satellite which has
orbited Earth for nearly six years.
   The target is Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), which is
the size of a small school bus and is packed with 57 experiments
containing a wealth of scientific and technological information
from its long exposure to space.
   Once the satellite is caught, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar
will reach out with the shuttle's remote 50-foot arm to snare the
21,400-pound package, which is 30 feet long and 14 feet in diameter.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' Brandenstein
said in a recent interview. ``But NASA has plenty experience doing
this type of rendezvous, and Jim and I have practiced it to
perfection in the simulator.''
   The satellite is 202 miles up but atmospheric drag has been
pulling it to Earth at the rate of about half a mile a day. The
rate will increase as it gets closer.
   If the satellite can't be retrieved, trackers estimate it will
fall into the atmosphere and burn up about March 9, its experiments
lost forever.
   Once the satellite is secure in the shuttle cargo bay,
Brandenstein, Wetherbee, Dunbar and mission specialists Marsha
Ivins and David Low will concentrate on experiments for the rest of
the flight. The emphasis will be on materials processing and tests
of how the human body adapts to weightlessness.
   The 10-day mission's schedule is to be 10 hours shorter than
ninth shuttle flight, in November 1983, and is a stepping stone for
even longer ones. Columbia is being modified to stay aloft 16 days,
starting with a 1993 flight.
   Scientists are eager to examine LDEF primarily to learn how
various materials and systems have withstood the long stay in
orbit. The information will help in designing a permanent manned
space station and other long-term spacecraft such as those planned
for the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system.

<HEAD>Jury Selection in Ike Turner Trial Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection is under way in the
trial of rhythm and blues musician Ike Turner on felony charges of
drug and weapons violations stemming from a traffic stop last May.
   Turner, 57, is charged with possession for sale of ``rock'' or
crystallized cocaine, transporting cocaine and illegally carrying a
concealable weapon.
   Other charges include driving under the influence of a
controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, both
misdemeanors.
   Selection of jurors began Monday in Superior Court.
   Turner was arrested May 22 by sheriff's deputies who reported he
failed to stop his car at a stop sign. Officers said they found a
.38-caliber revolver and cocaine inside the car.
   Turner, ex-husband of singer Tina Turner, has been arrested
previously on cocaine-related charges.
   In October 1986, Turner admitted he had used cocaine every day
for at least 15 years but said he was following a rehabilitation
program.
   In August 1987, he was arrested after officers said they
discovered 56 grams of rock cocaine in a container inside his car.
   Turner played rhythm and blues in the 1950s, performing with the
Ikettes. He later formed the Ike and Tina Turner Revue with his
wife. They split up in 1976 after nearly 16 years of marriage.

   The diner where television viewers saw
``the quicker picker-upper'' sop up spills will be picked up and
moved to Michigan.
   Ralph Corrado, 57, sold Rosie's Diner to Jerry Berta, a ceramic
sculptor from Michigan who stopped inside by chance in December on
his way to a New York City art show.
   Corrado said the diner will close for good Sunday and he will
retire.
   The vintage dining car restaurant achieved a modicum of fame
between 1970 and 1975, when Procter &amp; Gamble featured it in a
series of four commercials for its Bounty paper towels.
   In the ads, actress Nancy Walker portrayed the waitress Rosie,
who wields the paper towels against the counter spills of clumsy
truck drivers.
   Corrado renamed the diner for Rosie.
   Until three years ago, the diner was open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, but Corrado said it got to be too much.
   Berta refused to say how much he paid for the diner, which he
calls a classic of the dining car genre, built in 1945 by the
Paramount Dining Car Co.
   ``I bought it because I got tired of driving out East to eat in
diners, and this is my favorite diner in the country,'' said the
Rockford, Mich., artist, who works out of a studio and gallery that
was formerly a diner.
   The diner will be divided in two and placed on trucks for the
trip at an as yet undetermined time.
   Berta said he plans to hire someone with restaurant experience
to manage the diner in Michigan.

   Tadeusz Brzezinski, the Polish
government-in-exile's consul-general in Montreal during World War
II and the father of former U.S. national security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski, has died of pneumonia at age 94. Brzezinski, who died
Sunday at a nursing home, was consul-general from 1938 until the
Communist takeover of his homeland at the end of World War II.
   He became a prominent member of the Montreal Polish community,
serving as president of the Polish-Canadian Congress from 1952 to
1962. In 1975, he helped create the World Polish Congress.
   Until his retirement in 1968, Brzezinski worked for the Quebec
Cultural Affairs Department, establishing cultural centers across
the province.
   Brzezinski was born in 1896, in Zloczow, then part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and now in the Soviet Union.
   As a volunteer in the Polish independence movement from 1918 to
1920, Brzezinski saw action in the battle of Lvov and against
Soviet forces in the final Warsaw campaign of 1920.
   He then served as a Polish diplomat for the nascent Polish
Republic in Germany, France, the Soviet Ukraine and Canada.
   While in Leipzig, Germany, before World War II, Brzezinski
became involved in efforts to rescue European Jews from Nazi
concentration camps.
   In 1978, his efforts on behalf of the Jewish people were
recognized by Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin.
   Brzezinski, husband of the late Leonia Roman, is survived by two
sons _ Zbigniew, formerly national security adviser under President
Jimmy Carter, and Lech, an engineer in Montreal. He is also
survived by seven grandchildren.
   A memorial Mass was planned Thursday at St. Wojciech Mission
Church in Montreal. Funeral arrangements were not immediately
announced.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
Tuesday, while the dollar rose against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.97 yen, up 0.45 yen from Monday's close
of 144.52 yen. It opened lower at 144.25 yen and ranged between
144.25 yen and 145.25 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 343.50 points, or 0.90
percent, ending at 37,951.46, the lowest since Dec. 12, when the
index recorded 37,803.53.
   Dealers said the Nikkei's plunge Tuesday was prompted by many
factors, such as political uncertainties in the Soviet Union, a
decline in bond prices and a stock plunge in Argentina.
   ``Market players were discouraged by the news reports about the
Soviet Union and Argentina and stepped off to the sidelines soon
after the morning session started,'' said Masayoshi Yano, a dealer
with Nikko Securities Co.
   The Soviet government daily Izvestia reported Monday that
violence has been developing along the Soviet-Iranian border, with
protesters from Soviet Azerbaijan destroying border posts.
   In another part of Azerbaijan, the official Soviet news agency
Tass said acts of sabotage, hostage-taking, and sniper fire were
continuing in the disputed district of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Argentina, the country's leading stocks plunged by 53 percent
Monday when the market reopened for the first time in more than a
week.
   The fall was due in part to the shortage of australs in
circulation, analysts said. On Jan. 1, the government unilaterally
converted several billion dollars worth of short-term certificates
of deposit to 10-year bonds.
   Also, the yen's weakness on the foreign exchange market Monday
as well as falling bond prices in the futures market discouraged
Japanese investors, Nikko Securities' Yano said. The futures bond
price made a sharp 0.99-yen one-day drop to 101 yen.
   ``Investors remained cautious trying to watch bond price
movements and the international situation,'' he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened during morning
trading here following a cut in the prime rate by major U.S. banks
overnight, traders said.
   As domestic and international political uncertainties developed,
market players discarded the yen and bought the dollar as a safer
investment tool, said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``Until the election here, the yen won't be very attractive to
many investors,'' he said. A major parliamentary election is
expected later in February, but the government has not finalized
the schedule.
   ``The prime rate cut in the United States didn't make the dollar
much weaker, and today everybody's selling the yen here,'' he said.
   But Kanai said the Bank of Japan intermittently conducted
dollar-selling to support the yen, which should keep the dollar
within the 145-146 yen range.
   The central bank does not comment on its monetary actions.
   The dollar's overnight slip followed its similar downswing in
the New York market Monday after many banks cut their prime lending
rate by a half-percentage point to 10 percent.
   The prime-rate cut reflects more liberal credit policies by the
Federal Reserve Bank and will lower borrowing costs for businesses
and consumers.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin wants Vermont to
become the first state to ban all disposable diapers, but her plan
is being trashed by some including day-care operators who want no
part of a mountain of cloth.
   ``The time has come to be responsible and to find the way to say
yes _ yes to required statewide recycling, to bans on certain
polluting products, to changes in lifestyle,'' Kunin said in her
state of the state speech last week.
   Only Nebraska has banned disposable diapers, but it allows the
sale of diapers that are biodegradable, even though such products
aren't believed to break down in the depths of oxygen-starved dumps.
   Kunin, whose proposal would ban disposable diapers by 1993,
noted that while the usable life of a disposable diaper may be a
few hours, they won't decompose in dumps for hundreds of years _ or
several generations of babies later.
   Environmental groups have quickly supported the plan by Kunin,
who last year made the state the first to ban the sale of vehicles
that use ozone-depleting chemicals in their air conditioning. That
ban starts with 1993 models.
   ``They are a large part of the waste stream,'' said Ned Farquhar
of the Vermont Natural Resources Council. ``The throw-away society
is wasting energy and materials, not just with diapers, but with a
lot of similar products. We need to ban things to keep people from
using them.''
   The piles of discarded diapers make up about 2 percent of the
nation's waste, and about 85 percent of all parents use disposable
diapers exclusively, according to industry estimates.
   Vermont officials estimate that 43.5 million disposable diapers
end up in the state's dumps every year.
   Opponents of a ban argue that the governor's plan won't have
much impact in solving the state's mounting garbage disposal
problem. Representatives of the health and day-care industries also
say they are not ready to handle such a ban.
   ``There has been a tendency to pass into law programs on the
basis of trendy catchwords, rather than science or careful
consideration of all the different issues,'' said William Gilbert,
a lobbyist representing the American Paper Institute.
   Gilbert said that mandating cloth diapers would add two to three
more loads of hot-water washings weekly for families with babies,
raising its own questions about environmental damage.
   Day-care centers, especially in rural parts of the state where
there are no cloth diaper services, fear how they would be affected.
   ``If a ban went into effect today, it would create real havoc,''
said Lea Hatch, a day-care regulator for the state. But she added
that centers in areas with access to diaper services already are
beginning to offer that option to parents in lieu of disposables.
   Bethany Carleton, head of the Vermont Health Care Association,
also said disposable diapers help prevent skin problems better than
cloth ones. ``There are definitely reasons people don't want to go
back to cloth,'' she said.
   Vermonters also are debating the wisdom of a ban in general.
   Windsor County Sen. John Carroll, a Republican who has joined
the Democratic governor in the proposal, said he could understand
the reluctance to a mandate.
   But he added, ``I think this needs to be talked about a lot more
carefully than it has been. I think this is the year to do it. Now
is time to take advantage of public awareness of the crisis in
solid waste.''
   David Wilson, a former state secretary of administration, said
bans don't serve the environmental movement well.
   ``They engender public resentment of what are otherwise sound
environmental policies,'' Wilson said. ``The public has a strong
reaction to mandates. When you do try to mandate, you may be
throwing the baby out with the bathwater.''

   One Rhode Island dump can't get enough
of trash, so it's may give a special deal for garbage.
   The state's price of $59 a ton to dump at the Central Landfill
in Johnston prompted companies to haul trash out of state.
   Rhode Island officials, facing an $8 million shortfall in
projected revenues of $22 million from commercial dumping, are
considering a price reduction, said Michael Carroll, associate
director of finance for the state Solid Waste Management Corp.
   But the issue isn't as simple as making the price competitive.
   The quasi-public corporation still needs enough money to carry
out its legislative mandate of developing a complete waste disposal
system, from incinerators to recycling.
   When state officials in August raised the ``tipping'' fee at
Central Landfill to $59 a ton from $10, they thought it would be
competitive with landfills in neighboring states. State officials
had surveyed the dump market within 100 miles of Rhode Island.
   What went wrong?
   ``We didn't get current information,'' Carroll said. With some
new landfills and incinerators opening, ``Massachusetts has a glut
and they were able to take in some of the Rhode Island trash.''
   At the same time, cities and towns by law must pay only $13 per
ton, increasing 7.5 percent a year.
   Trash haulers say they started bypassing the dump for reasons
other than just price. Some blame the state's mandatory recycling
rules that took effect this year. The recycling laws require that
no more than 20 percent of a load brought to the landfill be
recyclable.
   Using out-of-state incinerators ``is about break-even with
dumping it at the Central Landfill,'' said David Wilson, vice
president of Truk-Away of Rhode Island Inc. But if it means
avoiding the $500 fine for a load with too much recyclable
material, it's worth it, he said.
   ``As long as 20 percent by weight is the criteria now for
violating the law, lowering the rates wouldn't make any
difference,'' he said. ``When the rate went up, it made everybody
look into recycling faster.''
   That raises the important question: If the state's stressing
recycling to lengthen the life of a dump, how does it reach the
delicate balance of enough revenue to run the recycling program
while not attracting too much trash so it runs out of room?
   ``We haven't gotten that far,'' Carroll said.

   Art Buchwald's victory over Paramount
Pictures about rights to ``Coming to America'' was hailed as a
triumph for writers, but the studio feared the court decision could
mean a rash of bogus lawsuits.
   ``I am very, very happy,'' Buchwald said in a telephone
interview after a judge ruled Monday that Paramount must pay him
for the script idea he claimed was the basis for the hit Eddie
Murphy movie ``Coming to America.''
   ``This thing is not only an important thing for me,'' Buchwald
said. ``I think it's really important for writers.''
   Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider ruled that ``Coming to
America'' was ``based upon a material element of, or was inspired
by'' a synopsis Buchwald wrote entitled ``King for a Day.''
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that for two years Paramount
considered `King for a Day' to be a project that was being
developed for Eddie Murphy,'' the judge ruled. Monetary damages in
the $5 million lawsuit were not decided, but the judge disallowed
any punitive award.
   Paramount promised an appeal, while writers predicted their
battles would be a bit easier against Hollywood studios.
   ``I am delighted that the little man kicked the big guy,'' said
Billy Wilder, a Buchwald ally and the director and co-writer of
Paramount's 1950 classic ``Sunset Boulevard.''
   ``It's a very important decision for all writers,'' said David
Rintels, an award-winning screenwriter (``Day One,'' ``Sakharov'')
who served as an expert witness on Buchwald's behalf. ``It upholds
the sanctity of contracts and it affirms that a writer's original
ideas have value.''
   Buchwald's story, like 1988's ``Coming to America,'' was about a
member of African royalty who comes to the United States, lives in
a ghetto, works at a fast-food restaurant and finds a bride to take
home to his native land.
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist filed the lawsuit last
year, alleging the studio breached a 1983 contract to purchase his
script idea.
   Buchwald's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said that his client and
Buchwald's writing partner, producer Alain Bernheim, stood to
receive between $5 million and $10 million.
   The judge's decision allows an inspection of Paramount's
financial records on the movie, O'Donnell said. Paramount claims
the film, which has gross profits of more than $300 million, has no
net profits.
   ``If you believe that,'' Buchwald quipped, ``then there's a
wonderful S&amp;L I'd like to sell you.''
   Paramount, meanwhile, began preparing for another round in court.
   ``We don't agree with the judge's decision on the contract
claim. However, we are pleased he threw out the claim for punitive
damages,'' it said in a statement. ``We are confident that the
appellate court will find that `Coming to America' was created
without any contribution from Art Buchwald.''
   Robert Draper, an attorney for Paramount, said Buchwald's script
idea and Murphy's movie were entirely different: ``It's like
`Godzilla' and `Cinderella.'''
   The only similarity, he said, was that the main characters in
each version were black.
   Draper said that the judge's interpretation of the ``based
upon'' concept _ a crucial point in the ruling _ was too broad.
   ``Under the interpretation of `based upon' that was adopted,
just about anything could be found to be based upon anything
else,'' Draper said.
   Paramount's lawyers had said during the court proceedings that a
ruling in favor of Buchwald could trigger an onslaught of
groundless lawsuits.
   Neither Murphy nor his manager, Bob Wachs, responded to
telephone messages for comment.
   A spokeswoman for Arsenio Hall, who developed the movie with
Murphy and co-starred in it, also did not respond to a telephone
request for comment.
   Buchwald said his dispute was solely a breach-of-contract claim
against Paramount and not an allegation of plagiarism against
Murphy.
   Buchwald also said the ordeal cured him of one ambition: ``I
have decided not to write any movies for the next 10 years.''

   The U.S. coastal areas from three miles to 12
miles off shore are in a legal never-never land that Congress needs
to clarify, Gov. John Waihee says.
   He recommended Monday that the adjacent state be given
jurisdiction of the expanded coastal area, along with the revenues
that might be generated there.
   Waihee appeared before the U.S. House Committee on Merchant
Marine and Fisheries at the state Capitol during a hearing on U.S.
oceans and coastal management issues in the Pacific.
   The committee is on an eight-day trip to Hawaii to examine
fishing rights, ocean mining and the territorial seas. The
itinerary is heavy on free time and evening receptions, however.
But the representatives bristle at suggestions that the excursion
is a political junket.
   Three panel members made the trip from Washington, D.C., joining
two Hawaii congressmen. The hearing was to resume today.
   Waihee said Monday that federal laws have established a
reasonably effective state-federal management process for the
coastal zone out to three miles.
   Those rules should be extended to the 12-mile limit, if the
adjacent state, territory or commonwealth agrees, he said. The
governor recommended that states draw up plans to manage the new
zone.
   As for the nearly $1 billion in annual federal revenues from
offshore oil and gas leases in the three- to 12- mile zone, Waihee
suggested that revenues from new production over the next 10 years
be divided 50-50 between federal and the adjacent state.
   After the period, he said, the money should go the state upon
completion of a management program.
   Hawaii has no offshore oil and gas leases, but it does have
mineral-rich manganese crusts on seamounts near the islands.

<HEAD>Wide Implications Seen From Cordless-Phone Eavesdropping Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to ban
eavesdropping of conversations on cordless telephones has
implications for all phone users, a civil-liberties lawyer says.
   The court, without comment, on Monday let stand a ruling that
Scott County law enforcement agents acted lawfully when they
monitored cordless-phone conversations by the Scott Tyler family of
Dixon without a warrant.
   One of every four American homes has a cordless phone, according
to industry estimates, but the ruling could affect people using
standard cord telephones who, knowingly or not, talk with someone
using a cordless phone, said Randall Wilson of the Iowa Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``I'm sure the justices had some very good reasons for refusing
to hear the case,'' said Wilson, who helped represent Tyler. ``But
for now it means that every American will have to live in fear that
some of his or her phone calls will not be private.
   ``I think the message for Americans will continue to be that if
you purchase modern conveniences, such as cordless phones or baby
monitors or other radio devices, it means purchasing them at the
expense of your constitutional rights.''
   Tyler said he will refile the case before the high court in its
next session, beginning Oct. 1. Wilson, however, was doubtful the
court would take another look at the case.
   Tyler said he received a cordless phone as a Father's Day gift
in 1983 from his children. Whenever the phone was in use, Rich and
Sandra Berodt, who lived a few blocks away, discovered their
cordless phone would making ringing and dialing noises.
   Based on at least one phone conversation they listened to, the
Berodts suspected Tyler was involved in illegal drug dealing. They
contacted the county sheriff's department.
   Authorities encouraged the Berodts to continue the eavesdropping
and supplied them with recording equipment so conversations on the
Tylers' phone could be taped.
   The suspicion of drug-dealing proved unfounded, but over several
months authorities relied on the tapes to charge Tyler with
criminal theft and conspiracy. The tapes, however, were barred as
evidence at his trial.
   Tyler was convicted in late 1984 on charges stemming from his
bilking two food companies out of $35,000. He was sentenced to 10
years in prison but released after 123 days.
   Tyler and his family later sued the Berodts, Scott County,
Sheriff Forest Ashcraft and a sheriff's investigator, contending
the warrantless phone monitoring violated the family's Fourth
Amendment privacy rights.
   U.S. District Judge Harold D. Vietor in Davenport dismissed the
lawsuit, and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
ruling, which the Supreme Court let stand.
   Vietor had noted that the technology of cordless phones makes
conversations on them more susceptible to interception. ``Because
there was no justifiable expectation of privacy, the interceptions
did not violate the Fourth Amendment,'' he ruled.
   The amendment generally bars searches and seizures without
warrants. Police have been barred since a landmark 1967 high court
ruling from secretly listening to conversations over traditional
phones without court warrants.
   Tyler, who has waged a crusade over the eavesdropping issue,
said he won't put his campaign on hold.
   ``I and millions of Americans still believe this is just simply
wrong. ...
   ``As it now stands, information gained from a cordless phone
could be used diabolically by police agencies, divorce lawyers,
banking institutions, et cetera,'' Tyler said in a telephone
interview _ on a standard cord phone.

<HEAD>Report: Noriega to be Moved Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials plan to move Manuel Noriega out
of state for security reasons, according to a published report
today, but his lawyers said they know nothing about such a move.
   Quoting an anonymous source involved in the shift, The New York
Times reported that the deposed Panamanian leader probably would be
taken to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta.
   He was being held early today in a holding cell in the U.S.
courthouse here, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told
The Associated Press.
   U.S. marshals and Noriega's attorneys refuse to disclose his
whereabouts.
   ``Up until now they (U.S. marshals) have not intimated in any
way that they're going to remove him'' from Miami, defense attorney
Steven Kollin said late Monday.
   ``However they have told us, frankly, that they may have to move
him from the place where he is being held now to a more suitable
place for their security purposes.
   ``If this is not in the southern district of Florida or not
suitable so that we can have access for meetings with our client,
we will file the appropriate motions,'' he told the AP.
   Another Noriega attorney, Frank Rubino, also said he had not
been informed of an imminent move. Both attorneys said they have
met daily with their client.
   Federal officials believe the Metropolitan Correctional Center,
a federal prison south of Miami, does not offer adequate security
to hold Noriega, the Times said.
   Officials considered federal prisons in Leavenworth, Kan., and
Marion, Ill., but Atlanta's was first choice because it is closest
to Miami, the newspaper reported.
   Rubino and Kollin don't expect to make their first motions in
the drug-trafficking case for 30 days. But when they do, they
likely will challenge the court's jurisdiction, the way Noriega was
brought to this country after U.S. invasion of Panama and requests
for government documents.
   An attorney for a pilot accused of flying drug money for
Noriega, meanwhile, asked for disclosure of secret information
obtained from U.S. electronic surveillance in Panama.
   The motion by Michael O'Kane, representing Panamanian pilot
Daniel Miranda, asked the court to compel release of classified
information from a telecommunications monitoring operation at the
U.S. Southern Command.
   The indictment charges that Miranda flew $800,000 in drug money
from Florida to Panama in 1983.
   Lawyers for other co-defendants said they have begun talks with
prosecutors but no deals have been struck.
   ``We're desirous of exploring all options, but no offers have
been made on either side and there are no deals,'' said Samuel
Burstyn, attorney for Luis del Cid, a former close aide to Noriega.

   The remains of Ferdinand Marcos'
mother will be entombed in a refrigerated mausoleum this month _
nearly two years after her death, the family mortician said today.
   Before the Sept. 28 death in Hawaii of the ousted and exiled
president, the Marcos family had insisted it would not bury his
mother, Josefa Edralin Marcos, unless he was permitted to return
home for the funeral.
   President Corazon Aquino, who came to power in the popular
uprising that ousted Marcos in February 1986, cited security
reasons for refusing to allow Marcos to return and later banning
his burial in the Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos, who died May 4, 1988, will be kept in the
encasement indefinitely until both mother and son are allowed to be
buried together in the Philippines, said the mortician, Francisco
Malabed.
   Marcos, who died at age 72, was entombed in Hawaii on Oct. 15.
   Malabed said the family asked him to prepare for the funeral and
entombment Jan. 21 in Ilocos Norte province, 220 miles north of the
capital. Malabed said the decision was made by Marcos' brother
Pacifico and sister Fortuna.
   Mrs. Marcos will be placed in a mausoleum similar to that of her
son's in Honolulu, Malabed said. He said the funeral will take
place in the back of the Marcos home in Batac town, where the
former president grew up.
   The funeral plans could not be immediately confirmed with the
Marcos family.

<TEXT>
   More than half of an unprecedented number of dead
manatees found in Florida waterways during the past nine days may
be victims of the Christmas cold snap, state officials said.
   The carcasses of 41 of the endangered marine mammals have been
discovered in the new year, the state's Department of Natural
Resources reported Monday.
   There were only 15 manatees found dead last year in all of
January, said Dr. Bruce Ackerman, marine mammal researcher at the
department's Florida Research Institute.
   ``It's the worst winter die-off we've had since we've been
counting,'' he said. ``They are literally coming in so fast we
can't keep our records up.''
   Ackerman's department has been documenting manatee deaths since
1974.
   Most of the carcasses have been found in the waters off Brevard
County. Violet Stewart, an institute spokeswoman, said 27 of the
gentle sea cows have been found there.
   ``It appears that the water over there got particularly cold,''
she said. ``We had some reports of water temperatures down into the
40s.''
   She said marine biologists estimate that 25 to 30 of the deaths
are cold-related, although precise causes will take time to
determine.
   ``They are finding that manatees died with this cold snap and
they sank,'' Ms. Stewart said. ``As they decay they rise to the
surface, so they are just now being recovered.''
   Ackerman said that since manatees are tropical, they have no
layer of blubber like seals and whales.
   ``They lose their ability to digest food and gradually become
more run-down,'' he said. ``When they get run-down, they lose the
ability to swim to a warmer place.''
   Last year, there were a record 165 manatee deaths. Biologists
estimate that Florida has only 1,200 of the endangered creatures
left.

   Mayor Maureen O'Connor concluded her State of

   ``Only a mayor leaving the office to another can outline,
without a hidden agenda, the honest path the city must follow to

   A two-term limit for elected officials is among those proposals,
which the Democrat said she would like to see be put before voters

   O'Connor, 42, the city's first woman mayor, won a 1986 special

<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco was assailed by
the opposition and reported to have even angered his own foreign
minister by backing a Bush administration plan to station U.S.
warships off the coast in an attempt to snare drug traffickers.
   News reports Monday said Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes
planned to resign over the issue, but Colombia's ambassador in
Washington, Victor Mosquera Chaux, later said Londono told him he
was not quitting.
   Protests over the planned U.S. operation were not unexpected
because Barco's 5-month-old war with Colombia's powerful cocaine
barons, seen as courageous elsewhere, has received relatively
little support at home.
   The issue is also sensitive after the U.S. invasion of Panama
last month, which drew criticism from Colombians and other Latin
Americans, who are sensitive to Washington's use of military force
in the region as an instrument of policy.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President
Bush on a trip to Orlando, Fla., said two ships were on maneuvers
in the Atlantic but that future deployment near Colombia would
depend on talks with the Barco government.
   The carrier John F. Kennedy and guided missile cruiser Virginia
left Thursday from Norfolk, Va.
   Bush has looked at sending U.S. warships off Colombia's
Caribbean coast to help monitor and interdict narcotics
traffickers, Pentagon sources have said.
   A diplomat with the U.S. Embassy said Monday that Barco had not
sent a protest note or objected in any other way, officially or
unofficially, to an increase of Caribbean patrols. The official
asked to remain anonymous so he would not become a target of the
cocaine gangs.
   Officials of both countries said Monday that such an operation
would not constitute a blockade.
   The Colombian Embassy in Washington issued a statement denying
the United States sought to set up a blockade in Colombia's coastal
waters and saying the Bush administration gave assurances it will
not interfere with Colombian-flagged ships, even on the high seas,
without the permission of Colombia's Defense Ministry.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``A
blockade would mean shutting down everything, and that, obviously,
is not our intention.''
   A U.S. Embassy statement last week said the Navy patrols were
merely an exercise in increased vigilance, not a new policy, and
would take place in international waters.
   Adding to the confusion about Colombia's official position was a
report Sunday by the Bogota daily El Tiempo that Barco's office
issued a statement saying Colombia would not contribute warships to
the U.S. effort.
   Julio Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for Barco, said the El Tiempo
story was not based on any Barco statement because none had been
issued.
   La Prensa, a Bogota daily with access to presidential advisers,
said Monday that the debate within the Colombian government
appearerd to stem from a dispute between president and foreign
minister.
   Radio Caracol, quoting an unidentified, high-ranking source in
the government, said Londono was preparing his resignation Monday
afternoon. Mosquera Chaux later denied the report, speaking in an
interview with Radio Caracol from Washington.
   Monday was a holiday in Colombia and government offices were not
open for official comment.
   There was also no immediate comment on what bearing possible
U.S. interdiction efforts could have on a regional drug summit is
scheduled for Feb. 15 in Cartagena, Colombia, that is to be
attended by Bush.
   Protests to the possible stationing of U.S. warships in the
Caribbean came from the opposition Conservative Party and the
leftist Patriotic Union Party. Neither has been supportive of
Barco's attempt to crush drug traffickers.
   Colombia's congress should be called into emergency session ``to
emphatically reject the air and sea maneuvers implemented by the
United States,'' the president of the Conservative Party's central
committee, Rodrigo Barraza, said in a broadcast interview.
   The interview was broadcast by the radio network Caracol.
   The Patriotic Union's presidential candidate for elections next
May, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa, said in a Caracol interview that the
U.S. action in the Caribbean shows that Colombia apparently is just
a step away from a U.S. invasion.

<HEAD>Jurors in Reputed Mob Boss Trial to be Sequestered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors in the assault and conspiracy trial of
reputed mob boss John Gotti will be sequestered for the duration of
the case.
   State Judge Edward McLauglin told the first pool of 300
prospective jurors brought Monday into his courtroom he made the
decision because he was responsible for the jurors' ``well-being
and comfort.''
   ``You are going to be guests of the state for the entire
trial,'' he said.
   He said the trial will last about three weeks and will be in
session Monday through Saturday. He said the jury will be locked
away in hotels for the rest of each day and on days the trial is
not held.
   McLaughlin said the defense would be given the jurors' names but
not the addresses of their homes or places of business.
   Assistant District Attorney Jeffrey Schlanger had requested that
the jurors' names be kept confidential, noting it took three trials
to reach a verdict in 1988 in a federal racketeering and narcotics
case involving Gotti's brother, Gene, because jurors were accosted
and intimidated.
   About three-fourths of the initial pool were excused when they
said they were unable to sit on a sequestered jury for three weeks.
The remaining 77 were given questionnaires about their personal
histories and opinions.
   Three more groups of 300 will be brought in as prospective
jurors.
   The judge said he planned to hold a hearing today on the
admissibility of tape recordings of a conversation at Rikers Island
between reputed gang members about the May 1986 shooting of John F.

<HEAD>Research Shows Seven Shuffles Cut Fair Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the deck isn't shuffled seven times, you may
be getting a raw deal.
   Two mathematicians _ one of whom also is a magician _ have
discovered that it takes exactly seven ordinary shuffles to mix a
deck of cards thoroughly.
   Fewer shuffles are not enough and more do not significantly
improve the mix, according to a story today in The New York Times.
   The research was conducted by magician-mathematician Persi
Diaconis, who is also a statistician at Harvard University, and his
colleague, Dave Bayer, who is a mathematician and computer
scientist at Columbia University.
   The two made the discovery after studying results from elaborate
computer calculations and careful observations of card games.
   It confirms the intuition of many gamblers, bridge enthusiasts
and casual players that most shuffling is inadequate.
   Most people shuffle just three or four times, which Diaconis
says produces an order that ``is far from random.''
   Casino gamblers and even bridge players often take advantage of
the non-randomness of insufficiently shuffled cards, Diaconis said.
By knowing what the deck looked like at the end of the last hand,
they can predict the distribution of the next hand.
   Diaconis said that the non-randomness of insufficiently shuffled
cards is so common that when computers were first introduced to mix
cards at bridge tournaments nearly 20 years ago, players were
puzzled and outraged by the random hands the computers dealt.
   By saying that the deck is perfectly mixed after seven shuffles,
the researchers mean that every arrangement of the 52 cards is
equally likely or that any card is as likely to be in one place as
in another.
   The cards get more randomly mixed after seven shuffles, but
seven times is a transition point, the first time randomness is
close. Additional shuffles don't appreciably change things.
   In Las Vegas casinos, cards are shuffled from four to seven
times, at the discretion of casino owners, said Richard Ingram, a
Law Vegas enforcement agent for the state gambling control board.
   Diaconis said his research showed that when dealers shuffle
several decks of cards at once, they need to shuffle more. Two
decks should be shuffled nine times, he said, and six decks 12
times.
   At Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J., blackjack dealers shuffle
eight decks twice at the beginning of each game, said Howard
Dreitzer, senior vice president of casino operations.
   ``We've tested these shuffles and feel that they are random,''
he said, adding that ``no one has ever complained.''

<HEAD>Stocks Fall Below 38,000 Mark, Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged below
the 38,000-point mark today amid uncertainties over domestic
politics and overseas developments, and the dollar gained against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 343.50
points, or 0.90 percent, closing at 37,951.46, the lowest since
Dec. 12, when the index closed at 37,803.53.
   The index lost more than 500 points by midafternoon but
rebounded somewhat as institutional investors picked up issues that
had fallen earlier, said Takahiro Makita, a dealer with Yamaichi
Securities Co.
   Makita said investors were discouraged by rumors about a
politician's possible arrest in an alleged insider trading case,
falling bond prices, the weakening yen, news about bombings in
restive Soviet Azerbaijan, and the 53 percent plunge in Argentina's
stock market Monday, when it reopened for the first time in more
than a week.
   A drop in future bond prices ignited fears of higher interest
rates, which discourage stock investment.
   ``Such discouraging elements sent Japanese market players off to
the sidelines and made trading inactive,'' Makita said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares,
unchanged from the previous day.
   ``To begin with, the market has been unstable ahead of the
election. Such nervous trading could occur repeatedly until then,''
Makita added.
   Elections for the lower house of Parliament are expected in
mid-February, although the government has made no official
announcement.
   With the insider trading rumor and Soviet developments also
affecting the yen, the dollar closed at 144.97 yen, up 0.45 yen
from Monday's 144.52-yen finish, despite central bank intervention
to support the Japanese currency. The dollar opened at 144.25 yen,
its low for the day, and ranged as high as 145.25 yen.
   The dollar had gained 0.37 yen on Monday.
   Today's gain also came despite a cut in the prime lending rate
by major U.S. banks. Lower interest rates tend to make a country's
currency less attractive to investors.
   ``The yen is getting weak because nobody wants to buy it now,''
said Akio Nakanishi, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``The rumor came a little before the morning closing at 11 a.m.
(9 p.m. EST Monday) and market players sold the yen all at once,''
he added.
   ``I thought the rumor was a little bit strange ... but it really
affected the market,'' Nakanishi said, adding that investors felt
the dollar was a safer investment tool.
   The rumor concerned Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a former minister of
international trade and industry said to be close to a company
president who allegedly offered stocks in a transaction that
brought a $828,000 profit for an aide to former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   The Bank of Japan sold a few million dollars to support the yen
and check the dollar's rise, Nakanishi said.
   The central bank does not comment on its currency market
activities.
   About $11 billion traded hands in spot trading, up from Monday's
$6.49 billion.

   The federal government's debt to neighbors of
a contaminated Ohio weapons plant is getting bigger while
bureaucrats juggle accounts and try to figure out which one to tap.
   ``We're talking about an additional $20,000 a day in interest,
attorney Stanley Chesley, who won the court-ordered settlement,
said Monday. ``They're up to $2 million and they'll owe another
$20,000 tomorrow and the day after that.''
   That's in addition to the minimum $73 million agreed to in the
settlement.
   At a meeting Monday with Henry Gill, the Energy Department
lawyer who handled the case filed by neighbors of the
government-owned uranium processing plant at Fernald, Ohio, Chesley
said he asked to get the settlement money in the bank as soon as
possible.
   The settlement was approved in September and U.S. District Judge
Arthur Spiegel ordered the Energy Department to deposit the money
in Cincinnati banks by Oct. 15.
   But that deadline slipped because of a government appeal that
subsequently was dropped. However, the government has been unable
to figure out the mechanics of complying with the settlement, said
Gill. The government lawyer said special legislation may be needed
to authorize payment.

<HEAD>Industry Critic Hails USTR `Retreat'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American cigarette makers may lose the U.S.
government as an ally in quest of foreign markets to replace
declining domestic sales, says an industry critic, Rep. Chester
Atkins, D-Mass.
   That's the meaning of the U.S. Trade Representative's recent
decision to handle a market-opening industry petition through GATT,
the 100-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Atkins told
a Monday gathering sponsored by the American Cancer Society.
   The petition of the U.S. Cigarette Export Association had asked
the USTR to press Thailand to open its markets to American
cigarettes and brand promotion under threat of trade retaliation,
similar to recent efforts gaining entry into the Japanese, South
Korean and Taiwanese markets.
   ``For the first time, USTR has failed to deliver for the
cigarette industry'' because ``America's dark secret of cigarette
exports has been exposed in the sunlight of public scrutiny,''
Atkins said.
   Submitting part of the Thailand petition for negotiations by
GATT changes the deadline from May until Nov. 25 for action on the
industry demands, USTR spokeswoman Janet Roell said Monday,
confirming the action.
   USTR asked GATT to handle negotiations with Thailand on grounds
that its import ban and higher taxes on foreign tobacco content
violate GATT rules, Ms. Roell said.

<HEAD>FAA May Require That Infants, Toddlers Have Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says it
will revise safety requirements for infants and toddlers traveling
on airliners.
   FAA Administrator James Busey said Monday that the agency's
eventual action, which could be two years away, may mean that
adults traveling with children under age 2 will have to buy tickets
for the youngsters and, perhaps, have them secured in FAA-approved
child seats.
   Current FAA quidelines allow a child under age 2 to ride for
free on an adult's lap.
   A representative of the Association of Flight Attendants, which
strongly supports putting children under age 2 in some sort of
restraints, commented after Busey's announcement that ``it's
ludicrous that there are FAA regulations in place to restrain
carry-on baggage while babies are allowed to fly around the cabin
during a crash.''
   If Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole approves the FAA
proposal to write rules for the airlines' youngest passengers, a
formal notice will be printed in the Federal Register.
   The public will then have 90 days to comment. An FAA spokesman
said hearings may be held.

<HEAD>Ethnic Turkish Immigrants Say No Rush to Return to Bulgaria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VEDAT ERDAMAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Turks who fled
from Bulgaria last year are not flocking back over the border
despite the new Bulgarian leadership's decision to restore rights
for the minority group.
   ``The relaxation of restrictions in Bulgaria on the rights of
the Turkish minority may eventually affect the situation, but we
have seen no sign of it so far,'' said Unal Erkan, the governor of
Edirne, a western border town.
   Some of the 320,000 ethnic Turks who streamed from Bulgaria to
Turkey last summer have returned, but most appear to be watching
and waiting to see if Bulgaria's new reform-minded Communist
leaders make good on their promise to end a forced assimilation
campaign.
   Ethnic Turks had to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones and
were forbidden to speak Turkish or practice Islamic rites under
meaures instituted six years ago by hard-line Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov, who was ousted in November.
   The new government in Sofia announced on Dec. 29 that it would
rescind the policies affecting the 1.2-million-strong minority.
   The action, however, has prompted protests and work stoppages in
the country of 9 million. The demonstrations have been led by
members of Bulgaria's Slavic majority suspicious of the loyalties
of the ethnic Turks.
   ``The separation of Turk and Bulgarian and discrimination
against us will never stop,'' said Fikret Gocgeldi, a 34-year-old
bus driver who took part in last summer's exodus and now lives in
Edirne, which lies near Turkey's border with Bulgaria and Greece.
   The Kapikule border gate in Edirne was nearly deserted, with
only a family of four waiting to depart. It was a far cry from the
scene last summer, when cars packed with possessions jammed the
border gate.
   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Turks streamed into Turkey after
the Bulgarian government provided them with passports following
bloody demonstrations for minority rights in May.
   About 4,000 people were entering Turkey daily until the
government in Ankara imposed a visa requirement in August to stem
the tide. Thousands of ethnic Turks subsequently returned to their
native land, citing a lack of housing and jobs in Turkey and
separation from family members who had to wait a long time for
visas.
   By Monday, the returnees numbered 96,500, border officials said.
But, they added, only about 100 were returning daily, compared with
a 1,000 a month ago, and about 50 ethnic Turks were still coming in
each day.
   At the train station in Edirne, 20 ethnic Turks, most of them
elderly, were waiting for the train to Bulgaria.
   ``This is no place for older people. I cannot enter any job, I
am only free to enter the mosque,'' said Kadir Mehmet, 60.
   Since last summer, the immigrants have become settled in Turkey.
In Edirne, the ethnic Turks have been moved from tents to small,
prefabricated houses set up on a treeless, windswept lot. Despite
the harsh living conditions, they appear determined to stay.
   The rest of the immigrants have dispersed throughout Turkey,
with about one-fourth of the group settling in the western city of
Bursa and the second-largest group going to Istanbul.
   Most leaders of the immigrant community have expressed support
publicly for the policies of the new Bulgarian authorities,
apparently following the lead of the Turkish government.
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz has denounced the protest
demonstrations in Bulgaria but praised the country's government for
reiterating its promise to restore ethnic rights.
   Yilmaz has said Turkey believes the demonstrations against the
restoration of minority rights were prompted by local officials
loyal to the ousted Zhivkov regime. He has expressed hope for their
replacement.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says his trip to
Central America in the wake of U.S. military intervention in Panama
will test his diplomatic skill.
   President Bush said Friday that Quayle would be sent for
face-to-face talks with leaders, some of whom have been critical of
the action that removed Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega from power and
brought him to Miami to face drug charges.
   Quayle said Monday he will go on the mission in a few weeks, but
he did not specify a date. It has not been determined which
countries he will visit, but it is expected he will attend the
presidential inauguration in Honduras Jan. 27.
   ``I will be interested to hear what they have to say,
privately,'' Quayle told reporters. ``What they say privately
sometimes is not the same as what they say in public. This mission
at the request of the president will be one of strong consultation
that shows sensitivity toward Latin American countries.''

<TEXT>
   For former President Reagan, it was more
than just another stop after another speech.
   And for the children he met at the Casa de Los Ninos crisis
shelter, it likely left an indelible impression.
   One small girl remarked proudly, ``I've seen him on TV before.''
   Another child said meeting the former president ``was neat.''
   When one child asked him if being president had been fun, Reagan
said, ``The job wasn't invented just for having fun, but I must say
I enjoyed it.'' When another asked him, ``Do you like us?'' he
replied, ``If I didn't I wouldn't be here. I've heard about you and
now I'm here to see you.''
   And when the children proudly gave him notes and drawings they
had made, he responded with jelly beans for the kids, and advice
that he ate them ``instead of smoking, and they're a lot better for
you than smoking.''
   Sister Kathleen Clark, the shelter's founding director, gave
Reagan a book about the non-sectarian, non-profit center
established in 1973 that currently handles about 1,000 children
from infancy to age 11 each year.
   Reagan signed autographs for the children after being greeted by
two sisters with a bouquet of daisies. Two other youngsters held up
a banner to greet him. One of the, 9-year-old Michael Fiscella,
admitted he was ``nervous.''
   But as he showed up, about 15 people across the street from the
shelter held signs and hurled criticism of the Reagan and Bush
administrations' policies in Central America.
   After touring the shelter Monday, Reagan told reporters he was
pleased Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega is in American
custody and will face trial in the United States.
   But he declined further comment about the deposed Panamanian
general, saying he did not want to harm chances for a fair trial or
the case American prosecutors have against Noriega.
   As for the protesters, Reagan said, ``I'm sorry that they're so
ignorant about that situation.''
   Earlier, the 79-year-old former president delivered a private
speech to a microcomputer trade group.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Gambling Away Armored Car Heist Reportedly Ready to
Surrender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a former Delaware prosecutor
gambled away $651,000 stolen in a Philadelphia armored car heist
and now wants to surrender, according to published reports.
   ``I stole the money because I thought I could quadruple it
through gambling _ and then I would give half to the company I
stole it from,'' said a letter apparently written by Edward Leigh
Hunt Jr., a federal fugitive.
   Hunt was a guard on the armored truck that was robbed in January
1988.
   ``I used my gambling system, but I lost it all,'' said the
letter, postmarked in suburban Inglewood and sent to The News
Journal in Wilmington, Del.
   ``We're still looking for him,'' an FBI official in Los Angeles
said, according to the Los Angeles Times today.
   The letter states that Hunt wishes to surrender to authorities
at the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 20, the second
anniversary of the robbery.
   Enclosed was a photograph showing a picture of a shaggy-haired
Hunt emerging from a swimming pool at a hotel or apartment.
   Federal agents who have been looking for Hunt since the 1988
robbery say they're pretty sure the letter is legitimate.
   ``As far as we're concerned at this point, they both look valid
_ the letter and the photo,'' said FBI Agent John Kundts in
Philadelphia.
   People familiar with Hunt identified the handwriting as his,
according to News Journal editors.
   ``I have a good story for your newspaper,'' Hunt wrote in his
letter dated Dec. 20.
   ``I am one of the most wanted criminals in the United States,''
he said, describing the crime. ``For this crime I was featured
twice on the national TV show, `America's Most Wanted.'''
   The 26-year-old said he planned to surrender because he missed
his family and wanted to come clean. He said he was sorry about the
crime.
   The fugitive's father, Edward Leigh Hunt, Sr., a deputy attorney
general in Delaware from 1973 to 1975, said he was sure the
photograph was of his son.
   Police initially believed Hunt had been abducted, but he soon
became the primary suspect.
   A federal grand jury in Philadelphia indicted Hunt on April 26,
1988, on interstate theft.
   ``Absent any information to the contrary, we would certainly
intend to be there at the appointed hour,'' Kundts said of Hunt's
apparent offer to surrender.
   Susan Pasternak, a spokeswoman at the Los Angeles Area Chamber
of Commerce, said Monday she had no idea why the fugitive would
want to surrender there.
   ``And the 20th is a Saturday,'' she said ``We're normally closed
on Saturdays.''

<HEAD>Sources Say Government Preparing to Lift Martial Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese leaders were preparing today to end
martial law in Tiananmen Square, the cradle of the crushed
pro-democracy movement, and possibly lift the restrictions
elsewhere in the capital, sources said.
   The end of the 7-month-old emergency would be mainly symbolic
because troops already have been withdrawn from city streets.
   It would not mean greater freedom of dissent, because most
activities banned under martial law, such as anti-government
demonstrations and speeches, are illegal under other laws.
   However, Communist authorities hope it will reassure foreign
governments and the World Bank that stability has been restored and
that soft loans should be restored. The loans were frozen in June
after troops cleared the city center of pro-democracy protesters,
killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Authorities also hope that an end to martial law will reassure
foreign tourists, few of whom have come since martial law was
imposed.
   The action was to be announced at midnight (11 a.m. EST), said
Chinese sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It may be directed in particular at the United States, where it
would enable President Bush to tell critics that his softening of
sanctions against China had a positive effect.
   A Western diplomat in Hong Kong linked it to U.S. National
Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft's controversial December visit to
Beijing.
   When Premier Li Peng announced martial law in central Beijing on
May 20 for the first time in the 40-year history of the People's
Republic, he said it was necessary to stem massive pro-democracy
protests led by students.
   However, the protests were not halted until the army came into
the city shooting on June 3-4, bent on dispersing students camped
out in Tiananmen, a massize square that is the symbolic seat of
power in China.
   Martial law forbids marches, strikes, class boycotts, public
speeches, distributing pamphlets, spreading rumors and other
``destructive activity.'' It also gives soldiers and police
authority to take any measures necessary to maintain order.
   However, a law passed in November outlaws all but pro-government
demonstrations and authorizes security forces to stop illegal
protests. In addition, the constitution prohibits ``disruption of
the socialist system,'' giving the government broad authority to
curb any dissent.
   Chinese sources said the government canceled plans to lift
martial law in December after the popular uprising in Romania
ousted hard-line Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Students at several Beijing campuses put up illegal posters
ridiculing Ceausescu and Chinese leaders, and tried to demonstrate
on campus.
   Tens of thousands of soldiers were brought into Beijing in
response and were put on top alert. They remained mostly out of
sight, in keeping with a gradual reduction of the military profile
in the city since the summer.
   On Oct. 31, authorities withdrew troops from key intersections
and replaced them in Tiananmen Square with People's Armed Police, a
special force that guards government installations.
   Soldiers remain billeted inside the Museum of Revolutionary
History on the east side of the square, and have been seen drilling
inside the former imperial palace grounds north of the square. They
also remain camped in dozens of military compounds in and around
the city.
   Plainclothes police also have been seen in greater numbers on
campuses.

<TEXT>
   During a three-hour space walk, cosmonauts at the
Mir orbiting complex installed equipment to improve their craft's
navigation system, the official Tass news agency said today.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov were in
good health after completing the mission early today, Tass said,
adding that installation of the two ``stellar transducers'' was a
success.
   Radio Moscow said the new sensors were required because of the
docking last month of another research module that changed the
configuration of the Mir complex to an L-shape. That made a new
orientation system necessary, it said.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have been aboard the Mir complex since

   More heavy rain and high wind battered the Northwest today after
a series of Western storms derailed a 35-car train, knocked down
giant trees and sheared roofs from buildings, causing millions of
dollars in damage.
   Heavy snow, meanwhile, coated parts of the mid-Atlantic region
today.
   The Western storms were blamed for at least three deaths.
   Sustained hurricane-force winds sweeping over the Rockies blew
trucks off roads.
   ``The air just screamed down out of the mountains,'' said
meteorologist Jim Wirshborn.
   In Washington, Oregon and Idaho, forecasters said the latest
storm was not expected to be as severe as its predecessors.
   The National Weather Service said the storm came ashore along
the central Oregon coast early this morning, with gusts up to 64
mph at Cape Blanco.
   Urban flood warnings were issued this morning for Vancouver,
Wash., and Portland, Ore., because of wind-strewn debris clogging
drains.
   ``This place looks like Hurricane Hugo struck us,'' said Carol
Cubbage of West Linn, Ore. On one street, 14 huge trees toppled,
smashing three houses in a row.
   ``It has been years since I've seen Douglas fir trees that big
that were literally uprooted,'' said Gary Donnelly, a spokesman for
Pacific Power &amp; Light Co. ``Some of them were 4 and 5 feet in
diameter.''
   Throughout the Northwest, parked cars, mobile homes and
buildings were damaged by falling trees. Several highways were
closed temporarily Monday because of tipped over trailers, debris
and mudslides.
   By Monday afternoon, 25,000 damage claims for an estimated $12.5
million had been filed with four major Northwest insurance
carriers, the Western Insurance Information Service said. ``The
damage is widespread,'' said spokeswoman Marianne Macina.
   The region was buffeted by sustained winds of up to 70 mph. A
130 mph gust was clocked on Rattlesnake Hill, north of Pasco,
Wash., near the Hanford nuclear reservation.
   More than 5,000 customers remained without electricity in
Washington state and Oregon.
   Mapleton, about 15 miles inland from the Oregon coast, received
8.1 inches of rain from Saturday to Monday.
   At least six small airplanes that were parked at regional
airports in Prosser, Walla Walla and Pullman, Wash., were damaged
or destroyed by winds.
   Scores of windows were blown out of buildings and dozens of
large trees were toppled Monday at Washington State University at
Pullman and eight miles away at the University of Idaho in Moscow.
Officials estimated damage at up to $100,000 at each university.
   In southwest Portland, a power outage Monday caused a spill of
an estimated 128,000 gallons of sewage into Fanno Creek, while
about 150,000 gallons of sewage spilled from a treatment plant in
Toledo into Yaquina Bay before the spill was stopped.
   High winds without rain whipped across the Rockies and were
expected to continue through the week.
   In Colorado, gusts reached 110 mph in Boulder and 108 mph near
Fort Collins on Monday, the weather service said.
   The wind tore roofs from buildings in Fort Collins, Boulder and
Colorado Springs, and blew semi tractor-trailers off roads in
Colorado Springs and Boulder.
   Strong winds in southeastern Wyoming blew off part of a high
school gymnasium roof Monday, a day after a strong gust knocked a
nearly empty 35-car freight train off its tracks. No injuries were
reported.
   In northwestern Wyoming, a storm dumped more than 1 foot of snow
in the mountains by late Monday.
   Cheyenne Central High School students taking a physical
education class were in the gym at about 2 p.m. when the wind
ripped a 4-by-4-foot hole in the roof. No injuries were reported.
   The storms were blamed for the death of a 21-year-old man who
died Monday when his car slammed into a truck stopped in a dust
cloud on a road near Big Springs, Neb. An 11-year-old girl was
struck and killed Sunday by a falling tree in Yachats, Ore. A
23-year-old man died in a car crash on a rain-slickened road in
Benton County, Ore.
   On the East Coast, fist-size snowflakes coated parts of
Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania with at least 4 inches of
snow _ up to 9 inches in the mountains. Lesser snowfall was
reported in New York's Catskills mountains.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed today
that they sent Cambodia's president and premier fleeing to Vietnam
with a grenade attack on the capital in which soldiers and
policemen were killed.
   The reported attack Saturday would be the most serious in Phnom
Penh, largely spared in the 11-year-old war between the guerrillas
and the Vietnamese-installed government.
   It could not be verified and some previous communist Khmer Rouge
claims have proven exaggerated.
   Also today, the non-communist resistance forces of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, allies of the Khmer Rouge, said their agents
exploded a grenade a day in the capital between Dec. 5 and 10,
wounding 16 Vietnamese and two Cambodian policemen.
   A statement said one attack occurred near Premier Hun Sen's
house and others in front of the Royal Palace and the Ministry of
Defense.
   The government's SPK news agency, monitored in Bangkok today,
did not mention any attack but stressed that Sunday's National Day
celebrations took place in ``total security.'' It said Saturday and
Monday also were peaceful.
   National Day marks the anniversary of the 1979 downfall of the
Khmer Rouge, which was driven out by invading Vietnamese troops
after a 3{-year reign of terror in which it tried to turn the
country into a primitive agrarian commune, killing hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians.
   SPK denied reports that a lack of security in the capital had
forced Hun Sen to go to the eastern province of Svay Rieng to meet
with Australia's deputy foreign secretary, Michael Costello, on
Sunday and Monday.
   The agency said Hun Sen was making an inspection tour of the
province bordering Vietnam and had invited Costello to meet him
there.
   Costello told reporters upon arriving in Bangkok today that the
meeting took place and was arranged for Svay Rieng ``well before''
the alleged Khmer Rouge attacks. He could not confirm the attacks.
   The guerrillas earlier had said they attacked and set ablaze
Cambodia's second-largest city, Battambang, Friday and Saturday. A
Western diplomat in Thailand confirmed today that the town was
attacked but said ``the effect was more psychological than
strategic.''
   Khmer Rouge army radio said resistance forces had lobbed five
grenades in the center of Phnom Penh near the office of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, killing or wounding some
Vietnamese and ``lackey puppets.''
   It said the attack took place at 2 a.m. Saturday.
   Another Khmer Rouge army broadcast said the guerrillas, aided by
citizens and government officials, attacked the capital's center
and suburbs Saturday with ``32 grenades and TNT plastic explosives,
killing or wounding some Vietnamese soldiers and puppets who were
drinking near a hotel.''
   ``A number of Vietnamese secret agents and puppet policemen ...
were also killed by blasts from the grenades and plastic explosives
in the suburbs,'' it said. The broadcast claimed Vietnam
``immediately sent Hun Sen and (President) Heng Samrin as well as
some other leaders to Ho Chi Minh City.''
   The city, formerly Saigon, is about 35 miles east of the border
at Svay Rieng. The broadcast said Hun Sen later went to Svay Rieng
for his scheduled talks with Costello.
   ``The Vietnamese dared not allow Hun Sen to see Costello in
Phnom Penh because of security reasons,'' it said.
   SPK said Monday that Hun Sen had agreed with Australia's
proposal for a U.N. role in an interim administration in Cambodia
before a general election _ but only if the U.N. seat held by the
guerrilla coalition is first vacated.
   The Khmer Rouge fields about 30,000 fighters and is the largest
of three guerrilla groups in a resistance coalition.
   Fears of a possible return to power of the Khmer Rouge have
increased as they have made major battlefield advances since
Vietnam in September made what it called the withdrawal of its last
troops from Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said the guerrillas would keep fighting
and attacking the capital until an international authority verifies
Vietnam's withdrawal and a coalition government including the Heng
Samrin government and the three guerrilla groups is formed.
   In Paris on Monday, diplomatic sources said representatives of
the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members would meet there
on Jan. 15 to consider ways to bring peace to Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge seized the rich gem-mining town of Pailin in
western Battambang province bordering Thailand on Oct. 22.
   They claimed they hit Battambang town starting at midnight
Friday, attacking military posts there and in Banteay Meanchey and
western Pursat province. Fighting still raged at dawn Saturday,
said a guerrilla radio broadcast Sunday.
   In an interview broadcast over state radio Sunday, Cambodia's
defense minister Gen. Tea Banh admitted that guerrillas are
advancing in areas near the Thai border, and said his forces are
abandoning some places to concentrate defenses in major towns and
roads.
   ``To be sincere, we have lost some positions,'' he said. ``We
cannot stay in every village. We have to abandon some and keep some
strategic ones.''
   He did not mention fighting in Phnom Penh or in Battambang.

<HEAD>Semiconductor Makers Cutting 1-Megabit Memory Chip Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading Japanese semiconductor makers said today
that they plan 10 percent to 15 percent cuts in production of key
1-megabit memory chips because of falling prices and lower demand.
   Demand for 1-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips, or
DRAMs, has fallen in recent months, in large part because of
stagnant sales of personal computers in the United States, company
officials said.
   A 1-megabit chip, currently a mainstay of the computer industry,
can store about 1 million binary units of information, the
equivalent of about four newspaper pages.
   An official at NEC Corp., the world's largest semiconductor
maker, said his company has decided to reduce production from 6
million chips to about 5 million chips a month in the first quarter
of this year.
   ``With the price for a 1-megabit DRAM falling from around $24
last summer to $9.70 today, NEC has decided to downshift
production,'' he said.
   Although computer sales in Japan have remained stronger than in
the United States, prices of 1-megabit DRAMs also have fallen here,
from $14 to about $10.50.
   The semiconductor industry is known for its sharp business
cycles. During a 1985-86 industry recession, Japanese makers,
suffering from overcapacity, lost an estimated $4 billion and began
a series of price cuts that led to charges of dumping overseas.
   An Oki Electric official said his company plans to reduce its
production of 1-megabit DRAMs this quarter from 3.5 million chips
to fewer than 3 million chips a month.
   Hitachi's production has fallen from 4 million chips to about
3.8 million chips a month, while Mitsubishi Electric's monthly
production has fallen from about 5 million chips to between 4
million and 4.5 million chips, company officials said. A Hitachi
official said further cuts were possible if the market continues to
weaken.
   Fujitsu officials declined to comment on their production plans.
   A Toshiba Corp. official said production in the first quarter
will fall from the current 9 million chips a month to below 8
million chips but could pick up again in the second quarter in
response to a resurgence in demand.
   But the Mitsubishi Electric official, who like the other
officials spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that a
recovery of the DRAM market would not occur until later, possibly
after the end of summer.
   Japan produced 85 percent of the world's 1-megabit DRAM chips in
1988, according to Dataquest, a U.S. research firm. U.S. firms
accounted for 8 percent of production, South Korean companies 4
percent and European makers 3 percent, it said. The figures do not
include International Business Machines, which produces memory
chips mainly for its own use.

   The case of a young physician who claims she
contracted AIDS because of a hospital's negligence is one that
cannot be won, no matter what the jury decides in her $175 million
lawsuit, her lawyer told the court.
   ``This nightmare will end with her death,'' Diane Wilner,
attorney for Dr. Veronica Prego, said in opening arguments.
   ``Ultimately, there can be no happy ending.''
   Prego, appearing drawn and distraught, watched quietly Monday as
Wilner described her to the state court jury as a promising young
doctor whose life and career hopes were prematurely ended when she
pricked her finger with an AIDS-tainted needle on Jan. 12, 1983.
   Prego, now 32, was a 25-year-old medical-school graduate working
under a licensed physician in preparation for a hospital internship
when she was cleaning up after a supervising intern, Dr. Joyce
Fogel, at the Kings County Hospital.
   The lawyer said Prego reached into a tangle of gauze and bed
linens in which Fogel had left a bloody, infected needle.
   ``As she was picking up the remaining garbage, she got stuck by
a needle,'' Wilner said.
   ``That needle is the instrument of death.''
   Prego is suing the city's Health and Hospitals Corp., the
hospital and Fogel and another doctor, charging their negligence
caused her to contract acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Testimony was scheduled to continue today.
   Stanley D. Friedman, the lawyer for the health agency, did not
dispute that Prego had been pricked by a needle, but questioned her
memory of the details and said the accident was caused by her
carelessness, not Fogel's.
   Friedman maintains Prego, not Fogel, withdrew the blood from the
AIDS patient, who died a few days later, and then carelessly
``grabbed'' a handful of soiled hospital waste holding the infected
needle.
   ``Do we have to train somebody not to grab?'' he asked. ``She
wasn't requested to pick up anything by anybody.''
   Prego, who graduated from medical school in her native
Argentina, argues that the hospital failed to provide proper
containers for soiled needles. The agency claims the hospital was
in the forefront of following precautions against a disease that
doctors knew little about in the early 1980s.
   Prego tested positive for HIV _ the AIDS virus _ in 1985 when
she agreed to take part in a study.
   Two years later, she came down with AIDS and nearly died, Wilner
said.
   Prego, who refuses to talk to reporters about her case, intends
to testify. The trial is expected to take at least a month.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's estimated
80,000 troops in Czechoslovakia, deployed after the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion, should pull out by the end of this year, a foreign
ministry spokesman said today.
   ``I suggest that the Soviet troops should withdraw from
Czechoslovakia by the end of 1990,'' spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky was
quoted by the state news agency CTK as telling journalists.
   The spokesman was not immediately available to confirm the
comment.
   Czechoslovakia's new foreign minister, former dissident Jiri
Dienstbier, returned from Moscow last month saying the Soviets and
Czechoslovaks will open talks this month on withdrawing the Soviet
troops in Czechoslovakia.
   They entered the country during the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms in August 1968 and have since
remained under agreements that the new coalition government in
Czechoslovakia considers null and void.
   The agreements were signed in August and October of 1968 after
the invasion, which has now been condemned by the Soviet Union and
the four other Warsaw Pact nations who took part.
   Czechoslovakia considers the agreements were ``null and void
from the very beginning,'' Dobrovsky was quoted as saying by CTK,
which gave no further details of his comments.

<HEAD>Army Says Female MP Rushed to Scene When Firing Started</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: adds graf of additional material from LA Times story</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military officials say a female captain
praised for leading a unit into combat in Panama was a half-mile
away at the start of the fight but gave the critical orders and
rushed to the scene when the firing began.
   The Los Angeles Times had published a Saturday story that the
Army said news accounts of Capt. Linda Bray's involvement in the
battle _ at a Panamanian Defense Forces kennel _ ``later repeated
by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, were grossly
exaggerated.''
   In an interview Monday, Gen. William McClain said Bray had been
in her tactical command center, directing her troops by radio, and
that she went to the scene as soon as she was aware fighting had
broken out.
   ``Her job was to direct her forces and to accomplish her
objective and that's what she did,'' McClain said. ``If she's in
radio contact, and gave the order for the warning shot to be fired,
that's leading your troops.''
   Bray's involvement as commander of the 988th Military Police Co.
got front-page attention last week, based on accounts from Panama
followed by Fitzwater's praise at the White House. President Bush
spoke Friday of her ``heroic performance.''
   The incident prompted calls for the removal of restrictions on
women in combat, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said she
would propose legislation to that end.
   Various news accounts, including one carried by The Associated
Press, quoted soldiers as saying Bray had led her unit into battle,
storming the gates of the kennel in an armored jeep.
   News accounts of the battle's duration have ranged from a
half-hour or so up to three hours. An account of the incident
released by the Pentagon runs from 1 a.m. until daylight, but
doesn't directly address the exact time of the firefight.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood made available a
description of the mission involving Bray, which states that she
ordered a warning shot to be fired 30 seconds after a
Spanish-speaking U.S. officer announced over a loudspeaker that the
occupants of the PDF barracks should surrender.
   The captain then ordered machine-gun fire against the side of
the building, away from its occupants, and the PDF fired on the
military police unit, the account said.
   After the Spanish-speaking officer used the loudspeaker to bluff
that the military police had artillery, the PDF forces retreated
from the building and continued to fire at the MPs from a nearby
wooded area, the account said. Bray ordered flares to light the
area and then ordered her officers to clear the area around the
building, it said.
   The area was declared more secure at daylight and Bray's troops
were ordered to pull back, the account said.
   At one point, Wood added, Bray ordered the driver of her armored
jeep to run over the barracks' gate so that she could get closer to
her troops.
   The Times story said, ``It was not clear how the inflated
account of Bray's exploits began.'' It said she was interviewed
extensively by her superiors after questiosn were raised about the
initial press accounts and denied being the source of the more
elaborate reports of her unit's action.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Faults Timing of Dispatch of Ships</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with Sen. Kerry remarks on TV; picks up at
pvs 2nd graf, The aircraft</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate narcotics and
terrorism subcommittee said today the Bush administration used bad
judgment in dispatching ships to Colombia to fight drugs so soon
after it invaded Panama.
   However, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he believes it is
appropriate for the U.S. Navy to play a role off the Colombian
coast at the right time.
   Reacting to opposition from Latin American nations, the
administration said Monday is it postponing plans to position ships
off the Colombian coast.
   ``Now it's on hold and I think that's appropriate,'' Kerry said
on the ``CBS This Morning'' show. ``I think clearly the
administration made a mistake in moving unilaterally and I think
also the timing immediately post-Panama was difficult.''
   He said is was ``very complicated'' from the standpoint of
internal Colombian politics for the United States to be making such
moves at the present time.
   ``On the other hand I don't think it's inappropriate for the
United States to seek to implement better surveillance of flights
and of traffic within the region,'' said Kerry. ``I just think the
process has to be worked out more effectively.''
   The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy and the cruiser USS
Virginia maneuvered in the Atlantic off the Florida coast Monday in
a visible symbol of the diplomatic circling occurring in Washington
and Bogota.
   Administration officials said their future deployment near
Colombia would depend on talks with that country's government.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration was still considering use of the Navy to combat drug
shipping but she said a blockade is not among the options.
   ``A blockade would mean shutting down everything, and that,
obviously, is not our intention,'' she said.
   Colombian officials had accused the United States of moving
toward a naval and air blockade over the weekend after reports that
the carrier group had left port and was preparing to take part in
sea-based actions against drug trafficking.
   But a statement issued Monday by the Colombian Embassy said the
United States had said it would not interfere with Colombian flag
ships, even on the high seas, without the permission of Colombian
Defense Ministry.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with
President Bush on a trip to Orlando, Fla., said no agreement had
been reached in preliminary discussions and praised the Colombian
government for its cooperation on earlier occasions.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney plans to unveil the administration's plans
for military involvement in the anti-drug battle next week.
   In Denver, Cheney told reporters that although U.S. laws limit
the role the military can play in drug enforcement in this country
``we do have the capability ... to help identify drug traffickers
trying to smuggle drugs to the United States.''
   Cheney said that U.S. ships can interdict vessels suspected of
carrying drugs from Latin America in international waters but that
the United States will not take naval action without the
cooperation of other nation's in the region.

<HEAD>Cases Could Affect Affirmative Action Programs</HEAD>

   All federal affirmative action programs, from
education to employment, could be affected as the Supreme Court
studies special preferences given to TV and radio stations owned by
women and minorities.
   ``We can count heads at the Supreme Court, and we're confident
these FCC policies will fall,'' said Alan Shurberg, a computer
consultant involved in one of two cases the court accepted for
review Monday.
   ``Government will be left with a colorblind standard,'' Shurberg
said.
   The justices said they would use a Florida case to review the
Federal Communications Commission's policy of treating ownership by
women and minorities as a favorable factor when awarding licenses.
   The court also voted to review, in a Connecticut case, the
commission's policy of allowing any station facing a license
revocation to sell its license, at a reduced price, to a
minority-owned company.
   Different three-judge panels of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here upheld the licensing preferences policy, but struck
down the so-called distress sale program.
   ``Those of us concerned about diversity in society are concerned
about what the court may do with these cases,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman of the Washington-based Media Access Project.
   The court's decisions, he said, could be worded broadly enough
to affect government programs beyond the broadcasting industry.
   ``But exploring the importance of minority ownership in the mass
media _ and the significant role diversity in the media plays _ is
a good way for the court to review those issues,'' he said.
   Shurberg, of Rocky Hill, Conn., said he hoped the high court
would use the two cases to ``put an end to all affirmative action.''
   He said his confidence was boosted by recent Supreme Court
decisions that have curtailed what steps governments may take to
make up for past discriminatory practices.
   Decisions in the two cases are expected by July.
   The federal government, as have state and local governments, for
years has adopted numerous programs aimed at giving special help to
members of groups traditionally made the targets of bias.
   For example, those companies doing business with the federal
government must certify that they make good-faith efforts to
integrate their workforces.
   Another example is Congress' setting aside a fixed percentage of
all federal public works contracts for minority-owned companies.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to decide in a Minnesota case whether governors may
withhold National Guard troops the federal government wants to send
on training missions in foreign countries.
   _Refused in a case from New York to force a revival of the
``fairness doctrine,'' under which the federal government could
require radio and television stations to present all sides of
controversial issues.
   _Let stand a ruling in an Iowa case that people have no
constitutionally protected right of privacy in the conversations
they have while using cordless telephones.
   _Refused to reinstate a $9.4 million award, won and then lost,
by the family of a Texas woman whose husband hired her killer
through an ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine.
   _Agreed to decide in a case stemming from a 1972 Idaho silver
mine disaster that killed 91 people whether labor unions may be
sued in state courts for failure to assure safe conditions.
   _Turned down the appeal of a Tennessee high school student
pulled from a race for student council president after giving a
speech officials deemed disrespectful.

   Officials in the northern state of
Jammu-Kashmir said Moslem separatists fatally shot a police officer
today, and witnesses said police opened fire to disperse Moslem
demonstrators in Srinagar, killing two people.
   The separatists also set fire to government buildings to protest
alleged police brutality, officials said.
   Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on Srinagar and three
other towns and called out the army to prevent further violence, a
state government spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said 15 people were killed today and Monday but he did not give any
breakdown of the deaths.
   On Monday, at least 14 people were killed and more than 100
injured when police opened fire on demonstrators in Srinagar and
the neighboring town of Sopore, witnesses said. At least one of the
injured people died of their wounds today, they said.
   Chief Secretary Moosa Raza, the state's top civil servant, said
an inspector from the intelligence wing of the police was shot and
killed by Moslem militants in Bureava, 19 miles west of Srinagar.
   In Bandipur, 28 miles north of Srinagar, demonstrators set two
government buildings ablaze, he said.
   Scores of people have been killed in the state in recent weeks
as police cracked down on Moslems seeking independence for the
Kashmir region of the state or union with neighboring Pakistan.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is the only state with a Moslem majority in
India, where 82 percent of the national population of 880 million
is Hindu.
   India and predominantly Moslem Pakistan have fought three wars
over Kashmir since both gained independence in 1947. Part of
Kashmir is under Pakistan's control. A cease-fire line monitored by
the United Nations divides the region into Indian and Pakistani
sectors.
   Moslems comprise 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people.
The Kashmir part of the state is mostly Moslem, while the Jammu
section is mostly Hindu. Nationwide, Moslems account for about 12
percent of India's population.
   Srinagar is the summer capital of the state and Jammu, 95 miles
to the south, is the winter capital.

   Six men were killed and at
least 31 were injured today when hundreds of striking and
non-striking rail workers battled with clubs, machetes, and other
weapons at a train station near Johannesburg, police said.
   Union spokesmen said they received reports of more than 20
people killed and more than 60 injured. The reports could not be
confirmed.
   Bodies still lay in blood-soaked train cars two hours after the
clash. Rocks, sticks and homemade weapons were strewn around the
cars and the platform.
   It was by far the worst incident of violence during the 10-week
strike by black workers against the white-led government's
transport company. About 10 people have been killed in previous
strike-related incidents and several dozen railway cars have been
destroyed in arson attacks.
   The union accused non-strikers of an unprovoked attack on
strikers with clubs, knives, machetes and rocks.
   A police spokesman, Col. Frans Malherbe, said the battle
involved about 1,000 black men still working for South African
Transport Services who confronted about 800 strikers in Germiston,
an industrial town southeast of Johannesburg. The strikers had
arrived at the station by train on their way to a union meeting.
   Malherbe said police officers dispersed the combatants with tear
gas after the battle raged 45 minutes. The Congress of South
African Trade Unions, a militant labor federation to which the
strikers are affiliated, said police should have intervened sooner.
   But Malherbe said uniformed officers standing by during the
early stages of the battle probably were railway security guards,
not police.
   About 25,000 workers went on strike against South African
Transport Services in early November, demanding their minimum
monthly wage be increased from $225 to $560. The strikers also are
demanding formal recognition of their union, the South African
Railway and Harbor Workers Union, which has been excluded from
contract talks.
   Negotiations opened last week for the first time since the start
of the strike.
   More than 22,000 strikers have been fired and the union is
demanding their unconditional reinstatement. The company has said
it would re-hire half the fired workers and allow an arbitrator to
determine if any others had been fired unfairly. It has not offered
a wage increase.
   Leon Els, chief spokesman for the transport company, said the
clash made it ``imperative'' that the union respond to management's
latest proposals. He said the company was taking steps ``at the
worker level'' to prevent further clashes.
   The strike is illegal under legislation that bars industrial
action against essential services.
   The transport company employees a total of about 170,000 people,
and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide. Whites hold the
vast majority of management positions in the company.

   Christian army units and Syrian-backed
Moslem militiamen clashed today in Beirut, but a cease-fire between
rival Shiite Moslem militias held for a second day in south Lebanon.
   Police said there were no casualties in the 10-minute exchange
of rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire along Beirut's Green
Line, which divides the capital's Moslem and Christian sectors.
   It was the latest violation of a truce between the Christian
army and Syrian-backed fighters.
   The cease-fire, called Sept. 22 by the Arab League, halted six
months of ferocious artillery duels between Christian army Gen.
Michel Aoun's troops and the Syrian army. That round of fighting in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war killed 929 people and wounded 2,744.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
four people have been killed and 12 wounded in skirmishes along the
three-mile Green Line since Saturday. All but one of the casualties
were civilians, police said.
   In southern Lebanon, rival Shiite Moslem militias withheld fire
while an Iranian envoy struggled to arrange a settlement to the
inter-Shiite fighting that has killed 94 people and wounded 275
since Dec. 23.
   Fighting in southern Iqlim al-Tuffah province eased Monday when
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and Syrian-backed Amal militias agreed to
a seven-hour cease-fire to allow the Red Cross to evacuate bodies
from 17 days of fighting.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Ali Besharati, held
separate talks with Amal and Hezbollah officials at the Iranian
Embassy in Moslem west Beirut, seeking a way to end the groups' war
for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites.
   In the eastern Bekaa valley, Israel's allied militia, the South
Lebanon Army, fired artillery rounds into bases of Syrian-backed
Palestinian and leftist Lebanese guerrillas in the villages of
Sultan Yacoub, Luci and Kamed el-Louz. Police said two villagers
were wounded.
   The Bekaa has long been a launching pad for guerrilla raids into
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon. The
2,500-member South Lebanon Army and an estimated 1,500 Israeli
troops patrol the enclave along the southern border.
   Israel set up the buffer in 1985 to guard against cross-border
guerrilla raids.

   Prosecutors hope to limit evidence about
Robert T. Morris' state of mind at the graduate student's trial on
charges of setting loose a ``worm'' program that crippled a
national computer network.
   Opening arguments were to begin today in the federal court case.
The suspended Cornell University student from Arnold, Md., is the
first person brought to trial under the 1986 Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act.
   If convicted, Morris, 24, faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Prosecutors allege Morris designed and set loose on Nov. 2,
1988, a program that replicated wildly, immobilizing an estimated
6,000 computers linked to the Internet research computer network,
including those at NASA and Air Force facilities.
   Before a jury was seated Monday, Justice Department lawyers
filed a motion aimed at thwarting Morris' expected defense that he
did not intend to paralyze the computer network.
   The government asked U.S. District Judge Howard Munson to limit
examination of witnesses on Morris' state of mind, specifically
whether he intended cause any loss or damage.
   ``Evidence that Morris designed earlier versions of the computer
virus (which were not launched) are relevant to the charges,'' the
government said.
   ``The evidence of lack of intent to cause loss, or lack of
intent to prevent the authorized use of the victim computers,
however, is simply not relevant to any issue in this case,'' said
the Justice Department papers.
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni raised the intent question
during a pre-trial motion, but Munson rejected Guidoboni's argument
that Morris' intentions were pertinent to the legality of the
indictment.
   Morris, who was a first-year doctoral student in computer
studies at Cornell, is the son of the chief scientist at the
government's National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md.
   A Cornell commission concluded that Morris was guilty of
``reckless disregard'' for creating the program. Although the panel
found him responsible, Morris has never publicly admitted creating
the worm or unleashing it.

<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles Times says it has tape
recordings of the comments it quoted Mayor Marion Barry making when
he ridiculed Jesse Jackson and saying Jackson ``don't wanna run
nothing but his mouth.''
   Assistant Managing Editor John Brownwell denied in interviews
Monday that the newspaper's reporter misquoted Barry in a profile.
   The Times quoted Barry in the Sunday profile as saying Jackson,
a former presidential candidate supported by Barry and now a
potential mayoral rival, would become ``the laughingstock of
America'' if he ran for mayor of Washington.
   But Barry told reporters Sunday after attending church, ``I
don't understand it. I couldn't possibly have said what they said I
said. ... I don't talk like that.''
   Brownwell told Washington's WJLA-TV that Barry ``most certainly
did make the comments'' and his newspaper ``reported them
accurately.'' Brownwell said the reporter who wrote the story used
a combination of notes she took while talking to the mayor.
   Brownell told The Washington Post that Barry made the remarks
while talking to the reporter at a local bar.
   Barry refused Monday to elaborate on his earlier remarks and
Jackson declined to comment.
   ``I'm in the process of reading the article,'' he said. ``I have
not read it fully yet. It's a rather long article. After I read it
I will put together a very definitive reaction to it.''
   Barry was quoted in the article as boasting he was
``invincible'' despite being linked to a series of scandals, and
predicting he will get at least 65 percent of the vote in the
Democratic mayoral primary this fall.
   Jackson, who was supported by Barry in his presidential
campaigns, moved from Chicago to Washington last year amid
speculation he would run for mayor. Jackson has said he would not
directly challenge Barry, but he has not flatly ruled out a mayoral
bid and some of his remarks have been seen as suggesting Barry
should not run for re-election.
   Sharon Pratt Dixon, former treasurer of the Democratic National
Committee who is running against Barry for mayor, said the remarks
demonstrated that Barry ``is visibly agitated with Jackson'' and
that ``his judgment is not sound.''

   Edward J. Ennis, a former chairman of the
American Civil Liberties Union and Justice Department official in
charge of enemy aliens during World War II, has died at age 82.
   Ennis, who died Sunday of diabetes complications at Lenox Hill
Hospital, was ACLU general counsel from 1955 to 1969 and president
from 1967 to 1977. During his tenure, he called for the impeachment
of President Nixon and criticized Nixon's pardon.
   Ennis was at the Justice Department for 14 years, working as a
general counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   As director of the alien enemy control unit from 1941 to 1946,
he administered internment and other internal security matters but
strongly opposed the internment of about 70,000 Japanese-Americans
early in the war. He later testified on behalf of some of the
detainees.
   After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1932, Ennis became
an assistant U.S. attorney. He defended the constitutionality of
President Roosevelt's New Deal legislation.
   He is survived by his wife, Marie Joyce.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's ruling Communists said today a
rough election campaign may be ahead and called for a ``fairness
agreement'' among political groups to keep the campaign clean.
   The Communists, plagued by a wave of resignations, have launched
a virtual counteroffensive as they prepare for balloting May 6.
   Still in control of the nation's media, key meeting places and
supplies of such essentials as paper, the Communists have been
accused of unfairly exploiting their formidable power. More than
100,000 people demonstrated against them Monday night.
   The Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung reminded readers
today that the various opposition groups are running for the first
time, and it claimed many candidates feel the need to virtually
shove opponents out of the way.
   ``All this leads to the fear that it could get especially rough
in the coming weeks,'' the Berliner Zeitung said in reference to
the campaign.
   The newspaper's commentary said, however, that such rough going
could be kept in check if all sides reach a ``fairness agreement''
specifying campaign conduct. It did not elaborate.
   ``Experience shows that punches below the belt can't really be
avoided through such an agreement, but they can be kept to a
tolerable amount,'' Berliner Zeitung continued.
   The Communists are fighting for their political survival in East
Germany, which is plagued by shortages of consumer goods and low
worker morale. More than 1,000 East Germans resettle in West
Germany each day, joining the 340,000 who reached the West last
year alone.
   East German Communists also reacted angrily to West German
television plans to beam election information programs into East
Germany. The official party daily Neues Deutschland said that
unlike the opposition parties, the Communists will probably by
shunned by the West German ``news media armada.''
   Opposition groups have accused the Communists of trying to stir
up public fears of a resurgence of rightist activity and use it
against the opposition parties.
   In West Berlin, meanwhile, the head of West Germany's extreme
rightist Republicans said today that the party's East German
members plan to compete in the May election.
   Republican Party chief Franz Schoenhuber, a former Nazi Waffen
SS soldier, told a news conference he estimated the party could
receive 10 percent of the vote.
   The East German leadership has vowed to thwart any attempts by
the Republicans or other right-wing extremists to gain a foothold
in the country.
   More than 150,000 people demonstrated Monday night in nine
cities to keep up pressure on the Communists.
   ``Down with the SED!'' protesters in the city of Leipzig
chanted, using the initials of the Communist Party. They also
called for the ouster of Gregor Gysi, who took over as party chief
just one month ago.
   East Germans ousted hard-line leader Erich Honecker in October
in a peaceful popular revolt and have since kept up steady pressure
on the Communists to act on promises to build a multiparty
democracy.
   Opposition groups in East Berlin came close to breaking off
talks with the Communists on Monday after the government refused to
provide full details about whether the dreaded secret police have
been disbanded.
   Opposition delegates ended the day's talks an hour early,
demanding unanimously that the government submit a report about
internal security at the meeting planned for Jan. 15.
   Late Monday, the official news agency ADN said that the first
indictments against 30 former top-ranking Communists are expected
next month, with more investigations being wrapped up in March and
April.
   East Germany has been caught up in a near-frenzy aimed at
rooting out corruption and abuse of power under Honecker's
leadership.
   ADN said it could not predict when charges could be expected
against Honecker, who also is the target of a criminal probe.
   ADN said Honecker was undergoing ``stationary medical care,'' a
term used to indicate hospitalization. It did not say where the
77-year-old Honecker was being treated.

   A Palestinian woman was stabbed to death in the
occupied Gaza Strip, and slogans that appeared on walls today
accused her of collaborating with Israel.
   Shops throughout the occupied territories were closed by a
strike today to mark the start of the 26th month of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule.
   A senior aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel needs
stronger U.S. assurances that the Palestine Liberation Organization
will not be a partner in proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, director-general of the prime minister's
office, also rejected the State Department's call on Israel to
rescind its ban on travel abroad by nine pro-PLO activists from the
occupied territories, including some believed involved in
behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts.
   He said there was ``no connection'' between the travel bans and
the peace process and said the Palestinians were restricted because
they violated security regulations, which he did not specify.
   Arab reports said masked Palestinians entered the home of Zifra
Abu Libda, 36, late Monday and stabbed her repeatedly. They said
slogans today on walls in her southern Gaza town of Rafah accused
her of collaboration.
   The army confirmed the death.
   Her death raised to 167 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the uprising. Most have been killed by pro-PLO or
Moslem fundamentalist factions for collaboration or involvement in
drugs or prostitution.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, 646 Palestinians have
been killed by Israelis, and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.
   At a government briefing, Ben-Aharon said Israel is ``somewhat
uneasy that there is reticence on the part of the United States to
say clearly that the PLO will not be involved'' in the peace
process.
   Ben-Aharon said that until such U.S. assurances were given,
there was no point in holding a meeting between U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and the foreign ministers of Egypt and
Israel.
   The meeting was to have been the next step in U.S. peacemaking
efforts in the Middle East and was to clear the way for preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian talks, possibly in Cairo.
   Israel rejects all contact with the PLO, saying it is a terror
organization.
   Also today, the army said schools for about 320,000 Arab
children would open in the West Bank starting Wednesday. Elementary
and secondary schools will open Sunday for about 180,000 students
in the Gaza Strip, officials said.
   The schools had been closed for a holiday break, and the army
resisted efforts by the United Nations and other groups to resume
classes earlier to make up for time lost last year during
army-mandated closures.
   The army closed elementary schools and high schools in the West
Bank for much of the 1988-89 school year, contending they were
organizing points for the uprising.

   President Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia
today fired his entire Cabinet, but officials said he was expected
to name an interim government soon.
   Somalia's Ministry of Information confirmed the dismissals and
the anticipated naming of a new Cabinet in a telex message to The
Associated Press office in Nairobi. It provided no details and did
not say how many seats there are in the Cabinet.
   Siad Barre, who seized power in a 1969 coup, in recent years has
ruled a deteriorating nation beset by tribal rebellions in the
north and south, clan warfare, and a bankrupt economy.
   The president, who is said to be in his 80s, has tried to defuse
the growing opposition to his regime by appointing a commission to
rewrite the constitution to permit multiparty elections this year.
Critics say it is too little too late.
   Siad Barre's government also has been heavily criticized for
alleged human rights abuses, which have prompted Western donors to
severely slash aid to the Horn of Africa nation.

   The American Civil Liberties Union, a longtime
critic of random sweeps for guns in Detroit schools, now is pushing
for locker searches when there is reason to believe a student has a
weapon.
   The local ACLU planned to present its 13-point proposal on
stepped-up security tonight to the Detroit school board.
   ``These aren't all original ideas, but together they constitute
a comprehensive approach that can result in less violence and a
better learning atmosphere,'' said Leonard L. Grossman, president
of the ACLU's metropolitan Detroit branch.
   ``The ACLU has frequently been looked upon as a bunch of
naysayers. We want to be part of the solution as well as raising
legitimate constitutional issues.''
   Howard Simon, ACLU executive director for Michigan, said
endorsing locker searches to confiscate weapons does not contradict
the group's stand against random weapons sweeps with metal
detectors, a tactic he said doesn't work.
   Thirty-one guns were confiscated from students between Aug. 28
and Nov. 30, compared with 24 for the same period last year,
according to district figures.
   Simon said the district should intensify individual searches
when school security officers have reasonable suspicion that a
student has a weapon.
   The ACLU proposal was developed by a 42-member task force that
includes Wayne County Prosecutor John D. O'Hair, several judges,
educators and civic and social service leaders.
   The proposal also calls for classroom lectures on government by
legal experts, internships in law offices, alternative schools for
students expelled for weapons possession, expansion of a weapons
tip hotline and establishment of a committee of students, teachers,
administrators, parents and community leaders to review
disciplinary codes.
   School board President Lawrence C. Patrick Jr. said that current
efforts to strengthen discipline are working but that he welcomed
the ACLU report.

   Dawn Steel, who attained the highest
executive post of any woman in Hollywood history, has resigned as
president of Columbia Pictures, saying her creative instincts were
underused.
   The departure of Ms. Steel, 43, had been widely anticipated
since Sony Corp. bought the studio in September and brought in
Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the producers of ``Rain Man'' and
``Batman,'' to run it.
   Ms. Steel, who succeeded David Puttnam in 1987, said Monday that
she will remain as a Columbia consultant for several months but is
looking forward to leaving a job she called ``a gilded cage.''
   ``As I seemed to go higher up in the hierarchy, it became more
administrative for me and I began to feel like I was selling used
cars. It wasn't a creative job for me anymore, which it had been up
until that point,'' she said.
   Ms. Steel had been cut out of decision-making as Guber and
Peters assembled their own executive team.
   Jeff Sagansky, president of Columbia's sister studio, Tri-Star
Pictures, left in December to head the entertainment division of
CBS.
   Columbia and Tri-Star had a 16 percent share of the box office
last year, or third place, up from seventh in 1988 when the studios
combined for 9.3 percent of domestic movie tickets sold. The 1989
mark was set with 42 films, while box-office champion Warner Bros.
had 30 films and runner-up Universal had 19.

<TEXT>
   Communist and opposition leaders today
met with members of the Slavic majority and Turkish minority to try
to end ethnic strife that has swept Bulgaria.
   Well-informed diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they heard today's closed-door session was ``very heated.''
The talks are aimed at settling a dispute that arose over the
government's restoration of minority rights to ethnic Turks. They
are expected to last through the week.
   Demonstrations against the Dec. 29 decision to restore minority
rights erupted Thursday and spread to at least eight cities,
including Sofia and Bulgafin's second-largest city, Plovdiv. Slav
nationalists rallying in Sofia shouted down government leaders
Sunday and demanded they resign.
   With the decision, the new Bulgarian leadership sought to end a
policy forcing the assimilation of mostly Moslem ethnic Turks into
Bulgarian culture. The program changed Turkish names into Bulgarian
names and denied Turks the right to practice their customs and
religion.
   Party chief and State Council President Petar Mladenov, who
replaced ousted leader Todor Zhivkov on Nov. 10, defended the Dec.
29 decision during a meeting Monday with Slav nationalists.
   According to the BTA news agency, Mladenov told leaders of the
Council for the Defense of National Interests that the forced
assimilation moves ``affecting the Moslem population were very
grave errors.''
   Mladenov reportedly told the meeting that ``one result of these
errors has been Bulgaria's complete international isolation.''
   The only way to correct these errors and re-establish Bulgaria's
international prestige is ``to restore the constitutional rights of
all citizens,'' he said.
   Leaders of the government, independent labor movements, ethnic
Turks and the Turkish government have hinted that the nationalist
unrest that started last week was likely fueled by local
hard-liners still loyal to Zhivkov.
   Krasniu Petkov, a senior trade union official, had called for
all demonstrations and strikes to cease ``during this week of
dialogue,'' BTA reported.
   Petkov said all participants in the talks Monday at the National
Assembly supported the call.
   The nationalists have expressed fear that their own culture will
be overshadowed by the culture of the Turks, whose birthrate is
growing while that of the Slavs is declining.
   About 1.5 million ethnic Turks live in the nation of 9 million.
   Some of the 320,000 ethnic Turks who streamed from Bulgaria to
Turkey last summer have returned, but most appear to be watching
and waiting to see if Bulgaria's new reform-minded Communist
leaders make good on their promise to end the forced assimilation.

   Gay activists demanding repeal of sodomy laws set
up inflatable dolls on a brass bed and blocked traffic outside the
Capitol on the opening day of the 1990 Legislature. Fifty-nine
people were arrested.
   Four lesbian couples who flung themselves onto the street and
began  ...  amid traffic were among those arrested Monday in the
protest against Georgia's 156-year-old sodomy statute.
   About 50 pickets organized by the Texas-based American Family
Association held a quiet counterdemonstration across the street.
   ``Lesbian and gay activists across this country will go to
courthouses, statehouses and jailhouses to change the existing
order,'' Sue Hyde of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in
Washington told about 300 protesters.
   Ms. Hyde said activists would focus on seven states that ``go
out of their way to criminalize gay and lesbian sex'' _ Arkansas,
Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas.
   ``We make a particular demand today that the seven states ...
not only repeal these odious statutes, but also apologize to us for
the unpardonable offense of defining us as a sexually criminal
class of citizens,'' she said.
   The protesters also set up a brass bed with male and female
inflatable dolls simulating one of the heterosexul and homosexual
acts forbidden by Georgia law.
   Organizers of the protest backed a repeal bill co-sponsored by a
state representative, Cynthia McKinney, who is in a legislative
dispute with her father over the issue.
   State Rep. Billy McKinney introduced a bill Monday that would
repeal the statute only as it  ...  bill ``violates family values.''
   Father and daughter are Atlanta Democrats.
   Georgia's sodomy law was upheld in 1986 by the U.S. Supreme
Court after being challenged by a gay Atlanta man arrested for
having sex in his home.
   In September, a state judge ruled that the law cannot be applied
to consenting married adults. Prosecutors did not appeal that
decision.

   Space shuttle Columbia opened a new
decade of spaceflight today as it rocketed into orbit on a daring
10-day mission to chase down and bring back a satellite as big as a
bus before it falls to Earth.
   The 115-ton winged spaceship lifted off with a crew of five at
7:35 a.m., riding a 700-foot column of flame out over the Atlantic
on the start of the second-longest shuttle flight yet.
   Skies were partly cloudy as tens of thousands watched the start
just after dawn of the 33rd shuttle mission, during which the
astronauts will put a Navy communications satellite in$oorbit on
Wednesday and retrieve an 11-ton orbiting science laboratory on
Friday.
   ``I don't think I've ever seenpacleaner countdown and launch,''
said Richard Truly, administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. ``What a marvelous way to start the 1990s.''
   The mission is the first of 10 planned in 1990 as NASA continues
its recovery from the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauty ao r'years ago this month.
   Once in orbit, the astronauts set up their computers for flight,
unpacked equipment, remov  Liftoff was three weeks behind schedule, delayed
last month by
launch pad problems and on Monday by low-lying clouds. The launch
was timed to put Columbia on the orbital path followed by the
satellite the astronauts are tracking.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee will guide
the shuttle throug@   series of intricate maneuvers to close in on
their quarry, which has been orbiting the Earth nearly six years.
   The satellite, the Lmf Duration Exposure Facility, is the size
of a small school bus and is packed wA4wP57 experiments containing
a wealth of scientiFi and technological information from its long
exposure to space.
   Once the satellite is caught, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar
will reach out with the shuttle's 50-foot arm to snare the
21,400-pound package, which is 30 feet long and 14 feet in
diameter, and stow it in the shuttle's cargo bay.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' Brandenstein
said recently. ``But NASA has plenty experience doing this type of
rendezvous, and Jim and I have practiced it to perfection in the
simulator.''
   The satellite is 202 miles up, buv@`tmospheric drag has been
pulling it to Earth about half a mile each day. If the satellite
can't be retrieved, it will fall into the atmosphere and burn up
about March 9, its experiments lost forever.
   Once the satellite is captured, Brandenstein, Wetherbee, Dunbar
and mission specialists Marghn Ivins and David Low will concentratq
on experiments, with emphasis on materials processing and how the
body adapts to weightlessness.
   The mission is to be 10 hours shorter than the ninth shuttle
flight, in 1983, and is a stepping stone for even longer ones.
Columbia is being modified to stay aloft 16 days, starting with a
1993 fligHtV
   Scientists are eager to examine LDEF to learn how various
materials and systems withstood the long stay in orbit _
information that will help in designing a permanent space station
and the ``Star Wars'' defense system.
   ``LDEF is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology
information,'' said William Kinard, chief scientist for the project.
   Scientists may reap a big bonus because the satellite has been
in space five years longer than intended. The satellite was to have
been retrieved 10 months after a shuttle put it into orbit in 1984.
But scheduling problems and the 1986 Challenger disaster delayed
the retrieval.
   The satellite cAr
ies experiments on materials, propulsion,
electronics, optics and other areas. They represent more than 200
investigators, 33 companies, 21 universities, 7 NASA centers and
several foreign countries.
   On board are 12.5 million tomato seeds that will be distributed
to students from fifth grade through university level for research
into such things as germination rates and genetic changes.

<HEAD>Army Corps of Engineers Closes Monongahela</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army Corps of Engineers today closed 23.8
miles of the Monongahela River for about 10 days to lower the water
and remove one of at least 61 barges torn from their moorings by
rushing ice New Year's Day.
   The closure will mean about 25 vessels a day carrying at least
35,000 tons of coal and gravel will be delayed or forced to find
another route, said corps spokeswoman Nancy Mullen.
   Crews on Monday began draining 17 feet of water from the river
between Brownsville and Greensboro, upstream from Pittsburgh, said
corps spokesman John Reed. Once the river is low enough, workers
will try to free a sunken barge wedged under a floodgate at the
Maxwell Locks and Dam near Brownsville.
   ``It's going to look more like a creek than a river. A good size
creek,'' Reed said Monday.
   The Coast Guard on Monday continued its investigation into the
runaway barges. Heavy rain and melting snow had raised the level of
the river and sent chunks of ice rushing downriver. One barge
leaked as much as 10,000 gallons of gasoline.
   As of Monday morning, 31 submerged or partially submerged barges
were close to the upstream side of the Maxwell Dam and two others
were downstream, Mullen said.
   Salvage workers hired by the companies whose barges broke free
will work to remove the remaining barges from the river, Reed said.
   Water companies in the affected stretch of river have been
warned of the pending low-water levels so they can store water and
attach flexible hoses to their intake pipes that will reach the
water.
   Reed said it is unlikely any water companies will run dry and
that he is not aware of any conservation measures imposed on
customers.
   The corps expects to have a clear channel by next Monday and
will allow the water level to rise, probably reopening the river
Jan. 19, Reed said.
   The river was reopened early Thursday after being closed by the
Coast Guard for four days shortly after the breakaway.

   A man who stopped to help a stranded motorist
says he was instead sprayed with acid that left an eye swollen
shut, turned his face gray and burned holes in his clothes.
   ``I won't stop to help anymore. It's a sad state of affairs that
there are these bizarre people out there,'' said Gary P. Sexton,
who believes the incident was a set-up rather than a reaction from
a frightened driver.
   Sexton, 45, a Boeing Co. plumber, was hospitalized at Harborview
Medical Center and was to meet with a plastic surgeon to see
whether he'll need skin grafts.
   Sexton said he was driving home alone from work Saturday night
when he spotted a utility vehicle with its hood up and emergency
flashers on. Sexton rolled down his window and coasted alongside
the other driver's window.
   ``I looked right at him and all of a sudden the hose nozzle came
up and right out the window, like a fire extinguisher. I tilted my
head down and away when he hit me,'' Sexton said Monday.
   ``It hit two-thirds of the left side of my face; the top of my
head is all shot, turned a different color, gray, now,'' he said.
Part of his left eye was burned but will probably heal, he said.
   ``It just disintegrated the coat I had on my back, just melted
it. It just destroyed the inside of my truck, the dashboard and all
the plastic in the seat,'' Sexton said.
   Police said they had no suspect and had not determined what was
sprayed. Sexton said it smelled like battery acid.
   ``The police officer who came to help told me that nowadays you
should never stop to help out like that,'' said Sexton's
girlfriend, Pam Young. ``Just go by and go to a phone booth and
phone 911.''

<HEAD>Mobutu Postpones Angolan Peace Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has
postponed an eight-nation African summit scheduled to discuss
attempts at ending Angola's 15-year-old civil war, the Angolan
state news agency reported today.
   The ANGOP report said Zambian leader Kenneth Kaunda was
attempting to set a new date for the summit, which was scheduled
Wednesday in Luanda, Angola's capital.
   Government officials in Zaire earlier said Mobutu felt more time
was needed after Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
presented an eight-point plan for ending hostilities.
   Mobutu, who had proposed cease-fire procedures and offered to
serve as a mediator for peace, postponed the summit in a message
sent to dos Santos, ANGOP reported.
   In a New Year's Day speech, dos Santos said Mobutu's peace plan
omitted principals agreed to at a June meeting between the Angolan
leader and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi.
   Dos Santos said Mobutu's proposed measures to verify a
cease-fire were unsuited to guerrilla war conditions and said the
Zairean leader's role as mediator in the Angolan conflict must be
strictly defined.
   Dos Santos offered a plan calling for integration of rebel
forces into Angola's army and recognition of the legitimacy of the
present government, but suggested free elections could be held in
the one-party Marxist state within five years.
   In a later interview, dos Santos said that although he foresaw
individuals being allowed to run against government candidates in
the election, he opposed multi-party balloting.
   Rebels of the U.S.-backed National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola rejected dos Santos' proposal in a statement
distributed in Lisbon on Monday.
   The rebel statement called for an immediate cease-fire based on
Mobutu's proposals and direct negotiations with the government
leading to free, multi-party elections.
   The meeting with the presidents of Angola, Congo, Gabon,
Mozambique, Sao Tome e Principe, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe was
first planned for December. Its second postponement came amid
reports of heavy fighting in south-east Angola.
   The U.S. State Department expressed concern Monday at a military
offensive by Angolan forces against rebel strongholds in the
southeast.
   The Soviet ambassador in Luanda, Vladimir Kazimirov, denied
reports of Soviet advisers in the combat zone, ANGOP reported today.
   Angola is expected to be featured strongly in talks scheduled
Wednesday in Washington between President Bush and Portuguese Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. Portugal is the former colonial power
in Angola and maintains close links with Luanda. The ANGOP report
was monitored in Lisbon.
   The rebels have been fighting to share power since the Marxist
government gained control in Luanda after independence in 1975.

   Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, had record revenues of $1.27 billion last fiscal year,
the quasi-government corporation reported.
   That income covered 72 percent of costs for the railroad
passenger operation, up from 69 percent a year earlier and the
highest revenue-to-cost ratio in the agency's history, Amtrak said
Monday.
   As resently as 1981, Amtrak revenues covered less than half of
its costs. The difference between costs and revenues is made up by
federal appropriations.
   The revenues of $1.27 billion were up from $1.1 billion a year
earlier, Amtrak reported.
   The total number of passengers carried was down slightly, from
21.5 million to 21.4 million. But passenger miles, defined as
carrying one passenger one mile, rose from 5.7 billion in 1988 to
5.9 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Part of Dallas Ordinance Against Sexually
Oriented Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today threw out part of a
Dallas ordinance aimed at cracking down on X-rated moviehouses and
other sexually oriented businesses.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the city's licensing ordinance
violates the Constitution's free-speech guarantees by creating a
``prior restraint.''
   Another part of the ordinance, however, was upheld and some
parts were not ruled on by the justices. The court said the city
may require licensing for motels that rent rooms for fewer than 10
hours.
   The invalidated licensing provisions required sexually oriented
businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police chief, who
had broad discretion to deny one.
   Under the ordinance, the chief did not have to issue a license
until a sexually oriented business had its premises approved by the
health department, fire department and building officials.
   Writing the court's main opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said, ``Where the licensor has unlimited time within which to issue
a license, the risk of arbitrary suppression is as great as the
provision of unbridled discretion.''
   ``A scheme that fails to set reasonable time limits on the
decisonmaker,'' she said, ``creates the risk of indefinitely
suppressing permissible speech.''
   O'Connor said some businesses regulated by the licensing
ordinance _ such as escort agencies and sexual encounter groups _
are not protected by the free-speech protections of the
Constitution's First Amendment. But she added, ``It largely targets
businesses purveying sexually explicit speech which the city
concedes ... are protected.''
   The court's vote was splintered, with different alignments on
each part of the ordinance. On the licensing requirement, O'Connor
was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, John Paul Stevens,
William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White
and Antonin Scalia voted to uphold the licensing requirement.
   The court upheld the motel-licensing part of the ordinance, and
said none of the ordinance's challengers had the proper legal
standing to attack a provision barring licenses for people who
reside with someone who had such a license revoked or denied.
   The justices also said the challengers lacked the standing to
attack provisions requiring suspensions of licenses for people
convicted of certain crimes.
   The ordinance also imposes strict zoning regulations on sexually
oriented businesses, but the court previously turned away
challenges to those regulations.
   Today, the justices told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
to decide whether the invalidated licensing provisions of the
ordinance can be separated from the remaining regulations _ or
whether the entire ordinance must be ruled unenforceable because of
those licensing provisions.
   The case is FW/PBS vs. Dallas, 88-2012.

<HEAD>`Hash Bash' Town May Boost Marijuana Fine From $5 to $25</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marijuana use might get more risky this
spring in this university city known for its annual Hash Bash _
voters are being asked to decide whether to raise the $5 fine for
possession or sale to $25.
   The city's 1974 marijuana law, in addition to setting the $5
fine, requires that city police ticket rather than arrest pot
offenders.
   City Council voted 9-2 Monday to put the stiffer fine on the
April 2 ballot.
   Mayor Jerry Jernigan has been pushing against the existing law
since last year. Residents defeated a proposed repeal of the $5 pot
law in 1983 by a vote of 13,977 to 8,660.
   A Hash Bash rally for legalization of marijuana is held every
April 1 on the University of Michigan campus. In 1989, the 19th
rally drew about 1,000 high school and college students. Fifteen
people were ticketed for possession.
   Many in the gallery at the Council meeting spoke against
toughening the ordinance.
   ``Affordable housing, health care and other issues await your
serious attention. Council fights its theatrical drug war while
drug treatment goes unfunded,'' former Councilman Jeff Upton said.
   City resident Jan Schnell urged approval. ``Across the nation,
this city is known for real lenient penalties for pot,'' he said.
``You council members need to know Ann Arbor is a laughingstock
because of $5 pot.''
   Police records show that in the past 2{ years, 308 tickets were
written under the $5 marijuana law.

   Bud the hamster survived a night in the
family freezer to the delight of his 6-year-old owner.
   ``I thought he would go up to heaven, and my mom would buy me a
new one,'' Bradley Snoddy said Friday.
   Bradley's mother, Mary Ann Snoddy, said she thought Bud, who was
curled up in a corner of his cage, was dying of old age. Bud was 4,
far beyond the 1{ to 2 years hamsters usually live.
   She said she called a pet store and was advised to put the
animal out of its misery by putting it in the freezer, where it
would ``fall asleep and not wake up.'' She wrapped Bud in a cloth
and put him in a paper bag in the freezer.
   ``We had a very rough night. We were totally devastated,''
Snoddy said. ``My son was in tears all night.''
   But on Thursday morning, Snoddy said, ``I opened the freezer
door, and flop, onto the floor fell the hamster. He sat up on his
hind legs, and looked at me like, `Why did you do this to me?'''
   During the night, Bud had chewed through the bag, dined on an
arctic smorgasbord of bread and hash browns and gained a new lease
on life, Snoddy said. ``He's just fine. Just the regular, normal
hamster that we had before.''
   Veterinarian Stephanie Hazen said the Snoddys got bad advice on
how to put to death a hamster.
   ``You can't kill hamsters by putting them in a freezer,'' she
said. ``They live for days and days.''
   She recommended that people take their dying animals to the
Humane Society to be put to death painlessly.

<HEAD>Jet That Lost Engine Had Lavatory Repair Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Northwest Airlines jet that lost one of
its three engines over Florida last week had a recent history of
maintenance problems with its lavatory, federal aviation officials
said today.
   The lavatory of Northwest Flight 5, a Boeing 727, had been
repaired 10 times since early November, said Dick Stafford, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   An unidentified FAA official told The New York Times, which
disclosed the situation in today's editions, that the number of
repairs was unusual. ``It probably shouldn't have occurred this
many times,'' the source was quoted as saying.
   A Northwest spokesman was not immediately available today for
comment, the company's public affairs office said today. In the
Times account, spokesman Doug Miller disputed the figure, saying
there were only five or six repairs in the last six months.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has yet to rule on the
cause of the accident 35,000 feet in the air, but there are signs
that the blue flushing fluid leaking from a valve in the plane's
lavatory was responsible.
   Officials theorize that the liquid may have frozen at higher
altitudes, broken free and been hurled into the engine of the
Miami-to-Minneapolis flight. The liquid would have caused the
engine to vibrate and break off, they theorize, since the 727
engines are supposed to break free to avoid damaging the frame when
they vibrate badly.
   NTSB field inspector Andrew Alston was in Atlanta today to
examine the engine and the lavatory, Miami regional director George
Prellezo said by telephone.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said today in Washington, ``We
intend to dismantle that lavatory tank what see what the problem is
and talk to the people who repaired it last.''
   Prellezo said the investigation was ``very simple'' and findings
indicate that the problem is limited. ``We don't have a problem
with all the airplanes,'' he said.
   As recently as 1985, engines broke off Boeing 727s in flight,
and in each case the problem was traced to a leaking lavatory. As a
result, the FAA in 1986 ordered airlines to inspect lavatory valves
in 727s every 200 flight hours or replace them with sturdier valves.
   Newer 727s have redesigned valves that are likely to leak, a
Boeing Co. spokesman told the Times.
   Despite the concern with lavatory leaks, the FAA's Stafford said
there were no records to indicate whether the record of repairs on
Flight 5 was unusual.
   Stafford said it was too early to determine whether any fines
might be in order.

   A crematorium has been ordered to pay
nearly $1.9 million to the owners of a next-door auto shop who
couldn't stand the stench.
   ``It's an outrageous, noxious smell that I don't think any
normal person could stand without gagging,'' Larry Hunt, co-owner
of the auto shop in Laguna Beach, said Monday.
   A Superior Court jury voted 11-1 on Friday to award $800,000 for
emotional distress. On Monday, it voted unanimously to award
punitive damages of nearly $1.1 million against McCormick Mortuary
and its operator, Robert McCormick Jr.
   Mortuary employees refused to comment.
   Hunt and co-owner Virginia Hunt alleged that the smell and smoke
from the crematorium plagued them from 1982 on, bothering customers
and workers alike.
   Sometimes employees got so sick from the stench they were forced
to close shop, the Hunts claimed.

<HEAD>Japan's Prime Minister Hails East Europe Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan today
welcomed democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and better East-West
relations but warned of the Soviet Union's continuing military
might.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, welcoming Kaifu on his first visit to
West Germany, urged Japan to lower trade barriers.
   At a luncheon speech in Bonn, Kohl said Japan must ``further
improve perceptibly'' its market access for West German business in
order to boost trade ``to a level commensurate with the high
standard of development of the two economies.''
   Japan in recent years has been embroiled in several trade
disputes with the United States and the European Economic
Community, of which West Germany is the most powerful member.
   In a speech later in West Berlin, Kaifu called the desire for
uniting Germany ``legitimate'' and indicated he would not oppose
such a move.
   Kaifu, on a European tour that will include visits to Hungary
and Poland, promised economic aid to both East European countries
but said they must also help themselves.
   He hailed the opening of the Berlin Wall, for 28 years a symbol
of the Cold War division of Europe, and said he wanted to ``praise
the courage of those in the East who have made this decision.''
   East Germany's Communist rulers opened the wall and borders to
West Germany on Nov. 9.
   The Japanese prime minister cautioned that despite warming
East-West ties, ``the international situation remains opaque and
fluid, and the Soviet Union still is a military superpower.''
   ``Deterrence and balance of power continue to be the
underpinning for world security,'' he said.
   On German unification, Kaifu called for ``a framework of peace
and stability'' so that the ``legitimate aspiration of the German
people to unify the country divided after the war can be realized
amicably through the free exercise of their right to
self-determination.''

Confidential Data</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that colleges
and universities enjoy no special privilege to withhold
confidential data from faculty members who claim they illegally
were denied tenure.
   The court unanimously rejected University of Pennsylvania
arguments that ``academic freedom'' confers a privilege of
confidentiality for peer review records sought by a faculty member
who sued when denied tenure, or a lifetime appointment.
   The controversy had drawn the attention of numerous
universities. The University of Pennyslvania's appeal had been
supported by Princeton, Brown, Stanford, Harvard and Yale. All told
the court that forcing universities to reveal confidential
statements about professors being considered for tenure would
inhibit candor by those doing the evaluating.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said past court
rulings extending constitutional protection for so-called academic
freedom only applied to government attempts to control or direct
the content of speech engaged in by a university.
   The court refused to recognize what Blackmun called ``an
expanded right of academic freedom to protect confidential peer
review materials from disclosure.''
   The decision also rejected arguments by the university's
officials that federal rules of evidence provide such a privilege
of confidentiality.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Threw out part of a Dallas ordinance aimed at cracking down on
X-rated moviehouses and other sexually oriented businesses.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the city's licensing ordinance
violates the Constitution's free-speech guarantees by creating a
``prior restraint.''
   Another part of the ordinance, however, was upheld and some
parts were not ruled on by the justices. The court said the city
may require licensing for motels that rent rooms for fewer than 10
hours.
   _ Said utility companies don't have to pay income tax on
deposits charged customers to insure payment of future bills. In
the process, it handed the Bush administration a $300 million
setback.
   The court unanimously ruled that an Indiana electric utility,
Indianapolis Power and Light Co., does not have to pay taxes when
collecting such deposits.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that more than 150 such
cases involving over $300 million in potential taxes are pending in
lower courts or before the tax agency.
   The tenure case began with a complaint by Rosalie Tung, an
associate professor of management at the University of
Pennsylvania, after she was denied tenure at the university's
Wharton School.
   Ms. Tung filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charging she was the victim of
illegal discrimination against women and people of Asian descent.
   The EEOC subpoenaed the university's confidential peer review
records for Ms. Tung and five male candidates considered for
tenure, but the university refused to provide the documents.
   It said confidentiality is vital to peer review, which in turn
is ``a critical component'' of the school's academic freedom.
   University officials argued in favor of a balancing test,
approved by some federal appeals courts, that would allow the
school to keep the information secret unless it is shown to be
essential to the claim being made by the faculty member who was
denied tenure.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 rejected that
argument, and its ruling was upheld today.
   ``Because we conclude that the EEOC subpoena process does not
infringe any First Amendment right enjoyed by (the university), the
EEOC need not demonstrate any special justification ... as applied
to tenure peer review materials in general or to the subpoena
involved in this case,'' Blackmun wrote.
   The case is University of Pennsylvania vs. EEOC, 88-493.

   Divers searching for the revolver used in the
wounding of Charles Stuart and the killing of his pregnant wife
found a gun today in the river where Stuart's brother said he
dumped it, police said.
   ``It fits the description,'' said police spokesman Larry Gillis.
``Hopefully a major piece of the puzzle has fallen into place.''
   Police had searched for the gun since Charles Stuart, 29,
committed suicide Thursday. Stuart jumped from a Boston Harbor
bridge after his brother Matthew implicated him in the slaying of
Carol Stuart, whose premature baby died 17 days later.
   Investigators were expected to perform ballistics tests to see
if is the murder weapon.
   FBI agent Jack DeCourcy said it is possible to detect
fingerprints on a gun found in salt water, depending on how long it
was submerged, how rusty it was and whether it was found in silt.
   Stuart, who is white, originally told police he and his wife
were shot by a black mugger who forced his way into their car Oct.
23 as they left a childbirth class. Police listening to Stuart's
pleas for help over his car phone found him and his dying wife by
listening to their sirens over the phone.
   Matthew Stuart, 23, told authorities last week that he took Mrs.
Stuart's handbag, which contained personal items and the gun, from
the scene of the shootings and threw the items separately into the
Pines River in Revere.
   Police found the bag Thursday, but the gun had remained a
missing clue in the effort to unravel the baffling and racially
inflammatory case.
   Jay Kakas, co-owner of the fur store where Charles Stuart
worked, told police a revolver was stolen from the shop's safe, a
representative of the store, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Monday. Investigators refused to comment on that report and on
rumors of insurance or a romantic relationship as motives.
   Matthew Stuart also has refused to comment, but his attorney,
John J. Perenyi, said his client told family members and friends
about the plot.
   ``There wasn't a lot of support in the family for going to
authorities,'' Perenyi said.
   A brother of Mrs. Stuart said he was appalled that the Stuart
family might have joined his family in grieving while keeping
secret their knowledge of a murder scheme.
   ``Can you believe that they came to our house to comfort my
parents? That is just mind boggling, that they could sit with us,
or allow us to visit Chuck,'' Carl DiMaiti, Carol Stuart's brother,
told WLVI-TV.
   DiMaiti said his family believed Charles was a victim until the
shocking revelations about the case that followed his suicide.
   ``It was such a convincing story and he was such a pitiful
victim,'' DiMaiti said. ``He had lost his wife, he had lost his
child. They seemed to have a perfect relationship,'' DiMaiti said.
   ``You know, for us to cry over Chuck, to pray for Chuck's
recovery, knowing that Chuck was responsible for what happened to
Carol. It's just unbelievable.''
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, questioned another brother of Charles
Stuart on Monday, as they continued to investigate who else knew
about the killing.
   Michael Stuart met with investigators from the district
attorney's office. His lawyer, Richard Clayman, declined to discuss
the details of the questions, but he added that his client broke no
law.
   Clayman said he could not discuss what Michael Stuart told him,
but he noted: ``I think it's reasonable to conclude there was a
terrible family dilemma that existed.''
   Legal scholars say that under state law, people who might have
suspected Charles Stuart as the killer had no legal obligation to
report that to police.
   In Massachusetts, ``persons are criminally culpable for what
they do, for their acts, not for what they know,'' said Frank
Chubert, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
   Prosecutors, citing a continuing grand jury investigation,
declined to say whether more charges will be brought.
   Members of the black community, who have denounced what they say
was a racist investigation into the case, met to discuss a proposed
civilian panel to evaluate police conduct.
   During the investigation, police searched scores of black
residences and identified at least two black suspects.
   Meanwhile, Stuart's casket has been placed in the ground at
Woodlawn Cemetery in suburban Everett, where a memorial service was
held for him Saturday.
   The grave, covered with sheets of plywood and a canvas
tarpaulin, was marked only with a stick, plot No. 1443 written on
it.
   Several plastic pots, holding wilted red roses and white
carnations, lay on their sides.

   An outlawed Protestant
extremist group claimed responsibility for murdering a taxi driver,
saying it was in retaliation for a murder by the Irish Republican
Army.
   The Protestant Action Force said it killed Martin Byrne, 38,
according to a report Monday by Press Association, Britain's
domestic news agency. Byrne's body was found in his car near a
highway Sunday.
   The group said the killing was in retaliation for the death of
Harry Dicky, a Protestant taxi driver who was killed by an IRA bomb
Jan. 2. The IRA claimed Dicky was involved in paramilitary
activities.
   The Protestant Action Force said it was also retaliating for the
shooting death of Robert Metcalfe, 40, at his home in October.
   Nearly 2,800 people have died in two decades of sectarian
fighting in Northern Ireland, and 1,900 of them have been civilians.
   The IRA, which is waging a guerrilla campaign to end British
rule in Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Republic
of Ireland, has been responsible for about half of the deaths,
according to official figures.
   Protestant paramilitaries have been responsible for about
one-fourth of the deaths, while about 12 percent of the deaths were
attributed to the security forces.
   The Protestant Action Force is a cover name used by the Ulster
Volunteer Force, an illegal organization that emerged in the 1960s.

   Lawyers clashed before the Supreme Court today
on whether public high school officials should have broad authority
to exclude Bible-reading and other religious clubs from school
facilities.
   Allen E. Daubman, a lawyer for an Omaha, Neb., school system,
asked the court to limit the scope of a 1984 federal law requiring
a public high school to permit meetings of student religious groups
when it sanctions such other activities as chess and scuba diving
clubs.
   A broad interpretation of the law ``stifles the efforts of
educators to structure a program that is relevant and provides
benefits to the students,'' Daubman said.
   But Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, the Bush
administration's chief courtroom lawyer, said Daubman's position
undermines the 1984 Equal Access Act.
   Congress' ``primary thrust was to protect religious liberty,''
Starr said. ``It's quite clear the purpose of the act was to
eliminate discrimination against religious groups.''
   Jay Alan Sekulow, representing a group of students who tried to
form a Bible-reading club at Westside High School in Omaha, agreed.
   ``The act would become a nullity by administrative fiat'' if the
Omaha school officials prevail, Sekulow said.
   The court is expected to issue a ruling by July in the case.
Hanging in the balance, some school groups say, is whether religion
and prayer will return to public schools.
   The justices challenged both sides to give a clearer explanation
of when the federal law applies to religious clubs.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said Daubman seemed to be
arguing for total discretion for school administrators.
   He said the lawyer's position ``allows any school district to
totally avoid the act.''
   But Starr, in a legal brief submitted to the court before
today's arguments, said equal access for religious clubs does not
violate the separation of church and state mandated by the
Constitution's Establishment Clause.
   ``Exclusion of religion, and the message it conveys, would
iitself contravene the Establishment Clause, by sending the clear
message that the state favors irreligion,'' Starr said.
   School officials barred the Bible study group despite the 1984
Equal Access Act that says public high schools accepting federal
aid must not discriminate against groups based on ``the religious,
political, philosophical or other content of the speech at such
meetings.''
   The act requires access for religious clubs if other
``non-curriculum-related student groups'' are allowed to meet.
   Numerous religious, educational and civic organizations have
lined up on opposing sides.
   The National School Boards Association, for example, said the
aim of the 1984 law is ``to bring religion and prayer back to the
public schools.'' The association opposes the statute as
unconstitutional.
   But the Campus Crusade for Christ said ``a voluntary student
club in which ideas with religious content and significance will be
spoken'' should not be discriminated against by school officials.
   Students at Westside High sought in 1985 to organize a Christian
Bible study club. Officials refused to approve it and suggested the
students meet instead at a church next door.
   The student group was led by Bridget Mergens, now married and
the mother of a 13-month-old girl. Mrs. Mergens Mayhew planned to
be in court today to hear arguments in the case she triggered.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year overruled a
federal judge and said the club must be allowed to meet on school
premises.
   The appeals court noted the high school has approved some 30
other extracurricular organizations for such activities as chess,
scuba diving and community service.
   The clubs meet on school grounds after class hours with a
faculty member helping supervise.
   The Supreme Court, which banned organized prayer in public
schools in 1962 and 1963 rulings, said in 1981 that state-run
universities cannot ban student groups from using campus facilities
for religious worship and study.
   The justices have never decided whether the same rule should
apply to public high schools.
   The 8th Circuit Court rejected the idea that high school
students, because they are more impressionable than college
students, should be given more protection from student religious
groups that may appear to be sanctioned by school authorities.
   The appeals court said Congress ``considered the difference in
the maturity level of secondary students and university students
before passing the Equal Access Act. We accept Congress'
fact-finding.''
   The case is Westside Community Schools vs. Mergens, 88-1597.

   Mexico's inflation rate was 19.7 percent last

   Thus, Mexico ended the year meeting its goal of keeping
inflation at 18 percent to 20 percent, the government said in a

159.2 percent in 1987.
   Although the government recently renewed a Feb. 29, 1988
wage-price freeze with business and labor leaders, there are
concerns that inflation could again rise after the freeze expires
later this year.
   Protests are common by workers who complain that wage increases

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court handed the Bush
administration a $300 million setback today, saying utility
companies don't have to pay income tax on deposits charged
customers to insure payment of future bills.
   The court unanimously ruled that an Indiana electric utility,
Indianapolis Power and Light Co., does not have to pay taxes when
collecting such deposits.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that more than 150 such
cases involving over $300 million in potential taxes are pending in
lower courts or before the tax agency.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the
deposits do not amount to advance payments for electric service,
and therefore are not income for tax purposes.
   Although Indiana Power and Light does receive some economic
benefit from the deposits, he said, ``IPL's right to retain the
money is contingent upon events outside its control.''
   ``That the utility's customers, when they qualify for refunds of
deposits, frequently choose to apply those refunds to future bills
rather than taking repayment in cash does not mean that any
customer has made an unspoken commitment to do so,'' Blackmun said.
   The electric company's policy, as amended in 1976, requires some
customers to deposit up to twice their estimated monthly bills for
electricity.
   The company requires the deposits from new customers whose
creditworthiness was in doubt and existing customers with a record
of late payment of their bills.
   The utility pays 6 percent annual interest on the deposits to
customers if it holds the money for at least a year. A deposit is
refunded if the customer meets a credit test or if the customer's
bill is paid on time for nine straight months or for 10 out of 12
months.
   The U.S. Tax Court and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the company need not pay taxes on the deposits, and
today's decision upheld those rulings.
   Justice Department lawyers had argued that the 7th Circuit court
was wrong, and noted that another federal appeals court, the 11th
Circuit court, had ruled the opposite way. Today's decision
resolves that conflict in favor of the utility companies.
   ``A deposit to secure the payment of future income is
essentially indistinguishable from an advance payment for future
goods or services, and therefore is taxable as income upon
receipt,'' the Justice Department argued.
   The case is Commissioner, IRS vs. Indiana Power and Light,
88-1319.

   Former senior Communist officials
used to fly by helicopter to their favorite hunting grounds, where
they shot deer from the comfort of their limousines, the state news
agency CTK reported Tuesday.
   Prominent guests in government hunting grounds, often known as
environmental reserves, included Cuban leader Fidel Castro and the
late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   Former Foreign Minister Bohuslav Chnoupek, former Parliament
Chairman Alois Indra, ex-chief Ideologist Jan Fojtik and former
Interior Minister Jaromir Obzina were among those who, together
with their entourage, ``managed to kill 2,000 pheasants and hares
per day,'' CTK said.
   Former Premier Lubomir Strougal also was among the hunting
devotees, as was veteran Communist hard-liner Vasil Bilak, who
liked to hunt in his home region of Slovakia, CTK reported.
   The news agency quoted unidentifed Hunters' Association
officials as saying that if Westerners has been allowed to hunt,
instead of the Communist elite, the country could have gotten
hundreds of thousands of dollars in hard currency.
   The top officials were said to have flown by helicopter to the
hunting grounds and sometimes shot animals while seated in their
limousines with the windows rolled down, CTK said.
   CTK reported that Castro, hunting in the Slovak Tatra mountains,
``managed to kill two chamoix, whose killing is illegal all year
around.''
   ``Brezhnev used to enjoy looking at dying animals,'' the
Hunters' Association sources were said to have told CTK. ``During
one presidential hunt at Lany (west of Prague) Brezhnev made a film
recording of the last moments of a dying deer.''
   ``We have learned they did nothing to respect the traditions and
ethics of hunting. They shot at animals even from windows of their
cars,'' the report said.
   Other former Communist leaders in Eastern Europe known to have
enjoyed hunting in their own countries include the late Janos Kadar
of Hungary and ousted leaders Erich Honecker of East Germany and
Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria.

   E. Leland Webber, president emeritus of the Field
Museum of Natural History, has died of cancer at the age of 69.
   Webber died Sunday at Evanston Hospital.
   ``I have never worked with anybody I enjoyed more,'' said
Willard Boyd, who succeeded Webber as president of the museum in
1981. ``He was so positive about doing things in new ways. He was
not bound by the past.''
   Webber went to work for the Field Museum in 1950, and was named
director and later president in the early 1960s.
   Under his leadership, the museum renovated its Northwest Coast
Indian, Eskimo and jade collections and built its popular Pawnee
earthen lodge and ``Place for Wonder,'' a hands-on exhibit for
children.
   He began a special traveling exhibit program, which brought in
shows including ``The Treasures of Tutankhamen'' and ``The Great
Bronze Age of China.''
   In 1979, then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat awarded Webber his
country's Order of the Republic.
   ``His primary accomplishment was to put the museum into the
public domain, both in terms of programming and financing,'' Boyd
said.
   After retiring, Webber became chairman of the Field Foundation
of Illinois Inc., a philanthropic organization that aids
institutions in health, welfare, education and cultural affairs.
   Webber is survived by his wife, Joan, two sons, a daughter and a
granddaughter.
   A memorial service was set for Friday in Kenilworth.

   Bomb squad officers blew up a smoking
parcel delivered to a city building today, finding only a jar of
peanuts, a bottle of after shave and matches that had accidentally
ignited, authorities said.
   ``Apparently, due to friction they had rubbed together and some
of the matches had ignited in the box and that had resulted in the
smoke and the sulfur smell,'' county spokesman Mark Kurea said.
   Last month, a white federal judge in Alabama and a black lawyer
in Georgia who worked for the NAACP were killed by mail bombs. A
group calling itself Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System claimed responsibility and threatened to assassinate two
more NAACP officials.
   Kruea said he knew of no threats against any county agencies but
added: ``We're pleased that we took the precautions that we did
given the circumstances and the history of actual bombing
incidents.''
   The box had been taken outside the Spartanburg County
administration building and about 30 people were evacuated after
smoke and a sulfur smell were discovered coming from the parcel,
authorities said.
   The state fire marshal's arson squad blew it up. Inside were
several boxes of wooden matches and other items, authorities said.
   The box was addressed to an inmate at the non-existent
Spartanburg County Prison and delivered by mail truck, said Kruea,
who believed the package was meant for one of the three state
prisons in the county.
   The building houses the sheriff's department, postal service,
police and fire departments and other offices.

<HEAD>South's Share of Blacks Reverses Century-Long Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than a century the
share of blacks living in the South is increasing, the Census
Bureau reported Tuesday.
   The proportion of blacks living in the South grew from 52.2
percent in 1980 to 55.9 percent in 1988, reversing a decline that
had been under way for more than 100 years.
   While the new census study did not investigate the reasons for
this reversal, two factors are likely involved, according to census
statistician Claudette Bennett.
   One is that fewer blacks are leaving the South than in the past,
while the second is movement of blacks back into the region both in
search of jobs and as part of the general movement of all types of
Americans into the Sun Belt states.
   In recent years the employment growth that has taken place in
the country has occurred disproportionately in the South, noted
William P. O'Hare, director of policy studies at the private
Population Reference Bureau.
   Blacks had traditionally been drawn out of the South by jobs in
heavy industry in the North, but most had maintained family and
kinship ties in the Southern states, he commented. Such ties,
explained O'Hare, make it easier to return south.
   However, the current trend is not exactly a return flow, O'Hare
said in a telephone interview.
   Historically, blacks moved out of the rural South to urban
North. The flow now is to urban areas in the South, not back to
people's rural roots, he said.
   While the share of blacks in the South grew by 3.7 percentage
points between 1980 and 1988, the region with the largest loss was
the Northeast, slipping from 18.6 percent to 16.5 percent of blacks.
   The Midwest dropped from 20.5 percent to 19.1 percent of blacks
over the period, while the West was nearly unchanged, sliding from
8.6 percent to 8.5 percent.
   The 1880 national census found 90.4 percent of blacks living in
the South, and a century ago in 1890 that had slipped only slightly
to 90.3 percent, according to calculations based on historical
records kept by the Commerce Department.
   By the turn of the century, the South's share of blacks had
declined to 89.7 percent. It has dropped steadily in this century
as blacks moved out of the rural areas and smaller cities of the
South in search of jobs in the Northern and Western industrial
centers.
   Overall, the new study concluded that there were 29.3 million
blacks in the United States as of March 1988, up 13.6 percent since
the 1980 census. That represented 12.2 percent of all Americans, up
from 11.7 percent in 1980.
   The median age for blacks is 27.3 years compared to 33.1 years
for whites. That compares to median ages in 1980 of 24.8 for blacks
and 30.8 for whites.
   Among blacks, there were 88 males for every 100 females,
compared to 96 white males for every 100 white females.
   The large differential among blacks may be related to the lower
mortality rates for women and also to the fact that the census
misses more black males than females in its counts, the report said.
   The percentage of blacks completing four years of high school
increased from 75 percent of those aged 25 to 34 in 1980 to 80
percent in 1988. By comparison, the figure for whites held steady
at 87 percent over that period.
   Despite the gain in high school graduates, however, the report
found that the share of young blacks who had completed college
increased only from 12 percent to 13 percent between 1980 and 1988.
   Black women were slightly more likely than whites to be in the
labor force in 1988, 58 percent to 56.4 percent. For men, 76.9
percnt of whites and 71 percent of blacks were in the labor force.
   The new census report does not include estimates of the black
populations of individual states. However, the bureau defines the
South as including Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Here is a rundown of the percentage of blacks living in the
South for each census since 1880:

<HEAD>U.S. Delegation Says Sanctions Should Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. congressional
delegation said Tuesday that government reforms have failed to
address black voting rights, and U.S. economic sanctions should
remain in place, or even be toughened.
   The three-member group, led by Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.,
acknowledged that ``there have been some positive developments''
since President F.W. de Klerk assumed power in August.
   The delegation, which included Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., and Rep.
Constance Morella, R-Md., cited the release of some political
prisoners and government approval of opposition rallies.
   But the delegation added, ``we could find no evidence that the
government has yet made any decision that it would in fact accept a
democratic government elected by all the people.''
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government within five years.
However, he opposes black majority rule and and envisions a
mechanism that would give whites veto power on major policy
decisions.
   Under the country's apartheid policies, South Africa's 5 million
whites control the government and the economy and maintain separate
schools and neighborhoods. The 28 million blacks have no voice in
national affairs.
   The U.S. delegation spent six days meeting opposition figures
and government leaders, including de Klerk. The Americans said they
would give him a ``reasonable time period'' to initiate
``fundamental reform.''
   They said such reforms must include the release of all political
prisoners, lifting bans on anti-apartheid organizations, removing
soldiers from black townships, lifting the 43-month-old state of
emergency and ending trials considered ``political.''
   The group said current sanctions should remain in place and they
would push for tougher measures if de Klerk does not move ahead
with major reforms.
   A 1986 U.S. bill barred the importation in the United States of
South African coal, steel and agricultural products, imposed
banking restrictions, and cut direct air links between the two
countries.
   Wolpe is chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa
and has pressed for sanctions against South Africa.
   The Bush administration has indicated it will oppose any
tightening of sanctions as long as de Klerk appears to be moving
toward reform.

<TEXT>
   Mount St. Helens trembled after its
biggest outburst in four years, and Alaska's Redoubt Volcano shot
steam and ash in its largest eruption since it reawakened a month
ago, forcing schools to close today.
   Despite Mount St. Helens' eruption and renewed earthquake
activity, scientists said they do not believe the volcano is
entering a more explosive phase.
   Seismic levels rose Monday at the Washington volcano for
unexplained reasons, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University
of Washington Geophysics Center.
   Foul weather kept scientists from flying into the crater by
helicopter to take measurements, gather ash samples and replace
monitoring equipment lost in the volcano's ash burst Saturday.
   Ash collected Sunday was examined under a microscope and found
to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions from the 8,366-foot
peak rather than freshly erupted matter, said Dan Dzurisin, aciting
scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Saturday's burst, which was not preceded by earthquakes, sent
ash 90 miles to the east and destroyed two seismometers and two
tilt meters in the crater.
   Jonientz-Trisler said earthquake signals Saturday indicated the
outburst might have resulted from groundwater reaching superheated
rock beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released
by cooling molten rock.
   The quakes Monday, small but sharp and occurring at an
undetermined depth, resemble some that were recorded last August
but were never explained, she said.
   The latest quake pattern does not resemble any that preceded
previous eruptions, she said. ``We're not especially alarmed,'' she
said.
   The latest eruption was the largest since a series of small
explosions in 1986. On May 18, 1980, a cataclysmic explosion from
the volcano leveled 230 square miles, killed 57 people and sent up
an ash cloud that circled the globe.
   In Alaska on Monday, Redoubt Volcano hurled a plume of steam and
ash almost eight miles into the air before activity subsided in the
afternoon.
   Scientists said the patterns preceding the eruption were very
different from previous blasts from the volcano 115 miles southwest
of Anchorage.
   Most of the ash was carried over the Kenai Peninsula and out
over the Gulf of Alaska. Flights from Anchorage to Kenai and Homer
were canceled immediately. Other flights were canceled as darkness
fell and the ash cloud spread over the gulf.
   The ash plume missed for the most part the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer. But the grit was
sufficiently heavy for officials to close schools today in Kenai,
Soldotna, Nikiski and Sterling.
   Officials said they were concerned about the effect the ash
might have on ventilation systems and didn't want students tracking
ash into the buildings.
   The fishing community of Kasilof south of Kenai was coated with
a quarter-inch of ash. Don Rivers, owner of a Kasilof grocery, said
it was the heaviest ashfall there since the 10,197-foot peak sprang
back to life Dec. 13.
   ``People are pretty much just holing up,'' said Rivers. ``People
are starting to get used to it.''

   Singapore Airlines is holding talks with major
manufacturers to buy airplanes and engines worth $5.29 billion, an
airline spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The aircraft and engines would be delivered starting in 1994,
said the spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In the January issue of the airline's monthly magazine, Outlook,
airline chairman Joe Y. Pillay said the carrier hopes to make an
announcement early this year about new purchases.
   The airline is evaluating competing candidates, he said. The
investment outlay for the last six years of the 1990s be in excess
of $5.29 billion, ``an enormous sum for a medium-sized airline. We
are reasonably confident of our ability to generate the cash needed
from our operations,'' he said.
   ``With the new aircraft, we shall be able to replace older
aircraft, mount additional flights to the points we now serve,
inaugurate services to new points and operate more non-stop
flights,'' he said.
   In March 1986, Singapore Airlines, which is partly government
owned, ordered 20 Boeing 747-400 jets costing $3.3 billion.
Delivery of these aircraft is to be completed before 1994.

<HEAD>Family Says Surgery To Correct Clubfeet Violates Religious Beliefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN BARRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a boy born with deformed
feet have withdrawn an agreement to allow corrective surgery _ even
if the county joins in a ceremony to relieve the family of
responsibility for interfering with God's will.
   ``They feel that even an agreement by way of a settlement would
visit punishment on them because they would nevertheless be
deciding to consent to the surgery. They'd rather have the court
order it done,'' said Rudy Petilla, a lawyer for the boy's father.
   ``I understand that if the kid himself strongly says `I want
it,' they would go ahead,'' Petilla said.
   But 6-year-old Kou Xiong has sided with his parents, Hmongs from
the hill country of Laos, who argue that the Fresno County Social
Services Department lawsuit to force the surgery violates their
religious beliefs.
   The Hmongs believe that God intended the boy to have club feet
and that the family would be punished for interfering with God's
will.
   Ger Xiong and his wife, Houa Vue, last week proposed a ceremony
to direct any ill consequences of tampering with their son's feet
at the agency insisting on the operation, and not the family. The
ceremony would include burning incense, slitting a hen's throat and
sprinkling its blood on ceremonial papers that would later be
burned.
   However, the family changed their minds Monday after speaking
with religious advisers over the weekend, Petilla said.
   ``The parent's religious beliefs are genuine and they are here
in the United States where their freedom of religion is
guaranteed,'' said Ralph Avila, attorney for the boy's mother.
   Lawyers for the family say they are not convinced that the
surgery will improve the boy's condition appreciably.
   ``The surgery is an elective surgery. It's not a matter of life
and death. The child's not in immediate danger,'' said Petilla,
indicating that the surgery could be postponed at least several
years with the same chance for success.
   Susan Anderson, a deputy district attorney representing the boy,
said she plans to petition the court to allow a child psychologist
to evaluate how the boy would react to the surgery.

   Eight stolen works by the French artist
Henri Matisse were recovered Tuesday when police pulled over a man
for a routine check and found the art rolled up on the back seat of
his car, police sources said.
   Franck Cochet was held for questioning in the theft of the five
oil paintings, two drawings and one engraving, which were valued at
$12.5 million, the sources said. They were reported missing Dec. 29.
   Cochet, 24, was recognized by police officers who knew him from
previous theft and drug cases, police sources said.
   When they waved over his car for a routine check, Cochet and a
woman in the passenger seat tried to flee but were stopped. The
woman later was cleared.
   The officers were stunned when they unrolled the art works found
on the car's back seat and found the Matisse works, the sources
said.
   The works, including the well-known paintings ``View Over
Collioure Port,'' ``Woman in Brittany'' and ``Devilacqua,'' were
taken from the empty apartment in Nice's posh Cimiez district in
the hills overlooking the Mediterranean where Matisse lived until
his death in 1954.
   The theft was discovered by the artist's daughter-in-law when
she visited the vacant apartment Dec. 30 for the first time since
November.

<DATELINE>BUCKFIELD, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers who found an 80-pound
semiprecious gem could not agree on a way to sell it, so they had
it chopped up, apparently seriously devaluing it.
   ``I didn't want to see that big stone busted,'' said Dennis
Holden, who found the gem with his brother Ronald Holden Jr. in
October at a quarry they leased in Buckfield. ``I tried to stop him
from getting it out of the bank.''
   Dennis Holden said his brother wanted to bring in partners.
Ronald Holden said setting up a corporation was the only way to
properly market the gem, which contained a single crystal measuring
nearly 13 inches across and weighing about 115,000 carats.
   At the time of their find, the brothers estimated the gem to be
worth $1 million.
   Experts were reluctant to put a value on it, although now that
it has been chopped up, stonecutter James Mann said the brothers
will be lucky to get $60,000. Mann said that this week he struck a
deal to sell two pieces from Dennis Holden's share of the rock for
$16,000 to a museum at Harvard University.
   State geologist Woodrow Thompson said the morganite crystal, a
transparent, rose-colored variety of beryl, should not have been
cut.
   ``I personally, and many other people, would have preferred that
it be kept intact,'' Thompson said. ``It was a splendid mineral
specimen.''
   Dubbed the ``Rose of Maine,'' the gem was chopped up in early
November at the home of Paul Bennett, who owns the mine the Holdens
leased.
   The Holdens, from the town of Norway, each kept chunks weighing
about 17 pounds. Bennett got a 14-pound piece, as well as a 4-pound
piece and a 4-carat piece of tourmaline.

<TEXT>
   A roosting site for monarch
butterflies may be lost to development in the community that calls
itself Butterfly Town, USA.
   The City Council has approved a rezoning plan for the privately
owned property. But voters will first be given a chance to decide
whether their town 70 miles south of San Francisco should buy the
2.7-acre site.
   The property is one of only two winter butterfly roosting sites
left in the city, which celebrates the orange and black butterfly
with a parade every October. Molesting a monarch is a crime that
carries a $500 fine.
   ``We've got to buy that piece of land,'' said Ro Vaccaro,
president of the local Friends of the Monarchs. ``We don't want to
change our name to `Bulldozer Town, USA.'''
   Monarchs from across the West migrate annually to 100 to 200
winter roosting sites dotting the Pacific coast. Pacific Grove's
two sites are the best known, and monarchs have become the city's
main tourist attraction.
   This year, the site slated for development attracted all the
monarchs. The other site, in a city park, failed to attract a
single cluster.
   On Wednesday, the City Council voted 4-3 to allow property owner
Edna Dively to divide the land into six lots as long as she gives
the city 1.5 acres of prime monarch roosting habitat on the
property.
   No development can take place before voters are allowed to
decide whether to buy the property. The election could be in June
or November.
   Council member Bud Nunn, who voted against the plan, fears the
worst.
   ``This development uses up some of the best part of the habitat,
and I don't think the butterflies are going to survive it,'' he
said.

   Two rival Shiite Moslem militias said
Tuesday they were ready to stop fighting, and one suggested there
be talks between militia leaders following battles that killed 94
people in three weeks.
   An Iranian mediator sent to work out a solution said the battle
between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal
militias was ``nearing its end.''
   In Beirut, Christian troops battled Syrian-backed Moslem
militiamen along the Green Line separating the city into Christian
and Moslem sectors.
   No casualties were reported in the 10-minute exchange, but
police expressed alarm over the continued violations of a truce
declared in September.
   The truce halted six months of fighting between soldiers of
Christian army Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops and their allies.
But serious clashes broke out Saturday in Beirut, and four people
have been killed.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, and Aoun declared a ``war of
liberation'' in March to drive them out.
   In south Lebanon, meanwhile, Hezbollah and Amal fighters held
their fire for a second day as Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Mohammad Ali Besharati, tried to arrange a permanent settlement.
   ``It is nearing its end. A cease-fire will be proclaimed soon
and the warring factions will withdraw to their original lines,''
Besharati said after a two-hour meeting in Moslem west Beirut with
Amal chieftain Nabih Berri.
   Berri said he told Besharati that Amal would adhere to the
cease-fire if Hezbollah agreed to withdraw from all territory it
conquered during the previous 17 days of fighting.
   Hezbollah said in a statement it was ready to stop shooting and
begin simultaneous talks for a coexistence that would ``turn all
the guns against the Israeli enemy.''
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the two sides agreed to
exchange prisoners at the same time as a Hezbollah withdrawal.
   The militia fighting has killed 94 people and wounded 275 since
it broke out Dec. 23. Amal and Hezbollah called a seven-hour
cease-fire Monday to allow Red Cross workers to remove corpses from
the battlefield.
   The two factions have been vying for control of Lebanon's 1.2
million-member Shiite community for more than two years.
   Amal disclosed Tuesday that Sheik Mohammed Siklawi, a prominent
Hezbollah cleric who defected to Amal last week, was Hezbollah's
``naval operations commander.''
   Amal spokesmen say Siklawi defected because he refused orders to
mount a naval attack on the Amal-held oil terminal of Zahrani south
of the port city of Sidon.
   Hezbollah confirmed that Siklawi was its naval operations chief.
It charged Amal kidnapped him, and it denied plans of a seaborne
attack.
   In east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, police said two villagers were
wounded when Israel's allied militia, the South Lebanon Army,
poured artillery fire on bases of Syrian-backed Palestinian and
leftist Lebanese guerrillas.
   The area has long been a launching pad for guerrilla raids into
the Israeli-controlled zone in south Lebanon. The 2,500-member,
predominantly Christian SLA and an estimated 1,500 Israeli troops
jointly patrol along the southern border.

<HEAD>Americans Say Prospective Employers `Snoop'</HEAD>

   Nearly 80 percent of American workers surveyed
for a poll released Tuesday say prospective employers have tried to
``snoop'' into their personal lives by asking prying questions
during job interviews.
   The results demonstrate the need for tougher privacy laws, such
as tighter restrictions on how employers use information compiled
by direct mail firms, said Linda Golodner of the National Consumers
League, which conducted the poll.
   For instance, technological advances allow all sorts of
information _ from the type of beverages a person buys at a grocery
store to their drug prescriptions _ to go into computers available
to employers, the group said.
   The poll asked 1,007 adults whether employers had a right to ask
if a job applicant lives with a non-family member of the opposite
sex, has elderly parents, about religious preference, plans to have
children, smoking off-the-job, the nature of after-work hobbies and
marital status.
   The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, said 79 percent of the respondents had been
asked at least one of those questions in a job interview.
   ``In job interviews, Americans say employers routinely snoop
into the privacy of job applicants by asking questions that have no
relationship to job performance,'' Ms. Golodner said.
   Nearly two out of three respondents, or 65 percent, had been
asked their marital status; 46 percent their off-the-job
activities; 23 percent their religious preference; and 16 percent
whether they smoked away from work.
   An overwhelming majority of respondents considered most of the
questions off-limits during interviews. For example, 87 percent
thought it was inappropriate for an employer to ask whom they were
living with and 74 percent didn't think it was an employer's
business whether they smoked away from the job.
   Only the question on marital status was considered by a majority
_ 52 percent _ as an appropriate question for an employer to ask.
   More than 80 percent thought employers, when making hiring and
firing decisions, should not consider outside activities such as
gambling at a race track, holding an unusual second job such as a
bartender or participating in a political demonstration.
   In addition, the poll showed that 81 percent did not think a
business should refuse to hire an overweight person and 76 percent
thought the same rights belonged to smokers.
   The National Consumers League is a private advocacy group
concerned with workplace and marketplace issues.

<TEXT>
   U.S. troops today surrounded the
Peruvian ambassador's residence, where government officials said
two of Manuel Antonio Noriega's top associates _ one an alleged
torturer _ had taken refuge.
   An official of the Peruvian Embassy denied the men were inside
the building.
   They were identified as Capt. Gonzalo Gonzalez, commander of the
Machos de Monte company that provided security for Noriega's
headquarters, and Lt. Col. Luis Cordova, identified by Noriega's
foes as one of the men who interrogated and tortured prisoners of
the overthrown regime.
   The two were considered the most-wanted of the former Noriega
officials sought since the American invasion that ousted the
military leader Dec. 20.
   In a telephone interview today broadcast by a radio station in
Lima, Peru, Manuel Tirado, the third secretary at the embassy, said
a number of Panamanians had taken refuge at the residence of the
charge d'affaires, Luis Sandiga. But he said neither Gonzalez nor
Cordova was there.
   Tirado did not identify the Panamanians in the residence or say
how many were there.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru was one of the strongest critics
of the U.S. invasion, which killed more than 300 U.S. and
Panamanian soldiers. The number of civilian deaths remains unclear.
   After the invasion, Peru recalled its ambassador from Washington
and threatened to boycott a drug summit next month with President
Bush.
   U.S. troops surrounded the ambassador's residence in suburban El
Cangrejo, near the downtown banking district, at noon Monday.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Cordova was inside. Another
government source said Gonzalez was also inside along with Noriega
secretary Marcela Tason, her son and another high-ranking former
government official.
   Tirada refused comment on whether Tason was inside.
   Linares said he would ask the Peruvian mission and other
embassies in Panama for official confirmation and identification of
Noriega associates who had requested asylum.
   A small detachment of American soldiers remained outside the
embassy through the night.
   Noriega holed up in the Vatican Embassy for 10 days before
surrendering to U.S. troops Jan. 3 and being flown to Miami for
prosecution on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   In developments Monday:
   _ The government said it was studying whether it would allow
Noriega's family safe passage to the Dominican Republic. His wife
Felicidad, three daughters and son-in-law, a Dominican, have taken
refuge in the Cuban Embassy.
   Linares said he ``had passed the request for safe conduct to the
Ministry of Government and Justice, and if there is no complaint
against them they will get consent.''
   _First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said the country's
Security Force would include specialized military units, but that
they would be limited to a few hundreds soldiers and not be big
enough to threaten the government.
   Civilians in the government installed Dec. 20 in the early hours
of the U.S. invasion have tried to limit the size of any new
security force to avoid danger of coups. The armed forces ruled
Panama from 1968 until Noriega's overthrow and have been an
important political factor since Panama was founded.
   _President Guillermo Endara sent a letter to President Bush
asking for financial aid to create 24,000 new jobs and for loans to
compensate businesses looted by rampaging crowds following the U.S.
invasion. Looters caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damage.
   _More than 600 members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division left
Panama and returned to Fort Bragg, N.C. In all, about 26,000 U.S.
troops took part in the invasion, slightly more than double the
number normally stationed in Panama.
   Arias would not specify when further U.S. troop withdrawals
would occur, but said he expected them to be gradual over the next
few weeks.
   _The daily La Prensa, closed nearly two years ago by Noriega,
resumed publication with an editorial that assailed the
Organization of American States for voting to ``deplore'' the U.S.
invasion.
   It said the United States had freed Panama ``from a barbarian,
corrupt and demented tyranny that would have led the country to
total ruin with serious risk to the operation of the Panama Canal''
and to the political stability of other Latin American countries.
   Arias said Noriega followers were still at large and believed to
be armed, creating the danger of urban or other guerrilla activity.
   ``We have confiscated more than 79,000 weapons,'' said Arias,
who also is minister of government and justice. ``There are
indications there are more weapons stashed away.''
   ``We also do not know how the drug-dealing Mafia will react.
Noriega had put the resources of this country at their disposal.''
   Arias said the 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would continue for now.
   The curfew is enforced mostly by patrolling U.S. military units
accompanied by one or two members of the Panamanian security force.
On Sunday night more than 300 people were arrested for violating
the curfew.

   A prankster had no qualms about claiming she
held the ticket to a $35 million lottery jackpot. The bona fide
winner was the shy one.
   Antonio Bueti, a 49-year-old auto assembly line worker from
suburban Bedford Hills, failed to show up today at a news
conference presenting him as the winner of the largest unshared
lottery jackpot in New York history.
   ``I would like to say I think I've seen them all now. This is
the first time I've been stood up by a big winner,'' said Russell
V. Gladieux, lottery executive deputy director.
   Gladieux said the lottery sent a limousine to Bueti's home to
pick him up, but there was no answer at the door. ``Very possibly,
one of the reasons he was gun-shy was all of the publicity
surrounding the hoax,'' Gladieux said.
   On Sunday, Charlene Taylor drew a copy of what she said was the
winning ticket from her bosom and showed it to reporters at a
champagne party at a $400-a-night hotel suite. She claimed Donald
Trump and Malcolm Forbes had told her the lucky numbers in a dream.
   She was unmasked by the Daily News, which said the
actress-comedian pulled the prank with help from Alan Abel, a
jokester whose feats include getting his own obituary in The New
York Times and staging mass fainting spells in the audience of a
``Donahue'' show.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought 480,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery next month
under a long-term grain-supply agreement, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said 10 private companies shared in
the sales.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said 1,534,200 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. A new purchase line of 2 million
tons was announced on Dec. 19, in addition to 14,200 tons remaining
in a previous allocation.
   Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviet Union under
the price-subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began on
Oct. 1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought about
1.3 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11
million tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of
the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   In the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union bought
about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million tons of
corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All but about
700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 480,000 tons are equal to 17.6 million bushels worth
around $67 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $20.50 per
ton, or about 56 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the 480,000 tons of wheat were sold by Alfred C.
Toepfer International Inc., 100,000 tons; Harvest States
Cooperatives, 80,000; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
50,000; Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 50,000; Union Equity Cooperative
Exchange, 50,000; Cargill Inc., 25,000; Continental Grain Co.,
25,000; J. Aron &amp; Co., 25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp.,
25,000.

<HEAD>Vatican Urges Seminarians to Go Back to Basics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students for the priesthood need to return
to the basics, learn Greek and Latin, and study the teaching of the
church's earliest writers, the Vatican said Tuesday.
   The Congregation for Catholic Education said seminaries and
theological faculties should place greater emphasis on the study of
the writers of the early centuries whose work is considered the
basis of church doctrine and orthodoxy.
   The writers, who represent both Eastern and Western Christian
tradition, are known as the Fathers of the Church and the study of
their work is called patristics and patrology.
   In a document titled ``Instruction on the Study of The Fathers
of the Church in the Formation of Priests,'' the Vatican stressed
that the ancient writings are still relevant.
   ``Theological reflection has always been clearly aware that
there is something in the Fathers which is unique, irreplaceable
and perenially valid,'' it said. ``In order for the church to
continue growing, it is necessary to know their doctrine and works
thoroughly.''
   The document lamented that theologians often give scant
attention to the early teachings, which sometimes become ``caught
up in an overall rejection of the past'' or ``taken over by the
various fashionable philosophies and ideologies of the day.''
   ``Theologians ... think that they are doing theology but are
really only doing history, sociology, etc.,'' it said.
   The document said many theology students don't know the
classical languages necessary for studying the works of the
Fathers, who wrote in Latin and Greek.
   ``Given the well-known deficiencies in the humanities in today's
schools, everything possible will have to be done to strengthen the
study of Greek and Latin in centers of priestly formation,'' the
document said.
   The document offered some guidelines for teaching of pastristic
studies, saying it should be taught as a discipline in itself and
not included in courses such as church history or ancient Christian
literature.
   At a news conference, Archbishop Jose Saraiva Martins, secretary
of the Vatican congregation, said the document coincides with next
fall's worldwide Synod of Bishops on the formation of priests.
   After a long period of decline, the number of Roman Catholics
entering the priesthood, religious orders and seminaries worldwide
has picked up in recent years.
   The number of ordinations of priests grew from 5,918 in 1978 to
7,251 in 1987, according to the most recent report on the subject
issued by the Vatican.
   The growth of vocations has been greatest in South America,
Africa and Asia, although they have continued to decline in the
United States.

   Bells in 144 countries and the 50 United States
will ring out Monday to honor Martin Luther King Jr. on what would
have been the slain civil rights leader's 61st birthday.
   For the first time, the day will be celebrated on a large scale
in white-ruled South Africa. Pro-democracy demonstrations around
the world last year also have added impetus to the holiday by
mirroring King's tactics and philosophy.
   In King's hometown of Atlanta, center of yearly King Week
celebrations, the 1990 federal holiday comes amid death threats
that followed last month's mail bombings of civil rights and
judicial targets in three states.
   ``With the Klan and the mail bombs, this year it has a more
special meaning for everybody,'' said state Sen. Arthur Langford,
who portrays King in a yearly production of Langford's play ``Life
of a King.''
   ``People must understand that, in the words of Dr. King, we must
learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish
together as fools,'' he said.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, says she is reluctant to draw
more attention to the violence of the mail bombs and is emphasizing
the parallels of pro-democracy reforms sweeping Eastern Europe with
the civil rights movement.
   King Week 1990, a week of events sponsored by the King Center
for Nonviolent Social Change and the King Federal Holiday
Commission, culminates Monday, the first time the holiday falls on
King's actual birthday.
   King led a non-violent movement for racial equality in the 1950s
and 1960s that led to passage of federal legislation ending
official discrimination and segregation. He was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
   In South Africa, an unprecedented weeklong celebration will
climax Jan. 20, when about 10,000 people are expected at a
Johannesburg ceremony honoring leaders including Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and political opposition leader Allan Boesak.
   ``This will be the first time they've celebrated the holiday on
this kind of scale,'' said Lloyd Davis of Atlanta, a holiday
organizer.
   At 12:30 p.m. EST Monday, the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia will
be tapped as bells worldwide are rung to honor King.
   Bells also will be rung in the three states _ Montana, Idaho and
New Hampshire _ that have not recognized the day as a state
holiday, organizers said.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus has urged the Idaho Legislature to recognize
King Day.
   ``It is time we in Idaho give proper recognition to those
Americans who have caused us as a state and a nation to rise up
against the evils of racism, bigotry and hatred,'' Andrus said in
his State of the State address.
   Wyoming is celebrating King Day for the first time, after
Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan bucked the wishes of the
Republican-controlled Legislature and issued an executive order
calling for the holiday. However, the order only applies this year.
   In Arizona, King Day is on hold. A bill creating a paid state
holiday passed the Legislature last fall and was signed by Gov.
Rose Mofford. But opponents filed petitions calling for the issue
to be put to the voters in November, keeping the law from becoming
effective pending a referendum.
   However, a King Day breakfast in Phoenix is expected to draw
1,500.
   In Atlanta Thursday, Mrs. King and actor John Amos, who played
Kunte Kinte in the TV mini-series ``Roots,'' will unveil a
``Behold'' sculpture at the King National Historic Site. The
sculpture is a bronze figure of an African man holding his newborn
daughter skyward in a gesture to God _ an image inspired by
``Roots.''
   Also Thursday, Jesse Jackson is to address the National College
and University Student Conference at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
King preached.
   Mrs. King will give her annual ``State of the Dream'' address
Sunday. Marianne Clarke, coordinator for the King Center's annual
assembly, said Mrs. King will call for continued non-violent
demonstrations for freedom worldwide.
   A parade and march down Atlanta's Peachtree Street will conclude
Monday's events. Margie Hollums of the federal holiday commission
said parade grand marshal Sammy Davis Jr. canceled because of poor
health and the commission plans to announce his replacement this
week. This is the first year the parade and march will be
nationally televised.
   Stoney Johnson, King Center media director, said security will
not be increased during any King Week activities despite the mail
bombs.
   ``It's so intense anyway that we don't need any more,'' he said.
   But Danny Levitan, executive director of the Center for
Democratic Renewal, which tracks hate group activity, warned that
violence may erupt in Atlanta just after King Day and the rest of
the nation ``should expect some attempts to disrupt events or
commit acts of violence'' Monday.
   On Jan. 20, Mississippi white supremacist Richard Barrett plans
to hold a protest across from King's crypt in Atlanta. Last year,
he led a rally at the Capitol and a march through downtown that
drew more than 1,000 law enforcement officials.

   Engineer Lenwood Clark watched
Tuesday's fiery liftoff of the space shuttle Columbia looking
forward to seeing the spacecraft bring down a project of his that
is years overdue.
   On Friday, the shuttle is to catch up with and retrieve the Long
Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF.
   ``I spent seven or eight years working with the experiments
prior to LDEF being launched and having to wait almost six years
for the recovery activity to finally occur has been interesting to
say the least,'' said Clark, a senior project engineer at NASA's
Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.
   The large satellite, containing 57 self-contained experiments,
was deployed by the crew of the space shuttle Challenger on April
7, 1984. It was supposed to remain in orbit for less than a year,
to see how various materials react in space, including tomato
seeds, but its retrieval was delayed because of scheduling changes
and the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   The satellite's orbit has been rapidly decaying and the
21,400-pound structure will plunge back into the atmosphere and
burn up in early March if not picked up by Columbia's astronauts.
   ``If LDEF is not recovered, the loss would be tremendous,'' said
Robert M. Walker, director of the McConnell Center for the Space
Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis and co-investigator
on one of LDEF's experiments.
   Walker, Clark and a host of scientists have long awaited LDEF's
return, but they say the added time in space may have enhanced some
experiments, although others may have suffered some degradation
from radiation, micrometeoroids and other particles, and vacuum.
   Scientists don't know what they may find because no other craft
has ever been returned safely to Earth after such long exposure to
space.
   ``We have 200 investigators in nine countries and those are the
people that really built the experiments and are anxious to get
them back in their labs and begin with the data analysis,'' Clark
said. ``Those are really the ones that should be excited.''
   One of the major goals of LDEF was to test materials for use in
future spacecraft and the eventual construction of a space station.
   ``The majority of the experiments relate to understanding the
effects of various things in the environment of space _ materials,
coatings, optics, electronic devices _ all those things you
typically build spacecraft out of.''
   ``That information is going to be extremely important in the
design of future spacecraft, especially those that are going to
last for long periods of time,'' Clark said.
   ``How do you design a facility that will survive the rigors of
space for that period of time without some real information about
those materials that are used in the construction?'' Clark asked.
   Columbia's launch at 7:35 a.m. Tuesday was timed so that it
could rendevous with the LDEF on Friday, after 14 course
corrections.
   Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar will reach out with Columbia's
50-foot robot arm and snag the satellite.
   About four hours will be spent photographing the exterior of the
satellite and its experiments.
   Dunbar will then use the arm to tuck LDEF into the cargo bay for
its return trip to Earth.
   Other experiments aboard LDEF were designed to gather
interstellar gas atoms and micrometeoroid material.
   Also on the satellite are 12.5 million tomato seeds, which will
be distributed to students from elementary school through the
university level to be planted to see how living material is
affected.
   ``The numerous science experiments relate to the environments on
living organisms and that relates to being able to live and work in
space for long periods ot time,'' Clark said.

   The $80,000 fund that figured in Evan Mecham's
downfall belongs to the state, a judge ruled today, buttressing the
Legislature's belief that the former governor misused public money
in borrowing from the account.
   Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Kenneth Reeves III said that the
money became state property when it was delivered to the office of
the governor and Mecham cannot reclaim it. The fund totals about
$100,000 with penalties and interest.
   ``I wasn't surprised, but we're very pleased,'' said Attorney
General Bob Corbin. ``It exonerates the Legislature, too.''
   In 1988, Mecham was impeached by the House and convicted and
removed from office in a Senate trial on charges he misused public
money from the fund in loaning $80,000 to his auto dealership.
   The first-term Republican contended the money belonged to him
because it was raised to help meet campaign expenses. At his Senate
trial, he also was convicted of trying to obstruct an investigation
of an alleged death threat against an aide.
   Mecham, 65, was unavailable for comment, a receptionist at his
suburban Glendale office said.
   The state had argued that the fund, made up of donations to
Mecham's inauguration, became public money when the inaugural
committee chairman wrote a letter saying the funds would be
transferred to the governor's office for Mecham's ceremonial use.

<HEAD>Communist Hard-liners Said to Heighten Ethnic Strife</HEAD>

   An outbreak of Slavic nationalist protest
against the Turkish minority appears to be an attempt by Communist
hard-liners to preserve their power in Bulgaria, an opposition
leader said Tuesday.
   ``It's an organized process from lower and middle levels'' of
the Communist Party, ``and even some people at the top,'' said
Petko Simeonov, a leader of the opposition Club for Glasnost and
Democracy.
   Thousands of nationalists in the past week have staged strikes
and demonstrations in at least eight cities across Bulgaria to
protest a Dec. 29 decision by central authorities to restore
cultural and religious rights to the country's estimated 1.5
million Moslems, mostly ethnic Turks.
   For years, ethnic Turks were subjected to a harsh assimilation
policy under which they were forced to adopt Bulgarian names and to
speak Bulgarian.
   When former leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10, he was
succeeded by Petar Mladenov who promised to steer Bulgaria out of
its Stalinist past and into a democratic future.
   However, the outburst of anti-Turk sentiment is embarrassing
Mladenov's government and could upset the talks planned for Jan. 16
between the Communists and the opposition on reforms and the free
elections Mladenov promised by May.
   The protests ``could push the country in a neo-Fascist and
nationalist direction,'' said Simeonov. ``This problem could deform
the democratic processes in Bulgaria and postpone the talks.''
   The regional branch of the independent trade union Podkrepa in
southern Haskovo and Kardzhali, where some of the most vehement
ethnic protests occurred last week, claims that local officials
commandeered buses and cars, megaphones and flags for the protests.
   Opposition leaders and Western diplomats say the deep mistrust
between nationalist Slavs and ethnic Turks has been fanned since
the mid-1980s by Zhivkov's assimilation policy and by anti-Turkish
propaganda.
   Konstantin Trenchev, a leader of the Union of Democratic Forces,
an umbrella opposition group, doubts the hard-liners can retain
lasting influence, given the radical changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``They cannot exist alone in the world, isolated between East
and West,'' he said.
   Senior Communist leaders, opposition members, representatives of
the Turkish minority and Slav nationalists met Tuesday to try to
defuse the situation. On Monday, they called for an end to further
large protests or strikes and the tensions appear to have eased.
   But the bitter hostility between Slavs and ethnic Turks is
deeply ingrained and ready to flare up at the slightest
provocation. A few dozen anti-Turk demonstrators gathered again
Tuesday around the National Assembly, or parliament, in Sofia.
   Slavic resentment of Turks has its roots in 500 years of rule by
the Ottoman Empire. Bulgaria won its independence in 1877, but
ethnic tensions persist.
   A wave of unrest in May swept regions where most of the ethnic
Turks live when they protested assimilation and clashed with
security forces. According to officials, seven people died.
Diplomats say up to 30 may have been killed.
   After that, Zhivkov's leadership began expelling local leaders
of ethnic Turks. As many as 5,000 were expelled, and at least
300,000 more then emigrated to Turkey, fearful of more persecution.
   Western diplomats say about 90,000 ethnic Turks are believed to
have returned, but an estimated 310,000 are waiting for a decision
on their applications to emigrate.
   In August, Turkey stopped the free flow of immigrants from
Bulgaria because it could not cope with the influx and it insists
that newcomers have entry visas.
   Viktor Orlinov, an ethnic Turk living in Sofia, said his family
in southern Bulgaria was among those ordered to leave this year.
   ``My father died of a heart attack not long after he heard the
news,'' Orlinov said.
   He discounted what he said were Slavic claims that Moslem
fundamentalism could emerge in Bulgaria, or ethnic Turks could some
day demand autonomy.
   ``All we want is for our children to grow up in freedom,'' he
said. ``We are for Bulgaria, for prosperity. And we think this
controversy can be overcome.''

<HEAD>Saudi, Iraqi Ministers Inaugurate Pipeline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED IBRAHIM</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AL-MU'AJJIS, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The oil ministers of Saudi
Arabia and Iraq on Tuesday inaugurated a new pipeline that
stretches nearly 1,000 miles across the kingdom and will boost
Iraq's oil export capacity considerably.
   Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia and his Iraqi counterpart, Issam
Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, inaugurated the IPSA-2 pipeline after the
completion Dec. 22 of the third and final berth at the Red Sea
terminal at Al-Mu'ajjis.
   IPSA-2 runs parallel to IPSA-1, which came on line in 1985. The
$2.7 billion, 979-mile network can carry 1.65 million barrels a day.
   Iraq also has a pipeline running through Turkey with a capacity
of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Chalabi described the pipeline as ``an ideal example of the
brotherly cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iraq not only for
its technical and economic considerations, but also for its
strategic significance for Iraq.''
   Iraq is observing its production quota of 3.14 million barrels a
day, decreed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   But it is eager to increase its oil revenues, which stand at
about $12.5 billion a year, to help meet its foreign debt payments
and pay for reconstruction needed after the war with Iran.
   Chalabi said in a recent interview that completion of the
trans-Saudi pipelines would bring Iraq's oil export capacity to 3.5
million barrels daily.
   The U.S. engineering company Brown and Root prepared the basic
design for the IPSA project.

   Prosecutors trying the cocaine-trafficking
case against Manuel Antonio Noriega will likely face a barrage of
defense attacks on the credibility of government witnesses who once
smuggled drugs.
   A key prosecution witness against the deposed Panamanian ruler
is expected to be convicted drug smuggler Floyd Carlton Caceres,
who is serving a nine-year sentence for drug trafficking.
   The background of Carlton and other witnesses likely to testify
in Noriega's Miami trial illustrates the problem prosecutors will
encounter when they ask jurors to accept the word of convicted
criminals.
   But legal experts say the problem is common to such cases,
where, in the absence of wiretaps or testimony by undercover
agents, the only sources of information about a defendant are
unsavory people who were part of a drug operation.
   President Bush and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have said
the case against Noriega is strong, indicating a belief among
federal prosecutors that their witnesses' testimony will hold up in
court.
   Defense lawyers will argue that the jury shouldn't believe
testimony from disreputable people that Noriega was part of a drug
conspiracy.
   ``The answer the government is going to give is `Who do you
expect him to associate with?'' said a former federal prosecutor
who specialized in drug cases.
   ``It's not an insurmountable problem; in fact, its a typical
problem,'' said the former prosecutor, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``A major issue will be the ability of the government
to corroborate the evidence from each of the witnesses.''
   Carlton has testified before Congress that he arranged for the
Medellin drug cartel to pay Noriega $200,000 for each planeload of
cocaine that was protected as it was shipped through Panama to the
United States.
   Others who may testify are convicted money launderer Ramon
Milian Rodriguez and convicted smuggler Steven M. Kalish. Both have
testified about the protection Noriega allegedly gave Colombian
drug lords, including armored-car transport of cash and the use of
military airfields.
   In addition, prosecutors could conceivably call as witnesses any
of the five arrested Noriega co-defendants who decide to plead
guilty and, in return for a reduced sentence, testify against
Noriega.
   An attorney for one of those co-defendants, Luis del Cid,
indicated Monday that his client was considering becoming a
government witness.
   ``There was a very preliminary exchange of amenities where the
possibility of some settlement was discussed,'' defense attorney
Samuel Burstyn said of discussions with federal prosecutors.
   ``We're desirous of exploring all options, but no offers have
been made on either side and there are no deals,'' he said.
   The indictment describes del Cid, who surrendered last month to
invading U.S. forces, as an emissary and a courier of Noriega to
the drug cartel.
   The indictment says del Cid arranged the payment of money from
the Medellin cartel to Noriega.
   Del Cid presumably could corroborate Carlton's past testimony
about one alleged payment of protection money that is described in
the indictment.
   The indictment says that, at Noriega's direction, Carlton
delivered $200,000 to del Cid at the headquarters of the Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   The indictment adds that payment was made to cover the price
Noriega and Carlton agreed they would charge the Colombian drug
lords to protect the next shipment of cocaine through Panama.
   Shortly after the purported payment was delivered to del Cid,
Carlton is alleged to have flown 400 kilograms of cocaine to a
Panamanian airstrip from the farm of Medellin cartel leader Pablo
Escobar Gaviria.
   Another likely prosecution witness is Jose Blandon, a former
Panamanian diplomat and one-time confidant of Noriega who has told
the Senate and the grand jury that indicted Noriega that the
ex-ruler took protection money.
   Blandon, a political adviser to Noriega who defected two years
ago, told a Senate subcommittee that the Panamanian dictator had
claimed to have been paid as much as $7 million to look out for the
interests of the Medellin cartel in Panama.
   Among other things, he described an alleged dispute between the
drug lords and Noriega following a raid on a drug-processing plant.
Blandon said the dispute was mediated by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Blandon testified that Noriega and Castro met in 1984, after
Panamanian authorities arrested 23 Colombians and Lt. Col. Julian
Melo, the secretary general of Noriega's staff. The raid occurred
while Noriega was in Paris.
   Blandon said the outraged Colombians claimed they had paid Melo
$5 million to protect the plant.
   At the meeting, Blandon said, Castro assured Noriega there would
be no retaliation by the drug lords. Soon after the meeting, the 23
Colombians and Melo were freed and $3 million plus equipment seized
in the raid were returned, Blandon said.
   Blandon's story has been denounced by Castro and Noriega as a
lie.
   Blandon has not been accused by federal prosecutors of
involvement in drug trafficking. His Miami attorney, Atlee Wampler,
dismissed attempts by defense lawyers in public statements to
question Blandon's reliability.
   Blandon attended some key meetings as Noriega's de facto
secretary of state, but ``he had absolutely no involvement in any
shape with drug trafficking,'' Wampler said. ``He was never
involved, that's why defense lawyers want to discredit him.''

<HEAD>Rebels Threaten New Coup If Aquino Does Not Close U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebellious soldiers will launch a
coup attempt within a few weeks unless President Corazon Aquino
resigns or promises to close U.S. military bases here, a man
claiming to speak for the rebels said Tuesday.
   There was no comment from the presidential staff to the threat,
made in a telephone call to The Associated Press.
   Earlier, Mrs. Aquino said the collapse of Communist governments
in Eastern Europe indicated it was time to consider alternative
uses for the six military installations in the Philippines.
   A caller claiming to represent the Reform the Armed Forces
Movement-Soldiers of the Filipino People claimed a new coup attempt
was imminent unless Mrs. Aquino accepted rebel demands.
   ``We will do so within the next few weeks unless the
`governor-general' (Mrs. Aquino) steps down or declares a
unilateral statement that the U.S. bases will be terminated. If
those bases are not terminated within the next few weeks then (we
will complete) the unfinished revolution,'' said the caller, who
refused to give his name.
   ``If she does not step down, we have no choice. ... We will
launch not just another (coup) but we will keep on launching
them,'' he added.
   The caller asked the U.S. government to refrain from extending
military support to Aquino forces in the event of another assault.
   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets provided air cover to government troops
during the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, which killed at least 113 people.
   ``It is the U.S. government responsibility if it chooses to
stick its finger where it does not belong. This is a fight between
the Filipino people and the ruling elite,'' the caller said.
   The December attack was the sixth and most serious attempt to
overthrow Mrs. Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.
   The Justice Department recommended Tuesday that rebellion
charges be filed against Cagayan provincial Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo
for his alleged support of the mutiny. Government prosecutors must
decide whether to indict Aguinaldo, a former lieutenant colonel.
   Mrs. Aquino told a panel formed to study alternative uses for
the six U.S. military bases that the collapse of Communist regimes
in Eastern Europe and attempts at arms reduction by the superpowers
indicated the Philippines must consider civilian uses for the U.S.
bases.
   But Mrs. Aquino did not say whether she was in favor of phasing
out the U.S. military bases, maintained under an agreement that
expires in 1991.
   U.S and Filipino officials are expected to begin talks by March
on extending the bases' agreement. Any extension must be approved
by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the
installations is strong.

<HEAD>Some Envelopes Sent Taxpayers for Returns Have Incorrect Addresses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You live in Florida and have been sending your
tax returns to Atlanta for years when, for no reason, you're
supposed to file to Fresno, Calif. Why?
   The answer is that somebody goofed. Maybe 566,000 times.
   About one in 200 of the 107 million tax-form packages mailed by
the IRS last month contained return envelopes with the wrong
address, IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said Tuesday. ``For example, a
taxpayer in Maryland, who normally would file to Philadelphia,
might receive a package with an envelope carrying a Cincinnati
address,'' Pyrek explained.
   The potential problem affects tax-form kits identified with a
``Package 1'' notation on the bottom right corner of the cover. The
packages contain the basic long Form 1040 plus Schedules A, for
deductions, and B, for interest and dividends.
   The folks at the IRS are red-faced but say there is no reason
for panic. ``This shouldn't present a problem for the IRS or for
taxpayers,'' Pyrek said.
   The IRS has service centers in 10 cities. Page 5 of the package
tells you where your return is supposed to be filed. If that
address does not match the one on your envelope, Pyrek said, you
may:
   _Use another envelope, writing in the address for your service
center.
   _Use the IRS envelope but mark out the wrong address and the
Postal Service bar code and write in the proper address.
   _Use the IRS envelope just as it came to you _ wrong address and
all. Because relatively few envelopes with wrong addresses are
involved, Pyrek said, that will not upset IRS workload schedules
and will not delay processing of the return. More importantly, it
will not delay any refund, he added.
   Pyrek said the problem envelopes have been found in eight of the
10 regions. Only the Ogden, Utah, center, which processes returns
from most of the West, and the Memphis, Tenn., center, which
handles returns from Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina and Tennessee, have been exempt.
   But that is subject to change. The IRS at first thought only
seven regions were affected, Pyrek said, but ``we just found out
that somebody in Delaware got an envelope with a Fresno address.''
   The problem apparently originated with one of the many private
printers the IRS pays to print and bind tax-return packages. ``We
think there was some kind of problem in the list the printer used
to stuff the envelopes into the packages,'' Pyrek said. ``It's not
clear to us yet.''
   The IRS has heard of no taxpayer receiving the wrong envelope in
the instructions for the simpler basic forms, the 1040A and the
1040EZ.
   But it is a rare year when the agency does not make some kind of
mistake in writing and printing nearly 100 different individual tax
forms and schedules and the dozens of publications that explain
them.
   Already this year the IRS has corrected a goof on Form 2441,
which parents use to claim a credit for child-care expenses.
   The form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6
reading: ``If the result here is zero or less, stop here; you
cannot claim the credit.'' That sentence should read: ``If the
result is zero or less, skip lines 7 through 11, enter zero on line
12 and go to line 13.''

   A year-end rush on movie theaters helped push
1989's box-office figures to $5.02 billion, smashing the $4.46
billion record set the year before, a trade industry newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   Domestic ticket sales for 1989 also hit a five-year high of 1.13
billion, a 4 percent jump over the 1988 total, Daily Variety
reported.
   The year ended with a bang for the film industry, with a record
$636 million grossed during the six weeks between Thanksgiving and
New Year's. The gross for the last six weeks of 1988 was $605
million.
   The year-end record came despite a brief mid-December slump that
the newspaper said was attributable in part to Christmas Eve
falling on a Sunday.
   Last year was the 28th year that annual ticket sales have been
essentially stable in a range around 1.05 billion, Daily Variety
said.
   ``To some that may spell stagnation, given population increases,
etc.,'' the newspaper said. ``To others it signifies marvelous
stability given the tremendous increase in audiovisual
entertainment media.''

<HEAD>Future of Research Monkeys in Hands of Federal Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Animal rights groups have no legal right to
represent eight research monkeys seized in a 1981 raid on a
Maryland laboratory, a government attorney argued before a federal
appeals court Tuesday.
   ``Mere interest is insufficient to make them anything more than
a common bystander,'' Justice Department attorney Lowell Sturgill
told a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He asked the 5th Circuit to lift a district judge's temporary
restraining order forbidding the National Institutes of Health or
Tulane University, which is caring for the monkeys at the Delta
Primate Research Center in Covington, from killing three of the
monkeys.
   One of the monkeys is in such bad shape that attorneys will ask
the court Wednesday for permission to kill it immediately, said
Sturgill. ``His condition is deteriorating rapidly, to the point
that he may die at any time,'' he said.
   In response, Peggy Woodward, representing People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, made an impassioned plea for the judges to
leave the order it won intact and send the case back to district
court for a trial about who should care for the monkeys.
   ``Underlying all their legal arguments is the unstated premise
... that `We are Science and they are Anti-Science,''' she said.
   ``In the name of science ... these monkeys were hideously
mutilated _ senselessly, needlessly, unjustly,'' said Woodward.
``We are not against science. We are against that kind of conduct.''
   She said PETA had more than an outsider's interest in the
monkeys because NIH, which serves as the principal custodian of the
animals, and the animals' owner, the Institute of Behavioral
Resources, had agreed not to kill them if PETA would care for them.
   She said they had reneged on that agreement.
   PETA was founded by Alex Pacheco, whose report to authorities
about the monkeys' condition in 1981 prompted a police raid on the
Behavioral Resources laboratory in Silver Spring, Md., where
Pacheco then worked.
   The animals were part of a study of stroke and spinal cord
injury rehabilitation paid for by NIH. Researchers had cut the
sensory nerves to the left arms of seven of the monkeys and to both
arms of one.
   Unable to feel pain, the monkeys had bitten and otherwise
injured their arms, sometimes severely, according to officials at
Delta Regional Primate Research Center, where they were moved in
1987.
   Researcher Edward Taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to
animals, but five were reversed by a state appeals court. The
Maryland Supreme Court overturned the sixth, ruling that state law
against cruelty to animals did not apply to research facilities.
   Sturgill said the 5th Circuit should follow the Maryland courts'
lead. Woodward said the current case deals with different law.
   Woodward said both the IBR and NIH had written that the monkeys
were of no use for any other studies after they were confiscated
from the laboratory.

   Shuttle Columbia opened a new decade
of space travel Tuesday with a letter-perfect launch and the start
of a search-and-rescue mission for a scientific satellite drifting
back to Earth.
   After three weeks of delays, the shuttle lifted off precisely on
time just after dawn at 7:35 a.m. and began chasing the satellite,
which was 1,500 miles ahead of the shuttle.
   ``I don't think I've ever seen a cleaner countdown and launch,''
said Richard Truly, administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. ``What a marvelous way to start the 1990s.''
   The flight begins a decade in which shuttles will transport
astronauts and materials to build America's space station. The
station is an essential step for a return to the moon and
expeditions to Mars envisioned by President Bush.
   Columbia's mission is scheduled to last 10 days, the
second-longest since shuttles began flying in 1981. The ship is
being modified gradually for 16-day journeys and the extended
mission is to be a test toward that objective.
   The 200-mile-high pursuit is to end Friday morning when
commander Dan Brandenstein and his crew of four catch up with the
bus-size satellite called the Long Duration Exposure Facility. It
will take 14 course corrections to get them there.
   The first of those, in midafternoon, edged Columbia closer to
the invisible path traveled by the satellite.
   It was, said Mission Control's Brian Welch, ``like changing
lanes on the freeway.''
   The crew, meanwhile, ran the shuttle's remote crane through its
paces and found it in good shape, beamed some spectacular
television pictures to the ground and activated two of eight
experiments on their to-do list. There were a few small problems
but none caused Mission Control any headaches.
   ``Columbia is a very clean machine,'' Welch said.
   Atmospheric drag has been pulling LDEF to Earth about half a
mile a day, a rate that is increasing. NASA calculates that left
undisturbed, LDEF would make a fiery death dive through the
atmosphere about March 9 and its scientific experiments would be
lost.
   In a slightly lower orbit, Columbia was circling the globe a
little faster, gradually narrowing the distance with Brandenstein
and pilot Jim Wetherbee at the controls.
   ``Dan is one of the finest stick handlers we've seen, and Jim is
not far behind,'' said flight director Al Pennington in Houston.
   If all goes as planned, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar will
snare the satellite with the shuttle's robot crane on Friday and
lift it into the cargo bay for the trip home.
   There is other work, too, for the five astronauts. On Wednesday
they will release a 17,000-pound communications satellite to
complete a set of four leased to the Navy by their owner, Hughes
Communications.
   Tuesday's launch was the first in four years from pad 39A, which
had undergone a $50 million upgrading. With two pads in operation,
NASA hopes to conduct a record nine more missions this year.
   ``We're off to a good mission, I'm delighted,'' said Truly, a
former astronaut who returned to NASA as space flight director
after the Challenger disaster. This was the eighth liftoff since
that 1986 explosion and Truly said ``I don't know how many flights
we'll fly this decade, but my objective is to fly them all like the
last seven.''
   NASA had to scrub the launch on Monday because of cloudy skies.
It was partly cloudy on Tuesday, but visibility was within NASA's
strict limits and tens of thousands watched from vantage points
near the Kennedy Space Center.
   The LDEF, weighing 11 tons, has been in orbit since it was
released from the Challenger cargo bay in 1984. By midday Tuesday
it had completed 32,372 orbits of Earth _ traveling more than 800
million miles.
   Essentially, the LDEF is a 12-sided frame holding 57 panels of
experiments that have been exposed to space as a test of durability
for use in constructing future spacecraft. It was supposed to be in
orbit for a year; instead it stayed up for nearly six because of
scheduling problems and the Challenger accident.
   Brandenstein and Wetherbee are guiding the shuttle through a
series of intricate maneuvers to close in on their quarry.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' Brandenstein
said in a recent interview. ``But NASA has plenty experience doing
this type of rendezvous, and Jim and I have practiced it to
perfection in the simulator.''
   Once the satellite is secure in the shuttle cargo bay,
Brandenstein, Wetherbee, Dunbar and mission specialists Marsha
Ivins and David Low will concentrate on experiments for the rest of
the flight. The emphasis will be on materials processing and tests
of how the human body adapts to weightlessness.

   Slightly fewer people rode Amtrak last year,
but they helped bring about record revenues by taking longer trips
and spending more on food, the quasi-governmental corporation
reported.
   In a report for fiscal 1989, which ended Sept. 30, the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation said the number of passengers dipped
from 21.5 million to 21.4 million.
   But revenues of $1.27 billion were up from $1.1 billion a year
earlier. Passenger miles, defined as one passenger being carried
one mile, rose from 5.7 billion in 1988 to 5.9 billion, Amtrak
reported.
   That income covered 72 percent of Amtrak's costs, up from 69
percent a year earlier and the best revenue-to-cost performance in
the agency's history, it said in the report released Monday.
   The difference between revenues and costs is made up by federal
appropriations. Amtrak says its goal is to eliminate operating
subsidies from the government in the next 10 years.
   As recently as 1981, Amtrak's revenues covered less than half of
its costs.
   President Bush proposed in his first budget last year to
eliminate Amtrak subsidies, just as President Reagan had done
earlier. But Congress went ahead with funds for Amtrak, providing
$615 million for the current fiscal year, 1990.
   Amtrak said that to end the dependence on operating subsidies it
will need capital grants to expand its fleet and facilities.
   In the annual report, Amtrak said passenger-related revenue
climbed nearly 14 percent, from $766 million in fiscal 1988 to $870
million. Passenger-related revenue includes receipts from fares and
food-service sales.
   The rest of the revenue came from mail and express shipments,
real estate income and other activities.
   The average trip was for 274 miles last year, compared with 264
miles in the previous year, Amtrak said. Part of the reason for the
half-percent decline in passenger numbers was that cars had to be
taken out of service temporarily as part of a ``more aggressive
program of equipment maintenance.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked to Allow Bible Groups on School Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme
Court Tuesday to allow student Bible and prayer groups to meet on
public school grounds, arguing that such a ruling would preserve
religious freedom.
   However, a lawyer for Omaha, Neb., school officials, whose
refusal to approve a Bible-reading club led to the case, said
education administrators must have the authority to make such
decisions.
   Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, the administration's chief
courtroom lawyer, urged the court to interpret expansively a 1984
federal law aimed at permitting religious clubs in public high
schools.
   As envisioned by Congress, the Equal Access Act's ``primary
thrust was to protect religious liberty,'' Starr said during an
hour-long argument in the Nebraska case. ``It's quite clear the
purpose of the act was to eliminate discrimination against
religious groups.''
   Opponents of the 1984 law say it violates the constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
   But the justices, expected to announce a decision by July,
focused on a narrow issue _ the scope of the law.
   The act says public high schools accepting federal aid must not
discriminate against groups based on ``the religious, political,
philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings.''
   The law requires access to school facilities for religious clubs
if other ``non-curriculum-related student groups'' are allowed to
meet.
   Most of Tuesday's argument focused on whether such student
activities as chess and scuba diving clubs are related to school
curriculum, and whether judges or school officials should decide
that question.
   Allen E. Daubman, a lawyer for the school system, said Omaha's
Westside High School had not authorized a public forum for any
group to meet on school grounds simply by authorizing clubs related
to classroom learning.
   Chess helps students learn mathematics and logic, he said. Scuba
diving is linked to the school's physical fitness program.
   If the Equal Access Act is interpreted to force schools to
permit student religious groups in such cases it ``stifles the
efforts of educators to structure a program that is relevant and
provides benefits to the students,'' Daubman said.
   But Jay Alan Sekulow, representing the group of students who
tried to form the Bible-reading club, said the law would be made
worthless ``by administrative fiat'' if the school officials
prevail.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said Daubman seemed to be
arguing for total discretion for school administrators. He said the
lawyer's position ``allows any school district to totally avoid the
act.''
   But Justice John Paul Stevens warned of a danger if the
Bible-reading group wins the case.
   There is ``a price if (a school) becomes a political forum,''
Stevens told Sekulow. ``All these other groups must be permitted.''
   For example, Stevens suggested the school would be forced to
provide meeting space for those who back the Democratic or
Republican Party, groups that advocate drug use and even the Ku
Klux Klan.
   ``Congress did not ask the school administrators to surrender
control of the schools,'' Sekulow replied. ``There is yet to be
that parade of horribles.''
   Justice Byron R. White said Sekulow's position was ``not very
illuminating,'' and said it might be a good idea to send the case
back to the lower courts for further study.
   Some organizations, such as the National School Boards
Association, have argued that the federal law is a thinly disguised
move to return prayer to the public schools. A 1962 high court
ruling banned organized, school-sponsored prayer sessions for
students.
   Students at Westside High sought recognition in 1985 of a
Christian Bible study club. Officials refused to approve it, and
suggested the students meet instead at a church next door.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year overruled a
federal judge, saying the club must be allowed to meet on school
premises.
   The justices ruled in 1981 that state-run universities cannot
ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious
worship and study. But the justices have never decided whether the
same rule should apply to public high schools.

   The evacuation was coordinated by the Royal Air Force.
   With weather conditions forcast to get worse Wednesday, all

   Actress Valerie Harper will return to weekly
television later this month in her own series, `City,' CBS
announced Tuesday.
   The new Monday comedy series, in which Harper plays a city
manager with a 19-year-old daughter, will go in the current time
slot of ``The Famous Teddy Z.'' CBS said that show will return in a
new time and date to be announced later.
   From 1974 to 1978, Harper starred in CBS' ``Rhoda,'' a spinoff
of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' From 1986 to the fall of 1987,
she starred on NBC's ``Valerie'' before quitting that show.
   Harper sued Lorimar Productions and was awarded $1.85 million in
damages and a share of the profits form the show, of which she was
part owner. A jury found that Lorimar had acted in bad faith in
firing her from ``Valerie.''
   Harper's new show begins Jan. 29.
   Her new show is the second prime-time change Jeff Sagansky has
made since last month, when he became president of CBS
Entertainment. Last week, he canceled a cult favorite, ``Beauty and
the Beast,'' effective Jan. 24.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian demonstrators demanding independence
for their republic confronted the visiting Kremlin ideology chief
Tuesday in a prelude to rallies planned for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
expected visit.
   ``You want to leave the Soviet Union?'' Vadim A. Medvedev asked
a crowd of protesters on the snowy square near Kaunas, Lithuania's
second largest city.
   A woman responded that she favored independence within the
framework of the Soviet federation of 15 republics.
   But Medvedev, in a scene broadcast on Soviet TV, repeated the
question and before receiving another answer, said, ``For being
independent, having rights, so that sovereignty was filled with
real content, we are for that, we aren't against that. We are for
that and that's what reforms are for.''
   But by his question and tone, he implied that the Moscow
leadership favored granting Lithuanians these rights as part of the
union and remained opposed to Lithuanian secession.
   Medvedev's visit to the Baltic republic is intended to help
defuse one of the most serious political crises facing Gorbachev.
On Dec. 20, the republic's Communist Party voted to rupture ties
with its national parent, the the first such break since the
Communists took power in Moscow in 1917.
   Lithuanians, who had their own country before Josef Stalin
annexed it in 1940 as part of a secret Nazi-Soviet treaty, are
making no secret that the next step is a complete political break
with Moscow.
   On Monday, Medvedev had told Lithuanian factory workers,
``Nobody is against independence. But let this be together with the
Soviet Communist Party.''
   Tuesday's encounter symbolized the showdown between the Kremlin
and the republic's 3.7 million people.
   A poster carried by protesters who greeted Medvedev at a
speaking engagement read, ``We are for an Independent Lithuania.''
   ``Separation of the party is only the first step toward
independence,'' said Kazimieras Motieka, a Lithuanian
representative in the Soviet legislature and leader of the Sajudis
political movement.
   Giant demonstrations are planned Wednesday and Thursday in the
republic's capital, Vilnius. The protests were originally timed to
coincide with a visit by Gorbachev, who hopes to bring Lithuanians
back into the fold.
   But Communist Party officials in Vilnius said Gorbachev was not
expected to arrive until Thursday at the earliest. Sajudis
spokesmen said they would still proceed with the demonstration,
even though Lithuanian Communist leaders had asked them to call it
off.
   The stakes for the visit are high, because the Lithuanian party
split could encourage others in the Soviet Union to follow suit.
Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev warned Monday of a ``domino
effect.''
   Wednesday's demonstration was scheduled in Cathedral Square, a
popular protest site in downtown Vilnius next to a Roman Catholic
cathedral.
   Thursday's protest was to include protesters from throughout the
republic, and Motieka predicted a turnount of hundreds of
thousands. Masses were planned Thursday evening.

   The president of Xerox Corp.'s French subsidiary
was shot and seriously wounded Tuesday at the end of a seven-hour
hostage drama in which he and four other employees were held at
gunpoint by a former employee.
   Olivier Groues, president of Rank Xerox-France, was in critical
condition from the gunshot wound to his right side, police said.
   Police took the gunman into custody immediately after the
shooting in the company's offices on the 20th floor of a skyscraper
in the La Defense business district of the western outskirts of
Paris.
   The gunman was identified as Daniel Vielle, who was said to be
seeking more money from his dismissal five years earlier.
   Vielle, 45, entered Rank Xerox-France's offices in the Bellini
Tower about noon, accosted Vice President Bernard Reibell and
forced him with three other hostages into Groues' office, police
said.
   Other company employees were evacuated as negotiations proceeded
through the afternoon, leading eventually to the freeing of all
hostages except Groues.

   The Energy Department will decide within the
next two weeks whether to build a smaller super collider
atom-smasher or to spend more to keep the giant machine as
originally envisioned, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday.
   Gramm said the Energy Department's High Energy Physics Advisory
Board would meet Friday to assess the impact of potential
reductions on the scientific capacity of the machine, which is to
be built in Ellis County south of Dallas.
   Meanwhile, the SSC Laboratory in DeSoto, Texas, which is under
contract to build the collider, is examining the cost of design
changes, Gramm said.
   Once both groups submit their findings next Tuesday to Energy
Secretary James Watkins, he is expected to decide what he will
propose to Congress by the end of the month, Gramm said after
meeting with Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore.
   Gramm said he still has no estimate of the extra cost needed to
buld the machine as originally planned, although a $1 billion
increase has been mentioned by some officials.
   The total cost of the accelerator had been estimated earlier at
$5.9 billion, expressed as the sum of annual expenditures by the
time operation begins in the late 1990s.
   ``My guess is there will be a compromise. We want to be sure
that we don't buy a Cadillac, that we buy a Chevrolet,'' Gramm said.
   As originally planned, the collider would be a 53-mile
underground tunnel in which beams of protons would be hurled into
each other at energies 20 times what is possible today.
   Gramm has said previously that one problem with the collider is
that the mechanism that would inject proton beams into the
underground ring, as originally planned, is too small for a 53-mile
oval.

   Record crowds are lining up to see an
exhibit featuring the exposed graves of prehistoric American
Indians before a state museum closes it next month.
   The burial grounds exhibit at the state-funded Dickson Mounds
Museum drew 3,412 visitors last weekend, or 10 times the normal
number for a Sunday in January, said Judith Franke, museum director.
   ``We had a pretty hectic weekend,'' Ms. Franke said Monday. ``We
had more people in one day than we had for the entire month of
January last year when our total attendance was 1,418.''
   Publicity about plans to close the exhibit of Indian skeletons
Feb. 1 sparked the surge in attendance, Ms. Franke said. The museum
draws 80,000 visitors a year.
   American Indian groups have been pressuring museums and
universities to return Indian remains for burial. Ms. Franke said
last week that the exhibit had not been the target of complaints or
protests but clearly was a ``living-on-borrowed-time sort of
thing.''
   The rest of the museum, 35 miles southwest of Peoria, will
remain open. Its main exhibit centers on the burial plot containing
the skeletons of 237 people who lived in the Illinois River valley
in Fulton County about 800 to 1,000 years ago.
   A musuem in Wickliffe, Ky., is also closing a similar Indian
burial exhibit which an official said has sparked local complaints
from Indian groups.
   ``Exhibiting human remains is not ethical or the most sensitive
thing to do and we intend to close our exhibit,'' said Kit Wesler,
director of the Wickliffe Mounds Research Center.

   Now here's a city that's not out to get
your goat.
   The City Council on Monday unanimously rejected a proposed
ordinance that would have limited the number of goats per back yard
and forced owners to keep them in cages at least 20 feet from a
neighbor's property line.
   The vote came after all 10 of the people who spoke at a public
hearing opposed the proposal, most saying goats make cleaner pets
than dogs or cats.
   Peter Wangsness, whose pygmy goats prompted the complaints which
led city officials to draft the proposal, said he was happy about
the vote.
   Wangsness said he hadn't heard from the neighbor who complained
about the goats since a city judge threw out the man's
criminal-nuisance complaint last fall.
   Wangsness testified that both NASA and the planners of Biosphere
II, a self-sufficient, sealed environment in which scientists plan
to spend two years, much like a long space flight, picked goats as
an ideal domestic animal for space travel.

<TEXT>
   A right-wing West German political party
denounced as ``neo-Nazis'' by the East German government said it
will organize for East German elections and predicted Tuesday it
would get 10 percent of the vote.
   Also Tuesday, East German Environment Minister Hans Reichelt
resigned following opposition attacks that the country's former
hard-line Communist leaders turned it into one of the most polluted
nations in Europe. The official East German news agency ADN gave no
reason for Reichelt's resignation.
   In West Berlin, the top figure in an East German financial
scandal, Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, was freed after a
prosecutor doubted that he could get a fair trial in East Germany.
   The government of Communist Prime Minister Hans Modrow has
promised elections May 6, but it has vowed to keep West Germany's
Republican Party from organizing, saying that the right-wing
extemist group is a neo-Nazi organization.
   But the Republican Party chief, Franz Schoenhuber, told a news
conference in West Berlin that the Republicans would soon set up
electoral groups throughout East Germany.
   ``We will find ways and means to get tons of campaign material
into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany),'' said
Schoenhuber, a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier.
   While Schoenhuber predicted a result of at least 10 percent in
May, other party leaders say it could be 15 percent.
   Either figure, if it were to be reached, would give the
Republicans a prominent role among the factions jockeying for
control of East Germany.
   Carsten Pagel, the Republicans' spokesman in West Berlin, said
100 East Germans had signed up as members of the party.
   East Germany's Communists have warned of an alleged threat from
right-wing extremists, but opposition leaders say they are
exaggerating the threat in a bid to remain in power and take
advantage of opposition infighting.
   Thousands of Communists have resigned from the party since
demonstrations forced the resignation of hard-line leader Erich
Honecker in October. But the party still controls the media, key
meeting places and supplies of such essentials as paper. The
Communists have been accused of unfairly exploiting that power.
   In West Berlin, prosecutor Dietrich Schultz said
Schalck-Golodkowski had been released Tuesday because West German
officials see no grounds for prosecuting him.
   Schalck-Golodkowski, who turned himself in to West Berlin
authorities Dec. 6, is wanted in East Germany on embezzlement
charges and for allegedly overseeing a ring selling weapons to
countries in South America, Africa and the Middle East.
   Schalck-Golodkowski, the former chief foreign trader under
Honecker, had said he repaid $31 million to East Germany from Swiss
bank accounts, but that is only a small part of what East Germany's
official news media claim he had embezzled.
   In other developments:
   _ The former No. 2 official of East Germany's government-run
labor federation was found dead in her East Berlin apartment, the
union said. West Germany's Bild newspaper claimed that Johanna
Toepfer had committed suicide over the weekend. She and the rest of
the union leadership had been forced to resign in disgrace last
month amid democratic reforms.
   _ An East German newspaper reported that six Olympic champions
and several East German national team stars have joined foreign
clubs legally since the country opened its borders in November.
   Under the headline ``Our Christmas Sale,'' the newspaper Junge
Welt published a list of the players, who included four Olympic
cycling champions, handball player Wieland Schmidt and weightlifter
Joachim Kunz. The list did not include several soccer and handball
players who emigrated to West Germany without official permission.
   Since the political changes and the opening of East Germany's
borders, a number of East German stars have been allowed to go
abroad in return for badly needed foreign currency.
   _ Former East German Communist leader Egon Krenz has been
stripped of his last remnant of public office, a parliament seat,
ADN said.
   ADN published a brief statement by Krenz saying he resigned from
the People's Chamber ``at the wish of my party's leadership.''
   Krenz replaced Honecker last Oct. 18 after 18 years as Communist
Party chief, but he resigned from that and other leadership posts
only six weeks later under popular pressure.
   The statement carried by ADN gave no indications of Krenz's
future plans.

   American schoolchildren are ``dreadfully
inadequate'' in the two basic tools of learning _ reading and
writing, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said Tuesday in
releasing results of two nationwide studies.
   The Nation's Report Card, conducted in 1988 by the federally
funded National Assessment of Educational Progress, said overall,
reading and writing performance of students aged 9, 13 and 17
remained virtually unchanged since the last assessment was reported
in 1984.
   The report found only ``subtle changes in reading performance at
the national level'' since the first reading assessment in 1971.
There was no improvement in an already-low writing performance.
   ``As a nation, we should be appalled that we have placed our
children in such jeopardy,'' Cavazos told reporters. ``The reading
and writing skills of American students remain dreadfully
inadequate.''
   ``Reading and writing are the basic tools of learning, the crux
of the academic enterprise. Without solid literacy skills we can
never expect to see improvements in math or science, history or
geography. And the costs will be staggering,'' he said.
   The National Education Association said the findings ``offer
national education goal setters some important food for thought.''
The Educational Testing Service said the results warrant attention
from all policy leaders, educators, and parents.
   National Assessment or NAEP uses five levels of reading
proficiency to define students' reading skills and strategies:
rudimentary, basic, intermediate, adept and advanced.
   Key findings in the reading report were:
   _Since 1980, the percentage of 9-year-olds with basic reading
skills _ the ability to understand specific or sequentially related
information _ has declined from 68 to 63 percent. Seven percent
lack rudimentary skills required to carry out simple reading tasks.
   _Forty-two percent of all 13-year-olds lack the skills needed to
read at the next highest level, which calls for the ability to
interrelate ideas and make generalizations. Although black
13-year-olds have made steady improvements in acquiring these
skills, 61 percent are still unable to read at the intermediate
level.
   _The percentage of 17-year-olds reading at the intermediate
level has increased steadily _ from 81 percent in 1980 to 86
percent in 1988.
   _Nearly 6 out of 10 _ 58 percent _ of 17-year-olds cannot read
at the adept level, which is defined as the ability to find,
understand, summarize, and explain relatively complicated
information.
   _Less than 5 percent of the nation's 17-year-olds are reading at
the advanced level, which includes skills needed to understand
scientific materials, literary essays, historical documents, and
materials generally found in professional and technical work
environments. In 1971, nearly 7 percent were reading at the
advanced level.
   ``The overall picture suggests a nation of students who were
reading better than their counterparts did in 1971, but it must be
emphasized that the progress is slight and could be short-lived,''
the report said.
   The report said the gains for 17-year-olds may be ``partially a
legacy of progress made by these students when they were age 9.''
   ``Unfortunately, 9-year-olds born more recently have shown a
pattern of small but steady declines during the 1980s, perhaps
foreshadowing similar declines at ages 13 and 17 in the years ahead
as these students move through our educational system.''
   The ``Writing Report Card'' tested about 18,000 students in
grades four, eight and 11 on their ability to write informative,
persuasive and imaginative pieces.
   The key result was that the levels of writing performance in
1988 appeared to be substantially the same as in 1974. Many
students continued to perform at minimal levels on the writing
assessment tasks, and relatively few performed at adequate or
better levels.
   According to the report, in both 1984 and 1988, females were
better writers than males at all grade levels. Black students
improved slightly in some categories of written English, such as
punctuation and sentence structure.
   Finally, the report said the fondness for writing declined with
age _ 55 percent of fourth graders said they liked to write,
compared with 42 percent of eighth graders and 37 percent of 11th
graders.
   ``The key impact of today's reports is that they stress the need
for us to redouble our efforts to ensure that every student masters
the basics of reading and writing,'' said NEA Vice President Bob
Chase, adding teachers need to spend more time with smaller groups
of students.

<HEAD>National Gallery Solves Italian Whodunit of Bellini Masterpiece</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After four years of detective work, the
National Gallery of Art said Tuesday it had solved a major whodunit
in the history of art by fingering an obscure Italian painter as
responsible for mysterious alterations in Giovanni Bellini's
masterpiece, ``The Feast of the Gods.''
   David Bull, the gallery's chief of painting conservation, said
an exhaustive laboratory analysis shows that Bellini's 475-year-old
work was repainted not only by his former pupil, Titian, but by
Dosso Dossi, court painter to Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara.
   Previously it was known that ``The Feast of the Gods'' had
undergone two drastic alterations within 15 years after Bellini
completed the large canvas in 1514, but art scholars long assumed
that Titian was responsible for both changes.
   Bull said Tuesday that his study yielded the ``big discovery''
that Dosso, rather than Titian, was responsible for the first
alteration in which a major portion of the landscape background was
repainted.
   Bull's other major discovery was that, in contrast to what
scholars once thought, Titian had never tampered with Bellini's
figures in the painting, a mythological scene of gods, goddesses
and satyrs enjoying a forest bacchanal.
   Left unanswered, says Bull, is the question of why the Bellini
painting was altered at all.
   Previous assumptions about the mysteries of ``The Feast of the
Gods'' were based largely on a 1956 study of the painting by John
Walker, then director of the National Gallery. Bull said Walker's
analysis was flawed because the painting was obscured by centuries
of grime and yellowing varnish.
   When the painting was removed from the National Gallery's
permanent exhibition in 1985, Bull carefully cleaned the surface
before beginning a detailed study using X-rays, high-powered
microscopes, infrared light beams and enlarged photographs of tiny
cross-sections of pigment.
   By comparing portions of the work with the style and brushwork
of other Dosso paintings, Bull concluded that the court painter was
responsible for the initial repainting of Bellini's work. He found
that two Dosso additions _ a pheasant and some of the background
foliage _ were left intact by Titian.
   Bull said his conclusions won the unanimous endorsement of a
panel of art scholars who studied the results of his work for four
days last March.
   Restored to its appearance in 1529, when Titian completed his
alterations, the painting will return to public display this Sunday
until the end of April.
   In May, ``The Feast of the Gods'' will return to Venice, Italy,
for the first time since Bellini completed the painting, to take
its place in a major exhibition of Titian's works opening in June.
That show will open at the National Gallery in October.
   ``This is the only painting in existence that combines the work
of Bellini, perhaps the leading painter of the 15th century, and
Titian, the artistic genius of the 16th century, on the same
canvas,'' Bull said. ``That's what makes it so extraordinary. In
one painting you are virtually spanning two centuries of art.''
   The Ferrara duke's family treasures were dispersed at the end of
the 16th century, and ``The Feast of the Gods'' passed through
several private collections until the last owner, Joseph Widener of
Philadelphia, gave it to the National Gallery in 1942.

   A Northwest Airlines spokesman said Tuesday
the lavatory of a Boeing 727 that dropped an engine over Florida
last week had been repaired eight times in the weeks leading to the
incident, which officials believe was linked to a leak in the
sanitary system.
   ``Our records show that the lav(atory) was repaired eight times
in the six weeks preceding the accident,'' said airline spokesman
Doug Miller from Northwest headquarters in St. Paul, Minn.
   Federal inspectors were in Atlanta, examining the lavatory and
fallen engine from the plane.
   Northwest's Flight 5, from Miami to Minneapolis, made an
emergency landing in Tampa after the aircraft lost power. The
pilots later learned that the right engine, one of three, had
fallen off the plane at 35,000 feet above ground.
   None of the 139 passengers or six crew members were injured.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the lavatory
had been repaired 10 times since November 1989.
   ``We're in the same ballpark,'' said Miller, adding that the
number of repairs is unusual. But Miller said that the problems had
been repaired each time to the company's satisfaction, that the
jetliner flew a number of flights between repairs and that ``it
wasn't the same identical problem each time.''
   Miller acknowledged, however, that all the problems had to do
with the blue fluid used to flush the toilets.
   Miller had earlier said the number of lavatory repairs was
closer to ``five or six times,'' but said the figure was revised
after consultation with Northwest's executive in charge of
maintenance.
   Officials theorize that the blue fluid leaked from the lavatory
and may have frozen at higher altitudes, broken free and been
hurled into the engine. The liquid would have caused the engine to
vibrate and break off, they theorize, because engines on 727s are
supposed to break free to avoid damaging the frame when they
vibrate badly.
   ``We intend to dismantle that lavatory tank and see what the
problem is and talk to the people who repaired it last,'' spokesman
Ted Lopatkiewicz of the National Transportation Safety Board said.
   Andrew Alston of the NTSB's Miami regional office traveled
Monday to Atlanta and was expected to spend a couple of days on the
examination, said regional director George Prellezo.
   Prellezo said the investigation was ``very simple'' and findings
indicate the problem is limited. ``We don't have a problem with all
the airplanes,'' he said.
   Miller said he could not discuss the specific repairs, saying
the company would leave it up to the NTSB to evaluate the record.
   As recently as 1985, engines broke off 727s in flight, and in
each case the problem was traced to a leaking lavatory. As a
result, the FAA in 1986 ordered airlines to inspect lavatory valves
in 727s every 200 flight hours or replace them with sturdier valves.
   Newer 727s have redesigned lavatory valves that are less likely
to leak.

<HEAD>US Says Leaks Hampering Drug Consultations with Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

   The Bush administration said Tuesday that
leaks about a proposed anti-drug interdiction effort off the
Colombian coast have complicated U.S. hopes of enlisting Colombia's
cooperation in the initiative.
   Word of the proposed U.S. deployment off the Colombian coast has
touched off rumors around the hemisphere that the United States
might try to blockade Colombia or perhaps even invade it as a
followup to the U.S. ouster last month of Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has been pondering options for
more extensive use of the military in the anti-drug campaign and is
expected to make recommendations to President Bush.
   Defense Department sources said that the aircraft carrier John
F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction effort off
Colombia but that final decisions about when the warship may be
deployed haven't been made yet.
   The carrier and an accompanying guided missile cruiser, the USS
Virginia, left Norfolk, Va., Thursday to engage in routine training
exercises in the Atlantic, officials have said.
   But the officials added that a question remained as to when and
if the warships would see duty in the proposed interdiction effort.
Colombian officials reportedly refused to meet with a U.S. team
sent to Bogota last week to discuss the subject.
   Asked whether the furor in Colombia has left the administration
embarrassed, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said,
``We're not embarrassed but it certainly has complicated the
consultation process.''
   The U.S. isolation in the hemisphere was underscored Monday,
when the Organization of American States voted 19-0 in support of a
resolution calling the penetration last month by U.S. troops of the
Nicaraguan ambassador's residence in Panama a violation of
international law.
   Another complicating factor for U.S. diplomats was the decision
by U.S. troops to surround the residence of the Peruvian ambassador
to Panama where government officials said two of Noriega's former
associates reportedly have taken refuge. Peruvian officials have
denied that the men were inside the building.
   The officials are worried about a nationalistic reaction in
Peru, whose president, Alan Garcia, is one of three Andean leaders
scheduled to attend next month's four-nation anti-drug summit with
Bush in Colombia. The others are the presidents of Colombia and
Bolivia.
   Garcia reacted angrily to the U.S. invasion of Panama and has
said he may not attend the summit if the American troops are still
there by the time of the summit.

   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first place in the ratings in a holiday week in which none of
the post-season football bowl games made the Nielsen Top 10.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote'' were back near the top as the ratings began
to return to normal.
   Football dominated the ratings during the previous week. This
ratings period the top-ranked game was NBC's coverage of Colorado
and Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. It tied for 12th place.
   The spill over into prime time of NBC's coverage of the AFL
professional playoff between Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher
rating, but was not included on the official Nielsen list. NBC and
CBS put it in 12th place in their version of the list and the
Orange Bowl tied for 13th. ABC did not count the pro game in its
list.
   CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a one-hour special episode
with guest star Dolly Parton and the birth of Charlene's baby, was
No. 10.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week ended Jan. 7
by a wide margin and CBS took over second place again from ABC. The
network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS 13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point
represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television
homes tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8. ABC
is second with 12.9 and CBS is third with 12.2.
   Here's the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied, CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the NBC miniseries ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' did not do nearly as well. The opening episode of
the three-part show was in a three-way tie for 34th.
   Two new series had premieres last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's how the other bowl games fared: ABC's Rose Bowl tied for
28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' tied for
43rd place.
   CBS took first place among the evening news shows away from ABC
for the week. ABC fell to second place by a tenth of a point. ``The
CBS Evening News'' was on five days last week, while ABC and NBC
did not have Monday shows. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC
11.0.
   The lowest-rated show was ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.'' Here
are the five bottom network shows: ABC's ``Saturday Night With
Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Life Goes On,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,''
ABC's Sugar Bowl, ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.''

   A former nursing assistant with AIDS who
confessed killing seven elderly patients, then said the confessions
were bogus, pleaded guilty Tuesday to murdering one of those
patients and was sentenced to life.
   Jeffrey Feltner, 27, who has said he gave bogus confessions to
draw attention to poor conditions in nursing homes, pleaded guilty
to first-degree murder in the death of a 75-year-old woman after
prosecutors played recordings of his previous statements about the
deaths.
   ``Feltner heard his taped confessions and after hearing the
evidence entered a plea of guilty,'' said assistant state attorney
David Damore.
   A jury had been seated for his trial just the day before.
   Feltner confessed numerous times during a year-long
investigation of the seven suspicious retirement home deaths,
police said, adding that the victims were smothered.
   Feltner was sentenced to life with a mandatory minimum of 25
years.
   He could have faced the death penalty if convicted of
first-degree murder in February 1988 of a 75-year-old resident of
the New Life Acres retirement home in Melrose, a North Florida city
20 miles west of Palatka.
   ``It was an excellent and wise move on his behalf,'' said
Feltner's attorney, Howard Pearl. ``But he denies killing anyone.
His statements would have damaged him. I felt it was time for
damage control.''
   Feltner still faces murder charges in nearby Volusia County in
the death of an 83-year-old woman and attorneys were trying to work
out a plea in that case.
   Prosecutors did not press charges in the remaining five deaths;
in four of those cases the bodies had already been cremated.
   Asked the motive for the killings, Damore replied: ``You would
have to ask Jeffrey Feltner. Obviously you have a person with a
very troubled mind.''
   Pearl said Feltner has acquired immune deficiency syndrome and
is receiving treatments with the drug AZT.
   ``He wants to be treated for AIDS,'' said Pearl. ``He wants to
recover his health.''
   After he was arrested last summer and charged with killing a
Volusia County patient, Feltner wrote a letter to his father and
stepmother in Michigan explaining that he had not killed anyone,
but had devised a plan that would help officials notice poor
nursing-home conditions.
   ``I wanted to spend what time I have left to do something that
everyone would be proud of but like always, I messed up,'' Feltner
wrote.
   ``When I went to work in the nursing homes and saw the abuse
they were getting I told myself that I would try and help them,''
he wrote. ``Everything I tried to do did not work so I had to say
that I killed some people, hoping that they would see the abuse
that they were getting.''
   Feltner's father and stepmother, Kasper and Norma Feltner of
Michigan, have said they believe he is innocent.

<HEAD>Freeze Reduces Acreage for Harvest in Florida, Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The freezing Christmas weather that ripped
into winter vegetable areas of Florida and Texas sharply reduced
acreage to be harvested for broccoli, celery, lettuce and tomatoes,
according to an Agriculture Department report Tuesday.
   Overall, farmers are expected to have about 191,000 acres of
seven selected winter vegetables for harvest this season, down 8
percent from a year ago, the report said.
   No production estimates were given in the report.
   In Texas, for example, no carrots are expected to be harvested,
although carrot acreage is up in California and Florida.
   Celery for harvest in Florida is down 14 percent from a year
ago, however, and the sweet corn acreage was reported down by 35
percent. The Texas lettuce acreage was reported to be cut 79
percent from last winter, while the Florida tomato acreage is down
32 percent.
   But the Florida harvest of winter strawberries is expected to be
from 5,400 acres, up 2 percent from last year.
   ``Growers saved most plants from the Christmas weekend freeze by
forming ice caps on plants with overhead sprinklers,'' the report
said. ``The freeze will lower yields because fewer pickings will be
made. Virtually all plants are expected to survive if temperatures
remain moderate for the next few weeks.''
   Looking at the carrot situation, most of Florida's crop was
destroyed, although growers ``are expected to replant most, if not
all, of the lost acreage,'' the report said. Part of the severely
damaged crop in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas may be salvaged by
hand harvesting ``if the price is high enough.''
   Department analysts have said that while citrus and fresh
vegetable prices are expected to rise in the first quarter, overall
consumer food prices in 1990 are still expected to go up a modest 3
percent to 5 percent, compared with an average of 5.7 percent in
1989, the sharpest gain since 1981.
   One reason is that vegetable fields can be replanted quickly so
that there's a minimum lag in supplies, they said.
   In a related report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said Florida vegetable farmers enjoyed warm weather in
major producing areas during the week of Dec. 31-Jan. 6.
   ``Planting and replanting was active under nearly ideal weather
conditions,'' the report said. ``Harvest continued, but supplies of
most crops were reduced.''
   The joint facility, which is operated by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments, said freeze damage in Texas ``became more
evident'' in the Rio Grande Valley. ``Lettuce and celery were
severely damaged, and onions also suffered some loss,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Panamanians celebrated
the downfall of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega at a memorial Mass
Tuesday, and about 150 others marched in the first anti-American
demonstration since the Dec. 20 invasion.
   Both events commemorated the Day of the Martyrs, a national
holiday in memory of 23 Panamanians who died in anti-American riots
in 1964.
   The throng of 8,000 at the outdoor Mass in suburban El Dorado
were more in a mood to celebrate than to mourn the dead, shouting
``Viva Panama!'' as priests, nuns and religious workers asked
``Jesus to guide me and help me build the new society.''
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath presided before an audience that used
colorful umbrellas to protect themselves from a hot morning sun
followed by rain. Those attending included President Guillermo
Endara, first and second vice presidents Ricardo Arias Calderon and
Guillermo Ford and papal nuncio Sebastian Laboa.
   ``The hatred and rancor sown in the past cannot and should not
characterize the future,'' said McGrath in his homily, dubbing the
day one of ``Reconciliation, Conversion and Recontruction.''
   Meanwhile, about 150 people held the first demonstration against
the U.S. Army assault, gathering at Santa Teresa church in Maranon,
a low-income neighborhood less than a mile from Noriega's former
Defense Headquarters, for a Mass celebrated by six priests,
including three Americans.
   ``Endara, Arias Calderon and Ford will be remembered by future
Panamanian generations as oligarchs in the service of a foreign
power,'' said a pamphlet distributed by the tiny Socialist Workers
Party, which opposed Noriega the six years he was in power.
   The marchers included university students and labor leaders who
said they had also opposed Noriega but condemned ``the savage
Yankee invasion that cut an open wound in our national
sovereignty.''
   Noriega often presented himself as Panama's defender against
U.S. aggression and representative of a generation with a mission
to gain control of the Panama Canal, which will be taken over by
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The Day of the Martyrs commemorates one of the flashpoints of
Panamanian nationalism, the Jan. 9, 1964 riots that left 23
Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers dead. The riots began in a
dispute over whether the Panamanian flag should fly at Balboa High
School.
   ``It's a day of profound deep thought so none of these things
happen ever again,'' second vice president Ford told a reporter.
   U.S. troops searching for Noriega henchmen continued to surround
several embassies including the Peruvian ambassador's residence,
where Peru said it granted diplomatic asylum to a top Noriega
security aide and 11 others.
   The security aide, Capt. Gonzalo Gonzalez, was granted asylum
along with Noriega's secretary, Capt. Marcela Tason; his top press
spokesman, Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo, and Maj. Heraclides Sucre,
a commander of the elite Battalion 2000.
   Peruvian charge d'affairs Luis Sandiga denied Panamanian charges
that the residence was sheltering Lt. Col. Luis ``Papo'' Cordova,
one of Noriega's most-wanted associates.
   The only security at the El Dorado Mass was a handful of
bodyguards around the new Panamanian leaders, while dozens of
unarmed firemen and young men and women from the Scouts of Panama
cordoned off the crowd with ropes.
   Under huge Panamanian and Vatican flags, about 80 priests donned
white robes over blue jeans to assist McGrath in communion.
   The archbishop, presiding from a podium in front of a looted
dress shop stacked with undressed mannequins, asked those who
plundered stores throughout Panama City to return the goods, make
financial amends or provide community service.
   ``Do it,'' he said. ``Take it upon your soul to remove that
stain from your home, community and your conscience.''
   ``We are all a little to blame for all the evil which befell
us,'' said McGrath. ``Everyone should recognize that in their
hearts. If we don't do that, the errors of the past will be
repeated.''
   The dozens gathered for the protest marched 20 blocks in silence
to the Amador cemetery, near the joint U.S.-Panamanian installation
at Fort Amador, where some of the 1964 victims are buried.
   The Rev. Jose Luis Medina said Panamanians were ``confused'' and
that's why they were celebrating the American invasion. ``We must
accompany these people, be patient with them,'' he said.
   The Rev. Diego Caffley, a Philadelphian who has been in Panama
17 years, said Panamanians should ``help recreate true nationalism,
not the phony nationalism of the old regime.''
   The crowd waved Panamanian flags and banners reading ``The
Fatherland is in Mourning,'' and broke up after about 10 minutes at
the cemetery.
   At the huge El Dorado Mass, Panamanians waved white lace
handkerchiefs in the rain and sang the national anthem as the Mass
ended.
   Asked if he forgave Noriega and the Dignity Battalion henchmen
who beat him after the May 7 presidential election, Ford said:
``Look I'm a Catholic and if you repent, I forgive. But I don't
Know if Mr. Noriega has repented.''
   Noriega, imprisoned in Miami, faces U.S. drug trafficking
charges that carry penalties totaling 145 years in jail.
   Officials say about 600 Panamanian soldiers and civilians died
during the U.S. invasion that ousted Noriega. Twenty-three U.S.
soldiers also died in the invasion.

   The president of the National Urban League
said Tuesday that reduced East-West tensions represent a ``narrow
window of opportunity'' to switch military dollars to help blacks,
whose economic progress was stalled during the military buildup of
the 1980s.
   Government and business leaders should use the money to develop
an urban Marshall Plan and investment bank to help close the
economic gap between whites and blacks and ensure American
competitiveness in the 21st century, said league president, John E.
Jacob, as the civil rights group released its annual assessment on
the status of black Americans.
   Jacob said in the overview of the report that ``the state of
black America remains critical,'' despite a year of hope that began
with a new administration and ended with changing world conditions
that might shift national concern and resources to domestic issues,
   ``At a time when we hear policymakers talk of a new Marshall
Plan and a new economic development bank for eastern Europe, we
need to press for an urban Marshall Plan and an urban investment
bank that invests in our own people and in our own cities,'' Jacob
said at a news conference.
   The plan would be aimed at bringing ``the people at the margins
of our society into the mainstream to become producers in a
productive society,'' Jacob said.
   Jacob said money for the plan could come from cutting the $300
billion defense budget in half to $150 billion.
   He said a government investment of $50 billion to help
minorities rise would demonstrate a ``national will and
commitment.'' He recommended using $100 billion to reduce the
federal deficit.
   President Bush has said that if there is a ``peace dividend'' it
will go to lowering the federal deficit and not to expanding social
programs. And he told high school students in Denver on Dec. 8 that
the notion that Congress might make ``drastic slashes in the
defense budget and then take the money in what's called a peace
dividend'' was ``crazy.''
   ``I will not acquiesce in that,'' Bush said.
   ``The Eastern European change is very exciting and can lead,
through arms control agreements, to agreed lower levels of
defense,'' Bush said then. ``Even though that's happening, I think
it would be imprudent to make reckless cuts in our defense.''
   Previous League reports decried efforts to dismantle social
programs in the Reagan era and spoke of increased racism in the
1980s, but Jacob said increased access to the Bush administration
made him optimistic about government response to his organization's
new recommendations.
   ``We spent $2 trillion in the past ten years on defense because
we were locked into a wartime mentality that now has no basis in
fact,'' said Jacob, citing recent events in East Europe.
   ``The end of the Cold War must mean the start of a renewed drive
to bring America into the 21st century by investing in its people
and its economy,'' he added.
   The League's urban Marshall plan would include emphasis on
developing effective education, jobs and training, health care and
housing programs for minorities and women. Jacob said minority and
female workers would make up the largest portion of new workers
during the 1990s.
   The original Marshall Plan was a U.S. aid program that helped
Europe recover from the devastation of World War II.
   The country's need for more skilled and technologically adept
workers to compete in current global markets represents an
opportunity for blacks, said Jacob, who warned that others might
support efforts to import workers from elsewhere.
   ``America simply will not be able to compete with the Japanese
and the Europeans unless America develops the human resources, and
the only ones we currently have are those who are being squandered
among the minorities,'' he said.
   Jacob did not offer specifics for the plan, but included in the
League's report, ``The State of Black America _ 1990,'' are 12
chapters of discussions on such topics as recent Supreme Court
civil rights decisions, black-on-black crime and the election of
the nation's first black governor, L. Douglas Wilder in Virginia.
   Jacob said U.S. businesses also had a vested interest in black
educational and economic progress, citing a recent incident
involving a New York firm that was forced to test 57,000 people
before the company found 2,000 people qualified for jobs it needed
to fill.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Reports Massacre Of At Least 200 Liberians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 200 Liberian civilians were massacred
in northern Liberia, and eyewitnesses fleeing the country attribute
the killings to government forces, a human rights group reported
Tuesday.
   The killings are the result of a Dec. 24 attempt to topple
President Samuel K. Doe, according to Africa Watch. The
organization is a division of the private Human Rights Watch that
monitors abuses around the world.
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of neighboring Ivory Coast
reported that between 8,000 and 10,000 Liberians fled into his
country in recent days, the group said.
   ``Africa Watch has also received reports of a shoot-to-kill
policy instituted by President Doe, who has instructed troops
fighting rebel forces to shoot on sight any persons engaged in
suspicious activities,'' the organization said.
   Its statement also said three Liberian villages along the border
with the Ivory Coast _ Kahnplay, Boutuo and Lepulah _ were
destroyed in the fighting.
   Doe, a former army sergeant who seized power in a 1980 coup,
told a rally in Monrovia on Saturday that government troops were
searching for more rebels. He ordered his countrymen to turn in the
dissidents, whom he said were based in the Ivory Coast.
   This is the second coup attempt against Doe in four years,
although he has accused opponents of plotting additional overthrows
which he foiled. Critics say he concocted some of the alleged plots
in order to eliminate rivals.
   The State Department said it did not have any information or
comment about the coup attempt and the reported killings.
   Human Rights Watch last week accused the Bush administration of
failing to use its leverage with Doe to speak out against his
violations.
   Liberia, founded by former American slaves in the 19th century,
is the largest recipient of U.S. aid per capita in sub-Saharan
Africa and a strategic ally of the United States.
   It is the only nation in western Africa that allows U.S.
military planes to refuel, and the administration's Voice of
America has transmitters there. ``We believe such factors cannot
justify funding and silently condoning abuses by the Liberian
government,'' said Human Right Watch.

   Foreign ministers Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey and Boiko
Dimitrov of Bulgaria ended a second session of talks on the rights
of ethnic Turkish Moslems in Bulgaria and said a joint communique
would be issued Wednesday.
   Neither minister would say much about Tuesday's meeting, nor
would officials from Kuwait, which is mediating the dispute.
   However, sources close to the talks said Turkey seemed inclined
to accept as sufficient redress the new Bulgarian government's
reversal of the assimilation campaign pursued by ousted Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dimitrov
gave assurances the new administration in Sofia would not yield to
pressure of widespread demonstrations in Bulgaria against the
reversal.
   They implied that the issue of more than 300,000 ethnic Turks
who fled Bulgaria last year and sought refuge in Turkey now was
going to be left as an issue between Turkey and the refugees. Some
have been returning after the new Bulgarian decisions, but many
have so far preferred to remain in Turkey.
   Under the assimilation policy, ethnic Turks could not speak
their mother tongue or practice the Moslem religion and were forced
to adopt Bulgarian names.
   ``The two ministers conducted in a constructive and frank spirit
a detailed and comprehensive review of the relations between
Bulgaria and Turkey and means of normalizing these relations in the
future,'' their brief statement said.
   It said the two ministers on Tuesday ``also expresed their
government's desire to improve their relations on a sound basis of
mutual benefit with a view to reaching better understanding.''
   The statement said both sides would hold a meeting toward this
end at the opening session of an international ``open atmosphere''
conference in Ottawa on Feb. 22-25.
   During a break in the working sessions, Yilmaz and Dimitrov
described the talks as positive, but gave no details.
   The first round of talks under Kuwaiti auspices were held in
October.
   At that time, Turkey pressed for guaranteed rights of the
refugees as well as the rest of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria.
It also sought a settlement of the refugee problem within its
borders, possibly with the financial help of other Moslem countries.
   Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed of Kuwait inaugurated the
second session at Bayan Palace, eight miles south of the city
center. Kuwait is involved as president of the 46-member
Organization of the Islamic Conference.
   In another development Tuesday, Bulgaria's ambassador in
Britain, Dimitar Zhulev, said his government will hold an inquiry
into the 1978 murder of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian emigre believed
to have been murdered in London by a poisoned umbrella.
   Zhulev told Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave that
Markov had been reinstated as a posthumous member of the Union of
Bulgarian Writers that restored his professional status.
   British investigators concluded that Markov, who worked for the
British Broadcasting Corp.'s Bulgarian service, was killed by
poison injected through an umbrella tip as he waited for a bus on
Sept. 29, 1978.
   ``I think that this really has to be cleared up before we can
see a new Bulgaria because it is a stain on its reputation,''
Markov's widow, Annabel, said in an interview with BBC-TV.
   Mrs. Markov has gone to Bulgaria seeking more information on the
case.
   Waldegrave, a personal friend of the Markovs, last month asked
Bulgarian authorities to open up the books on the case.

<HEAD>Results for 1990 Integra, Lumina and Eclipse Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drivers of the 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse
hatchback and Chevrolet Lumina sedan run a ``possible'' risk of
head injury in a collision, federal safety officials said.
   No comparable risk was found for drivers of the 1990 Acura
Integra sedan, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
also said. The risk of head injury to passengers was less than
probable. So was the risk of chest injury to drivers and
passengers, also when data were available.
   NHTSA's report Monday on crash tests of the three vehicles was
the first for the 1990 model year under the New Car Assessment
Program.
   The vehicles were tested by driving them head-on into a fixed
barrier, creating the same conditions as a head-on collision
between two identical vehicles at 35 miles an hour.
   The test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and,
in certain cars, air bags. The tests are conducted using dummies
that represent an average-sized adult male.
   According to the NHTSA index, a score of 750 or lower means head
injury is unlikely; 750-1,250 means head injury is possible; and
anything higher means head injury is likely.
   Chest injury numbers above 60 indicate that chest injury is
likely.
   The lower any of the numbers, the lower the potential for
injury. But for purposes of comparison vehicles have to be of the
same type and weigh within 500 pounds of each other.
   The Integra and Eclipse are both light vehicles in the
2,500-2,999 pound range. The Integra had a driver head injury
rating of 585, passenger head injury rating of 637 and a passenger
chest injury rating of 42. No information was available on driver
chest injuries.
   The Lumina, which rates as a heavy vehicle at 3,632 pounds, had
a driver head injury rating of 1,200, with no data on passenger
head injuries. The driver chest injury rating was 58, and there was
no data on passenger chest injuries.
   The report marks the first time the agency categorized vehicles
by weight, specified the occupant protection system and used the
categories ``unlikely,'' ``possible,'' or ``likely.''

   Educators concerned with the plight of
minority students offered Tuesday a wide-ranging plan to
restructure American education, including one proposal to stop
grouping elementary school students by age.
   ``Improving education is the most important challenge facing
America if we are to maintain our ability to compete in the world
and sustain our standard of living,'' said Ray Marshall, former
secretary of labor who is chairman of the Action Council, a part of
the Quality Education for Minorities Project.
   ``With minorities comprising 70 percent of the enrollment in the
top (largest) 25 U.S. school districts and 40 percent of the new
entrants into the work force over the next decade, it is clear that
success in the education of minorities is synonymous with continued
economic success for America,'' said Marshall, a professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.
   The QEM Project, which is based at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and directed by Shirley McBay, dean for Student
Affairs at MIT, is funded by a $1.2 million grant from the Carnegie
Corp. Fifty-eight major changes are recommended for the nation's
educational system.
   The entire list of recommendations would cost billions of
dollars and officials estimate it would require $37 billion alone
for one recommendation, that each student attend school for 12
straight months every three years.
   Key recommendations contained in the group's national study,
``Education That Works,'' would ``radically transform'' elementary
and middle-school education so that students no longer compete with
their peers but work more in groups and teams.
   Project officials describe the study and the ``action plan'' as
the ``first comprehensive, national strategy prepared by and for
minority Americans to improve the entire educational system.''
   More than two years were spent gathering information that
reflect the experience and ideas of five minority groups _ Alaska
Natives, American Indians, Afro-Americans, Mexican-Americans and
Puerto Ricans.
   One recommendation was to eliminate the practice of grouping
students by their abilities and their ages while in elementary
school.
   ``Many alert and curious minority youngsters arrive in
kindergarten eager to learn, yet are channelled into school
structures that sap their curiosity and numb their minds,'' said
the report. ``By the third grade, they begin to fall behind and may
be at a grave disadvantage educationally before they leave
elementary school.''
   Instead, the study called for a system of grouping and grading
students based on their mastery of specific skills, or combination
of skills.
   ``This approach lends itself particularly well to cooperative
learning and team teaching,'' the report said.
   Middle schools, the report said, should be redesigned into small
learning communities ``so that minority students would have the
opportunity to establish key relationships with teachers and other
adults who can help the youngsters foster belief in their own
potential as well as in the value of education itself.''
   High schools should replace the general curriculum with a ``core
academic curriculum'' jointly developed by representatives of the
local community, business, higher education, and ethnic
organizations. In this way, students can move from high school to
either college or the workforce.
   Other recommendations were to:
   _Establish longer school days and years to prevent summer
learning losses and pay teachers for the additional time.
   _Improve the image, pay and benefits of the teaching profession.
   _Make student achievement the main criterion against which
teachers and administrators are judged.
   _Respect and value the culture of each child in the curriculum.

   The head of Iran's tanker operations said
Tuesday that its damaged ship in the Atlantic was in danger of
spilling more oil in rough seas because Spain would not allow it
into their territorial waters, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   Mohammed Souri, managing director of the National Iranian Tanker
Co., also explained the reasons behind the Dec. 19 explosion that
caused the Khark 5 to spill what oil experts said was 19 million
gallons of oil off Morocco.
   He said a piece of the ship's superstructure tore off in 100 mph
winds and slammed onto the deck, sparking an explosion in a tank.
The explosion caused several other blasts, including a fire that
salvage crews were summoned to extinguish, Souri said.
   The crew was forced to abandon ship 400 miles north of the
Canary Islands.
   Salvage officials said the blasts punched a hole in the side of
the ship, allowing crude to leak into the sea.
   Souri however said the amount of oil spilled was not known.
   The spill threatened to seriously damage the fisheries and
beaches of the Moroccan coast, but oil experts said the area's warm
waters and rough seas broke up virtually all of the spill.
   Souri accused Morocco of exaggerating the incident.
   ``The Moroccan government ... has launched a wide-scale
propaganda tirade and called for financial aid from some countries
with the aim of hollow financial claims,'' IRNA reported him as
saying.
   Souri said the Spanish government, instead of dispatching war
ships to shadow the tanker, should allow the tanker into one of its
ports so the oil on board could be transferred to a supertanker.
   Salvage officials said 53 million gallons of light Iranian crude
oil remain on board.
   The Iranian official said rough weather was hindering the
transfer and risked a renewed spill.
   ``If the ship was allowed to discharge its crude into another
ship, the amount of pollution would be greatly less than it is
now,'' Souri said.
   Spanish maritime officials on Monday said three tugs were towing
the Khark 5 to calm seas off the Cape Verde Islands in order to
safely transfer the oil. They said the voyage could take 10 days.
   Smit Tak, the Dutch salvage company in charge of the operation,
said the ship had not leaked since last Wednesday.

   A former University of Pennsylvania
professor praised a Supreme Court ruling Tuesday that ordered the
school to disclose information she claims will show she was denied
tenure because of discrimination.
   ``I'm very delighted with the decision,'' said Rosalie Tung, now
a business professor at the University of Wisconsin. ``I fought for
the principle and I'm glad that I won it.''
   Penn and its supporters expressed concern the decision might
chill tenure review of academics by their peers.
   Ms. Tung, then an associate professor of management at Penn,
complained after she was denied tenure in 1985 at the university's
Wharton School of Business. She filed a complaint with the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging she was the victim
of illegal discrimination against women and people of Asian descent.
   Her complaint said her qualifications were equal to or better
than those of five male faculty members who received more favorable
treatment.
   Unanimously rejecting ``academic freedom'' arguments, the court
said colleges and universities enjoy no special privilege to
withhold peer review records used in awarding tenure, a lifetime
appointment. Penn claimed confidentiality in the tenure process was
necessary to ensure candor by reviewers.
   ``If there is a `smoking gun' to be found that demonstrates
discrimination in tenure decisions, it is likely to be tucked away
in peer review files,'' Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the court.
   Sarah Burns, of the National Organization for Women Legal
Defense and Education Fund, agreed ``the critical issue is `Are
there any smoking guns?'''
   ``If the university can withhold those documents, then the
university may be able to hide the very evidence that can prove
discrimination,'' said Ms. Burns.
   Ms. Tung, who declined to say if she wants to return to Penn,
said documents the EEOC sought in her case were obtained by a Penn
grievance commission that determined she was discriminated against
because of race and sex when she was denied tenure.
   Penn general counsel Shelley Green denied that claim. ``There is
absolutely no finding of discrimination in that report,'' Ms. Green
said.
   ``It is our hope that faculty members will still participate and
provide forthright evaluations of candidates for tenure,'' Ms.
Green said. ``We worry that this will discourage some participation.
   ``We are concerned people will just not be as forthcoming if
people know there is no confidentiality.''
   Sheldon Steinbach of the American Council on Education, which
along with Princeton, Brown, Stanford, Harvard and Yale had backed
Penn, said the decision could make the tenure review process less
candid.
   ``The decision may drive portions of the process underground.
For example, phone conversations may play a larger role,'' he said.
   Ms. Burns said the case involves ``very core material'' to
determine whether there was a principle reason to promote or not
promote someone.
   Ms. Burns also said not all universities guarantee
confidentiality of reviews to evaluators.
   ``We are thrilled,'' said Lorry Halloway, a Washington lawyer
who represented various organizations opposed to Penn's
non-disclosure policy.
   Had the court ruled otherwise, she said, proving discrimination
by an institution of higher learning would have been much more
difficult. ``That's why this case was so important,'' she said.
   ``We were optimistic, but this (unanimous decision) is
terrific,'' she said.

   Radical Palestinian guerrilla leader
Ahmed Jibril said Tuesday that Western accusations that he
engineered the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland were a
deliberate attempt to blackmail Syria.
   Jibril, a former Syrian army captain, heads the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. He was blamed in
the Dec. 21, 1988, explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie
that killed 270 people.
   ``We believe that this campaign is aimed at blackmailing Syria
and President Hafez Assad because the United States and (President)
Bush believe the time is ripe to settle scores with countries and
movements hostile to imperialism,'' Jibril told a hastily arranged
news conference in west Beirut.
   He said the United States and France also hold Syria responsible
for the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the U.S. Marine base and
French paratroop headquarters in Beirut that killed 241 U.S.
servicemen and 58 Frenchmen.
   ``But they do not want to face Syria outright so they did it
indirectly by trying to implicate us in the (Lockerbie) bombing,''
Jibril said.
   ``We say it loud and clear that ... Assad is not a Noriega and
Syria is not a banana republic,'' he said, referring to last
month's U.S. invasion of Panama and the arrest of former dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Asked if he condemns the Lockerbie bombing, Jibril replied, ``We
condemn all acts that lead to the killing of civilians and
innocents.
   ``But by the same token I want to ask, hasn't Bush in his recent
attack on Panama willfully killed children, women and infants?'' An
estimated 600 Panamanian soldiers and civilians died in the U.S.
invasion, as did 23 Americans, most of them soldiers.
   He dismissed as ``just fabrications'' reports that his group and
Iran plotted the Lockerbie attack together.
   Jibril and other Syrian-backed radical guerrilla groups broke
ranks with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization over
PLO recognition of Israel's right to exist.
   Jibril rejected a call by another breakaway leader, Kahled
Fahoum, for a reunification of all dissident factions with the PLO.
   ``We will talk to Arafat only when he retracts the concessions
he has made to Israel and the United States,'' he said.
   Another Syrian-backed dissident, Col. Saeed Mousa, also rejected
Fahoum's call on Tuesday.

   A mob on Tuesday stripped bare the
three-story green and gray Defense Force headquarters, a hated
symbol of the power Manuel Antonio Noriega once wielded.
   Hundreds descended on the complex embracing Noriega's former
office, surrounding military barracks and intelligence building,
damaged by heavy fire from U.S. tanks the night of the invasion.
   U.S. soldiers watched from a short distance away as Panamanians
tore apart walls with sledge hammers and hauled away window frames,
sheets of plywood, footlockers and tin sheets. U.S. engineers plan
to raze the buildings later.
   Some Panamanians built fires in the concrete patio next to cars
destroyed during the bombing and the fire that followed the Dec. 20
invasion.
   On one wall, in big letters there was a Noriega declaration that
read: ``Every man must at one time in his life decide whether he
dares go for victory, risking everything, or sit down and watch the
victors walk by.''
   On another wall, someone had written: ``Pineapple face;
coward.'' It referred to a nickname describing Noriega's
pock-marked face.
   Noriega fled the night of the invasion, went into hiding and
four days later, on Christmas Eve, asked for asylum in the Vatican
Embassy. On Jan. 3 he surrendered to the U.S. Army and was flown to
Miami to face federal drug trafficking charges.
   In front of the old building, young men approached visitors
offering old Defense Forces shoulder patches, pictures of Noriega
with other officers, letters and other Noriega memorabilia.
   One opened a large folder and offered a collection of European
pornographic magazines along with pictures of Noriega.
   ``Make me an offer for this,'' he said, offering the entire
package.
   ``Let them (the military) pay, too,'' said Pedro Ayala, who said
he had come from a nearby town.
   ``My brother and I lived in El Chorrillo. He lost everything,''
said Ricardo Aparicio, 26, dressed in fatigue pants.
   Most of El Chorrillo, a block away from Defense Forces
headquarters, burned down during the attack.
   ``The boots (military) used to run everything. They ruled. Not
now, it's over,'' Aparicio said, leaning on a sack of various items
he and a friend had taken.
   ``We all lost something. Let them lose something, too.''.
   A perspiring friend who identified himself only as Fidel dropped
rolls of copper wire and telephone wire near Aparicio's sack.
   ``There is nothing left,'' he said. ``People just swept
everything.''

<HEAD>Colombian Newspaper Defends Planned U.S. Operation to Interdict
Drugs</HEAD>

   Support solidified Tuesday for a U.S.
task force to stop drug smugglers in the Caribbean when the
country's largest circulation newspaper said critics are rejecting
Colombia's strongest ally in the drug war.
   The daily El Tiempo said in an editorial that lack of
information from the American and Colombian governments had led to
misinformation and hysteria.
   ``In a war, allies cannot be rejected; they must be sought,'' it
said.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes has criticized U.S. plans
for the task force, led by the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, to
increase air and sea patrols in international waters off Colombia.
   He said Monday, ``Any type of interference on the high seas
would need the authorization of the Colombian government,
especially of the minister of defense. Obviously, it wouldn't be
acceptable in national territory.''
   Secretary-General German Montoya and other government officials
called Londono's position ``very hard-line,'' leading to widespread
speculation that a rift has developed between the foreign minister
and President Virgilio Barco.
   Londono late Monday denied a radio report he planned to resign
after failing to persuade Barco to condemn the U.S. plan, according
to El Tiempo.
   Colombia's ambassador to the United States, Victor Mosquera
Chaux, said in an interview late Monday broadcast by Radio Caracol
that the Bush administration did not plan to search Colombian ships
without permission from the Bogota government.
   Barco has made no comment about the planned operations.
   El Tiempo said fears of U.S. intervention in Colombia were
heightened by the U.S. invasion of Panama last month.
   El Tiempo's editors wrote, ``A feeling near dread has emerged so
that at least part of public opinion already hears the stomping of
Marines' boots in the streets. For this reason, we demand more
explicit information from the Colombian and U.S. governments.''
   It said the news media were responsible for much of the
misinformation about the U.S. action, originally reported as an
attempt to enter Colombian waters and blockade its coast.
   U.S. officials said repeatedly any operations will take place in
international waters.
   El Tiempo also blamed ``diehard leftists'' and ``juvenile
minds'' for contributing to the row. The daily, which often takes
pro-U.S. stands on issues, repeated its criticism of the U.S.
invasion of Panama, but said the Caribbean operations do not pose a
similar threat to Colombia.
   It noted that the Vienna Convention, signed by Colombia and the
United States, allows ships of either country to stop and search
vessels suspected of carrying narcotics in international waters.
   ``What the United States is offering is to set up a net of
vigilance in international waters,'' El Tiempo said. ``It is
incredible that such logical and realistic measures could create a
psychosis of illegal intervention and invasion.''
   But Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist for Bogota's El Espectador,
called the proposed U.S. operation ``a unilateral act that directly
assaults (Colombian) national interests.''
   She said Washington was following a failed policy of trying ``to
militarize'' Colombia and other South American drug-producing
countries.
   She addressed herself to President Bush.
   Referring to his administration's invasion of Panama to capture
its leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, she wrote, ``You used 30,000
troops to invade a country in search of one drug trafficker, who
almost got away.''
   She said Colombia shot and killed a major drug trafficker,
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, in an operation ``carried out by only 15
men.''
   The Medellin cartel leader died in a Dec. 15 gunfight with
police in northern Colombia.
   In the Uraba region of northern Colombia, seven people were
killed and three wounded when attackers fired on a house, the
Antioquia state government said Tuesday.
   A communique, citing initial police reports, indicated the
killings occurred Sunday in Necocli, 300 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads are active in
Uraba, bordering Panama. Death squads have been blamed for previous
killings of peasants who work on banana plantations and of union
leaders who organize them.

   Radical parliamentarians Tuesday bowed to
a warning from Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to
back the government, Tehran Radio said, while the opposition
reported the arrest of a senior cleric critical of the regime.
   The lawmakers' move appeared to dampen a barrage of criticism of
President Hashemi Rafsanjani's policies the last few weeks that
brought into the open a power struggle between himself and former
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Parliament speaker
Mahdi Karrubi, a key radical, as saying: ``Today, when an excellent
force is in charge of the executive, all of us have a revolutionary
and religious duty to help him solve the difficulties to the best
of his ability.''
   Karrubi, addressing the 270-member Majlis, or parliament,
stressed: ``We are always ready to cooperate with the government,
and I assure you that any criticism ... will be entirely ... to the
benefit of the Islamic order.''
   The Majlis has been debating Rafsajani's five-year development
plan, which calls for foreign investment to revitalize the economy,
and has yet to approve it.
   Khamenei, who is allied to Rafsanjani, Monday issued a sternly
worded statement warning after weeks of parliamentary sniping at
Rafsanjani's six-month-old government that he will not tolerate any
effort by ``any individual, faction or group'' to undermine the
Islamic Republic.
   Parliament is dominated by radicals who oppose the policies
advocated by Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's more pragmatic faction.
   These center on restoring relations with the West and securing
foreign investment to revitalize the war-ravaged economy.
   Hard-liners believe foreign involvement will undermine the
Islamic revolution.
   Khamenei, who advocates free enterprise, stressed that ``any act
or word which shakes the spirit of confidence of the people toward
the government and authorities, and creates even the slightest
doubt in their support, is ... a national treachery.''
   Khamenei succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as
Iran's spritual leader following the revolutionary patriarch's
death June 3. Constitutionally, he has the last word on questions
of state and religion.
   His warning Monday was the second he has issued in two weeks,
pointing to official concern at the increasing attacks on
Rafsanjani's government by the radicals.
   Khamenei intervened last month after Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, a top Rafsanjani aide, was summoned to the Majlis to
explain why his ministry had arranged a visit by Romanian President
Nicolae Ceausescu to Tehran in December while his countrymen were
in revolt and being massacred by his secret police.
   Khamenei urged parliament to drop the issue and ``support the
government at this sensitive juncture.'' But parliament defied him
and ordered Velayati to appear for further questioning.
   In Monday's warning, Khamenei said that as supreme leader he
must be obeyed and that anyone who failed to do so were
``traitors'' to the revolution and religion.
   He said he would punish those who questioned his leadership.
   Karrubi reassured Khamenei Tuesday that if ``the spiritual
leader considers an issue prudent, the Majlis will surely abide by
it, and is duty-bound to accept it,'' the radio reported.
   But the Iraq-based Mujahedeen-Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors,
reported Tuesday that Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, until last
year Khomeini's designated successor, was briefly arrested last
week for criticizing the president.
   In a statement telexed to The Associated Press from its Baghdad
headquarters, the main Iranian oppostion group said Montazeri was
seized Jan. 6 from his house in the holy city of Qom, but released
hours later amid mounting tension in the city.
   The Mujahedeen report could not be independently confirmed. But
violence flared in Qom and Montazeri's home province of Isfahan
last April after Khomeini ditched him as heir apparent for
criticizing his policies.
   The Mujahedeen report claimed that Montazeri's criticism of
Rafsanjani and Khamenei had been welcomed by other senior clerics
at odds with the leadership.
   Last week, Montazeri branded Rafsanjani and his allies
``traitors'' following reports that Israel bought 2 million barrels
of oil worth $36 million from Iran in November in an apparent
effort to secure the release of Israelis held by Iranian-backed
militants in Lebanon.
   Iran denied that, but the U.S. State Department confirmed the
deal had taken place.

<HEAD>Ask Soviets For Help In Investigation, Senators Say</HEAD>

   The Bush administration should ask the Soviet
Union whether bodies or wreckage from Korean Air Lines Flight 007
washed ashore in areas off-limits to U.S. searchers after the
jetliner was shot down, three senators say.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Sens.
Nunn, D-Ga., Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. urge
that a formal request for assistance be submitted to the Soviets.
   ``The Soviet government's response to such an inquiry would be
helpful in our efforts to gain as much information as possible
about the fate of KAL 007,'' the letter said.
   A Soviet fighter plane shot down the unarmed passenger jetliner
after it strayed off course and entered Soviet airspace on Sept. 1,
1983. All 269 people aboard, including 63 Americans, were killed.
   The CIA and the Defense Department reported that a two-month
search failed to locate any wreckage or bodies, the letter said.
The Pentagon believes most of the wreckage was within 12 miles of
the coast of Moneron Island, an area the Soviets sealed off after
the crash, the letter said.
   ``Since U.S. vessels were not permitted to freely search the
area whee KAL 007 was thought to have crashed, we request that the
State Department initiate a formal inquiry with Soviet government
officials to determine whether any wreckage or bodies were located
by Soviet search teams or by anyone who might have been permitted
by Soviet authorities into the restricted area around Moneron
Island,'' it said.
   State Department spokesman Dave Denny said the letter was being
reviewed.
   The letter, dated Jan. 4 and made public by Levin's office
Tuesday, asks that the inquiry be made by Wednesday.
   Levin first proposed asking the Soviets for help, spokesman
Willie Blacklow said. He said Michigan residents who had relatives
on the jetliner were pressing to learn more about the tragedy.
   ``They're very anxious,'' Blacklow said. ``President Reagan
promised them an investigation and they haven't gotten it.''
   With the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, the Soviets might
be more forthcoming, Blacklow said. ``Clearly the times have
changed ... so perhaps we could get something accomplished now.''

<HEAD>Scientists Work On Seismic Equipment at Alaskan Volcano</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions following Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.

<HEAD>Committee Calls for Alaska-Siberia Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union should
establish an international park astride the Bering Strait, a study
committee told the two governments Tuesday.
   Certain details of such a park still need more study, according
to an announcement by the Interior Department of the joint report
to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and V.G. Sokolovsky, First
Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Protection of the
Environment.
   The committee of officials from both countries did not propose
boundaries for what land should be protected as parks, and said
each nation should designate appropriate sites and manage them
under its own laws and regulations.
   The National Park Service, the Interior Department agency whose
representatives formed the U.S. component of the committee, has
said the 2.8-million acre Bering Land Bridge National Preserve
should be the U.S. park under the arrangement. The Soviets are
considering several areas.
   The proposal is ``a shared chance to preserve Eskimo and other
native lifestyles as well as evidence of the rare geological,
archeological and biological heritage of this region.''
   Other recommendations of the committee call for enhanced
authority for the parks to cooperate with each other and for joint
research and public information facilities.
   The department said it hoped a Beringian Heritage International
Park can be approved by both governments in time for the 75th
anniversary of the National Park Service in 1991.
   The Bering Strait, about 50 miles wide, separates Alaska and the
Siberia region of the Soviet Union and connects the Pacific and
Arctic oceans. It is believed the avenue by which North and South
America were populated by overland migrations from Asia in
prehistoric time when sea levels were lower. It is named for Vitus
Bering, a Danish explorer in the service of Russia, whose voyage
through the strait in 1728 proved to the modern world that Asia and
North America are not connected by land.

   The top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
Yossi Ben-Aharon, said Tuesday the United States must give Israel
an absolute promise the PLO will be excluded if proposed peace
negotiations are to proceed.
   He spoke in reaction to Washington's postponement Monday of a
meeting with Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers.
   Ben-Aharon, director general of Shamir's office, told a news
conference:
   ``We want a categoric American statement that the PLO will not
be involved in the process.
   ``We feel somewhat uneasy that there is reticence on the part of
the U.S. government to say clearly that the PLO will not be
involved.''
   Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization is
a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday, Farouk Kadoumi, the PLO's foreign
minister, said the United States was not a fit peace broker because
it was ``totally biased toward Israel.''
   Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said in Cairo
Tuesday after a 90-minute meeting with Arafat that adequate
preparations should precede the proposed Mideast peace negotiations.
   He told reporters, ``Egypt is eager for establishment of the
dialogue, and to guarantee its success, adequate preparations
should be made. We cannot go to a meeting that would result in
failure.''
   U.S. officials acknowledged Monday that because of unresolved
differences Secretary of State James A. Baker III has not invited
the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers. The tripartite meeting
had been expected to convene this month to set the stage for a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Cairo on Israel's proposal for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``It is absurd to have a meeting if the meeting produces
nothing,'' State Department Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Monday.
   Shamir told reporters Tuesday during a tour of northern Israel
he was not surprised.
   ``He (Baker) is interested that this meeting bring about
positive results,'' Shamir said.
   ``We have to arrive at an agreement, and as long as there is no
agreement, I suppose that the convening of this meeting will be
postponed.''
   Last Friday, Israeli newspapers published a draft letter from
Baker suggesting that Baker was unwilling to meet Israel's demand
for rigid guarantees on the PLO's role and other issues.
   Ben-Aharon told reporters, ``We are trying to make it absolutely
clear to our friends in the United States that we are not seeking
any kind of a cover, fig leaf, for indirect exchanges, contacts
with the PLO. We don't want the PLO involved in this process.''
   He rejected a U.S. call that Israel rescind its travel ban on
nine pro-PLO activists from the occupied territories, including
those most active in behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts.
   Ben-Aharon said the restriction was because of violation of
security regulations and had ``no connection'' with the
Palestinians' involvement in the peace process.
   The State Department said Monday the ban ``sends the wrong
signal to Palestinians who favor dialogue as an alternative to
continued confrontation.''
   Israel TV said Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens are not
ruling out participation of deportees allowed to return to the
occupied lands.
   It said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is considering letting
``some'' deportees return where they could be viewed by Shamir and
Arens as residents of the West Bank and Gaza.
   The move would be a compromise with the PLO demand that
Palestinians from both inside and outside the territories should
take part in the talks.
   Arab reports said Arab assailants on Tuesday killed a
Palestinian woman they said collaborated with Israel, and soldiers
wounded 25 Palestinians during a general strike in the occupied
territories.
   Merchants closed shop, public transportation halted and workers
stayed home to mark the beginning of the 26th month of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 646 Palestinians
during the rebellion; 43 Israelis have died in the violence, and
167 Palestinians _ suspected of collaboration or involvement in
drugs or prostitution _ have been killed by fellow Arabs.

   Panama's new U.N. ambassador on Tuesday
presented his credentials to the United Nations secretary-general
in a ceremony aimed at putting to rest conflicting claims to the
post.
   Both Eduardo Vallarino, the choice of the U.S.-installed
government in Panama and President Guillermo Endara, and Mirla
Bellavita, his rival from the ousted regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, have contested the seat.
   U.N. legal officials noted, however, that the acceptance of
credentials by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was a
formality and did not exclude the possibility of a challenge to
Vallarino's credentials in the General Assembly.
   The next likely time for a challenge, U.N. officials said, would
be the special General Assembly session on drug trafficking, set
for mid-February. At that time, they said, the Credentials
Committee of the General Assembly may be asked to consider Panama's
credentials, in light of the overthrown government.
   Vallarino, 52, a longtime member of the opposition in Panama,
had been in exile in the United States since 1987. In Panama he had
been president of the Panama Association for Business Executives.
   While in the United States, he was an associate member of the
Kennedy Center for International Studies in Boston and also served
on the Panama Commission for Human Rights.

<DATELINE>YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Nixon's 77th birthday was
a bi-coastal observance Tuesday, with city workers in his hometown
getting a paid holiday while the former president planned a quiet
family dinner.
   The Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace Foundation used
the occasion to invite reporters on a brown-bag lunch tour of the
nearly completed $20 million library. It will be dedicated in July.
   On the East Coast, Nixon worked on a book due in April.
   ``President Nixon spent the morning putting the finishing
touches on the galley proofs for his new book, `In the Arena,'
paying special attention to new sections about (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev, China and Eastern Europe,'' Nixon spokesman
John Taylor said from Nixon's office at Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
   Taylor said Nixon and his wife, Pat, planned to have dinner in
New York City with members of the family. He said he was unaware of
any unusual gifts.
   Profits from the book, whose full title is ``In the Arena: A
Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal,'' which Nixon calls the most
personal he has ever written, will go to the library foundation.
Simon &amp; Schuster declined to disclose how much Nixon was getting
for the book, his seventh.
   Hugh Hewitt, director of the library foundation, presided over
the tour of the library, a Spanish-style building he described as a
``window'' into the career of the nation's 37th president.
   There will be ``full and fair treatment'' of Watergate, Hewitt
said.
   The Nixon library 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles will be the
first of two presidential libraries to open in Southern California.
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opens next year in Simi
Valley, 75 miles away.
   Unlike other presidential libraries, the 45,000-square-foot
Nixon library won't be supported by tax dollars. The former chief
executive insisted on it.
   For about 100 city workers in the community of 40,000, Tuesday
was a paid day off. The Yorba Linda City Council voted in September
to make Jan. 9 a holiday in honor of its most famous citizen.
   ``Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon's resignation
and history has shown the importance of his presidency,
particularly with respect to his brilliance in foreign policy,''
the holiday resolution said.

   Peru said Tuesday it granted diplomatic asylum
to a top Noriega associate who is on the U.S. most-wanted list and
to 11 others who took refuge in the Peruvian ambassador's residence
in Panama City.
   U.S. troops have ringed the residence since Monday afternoon.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jose Torres told The Associated Press
that Gonzalo Gonzalez, identified by Panamanian authorities as a
former captain and chief of security for deposed dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega, has taken refuge in the residence and been granted
diplomatic asylum by the Peruvian government.
   Torres said the 12 would be allowed to come to Peru if they
wished, but no discussions had taken place thus far about where
they would go.
   ``It is supposed that they will try to go to some friendly
country, perhaps Peru,'' Torres said.
   ``If they want to come here, we will accept them.''
   Torres denied that another Noriega associate, former Lt. Col.
Luis Cordova, considered with Gonzalez to be the most-wanted men on
the list of former Noriega officials, was also at the residence.
   Panama has said Cordova, who is alleged to have tortured
prisoners of the government ousted by Noriega, also is in the
ambassador's residence.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox said Cordova had sought
refuge in the residence, but Peruvian officials refused. Larco Cox
said Cordova was considered unwelcome and left the residence ``of
his own will.''
   Larco Cox did not say if Cordova was apprehended by American
troops or if he left before they surrounded the residence.
   Peru listed the others granted asylum as Capt. Marcela Tason,
Noriega's secretary, and her husband Ulises Rodriguez; Capt.
Narcisa Castillero and her daughter Patricia Ceutte; Maj.
Heraclides Sucre, his wife Daisy Batista, three children, and his
mother Judith Medina; and Maj. Edgardo Lopez.
   The government issued a communique Tuesday saying Peru has
notified Panamanian authorities of its decision granting them
diplomatic asylum.
   Peru also released a statement Tuesday saying it registered a
protest with the U.S. ambassador in Peru, Anthony Quainton,
concerning the presence of U.S. troops around the ambassador's
residence. It complained the action creates ``an unnecessary
climate of tension and impedes the normal development of activities
of our mission in Panama.''
   The communique condemned the U.S. intervention and called for
withdrawal of troops.
   Peru recalled its ambassador to Panama, Mario Castro, in May
after Noriega annulled elections won by Guillermo Endara. Castro
resigned his post Dec. 26 in a break with the Garcia government
over its response to the U.S. intervention.
   The government has not named a replacement for Castro, who
returned to Panama Monday to collect his belongings from the
residency.
   President Alan Garcia has roundly criticized the U.S. invasion,
and refused to recognize the Endara government.
   Garcia first said he would not attend next month's drug summit
with President Bush in protest, but said Sunday he would go if U.S.
troops are first withdrawn.
   The summit is scheduled for Feb. 15 in Cartagena, Colombia.
Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia are to meet with Bush to discuss strategies to fight the
drug trade in the United States and South America.
   Garcia ordered the Panamanian flag raised at the government
palace the day after the invasion, and officials said it will
continue to fly there as long as U.S. troops remain in Panama.
   The same day Garcia ordered joint operations with U.S.
anti-narcotics agents suspended. The operations resumed six days
later.

<HEAD>Romania Asks U.S. For Trade Privileges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>

   The new government said Tuesday it
would seek Most Favored Nation trading status with the United
States as well as restoration of other privileges and ties.
   Ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had renounced the U.S. trade
agreement in February 1988, when it appeared the U.S. Congress
would not renew it because of human rights abuses by Ceausescu's
regime.
   The Foreign Ministry said it was ``empowered to nullify the
abusive and unilateral Feb. 29, 1988, declaration of the former
regime which gave up the granting by the U.S.A. of the most favored
nation clause.''
   The ministry said a decision Monday to lift all travel
restrictions on Romanians paved the way for Romania and the United
States to resume the trade privileges, which exempted from some
customs duties Romanian products arriving in the United States.
   Washington granted the privileges to Romania in 1975 when
Ceausescu was courted by the United States as a Communist maverick.
They were tied to human rights, including free travel and
emigration under the 35-nation Helsinki Final Act.
   Washington increasingly grew critical of Ceausescu's suppression
of free speech, religious practice and political organization. In
breaking the accord, the dictator said the U.S. pressure on him to
honor human rights pledges violated the principles of foreign
relations.
   Ceausescu was toppled last month in a popular uprising. The
provisional government convicted he and his wife, Elena, of ``grave
crimes'' and executed them Dec. 25.
   Romania estimated the lost trade privileges cost it $250 million
in export revenues from the United States, which totaled $775
million in 1987. The Romanians sell wooden furniture, small
engines, leather, textiles, gasoline and aluminium products to the
United States.
   The governing National Salvation Front also asked for diplomatic
ties with the European Community and membership in international
satellite organizations.
   In Brussels, Belgium, a European Community Commission spokesman
said the EC's external relations commissioner, Frans Andriessen,
will discuss the request with Romanian authorities in Bucharest on
Sunday.
   Romania and Albania are the only East European nations with
which the EC has no diplomatic ties.
   The state news agency Rompress said the international satellite
organization Intelsat would allow Romania to join, and that the
country was trying to join other such organizations.
   Ceausescu had rejected Romania's membership in the organizations
``because he was not interested in linking Romania to Europe and
the whole world,'' Rompres said.
   The news agency also reported that leaders of a 1987 protest of
the Ceausescu dictatorship were allowed to return from internal
exile.
   The leaders were deported to other parts of the country
following the Nov. 15, 1987, protest in Brasov, which involved at
least 10,000 people. Rompres said 74 people returned to the truck
manufacturing enterprise in Brasov, but it was not clear how many
had been banished.
   Rompres on Tuesday also gave details from the trial of a member
of Ceausescu's security forces who was sentenced to nine years in
prison in the first announced conviction resulting from military
tribunals set up by the interim government.
   The defendant, identified as Ioan Bundea, a police major in
Sibiu, was sentenced in the Transylvanian city after being found
guilty of attempted murder, the report said.
   Rompress said Bundea had opened fire on a group of five army
officers Dec. 22 battling Ceausescu security forces, injuring one
of them.
   The report, which did not provide further details, said other
such trials were scheduled in Sibiu this week.
   Captured members of security units who battled the army face a
maximum life sentence.

   Shining Path rebels shot and killed a former
defense minister Tuesday morning in a shopping center parking lot,
making him the highest-ranking official to be slain in 10 years of
guerrilla war in Peru, officials said.
   Enrique Lopez, shot at close range as he was parking his car in
the Lima suburb of San Isidro, was the first cabinet-level official
killed in the escalating guerrilla violence that has claimed the
lives of hundreds of federal and local officials.
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who asked not to be
identified, said four men with submachine guns pumped at least 10
bullets into Lopez at 10 a.m. two miles south of downtown Lima. He
said Lopez was alone in the vehicle.
   Lopez, rushed to a nearby military hospital, died in surgery,
officials said.
   Reporters at the scene said Lopez's car was riddled with bullets.
   Witnesses told officials the four gunmen fled in an automobile.
Police blocked streets and highways throughout this capital city
and rounded up dozens of people for questioning.
   Witnesses interviewed by The Associated Press said Lopez had an
office in the shopping complex, and usually arrived the same time
every day, often accompanied by a bodyguard.
   Lopez was Peru's named the country's first defense minister by
President Alan Garcia, taking office in 1987 when the ministry was
formed. He had served as minister of the army until the armed
forces were joined under one ministry that year.
   He was replaced last May by army Gen. Julio Velasquez.
   Officials blamed the attack on the fanatical Shining Path, a
radical Maoist terrorist group that has been fighting to topple
Peru's elected governments since 1980.
   While no group claimed responsibility for the killing, police
said the attack bore similarities to those of the shadowy terrorist
group, the Shining Path.
   Shining Path began its attacks in the Andean highlands last
decade but in the last year has increasingly conducted assaults in
the capital, Peru's largest city.
   Speaking to reporters at the government palace, Garcia said,
``We have lost an extraordinary man.''
   Garcia said Lopez had the right to a military guard, and said he
didn't understand why Lopez was alone when he was attacked.
   ``It pains me and I regret that he was alone in spite of the
situation of war we are living in,'' Garcia said.
   The Senate observed a minute of silence Tuesday afternoon
honoring Lopez. And the Democratic Front, a coalition of
center-right parties supporting front-running presidential
candidate Mario Vargas Llosa, issued a statement condemning the
assassination.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the 10
years of violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

<TEXT>
   Blackjack players shouldn't gamble on
a study indicating that casinos don't shuffle playing cards enough
for a good mix, casino officials and card players said Tuesday.
   They scoffed at a computer study that shows shuffling a deck
seven times decreases bettors' changes of predicting the next card.
   More shuffling means less betting time, and casino officials
said that would have a greater effect on their bottom line.
   ``We have to weigh everything out,'' said Howard Dreitzer,
senior vice president of casino operations at Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino. ``If it takes an extra five minutes to shuffle, what we
would lose at the tables?''
   In November, Atlantic City's casinos took in about $44.3 million
from the blackjack tables, about 20.5 percent of the casinos'
$215.7 million winnings, acccording to the Casino Control
Commission figures.
   Most casinos in Atlantic City combine eight decks of cards and
shuffle the whole pack twice by hand to get their mix. In
blackjack, players try to get cards totaling as close to 21 as
possible without going over.
   But the two researchers who conducted the computer study said a
deck needs to be shuffled seven times to prevent astute
cardwatchers from figuring what the next card might be.
   Dave Bayer, a mathemetician and computer scientist at Columbia
University in New York, described the seventh shuffle as a mere
follow-up to card players' nagging doubts that the deck is never
properly shuffled.
   Bayer did the study with Persi Diaconis, a statistician and
mathematician at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.
   Fewer shuffles than seven increase the probability that the
cards are not mixed properly, Bayer said in a telephone interview
from New York. But shuffling more than seven times does
increasingly little to improve randomness.
   ``It's a recreational math problem, but it applies to a whole
lot of people,'' Bayer said. ``People had an intuition that
something was not right.''
   Dreitzer said his casino is satisfied with two shuffles of eight
decks.
   ``Random is a concept,'' he said, laughing at the idea that ``we
could shuffle a deck of cards all day if we wanted to.''
   Dave Brogan, a self-professed card counter and the placement
coordinator for the Professional Dealers School in Atlantic City,
said that even if players were able to master where cards might be,
they would have to have a dealer who shuffled the cards exactly the
same every time.
   ``I've got dealers that can shuffle the deck twice better than
others who shuffle it five and six times,'' he said.
   Bayer credits Diaconis, also a magician who likes card tricks,
with watching amateur and professional dealers' shuffling patterns
for years to assemble the data that led to the computer study.
   Bayer said six decks of cards needs to be shuffled 12 times, but
that most casinos don't want to waste time shuffling the cards.
   Alyce Parker, a spokeswoman for Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino,
said the two shuffles required of dealers at her gaming hall are
enough to ensure a good mix. ``Two makes sure the security
precautions are there,'' she said.
   Wayne G. Marlin, a spokesman for the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said regulators leave it up to the casinos to
determine how many times a deck needs to be shuffled to determine
randomness.
   An automatic shuffling machine is under consideration by the
Casino Control Commission, but has yet to be approved, said
commission spokesman Tom Flynn.
   Bayer advises amateurs not to bank on his formula.
   ``There are people who can take advantage of non-randomness,''
Bayer said. ``But it takes incredible patience and there are better
ways to make money.''

   A cult leader refused Tuesday to return
voluntarily to Ohio and answer charges in the ritualistic slayings
of a family of five.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 39; his wife, Alice, 38; and their eldest son,
Damon, 19; all pleaded innocent through their attorneys to Ohio
fugitive complaints, triggering formal extradition proceedings that
could take at least 90 days.
   ``Sometimes I wish it wasn't so drawn out but it does work
eventually,'' said John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy
district attorney.
   The Lundgrens were chained together at the waists as they made
their first court appearance since their arrests in nearby National
City on Sunday. Alice Lundgren and her son held hands. None of them
spoke during the hearing.
   Milly Durovic, the attorney representing Jeffrey Lundgren,
declined to discuss her client's refusal to return to Ohio
voluntarily.
   Municipal Court Judge Timothy Tower ordered the three held
without bond.
   Prosecutors in Ohio will have to petition California Gov. George
Deukmejian for the defendants' forced return to stand trial for the
slayings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three young daughters.
   A self-proclaimed ``prophet,'' Lundgren was a lay minister in
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Ohio
before he was ousted for radical teachings.
   He persuaded other members to follow him and the splinter group
went to live on a farm in Kirtland, 30 miles east of Cleveland.
Five bodies were unearthed on the farm last week.
   Investigators believe the Averys were killed in April just
before Lundgren and his followers moved to a farm near Holden, Mo.
Cult members had scattered by New Year's Eve when an informant told
authorities about the slaying.
   The Lundgrens were arrested outside a motel in National City,
which is about five miles south of San Diego, by federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and police.
   Three other Lundgren children _ Kristen, 10, Caleb, 9, and
Jason, 15 _ also were taken into protective custody and have been
released to the custody of other family members, ATF agent Scott
Parkhurst said after Tuesday's hearing.
   Federal agents continued looking in Southern California for the
last two of the 13 people indicted in the slayings of the Averys.
   The 13, who federal and local authorities say belonged to a
religious cult, were charged with aggravated murder, kidnapping or
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   Lake County, Ohio, prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette, has said the
Averys apparently were killed as a sacrifice that would cleanse
cult members' souls and allow them to travel to the wilderness.
   But Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the
Reorganized Church, said the Averys may have been killed because of
disputes over money, sex or fear the Averys would leave the cult.
   The Reorganized Church, based in Independence, Mo., has roots
and some beliefs in common with the Salt Lake City-based Mormon
Church but is separate.
   The Mormon Church is based on revelations that Joseph Smith said
were brought to him in the 1820s by a heavenly messenger. After
Smith's death in 1844, the church split into factions, the largest
of which is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   The Reorganized Church was founded by Smith's son Joseph III and
claims to be a continuation of the original church.
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a
statement from its Salt Lake City headquarters on Tuesday
disassociating itself from Lundgren.
   ``Jeffrey Lundgren and his wife and son ... have never been
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,'' said
Bruce L. Olsen, managing director of public communications for the
Mormon Church. ``We deplore the tragedy and extend our sympathy to
survivors of the victims.''

   Two gunmen shot to death a
part-time soldier of the Ulster Defense Regiment militia Tuesday
inside his shoe shop in Castlederg, 70 miles west of Belfast,
police said.
   A small bomb exploded in the shop as police arrived and one
officer was hospitalized suffering from shock, police said.
   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the victim,
Olven Kilpatrick, 32, had been a part-time member of the Regiment
since 1975.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility but police said they
believe the Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland did the shooting.
   The slaying of Kilpatrick was the third death this year in
Northern Ireland's sectarian strife that has claimed at least 2,776
lives since the violence began in 1969.
   In an unrelated development Tuesday, Danny Morrison, vice
president of Sinn Fein, legal political arm of the outlawed IRA,
was charged with conspiracy to murder, false imprisonment and IRA
membership, police said.
   Morrison was one of nine people arrested after police and troops
raided a house in Andersonstown, an IRA stronghold area in west
Belfast, late Sunday.
   The domestic British news agency Press Association quoted
unnamed security sources as saying that a man who had been abducted
two days before was found in the house during the raid and was
taken into protective police custody.
   After being charged by police Tuesday, Morrison remained in
police custody awaiting a court appearance. Police gave no other
details.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland with the 95 percent Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule.

   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.

   Wildlife rescuers wrapped a sling
around the tail of a 40-foot-long whale beached in mud and towed it
back into the Gulf of Mexico at high tide Tuesday.
   ``We got real lucky, a surge of water came in just when we
needed it,'' said Pete Juneau, a state marine biologist. ``If we
hadn't moved it then, we wouldn't have moved it. We figured we'd
have to euthanize it.''
   The animal, identified by biologists as a Bryde's whale, was
freed about 24 hours after it was spotted by oil company employees
in a helicopter. It was stranded in a remote area near an
industrial area used by shrimpers and offshore oil workers.
   The animal lay in as little as 6 inches of water at low tide,
flipping its tail and rocking itself in an apparent effort to get
to deeper water, witnesses said.
   After high tide brought in 4 feet of water, rescuers wrapped a
canvas sling around the whale's tail and slowly towed it into
deeper waters. It began swimming alongside the boat as rescuers
removed the sling.
   Workers kept the whale in sight until it was roughly 3{ miles
offshore, said Gina Barron of the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding
Network in Galveston.
   ``It looked pretty good,'' said Barron, summoned to the scene by
Louisiana wildlife officials. ``We stayed with it for quite a
while. We monitored its respiration. It was breathing about every
1{ minutes, which was good. It was swimming strongly and didn't
appear to have water in its lungs.''
   Shallow water and deep, thick mud had hampered the rescue on the
central Louisiana shore in Vermilion Parish about 20 miles
south-southwest of Intracoastal City.
   ``It's all marsh and real rough. You can't walk to it. We had
people try that and they sank up to their waists in mud,'' said
James Manning, assistant administrator of the Wildlife and
Fisheries Fur and Refuge Division.
   Wildlife officials observed the animal from aboard a skiff and
an oil crew boat on the gulf. At one time, five helicopters with
reporters and photographers hovered over the whale.
   Rescuers returned to port Tuesday evening hoping their effort
wasn't in vain.
   ``I'm not going to say it's safe,'' said Harry Blanchet, a
biologist with the Louisiana Department of Wildife and Fisheries.
``There has to be a reason it came in in the first place. You can
never tell, but I'll tell you one thing, if it doesn't make it,
you're going to see some grown men cry.''

   Students in Bialystok ended an occupation
of local Communist Party headquarters in that northeastern city
after officials promised the building will be turned over to the
university, PAP said Tuesday.
   The news agency said students of the Independent Students
Association (NZS), a nationwide pro-Solidarity organization,
removed protest banners and cleaned up the rooms after a settlement
was reached.
   Parties to the agreement were NZS; the mayor of Bialystok, a
city 120 miles from Warsaw; regional officials; and the local
Citizens' Committee, which operates as the Solidarity trade union's
political arm, the agency reported.
   The Communist Party's lease will terminate on Jan. 31 and the
building will be turned over the university in Bialystok, a branch
of Warsaw University.
   The party has decided to dissolve itself and form a new party.
   Debate about future party rights to buildings has gone on since
Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected prime minister on Aug.
24, ending more than four decades of Communist control of the
government.
   PAP also reported a Solidarity local stopped work for two hours
Tuesday at a mine in Jastrzebie, southern Poland, where labor
unrest 18 months ago set in motion the changes under way in Poland,
to demand reform of mine management.
   The local said it wants to negotiate a new pay structure and
wants a ban on hiring new administrative staff at the mine, which
employs about 8,000 people.
   PAP did not say how many miners took part.

   The nation's first recipient of a liver
transplant from a living donor is being checked daily at the
University of Chicago Medical Center after being released, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Alyssa Smith, 22 months old, was released Monday and spent the
night at the nearby Ronald McDonald House with her mother, Teresa
Smith, who donated part of her liver to her daughter in the
historic Nov. 27 operation, hospital spokesman John Easton said.
   Alyssa is to return daily to a clinic so doctors can monitor her
progress, Easton said. ``It's a way for her to have some of the
comforts of home and still be under the watchful eye of
physicians,'' Easton said.
   Doctors hoped Alyssa would be able to return home to Schertz,
Texas, early next week, Easton said.
   The Ronald McDonald House is designed to provide housing for
families of hospitalized or recovering children.
   Meanwhile, 16-month-old Sarina Jones of Millington, Tenn., who
on Dec. 8 became the second living-donor transplant recipient, was
listed in serious condition at the hospital, Easton said.
   ``It's too soon to predict when she will be released, but she's
doing well,'' he said. ``Her liver continues to function very well,
she's eating solid food and has actually put on a little bit of
weight.''
   Easton said that starting next month the University of Chicago
Medical Center plans to perform two living-donor liver transplants
a month.
   In Pittsburgh, another transplant pioneer, 12-year-old Stormie
Jones, remained in serious condition Tuesday with a mild liver
virus, but a biopsy showed no evidence of organ rejection, said
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh spokeswoman Margy Buczynski.
   ``She's up and around and looking really good,'' Buczynski said.
   Stormie, who became the world's first recipient of both a
transplanted heart and liver in 1984, was admitted to the hospital
Saturday.
   The White Settlement, Texas, girl has been treated off and on
for mild episodes of organ rejection since the transplant,
performed at Children's Hospital. Last year, she began receiving a
new Japanese drug known as FK-506 that is believed to be 50 to 100
times more powerful than the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine.

   An ex-junkie who later attended Yale University
was found innocent Tuesday of a charge he illegally doled out clean
needles and syringes to drug addicts to prevent the spread of AIDS.
   Jon Parker, 35, was acquitted after a one-day, non-jury trial in
Boston Municipal Court.
   He is founder of a 50-member group called the AIDS Brigade,
comprised of former Yale graduate students and ex-addicts and
convicts. It was formed about five years ago and distributes AIDS
education materials, bleach and needles in Boston, New York, New
Haven, Conn.; and New Jersey.
   Parker testified in his own defense, saying the distribution
program was aimed at saving the lives of drug addicts at risk for
the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome by sharing
contaminated needles.
   ``I would say that if I could save one life, then we should do
that,'' he said.
   Parker said before his trial began that he hoped to change a
requirement for a prescription to buy hypodermic syringes. Mayor
Raymond Flynn endorsed a needle exchange program that was rejected
by the City Council last year.
   Critics of needle exchange programs say it encourages drug use.
Parker was also criticized for being too much of a renegade to
properly conduct AIDS prevention.
   Last year, the nation's first full-scale, government-sponsored
needle exchange program to fight the spread of AIDS was approved by
the Tacoma-Pierce County Board of Health in Tacoma, Wash.
   Addicts meet AIDS Brigade workers in dingy restaurants and on
street corners to get their sets of needles, known as ``works.''
   Among those who testified in support of Parker's program were a
British physician in charge of a needle exchange program in
Liverpool, England, and a pediatrician from Boston City Hospital
who is the mayor's adviser on AIDS.
   The adviser, Dr. George Lamb, warned that within a year the rate
of AIDS infection in Boston will increase to about 10 out of 100
people.
   Dr. Alan Parry of Liverpool cited what he said was his program's
consistent success in AIDS prevention, saying police there carry
leaflets advertising the program.
   Parker has said he is uniquely qualified to bring AIDS
prevention to the streets because of his background.
   He shot heroin as a teen-ager and robbed drug stores for money
and supplies. At 17, he served time in jail, earning a high school
equivalency diploma behind bars. In 1974, a month after his
release, he was caught violating parole and was allowed to check
into a drug rehabilitation center.
   In the years since, Parker has held a variety of jobs. He drove
a cab and endured a few bouts as a boxer to pay his way through
Hampshire College in Amherst. He studied biology at Hampshire
College, then went to Yale's School of Epidemiology and Public
Health.

   A teen-ager expelled from a Roman Catholic high
school for marrying said Tuesday she wants an apology and to be
readmitted with all student privileges, including the right to go
to the senior prom.
   Dressed in her school uniform and carrying her books in a
backpack, Elizabeth Valeri, 17, told reporters gathered behind the
nuns' residence at Maria High School that she believes her
expulsion last week may be discriminatory.
   ``I want some kind of apology because I have not been doing
anything bad,'' she said. ``I want to be accepted back in
school.... I want prom, I want graduation, I want it all.''
   Elizabeth talked to reporters after her new husband, Xavier, 20,
drove her to the residence for tutoring sessions arranged so she
won't miss exams scheduled at the end of this week. The school's
principal, Sister Grace Ann, has said the tutoring was being
provided with the assumption that Elizabeth will soon be enrolled
in another school.
   Elizabeth's attorney, Robert Shindler, said later that he sent a
letter Tuesday to the principal threatening a lawsuit unless the
senior is readmitted and gets the apology she seeks.
   ``I want her back in the school where she has been for the last
3{ years,'' Shindler said, though he added that he's also trying to
find another Catholic school that might accept Elizabeth.
   It is up to each school under the umbrella of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Chicago to set policy on married students, said
Brother Donald P. Houde, an archdiocese spokesman.
   The controversy was touched off last week after the bride and
groom appeared in a picture in the Chicago Sun-Times as the first
couple to marry in Cook County in 1990. She said she was told that
day that she was being dismissed for breaking school rules.
   Sister Grace Ann has said Elizabeth was expelled because she
broke school rules forbidding students to marry.
   The principal said Tuesday evening that the marriage didn't set
the right example for other students.
   ``Maria High School endorses and encourages the sacrament of
marriage within the Catholic Church and by men and women who are
properly prepared and who have reached the age of majority,''
Sister Grace Ann said in a statement. ``Marriage outside the church
and prior to high school graduation, while legal, does not
constitute an appropriate example for other students here at
Maria.''
   She said Monday that it would be difficult to discipline married
students since they theoretically are not responsible to their
parents anymore but to their spouse.
   ``Who do we deal with? That's the question,'' Sister Grace Ann
said.
   Sister Grace Ann also said that unwed mothers are allowed to
return to Maria after giving birth, partly to help discourage
abortion.
   ``That's a different lifestyle than a married student,'' Sister
Grace Ann said. ``This school is a school for single women, not a
school for married women.''
   Shindler said he is seeking a ``written, formal apology'' for
``the expulsion, the notoriety, the embarrassment, the treatment''
that Elizabeth received from the school.
   For her tutoring sessions, Elizabeth has been asked to enter
through the back door of the nun's residence, Shindler said.
   ``She is being treated almost like a leper,'' he said.
   ``I didn't do this to hurt anyone and I don't feel that I should
be treated this way,'' Elizabeth said.
   She also said her lifestyle has not changed significantly,
because she still will live at her family's house, while Xavier
will live at his for a while. ``It's just a boyfriend-girlfriend
relationship,'' she said.
   ``They are rules, but are they discriminatory _ that is the
question,'' she said.
   Asked why she didn't wait until after graduation to marry,
Elizabeth said: ``Why should I wait? I am not doing anything wrong.
   ``I just don't feel guilty,'' she said. ``I love him and he
loves me.'

   About 150 backers of an AIDS protest group tried
to block entrances to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
the street in front of it Tuesday, charging that the CDC
underreports AIDS cases.
   About 50 people were arrested, said police Maj. Jim Wilson. He
said some would be charged with criminal trespass and some with
damaging government property.
   Fourteen people who climbed onto a building overhang were
arrested by DeKalb County officers, who removed the ladder they had
used to scale the building.
   The group, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP,
contends that the CDC, where much of the nation's AIDS research is
done, underreports AIDS-related illnesses and does not use a broad
enough definition of the AIDS virus.
   ``It's far too narrow. It's out of date,'' said Chip Rowan, a
protester from Atlanta. ``They are seeing it (AIDS) in the clinics,
cervical cancer and TB. It's not news to the people in the clinics.
It's news to the people in the CDC.''
   Protesters waved signs reading, ``AIDS Won't Wait, Expand the
Definition,'' and ``CDC: Inaccurate, Inadequate and Intolerable.''
   The group also claimed the CDC gives incomplete information
about ways the AIDS virus can be contracted.
   CDC spokesman Don Barretth said the protestor's claims were
incorrectly leveled at the agency. He said the CDC has met with ACT
UP members before, and hopes to do so again in a less
confrontational setting.
   A few counterprotesters carried signs reading, ``Gay is Not OK''
and ``You Don't Have to Be Gay.''
   One, Mark Weaver, executive director of the Family Association
of Texas, accused ACT UP members of strong-arm tactics. At one
point, he was mobbed by ACT UP members who taunted Weaver and his
supporters.
   ``They want to be heard,'' Weaver said after the protestors left
him, ``but they don't want anyone else to be heard.''
   In addition to blocking streets and entrances to the CDC complex
near Emory University, demonstrators pounded on doors and ran a
banner up the CDC flagpole. DeKalb County officers, many wearing
latex gloves, did not start making arrests until protesters climbed
onto the building.
   On Monday, about 300 homosexual activists converged on the
Capitol in Atlanta to protest Georgia's 156-year-old sodomy law and
to urge the repeal of similar laws in other states.
   Police said 63 people were arrested at that demonstration,
sponsored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

   A bigger, flashier Disneyland _ possibly
including an ``Indiana Jones'' stunt attraction and a 1930s-style
Hollywood movie lot _ are on the drawing boards, Disney officials
said in a report published Tuesday.
   Officials are keeping a tight lid on their plans, reportedly the
most ambitious since the park's opening in 1955, until Friday, when
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner is scheduled to make an announcement.
   ``It involves the next 10 years, but I can't tell you anymore,''
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said in the report published in the
Orange County Register. ``Obviously he (Eisner) wants to make the
announcement.''
   Last week, Disneyland President Richard Nunis showed the plans
to several park employees.
   The employees said the plans include a stunt attraction based on
the ``Indiana Jones'' movies that could go near the park's Thunder
Mountain Railroad ride and the Hollywood back lot, which apparently
would be similar to one at Florida's Disneyworld.
   Employees said other attractions would be based on the Muppet
characters, which Disney bought the rights to last year, and the
Roger Rabbit cartoon character. A new Muppet movie is also a
possibility, the employees were told.
   ``They said none of this was guaranteed,'' said Disney employee
Christy Bauer. ``But I got the impression that it was probably
going to happen because everything was really detailed.''
   Disney has about 78 acres available for expansion in Anaheim,
including about 30 acres within the park.
   Anaheim City Manager Bob Simpson said he hadn't heard of any
proposed expansion.
   ``We've been talking about expanding Disneyland for years,'' he
said, ``but everybody agrees that nothing can be done until we do
something about the traffic in the commercial-recreation area.''

<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday acquitted Parliament member
Lorne Nystrom of shoplifting, agreeing with Nystrom he was
absent-minded but not dishonest when he failed to pay for two disks
used to clean contact lenses.
   The merchandise was valued at less than $7.
   Judge Brian Lennox, who heard the case without a jury, noted
that the New Democratic deputy from Saskatchewan said he
absent-mindedly dropped the cleaner into his pocket and ``I am
satisfied, on the basis of his evidence alone, that it is true.''
   Mindy Gosman, a security guard at Shopper Drug Mart, said she
saw Nystrom take the disks from a package last Nov. 29 and that he
later paid for two toothbrushes but not for the cleaner.
   Nystrom, 43, expressed relief the highly publicized case was
behind him.
   ``It's something I wouldn't wish on anybody,'' he said. ``It's
more horrible than I can even describe, because it was so public,
in terms of my friends and my family and my party.''
   His lawyer, Clayton Ruby, has a reputation as one of the highest
priced criminal lawyers in Canada. Ruby refused to estimate his
bill but said, ``It's not going to be crippling.''
   Nor would Ruby estimate the cost of lining up an array of expert
witnesses, some of whom were flown in.
   The theft charge against Nystrom carried a maximum penalty of
six months in jail and a fine of $1,700.

   Many consumers and businesses may see cheaper borrowing costs by
next month following a long-awaited drop in banks' prime lending
rate, which fell to the lowest level in 14 months.
   The cut, to 10 percent from 10.5 percent effective Monday, marks
the first reduction in nearly half a year and reflects the overall
declining cost of money that banks have enjoyed recently due to
more liberal credit policies by the Federal Reserve.
   The central bank moved to ease interest rates late last year to
help forestall a feared economic downturn. Lower rates spur growth
by encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow money.
   Banks use the prime as a benchmark for interest rates on a wide
range of borrowing by consumers and small- and medium-size
companies.

   A congressional committee's eight-day trip to
Hawaii comes in the dead of winter, but the congresswoman who
arranged the excursion denies it's another political junket to a
warm, tropical locale.
   ``We do have problems in paradise,'' Rep. Patricia Saiki,
D-Hawaii, said after the first hearing in Hawaii on Monday by the
House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.
   The memorandum from the chairman of the committee says the
purpose of the trip is to examine national ocean and coastal policy.
   One day's itinerary, however, details a different type of
January excursion: ``9:30 a.m. Depart hotel for Sand Point
Container Yard to tour Matson Navigation Facilities _ approximately
two hours; 11:30 a.m. Return to hotel. Afternoon free; 5:30 p.m.

   Art Buchwald's victory over Paramount
Pictures about rights to ``Coming to America'' was hailed as a
triumph for writers, but the studio feared the court decision could
mean a rash of bogus lawsuits.
   ``I am very, very happy,'' Buchwald said in a telephone
interview after a judge ruled Monday that Paramount must pay him
for the script idea he claimed was the basis for the hit Eddie
Murphy movie ``Coming to America.''
   ``This thing is not only an important thing for me,'' Buchwald
said. ``I think it's really important for writers.''
   Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider ruled that ``Coming to
America'' was ``based upon a material element of, or was inspired
by'' a synopsis Buchwald wrote entitled ``King for a Day.''

   Gov. Madeleine Kunin wants Vermont to
become the first state to ban all disposable diapers, but her plan
is being trashed by some including day-care operators who want no
part of a mountain of cloth.
   ``The time has come to be responsible and to find the way to say
yes _ yes to required statewide recycling, to bans on certain
polluting products, to changes in lifestyle,'' Kunin said in her
state of the state speech last week.
   Only Nebraska has banned disposable diapers, but it allows the
sale of diapers that are biodegradable, even though such products
aren't believed to break down in the depths of oxygen-starved dumps.
   Kunin, whose proposal would ban disposable diapers by 1993,
noted that while the usable life of a disposable diaper may be a
few hours, they won't decompose in dumps for hundreds of years _ or
several generations of babies later.

   Bit by bit and painfully, Americans began to
find some techniques for restraining government-sector debt during
the past decade. Meanwhile, private sector debt took off.
   The latter could become the big financial challenge of the 1990s
for households, farms and businesses. For some, there are
indications the bill burden already may be too heavy.
   Companies bought with debt find themselves strained in a
weakening economy. Farmers have seen the price of land _ collateral
for their loans _ decline. Many households have big mortgages. Many
banks have bad real estate loans.
   The comptroller of the currency has warned about a growing
number of tardy consumer loans, which include most personal,
automobile and credit card debt. Earlier, the American Bankers
Association issued a similar statement.
   The matter is being watched by regulatory officials and, of
course, by the Federal Reserve, but those who have studied the
growth attribute it more to changing lifestyles than any specific
economic cause.
   Research by the Conference Board, a private-sector research
group, shows private-sector assets of $29 trillion in 1988 after a
rise of 6.7 percent a year since 1980. But liabilities rose 10
percent on average to $7.4 trillion.
   That still left the private sector with a net worth of $21
trillion, but unless the pattern changed in the past year, which is
unlikely, net assets are continuing to erode.
   The Conference Board report shows that assets of non-financial
corporations rose 60 percent to $6.4 trillion from the beginning of
1980 and the end of 1988, but that liabilities rose 111 percent to
$2.7 trillion.
   Those figures brought the corporate liability-to-asset ratio to
42 percent in 1988 from 32 percent in 1980. The report said
interest payments consumed half the corporate pretax dollar in
1988, against 30 percent in 1980 and 10 percent in the 1960s.
   Conference Board economist Eva Culen said one danger in such
ratios is that big interest bills limit corporate flexibility in
recessions, ``raising the specter of additional unemployment and
plant closings.''
   While a proliferation of bank credit cards probably boosted the
household debt levels in the 1980s, the biggest dollar increase was
in home mortgage debt, which rose 30 percent from 1980 as a
proportion of assets.
   The value of houses rose sharply in the decade of the '80s, and
constituted nearly half the total tangible assets of households,
which also include cars, land, furniture, equipment and
inventories. But mortgage debt rose even faster.
   Regulatory officials have been restrained in their comments, but
they are concerned.
   Referring to the rising level of delinquency on consumer loans,
Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said this week his
office was seeking to determine ``precisely what this implies for
the overall condition of the national banking system.''
   The American Bankers Association said the number of consumers 30
days or more behind in loan payments soared to a 10-year high in
the third quarter of 1988. Delinquences rose to 2.88 percent from
2.3 percent three months earlier.
   Declining interest rates have taken some of the pressure off
borrowers, but lower rates also reflect a weakening economy that
eventually could be expressed in terms of rising unemployment and
shortened workweeks.
   Meanwhile, consumer borrowing appeared to surge during the
Christmas selling season. The Federal Reserve reported this week
that consumers borrowed $4.24 billion more than they paid off in
November.
   That increase, the biggest rise in outstanding consumer debt in
nine months, was said by some observers to reflect growing consumer
confidence. For some regulators, however, is was a warning sign.

   The electronic circus is coming to New Orleans
next week. Consider some attractions. ``What a Dummy.'' ``The
People of Beverly Hills Vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor.'' ``Monopoly.'' ``Trump
Card.'' ``TV Personals.''
   A few game-show revivals also will be there _ ``Name That
Tune,'' ``Joker's Wild,'' and ``Tic Tac Dough.'' So will a former
presidential candidate's debut in syndicated TV: ``Jesse Jackson _
Voices of America.''
   These are but a few of the 100 new shows afoot when the
convention of the National Association of Television Program
Executives starts Monday in the Big Easy. The city anticipates
9,000 conventioneers will be on hand for this annual festival of
show-selling to local stations.
   But convention officials don't expect a return this year of what
last year was the Big Controversy at NATPE _ ``tabloid TV.''
   The term refers to syndicated shows like ``A Current Affair''
and ``Geraldo,'' which report on and discuss tales of the tawdry,
the unseemly, and even the somewhat salacious.
   ``That kind of overwhelmed the whole thing,'' says NATPE
chairman Lon C. Lee, vice president and program manager of
NBC-owned KCNC-TV in Denver. ``I don't think you'll see that this
year.''
   Rather, he says, there'll be a lot of discussion about new game
shows and, generally speaking, ``I think you're going to see a much
broader selection of shows than in the past.''
   There still will be magazine and so-called information shows
being offered in syndication to local stations at the convention,
but they'll be of ``a softer kind than `Oprah' or `A Current
Affair' type of programming,'' one sales executive says.
   ``The new stuff is what I call kinder, gentler programming,''
explains the executive, Michael Levinton, programs vice president
for Blair Television, a national sales representative for 147 TV
stations.
   One example of what he means would be ``Only Yesterday,'' a
proposed weeknight information series created by former ABC News
executive Av Westin. It would be anchored by John Palmer, who left
NBC News last month after 26 years there.
   Each half-hour episode would be a two-part show, the first part
nostalgia, the second a given major story of yesteryear told by a
person who witnessed it, says Westin, who left ABC News last summer
after 20 years there.
   Westin now is senior vice president of reality-based programming
at King World, a major company that may make ``Only Yesterday,''
and syndicates ``Inside Edition,'' and such hits as ``Wheel of
Fortune'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   When at ABC News, Westin dispatched ``20-20'' crews to cover one
NATPE convention. But this will be the first he ever has attended.
This time, he's part of King World's bid to sign up stations for
``Only Yesterday.''
   ``Part of the continuing education of Av Westin in television
continues,'' he wryly says. ``The essential difference is at a
network, you could declare you were going to put a program ... and
you instantly have 209 stations.
   ``In the world of syndication, King World can declare anything
it wants. Then it's got to go out and sell it to 209 station
managers.''
   If one understands that each has his or her own idea on what
will work in a given market, he says, ``then in a way it becomes a
very fascinating challenge.''
   Westin says he probably won't know until after the week-long
convention ends whether ``Only Yesterday'' will go into production.
   Neither Levinton nor NATPE chairman Lee thinks the costly flop
of ``USA Today on TV'' will have an adverse effect on other
syndicated news and information series being offered next week. The
series was unique in that 156 stations bought it in 1988 without
seeing a pilot episode.
   ``I think they (station executives) perceived that this was a
bad attempt in a category that still is critical to stations,''
Levinton says.
   Lee, whose station didn't buy ``USA Today on TV,'' jokes that
``station buyers have very short memories.'' They may vow never to
buy a show without seeing a sample first, he says, but ``of course
we'll forget that lesson somewhere down the road.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   HISTORIC FIRST: THE SEQUEL _ On Jan. 18, ABC's ``PrimeTime
Live'' will have Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer reporting from
within the Kremlin. The program, ABC says, ``will have access never

<HEAD>Michael Landon Stars in Family Drama With Art Carney</HEAD>

   Michael Landon sat on the floor in the tiny,
darkened editing room and watched two key dramatic scenes in the
NBC movie ``Where Pigeons Go To Die.''
   On the monitor screen, Art Carney as ``Da'' lies motionless in a
hospital bed as his 10-year-old grandson, played by Robert Hy
Gorman, tells him about the performance of Dickens in a
homing-pigeon race. The boy is thrilled when his grandfather, who's
had a stroke, mumbles a few words.
   Then, the boy watches from hiding as he sees for the first time
that his own father, played by Cliff De Young, loves ``Da'' as much
as he does.
   It's an emotional moment, and even the editors, who've seen it
dozens of times, watch silently.
   Landon directed the movie, which airs Monday, and adapted the
screenplay from the book by R. Wright Campbell. He also narrates
and plays the adult grandson who returns 40 years later to sell his
grandfather's house and is overwhelmed by memories.
   It's the first thing Landon's done since completing the NBC
series ``Highway to Heaven'' last year. After more than 30 years in
television without a letup (``Bonanza'' 1959-73, ``Little House on
the Prairie'' 1974-83 and ``Highway to Heaven'' 1984-89), Landon
took six months off to travel and relax.
   ``I was having dinner one night with Melissa Sue Anderson, who
was on `Little House,' and her fiance,'' he said. ``She said she'd
read `Where Pigeons Go To Die' and thought I might like it. I did
and I bought the book. It had been around for a while. It had once
been optioned with John Wayne in mind for the grandfather.
   ``I loved the simplicity of the story. I loved the way the boy's
love of his grandfather is tied in with his pet homing pigeon. I
like the way the narration brings the story together. There are no
big-deal things going on _ just some little things, like the way
the boy sees his father shave his grandfather and sees his love,
too.''
   Landon said he felt particularly lucky that he was able to get
Art Carney, who won an Oscar for his role in ``Harry and Tonto'' in
1974. ``I'd always thought of him for the part of the
grandfather,'' he says. ``He's a lovely guy to work with.''
   The movie also brings Landon together with composer Leonard
Rosenman, who wrote the score.
   ``He wrote the music for `East of Eden' and I've been humming it
for 20 years,'' Landon said.
   Landon's producer, Kent McCray, and his wife, Sue McCray, his
casting director, sent a recording of the ``East of Eden'' theme to
Switzerland and had a special music box made. Landon collects music
boxes.
   The movie was filmed on location in Lawrence, Kan., and in
Kansas City.
   Landon said he's worked so often with animals that he had little
trouble with the pigeons, cat and hawk in the movie. He left it up
to his long-time animal trainer, Gary Gero, who went to Kansas
early to get the pigeons acquainted with the area.
   ``A pigeon is not exactly the Albert Einstein of the animal
world,'' Landon said, ``but Gary was able to get them to do some
remarkable things. He set up the big pigeon race where hundreds of
pigeons competed.
   ``He's extremely kind to the animals. I never want any animal
put in jeopardy and he feels the same way.''
   Landon, a former national high school champion javelin thrower,
began his long career as the title character in ``I Was a Teen-age
Werewolf.'' A number of television roles followed and then he was
cast as Little Joe Cartwright in ``Bonanza.''
   He began writing when the show was ready to shut down
temporarily because it didn't have a script. He wrote the script
over a weekend and later wrote many more episodes and began
directing on the popular family western. He wrote and directed most
of the episodes of ``Little House on the Prairie'' and ``Highway to
Heaven.''
   His son, Michael Landon Jr., played Little Joe's son in a next
generation ``Bonanza'' movie. He's currently studying at the
American Film Institute.
   Landon has seven grown children, two of them adopted. He and his
third wife, Cindy, have two young children. Last month the family
moved into a new 10-bedroom Malibu mansion at the end of a canyon
about one mile from the ocean.
   Few people in television have been as productive as Landon. He
lists among his hobbies ``writing scripts.'' Even on his six-month
rest, when he visited Tahiti and Hawaii, he still did some writing
and edited ``Highway to Heaven'' for syndication.
   At present, there's no new series in Landon's future.
   ``I like working on different projects,'' he said. ``I'm now
negotiating to set up my company at a studio. I've got a few
projects in mind, but nothing has been signed yet.
   ``I won't say never to another series. If something good comes
along it would be fun to get the crew together again.''

   Frank Lloyd Wright was a radical man, a man with a Utopian
vision. From the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York with its
spiral ramp to the Kaufmann House in Bear Run, Pa., built into a
waterfall, he was an architect and decorator who saw the beauty of
open space and married machinery to aesthetics.
   He believed architecture was organic, a bridge between people
and nature. He set no limits for himself, as is seen in a new
exhibit of his drawings at the Phoenix Art Musueum.
   The show, ``Frank Lloyd Wright Drawings: Masterworks From the
Frank Lloyd Wright Archives,'' features 303 original works dating
from 1887 to the 1950s.
   The works are on loan from the Archives at Taliesin West, a
national historic landmark in Scottsdale, Ariz., and cover
residential buildings, religious structures, high-rises, civic and
cultural buildings, hotels, resorts and commercial structures as
well as graphic and decorative design.
   ``Many of these drawings have not been seen for 50 years and
probably will not be seen for another 50,'' said Bruce Brooks
Pfeiffer, director of the Archives for the Frank Lloyd Wright
Foundation.
   The exhibit also includes notes the architect made on his
drawings years after he created them.
   ``The longer he lived, the more he returned to his earlier
drawings to make notes and comments on them, sometimes working on
the architectual lines themselves as well as adding text,''
Pfeiffer said.
   The exhibit runs from Jan. 13 to April 8.
   Another Wright exhibit currently is running at the Seattle Art
Musueum: ``Frank Lloyd Wright: Preserving an Architectual
Heritage.'' The exhibit includes more than 70 pieces of furniture,
stained glass windows, light fixtures and other decorative works.
It runs through Feb. 25 before traveling for two years to museums
in Chicago, Buffalo, Denver, Philadelphia and Dallas.

   The nation's leading commercial banks dropped their prime
lending rates a half percentage point to 10 percent, marking the
first reduction in nearly half a year and paving the way for many
cheaper business and consumer loans.
   The move Monday reflects the overall falling cost of money that
banks have enjoyed in recent weeks due to more liberal credit
policies by the Federal Reserve.
   The central bank moved to ease interest rates late in 1989 to
help forestall a dramatic economic downturn.

   The Supreme Court set the stage for a key
``affirmative action'' ruling, agreeing to study the special
preferences the federal government gives to television and radio
stations owned by women and minority members.
   The justices said Monday they will use a Florida case to review
the Federal Communications Commission's policy of treating such
ownership as a favorable factor when awarding licenses.
   In another case, the high court refused to force a revival of
the ``fairness doctrine,'' under which the federal government could
require radio and TV stations to present all sides of controversial
issues.

   President Bush struck a combative stance
for the 1990 congressional session, complaining ``it is past time''
for lawmakers to approve a capital gains tax cut and other White
House proposals left hanging last year.
   Saying a capital gains bill would be a top priority, Bush
declared Monday, ``I am sick and tired of the demagogues who call
this a tax cut for the rich. It means jobs, it means savings and it
is good for all Americans.''
   Many Democrats in Congress have opposed a reduction on grounds
the chief beneficiaries would be the wealthy.

   The number of corporate name changes declined
last year, but 1989 saw the creation of some prominent
double-barreled corporate nameplates, including Time Warner Inc.,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Bridgestone-Firestone Inc.
   And a man whose name seems to be everywhere got another entry in
the corporate lexicon as the Trump Shuttle replaced the Eastern
Airlines Shuttle.
   The number of corporate name changes declined 14 percent last
year to 1,600 from a record 1,864 in 1988, according to a survey
released Monday by Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc.
   Nevertheless, the 1989 total was the third highest in the 20
years that the corporate identity consulting firm has conducted its
annual survey, and was almost four times the 422 name changes in
1980.
   Mergers and acquisitions were the reason for 799 name changes or
50 percent of the total, reflecting the continued restructuring of
corporate America. In the decade's first year, only 25 percent of
name changes stemmed from mergers and acquisitions, the firm said.
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. made one of the year's
most publicized matches, but mergers in the pharmaceutical and
accounting industries also produced some predictable names.
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham Group PLC got together to
make SmithKline Beecham, Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Co. produced
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche
Ross became Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   ``While these new names are the result of combining well-known
names, if history is any guide many of these will later be
shortened,'' said Joel Portugal, a partner in the consulting firm.
   Other name changes illustrated the boom in foreign acquisitions
of U.S. companies. Stauffer Chemical Corp. became Rhone-Poulenc
Basic Chemicals Inc.; Pennwalt was changed to Atochem and
Westinghouse Elevator was reborn as Schindler Corp.
   But Bridgestone Corp. apparently saw extra mileage in a brand it
acquired in 1988. It rechristened itself last year as
Bridgestone-Firestone Inc.
   Divestitures, sales of assets, spin-offs and leveraged buyouts
led to 388 name changes, or 24 percent of the total, and corporate
reorganizations and changes to a holding company structure
accounted for 120 changes, or 8 percent.
   Ramada sold off its hotels and motels and retained its gaming
operations under the new name of Aztar Corp., NWA Inc. became Wings
Holdings Inc. after the Alfred Checchi buyout, and F.W. Woolworth
Co. streamlined its name to Woolworth Corp. when it became a
holding company.
   Another 258 companies or 16 percent of the total changed names
for reasons other than a merger, sale or reorganization. Among the
most prominent was Gulf &amp; Western Inc., which restyled itself as
Paramount Communications Inc.
   The greatest number of name changes occurred among manufacturing
and industrial companies, with 464 or 29 percent of the total. It
was the first time in the survey's history that industrial
companies made more name changes than financial institutions, which
accounted for 366 or 23 percent.

<HEAD>Rates Fall on Short-Term Treasury Securities</HEAD>

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.57 percent, down from 7.64 percent
last week. Another $7.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.44 percent, down from 7.52 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.55
percent on Dec. 4, 1989, and six-month bills averaged 7.43 percent
on Dec. 18, 1989.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.83 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,808.60 and 7.84 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,623.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for 1-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 7.82 percent
last week, up from 7.80 percent the previous week.

   It was the heyday of corporate takeovers and two
businessmen had visions of greatness.
   One, an Australian, saw himself atop a global brewing empire,
while the other, a Canadian, expected to become the most powerful
retailer in the biggest consumer nation in the world, the United
States.
   But their dreams clouded their judgment, allowing both men to
delude themselves and ignore obvious signs of trouble. Today, Alan
Bond and Robert Campeau are seeing their businesses slip away.
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., with interests in brewing, media,
natural resources and real estate around the world, has $6 billion
in debts. Its Australian brewing companies have gone into
receivership and its American brewer, G. Heileman Brewing Co. of La
Crosse, Wis., has had to cut a deal with its own creditors.
   Alan Bond did manage to win a reprieve last week, when an
Australian court turned down a government request to liquidate his
company. But he is still battling banks and receivers.
   Meanwhile, it is widely expected that Campeau Corp.'s sagging
U.S. retail divisions, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department
Stores Inc., will be forced to seek bankruptcy court protection
because they cannot make payments on $7 billion in debt held by
banks and bondholders.
   Last week, Robert Campeau lost 29 percent of his stock in
Toronto-based Campeau Corp. when two of his private companies
defaulted on bank loans.
   To some extent, both men were victims of economic circumstances:
Interest rates surged in Australia, taking a toll on Bond Corp.'s
business, and retail sales slumped in the United States, leaving
Campeau Corp. with little cash to meet its loan payments.
   But analysts who have followed the two companies say Alan Bond
and Robert Campeau would never have landed in such trouble if they
hadn't spent so much on the firms they acquired.
   When Bond bought Heileman for $1.22 billion in 1987, he wanted
the company so badly he paid a price that, even then, analysts said
was too high. Heileman already had been losing market share and
sales for a year.
   But when Bond launched his bid, he had a vision of the future,
which he described in a letter to Heileman management:
   ``Together Bond Brewing and Heileman would be the fourth largest
brewer in the world, enabling it to exploit markets beyond either
of our own reaches.''
   It didn't turn out that way. Heileman has sold its profitable
baking division and closed several plants, but still has $850
million in debts. And Bond Corp. said recently Heileman's cash flow
was not likely to be enough to make principal payments on its
long-term debt this year.
   Heileman is just part of Bond Corp.'s problems. Bond has
conceded that another acquisition, of part of the Australian firm
Bell Group Ltd., has also resulted in sharp losses.
   Robert Campeau was equally blind to the obvious. When the real
estate developer bought Federated for $6.6 billion in early 1988,
the entire U.S. retailing industry had been in a slump for more
than a year, and no one knew when it would turn around.
   But Campeau confidently shrugged off questions about whether the
company could handle its debt if sales didn't recover.
   Business didn't pick up, and Federated and Allied consistently
posted losses after they were acquired. Then, last September,
Campeau Corp. exploded a bombshell: It could not make the payments
on some of the high-yield junk bonds that it issued to help finance
its acquisitions.
   The news devastated the junk bond market and almost brought the
takeover business to a standstill.
   Robert Campeau was forced to give up control of his company to
another Canadian developer, Olympia &amp; York, in return for an
infusion of cash. He was also forced to put Federated's
Bloomingdale's chain up for sale.
   Ironically, Bloomingdales's was the chain upon which Campeau
hoped to build his retail empire.
   Bond and Campeau have both had notoriety in their personal lives
as well as in their business dealings.
   Bond is better known than Campeau in the United States _ perhaps
not by name, but by his stunning defeat of San Diegan Dennis Conner
during the 1983 America's Cup race, the first time the United
States had ever lost yachting's biggest prize.
   In 1987, when it came time to defend the cup, Bond's entry
failed to make it to the finals. Conner defeated another Australian
yacht and reclaimed the cup.
   Later that year, Bond won a battle of a different sort, paying
the highest auction price ever for a work of art: He was the
anonymous bidder who paid $53.9 million in 1987 for Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Irises.''
   As it turns out, Bond went into debt for that acquisition, too.
The auction house Sotheby's recently revealed that it had loaned
Bond $27 million toward the purchase price.
   Campeau was barely known in the United States even after he
bought Allied in late 1986. It was his two-month battle for
Federated that won him notice, although even after he had defeated
R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., many Americans still didn't know his name.
They did know, however, that a Canadian had bought Bloomingdale's.
   In Canada, where Campeau made his fortune as a developer, he is
quite well-known as a big party-giver in social circles in Toronto.
He has had many friends in the Canadian government, including the
popular former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

<HEAD>U.S. Will Push for Big Changes in Final Round of Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills says the
Bush administration will push for widescale changes as it enters
the final year of negotiations aimed at rewriting the rules of
global trade.
   She said Monday that eliminating trade-distorting agricultural
subsidies, which are costing billions of dollars worldwide,
remained a top priority but that the farm issue was only one of
several areas in which the administration is making efforts to
expand opportunities for U.S. exporters.
   ``I have a political imperative to get reform across the
board,'' she told a news conference.
   The Bush administration hopes to use the global trade
negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, as a way of expanding
export opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses and thus
resume shrinking the country's trade deficit, currently stuck above
$100 billion annually.
   The negotiations, involving the 96 member countries of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are due to conclude in
December. Hills said, however, that she hoped an agreement in at
least one key area, the rules guaranteeing market access, can be
worked out well in advance of the final deadline.
   She said that resolution of this topic is possible because
``there is no East-West or North-South split (between countries).
There are problems for everyone in the package and benefits for
everyone in the package.''
   Hills also listed a U.S. initiative to write rules covering
about $1 trillion in annual global trade that is either not now
protected by GATT rules or for which the current protection is
inadequate.
   She said the United States wanted GATT rules written to protect
trade in services, such as banking and insurance, and to strengthen
protection for intellectual property rights, an area in which some
studies have indicated that U.S. companies are losing between $40
billion and $60 billion annually because of piracy by foreign
companies.
   ``These are all areas where American entrepreneurs in the 1990s
and beyond are going to be super-competitive,'' Hills said.
   On the subject of America's huge trade deficit with Japan, which
accounts for more than half of the total U.S. imbalance, Hills gave
qualified praise for a recently announced Japanese package of
measures aimed at reducing the country's huge trade surpluses.
   The program, drawn up by Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, features a plan to offer tax incentives that would
reward Japanese companies that increase their imports 10 percent or
more from the previous year's levels.
   ``We will have to wait and see how that tax credit affects the
behavior of buyers, but it shows a certain resolve on the part of
MITI and we are grateful for that,'' Hills said.
   Hills is scheduled to meet in Washington this week with her
Japanese counterpart, Hikaru Matsunaga, the head of MITI, who will
also hold talks with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers.

<HEAD>Consumers Sank $4 Billion Deeper In Debt in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $4.24 billion more in
consumer credit than they retired in November, the largest increase
in their outstanding debt in nine months, the Federal Reserve said.
   Some analysts said the jump, announced Monday, reflected overall
consumer optimism despite pockets of sluggishness in the economy.
   ``It presents a clear picture that consumers are back on track
even if they had slowed down earlier in the year,'' said Michael K.
Evans of Evans Economics Inc. ``They're starting to spend again. We
also saw this in the Christmas sales which were pretty good.''
   The Fed said consumer credit in November advanced at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2 percent on top of a 5.4
percent gain in October. It was the highest level of consumer debt
since last February when $5.38 billion was posted.
   Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages.
   The pace of auto loans slowed to a 2.2 percent increase, or $519
million, on an annual basis reflecting the November slump in the
automobile industry resulting from an absence of sales incentives
and the presence of price increases for 1990 models that took
effect in October.
   Auto loans increased 4.1 percent in October, but analysts said
that reflected a lag in credit applications made in September but
not approved until the following month.
   Auto sales remained depressed until late December when car
buyers took advantage of incentives that expired at year's end.
   ``Consumers didn't like the prices and knew they would come
down,'' Evans said, describing the situation in the auto industry
as a pricing problem, not an economic one.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards jumped to a 17.2
percent annual rate of growth from a 6.6 percent rate in October.
Total revolving debt rose $2.8 billion, compared to $1.08 billion
the previous month.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose
$1.33 billion, an 8 percent annual rate of growth, compared with a
gain of $1.17 billion or 7.1 percent in October.
   Mobile home debts outstanding fell again, down $424 million or
22.2 percent. The rate of increase in these debts had fallen for
seven consecutive months until a one-month gain in September.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in November at a
seasonally adjusted $711.8 billion.

<HEAD>Boesky Partnership Liquidated, But Mountain of Litigation Pending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partners of Ivan F. Boesky's main arbitrage fund
are getting $248 million in liquidation proceedings, but attorneys
promise to continue pursuing a mountain of lawsuits involving the
fallen speculator.
   More than two dozen shareholder lawsuits and other litigation
against Boesky, his defunct partnership CX Partners LP and
affiliated entities are pending in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   The agreement between CX Partners and its 46 investors was
reached after more than three years of discussions dating to
Boesky's November 1986 settlement of insider trading charges with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   While the agreement is the first major resolution of a Boesky
civil matter, it doesn't mean lawyers are ready to settle other
litigation.
   ``It's going full-steam ahead,'' said David Berger, a lawyer for
shareholders in some class-action lawsuits against Boesky parties.
   ``We will be proceeding with depositions and preparing to go to
trial,'' added George Reycraft, who represents the limited partners
in the Boesky fund.
   Boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his alleged insider
trading activities. Most of the lawsuits are by shareholders who
were selling stock at the time Boesky and his associates were
buying.
   Also pending in the case that rocked Wall Street is completion
of an SEC plan to use $50 million paid by Boesky to reimburse
individual investors who can prove they were defrauded by his
trading.
   Under the agreement liquidating CX Partners, formerly known as
Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co., most of the limited partners received 100
percent of their investment, said David R. Herwitz, the
partnership's liquidating trustee.
   The total equity investment in the fund, which Boesky formed in
March 1986 to buy stocks of potential takeover targets, was $338
million. Its value dropped to $285 million when Boesky was charged
and has since grown to $335 million thanks to interest, Reycraft
said.
   But Boesky and his wife surrendered all their interests in the
enterprise and some partners did not receive full compensation.
People familiar with the case said the Boeskys' interest in the
fund totaled just under $10 million.
   The limited partnerships included insurance companies, financial
institutions and individual investors. Some future disbursements to
the partnerships are possible, Herwitz said.
   Guinness PLC, the largest holder in the fund with a $100 million
stake, received just $37 million of its claim, Reycraft said.
   Monday's settlement included an agreement with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., which had an $8 million equity stake in the Boesky
fund and owned $20 million of its debt.
   Reycraft said Drexel received the full $20 million for the debt
but no interest or any of its equity investment. Under the
agreement, Drexel will be dropped as a defendant in the
Boesky-related lawsuits, he said.
   But Reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed with
litigation against Boesky and others, including former Drexel
financier Michael Milken and admitted securities felons Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel.
   Boesky, 52, is due to be released in April from a Brooklyn
halfway house, where he is completing a three-year prison term.
Boesky pleaded guilty to one count of violating federal securities
laws and paid $100 million to settle charges he led a network of
illegal trading using inside information.
   The government is using $50 million of the money to compensate
investors who can prove they were victimized by Boesky's trading.
SEC officials had set Jan. 15 target date to establish a plan to
distibute the money.
   ``We are working toward achieving a plan for distribution of the
money but that may or may not have anything to do with an
investors' settlement,'' said John H. Sturc, an SEC associate
enforcement director.
   Herwitz, a Harvard law professor, said he expected some of the
lawsuits consolidated before U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack to
be resolved soon.
   ``Some of these lawsuits will be reduced, abated or limited,''
Herwitz said. ``Part of what is happening is people are going to
try to save a dollar or two on litgation costs.''

<HEAD>Two Men Settle SEC Inside Trading Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says
two Connecticut men have settled insider trading charges stemming
from Emhart Corp.'s tender offer for Stanadyne Inc.
   One of the two, who allegedly traded on inside information
obtained when the other opened somebody else's mail, agreed to pay
almost $20,000 in fines and penalties, the SEC said Monday.
   The misappropriated information concerned a 1988 tender offer
for Stanadyne, a Windsor, Conn., pump and faucet maker, by
Hartford-based Emhart, which makes tools and machinery.
   Stanadyne was acquired by FSLI Acquisition Corp. in February
1988.
   The SEC accused Thaddeus Pencikowski, 37, of Farmington, Conn.,
of making $9,093 in alleged illegal profits after buying 750 shares
of Stanadyne common stock Jan. 8, 1988, with confidential
information allegedly supplied to him by Bruce J. Warren, also 37,
of Plainville, Conn.
   Both men settled the civil charges without admitting or denying
wrongdoing.
   Pencikowski's lawyer, Vincent Dowling, was not in his office
when called for comment. Warren's lawyer, Steven Sach, declined to
comment until he spoke with his client.
   ``No financial penalty was sought for Mr. Warren, who did not
trade for himself,'' said Harry J. Weiss, an attorney with the
SEC's Enforcement Division.
   According to the SEC, Warren agreed to receive a Stanadyne
director's mail while the director was away. Warren's computer
graphics company and the director's office were in the same
building, which was owned and managed by Pencikowski.
   The SEC accused Warren of violating a ``duty of trust and
confidence'' to the Stanadyne director when he revealed to
Pencikowski the contents of a letter concerning the Emhart offer.
   ``The complaint alleged Mr. Warren misappropriated information
from the director and then tipped Mr. Pencikowski,'' said Weiss.
   Pencikowski allegedly bought 750 Stanadyne shares at $26.50 per
share on Jan. 8 and sold them for $39 a share on Jan. 11, 1988 _
the day the Emhart offer was made public.
   According to the SEC, Pencikowski agreed to disgorge $10,847 in
alleged illegal profits plus interest as well as a penalty equal to
his alleged profits of $9,093.
   Both men also agreed to the entering of a court order barring
them from breaking securities laws.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A burning issue behind the strike against
Eastern Airlines _ the transfer of some Eastern assets to parent
Texas Air Corp. _ is now the subject of negotiations that could
result in compensation being paid to Eastern.
   The special examiner in Eastern's bankruptcy proceeding has been
holding talks that could lead to restitution by Texas Air for
assets that could amount to millions of dollars, sources said
Monday.
   Attorney David I. Shapiro, the examiner appointed by the federal
bankruptcy court, noted in a document submitted recently to the
court that he has negotiated with Eastern on a possible settlement
related to the transferred assets, which include planes, routes and
other crucial segments of an airline operation. Shapiro declined to
comment on the matter Monday, as did Texas Air spokesman Art Kent
in Houston.
   But sources familiar with the talks, who asked not to be
identified, said the discussions were continuing.
   The unions representing pilots, ground workers and flight
attendants, who struck Eastern last March 4, have long accused
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo of siphoning off valuable Eastern
assets to its sister carrier, Continental Airlines, and to Texas
Air. The unions have demanded that a special trustee be appointed
to run Miami-based Eastern, replacing Lorenzo and top management.
   The strike virtually shut down Eastern and forced it to seek
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 9. Eastern pilots and flight
attendants abandoned their sympathy walkouts shortly before
Thanksgiving, but the Machinists union remains on strike.
   A union advocate charged Monday that a financial settlement
wouldn't be adequate to compensate Eastern for assets that he said
Lorenzo stripped from the airline.
   ``It is not a sufficient cure for that simply to pay some
bucks,'' said Bruce Simon, an attorney for the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``There should be a trustee.''
   Shapiro, a Washington attorney, has been conducting an extensive
financial investigation of Texas Air, Eastern and Continental since
early September. Shapiro and more than 20 associates have been
interviewing current and former officers of the companies, union
leaders and others.
   Shapiro is looking into past transactions between Texas Air and
its two main subsidiaries. They include the transfer of the System
One computerized reservation system from Eastern to Texas Air in
April 1987 for about $100 million.
   If the examiner's investigation found that price to be
inadequate, for example, he might ask Texas Air to pay Eastern the
difference between what it already paid for System One and a fair
market price, the sources said.
   Shapiro has told the court his inquiry has shown there may be a
conflict of interest stemming from Eastern and Continental having
the same owner. He recently said the key question is whether
Lorenzo has been treating the three companies as one airline. Last
month, Shapiro said he and his staff had interviewed about 70
people and examined more than 200,000 documents.
   Eastern has complained that the investigation's objectivity has
been compromised because a large part of the work has been
delegated to Eastern's unions.
   ``We may pursue it further,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell
said Monday, referring to the complaints. He declined to comment,
however, on the issue of negotiations with Shapiro on a possible
settlement.
   Shapiro recently said he has received a list of complaints from
Eastern's attorneys that contend the investigation has been almost
prosecutorial. The examiner said the magnitude of the task has led
him to delegate some work, such as interviews, to union attorneys
but that practice hasn't hurt objectivity.
   After having received several extensions, Shapiro is scheduled
to report on his investigation to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland in New York on Feb. 15. A hearing on the trustee issue also
is scheduled for that day.

<HEAD>UAL Board To Explore Recapitalization As Deadline for Buyout
Passes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. has instructed its financial adviser to
explore the merits of recapitalizing the airline company, a move
that could mean flying with a heavy debt load and increasing
internal turbulence.
   The move Monday came under pressure from Coniston Partners, a
New York investment concern that owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock
and has threatened to make a run at taking control of the company's
board of directors.
   Under this threat, Coniston said it wanted the company
recapitalized if there was no revised buyout proposal put together
by Monday.
   UAL, the parent of United Airlines, issued a statement after the
close of markets Monday saying that ``no employee ownership plan
has been put forth. ...''
   It said company directors told their financial adviser, First
Boston Corp., to come up with a proposal for the next UAL board
meeting on Jan. 25.
   UAL said in its statement that among the proposals it wants
studied is a plan that would involve an ``exchange offer of UAL
debt securities for a significant portion of UAL's outstanding
stock.''
   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty would not say how many of the 21
million outstanding shares might be involved in any
recapitalization. Nor would he expand in any other way on the
company's brief statement.
   There was no immediate response from the pilots union, which led
earlier attempts to put together an employee buyout. But the union,
as well as UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, has been known to oppose
recapitalization, partly because of the extra debt it might entail.
   Wolf reportedly told the pilots union that he might resign if
the company was forced to recapitalize.
   Three years ago, the airline went through a recapitalization
that added about $3 billion in debt. However, within a few years
this was cut in half with surplus revenue and proceeds from sales
of non-airline businesses.
   Over the past year, takeover talk has taken the Chicago-based
company for a bumpy ride.
   A pilot-management plan to buy the company for $6.75 billion, or
$300 a share, failed last fall when banks refused to finance it.
Since then, the value of a share of the company's stock has been
nearly cut in half.
   Last month, Coniston said it was dissatisfied with progress
being made toward a sale or restructuring of the company.
   It said that if there was no sale and if a recapitalization
proved unsatisfactory, it might revive its threat to seek
shareholder consent to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and take
control of the board.
   Officials of the investment concern could not be reached for
comment on UAL's decision to explore recapitalization. There was no
answer at Coniston's New York office late Monday.
   UAL said that if the board approves a recapitalization, it would
be implemented ``as promptly as practicable thereafter.''
   The statement said the board remains open to ``any appropriate
acquisition proposal from employees or any other party.''
   UAL stock traded as high as $294 a share amid the buying frenzy
that followed the plot-management group's offer last summer.
   The stock closed Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$156.62{, down $2.87{.

<HEAD>London Shares Little Changed At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London shares fought back from early lows to stand
little changed by midday Tuesday, helped by the return of light
buying interest and a more positive lead from the futures market.
   At noon London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 0.1 point, or 0.004 percent, at 2,431.2
points, but much improved from a morning low of 2,420.5 points, a
loss of 10.8 points.
   The market opened lower after sharp losses earlier in Tokyo.
With little buying interest emerging in the first two hours of
official trading, market makers swiftly knocked prices lower.
   But, by around 11 a.m., a stronger trend in the stock index
futures market helped the market turn around.
   ``We have seen a small, technically-inspired rally,'' one dealer
said.
   Most action, however, remained focused on blue-chip stocks.
   Volume came to 312.7 million shares by midday, compared with 209
million shares at the same time Monday.

<HEAD>JVC Announces Digital Sound for VHS Videos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   JVC has developed a method for recording
high-quality digital sound on VHS videotapes, a company official
said today, which should allow future Super VHS machines to match
or surpass compact disc players in sound quality.
   ``Digital sound is the wave of the future, so we have developed
a digital audio recording method for VHS,'' the official said.
   Digital recording allows greater dynamic range and lower noise
levels than conventional analog methods.
   Current VHS videocassette recorders use frequency modulation
(FM), a non-digital method, to record high-fidelity sound. The new
machines will record both FM and digital audio, making the tapes
and equipment compatible with earlier VHS machines, JVC said.
   Prototypes using the new technology have been developed, but no
date has been set for marketing, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The price is expected to be higher than for current Super VHS
equipment. Super VHS, introduced in 1987, uses special tapes and
circuitry to provide higher-quality pictures than normal VHS.
   Currently, VHS machines record video and FM audio signals on two
different layers of the videotape's magnetic coating in a technique
called depth multiplexing. The digital sound information will be
recorded on the same layer as the FM signal, JVC said.
   The company, whose formal name is Victor Co. of Japan, is the
original developer of the VHS format and a member of the Matsushita
Group, which makes Panasonic and Technics products.
   The JVC official said the new technology would allow direct
recordings from other digital sources such as satellite broadcasts.
Japan's public broadcasting network, the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
(NHK), broadcasts television programs with digital sound directly
from a stationary satellite.
   However, direct digital recordings from compact discs will not
be possible without an adapter.
   The company said it expects a wide range of applications for the
new technology, from general consumer goods to professional
equipment.

<HEAD>Bridgestone-Firestone Seeking Hundreds of Employee Buyouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. has given hundreds
of workers nationwide until Jan. 31 to decide whether to vacate
their jobs in a company cost-cutting move, a company spokesman said.
   The company confirmed Monday that it has begun a voluntary
program to reduce the number of white-collar employees.
   Bridgestone-Firestone is the ninth-largest employer in Akron
with 1,825 employees. After steady declines since 1977, the number
of Firestone Akron workers has increased slightly the last two
years.
   Company spokesman Bob Troyer would not say whether there is a
reduction goal. However, he said that Bridgestone-Firestone
``hoped'' the departures would alleviate the possible need for
layoffs.
   Troyer said salaried employees are being offered two weeks of
pay for every year of service with the company.
   An employee with 15 years of experience, for example, could
receive 30 weeks of pay spread out over 30 weeks.
   Firestone facilities included in the buyout program are in Akron
and Brook Park, Ohio; Russellville, Ark.; Decatur, Ill.; Des
Moines, Iowa; Oklahoma City; Wilson, N.C.; and Noblesville, Ind.

<HEAD>Continental Announces New Regional Super-Discount Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines says it will offer one-way
tickets to and from Texas cities for as low as $9 to fill seats
that otherwise would go empty.
   The airline said response was brisk and at least two other
carriers were considering today whether to follow the low fare lead.
   ``It's a whole lot more productive to put somebody in a seat at
$9 or $19 than to have that seat go empty,'' said John Nelson,
Continental's executive vice president of marketing.
   The announcement Monday came just days after Continental
announced it was raising fares by 4 percent.
   Dubbed ``TexSavers,'' the new fares are good on Tuesday and
Wednesday for travel between all Texas cities Continental serves,
except El Paso, and for travel between Houston and New Orleans,
Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
   The fares are expected to increase the Houston-based carrier's
revenue by about $3 million to $4 million a month, Nelson said.
   The lowest fare available _ $9 one-way _ will be for travel from
Houston on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to New Orleans and throughout
Texas, except El Paso, Nelson said. The cost for travel between
Oklahoma City and Tulsa from Houston is $19 one way, and the cost
for Texas flights involving El Paso is $39 one way.
   Travel on the Thursday-through-Monday flights from Houston to
New Orleans and throughout Texas except El Paso is $19 one-way, $24
one-way for Oklahoma City and Tulsa. One-way fare between El Paso
and another Texas city is $49.
   Unrestricted fares are marked at $39, $59 and $79.
   The new fares require a 21-day advance purchase, are
non-refundable and are subject to availability. Nelson said 5,000
seats a day on 112 flights have been earmarked for the new fares.
   ``We are having one of the busiest nights ever in Texas,''
Continental spokesman Ned Walker said Monday night. ``Calls are
coming in from consumers for these fares. The phones are ringing
off the wall. No one's ever seen fares like this in Texas.''
   He said the new fares are effective indefinitely. Problems with
booking the low fares after the first two-day period resulted from
``some of the other carriers having a minor glitch in loading fare
information into computers.
   ``That will be resolved in the next two days,'' said Walker.
``These fares are real.''
   Southwest Airlines, a no-frills regional carrier based in
Dallas, may be the competitor most affected by the fare cuts. The
majority of Southwest's business comes from connecting Texas cities
with each other and surrounding states.
   Southwest is considering the fares but has not decided whether
it will match the cuts, said spokesman David Brown. Officials at
Fort Worth-based American Airlines also said they were studying the
reductions.
   ``We were deluged with calls from travel agents. The agents said
that they were not able to book the $9 fares after the first
Tuesday-Wednesday period,'' said Brown.
   ``I am not saying that it (the Continental announcement) is a
sham, and only for two days, but it is highly unusual that a
carrier would make this kind of an announcement and then have those
flights only available for that limited a period,'' he said.
   Southwest last week lowered fares for people over 65, putting a
$79 cap on one-way fares, although some are as low as $19. On Dec.
19, Southwest put a $99 cap on one-way, advance-purchase fares.
   The new rates come a week after the airline announced a 4
percent increase in fares across the country due to higher fuel
costs.
   Nelson said Continental, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air
Inc., is implementing the new fares to encourage travelers to fly
instead of drive on their next trip.
   Eastern Airlines, Continental's sister carrier, last week
announced fare cuts of up to 45 percent to 65 cities and eliminated
the usual cancellation penalties.
   Eastern said Monday it also was raising some fares 4 percent to
help cover fuel costs, but its new discount fares are exempt from
the increase.
   Continental and Eastern are the main subsidiaries of
Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company.

<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp. President Anthony
Terracciano has been chosen to head New Jersey's largest banking
company, First Fidelity Bancorp. of Newark, effective Feb. 1.
   Tearracciano's appointment, announced by both companies on
Monday, ends a year-long search for a chairman to replace Robert R.
Ferguson Jr., who is set to retire on Feb. 28.
   Ferguson will continue to serve as a First Fidelity director.
   A career banker, Terracciano, 51, worked for Chase Manhattan
Bank for 23 years before joining Mellon as president in 1987.
   In a written statement Monday, Terracciano said he was assuming
his new post ``with the knowledge that Mellon's momentum will not
be interrupted.''
   ``Mellon is, simply, on a solid course,'' he said.
   Pittsburgh-based Mellon, one of the nation's largest bank
holding companies, has assets of around $31 billion. Through its
subsidiaries, it provides wholesale, middle market and retail
banking as well as a number of service products, including trust
and investment, data processing and cash management.
   First Fidelity is the parent company of First Fidelity banks and
Morris Savings bank in New Jersy, and of Fidelity Bank and
Merchants banks in Pennsylvania. The company has around $30 billion
in assets and about 500 offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>New Court Documents Outline Case Against Bean Traders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court document filed by prosecutors outlines
the government's case against a soybean trader accused of cheating
customers out of $150,000 in dealings at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Martin Dempsey, 52, is accused of shifting more than $60,000 in
trading losses to FBI agent Richard Ostrom, who worked undercover
as a corrupt bean trader, using the name Richard Carlson, a
document filed Monday indicates.
   Dempsey, of suburban Glen Ellyn, Ill., repaid the losses through
embezzled customer funds funneled to Ostrom through illegal
prearranged trades, according to the document filed with U.S.
District Judge George Marovich.
   The document claims Dempsey stole ``more than $150,000...through
agent Ostrom and other accomodating traders.''
   Dempsey has pleaded innocent to charges against him.
   In the document, prosecutors revealed for the first time that
seven months before his indictment in August, Dempsey admitted
engaging in illegal trading.
   Dempsey is among 18 soybean traders and one clerk from the Board
of Trade's bean pit who were indicted in the federal probe, which
netted indictments against a total of 48 people from the CBOT and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest commodities
exchanges.
   Five bean traders and the clerk pleaded guilty. Dempsey and 12
others are scheduled to go on trial on June 12, and the 30-page
document filed Monday outlines the government's case against the 13.
   Ostrom, armed with undercover tape recordings of trading pit
action, is expected to testify in the soybean trading case.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today proposed that the
Comecon trading bloc begin trading on a hard currency basis at
world prices next year to end four decades of isolation from the
world economy.
   The proposal came on the first day of a private meeting of
Soviet and Eastern European leaders, joined by leaders of Mongolia,
Vietnam and Cuba. East European leaders welcomed the idea but said
it should be implemented slowly.
   Comecon officials who briefed reporters after the session said
the Soviets suggested hard currency trading at world market prices
begin in 1991, replacing trading in the non-convertible Soviet
ruble.
   Members of the 10-nation Soviet-led trading bloc, founded in
1949, have agreed that a radical overhaul is needed if the group is
to survive and keep pace with changes under way in Eastern Europe,
where democracy is taking hold and members are abandoning central
planning.
   Vladimir Dlouhy, a reform Communist who chairs Czechoslovakia's
state planning commission, told reporters the Soviet proposal would
be ``a disaster'' if introduced immediately and said a transitional
period is essential.
   Poland's non-Communist premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki said the
transition period for fuels and raw materials should run until
1995. Other trade should be carried out on the basis of bilateral
agreements, Mazowiecki said.
   Moscow's East European allies traditionally have relied on
Soviet raw materials as their chief source of fuel and raw supplies
for their industries.
   Today's meeting was the first since last month's ouster and
execution of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the decline of
Communist power elsewhere in Europe.
   ``Comecon is an obsolete organization. It has never worked and
doesn't work now,'' Romania's interim Premier Petre Roman said
Monday. ``Comecon must adjust and change if it is to continue.''
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov told reporters after an
initial closed-door session: ``There is no danger of Comecon
falling apart.''
   His assessment of the future of the 10-nation group was
partially shared by Czechoslovak Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, who
told reporters, ``Comecon will survive in one form or another.''
   Klaus has warned that his country would unilaterally cancel its
Comecon commitments unless its transactions are based no longer on
the Soviet ruble but on a convertible currency that can be freely
exchanged on the world market.
   That view is shared by Romania's new leaders, who have closed
ranks with Hungary's reformers and Poland's Solidarity-led
government in calling for an end to trade based on fixed quotas and
prices, barter and the ruble.
   Founded in 1949, Comecon _ the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance _ provided Josef Stalin's Soviet Union with a mechanism
for extracting favorable trade agreements from client states.
   Forty-one years later, the Soviet Union under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has cut loose Warsaw Pact states it once kept in the fold
by force and Comecon will thus crumble if the trade relationships
within it are not reforged.
   Trade relationships within Comecon had been based on agreements
between state-owned industries in centrally planned economies that
did not work. Comecon must now either adjust to the dismantling of
such economic systems _ already well under way in Poland and
Hungary _ or perish.
   The meeting's agenda included coordination of economic plans for
the next five years, which would at the outset create a conflict.
   Ryzhkov has presented an orthodox, centrally planned program for
the next five years for the Soviet Union, while most East European
countries are abandoning central planning in favor of the free
market.
   Critics say the trade bloc has recently been nothing more than a
means for its member states to survive the free-market evils of an
increasingly competitive world economic system.
   The bloc has not been held together by Socialist solidarity,
they say, but by members' inability to earn enough hard currency to
buy energy and raw materials from anywhere but the Soviet Union.
   Now, all that is changing, as East bloc countries led by Hungary
embark on extensive trade with the West.
   Hungary announced last week it would cut its exports to the
Soviet Union by 20 percent. Czechoslovakia and Poland last week
decided to establish bilateral trade agreements and link their
currencies, the crown and zloty, bypassing the ruble.

<HEAD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Takes Fourth-Quarter Charges of $690 Million
After Taxes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf pvs, `The large ...' to CORRECT figure to $740
million from $790 million.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. today announced it is
taking two fourth-quarter charges that will total about $690
million after taxes as it continues the process of blending two big
pharmaceutical companies.
   The larger charge, an estimated $740 million before taxes, will
be taken as part of a plan to integrate newly merged businesses and
reorganize on a worldwide basis.
   It will cover the costs of reducing the number of plants and
employment levels. It also will be used to pay for employee
relocations and related expenses, the company said in a news
release. A company spokesman said a small percentage of the work
force will be cut but exact numbers were not yet known.
   There will be an additional fourth-quarter charge of $115
million for the costs of professional fees and other expenses
related to last year's merger of the formerly separate companies
Bristol-Myers and Squibb.
   The union was completed in October after stockholders approved
an $11.5 billion tax-free stock swap between the two companies,
creating the second largest pharmaceutical concern behind Merck &amp;
Co.
   The two charges will reduce after-tax income by about $690
million, the company estimated.
   Financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31,
are due to be released later this month. Company spokesman Dan
McIntyre said he couldn't say whether the charges would cause
Bristol-Myers Squibb to report a loss for the fourth quarter.
   The two predecessor companies had combined profit of $1.1
billion, or $2.10 a share, through three quarters of 1989. That was
up 14.4 percent from $961.5 million, or $1.83 a share, in the first
nine months of 1988. Combined sales totaled $6.8 billion, up 6.5
percent from $6.4 billion in 1988.
   Chairman Richard L. Gelb said Bristol-Myers Squibb is on the way
to realizing the benefits of the merger that was announced in July.
   He said the coordination of sales and marketing activities and
the performance of the combined pharmaceutical research and
development effort promised to fulfill the business opportunities
that were anticipated.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb expects that savings from joining
administrative and manufacturing functions will provide resources
to invest in various businesses and to help offset the per-share
earnings dilution that the merger caused, Gelb said.
   McIntyre, a company spokeswoman at the New York headquarters,
said the extent of the employment cuts hasn't been determined yet.
The company has about 53,000 employees.
   He said it was anticipated that reductions would amount to a
small percentage of the work force.
   A freeze on new hiring has been in place since the merger was
announced over the summer.
   Bristol-Myers makes Excedrin and Bufferin pain relievers,
household products and numerous prescription medicines.
   Squibb makes and markets a wide variety of prescription drugs
and has an extensive research and development operation.

   A nine-week strike by workers at a plant owned by
British Aerospace PLC will force Airbus Industrie to shut down its
production lines in the coming days, the head of the European
commercial aircraft consortium said Tuesday.
   Jean Pierson predicted that thousands of workers at plants in
Britain, France, Spain and West Germany will be laid off
temporarily because of the strike at the British Aerospace plant at
Chester, England, which makes wings for the Airbus family of
commercial jets.
   Pierson, meanwhile, also announced that Airbus had record sales
in 1989 of 421 aircraft worth a total of $34 billion,
   Pierson said the consortium already has cut back the rate of
production of its A320 short-to-medium range jet to 1.2 a month
from a peak of seven a month in early November. If this hadn't been
done, the assembly line at Toulouse in southwest France would have
been shut down at the end of November, he said.
   Pierson told a press conference that if he had known the British
Aerospace strike would last so long he would have shut down the
assembly line sooner.
   The British Aerospace workers are striking over their demands
for a 35-hour work week. British Aerospace management is refusing
to negotiate until the strikers go back to work.
   The standard work week for manual workers at British Aerospace
is 39 hours, but they work on average an extra six hours a week in
overtime to meet production schedules.
   Airbus Industrie's chief executive criticized management for
allowing the strike to drag on.
   ``Part of the art of good management is in being able to handle
labor relations,'' he said.
   Pierson said problems created by the strike will tarnish the
consortium's credibility as well as have financial repercussions
for the Airbus partners, Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany, British Aerospace
Plc and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
   Airbus Industrie currently has four A320s and a similar number
of wider-bodied A310s on its production lines at Toulouse. Even if
the strike ends now, he said, the consortium faces two months
without any new wing assemblies.
   The situation could have consequences for Airbus's market share,
Pierson said, noting that customers are being told they will have
to wait longer before taking delivery.
   Pierson acknowledged that 1989 was an exceptional year for the
commercial aircraft industry, and predicted that the rhythm of new
orders would moderate in 1990.
   He said the consortium expects to take in orders for between 270
and 300 planes in 1990, well up from the 167 aircraft sold in 1988.
   Stuart Iddles, senior vice-president for the group's commercial
operations, said it was difficult to get a clear picture of the
market prospects for 1990 because of uncertainties over the
start-up of programs at McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing
Commercial Aircraft Corp. in the United States.
   But he said it was likely that Airbus Industrie would be able to
expand its market share to close to 30 percent in 1990 from 22.5
percent in 1989 and 16 percent in 1988. Boeing was the only other
manufacturer with a bigger market share last year.
   Airbus Industrie's 1989 revenue was approximately $5 billion,
Pierson said, adding that the consortium showed its first-ever
profit from financial operations of $60 million.
   The Airbus chief executive confirmed that an independent report
commissioned by the consortium recommended the final assembly of
the A320 narrow-bodied short-to-medium airliner should remain at
Toulouse, in southwest France.
   This could put an end to a yearlong controversy over West
Germany's efforts to get the A320 production line transferred to
Hamburg.
   The Airbus supervisory board has requested supplementary
information from the report's authors, and the issue will be
decided when the board meets on Jan. 26 in Toulouse.

<HEAD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Taking Charges of $690 Million After Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Tuesday it is
taking two fourth-quarter charges totaling about $690 million after
taxes as it continues the process of blending two big
pharmaceutical companies.
   The larger charge, an estimated $740 million before taxes, will
be taken as part of a plan to integrate newly merged businesses and
reorganize on a worldwide basis.
   It will cover the costs of reducing the number of plants and
employment levels. It also will be used to pay for employee
relocations and related expenses, the company said in a statement.
A company spokesman said a small percentage of the work force will
be cut but exact numbers were not yet known.
   There will be an additional fourth-quarter charge of $115
million for the costs of professional fees and other expenses
related to last year's merger of the formerly separate companies,
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp.
   The union was completed in October after stockholders approved
an $11.5 billion tax-free stock swap between the two companies,
creating the second largest pharmaceutical concern behind Merck &amp;
Co.
   The two charges will reduce after-tax income by about $690
million, the company estimated.
   Financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31,
are due to be issued later this month. Chairman Richard L. Gelb
said operating results continued strong during the fourth quarter.
   The two predecessor companies had combined profit of $1.1
billion, or $2.10 a share, through three quarters of 1989. That was
up 14.4 percent from $961.5 million, or $1.83 a share, in the first
nine months of 1988. Combined sales totaled $6.8 billion, up 6.5
percent from $6.4 billion in 1988.
   Gelb said New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb is on the way to
realizing the benefits of the merger that was announced in July.
   He said the coordination of sales and marketing activities and
the performance of the combined pharmaceutical research and
development effort promised to fulfill the business opportunities
that were anticipated.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb expects that savings from joining
administrative and manufacturing functions will provide resources
to invest in various businesses and to help offset the per-share
earnings dilution that the merger caused, Gelb said in the
statement.
   Company spokesman Dan McIntyre said the extent of the employment
cuts hasn't been determined yet. The company has about 53,000
employees.
   He said it was anticipated that reductions would amount to a
small percentage of the work force. A freeze on new hiring has been
in place since the merger was announced over the summer.
   Bristol-Myers makes Excedrin and Bufferin pain relievers,
household products and numerous prescription medicines. Squibb
makes and markets a wide variety of prescription drugs and has an
extensive research and development operation.

<HEAD>Bond Corp. Comments On Preliminary Talks With Texan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. said Tuesday it has held
preliminary and very tentative talks with a young Texas businessman
who is seeking control of the financially struggling company in
return for a $197 million investment.
   ``It's really wait-and-see,'' said an official spokesman at
company headquarters in Perth of the offer by Jeff H. Reynolds.
   ``We've had some preliminary contact for some time in the form
of some phone calls and correspondence,'' said the spokesman, who
asked not to be named. ``I am not in a position to say more. He's
there, we're here. When things are clearer...if there are more
substantive talks, then we can comment.''
   Reynolds, who says he heads a firm called Weatherby Investments
Inc., is an apparent newcomer on the international investment
scene. He has said he planned to visit Australia to talk to Bond
and was prepared to take out citizenship here to seal a deal,
thereby overcoming any obstacles over foreign investment in
Australian media.
   The 28-year-old Texan said in a news release last week that he
was negotiating with Bond Holdings, Bond Corp.'s Australian holding
company. However, little is known about Reynolds or his companies,
which U.S. officials said Monday did not appear to be publicly
traded as he contends.
   Bond Corp. was founded by Alan Bond, a former America's Cup
winner and multimillionaire entrepreneur whose dealings span
brewing, natural resources, property and media. The company is
reeling under debts of almost $6 billion and is fighting legal
battles that have included placement of the brewing interests into
receivership.
   Among those battles was an attempt by the State Government
Insurance Commission of Western Australia (SGIC), which claims it
is owed money by Bond, to liquidate the entire company.
   Last Friday, the Supreme Court of Western Australia rejected the
SGIC's petition.
   Late Monday, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. launched a counter-action
claiming unspecified damages over the SGIC's failed attempt to
liquidate Bond Corp.
   Bond Corp's wholly owned subsidiary Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd.
is continuing a legal fight in the Supreme Court of Victoria State
to have a decision to appoint receivers set aside.
   Any money awarded as damages in the SGIC claim would help Bond
Corp. overcome its immediate debt problems. Bond has been selling
off assets to reduce debts.
   Elsewhere, Bond Corp. subsidiary Bell Resources Ltd. (BRL) was
questioned late Monday by the Australian Stock Exchange about Bond
Corp's intended sale of its brewing assets to BRL.
   BRL said it could not comment on a proposed timetable of events
because of the current legal action in the Supreme Court of
Victoria.

   McCaw, which will buy a 50.1 percent interest in LIN for $3.38

   LIN, in turn, will buy $425 million of McCaw's stock and
distribute it as a dividend for LIN shares not purchased in the
tender offer.
   McCaw said it had extended its tender offer to expire at noon on
Feb. 27, but that could be extended further if all conditions of
the offer have not been satisfied. About 13.8 million LIN shares
have been tendered so far, McCaw said.

<HEAD>Mercedes and Kodak Are Top Quality, Volvo Drivers Most Loyal,
Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American consumers believe Mercedes and Kodak
stand for top quality, although Volvo drivers are more loyal to
their cars, a study of brand perceptions says.
   Coke and Pepsi are dead even in terms of perceived quality, but
the Pepsi generation seems more satisfied with its cola. And while
Toyota owners are among the most loyal of any brand-name devotees,
the average American feels that Buick offers more quality.
   Total Research Corp., a Princeton, N.J.-based market research
firm, surveyed consumers age 15 and older in 1,000 households for
their attitudes on 91 brands in categories ranging from cars to
candy bars.
   The study of brand recognition and quality perception, also
known as brand equity, found that Campbell soup was the most
recognized brand, with 98 percent of those surveyed having some
feeling about Campbell.
   Hallmark greeting cards and McDonald's restaurants followed
closely with 97 percent recognition.
   Mercedes and Kodak topped the list of perceived quality with an
average rating of 84 from consumers with a feeling about the
brands. The ratings are on a scale ranging from zero for poor or
unacceptable quality to 100 equals extraordinary quality.
   Other brands rating at or above 80 in perceived quality included
Fisher-Price toys, Hallmark, Levi's jeans and IBM personal
computers.
   But in the rank of perceived quality among users of a given
brand, Volvo came out on top with a rating of 98, topping Mercedes
at 94.
   The survey also indicated strongly polarized views about Toyota.
The Japanese carmaker came in third in quality ranking among brand
users with a rating of 93. But among consumers who recognize the
brands, Buick had a higher perceived quality rating than Toyota, 69
to 66.
   Among other conclusions, Total Research said consumer response
toward Advil showed strong growth potential, with a quality
perception among users of the pain reliever higher than quality
perceptions among consumers who recognize the brand.
   Other brands with a similar growth profile included Volvo, ESPN
sports cable network, Estee Lauder and Revlon cosmetics, American
Express, Fuji film and Magnavox.
   Kellogg's Corn Flakes showed the classic signs of a declining
brand _ highly recognized but average in perceived quality and
lowly rated in user satisfaction. Others showing a declining
profile included Nestle's Crunch, Sears stores, Holiday Inns, Blue
Cross-Blue Shield insurance, Schick razors and Lipton soup.
   Coke and Pepsi both made the top 10 of most recognized brands,
but Pepsi drinkers gave their cola a quality rating of 88 while
Coca-Cola drinkers rated their brand slightly lower at 85.
   The survey also found that consumers still love International
Business Machines, even if stock market investors don't. IBM
personal computers ranked second behind Kodak in terms of
consistency of consumers' quality ranking.
   At the other end of the scale, MTV, the music cable channel, had
the least consistent quality ranking, as well as the lowest quality
rating among consumers.

<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices closed lower and soybeans
were higher Tuesday in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade,
as weakness in the wheat market spilled over into other markets.
   The action in the wheat pit was disappointing the Soviet Union
did not reappear in the market after making an overnight purchase
of 480,000 metric tons of wheat, said analyst Dale Gustafson of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, released
Monday, also dragged down wheat prices. The forecast called for
improved chances of rain in hard red winter wheat growing areas.
   Gustafson said the weak tone of wheat spilled over into the rest
of the market.
   Corn prices fell due to slack demand, with analysts noting that
commercial houses were on both sides of the market and for small
amounts.
   Soybean futures were higher as the transportation problems
created by December's cold weather cleared up. A lack of additional
export business and overnight selling by farmers weighed on prices,
analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.07 a bushel; corn was a { cent
lower to a \ cent higher with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were a

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. said Tuesday its
fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped nearly ninefold to $1.23
billion, reflecting gains from the $3 billion sale of its financial
services unit to Ford Motor Co.
   Earnings also rose for the entire fiscal year, which ended Oct.
31, as the box office success of movies like ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade'' helped offset the cost of an unsucessful bid for
Time Inc.
   Paramount, which changed its name from Gulf &amp; Western Inc. in
June, said per-share net income for the final quarter was $10.28.
That compared with earnings of $144.0 million, or $1.12 per share,
the same time a year ago.
   Fourth quarter revenue rose to $968.8 million from $935.6
million.
   Paramount said the quarterly results included a $1.2 billion
gain from the sale of Associates First Capital Corp., the nation's
third-largest independent finance company, to Ford for $3.35
billion, and $279.4 million of earnings from the unit's operations.
   For the year, Paramount earned $1.47 billion, or $12.21 a share,
on revenue of $3.4 billion. That was nearly four times higher than
the previous year's net income of $384.5 million, or $3.21 per
share, on $3.1 billion in revenue.
   The annual results reflected a $48.3 million after-tax charge
for costs incurred in Paramount's failed bid for Time, which has
since merged with Warner Communications Inc., and an $84.3 million
charge from publishing operations for the adoption of new
accounting procedures.
   They also included a one-time gain of $7.4 million from the sale
of two small units of the publishing subsidiary Prentice Hall.
   Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis said fiscal 1989 was ``a
transition year.''
   ``We completed the restructuring we launched in 1983 and emerged
as a strong communications company with operations solely in
entertainment and publishing,'' he said in a statement.
   ``Armed with substantial cash and significant borrowing capacity
... we have the financial strength to fuel the global growth of our
businesses,'' he said.
   Davis said Paramount recorded its second-best operating income
in fiscal 1989 due to the popularity of movies such as ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade'' and ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of
Police Squad'' in U.S. markets, and ``Coming to America,'' ``The
Accused'' and ``Crocodile Dundee II'' in foreign markets.
   Theater operations posted increased operating income, primarily
reflecting a gain froom the January 1988 sale to Warner of 50
percent of the company's domestic theater circuits.
   Television operations declined modestly, reflecting an expected
decrease in series syndication income compared with fiscal 1988,
which included the availability of ``Webster'' in domestic
syndication.
   Publishing operations, excluding the charge, posted lower
results as modest gains in higher education, school and
international operations, were more than offset by declines in
consumer and supplementary education publishing and profesional
information.
   Consumer publishing posted lower operating income due to higher
expenses despite brisk sales of such paperback best sellers as
``Rock Star'' by Jackie Collins and ``It's Always Something'' by
Gilda Radner.
   The Madison Square Garden unit suffered declining operating
income due partly to the closing of the facility for renovations
last summer.

<HEAD>Restructuring To Cost Control Data $210 Million More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restructuring costs at Control Data Corp. for
1989 will surpass $650 million when an expected $210 million charge
is booked for the fourth quarter, the computer company said Monday.
   Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief executive
officer, said the write-offs will lead to a loss in the fourth
quarter, adding to the net loss of $484 million in the first nine
months of 1989. Exact results will be announced at the end of this
month.
   About half of the expected fourth-quarter charge of $210 million
will stem from VTC Inc., a small computer-chip subsidiary that has
never been profitable in its five-year history, said Nancy Foltz, a
company spokeswoman. Control Data said it expects to sell
Bloomington-based VTC this year.
   The subsidiary, which employs about 400 people, produces
computer chips for several high-security government computers.
   Other fourth-quarter charges stem from foreign currency
adjustments from the sale or discontinuation of some overseas
holdings and the writing down of some intangible assets, the
company said.
   Previous write-offs were due largely to the shutdown in the
second quarter of Control Data's supercomputer subsidiary, ETA
Systems, and the streamlining of the company's mainframe computer
business. Those moves cost the company $476 million.
   But the restructuring costs in the second and fourth quarters
will be offset by a restructuring gain of $18.9 million booked in
the first quarter from the sale of assets and the settlement of a
lawsuit.
   In the third quarter, the sale of the company's disk drive
subsidiary, Imprimis, resulted in a restructuring gain of $8.5
million after sale proceeds of $33.7 million were offset by charges
of $25.2 million.
   Perlman also Control Data's banks have agreed to waive the
effect of some of the fourth-quarter charges so that the company
can meet the net worth test specified in its credit agreement. The
agreement defines specific quarterly operating earnings the company
must meet.
   Perlman said Control Data expects operating profits in the
fourth quarter to improve from the third-quarter level of about
$20.6 million. But he did not give specifics.
   Since 1984, Control Data has been hit with $1.4 billion in
write-offs. The company managed a net profit of $1.7 million in
1988 and $19 million in 1987, but lost a total of $832 million in
1986 and 1985.

   Prices fell in dull trading on Wall Street today
as the stock market was unable to sustain Monday's mild rally.
   Analysts said the market could not find a direction in the
absence of any news. No economic indicators are scheduled to be
released until the end of the week, and many traders were also
waiting for fourth-quarter earnings reports before making any major
commitments.
   The market drifted for much of the session, with the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials trading in a narrow range. Then, during
the last half-hour, a burst of program trading steepened the
market's losses, and the average finished with a decline of 28.37
at 2,766.00.
   On Monday, when the Dow Jones average rose more than 21 points,
most of the gain was also attributed to late program trading.

<HEAD>General Foods To Warn Viewers of Taste Test Fiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of Sanka acknowledged Tuesday that a
national ad appearing to show an impromptu taste test for the
decaffeinated coffee was really staged with actors mouthing
prepared lines.
   General Foods USA said it will alter its ad following an
agreement with a Massachusetts state official who criticized the ad
as misleading.
   ``Viewers have come to expect that participants in any taste
test are real consumers stating their honest opinions, and not paid
actors extolling the product with comment supplied to them by the
advertiser,'' said Mary Ann Walsh, the state's secretary of
Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation.
   The ads, which air nationally, will have the word
``dramatization'' superimposed at the bottom of the screen for
three seconds as the commercial begins, according to the agreement
between Walsh and General Foods.
   ``We really do not think that any changes in the commercial are
required, either by testimonial guidelines or for the protection of
the consumer,'' said General Foods spokesman Cliff Sessions. ``But
in a spirit of cooperation we are adding the caption, and to avoid
any possibility of viewer confusion.''
   Set in a New Jersey railroad station at 7:14 a.m., the
commercial features people stopping at a table set up with Sanka
cups and containers.
   ``This is great,'' says one person. ``What is this?'' others
add. ``Delicious.'' ``You know this smells really good.'' Says
another: ``No way, this isn't Sanka.''
   Federal guidelines apply to commercials that identify the person
approving the product, or those which make competitive claims,
Sessions said. Sessions said the Sanka ad does neither.
   General Foods, Young and Rubicam, the company's advertising
agency, and all three networks approved the ad before it aired,
Sessions said.
   General Foods is located in White Plains, N.Y., and parent
company Philip Morris Cos. is based in New York City, as is Young
and Rubicam. Nevertheless, Walsh took on the food company because
the ads air frequently in Massachusetts, she said.
   Walsh's office phoned the Federal Trade Commission's local
office about the case, but continued to negotiate with General
Foods on its own.
   Bill McDonough, a staff attorney for the FTC's regional office
in Boston, said action by state officials on a case often can
preclude federal involvement.
   ``We feel as long as somebody does it, that's the main thing. If
we found a state has acted, and there is action by the advertiser,
it wouldn't be necessary for us to act,'' McDonough said.
   The ads have been running for about six weeks. Sessions declined
to comment on how long the campaign would continue.

   The dollar ended mixed Tuesday against key
foreign currencies in active, choppy trading.
   Gold gained after falling in Europe and strengthening in Asia.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $404.20 a troy ounce, up $1.20. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $405.60, up
$3.80.
   Robert Ryan, a currency trader with the Bank of New York, said
the dollar started out sharply higher amid concerns that ethnic
unrest in some of the Soviet Union's republics would force Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to resign.
   But it moved off its highs for the day on profit-taking and
other technical factors, he said.
   The dollar is often seen as a safe haven for investors in times
of political instability.
   Dealers said the dollar also gained some support from comments
by the West German central bank president, Karl Otto Poehl, that
there would be no further realignment of exchange rates within
European currencies.
   Italy devalued the lira on Friday within the European Monetary
System and traders said more realignments would have further
strengthened the West German mark to the detriment of the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 144.97 Japanese yen from 144.52 yen
Monday. It traded at 145.20 yen in London, and at 144.92 yen in New
York, up from 144.15 yen.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling cost
$1.6540 in London, up from Monday's $1.6530, and $1.6585 in New
York, up from $1.6535.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6730 West German marks, up from 1.6685; 1.5145
Swiss francs, down from 1.5245; 5.7025 French francs, up from
5.6965; 1,251.25 Italian lire, up from 1,250.00; and 1.16035
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6823 West
German marks, up from 1.6685; 1.5260 Swiss francs, up from 1.5235;
5.7305 French francs, up from 5.6920; 1.8970 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8880; 1,257.75 Italian lire, up from 1,249.00; and 1.1610
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1599.
   Gold bullion fell in London to $403.50 an ounce from $404.75
late Monday. The closing bid in Zurich was $403.50 an ounce, down
from $404.05.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 70 cents to close at $402.26 an
ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.234 a troy ounce, down a penny from
Monday. Silver fell in London to $5.24 an ounce from $5.28.

   Petroleum futures prices rose Tuesday as the
energy market rebounded from three days of heavy selling.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline made the most dramatic comeback on
the New York Mercantile Exchange while prices of crude and home
heating oil ended with more moderate gains.
   The contract for February delivery of unleaded gasoline regained
2.40 cents and finished at 60.88 cents a gallon. The contract had
skidded 8.75 cents over the three previous sessions. Contracts for
delivery during March, April and May closed with increases of 1.03
cents, 1 cent and 1.40 cents, respectively.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc, No. 2
heating oil for February delivery rose 0.72 cent to 65.05 cents a
gallon, offsetting a portion of Monday's drop of 3.50 cents. March
heating oil added 0.47 cent to 59.87 cents a gallon and later
delivery months posted similar gains.
   The February contract of West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude oil, went up 45 cents to $22.07 per 42-gallon
barrel after falling $1.46 on Monday. Other delivery months also
ended higher.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker and analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the rebound came as a sort of
reflex action after the big three-day sell-off sparked by warmer
weather and profit-taking.
   ``It seemed to be a good old-fashioned short-covering rally
after the steep declines we've seen in recent days,'' he said.
   Short covering involves buying back a commodity that previously
has been sold.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. asked a federal
judge Tuesday to cut the number of votes needed to fire directors
of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in the proxy battle between the
rival paper companies.
   Great Northern has resisted Georgia-Pacific's unsolicited $3.8
billion tender offer, saying it is illegal on antitrust grounds.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific has said the Great Northern board
should be fired because its members are trying to protect their own
high-paying jobs at the expense of shareholders.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said in court
papers that the rival company'sboard provisions are ``manifestly
designed to insulate incumbent directors from the wishes of the
company's shareholders.''
   Georgia-Pacific asked U.S. District Judge Gene Carter to reduce
the number of shares needed to oust the Great Northern board from
three-fourths to two-thirds. Georgia-Pacific contends that Great
Northern is in violation of Maine corporate law by requiring the
higher number.
   Stephen Hill, a spokesman for Great Northern, which is based in
Norwalk, Conn., but incorporated in Maine, said the latest
Georgia-Pacific filing ``has no merit.''
   Materials filed with the motion included a list of 16 potential
candidates that Georgia-Pacific would like to see on Great
Northern's board, 10 of whom are Georgia-Pacific executives.
   Hill said Great Northern would issue a proxy statement soon
``that will tell our side of the story.''
   Georgia-Pacific previously had solicited shareholders to call a
meeting to oust Great Northern's board. A meeting is set for March
2.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Overturns Warner Insurance Licensing Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' highest court ruled Tuesday that
the courts and not the state should decide whether a subsidiary of
Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. can sell insurance in Massachusetts.
   The complex case stemmed from a 1987 decision by Fireman's Fund
to withdraw from Massachusetts, primarily because of concerns over
sagging auto insurance profits.
   That move came without prior notice. Fireman's Fund allowed its
Massachusetts insurance license to expire and it also withdrew from
the Commonwealth Automobile Reinsurers, the high-risk pool for auto
insurance.
   The state Insurance Division advised Fireman's Fund it could not
unilaterally abandon the Massachusetts market on less than one
day's notice and filed suit in Superior Court.
   On Nov. 13, 1987, Fireman's Fund, the auto insurance pool and
the state Insurance Division signed a settlement agreement that
ended the suit filed by the state and a countersuit filed by the
insurance company.
   The insurance commissioner said at the time that Fireman's Fund
could not return to Massachusetts without state approval, and the
company did not dispute that point, Supreme Judicial Court Justice
Ruth Abrams said in Tuesday's decision.
   The settlement also contained language that said Fireman's Fund
would stop selling insurance in the state and provided for a $45
million payment to the insurance pool.
   Following the settlement, Fireman's Fund dismantled its
Massachusetts operation.
   But on Sept. 29, 1988, a wholly owned subsidiary, National
Surety Corp., a party to the settlement agreement, bought Warner
Insurance Co., an Illinois insurance corporation licensed in
Massachusetts to write most insurance, but not auto policies.
   After a hearing, the Insurance Division revoked Warner's
license, contending the purchase violated the settlement agreement.
   The insurance company appealed, and argued that the Superior
Court was the proper forum for the dispute to be resolved. The
Supreme Judicial Court agreed.
   ``The insurance statutes do not give the commissioner authority
to make a binding interpretation of a contract to which he is a
party or to determine conclusively whether the other party has
violated that contract,'' Abrams wrote.
   The Supreme Judicial Court sent the case to the Superior Court
for further action.
   Abrams said if there was no violation, the revocation of
Warner's license was not proper. If there was a violation, she
said, the Superior Court might conclude that a proper remedy would
be for either Fireman's Fund to sell Warner or for the revocation
of Warner's license to stand.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Officials Ready to Officially Merge Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after officials of Time Inc. and
Warner Communications Inc. first talked about combining their
businesses, the two companies are sealing their $14 billion merger
and forming the world's largest media concern.
   But the Time Warner Inc. that will be created when the deal
officially closes Wednesday is vastly different from the company
Time Chairman J. Richard Munro and Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross
once envisioned.
   Time Warner is expected to have $11.4 billion in revenue this
year, putting it ahead of the West German firm Bertelsmann AG as
the world's biggest media company.
   But the new company will be burdened with nearly $11 billion in
debt, mostly as a result of the merger, which supplanted Time and
Warner's initial plans for a debt-free stock swap.
   Its high leverage is expected to put a crimp in some of Time
Warner's plans.
   ``It would have been a hell of a company if they didn't have all
the debt,'' said Fred Anschel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Peter Appert, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence-Morgan Grenfell,
said the debt load makes Time-Warner ``a more risky proposition in
a slowing economic environment, particularly if interest rates move
up.''
   Analysts predict Time Warner earnings will be depressed for at
least two years while it reduces its debt, but they generally
expect the company ultimately to flourish.
   Although Appert was concerned about the company's debt, he also
said, ``I think the company will do quite well.''
   Said Anschel: ``The businesses they're in are strong
cash-producing businesses'' and Time-Warner should be able to pay
down its debt as long as it remains well-managed.
   Warner brings properties that include its highly-successful
Warner Bros. film and television studios, Warner Bros. and Atlantic
records divisions, Warner Cable business and its publishing arm,
which includes Warner Books and DC Comics.
   Time's main businesses are magazine publishing, including Time,
Sports Illustrated, and People magazines; book publishing,
including Time-Life Books Inc. and Book-of-the-Month Club Inc.; and
cable television, including Home Box Office Inc. and American
Television and Communications Corp.
   Last March, Time and Warner announced that after two years of
on-again, off-again talks, they would merge in an exchange of stock.
   But on June 6, less than three weeks before shareholders were to
vote on the merger, Paramount Communications Inc. launched a $10.7
billion hostile offer for Time.
   The bid, later raised to $12 billion, forced Time and Warner to
transform their stock-swap deal into a $14 billion tender offer by
Time for its would-be partner. Paramount also took Time and Warner
to court in Delaware in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the
Time-Warner combination.
   On July 24, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a lower court
ruling allowing the merger to proceed. Time's tender offer expired
hours later, and in the so-called front end of the offer, Time paid
$70 in cash for about half of Warner's 200 million outstanding
shares.
   Time also changed its name then to Time Warner Inc., but Warner
Communications remained a separate entity pending Wednesday's
closing of the deal. At the closing, Warner shareholders were to be
issued securities for the balance of their holdings and Warner
stock was to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange at the
end of the day.
   Munro and Ross will serve as co-chairmen and co-chief executive
officers of the merged company. After both eventually retire, N.J.
Nicholas Jr., Time Warner's president, is expected to head Time
Warner.
   Many observers have questioned whether the two-chairman idea can
work, especially with the strong personalities involved. Munro and
Ross say that since they negotiated the deal and weathered the
Paramount storm together, they can run the company side-by-side.
   Anschel predicted that ``at least for a couple of years it's
going to work _ unless something comes up where they start
disagreeing.''
   But there are likely to be few rough spots right now, Anschel
said, because Munro, Ross and Nicholas agree that ``the first
priority is to reduce their debt.''
   To some observers, a big uncertainty is the price of Time Warner
stock. During its fight against Paramount, Time asked shareholders
to reject the $200 a share cash offered in the Paramount bid, and
profit in the longterm as Time Warner stock rises.
   Analysts expected the stock _ which closed at $116.75 a share
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange _ to rise, but it may take
some time.
   ``If they demonstrate that they're making progress in terms of
cash flow and debt reduction, I think the stock will rise
gradually,'' said Dean Witter's Anschel.
   Appert also said he expected the stock to make money over time,
but not in the near term.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Climb in Volatile Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices climbed Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in trading that saw heating oil prices swing wildly before
finishing with a modest gain.
   On other markets, soybeans were higher while grains fell;
livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures mixed; and
precious metals were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 45 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in February at $22.07 cents a
barrel. Heating oil was .45 cent to .72 cent higher with February
at 65.05 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 2.4 cents
higher with February at 60.88 cents a gallon.
   Analyst Bob Baker of Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in New
York said heating oil futures were up about 250 points before
turning negative and then closing with a modest gain.
   Meanwhile, gasoline prices climbed steadily to post a strong
gain.
   Baker attributed the volatility in the heating oil market to
speculative trading and the entrance of bargain hunters.
   Expectaions that the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventory data would show a decline in distillate and gasoline
stocks helped boost prices.
   After the close of trading, the API released data showing
gasoline stocks were down 6.4 million barrels and distillate stocks
down 423,000 barrels. Crude oil stocks were up 418,000 barrels.
   Tuesday's trading reversed three days of selling spurred by
easing concern over cold weather and reports OPEC production surged
beyond the levels set last year by the cartel.
   Grain futures prices closed lower and soybeans were higher in
quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The action in the wheat pit was disappointing because the Soviet
Union did not reappear in the market after making an overnight
purchase of 480,000 metric tons of wheat, said analyst Dale
Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, released
Monday, also dragged down wheat prices. The forecast called for
improved chances of rain in hard red winter wheat growing areas.
   Corn prices fell due to slack demand, with analysts noting that
commercial houses were on both sides of the market and for small
amounts.
   Soybean futures were higher as the transportation problems
created by December's cold weather cleared up. A lack of additional
export business and overnight selling by farmers weighed on prices,
analysts said.
   Wheat was 1} cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $4.06} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to a \ cent higher with March at
$2.38} a bushel; oats were a } cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$1.49{ a bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to 2 cents higher with
January at $5.70{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures were mixed
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weaker wholesale prices and lower cash prices put pressure on
cattle futures, according to analyst Tom Morgan of Research Corp.
in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork belly futures continued the rally that began last week when
the U.S. Agriculture Department issued a quarterly hogs and pigs
tally that showed far fewer animals than traders expected.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent lower with February at
76.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with January at 84.65 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with Feburary at 51.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .90 cent higher with February
at 55.60 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures were mixed on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold traded in a narrow range, before finishing higher as the
value of the dollar showed signs of weakening, said analyst Craig
Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. Silver
declined in sluggish trading.
   Gold was $1.20 higher with February at $406.20 a troy ounce;
silver was 1 cent to 1.6 cents lower with March at $5.298 a troy
ounce.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has relaxed rules on
technology transfers, removing obstacles to importation and lifting
limits on royalties, according to published reports Tuesday.
   Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said the revised
regulations are aimed at encouraging modernization of technology
used in Mexican businesses and reducing obstacles to acquiring that
technology abroad.
   He said previous regulations had left Mexican business
investment in technology ``as much as 90 percent less than that in
other, more developed countries.''
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made modernization his
slogan. In little more than one year in office, he has lifted most
restrictions on foreign investment, stepped up the program of
returning state-owned business to the private sector and continued
opening domestic markets to imports in an effort to force the
long-protected local industries to compete.
   Among other measures, the new rules, which took effect Tuesday,
eliminate the 3 percent to 6 percent limit on royalties, allowing
companies to make any payment agreement they wish, newspapers said.
   The new regulations also are designed to increase patent
protection and assure foreign companies that their products will
not be pirated. Protection of intellectual property rights has been
has been a major irritant in U.S.-Mexico relations.
   The regulation broaden provisions for protection of ``industrial
secrets,'' letting companies extend the period of confidentiality
on transferred technology. Other provisions reduce the paperwork
involved in registering patents and trademarks.
   Claudio X. Gonzalez, a presidential adviser on foreign
investment, said the changes should allow Mexico to attact more
foreign investment and better technology and make the country more
competitive abroad.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Tuesday accused two California men of illegally trading on
confidential information from advance copies of Business Week
magazine.
   The defendants are William N. Jackson, of Long Beach, Calif., a
former employee of a Business Week printer, and Brian J. Callahan,
of Anaheim, Calif., a former broker in the Anaheim office of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The civil complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles,
seeks $39,000 in alleged profits from the two men and fines triple
the profit of $117,000.
   The SEC, in a news release from its New York office, said the
case was the fifth civil action _ three of which have been settled
_ alleging trading on information in advance copies of Business
Week. Criminal charges also were filed in some of the earlier cases.
   According to the complaint, Jackson had access to advance copies
of the magazine through his job at R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., which
printed Business Week at a plant in Torrance, Calif.
   Jackson allegedly traded on 49 companies mentioned in the
magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column between July 1987 and July
1988 and shared the information with his brothers, the SEC said.
Jackson and his brothers allegedly made $19,506 in profits.
   The complaint said Callahan approached Jackson about opening an
account at Prudential-Bache in April 1988, after learning that
Jackson had advance information from Business Week.
   The SEC said Jackson told Callahan the names of companies
mentioned in upcoming issues of the magazine. Callahan allegedly
purchased securities of seven companies, earning a profit for
himself of $1,148 between April 1988 and July 1988.
   The complaint said he also used the information to place orders
for his customers, who profited by at least $18,535. The SEC
alleged Callahan benefited by his customers' trading because he
earned commissions.
   The case is not the first involving employees of R.R. Donnelley.
In August, a former salesman at the company's Torrance plant,
Shayne A. Walters, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and settled
SEC civil charges that he traded on advance copies of Business
Week. Walters awaits sentencing.
   Also, William Dillon, a former broker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
was sentenced to six months in prison for similar charges. The
government charged that he paid various employees at an R.R.
Donnelley plant in Connecticut for advance copies of the magazine.

<HEAD>Mexico on Brink of Final Agreement With Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and its creditor banks are on the
brink of completing a debt renegotiation that will allow the
country to resume growth after years of stagnation, Mexico's top
debt negotiator said.
   ``It's like an aircraft at the end of the runway. You move your
flaps. You're committed,'' Angel Gurria said.
   Gurria, assistant treasury secretary for international financial
affairs, said more than 98 percent of nearly 600 commercial banks
have signed on to the debt renegotiation package, terms of which
were agreed upon last July.
   The package should be ready for a formal signing before the end
of the month, said William R. Rhodes, the Citibank banker who has
led bank creditors in the negotiations.
   The renegotiation would cut $7.5 billion from Mexico's $48.5
billion commercial bank debt and knock nearly $2 billion from the
country's annual interest bill of $9 billion.
   ``We're less than $1 billion away from actually having all the
money there committed,'' Gurria said in an interview last week with
The Associated Press. ``Of the $1 billion, we know where $800
million stands.''
   Mexico is the first country to renegotiate its debt since
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady outlined a new U.S. policy
offering to forgive some debt if countries make serious efforts to
reform their economies.
   Under Mexico's package, creditor banks have three options:
forgiving 35 percent of the principal of their loans; leaving
principal intact but reducing the interest rate to 6.25 percent,
below market levels; or providing new loans equal to 25 percent of
the bank's existing loans to Mexico.
   Gurria said 42 percent of the banks have agreed to the principal
reduction, 48 percent will lower interest rates and the remaining
10 percent will provide new loans.
   The number of banks opting for the third option is lower than
negotiators had hoped. As a result, Mexico and the banks are about
$300 million short of the money needed to guarantee repayment of
debts, a key part of the plan, according to a banker involved in
the negotiations, who requested anonymity. That gap won't delay the
completion of the package, though, he said.
   ``A $300 million shortfall is manageable,'' the banker said.
   Gurria said completion of the package requires formal approval
by boards and committees of some creditor banks.
   The creditor banks still have ``a couple of weeks'' to study the
documents before signing them, he said.
   Mexico's $96 billion foreign debt, which includes debts to
foreign governments, is the second-largest among developing nations
after Brazil's $110 billion. Brazil has not paid interest on its
debt for months.
   Mexican officials have said the agreement will allow Mexico to
pay 2.7 percent of its gross national product to service foreign
debt, instead of the 6.3 percent it has paid out in recent years.
   Agreement on the terms of the renegotiation last July was a key
to restoring confidence in the Mexican economy, which grew 3
percent last year after seven years of recession or stagnation.
Inflation was held to 19.7 percent in 1989, down from 159 percent
in 1987.

   A late burst of program selling sent prices into
a broad decline on Wall Street Tuesday, capping an otherwise
lackluster session.
   Stocks had meandered lower for much of the day in the absence of
any news to stimulate trading, but computerized sell orders in the
last half-hour increased the market's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 28.37 to 2,766.00,
wiping out a more than 21 point gain the previous session that was
also largely attributed to program trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
565 up, 959 down and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.21 million
shares, up from 140.11 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.94 million shares.
   Analysts said the market lacked the support necessary to sustain
Monday's moderate gains, which followed the major banks' lowering
of their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.
   Traders were unable to look to any economic indicators for
guidance. The next scheduled government reports are December
producer prices and retail sales, both to be announced on Friday.
   Analysts said many traders were also waiting for companies'
fourth-quarter earnings to be announced before making any major
commitments.
   ``They're waiting for numbers or some sign that the market's
going to make a sustained move in either direction,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   He described the market as having ``no sense of urgency.''
   One standout in Tuesday's trading was UAL, which shot up 7&rsqb; to
164 after the parent of United Airlines said it was considering a
recapitalization.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb fell ~ to 55{. The company announced it is
taking fourth-quarter charges totaling about $690 million after
taxes as it continues the process of combining two big
pharmaceutical companies.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Pan Am, which
rose &lsqb; to 3|.
   Among blue chip issues, General Electric fell 1&rsqb; to 64|, AT&amp;T
was off { at 45\, and Exxon was off 1 at 48{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $32.1 billion, or 0.94
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.98 to 193.35.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.55 to 401.54, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 4.17 at 349.62.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.94 to 456.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 380.44, down 1.18.

   Japan's top trade official on Tuesday disputed the
perception that Japanese markets are closed to foreign business and
blamed the United States' high budget deficit and low savings rate
for worsening for the nation's trade problems.
   ``The openness of the Japanese manufacturing market is
comparable with the United States already,'' said Hikaru Matsunaga,
minister of international trade and industry.
   U.S. industry and government officials contend that access to
Japan's market is limited severely and is a key contributor to the
U.S. trade deficit.
   The Japanese government last month outlined a package of tax
incentives, tariff eliminations and other measures that officials
said was aimed at reversing past trade policies and making Japan an
importing powerhouse in the 1990s.
   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry expects to
the measures to eliminate discrepancies between the costs of
products in Japan and abroad, make the Japanese distribution system
more efficient, and lead to the breakdown of the ``keiretsu''
system in which many Japanese companies are clustered in tightly
knit groups.
   All of those issues are on the table in the U.S.-Japan
negotiations to deal with such alleged ``structural impediments''
to trade.
   Matsunaga said in a speech to business leaders that Japan's
imports of manufactured goods already had increased 39 percent in
1988 and imports from the United States grew 34 percent.
   ``I hope that the facts of this rapid increase in Japan's
imports are understood and will inspire foreign businesses to
challenge the expanding Japanese market, which in fact holds
immense potential benefits for them,'' he said through an
interpreter.
   Matsunaga visited Dallas before heading to Washington, where he
will meet with government trade officials, including U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   Matsunaga attributed much of the U.S. trade deficit to
``macroeconomic'' policies, including low savings incentives and
the budget deficit.
   ``I am expecting to see the United States making efforts to cut
its budget deficit and strengthen its industrial competitiveness,
and to enhance supply capacity,'' he said. ``I'm sure that measures
to raise the savings rate ... would be extremely beneficial.''
   The Bush administration is considering a proposal for providing
tax breaks on savings. The high Japanese rate of savings often is
cited as a factor in that nation's relatively cheap supply of
capital.
   Matsunaga, who described Japan as a free market, also criticized
what he said is an increasing move toward protectionist policies in
the West. He said he is especially concerned that Europe will
become a closed market in 1992, when internal trade barriers within
the Common Market are eliminated.

<HEAD>New Wide-Body Passenger Jet To Get First Test Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11, a new
wide-body jetliner based on the DC-10, is scheduled to make its
maiden flight Wednesday, six months behind schedule but with the
aerospace giant's hopes flying high.
   The first test flight of the MD-11, the first new tri-jet
introduced since McDonnell Douglas' DC-10 and Lockheed' L-1011 two
decades ago, will take place only if weather is clear at Long Beach
Airport.
   The 350-passenger MD-11 is just one of several aircraft programs
on which the St. Louis-based aerospace and defense company has run
behind schedule, including the 150-passenger MD-80 jetliner and the
C-17 military cargo plane.
   Many of McDonnell Douglas' problems stem from the worldwide boom
in commercial aircraft orders, which also has overtaxed production
at rival Boeing Co.
   The MD-11 is ``quite important to McDonnell Douglas,'' said
Lawrence Harris, and aerospace analyst with the Bateman Eichler
Hill Richards brokerage in Los Angeles.
   ``The successful certification of the MD-11 will generate a
significant portion of Douglas' revenues over the next several
years,'' he said.
   The company has 118 orders and 194 options for MD-11s, which
Harris said will cost about $90 million each. Under the most
optimistic schedule, the company could have the plane tested,
approved and 10 jets delivered by the end of the year, he said, but
that is unlikely.
   The maximum non-stop range for the standard MD-11 is up to 8,039
statute miles with 323 passengers and bags.
   The planes include the quieter, more energy efficient
high-bypass engines made by General Electric Co., Rolls Royce and
Pratt &amp; Whitney. Customers will be able to choose the engine maker;
the engines on the plane to be tested Wednesday were made by GE.
   The MD-11 is about as long as two-thirds of a football field,
and several companies have expressed interest in a stretch version
that would be 35 feet longer, about the size of a Boeing 747. No
decision has been made on whether to produce the longer version,
spokesman Keith Takahashi said Tuesday from the company's Douglas
Aircraft division in Long Beach, where the plane is made.
   The MD-11 looks much the same from the outside as the DC-10,
although minor streamlining changes have been made in the tail, the
end of the wings and the stabilizers. The avionics, cockpit and
interior are new.
   It will compete against the A-330 and A-340 jetliners being
manufactured by the European consortium Airbus Industrie, which
also carry about 350 passengers and cost about the same. Boeing's
777, to be introduced in the mid-1990s, will also compete with the
MD-11s.
   ``McDonnell Douglas is counting on the Douglas unit to generate
profit growth in the years ahead because of the likelihood of a
flattening defense budget and the significant commercial backlog
that exists for both the MD-80 and the MD-11,'' said Harris, the
Bateman Eichler analyst.
   He said 1990 would be a transitional year for McDonnell Douglas,
whose earnings fell during the first nine months of fiscal 1989.
   ``It's still an open question as to how many (MD-11s) can be
delivered, and the bottom line will be affected by development
expense,'' which could rise if test flights reveal serious
problems, Harris said.
   The program for the smaller MD-80 appears to have ``turned the
corner'' into profitability, he said.
   Meanwhile, the C-17 program is still in development amid close
scrutiny. The Air Force recently moved the first flight of the C-17
fron the end of this year to mid-1991.

   Ralston Purina Co. said Tuesday it will
establish a new division designed exlusively to serve its specialty
pet food segment and provide a greater push for its premium Pro
Plan pet foods.
   Pro-Visions Pet Specialty Enterprises will market Pro Plan
products to pet shops, feed stores and veterinary offices, Ralston
Purina said.
   Scott R. Harris, the new division's managing director, said
Pro-Visions will unveil a new line of pet food for special dietary
uses that will be distributed through veterinarians.
   The new product line, Clinical Nutrition Management, is expected
to be available by midyear. It results from a multimillion-dollar
research and development program, in part at veterinary
universities, to meet special dietary needs of dogs and cats with
specific health conditions.
   Ralston Purina is the world's leading producer of dry dog food
and dry and moist cat food. It also owns Continental Baking Co.,
the nation's largest wholesale bakery, and is the nation's leading
manufacturer of batteries with its Eveready and Energizer labels.
Ralston Purina sales totaled $6.6 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Suzuki To Set Up Joint Venture Car Plant in Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suzuki Motor Co., Japan's largest minicar producer,
said Tuesday it has reached an agreement with Hungary to set up a
joint venture car plant near Budapest.
   The agreement will be signed in Budapest on Friday between
Suzuki Motor President Osamu Suzuki and Hungarian representatives,
company officials said.
   Masabumi Yayoshi, a Suzuki spokesman, said the project would
make his company the first Japanese automaker ever to open
operations in Eastern Europe. Suzuki first bagan discussing the
project with Hungarian authorities in 1985, he said.
   The $138.9 million plant in Esztergom, 25 miles north of
Budapest, will produce Suzuki Swifts, small passenger cars based on
Suzuki's Cultus, Yayoshi said.
   Capitalized at $71.4 million dollars, the joint venture company
would be owned 50 percent by Autokonszern, a Hungarian firm, 30
percent by Suzuki Motor and 10 percent each by the Washington-based
International Finance Corp. and C. Itoh and Co. Ltd., one of
Japan's three largest general trading firms. IFC is a World Bank
affiliate that finances private projects.
   Yayoshi said production would begin in 1992, expanding from
15,000 cars in the first year to 50,000 cars in the third. Annual
capacity eventually would reach 100,000 cars, enabling Hungary to
export some to other countries, he added.
   Ministry of International Trade and Industry officials said they
hoped the project would help promote economic relations between
Hungary and Japan.
   The announcement came just before Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
scheduled visit to Budapest next week.
   Some Japanese news reports have said Kaifu, on an 11-day,
seven-nation European tour, would promise up to $1.95 billion of
Japanese assistance to Eastern European countries, including $700
million for Hungary and Poland.
   Suzuki already has a total of 50 minicar and motorcycle plants
abroad, in the United States, Britain, Spain, Canada, South Korea
and 23 other countries.
