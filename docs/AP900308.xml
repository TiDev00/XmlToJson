   A subway car derailment that killed three
people and injured 162 may have been triggered by a dragging motor
that hit a track switch, federal investigators said Thursday.
   The altered switch may have sent the last three cars in the
six-car train onto another set of tracks Wednesday, causing one car
to be yanked into steel support beams, said John K. Lauber of the
National Transportation Safety Board. Evidence indicated the motor
dropped when a nut came loose, Lauber said, adding that
investigators were told that subway motors had dropped from their
supports three times in the last 15 years, most recently just a
month ago.
   ``That probably resulted in the pivoting of the motor under the
car ... and that probably was the initiation of the accident,'' he
said.
   A 37-block section of west Philadelphia's 12.8-mile subway and
elevated train line, a major commuter artery in the nation's
fifth-largest city, remained closed Thursday as federal
investigators made their final inspection of the wreckage.
   Extra buses were pressed into service to handle some of the
100,000 people who typically ride the line twice a day.
   The accident was the worst in the 21 years the commuter system
has been operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority. Many of the cars on the line are 20 years old, but all
six on the train in the accident had been renovated in the last
eight years, SEPTA said.
   All three of the dead were among seven passengers trapped in the
wreckage after three support beams tore into one car, authorities
said. Of the 162 people treated at 10 hospitals, 16 remained
hospitalized Thursday; two were in critical or serious condition.
   The city Medical Examiner's Office identified two of the dead as
Denise Devlin, 34, and Gospodin Kanchev, 52, both of Philadelphia.
The third victim, a 60-year-old woman who died after her leg was
amputated in an effort to free her from the wreckage, remained
unidentified.
   The motor, which was under the third car, hit a crossover switch
about 1,500 feet after coming loose, Lauber said.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that problems with the bolts
breaking led SEPTA employees to brace the motors with bars.
   Harry Knittel, business agent with the Transport Workers Union,
said the car with the suspect motor had been inspected once a month
for at least the past 12 months and the last inspection had been
Feb. 1.
   ``There's only so much welding and repairs that 30-year-old
frames can take,'' he told the News.
   SEPTA has ordered inspections of all older subway cars, which
date from the early 1960s.
   NTSB investigators documented damage to cars and tracks, made
diagrams of seats, examined training, maintenance and operations
records; interviewed survivors and studied blueprints of the cars,
Lauder said.
   ``Our people are underneath the car,'' he said. ``They're
crawling all over the car. They've been crawling underneath and
around the sides and all over. We've also been collecting bits and
pieces from along the entire accident scene.''
   The NTSB gave SEPTA permission to finish clearing the shattered
glass and twisted metal left from the wreck.
   SEPTA put an extra 120 buses into service to deal with the
service shutdown, which also affected underground sections of a
subway-surface streetcar system.
   Subway support columns dating to about 1907 will be repaired if
necessary, SEPTA said, but Lauder said there were no indications
the beams had been damaged.
   The NTSB has no regulatory powers but determines the probable
cause of about 3,000 plane crashes and other transportation
accidents annually. It recommends preventive steps to government
agencies and industry.

<HEAD>Wife of Death Row Inmate Sues to Bear His Child</HEAD>

   The wife of a death row inmate is suing for a
conjugal visit or artificial insemination by her husband so he can
``give back a life'' before his own is taken.
   ``I would like to visit my husband in private so that we can
conceive a child the way God intended,'' Lisa Petrocelli said in a
statement Wednesday after filing suit in federal court.
   ``If I'm not granted my wish to be a real wife to my husband I
want to have his baby by artificial insemination.''
   Tracy Petrocelli, 38, was sentenced to death in 1982 for fatally
shooting a car dealer during a test drive. He also was sentenced to
life in prison for killing a former girlfriend in a Seattle
restaurant in 1981.
   ``My husband is being punished, but that does not make it right
to punish me and my baby,'' said Mrs. Petrocelli, 26. ``We are
running out of time. I want to have this baby and I do not think
God would think it is wrong to bring a new baby into the world.''
   The Nevada prison system has no intention of allowing conjugal
visits, which would require special rooms and supervision, said
prison spokesman Glen Whorton.
   ``We're not planning on developing any kind of artificial
insemination program either,'' he said.
   Carter King, the couple's attorney, called it cruel and unusual
punishment to prevent Petrocelli from fathering a child.
   ``The best thing he can possibly do now is give back a life,''
King said. ``He took a life and this allows him to give one back to
the world.''
   The Petrocellis were married in 1988 at the state prison in
Carson City, 30 miles south of Reno. They began corresponding after
an inmate at a Las Vegas jail where Mrs. Petrocelli worked as a
nurse put them in touch.
   In October they sued the state because prison authorities barred
her from visiting her husband after drug-sniffing dogs zeroed in on
her car trunk and her purse. No drugs were found.
   The lawsuit is pending; Petrocelli has been transferred to the
state's new maximum-security prison in Ely, about 300 miles from
his wife's home in Reno.
   At his trial, Petrocelli said the car dealer was accidentally
killed in an argument over the car's price. Petrocelli has
exhausted his state appeals and his case is before a federal judge.
   Robert Dulin, a paralegal working on the case with King, said he
doesn't believe either of the Petrocellis has any children.
   ``Just because her husband has committed a crime and is on death
row paying for it doesn't mean his would-be children should
suffer,'' Dulin said. ``She just wants to have his baby to carry on
his name.''
   Nevada has 51 men and one woman who face death by lethal
injection. Four men have been executed in Nevada since the Supreme
Court allowed states to resume use of the death penalty in 1976.
   According to the Criminal Justice Institute, as of Jan. 1, 1989,
10 states allowed conjugal visits: California, Connecticut,
Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming.

<HEAD>Hose Rupture Caused Atlantis Pressure Drop, NASA Says</HEAD>

   A ruptured hose spilled five gallons
of hydraulic fluid inside shuttle Atlantis and caused a brief drop
in pressure just before landing, but the astronauts were never in
danger, NASA says.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said Wednesday the damaged hose
will be analyzed to determine what caused the problem.
   Atlantis was returning on Sunday from a secret military mission
to deploy a spy satellite when Mission Control announced an
indicator light was on, warning of a pressure drop in the hydraulic
system that controls flaps and steering.
   A few minutes after the 9:40 a.m. PST announcement, NASA
reported pressure had been restored. The shuttle landed smoothly at
10:08 p.m. Neither of Atlantis' two backup hydraulic systems was
used, the space agency said.
   ``We don't think it was any threat at all based on the
information we had at the descent,'' NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham said.
   Because of a Pentagon-imposed blackout surrounding the 4{-day
mission, the hose may have ruptured before the problem became
public, Malone said. The blackout was lifted 1{ hours before
touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``It wasn't announced until re-entry,'' she said. ``It could
have happened on the mission or on the way up.''
   A thin coating of hydraulic fluid was found throughout the aft
engine compartment, Malone said. Engineers discovered a 1-inch
split in a 3-foot-long high-pressure hose for one of the shuttle's
three auxiliary power units.
   Technicians on Wednesday removed the rubber-coated stainless
steel hose and sent it for analysis to Rockwell International in
Downey, Calif., Malone said. The company builds the orbiters but
contracts out work involving the hoses.
   If the problem had existed and been detected before liftoff,
NASA would have delayed the mission until the hose was repaired or
replaced, Malone said.
   Malone said she was not aware of a hydraulic line rupturing
during any previous mission.
   Removal of the hose will not affect the shuttle's piggyback jet
ride from Edwards back to Kennedy Space Center, Malone said.
   A modified Boeing 747 is scheduled to transport Atlantis on
Saturday. The trip, including stopovers for refueling, is expected
to take about nine hours.

<TEXT>
   In a shabby, ice-cold meeting room behind
a village store deep in the farmlands of southern Poland, 150
people burst into patriotic song _ in German.
   The sound is chilling to Poles with vivid memories of the
brutality of Nazi occupiers and a history of partition by foreign
powers.
   But it is encouraged by the Solidarity-led government, which is
committed to recognizing Poland's ethnic diversity after decades of
repression.
   ``We've been negated for a long time, we didn't exist ... We had
to save ourselves,'' says Jan Krol, founder of the newly registered
German cultural society. He was in his 20s when his native Gogolin
became part of Poland.
   Yet just as Poland's German minority is being acknowledged, the
debate over guaranteeing Poland's western border prior to German
reunification is again stirring tensions between two nationalities
that have often in their histories fought bloody battles over land.
   With the assent of the other World War II allies, Stalin created
postwar Poland's western third from lands seized from the defeated
Nazis, compensation for an even larger swath the Soviets took from
eastern Poland.
   Millions of ethnic German nationals were expelled _ 1.4 million
from the Silesian region that includes Gogolin _ and the acquired
territory was resettled by the Poles uprooted from the east.
   Communist governments in Warsaw refused to acknowledge that
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans still lived in Poland;
their secret police and vigorous discrimination worked to prevent
any manifestation of German identity.
   But under the red-tile roofs of Silesia, German is spoken to
this day. And in some West German political circles, these lands
are still considered German.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's reluctance to unequivocally
renounce claims to Silesia and commit a united Germany to its
current Polish border along the Oder and Neisse rivers has strained
relations with Poland.
   Just five months ago, Kohl made a long-planned conciliatory
visit to Poland, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki assured Kohl
that Poland was committed to helping its German minority maintain
its heritage.
   Four times since 1985, attempts by Krol to register his cultural
society had been rejected. On Feb. 16, it was officially registered.
   Now, the sitting room of his modest house, without a telephone
like most in this tiny hamlet, is a beehive of activities to
organize the estimated 300,000 to 400,000 ethnic German Silesians.
   ``We are facing a difficult task to get back what was taken away
in 1945 _ our culture, or language. We are going to strive for
that, fight for that,'' said the white-haired, raspy-voiced Krol in
an interview frequently interrupted by German-speaking visitors
bringing petitions.
   When Krol's son, Henryk, tried to become the only ethnic German
to gain election to Parliament, there was an outburst of
anti-German nationalism. Grafitti went up saying: ``Germans Go
Home.''
   Henryk lost the February by-election.
   Some Poles are sympathetic to the German minority's desire to
practice its traditions. But many are not, suspecting aspirations
are harbored for parts of Poland to become German again.
   ``We are willing to grant full rights to persons or groups of
authentic German descent who profess their allegiance to German as
their native tongue and to German tradition,'' Solidarity's Jerzy
Wuttke, chairman of Parliament's ethnic minorities commission, told
Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   ``We will make sure, however, that those rights will not be
abused to harm Poland's national interest,'' he said.
   Poles, who lost 6 million people during World War II, say it is
unsettling to see banners proclaiming ``Helmut You Are Our
Chancellor, Too'' greeting Kohl. Some wonder if it is the better
economic situation in Germany that moves some ethnic Germans to
profess such allegiance.
   When mostly older ethnic Germans gathered late one recent
afternoon in Gogolin to organize their ranks, they started by
singing of ``heimat,'' the homeland.
   ``This is `heimat.' It's ours ...,'' said the elder Krol. ``We
were born here. It is our home. Our family is here.''
   The Krols and their neighbors say they hope their efforts will
maintain a German presence in the region.
   ``The younger people are waiting and watching to see what will
happen now, if it will be positive ... They have their suitcases
packed,'' said Hubert Materla, who returned to Gogolin in 1946
after being released from an American prisoner-of-war camp.
   He said the secret police harassed him for speaking German and
that of 16 people who tried to organize an ethnic German group in
the early 1980s, only he remains in Poland.
   For the Krols, Materla and others in the community, German
reunification means the elimination of one border, East Germany's,
now crossed to visit the many, including 70 percent of the Krol
family, who have already left.
   Without expressing desire for change, the Krols stop short of
affirming Poland's current territory.
   ``Very often I am asked like Chancellor Kohl about recognition
of the Oder-Neisse border,'' said the younger Krol. ``The issue is
very simple: the border does exist ... Today it would be difficult
to imagine a similar resettlement of people ... It seems there is
no other way,'' he said.
   Added his father: ``The hopes for any kind of border change are
very small.''
   Instead, they say they seek German teachers for their schools.
   ``There are many young people who speak Polish but have German
hearts,'' said Henryk Krol, a 41-year-old veternarian who considers
his German ``like a 5-year-old's.''
   And they want to win representation in May elections for local
governments _ villages that are 90 percent German dot the region.

   The midday sun seems about to burn
holes in the streets of the capital. The dry-season wind blows dust
against still-bright election slogans, painted in yellow on curbs
and daubed red and blue on the sides of dilapidated buildings.
   The Feb. 25 election spelled the defeat of Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government. If all goes as planned, power will be
transferred next month to a largely conservative opposition
coalition which says it will use free-market tactics to rescue the
country from economic collapse.
   The task will be a mighty one. Each side in the election had its
own view of Nicaragua's future, but they agree about the grimness
of its present: a largely agrarian, potentially prosperous nation
where war, inflation and unemployment have brought many close to
despair.

   Managua used to have a downtown, before the earthquake of 1972.
Those streets now see only a trickle of people, walking past
boarded-up buildings and vacant lots filled with scrub.
   The national cathedral has looked like a medieval ruin since the
quake, its Gothic arches, roofless, soaring into the sky.
   Families live in the downtown now, pigs and chickens wandering
in crude courtyards beside their shacks. Within sight of a
modernistic new convention center, one of downtown's few
attractions, a naked toddler and his raggedly dressed brothers and
sisters play in the street on a 90-degree day.
   Inside a crumbling downtown building that somehow survived the
quake, a Sandinista-organized collective works busily, women
hunched over sewing machines.
   The Sandinistas built collectives throughout the country,
calling them an answer to capitalist exploitation of workers. They
also built schools and health clinics and told workers that they
were finally masters of their country.
   A slogan painted on a cracked outside panel of the sewing
collective's building reads, ``We are free now. We will never be
slaves again.''

   At the gracious home of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Nicaragua's
president-elect, a houseman brings coffee and Coca-Cola for
visitors. The house is nondescript from the street, but inside it
spreads into a handsome mansion, flowing gracefully from interior
rooms into a garden with twisting paths and plants dramatically
backlit at night.
   Sitting in a dark study crammed with memorabilia, her left leg
in a cast from a recent knee operation, the 60-year-old,
silver-haired Mrs. Chamorro says she is certain her UNO coalition
can solve Nicaragua's problems. She promises to abolish the
Sandinista military draft and put the country back to work. But she
is characteristically vague about details; she often says they are
in the hands of her advisers.
   As her visitors leave, one of them asks if, with the bitterly
fought election just over, her biggest troubles _ running the
country _ are really only now beginning.
   Leaning on her crutches, Mrs. Chamorro smiles.
   ``You're such a pessimist,'' she says.

   Raul Solorzano, who runs a plastics plant in Managua and serves
in the local Chamber of Industry, is optimistic. Mrs. Chamorro's
coalition is going to get business running again, he says, and the
country will prosper after near economic ruin under the Sandinistas.
   ``We want the United States to help,'' he says. But if it
doesn't, he says, Nicaragua's private sector will rebuild the
country by itself.
   The accomplishments of the Sandinista revolution, he says, were
few. People received land to live on, but basic services like water
and sanitation never appeared. The Sandinistas never understood
economics, he says, and failed to generate money for improvements
they wanted to make.
   ``One thing is for certain,'' Solorzano says. ``This country is
through with communism. People here will never be communists
again.''

   At the shiny Olof Palme convention center, Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega, in jeans and a dark blue-and-red striped shirt, is
very much defending the accomplishments of the revolution.
   Addressing the Inter American Press Association, he makes no
apology for what the Sandinistas have done in nearly 11 years since
they overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza. Sandinistas say the
revolution would have accomplished even more if the government had
not had to fight a war against the U.S.-backed Contras.
   ``After the 25th of April I shall be in the opposition,'' Ortega
says. ``I shall be in constructive, not destructive, opposition.''
   But he warns that he and the Sandinistas, who will hold the
biggest single bloc of votes in the new National Assembly, are
determined to ``strengthen and carry forward'' what the Sandinistas
have done so far.
   ``Today we are facing a very difficult situation,'' he says.
``And it will depend on the maturity of those who rule, and those
who are ruled, to take the country on the road to development and
peace.''

   A Sandinista mural on a downtown street shows a grotesque Statue
of Liberty, hands transformed into talons, trying to strangle the
Nicaraguan revolution. Helping is a Grim Reaper, clad in an
American flag.
   The Sandinista election campaign hammered home the claim that a
vote for the opposition was a vote for U.S. domination and a return
to the brutal rule of S them back,'' said Dana Neal.
   Some 6,300 bus drivers and 3,000 maintenance and office workers
walked off the job Friday after talks broke down over a new
three-year contract.
   The company has been operating at reduced levels, using about
700 replacement drivers plus union members who crossed picket
lines. The company says about 350 union drivers are at work; the
union says 95 returned.
   ``The cause of this strike is singular,'' union spokesman
Jeffery Nelson said after Wednesday's talks. ``The company has
refused to negotiate with the union that represents its 9,000
employees in good faith.''
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and 10 other senators asked
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to intervene as she did in last
year's Pittston coal strike by appointing a ``supermediator.'' A
spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole said she had no such plans because the
dispute is still under the normal mediation process.
   _ In Redding, Calif., about 500 mourners, half of them striking
drivers in uniform, marched in memory of a driver killed on a
picket line. The mourners were led by the widow of 59-year-old
Robert Waterhouse, who was pinned against a building Saturday by a
bus operated by a replacement driver. No charges were filed.
   _ In Richmond, Va., David W. Batchelor, president of Greyhound's
Eastern division, reiterated the company's position that the
replacement drivers are permanent hires and that strikers who
return will get jobs only as slots become available.
   _ The company obtained its 12th temporary restraining order
prohibiting violence, vandalism and interference with operations.
Several such incidents have occurred since the strike began,
including shots fired at buses in Chicago and windows and mirrors
smashed in other cities.
   Court orders have been granted in Chicago; Cincinnati;
Cleveland; Des Moines, Iowa; Jacksonville, Fla.; Los Angeles; Mount
Laurel, N.J.; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Portland, Ore.; Sacramento,
Calif., and San Francisco.

   Although U.S. aid and Honduran
hospitality toward them have all but run out, Contra rebels are
defiant and even menacing toward their Sandinista archenemies.
   Reluctance to demobilize promptly _ as has been called for by
all five regional presidents and the outgoing and incoming
Nicaraguan administrations _ may jeopardize a peaceful transition
of power in Nicaragua on April 25.
   ``We're not going to put down our guns until the people's will
expressed Feb. 25 is respected. If the Sandinistas try to continue
to run things, it won't only be us fighting them, but the 55
percent of the nation that rejected their totalitarian project,''
said a soldier who uses the pseudonym ``Comandante Wilmer.''
   The 27-year-old veteran of nine years of counterrevolutionary
war was loath to put down his AK-47 assault rifle for even a
moment. He grasped it by the barrel, the wooden stock leaning on a
log, throughout an interview at Contra command headquarters in
Yamales, 85 miles east of Tegucigalpa.
   The sprawling camp of shacks of bamboo, black plastic sheeting
and U.S. government issue ponchos is home to about 10,000 rebels
and 42,000 dependents. Most have spent the better part of the last
two years here, since Washington suspended military aid.
   The army that tried to topple Nicaragua's Sandinista government
was sustained for years by U.S. aid; 30,000 people died in the war
they waged and ended up losing, at least in the field.
   Some non-lethal aid remains in the pipeline. According to Contra
estimates, it is enough to keep them in food, clothing, fuel and
medicine for seven weeks _ or just past Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro's inauguration.
   Wilmer spent several months of last year inside Nicaragua
leading rebel forces despite a cease-fire and the end of military
aid. He said he did not return to Yamales until Feb. 25, the day an
opposition coalition of 14 parties routed the incumbent leftists in
presidential and legislative elections.
   ``We've seen Daniel Ortega's demagogic politics for 10 years, so
it's not enough for us that he says he'll respect the people's
will. Especially when with his other face he's distributing weapons
to provoke civil war in Nicaragua,'' Wilmer said.
   The Sandinistas insist on Contra demobilization and say they
will not transfer control of the army and Interior Ministry
security forces until that happens.
   Contra commanders just as adamantly insist they won't disarm or
demobilize until after all powers are transferred to a new
government. They accuse the leftist regime of intending to retain
power by clinging to military power.
   A statement by Oscar Sovalbarro, chief of a Contra team
discussing demobilization, came only hours after Ortega made a
vehement defense of the Popular Sandinista Army, as the army is
known. Ortega said attempts to reform it _ much less abolish it _
``would unleash a national war.''
   Sovalbarro and Israel Galeano, the top Contra commander, met
this week in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, with Jaime Cuadra,
Mrs. Chamorro's representative.
   Cuadra described the talks as preliminary. Asked about a
specific plan for demobilization and a deadline, he said: ``There
is no plan, and no established deadline.''
   Wilmer said the Contras are still ready to fight if need be.
   ``We're guerrillas,'' said Wilmer. ``Before we were more like a
conventional army. Now our logistical resources are limited. But we
are a nationalist and popular army that arose from the
peasant-farming sector. We have our social and logistical base
inside Nicaragua, and if needs be, we will operate from inside
without outside help.''
   The Contras maintain perhaps 3,000 fighters inside Nicaragua,
and visits to the Nicaraguan countryside before last month's
elections found strong support for the Contras in several provinces.
   ``Our morale is high, especially after Dona Violeta's victory,''
said Contra fighter Noel Lopez, 22, who said he has been fighting
since he was 13. ``The campesino, once he decides on something,
keeps with it until the end.''
   If war resumes, the Contras might stand a fighting chance
against a Sandinista army demoralized by electoral defeat and
weakened by desertions that began only days after the election.
   Even so, doubts remain about the combat readiness and will of
many at Yamales. Most have spent the past two years nearly idle,
with occasional drills. The wives of many are here and many have
had children.
   Whether they could resume a life of extreme privation _ forced
marches, bad food, exposure to inclement weather and mortal danger
_ is uncertain.

<HEAD>Fendi Puts Fur Inside Coats and Out of View of Activists</HEAD>

   The five Fendi sisters have tried to save
their skins, just as animal rights activists threatened to make
them extinct.
   The Fendi claim to fame as the most innovative elegant furriers
on the market was about to put them at the head of the
conservationist's wanted list.
   They are still using fur, but in coats shown Wednesday night it
was used as lining instead of as an outright fashion statement.
   The styles, too, were less elaborate with many down-coats,
parkas and shearlings.
   Karl Lagerfeld, the creative genius behind the Fendi label
indulged in what he termed ``organized confusion,'' dying leather
in bright shades, working it into chamois as soft as silk, or
stuffing it with silk for a down effect.
   He also worked over sheepskin, detailing it with velvet strands,
folk braiding or panels of Tuscan tapestry.
   Meanwhile, inside the coat lurked plush mink or sable, out of
view of animal rights activists who have mounted a campaign to stop
the use of animal skins in garments.
   The opening of a Fendi mega-store on New York's fashionable
Fifth Avenue this past fall risked being a flop when protesters
walked out front shouting anti-fur slogans.
   The campaign could hurt the multimillion-dollar Fendi fashion
empire, which is famous for its furs, but even more renowned for
its leather goods.
   But at the end of Wednesday's show, presented in an elegant
Renaissance palace in downtown Milan, there was much praise for the
move from showy furs to discretion.
   In the past decade Fendi, designed by Lagerfeld, has also become
one of the top labels of Italian ready-to-wear.
   The new fall-winter 1990-91 collection presented during the fur
show was short and sexy with lots of demure coat dresses, cute wool
skating skirts and ribbed wool miniskirts, often worn over thick
wool tights and leg warmers.
   To go under the sportier jackets, Fendi presented skintight
stretch jeans with bright velvet braiding, often coupled with
thigh-high, super-soft suede boots.

   A jury convicted a man of murder and kidnapping
late Wednesday in the shotgun slaying of a preschool teacher, a
case linked to the mail bomb assassinations of a federal judge and
a lawyer.
   Defendant Emmanuel Hammond, 24, of Marietta bowed his head when
the verdict was announced in Fulton County Superior Court, but
otherwise showed no emotion.
   The jury reached its verdict around 11:15 p.m., about eight
hours after deliberations began.
   The prosecution plans to ask for the death penalty. Judge Ralph
Hicks said the trial's sentencing phase would begin Thursday
morning.
   In addition to felony and malice murder and kidnapping, Hammond
was found guilty of armed robbery in the slaying of preschool
fitness teacher Julie Love.
   Miss Love, 27, disappeared in July 1988, and was the subject of
a highly publicized search until her body was found in a northeast
Atlanta dumping ground last August. She had been shot in the head.
   A letter from a group claiming responsibility for the mail bomb
deaths last December of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Robert Vance in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Savannah attorney Robert
Robinson said the attacks were motivated by outrage over Miss
Love's slaying.
   The letter, signed by Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System, threatened more violence if any other white women were
attacked by black men in Alabama, Florida or Georgia. Miss Love was
white; Hammond is black.
   Bombs were also intercepted at the 11th U.S. Circuit courthouse
in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Testimony in Hammond's trial began last week under heavy
security because of concern over the mail-bomb link. A death threat
from a group called the Aryan Resistance Movement, apparently
unrelated to the bombings, prompted even tighter security later.
   In closing arguments Wednesday, Assistant District Attorney
William L. Hawthorne III urged jurors to convict Hammond, saying,
``Give the devil his due.''
   He said there would be more violence if Hammond were acquitted.
   ``As sure as I stand here before you, there will be another
victim,'' Hawthorne said. ``You just don't know her name yet.''
   Defense attorney William A. Wehunt said in his closing statement
that Hammond was innocent.
   Wehunt charged that Hammond's two chief accusers, former
girlfriend Janice Weldon and Hammond cousin Maurice Porter, killed
Miss Love and were trying to frame his client.
   Porter pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape in the
death of Miss Love and is awaiting sentencing.
   He testified last week that Hammond abducted Miss Love from an
Atlanta street after her car ran out of gas and dragged her into
some bushes before shooting her to death.
   Miss Weldon, who led police to Miss Love's body, also testified
against Hammond.

<HEAD>A Princess's Wonderful Day at Coronation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Papa looked very beautiful in his crimson robe,
but there was a terrible draft in Westminster Abbey, wrote the
little princess after her parents' coronation in 1937.
   The childhood essay of Queen Elizabeth II gets its first public
showing beginning Friday in the Queen's Gallery, where royal
treasures are displayed at Buckingham Palace.
   It's part of 271 exhibits called ``A Royal Miscellany'' showing
through Jan. 13, 1991.
   The exhibition includes everything from clocks and jewelry to
the embroidered linen overshirt worn by King Charles I as he knelt
to the headsman's ax in 1649.
   Visitors can view a lock of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's
hair, a watercolor of Balmoral royal estate by Prince Charles, and
a copy of the Mainz Psalter _ a 1457 German collection of prayers
that was the first book printed in more than one color.
   Among the displays are the neat, proper letters of the
11-year-old princess Elizabeth. They are written in a lined
exercise book that would have cost tuppence, four cents at that
time.
   ``I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the Abbey
did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort
of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so,''
wrote the princess.
   Elizabeth, her sister Princess Margaret and their widowed
grandmother Queen Mary had a grandstand view of the ceremony from a
royal box in the abbey, where Elizabeth herself would be crowned in
1953.
   ``What struck me as being rather odd was that Grannie did not
remember much of her own coronation. I should have thought that it
would have stayed in her mind forever,'' Princess Elizabeth wrote.
   However, toward the end, the child found the service becoming
``rather boring'' as it was all prayers.
   ``Grannie and I were looking to see how many more pages to the
end, and we turned one more and then I pointed to the word at the
bottom of the page and it said `Finis.' We both smiled at each
other and turned back to the service,'' she wrote.
   ``The princess was probably asked by her tutor to record her
impressions of the coronation,'' said Oliver Everett, director of
the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the favorite royal residence
21 miles west of London.
   Everett, a former diplomat, selected the essay and 270 other
items for the exhibition.
   ``The library is closed to the public, but the queen takes her
guests there. As the castle is being rewired and repaired, guests
cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some
interesting things to the gallery,'' Everett said in an interview
at Wednesday's preview.
   Even the prophetic thoughts of King George III after the British
defeat by the American colonists in 1781 are displayed: ``America
is lost! Must we fall beneath this blow?'' he wrote.
   But he was consoled by the thought that ``it is to be hoped we
shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we
could derive from them as Colonies.''

   An 11-year-old boy on his way to school was
abducted, beaten and set on fire Wednesday by a man who tried to
force him to smoke crack, authorities and witnesses said.
   The child, whose name was not released, was in critical but
stable condition with second- and third-degree burns over 55
percent of his body at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center's
burn unit, said hospital spokeswoman Myrna Manners.
   ``His injuries are life-threatening,'' Manners said. ``We're
saying he has a 50-50 chance.'' She said the boy was conscious and
talking.
   ``Right now, we don't have a motive,'' said detective Lt.
Charles Monahan. ``We may be dealing with just a psycho.''
   Police believe the boy's attacker was a lone teen-ager who
approached the child as he walked to school in the borough of
Brooklyn and forced him into a small garage between two private
homes.
   Inside the garage, which had been converted into a clubhouse,
the child was tied up and beaten before flammable liquid was poured
on him and he was set on fire, police said.
   Fire Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla said the assault
appeared to have been drug-related, but Monahan said, ``At this
point, we don't have anything to substantiate that.''
   However, The New York Times reported in Thursday editions that
the assailant was a man in his 20s, possibly deranged, who is known
to extort money from children in the area.
   The burning child managed to flee the garage around 10:15 a.m.,
and run to a small auto-body shop about a block away, where workers
called the police and fire departments.
   The boy, whose 12th birthday is Thursday, told the workers his
attacker had tried to force him to smoke crack, the Times said,
attributing the information to police.
   Mechanic Jean Victor, 28, told the Times the boy ``said the guy
started smoking crack and said, `Do you want some?' He said he did
not smoke crack. The guy knocked him down, poured gasoline on him
and burned him.''
   The garage is about six blocks from the boy's home.
   The boy's mother said her son left their apartment around 7 a.m.
to wait for a school bus, as he did every morning.
   The boy's family emigrated from Port-an-Prince, Haiti, a year
ago, and the boy speaks little English, the mother said.

<HEAD>Australian Town Seeks Pied Piper To End Plague</HEAD>

   An Australian beach community is
searching for a Pied Piper to rid it of a plague of rats, who sit
on the beach and grow fat on scraps thrown to them by barbecueing
beachgoers.
   Balsa Park, 80 miles north of Brisbane on the Sunshine Coast
strip of Queensland state, is infested with hundreds of rats up to
a foot long.
   Andrew Champion, an alderman on the Caloundra Town Council, said
Wednesday that the filthy animals usually come out from their
riverside rock residences around dusk but also make appearances at
afternoon cookouts.
   The rats show no fear of humans.
   Champion said that although the rats appear to be friendly,
residents are concerned they may bite children and the council is
search for a way to get rid of the animals. The risk of disease
also is a concern, he said.
   Champion said poisoning cannot be considered because of the
danger it poses to humans and small animals.
   He said he believes trapping the pests in cages is probably the
best option, but the problem is how to attract well-fed rats used
to gourmet offerings from barbecue pits.
   ``This is why we're calling for a Pied Piper who could offer a
solution,'' Champion said.
   Town Clerk John Smith said he believed in an old-fashioned
remedy.
   ``If there are more rats, just get more cats,'' he said.

   Luciano Pavarotti says a diet to reduce his
substantial girth has melted away 80 pounds.
   But when pressed at a news conference Wednesday he refused to
say how much he weighs.
   ``I have lost 80 pounds and so I am 80 pounds less than I was,''
Pavarotti said with a broad smile. Asked how he did it, Pavarotti
replied: ``Very simple. I don't take alcohol, sugar or fat. Just
1,800 calories a day. It's brilliant.''
   To laughter, he said: ``Tonight, I will have a beautiful piece
of salmon with vegetables, a piece of bread, strawberries, mineral
water and lemon and coffee. What do you want more?''
   The 54-year-old Italian tenor was in London for his first
appearance in nearly six years at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden.

   The town where Bruce Springsteen got
his start is losing the museum that documented his rise to fame.
   The Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum will not reopen, its
curators say.
   One of the biggest thrills of Bill Smith's life was the day in
1987 when Springsteen sauntered into the museum that claims the
world's largest publicly displayed collection of Springsteen
memorabilia.
   Within a year, the Palace Arcade that housed the collection of
rare posters and recordings was closed. Now Smith and his partner
have put the items up for sale.
   ``We looked into the possibility of reopening, but we couldn't
find any place to move to,'' Smith said. He said more than 35,000
fans from all 50 states and 18 other countries had visited the
museum since it opened in 1986.

   Singer Freddy Fender doubts the death of
one of his band members is drug-related but says the tragedy
stirred memories of his own previous struggle with drugs and
alcohol.
   Fender, 52, said Wednesday he suffered a deep loss in the death
of bass guitarist Johnny Garcia, who collapsed and died on Sunday.
The cause of death is under investigation.
   ``I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict and it's my
commitment to other drug addicts and other drunks to help them,
because it's going to help me ... If there is any person that is
anti-drugs and anti-booze, it's me,'' Fender said.
   Fender, best known for his country western hit ``Wasted Days and
Wasted Nights,'' saw his career plummet when he drank heavily and
used drugs. Since entering a treatment center in 1985, he has tried
to rebuild his career.
   He knows exactly how long he's been sober: ``Four years, six
months and nine days.''

   Nadia Comaneci's agent says she may
have broken up with Constantin Panait, the married man who
engineered her escape from Romania.
   The Olympic gymnast canceled her first U.S. appearance on the
lecture circuit, apparently because she was upset over the breakup,
said her agent, Bob Davis. She was to have given a speech Wednesday
night at Nassau Community College.
   Davis said he hasn't spoken to Comaneci since she left for Tokyo
more than a week ago with Panait, a roofer with a wife and four
children in Florida. But people in Comaneci's entourage say the two
broke up en route back from Japan, Davis said.
   Comaneci is staying with friends in Montreal, Davis said, where
she won the first perfect 10s in Olympic gymnastics history in
1976. Panait is on the road.
   Comaneci said in a recent magazine interview that she and Panait
had no plans to marry. She said last month that she intends to
marry a 30-year-old fellow Romanian who is expected to enter the
United States later this year.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Would Allow More US-Soviet Air Travel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union are
moving toward a major increase in scheduled and charter air
service, opening for the first time a wide array of destinations in
each nation.
   The development represents one more signal of closer relations
between the two superpowers and opens a potential opportunity for
U.S. commercial air carriers.
   ``Clearly it would appear that the market is going to increase
more rapidly in the future,'' said Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman for
Pan American World Airways, now the only U.S. carrier that flies
into the Soviet Union.
   ``Potentially it's an excellent market,'' she said.
   If the tentative agreement reached in London last week bears
fruit, it would normalize and greatly expand air service disrupted
a decade ago as the United States imposed sanctions to retaliate
against the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the 1981
Soviet-encouraged crackdown against dissidents in Poland.
   Under the preliminary agreement, U.S. airlines would increase
scheduled service to Moscow and Leningrad and gain new rights to
serve six additional Soviet cities, including two in the Soviet Far
East, according to the State Department.
   A department official said Wednesday these cities include Kiev,
the capital of the Ukraine; Riga, the capital of Latvia; Minsk, the
capital of Byelorussia; Tbilsi, the capital of Soviet Georgia; and
Khabarovsk and Magadan in the Soviet Far East. Khabarovsk is a
station on the Trans Siberian Railroad north of Vladivostok.
Magadan is a port on the Sea of Okhotsk, which opens to the Pacific.
   In return, the Soviet airline Aeroflot would be permitted to
increase its trans-Atlantic service to New York and Washington and
would gain new rights to serve Chicago and Miami with onward
service to two undisclosed points in South America.
   Aeroflot service over the Pacific also could begin to Anchorage,
Alaska, and to San Francisco with a stop in Anchorage, the State
Department said.
   Airlines of both nations also could increase the number of
weekly flights and increase the number of airlines designated to
serve the expanded routes, the department said.
   Ms. Hanlon said Pan Am sees the new development as an
opportunity to expand more rapidly in a modest but steadily
increasing market.
   Pan Am, which began non-stop service to Moscow two years ago
with three flights a week, added a flight last year and will
operate five flights a week this summer, Ms. Hanlon said.
   ``We are currently looking to increase that to seven non-stops
next year,'' she said.
   The spokeswoman said Pan Am and other U.S. carriers would not
necessarily open air service to each of the new possible
destinations inside the Soviet Union but would look at each city
``to see if the market is there.''
   The tentative agreement also would allow the United States and
the Soviet Union Soviet up to 100 charter flights a year over the
Atlantic.
   The State Department said ``positive consideration'' also would
be given to trans-Pacific charter flights between the two countries.
   The preliminary agreement was reached by U.S. and Soviet
negotiators at a second round of the London talks. A third round
will be convened in London in late April to discuss financial
provisions and other outstanding issues.
   Then-President Carter ordered Aeroflot to stop its service to
New York after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   In 1981, then-President Reagan cited Soviet-inspired repression
in Poland in ordering Aeroflot to terminate its service to
Washington.
   The latter action halted all Soviet air service to the United
States with the exception of Aeroflot flights carrying diplomatic
personnel and supplies intended for Soviet embassies and consulates.
   In 1983, Reagan ordered Aeroflot's offices in New York and
Washington closed in protest over the shooting down of a South
Korean jetliner by Soviet warplanes.
   Commercial flights between the two nations were resumed in April
1986 with regularly scheduled Aeroflot flights to Washington and
Pan Am flights to Moscow.
   The next year the two nations signed an agreement permitting an
expansion of air service beginning in May 1988.

<HEAD>Witnesses: Hazelwood Appeared Sober Before Boarding Ship</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After losing a bid for dismissal of all
charges against Joseph Hazelwood, the defense called three
witnesses who said he appeared sober hours before his tanker caused
the nation's worst oil spill.
   Among the witnesses was a florist who said she took Hazelwood's
order for Easter flowers to be sent to his home in Huntington,
N.Y., about six hours before the skipper boarded the ship. The
other witnesses were marine terminal guards.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone on Wednesday showed keen
interest in a defense argument on why the Exxon Valdez skipper
should be cleared, but rejected a motion to cut short the trial and
acquit him.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson, in arguing for acquittal, raised a
new legal point: Hazelwood is innocent of operating a vessel while
intoxicated because he was not at the helm when it went aground
March 24.
   ``We realize we are asking this judge to go where no judge has
gone before,'' said Madson. ``In my research, there has never been
a case where a person who is intoxicated has been convicted because
he has the authority to control a vehicle but is not actually at
the controls.''
   He noted that Hazelwood turned over the ship to a third mate
about 10 minutes before it went off course, struck Bligh Reef and
dumped nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude in scenic Prince
William Sound. The oil devastated hundreds of miles of rocky shore
and killed countless birds, fish and other wildlife.
   The defense steadfastly maintains the skipper was sober when the
ship went aground. But Madson drew the analogy of a person who is
intoxicated, gets in a cab and tells the driver where to go. If the
driver runs a red light and hits a school bus, the person in the
back seat giving directions is not at fault.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said Coast Guard
regulations clearly require the captain to be sober, no matter
where he is on the ship.
   The judge countered that Coast Guard regulations do not apply
because Hazelwood is on trial under state, not federal, law.
   But he refused to drop the intoxication charge or the other
charges, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and negligent
discharge of oil.
   Hazelwood, 43, could get up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines if convicted on all counts.
   The legal arguments took place outside the jury's presence.
   Following the judge's ruling, Madson called to the stand Emily
Kaiser, a Valdez flower shop owner who said she took Hazelwood's
order.
   ``He was sober,'' she declared, saying she remembered him
because she also is from Huntington and they chatted about their
hometown, which is on Long Island.
   ``Were you pretty busy that day?'' Cole asked on
cross-examination.
   ``Yes,'' said the witness, ``but not that busy that I don't
remember Mr. Hazelwood because of the Long Island deal.''
   Two other witnesses were guards at the Aleyeska terminal who
screen seamen for contraband and signs of intoxication before they
board their ships. Charles Dudley and Michael Craig remembered
Hazelwood arriving by cab with two other crew members and said they
noticed no signs that Hazelwood was drunk.
   The prosecution rested Wednesday after calling 45 witnesses in
4{ weeks.

<TEXT>
   Former Michigan congressman Charles Diggs Jr.,
who resigned 10 years ago after being convicted of accepting
payroll kickbacks, says he'll run for a seat in the Maryland House
of Delegates.
   Diggs, a Democrat, said Wednesday he would serve just one term
and has no interest in running for Congress again.
   ``My principal reason for running is to be in Annapolis during
the reapportionment consideration in 1991 and '92,'' said Diggs,
explaining that he wants to tap the political potential of blacks
in the state.
   States redraw political boundary lines, including congressional
and legislative districts, after the national census every 10
years. That process would begin in 1991 based on population counts
from the 1990 census.
   Although Maryland is not likely to pick up an additional
congressional seat, ``there's going to be significant realignment
in drawing new lines,'' the former Detroit representative said in a
telephone interview.
   He said there is increased discussion about changing the
boundaries of Maryland's suburban 5th Congressional District, now
represented by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer, ``to
create a district that would be ripe for a black candidate.''
   Diggs, a licensed mortician, served in Congress for 25 years
before resigning in 1980 after he was convicted of mail fraud and
falsifying staff payroll vouchers.
   He founded the Congressional Black Caucus, chaired the House
Committee on the District of Columbia and also headed the Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa.
   Diggs said he sees the importance of protecting Hoyer, who is
fourth in the House leadership hierarchy, but said ``progress
toward power-sharing among white controlling interests in the state
and (Prince George's) county is moving too slowly.''
   Hoyer said the scenario for redistricting outlined by Diggs is
one of several being discussed.
   ``I think any area that experiences growth in an ethnic or
minority group needs to accommodate that,'' said Hoyer, but
``political realities'' will make it difficult to expand the
Maryland congressional delegation while protecting incumbents.
   Diggs, 67, said he has no interest in a congressional seat that
might come out of redistricting.
   ``I'm interested in the development of the talents of younger
people to take over various offices'' that will become available as
the county and state black population grows, he said.
   Diggs said he will file candidacy forms next month for the
Maryland House from a legislative district in Prince George's
County.

<HEAD>Committee Approves First Gene-Transfer Therapy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first human gene-transfer therapy could
begin within a year if other government panels join a National
Institutes of Health committee in approving the experimental
treatment to combat a rare immune deficiency in children.
   Six other federal committees must concur with Wednesday's
decision by the NIH Institutional Biosafety Committee before the
experimental therapy can be tried.
   The treatment would be the first time that a human illness had
been directly treated by the process of gene transfer. The process
would insert curative genes into the blood cells of children
suffering adenosine deaminase deficiency.
   If approved, clinical use could begin by late fall or winter.
   The proposal was presented by Dr. W. French Anderson of the
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, one of the National Institutes of
Health, and Dr. Michael Blaese of the National Cancer Institute.
   Blaese said the clinical plan is to remove lymphocytes _ white
cells _ of the blood of children with the immune deficiency and
insert into them the gene they lack.
   Lymphocytes are the major infection-fighting element of the
immune system.
   The treated cells then would be cultured until they increase in
number by about a thousandfold, and then transferred back into the
patient's bloodstream.
   Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that performs an essential
function in the immune system. Without the enzyme, the body's
ability to fight infection is crippled.
   The gene that would be inserted would program the cells to
produce the missing enzyme.
   The therapy would not be a permanent cure, Blaese said, since
the enzyme would be produced only as long as the genetically
manipulated cells live.
   ``We don't know how long these cells last,'' he said. ``Some
lymphocytes, however, can live for years.''
   The researcher said the therapy might allow patients to live
longer than they would otherwise. However, scientists hope to
develop a system where the gene could be placed in the cells of the
bone marrow, which would permanently correct the enzyme deficiency.
   Adenosine deaminase deficiency is ``very, very rare,'' said
Blaese. ``There are only 20 to 30 patients in the whole world.''
   The sufferers are born without the required gene. Some are
treated successfully by bone marrow transplants, but for many the
disorder means death within the first year or two of life by some
infectious disease.

   Poor people who live and work in rural areas
would benefit more than city dwellers from several proposed
anti-poverty programs, according to a report released today.
   The study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes
that a disproportionate share of working poor live in rural areas.
Although only 23 percent of the nation is rural, 33 percent of the
working poor live in rural areas, it said.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., whose state's poverty rate increased
from 13.4 percent in the early 1980s to 15.5 percent by the middle
of the decade, said some of the center's recommendations would cost
more than the country can afford now.
   ``However, there are smaller steps we can take, and have taken,
to begin to meet the needs of the rural working poor,'' said Synar,
who released the study along with Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.
   The report suggested aiding the working poor by:
   _Enlarging the earned income tax credit for low-income families
with children.
   _Extending the child care tax credit to low-income working
families.
   _Restoring the minimum wage to its average purchasing power
during the 1960s and 1970s.
   _Partially reversing cutbacks made during the 1980s in the
unemployment insurance program.
   _Expanding Medicaid so it can provide health care coverage to
more children in working poor families.
   The earned income tax credit _ available to low- and
moderate-income families with children _ offers an example of how
rural working poor benefit more from such programs than those in
the city.
   To receive the credit, which was worth up to $910 in 1989,
families need only to file a federal income tax return. The family
either gets a tax break, or if the family's income is too low to be
taxed, the government sends a check for the appropriate amount.
   ``Since wages are lower in rural than in urban areas, and since
a larger proportion of the rural poor work, the proportion of
families qualifying for the (tax credit) is higher in rural than in
urban locations,'' said the center.
   Legislation to increase the amount of money available under the
earned income tax credit is pending in the House.
   If the minimum wage were increased to give it the same
purchasing power it had 20 or 30 years ago, a larger share of rural
workers would benefit than city dwellers, said the report, because
one in three rural workers earn at or near the minimum wage,
compared with about one in five urban workers.
   ``Expansion of the earned income credit, combined with full
restoration of the minimum wage, would lift a substantial number of
rural working poor households out of poverty,'' said Robert
Greenstein, center director and coauthor of the report.
   Providing extended unemployment benefits in areas of states with
very high unemployment _ even if the state as a whole doesn't
qualify _ would help rural areas where unemployment is often
seasonal, he said.
   Currently, extended benefits may be provided to the long-term
unemployed only when the statewide jobless rate is very high.
   The report is one in a series of rural poverty reports by the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent research
organization that specializes in the analysis of data and policy
issues affecting low- and moderate-income Americans.

<HEAD>Production Keeps Falling Under Drastic Economic Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production in state industries has fallen
by nearly a quarter since the Solidarity-led government began its
shock transformation of the economy from central planning to
capitalism, statistics show.
   Since the plan took effect Jan. 1, industrial managers have
started exporting some goods because of slack domestic demand, the
official PAP news agency said Wednesday in a report based on
government figures.
   Tens of thousands of Poles have lost their jobs and others can
afford few things to buy because price rises have outstripped wage
increases during the first two months of the plan.
   The government lifted price controls and subsidies, which caused
prices to rise to market levels, and restricted wage increase as
part of the plan to fight hyperinflation and restructure the
economy by forcing inefficient enterprises to close.
   But the figures from the Main Statistical Office showed not a
single state enterprise had gone bankrupt despite the drop in
production, the news agency reported.
   In February, state industries reported a drop in production of
23.9 percent compared to December 1989 with the sharpest decline in
food and light industries, PAP said.
   It said wages in Febuary had increased 15 percent from January,
when the average monthly pay in major industries was $65.
   Industrial prices were up 7 percent, while the statistical
office predicted once the final tabulations were made that the
inflation rate for February would not exceed 23 percent.
   Prices in January were estimated to be 60-70 percent higher than
in December, while the inflation rate for 1989 was put at about 700
percent.
   The Finance Ministry announced on Wednesday that it expected the
inlation rate for March to be about 6 percent, PAP said.
   The PAP report gave no figures for unemployment, but the agency
earlier this month reported that as of Feb. 28 there were 152,190
jobless in Poland with only 20,500 openings for jobs.
   Nearly 56,000 people registered as unemployed in January. The
government initially forecast about 400,000 unemployed as
inefficient firms close down and others cut back on the number of
employees.
   The economic program, developed by Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, has the support of many Western governments, the Paris
Club of creditor nations, the World Bank and officials of the
European Economic Community.
   Balcerowicz has anticipated the mass layoffs and prices increase
but stressed the economic pain was temporary and needed to halt the
inflation and to end Poland's economic decline under more than four
decades of Communist rule.
   In August, Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became prime
minister, the first non-Communist head of a government in Eastern
Europe. Since then, democratic reforms have swept the East bloc.

<HEAD>Farmer Mac Preparing to Make Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp.,
called Farmer Mac for short, is tuning up for its grand entry in
the financial market later this year.
   Farmer Mac was created a little more than two years ago by the
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 as a secondary market for
agricultural real estate loans.
   But it has taken time to organize, to work out the kinks and
follow the instructions Congress laid down, Farmer Mac officials
said Wednesday.
   Start-up procedures included the initial sale of $20 million in
voting common stock to banks and other lenders. Rules and operating
specifications are still being honed.
   John R. Dahl, chairman of the board, said after the
corporation's second annual stockholders' meeting that underwriting
standards and other guides must be developed meticulously to ensure
integrity.
   Dahl said Farmer Mac has a ``very strong foundation'' and that
all the deadlines specified by Congress have been met.
   The aim of Farmer Mac, he said, is to ``accomplish the goal that
Congress set out for us ... to increase the availability of
capital, to allow agricultural borrowers and rural housing
borrowers an opportunity of more places to go to look for credit.''
   Hopefully, Dahl added, these borrowers also ``will have the
benefits of competition and competitive interest rates.''
   But Dahl and Henry D. Edelman, the corporation's president and
chief executive officer, could not offer a firm timetable or
identify those in line for actual ``pooling'' operations.
   Banks and other lenders can convert long-term assets _ in this
case real estate mortgages _ by selling the loans on the secondary
market. At that point, those who buy the mortgages package or pool
the loans and then sell loan-backed securities to the public.
   Meanwhile, the original lenders are able to increase their cash
and are able to make more loans to agricultural borrowers.
   Farmer Mac will share the risk of the farm real estate loan
business by guaranteeing returns on the securities.
   Other federal agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. (Freddie Mac), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae) and Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)
serve a similar function for their clientele.
   Dahl, a rancher from Gackle, N.D., said in an interview after
the meeting that ``we've come a long way'' in getting Farmer Mac on
solid ground. But he said there is no way to estimate the
corporation's eventual impact on the nation's agricultural credit
market.
   ``There's no history involved here,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of enthusiasm for Farmer Mac, and I wish I could tell you that
we're going to do a billion dollars in business, or something. But
there's no way we can predict this.''
   But what can be predicted, Dahl added, is that ``we're going to
do everything we possibly can to come up with the kind of program
that Congress envisioned agriculture needed.''
   There has been some concern among other financial authorities
that demand for Farmer Mac's secondary market services might fall
short of expectations.
   Dahl said he wasn't aware of any major threat to Farmer Mac, at
least not in the formative stage.
   ``There are some that are hesitant about Farmer Mac,'' he said.
``And there have been some things in the (news) media from time to
time. But I think those are based on perceptions more than fact ...
nothing's 100 percent, I'd be the first to say that.''
   Also, Dahl said there has been ``some impatience'' about Farmer
Mac not being in business yet.
   ``But we need this program developed with quality and with
integrity,'' he said. ``We're here for the long pull.''
   Dahl said he tried to look back a few years when so much of the
nation's agriculture was going through the financial wringer, and
what Farmer Mac might have done to help.
   ``And I think it would have been a lot easier, a lot more stable
if we had had it,'' he said. ``That's what we need to try and do in
the future.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seeking Special Envoy to Coordinate Hostage Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are urging the Bush
administration to appoint a special envoy of ``prominence and
stature'' to coordinate discussions about the American hostages in
Lebanon.
   ``All signals suggest that an opportunity for release exists,''
Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., told a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee Wednesday _ amid a flurry of news reports suggesting
movement in the hostage situation.
   Slaughter said she and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
first proposed an envoy to tackle the hostage question two years
ago.
   ``Since that time, Congress has recognized National Hostage
Awareness Day and I have commemorated Terry Anderson's five
birthdays in captivity,'' Slaughter said. ``How long do we wait?
Will we again gather in October with heavy hearts to mark another
of Terry's birthdays?''
   Anderson, chief correspondent for The Associated Press in the
Middle East, is the longest held of the eight American hostages in
Lebanon. He will mark five years in captivity on March 16.
Slaughter's district includes his hometown of Batavia, N.Y.
   Most, if not all, of the hostages are thought to be held by
Shiite Moslem groups with ties to Iran. In all, 18 Westerners are
held in Lebanon.
   The subcommittee sent a resolution by Slaughter seeking a
special envoy to the full Foreign Affairs Committee. Moynihan is
seeking a companion resolution in the Senate. If passed, the
resolution would not be sent to President Bush or have the force of
law, but would express Congress' sentiments.
   Slaughter's measure calls on the president to appoint ``someone
of prominence and stature, with a keen understanding of Middle East
politics, to initiate and coordinate discussions between the
Syrians, Iran and other influential parties.''
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, wondered if a special envoy might
conflict whatever the administration is doing secretly on behalf of
the hostages.
   Slaughter said she wouldn't proceed with the measure ``if I have
any reason to believe that this would hurt ongoing efforts.''
   U.S. officials usually oppose the idea of special envoys, said a
State Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Remember Terry Waite _ he was a special envoy,'' this official
said, referring to the Anglican churchman who was seized in Beirut
while trying to free the hostages.
   Mike Kraft, an official in the State Department's
counter-terrorism office, said ``a great deal is being done that is
not publicized'' and that the administration has an ``open-door''
policy in talking to people.
   Officials have insisted however that the U.S. government is not
negotiating with Iran for the release of the hostages.
   U.S. policy is not to deal directly with the Iranians. ``There
are no U.S. government talks,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret D. Tutwiler said.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said administration
officials were ``encouraged by the comments'' of Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who said there might be a solution soon.
   ``They certainly are more hopeful than what we've heard in the
more distant past,'' he said of Rafsanjani's remarks.
   But the Revolutionary Justice Organization said it had no
intention of releasing the hostages it claims to hold, Joseph
Cicippio of Valley Forge, Pa., and Edward Austin Tracy, an American
author.
   A statement by the group, delivered to Beirut newspaper An-Nahar
and a Western news agency, was accompanied by a black-and-white
instant photograph of Cicippio.

<HEAD>Amid Rising Unrest, Avril Says He Might Resign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Under the pressure of mounting
anti-government unrest, Haiti's military leader has indicated he
would consider resigning but also says his departure ``would create
a lot of turmoil.''
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril spoke Wednesday as thousands of students
rallied in provincial cities for the second straight day to protest
the army's killing of an 11-year-old girl.
   The girl was to be buried today and student groups called for a
national day of mourning. Eleven political parties urged businesses
and factories to close in sympathy.
   Asked in a rare interview whether he might resign, Avril said:
``I will never resist the will of the people.'' But, he added, ``We
must get on with elections because elections reflect the will of
the people.''
   ``If I step down hurriedly, it will create a lot of turmoil,''
Avril said at the Presidential Palace. ``I have thought a lot about
how to prevent the country falling into revolution and chaos.''
   On Wednesday, thousands of students marched in the provincial
towns of Jacmel, Jeremie, Leogane, Petit Goave and Mirebalais, the
Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil reported.
   In Gonaives, 100 miles north of the capital Port-au-Prince,
schools stayed closed for a second day, and students set up flaming
tire barricades.
   Schools were also closed in the northern coastal city of
Cap-Haitien, Radio Soleil said.
   The student marches were reminiscent of demonstrations in
November 1985 to protest the army's killing of three high school
students in Gonaives. Those protests led to the downfall of former
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to exile in France in
February 1986.
   Avril, a former Duvalier aide, came to power in September 1988,
replacing Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a coup led by lower-ranking
soldiers.
   He promised elections and reforms but shipped seven
pro-democracy leaders into exile during a crackdown in January and
arrested more than 50 opposition activists, some of whom were
beaten in custody.
   Avril, who has promised presidential elections later this year,
said he imposed a state of siege Jan. 20 as a ``preventive
measure'' after the killing of an army colonel because ``the
electoral process itself was threatened.''
   He lifted the emergency nine days later after an international
outcry.
   On Wednesday, the U.N. Human Rights Commission agreed to begin a
special investigation into allegations of abuses in Haiti, saying
the situation under Avril ``remains disturbing and even seems to
have deteriorated.''
   The Geneva-based organization said it was ``alarmed by the
proliferation of acts of violence in Haiti, particularly against
arrested or detained persons, and by the apparent inability of the
judicial system to put an end to such acts.''
   Virtually all political parties and unions have vowed to boycott
any elections under Avril. They say he can't be trusted to turn
over power to elected civilians.
   Eighteen parties have proposed that Avril be replaced by a
Supreme Court justice until a new leader is elected.
   ``If there is a change of government, that will only delay
elections even more,'' Avril said.
   In the interview, Avril repeated his promise to allow elections
this year and abide by the results. Avril repeated he was not
interested in running for office.
   County and municipal elections are scheduled for April 29,
legislative elections July 22, and presidential elections Oct. 28.
   In November 1987, the first free general elections since
independence from France in 1804 were canceled after attackers
protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters.
   This week's student marches began Tuesday to protest the death
of 11-year-old Roseline Vaval. She was studying on her porch when
she was fatally shot Monday by a soldier breaking up a small
anti-government demonstration in Petit Goave.

<HEAD>Dates For Shevardnadze, NATO Meetings Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
will hold his next round of talks with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Washington April 4-6, U.S. officials say.
   An official announcement is expected by the end of the week.
   The session is designed primarily to prepare for the summit
meeting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will hold here with
President Bush in the second half of June.
   The precise date for the summit has not been set.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said
Wednesday the meeting might be moved up to earlier in June to
accommodate the Soviets, who are expected to hold a major Communist
Party session in late June.
   ``We're always willing to change,'' Fitzwater said. ``We can do
it any time.''
   Baker went to Moscow last month to see Gorbachev and
Shevardnadze. The trip produced a narrowing of differences on a
strategic arms reduction treaty the two leaders would like to sign
at the summit.
   And, the two sides moved closer on provisions for agreements
also being negotiated with other nations to ban chemical weapons
production and to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms
in Europe.
   Baker is making arrangements for a meeting with the 15 NATO
foreign ministers, probably in Brussels, after the Shevardnadze
visit, the officials said.
   This is in addition to a meeting Baker will hold with the NATO
ministers in Ayreshire, Scotland, June 7-9. The session, which has
not been announced, was disclosed by the officials on condition of
anonymity.
   Baker has held five rounds of talks with Shevardnadze so far _
in Vienna last March, in Moscow in May, in Paris in July, in
Jackson, Wyo., in September, and in Moscow Feb. 7-10. They also
could meet in Namibia while attending ceremonies marking the new
African country's independence from South African rule Feb. 21.
   The active schedule reflects both a step-up in talks with the
Soviet Union to try to hasten arms control agreements while lending
U.S. support to political and economic reform and increased
consultation with the NATO allies on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Also, Baker has pledged to consult regularly with the West
Europeans about German unification. The U.S. formula gives special
roles to Britain and France, as well as the Soviet Union, as the
Big Four allies of World War II.
   A number of smaller countries feel left out. Many are victims of
German aggression in World War II and some are worried about the
situation in Europe after West Germany merges with East Germany.
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti carried these concerns
to President Bush and Baker on Tuesday. It then was decided to have
Baker meet with the foreign ministers after Shevardnadze's visit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's choice as the Justice
Department's civil rights chief is headed for likely confirmation
after parrying thrusts by Democratic senators.
   John R. Dunne, a former New York state senator, was peppered
with questions Wednesday by members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee over his lack of civil rights experience, his former
memberships in men-only clubs and investments in companies that do
business in South Africa.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was ``having great
difficulty'' supporting Dunne's nomination to be assistant attorney
general for civil rights.
   Nevertheless, Metzenbaum said, ``I'm not sure President Bush
would appoint anybody better than you. Regardless of how I vote,
you're going to be confirmed.''
   A staff aide said the committee would probably vote on the
nomination March 22.
   At one point, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who chaired the hearing,
asked Dunne if he was ``offended'' by a number of recent Supreme
Court cases that make it tougher for individuals to prove racial or
sexual discrimination.
   ``It triggered my concern,'' Dunne said.
   ``Ideally, I would like to have that nominee sitting there say,
`I was offended,''' Simon said.
   ``Taking those 11 or 12 decisions, I'm alarmed. I'm not offended
yet,'' Dunne replied.
   ``OK,'' Simon said, ``You're getting a little stronger.''
   Metzenbaum also pressed Dunne about his long memberships in the
men-only Garden City (N.Y.) Golf Club on Long Island, N.Y., and the
Fort Orange Club in Albany, N.Y., which began admitting women in
1988.
   Asked whether he ``might have taken a different course of
conduct,'' Dunne replied, ``I believe I would have.''
   Dunne, 60, was tapped for the civil rights job in January. The
post has been vacant since December 1988 when William Bradford
Reynolds resigned.
   Bush's first nominee for the job, William C. Lucas, then a
Michigan county executive, was rejected by the committee by a 7-7
vote last August. Lucas, who is black, had spent most of his career
in law enforcement and had little litigation experience. He was
also opposed by many civil rights organizations.
   Dunne, who resigned from the New York Senate last year after
losing a race for majority leader, has been criticized by civil
rights groups for lacking civil rights experience. None opposed his
nomination outright, however.
   Simon asked Dunne to explain his position on apartheid in light
of the fact that he and his law firm hold stock in companies that
do business in South Africa and that he voted against a measure
requiring New York state to divest such holdings.
   ``Let me put right up in the front: I hate, if one can hate, the
principle of apartheid,'' Dunne replied. ``The three items ... are
unconnected and not indicative of an attitude that favors that
system.''
   Dunne said he cast the vote against divestiture as part of his
responsibility to lead debate on the state Senate floor. ``On a
personal note, I found it very difficult,'' he added.
   As for his own investments, Dunne said his brother is his
stockbroker and ``I have no standard with regard to investments.''
   Simon said it ``would be a very wise thing to do'' if he now
told his brother not to invest in companies that do business in
South Africa.

<HEAD>Bank Profits Drop 34 Percent; Sagging Real Estate Market at Fault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Real estate problems in the Northeast are
dragging down bank profits and some analysts worry the weakness
will spread.
   Banks earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $16.3
billion for all of 1989, a 34 percent drop from $24.8 billion in
1988, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Wednesday.
   Provisions for loan losses hit a near-record $30.3 billion last
year. The FDIC attributed about two-thirds of that to domestic
loans, primarily for real estate development. Third World loan
problems caused the rest.
   Five of the country's 10 largest banks were in the red last
year, primarily because of provisions for losses on developing
country loans. They were Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty,
Manufacturers Hanover, Bankers Trust and Chemical Bank.
   Bad real estate loans more than doubled in the Northeast, where
four states _ Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and New
York _ were among the 10 with the highest percentage of sour real
estate loans.
   The Boston-based Bank of New England alone lost $1.1 billion
last year, most of it in real estate.
   Problem real estate continued to cause losses in the Southwest,
but institutions in that region appear to be recovering somewhat.
Texas' losses, for instance, totaled $537 million last year, down
from $2.1 billion in 1988.
   Despite the downturn, banks outside the Southwest poured money
into real estate loans, particularly in the as-yet-untroubled
Southeast and West. Real estate lending increased 12.8 percent
nationally, compared with a 5.4 percent growth rate for bank assets
generally.
   The chairman of the FDIC, L. William Seidman, called attention
to the real estate figures but declined to predict if the situation
would deepen or spread this year. Private analysts were less
reticent.
   ``We are in a particularly vicious real estate cycle,'' said
economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates of West
Chester, Pa. ``I think you're going to get more bad news ...
particularly in the Southeast in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas
because there was a lot of speculative buying there.''
   ``I think you'll see continued problems in the Northeast and on
a selected basis in the Southeast,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, an
Austin, Texas-based analyst. ``The big question mark is California.
How long can they continue to maintain high prices for real
estate?''
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Office of Thrift
Supervision said net withdrawals from savings institutions totaled
$8.6 billion in December, bringing outflows for all of 1989 to a
record $73.6 billion.
   December marked the 18th outflow in 19 months and was the
biggest drain since September, when withdrawals excluding interest
credited totaled $8.8 billion.
   Outflows for the year were the largest on record. The last big
outflow, $25.4 billion, occurred in 1981 when interest rates at
competing money-market mutual funds skyrocketed at a time when
thrift rates were capped by law.
   ``What you're seeing now is unprecedented ... but it's not
surprising,'' said economist Martin Regalia of the National Council
of Savings Institutions.
   Early in the year the industry lost deposits, in part, because
S&amp;L problems had shaken customers' confidence. But, economists say
the shrinkage in the last half of the year is almost entirely a
response to tough new financial standards in President Bush's S&amp;L
bailout, enacted last August.
   The rules require thrifts to back their lending with more of
their owners' money. Most can't raise the capital. As a result,
they must trim their balance sheets.
   Thrifts shed $25.6 billion in assets in December, with $4.6
billion of that coming at S&amp;Ls under government control and almost
three-fourths of the remainder at weakly capitalized thrifts still
operating independently.
   S&amp;L assets at the end of the year totaled $1.25 trillion, down
$100 billion, 7.3 percent, from a year earlier. In contrast,
commercial bank assets grew 5.4 percent to $3.3 trillion.
   ``I think the (S&amp;L) downsizing is going to continue throughout
1990 and maybe into 1991 as well, although we might see some ebbing
of the pace,'' Regalia said.

<HEAD>Lufthansa Signs Letter to Buy East German Interflug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West Germany airline
Lufthansa has tentatively agreed to buy a 26 percent share of
Interflug, East Germany's state-owned carrier, a Lufthansa
spokesman said.
   The agreement is similar to those signed by many West German
companies who want to acquire partners over the border since East
Germany ousted its hard-line Communist leaders in October.
   The two airlines reached a preliminary agreement earlier this
week, but details are still being worked out, the Lufthansa
spokesman said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Lufthansa has signed a letter of intent to make the
purchase, but did not say how much it would pay.
   The spokesman said closer links with Interflug does not mean a
merger is planned with the wealthy West German carrier, which is 51
percent controlled by the state. The letter of intent specifically
allows Interflug to develop new routes on its own and the East
German company's employees will be guaranteed their jobs, he said.
   East Germany's Communist-led interim government has been moving
to open up its economy and make it more compatible with its
powerful capitalist neighbor's, but a full foreign investment code
has not been fixed.
   The airlines have been negotiating closer cooperation since last
fall. They already have agreed to work together in several areas
including booking systems, pilot training, airline catering and
charter flights.
   A spokeswoman at the East German Transport Ministry said this
week that no final accords can be signed with Lufthansa until
Interflug workers vote next week on whether they want cooperation
with the Western airline.
   News reports have suggested Interflug might lease 17 Boeings
737-200s from Lufthansa in 1992 as the West German carrier phases
in newer planes.
   Although strapped for capital, the East German company has also
expressed interest in buying jets from Airbus Industrie S.A., a
European consortium, to replace its aging Soviet-built fleet.

<TEXT>
   The 20-year fight over the Seabrook, N.H.,
nuclear plant is entering what may be its final chapter as
opponents look to federal appeals court in Washington prevent the
plant from generating commercial power.
   An appeal filed Wednesday by two anti-nuclear groups and the
Massachusetts attorney general seeks to highlight the public risk
posed by the plant and the alleged procedural slight-of-hand used
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in granting Seabrook a
full-power license.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon and the groups
argued in their U.S. Court of Appeals filing that thousands of
residents and beachgoers near New Hampshire plant would be unable
to escape in a nuclear emergency.
   They also contended that the NRC improperly ignored that very
conclusion made by a lower-level board within the agency.
   ``This large, close-in `beach population' has access to very
limited shelter and estimates of the evacuation times for these
populations (seven to 11 hours) greatly exceed the arrival times of
a radioactive plume,'' the opponents said in a 20-page motion.
``The many thousands of beachgoers face entrapment.''
   The appeal includes the request for a stay and a motion for the
court to revoke the license and send the issue back to the NRC for
further consideration.
   Joining Shannon in the lawsuit were the New England Coalition on
Nuclear Power and the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League.
   ``The commission has violated the intent of Congress and its own
regulations by finding this is an adequate evacuation plan,'' said
attorney Robert Backus, representing the league.
   ``We are happy to be in court,'' Shannon said in an interview.
``This is the opportunity we have been looking for. We have been
precluded from making these arguments before.''
   Plant officials predicted Wednesday that the appeals will fail.
   ``We don't believe that there would be any reason to further
delay the operation of Seabrook,'' said plant spokesman Ron Sher.
   The NRC had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. ``We'll have to
file our own reply. When that will happen, I don't know,'' said
commission spokesman John Kopeck.
   The NRC voted 3-0 last Thursday to grant Seabrook its full-power
license. The $6.5 billion plant has been tested at low power but
has not been allowed to operate at full throttle. The NRC placed a
hold on the license for up to 14 days to allow time for appeals.

<HEAD>Marauding Mollusks Threaten to Turn Great Lakes Into Mussel
Beaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small, striped aliens that stowed away on
European freighters are threatening the security of North America's
waterways, warn lawmakers who fear the Great Lakes will become
mussel beaches.
   The rapid spread of the marauding mollusks led legislators
Wednesday to introduce bills aimed at preventing further aquatic
invasions and battling the one underway by the dread zebra mussel.
   Unchecked, the exotic, inedible shellfish could cause $5 billion
in damage by the turn of the century and spread to two-thirds of
the nation's waterways, said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' said Glenn, who was joined at a
news conference by seven lawmakers who want the federal government
to spend $40 million to research and control the barnacle-like
creature.
   ``We don't want to look a few years from now on what we should
have spent this year,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., whose
district is bound by Lake Michigan. That lake so far is mussel-free
except for the bottom of one boat in Green Bay, Wis.
   The mussels, usually no more than 1{ inches long, are believed
to have been carried here from Eastern Europe three years ago in
the ballast water of freighters.
   They've multiplied dramatically because they spawn almost
continuously _ an adult female can produce upwards of 30,000 eggs
in a year _ and because there has been nothing to control the
spread of the alien mussels.
   An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional
Research Service found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat
zebra mussels but warned that there may not be enough intact
wetlands to provide a habitat for more of the natural predators.
   There weren't enough predators to prevent 30 tons of mussels
from clogging a 2{-mile intake pipe at an Ontario water plant or
prevent mussels from accumulating up to two inches thick on screens
of the water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co.
power plants.
   Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for three
days after zebra mussels restricted water flow. Detroit Edison Co.
had to reduce the output of its Monroe, Mich. plant by 25 percent
because one of its pipes became coated with the mussels.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said a $29 million breakwall that
took a decade to get for Presque Isle in Lake Erie is being
jeopardized by zebra mussels.
   And Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., warned that the shellfish can easily
migrate into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems,
which ``could become literally mussel-bound.''
   And there's more. Dead zebra mussels can produce ``offensive
quantities of methane gas,'' according to the congressional
research report. When they die in the pipes of water treatment
systems they can give the water a foul taste and smell. Once they
wash ashore, the mussels' sharp shells can rip up the bare feet of
beach walkers.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the mussels already endanger
the fisheries of Lake Erie by stripping the lake of microscopic
feeder plants.
   When the bottom of the aquatic food chain collapses, ``the net
result is there will be no little baby fish left in Lake Erie to
grow up to be big fish,'' said Eckart, who added he's worried about
the impact on a newly revived sportfishing and recreation economy.
   ``It's another one of those unwanted foreign imports that's
costing us jobs,'' he said.
   The bills introduced by Glenn in the Senate and Rep. Henry
Nowak, D-N.Y., in the House would authorize spending $4 million a
year for five years to control the mussels and the same amount on
prevention programs to protect U.S. waters from other foreign
invaders.
   In addition, the bills require freighters to dump their ballast
water in the ocean, at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast.

   Consumer groups like the Food and Drug
Administration's plan to revamp the nation's food-labeling system,
but they say the agency can't be trusted to fulfill its promise of
stronger rules.
   ``We've been here before,'' said Ellen Haas, executive director
of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, complaining that FDA
has been trying unsuccessfully for a decade to redo the labeling
regulations.
   ``What consumers do not want is to continue in the nutritional
minefield that is the supermarket,'' she said. ``And proposals will
not get us out of that minefield _ only final action'' will.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan on Wednesday
outlined the food-labeling program the government will propose.
They include requiring disclosure of the fat, fiber and cholesterol
content of nearly all packaged foods and standardized definitions
of terms like ``low fat'' and ``high fiber.''
   Sullivan said the FDA will offer the changes in three phases,
the first of which will be formally proposed in the next six
months. After the public is given time to comment, final rules
would be published in the Federal Register sometime in 1991, he
said. The rules would take effect after that.
   But Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, said that ``in light of repeated
delays,'' legislation will be necessary to set a firm deadline for
agency to complete action.
   Bills sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, would impose requirements similar to those the
FDA said it will propose.
   The FDA proposed new food-labeling regulations during the Carter
administration in 1979, but the plan languished on the back burner
after President Reagan took office. The agency revived the effort
in the mid-1980s, proposing piecemeal changes in the system, but
few went through.
   Industry representatives complained that the FDA's plan would
not head off state efforts to extend federal regulations with their
own requirements.
   ``If everybody is concerned about confusion, then why can we not
have one uniform national labeling system that applies across the
board from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore.,'' said John Cady,
president of the National Food Processors Association.
   Sullivan said the need for new food-labeling regulations is
clear.
   ``The grocery store has become a Tower of Babel, and consumers
need to be linguists, scientists and mind readers to understand the
many labels they encounter,'' he told a food policy conference.
   ``Some food labels are hard to read and understand. Vital
information is missing, and frankly some unfounded health claims
are being made in the marketplace,'' Sullivan said. ``It's a real
mess.''
   The FDA recently proposed a regulation to toughen rules on what
health claims food marketers can make for their products. It also
is expected to go into effect fully in 1991.
   In the next six months, the FDA will issue a proposal requiring
nutrition labeling for nearly all packaged foods. This requirement
could be extended to other foods that the agency regulates,
including fresh fruit and produce, officials said.
   As part of this proposal, the FDA also wants to revise the list
of nutrients required on the label to include such items as
saturated fat, fiber, cholesterol and calories from fat.
   Meat and poultry would not be affected by the plan because those
foods are regulated by the Agriculture Department.
   Foods that have no nutrition content, such as spices, herbs and
tea, also would be exempt from the regulations, as would foods
produced by local retail bakeries and other small operations.
   Under current FDA labeling requirements, which were put in place
17 years ago, nutrition labeling is required only when a
manufacturer adds vitamins, minerals or proteins or makes a
nutritional claim about the product. About 60 percent of packaged
foods now list nutrients.
   Later this year, the FDA plans to define food descriptions such
as ``low fat'' and ``high fiber'' and determine whether to require
percentage listing of ingredients and whether specific flavors,
colors and spices should be on the label.

<HEAD>Race Livens Up: Feinstein Surges Ahead in Polls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dianne Feinstein has catapulted from
last to first in the governor's race partly because of a TV
commercial that shows her announcing the assassination of her
predecessor as San Francisco mayor.
   Feinstein's surge in the campaign to succeed retiring Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian has turned a quiet contest between two
cautious men into a lively and unpredictable race.
   During most of the past year, the 56-year-old Feinstein was the
forgotten third candidate in a race dominated by Republican U.S.
Sen. Pete Wilson and state Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a
Democrat.
   Feinstein had suffered several setbacks early in the race.
   Her recuperation from a hysterectomy canceled two months of
public appearances; her first campaign manager, Clint Reilly, quit
and complained that she was ``unwilling to commit to a schedule, an
organization and a budget,'' prompting jokes that he was the first
campaign manager to fire the candidate, and her fund-raising lagged
millions of dollars behind that of her rivals.
   Polls reported her up to 18 points behind Van de Kamp, whom she
faces in the June 5 Democratic primary, and 11 points behind Wilson
in a general election matchup. Political columnists speculated
about when she would drop out.
   But in a do-or-die effort, Feinstein and her husband, Richard
Blum, put up their own money for a $600,000 blitz of TV commercials
in late January and early February mostly in Los Angeles, where she
was not well known.
   Feinstein's 30-second commercial opens with black-and-white 1978
footage of Feinstein, then president of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, announcing at a news conference that Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk had just been shot.
   Stressing that she showed ``tough and caring'' leadership in a
time of tragedy, the commercial also cited Feinstein's pro-choice
stand on abortion and described her as ``the only Democrat for
governor for the death penalty.'' All three candidates are
pro-choice. Wilson supports the death penalty; Van de Kamp opposes
it.
   Six polls by three independent pollsters tracked a dramatic
shift from October: Van de Kamp's large lead became a large
deficit. One late February poll put Feinstein ahead, 43 percent to
24 percent. The poll also had her in front of Wilson, 44 percent to
33 percent.
   Steve Teichner, who conducted three of those six polls, said
that an unusually large 29 percent of the voters he surveyed could
describe the Feinstein commercials without prompting, and that
voters recalling the ad had a favorable impression of Feinstein by
4{-to-1.
   Teichner cautioned, however, that the large shift based on one
commercial is a sign that voters are fickle.
   ``It also means a large number of voters out there are seeking a
personality candidate,'' Teichner said. He noted that Feinstein's
standing as the first woman to seriously compete for governor of
California created a more exciting image than that of her two
rivals.
   ``The race is open and it's volatile, and nobody is questioning
any more that Dianne has a viable candidacy,'' said Feinstein
spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.
   Feinstein's sudden emergence as front-runner has dramatically
changed the tenor of the race.
   Van de Kamp, 54, shifted tactics abruptly in late February with
scathing attacks on Feinstein's fiscal, environmental and civil
rights record during her nine years as mayor.
   Wilson, 56, also has joined in, attacking Feinstein for leaving
a budget deficit for her Democratic successor in San Francisco, Art
Agnos.
   ``It's now abundantly clear that we're going to have a
Democratic primary, that we're going to have a real race,'' Van de
Kamp said.

<HEAD>Study: Abortion Pill as Effective as Traditional Abortion Methods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today demonstrating the effectiveness of
the new French abortion pill may help spur acceptance of the
treatment in other countries, a doctor says.
   The study in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes the
medicine is 96 percent effective in terminating early pregnancies.
The pill, RU 486 or mifepristone, is sold only in France, where it
has been available since 1988.
   The study's results, which duplicate earlier findings, show that
the pill works as well as vacuum aspiration, the most common form
of abortion, when taken by women up to three weeks after they miss
their menstrual period.
   The study of 2,115 women was conducted by Dr. Louise Silvestre
and others from Roussel-Uclaf, the French company that makes the
abortion pill.
   In France, the pill is now used for about one-quarter of the
120,000 abortions performed yearly but is not available for home
use. Women must take the medicine at a clinic or hospital and
return two days later for an injection of a synthetic form of the
hormone prostaglandin.
   Dr. Sheldon J. Segal of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York
noted in an accompanying editorial that Roussel-Uclaf had withheld
distribution of the drug in other countries until its effectiveness
and safety were reviewed in larger studies.
   ``The new findings reported in this issue of the journal provide
reassurance on these issues and could presage the availability of
the method in countries where comparable conditions of authorized
clinical use prevail,'' he wrote.
   No company has proposed selling the drug in the United States,
Segal said, and obtaining federal approval can take several years
once someone applies.
   Most of the women studied had temporary abdominal pain after
getting the shots, but there were few other side effects. Treatment
failures consisted mostly of incomplete expulsion of the fetus. In
those cases, the abortions were completed surgically.
   ``We conclude that the administration of mifepristone followed
by a small dose of prostaglandin analogue is an effective and safe
method for the early termination of pregnancy,'' the French doctors
wrote.
   Members of the National Right-to-Life Committee disagreed.
Richard Glasow, education director of the group, contended the
study ``offers nothing to calm concerns about the possibility of
long-term adverse side effects.''

   Senate leaders and the Bush administration are
trying to hold together a compromise clean air bill amid criticism
by some lawmakers that automobile emission controls are too weak.
   About a dozen senators were preparing to introduce today a
string of amendments that would toughen pollution controls from
auto tailpipes and require carmakers to produce more fuel-efficient
vehicles.
   The provisions are opposed by the administration as well as the
Senate's Democratic and Republican leadership.
   As senators considered a number of minor changes to the
legislation Wednesday, White House and industry lobbyists tried to
head off any major reworking of the bill, which was the product of
three weeks of closed-door negotiations.
   The legislation calls for sweeping regulations on smog-causing
pollution from automobiles and industries, requires controls on 191
toxic industrial chemicals and requires cuts in acid rain
pollutants from coal-burning electric utility plants and factories.
   As part of the compromise, a second round of automatic tailpipe
controls and a fuel economy provision were deleted from the
legislation. The auto industry has maintained that both
requirements were too expensive and perhaps not attainable.
   But several senators said Wednesday they would attempt to revive
the tougher provisions on the Senate floor.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in a letter that
the fuel economy proposal would ``have a devastating impact'' on
the auto industry and consumers, forcing automakers to concentrate
on making smaller cars.
   Proponents contended that new controls on carbon dioxide are
needed to deal with global warming. ``Carbon dioxide is responsible
for nearly half of the greenhouse effect ... and motor vehicles are
the largest single source of carbon dixoide emissions,'' said Sen.
Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   Meanwhile, some Republican senators complained late Wednesday
that the complex bill was being pushed through the Senate too
quickly.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., suggested that the bill ``was
being rammed down our throats,'' and he and Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, expressed doubt that it could be completed soon.
   But Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he wants to
finish the bill by the end of the week and might call the senators
into session Saturday to get the job done.
   The Senate begins a week-long recess next week and Mitchell
expressed concern that if debate on the legislation extends to
after the recess the compromise might fall apart.
   Meanwhile, the senators, meeting until nearly midnight
Wednesday, approved and rejected a number of amendments, mostly by
voice vote with little debate.
   Among the amendments approved were provisions:
   _Exempting fertilizer from certain reporting requirements and
agricultural tanks from other requirements under the toxic
pollution section of the bill.
   _Continuing the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency
to regulate radioactive emissions, along with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. The amendment also would allow states to
continue to impose more stringent standards on radioactive
emissions than federal standards.
   In the first roll call vote on the bill during the three days it
has been on the floor, the Senate voted 53-43 to let stand a
section of the bill that favors ethanol as part of an oxygenated
fuels program.
   Critics of the provision had claimed it unfairly promotes
ethanol, which is made from corn, as opposed to other fuels such a
methanol. Supporters, including most farm state senators, said
those concerns were unfounded.
   The provision requires that in areas not meeting federal air
quality standards, gasoline must have a 3.1 percent oxygen content
during winter months. Opponents of the measure had sought to lower
than to 2.7 percent, saying that would open the way for a broader
range of fuel blends and not just an ethanol blend.

<HEAD>Pinochet Fights To Retain Grip After Leaving Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is fighting to
retain his grip on Chile even as his 17-year-old military regime
gives way to an elected civilian government, President-elect
Patricio Aylwin says.
   Aylwin said he and Pinochet argued during a meeting Wednesday
about the military's role in the new democratic government that
takes office on Sunday.
   The 71-year-old Christian Democrat said he expressed concern
over recent legislation that grants the armed forces broad powers
and virtual autonomy under the new government.
   He also said he was alarmed by speeches in which Pinochet, who
is staying on as army commander, said he would reject any attempt
to alter the role of the military. Aylwin said Pinochet refused to
subordinate himself to a civilian defense minister, who under the
constitution commands the army leader.
   Pinochet, in a white army dress uniform, said only that the
encounter was ``very pleasant.'' He did not elaborate.
   Pinochet, 74, seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled an
elected leftist government.
   After handing over the presidency to Aylwin, Pinochet plans to
stay on as commander of the 60,000-member army. Under the
constitution approved during his rule, he can lead the army for up
to eight more years.
   Since the December elections, Pinochet has pushed through
legislation that limits the president's power to promote or retire
military officers and limits the civilian leader's power to make
military appointments.
   It also allows the army to sell any property it owns without
going through regular government procedures, among other measures.
   Aylwin said he told Pinochet he hoped the outgoing
administration had no plans to change the military's role further.
Aylwin said he feared Pinochet might introduce other administrative
measures before leaving office, but he did not elaborate.
   The 1980 constitution drafted under Pinochet makes the armed
forces ``guarantors'' of Chile's internal security and legal
framework. Aylwin and other civilian politicians maintain the
military should be only to defend Chile from other countries.
   Aylwin could change the military's role with support from
Congress.
   Wednesday's meeting was the second since Aylwin, leading a
17-party coalition, soundly defeated a Pinochet-backed candidate in
elections Dec. 14.
   The new government's relations with the military are expected to
be an area of friction for Aylwin and one that is complicated by
demands that officers who violated human rights during Pinochet's
rule stand trial.
   Hundreds of people were killed after the military seized power
in 1973, and international human rights agencies regularly
criticized Chile for grave human rights violations.
   In recognition of the elections restoring traditional democratic
rule in Chile, the U.N. Human Rights Commission on Wednesday agreed
to drop Chile from a list of countries meriting close attention
because of consistent and gross violations of civil liberties.
   Aylwin said he did not discuss the human rights issue with
Pinochet, but reiterated that his government will seek to ``find
the truth and do justice.''
   Asked whether Pinochet himself could be brought to trial, Aylwin
said, ``A trial is not in my mind.'' But he added: ``We can not
simply close our eyes and forget everything.''
   Military leaders have warned they won't accept trials.
   In a speech on Monday to military officers, Pinochet predicted
tough times for the armed forces and appealed for unity. He said he
would resist any changes in the armed forces' legal role.

<HEAD>East, West SPD Leaders Thrash Out Differences with US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading Social Democrats from East and West
Germany are seeking to thrash out their differences with U.S.
officials about the future membership of a unified Germany in NATO.
   ``This is our main theme in Washington,'' said Horst Ehmke,
deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the West German
Social Democratic Party.
   The West German party has been giving extensive campaign support
to its fledgling East German counterpart, which is widely expected
to win the March 18 East German election and form a government to
negotiate reunification with West Germany.
   ``If you read the newspapers, you might think it looks like
this: the U.S. administration says a unified Germany must be in
NATO while the SPD says a unified Germany must not be in NATO,''
said Ehmke. ``But if you look carefully, the positions are much
closer together.''
   Ehmke said the delegation had a long discussion on the issue
Wednesday with Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security
adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state.
   The SPD delegation, on a two-day visit to Washington, also
includes Marcus Meckel, deputy chairman of the East German SPD;
Hans Misselwitz, foreign policy adviser to the East German party;
and Dietrich Stobbe, former mayor of West Berlin and a current
member of the West German Bundestag.
   The group was to include Ibrahim Boehme, chairman of the East
German party, but he canceled at the last minute so that he could
campaign for the elections.
   Ehmke said no one in the U.S. administration wants to extend
military institutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
into East Germany and noted that Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III have renounced winning any security advantages in
Europe at the expense of the Soviet Union.
   He said the SPD wants to treat each of the Germanys differently
for a transition period, during which NATO would be transformed and
lead into a new security system for Europe.
   Complicating the issue is the fast-changing situation in Europe,
he said.
   ``Our problem is that no one in Washington and no one in Bonn
knows, first what the final result will look like, and how the
transformation will look,'' said Ehmke.
   ``But we are agreed that we must use something positive from
NATO, the European Community and the (European security and
cooperation) process that began in Helsinki,'' he said.
   ``That will still require much effort, but we leave here ...
with the impression that the apparent opposition turns out to be a
superfluous verbal conflict.''
   Meckel said it was clear that the NATO strategy would have to
change in any event. He noted that, for example, short-range NATO
nuclear weapons would have to be eliminated because they can only
reach East Germany.
   ``The strategy certainly cannot remain the same,'' said Meckel,
adding that elements of the North Atlantic Treaty can be expanded
to include all of Europe.
   The delegation spoke in a panel discussion organized by the
Washington office of the SPD's Friedrich Ebert Foundation.

   A jury Wednesday found the city and five police
officers used excessive force in a case of mistaken identity, and
awarded $76 million to two men who said they were shot at and
beaten.
   The jury, which deliberated about four hours, also found against
the officers and city for negligence, false arrest and malicious
prosecution.
   ``It's hard not to feel vindicated with a verdict like that,''
said one of the plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit, Gerard J. Papa, a
lawyer and Brooklyn community activist.
   ``Maybe finally there'll be a message sent and at long last the
police will learn how to police themselves,'' he said.
   The case was featured last October on the CBS program ``60
Minutes.''
   Papa, 36, was giving his friend, James Rampersant Jr., 27, a
ride home on March 12, 1986, when they were boxed in about 11:30
p.m. by two unmarked police cars.
   Police said they stopped the car because Papa and Rampersant
matched the description of a holdup team that had stolen $10 and a
ring from a woman on a Coney Island street six days earlier.
   The plainclothes officers rushed the car without identifying
themselves and with their guns drawn. Papa said he believed they
were gang members and smashed his car into the two police cars.
   The officers said they fired three shots into Papa's car after
they saw one or both of the men pull a gun. No gun was found inside
the car.
   Papa and Rampersant said they were dragged from the car, then
thrown on the ground, beaten and kicked by the five officers.
   The two men said they suffered concussions and other injuries in
the attack, including psychiatric problems such as phobias and
depression.
   The defendants denied the men were beaten and said the injuries
were the result of the car crashes.
   Papa and Rampersant were arrested and charged with attempted
murder, but the Brooklyn district attorney's office dropped all
charges three months later.
   A grand jury that investigated the incident in 1987 did not
return any criminal charges against the officers, but criticized
them for not following proper procedures.
   Papa was awarded almost $51.3 million and Rampersant $24.8
million.
   The city planned to appeal the verdict.

<HEAD>Aquarium Light Cords Recalled Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A discount and variety retailer is renewing
its call for consumers to return 39,000 potentially defective
aquarium light cords.
   McCrory Corp. said it recalled the electric light cord assembly
part of its Aqua Hex Aquariums last summer because ``the wires may
short circuit and ignite the cord'' but few people responded.
   Spokeswoman Joy Shepp said the company then advertised the
recall for seven days in January in USA Today. She said the company
had sent only 250 replacement cords as a result of the first recall.
   The cords were sold nationwide between July 1988 and February
1989 by Bargain Time, Britts, Elmore, McCrory, H.L. Green, Kress,
McClellan, T.G. &amp; Y, Silver Kittinger and Newberry stores.
   The company said in a statement that it was aware of three
incidents in which the cord short-circuited or caught fire. No
injuries have been reported, it said.
   Consumers should detach the defective light cord from the
aquarium hood and return it, without the bulb, for a replacement
from the store where it was purchased or contact McCrory Stores at
1-800-284-3704.

<HEAD>One Manufacturer Says Pillows Voluntarily Removed from Shelves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One manufacturer of infant pillows and
cushions the government said was involved in the suffocation of 10
babies in two years says it removed its product from stores earlier
this year.
   Leo Hollander, owner of Hollander Home Fashions of Newark, N.J.,
said the company stopped making its ``Mother's Helper Cushion'' in
January and told distributors to remove them from stores.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., urged the Consumer Product Safety
Commission on Tuesday to recall all the infant pillows that have
been linked to the deaths, including seven since June.
   Hollander said his company ``does not believe that its product
is responsible for the death of any infant. ... The product
labeling warns parents never to leave their children unattended.''
   He said infants under 5-months-old should never be placed face
down and left alone to sleep on any type of pillows.
   ``Furthermore no pillow should be used for very young infants in
their cribs,'' he said.
   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the company voluntarily recalled
400,000 cushions Wednesday.
   The agency said negotiations for a recall were continuing with
other companies, which it declined to identify.

<HEAD>New Rights Commission Chairman Has Heart Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Fletcher, the new chief of the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission, has undergone his second triple bypass
heart surgery in less than six months.
   Fletcher, who was named chairman by President Bush last month,
entered George Washington University Hospital on Monday after
doctors concluded previous bypass surgery ``didn't take,'' Barbara
Brooks, spokeswoman for the commission, said Wednesday.
   Hospital spokeswoman Claudia Dominitz said the surgery Wednesday
``went well. He's doing fine.''
   The 65-year-old Fletcher underwent emergency open-heart surgery
last November in Yakima, Wash., after traveling to Washington state
for a speaking engagement. Brooks said he went to the George
Washington hospital for a follow-up examination and went into
surgery again Wednesday morning.
   ``According to his wife, the other surgery didn't take,'' said
Brooks. She said doctors told family members ``his three bypass
grafts occluded and the arteries are blocked again.''
   Fletcher, who served as chairman at his first commission meeting
last week, is expected to be out recuperating for six to eight
weeks, Brooks said.

<TEXT>
   Most Americans have had their fill, and more,
of news about Donald and Ivana Trump and their martial problems,
says a new poll.
   The monthly Times Mirror News Interest Index showed a record 55
percent of the 1,226 people surveyed thought there was too much
news about the Trumps' domestic battle, by far the largest ``over
covered'' rating accorded a particular story since the poll was
started in 1986.
   Only about one in 10 Americans said they followed the Trump
story ``very closely,'' while an additional 25 percent said they
followed it ``fairly closely.'' Even in New York, just 15 percent
fell into the ``very closely'' category.
   The survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization, found no
single news story dominated public attention in the last month.
   The freeing of black South African leader Nelson Mandela and
political changes in the Soviet Union led the index, with ``very
closely'' ratings of 30 percent and 28 percent, respectively.
   A majority expressed annoyance with the media on the CBS
suspension of ``60 Minutes'' commentator Andy Rooney for allegedly
making racist remarks to a magazine interviewer.
   The suspension was disapproved by 58 percent of the respondents,
while only 24 percent approved. The CBS decision was unpopular in
majorities of every major demographic group except among blacks,
who divided about evenly _ 38 percent approved, 36 percent
disapproved.
   Rooney, who strongly denied making the disputed statements, was
reinstated after 3 weeks of the original 90-day suspension.
   The index is sponsored by the Times Mirror Center for The People
&amp; The Press. Based on the total sample of 1,226 adults, the poll
has a 95 percent chance of being within 3 percentage points of the
results which would be obtained if the entire adult population were
interviewed.

<TEXT>
   Two Army sergeants and seven Colombians were behind
bars today, charged with stuffing cocaine into duffel bags and
using military mail to smuggle the drugs from Panama to the United
States.
   The sergeants _ Raphiel Fultz and James Earl Worelds _ were
among 20 people indicted by a grand jury Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said investigators are convinced
the two were the only U.S. military personnel involved.
   ``We're confident that the scope of this operation was shut
down,'' he said.
   The indictment alleges the group made three shipments to the
United States, beginning in October with about nine pounds and
ending with an estimated 400-pound load in February. The cocaine
was packed in duffel bags, which were transported through military
mail, then passed on to the U.S. civilian postal system.
   ``It's not something new,'' said Lionel Stewart, associate agent
in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Miami.
``This system has been used for many years _ it's something we're
always looking at along with the Army.''
   Fultz, who was secretly arrested in January after a tip to drug
agents, agreed to cooperate with investigators and helped set up
the final shipment along with an Army undercover agent. On Feb. 27,
the drugs were delivered to a home in Sunrise, and the Colombians
paid him $100,000 for his part.
   The scheme began in October, well before the United States
action in Panama, and culminated in the February shipment,
indicating there was no direct connection with the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion of Panama, Lehtinen said.
   But the ring apparently took advantage of the initial U.S.
pullout in mid-January to send an estimated 70-pound shipment.
   Lehtinen strongly denied any connection between the case and the
recent grenade bombing of a Panama City nightclub or a series of
execution-style slayings in that country.
   Col. Mark Mueller of the Army's criminal investigation division
said the method used by the ring led to several previous arrests.
In 1988, four people were convicted in Columbus, Ga., in an almost
identical scheme, and that same year an Army private was arrested
for smuggling cocaine from Panama to Puerto Rico in his duffel bag.
   The Army uses drug-sniffing dogs and other methods to try to
stop smuggling through its mail system and has recently intercepted
other shipments, Mueller said.
   ``No system is perfect,'' said Mueller. ``There are checks, but
we're talking about a tremendous volume of equipment, people,
materiel, so it's difficult to check and close every hole.''
   Five people were arrested in Panama in the case and four of
them, all Colombians, were delivered to U.S. authorities here.
Under Panamanian law the fifth, a citizen of Panama, could not be
extradited, Lehtinen said.
   Three Colombians were arrested in South Florida for allegedly
receiving the final cocaine shipment in Sunrise, and 10 people, all
Colombians, are fugitives in the case.
   The military men apparently came into contact with the
small-time Colombian drug smugglers in the Panamanian port city of
Colon, Mueller said.

<TEXT>
   A study seen as ``very good news for women in
their 30s'' concludes today that those who delay motherhood until
they establish their careers face little unusual risk of delivering
premature or stillborn babies.
   The researchers did not check for Down's syndrome and other
genetic disorders _ which are more common among older women's
babies _ because virtually all the mothers underwent testing for
such problems during pregnancy.
   The study in today's New England Journal of Medicine shows that
if those in their late 30s and 40s successfully get pregnant for
the first time and avoid miscarriages, chances are good they will
have healthy children.
   The number of women delaying their first pregnancies until late
in their reproductive lives has increased dramatically. According
to federal statistics, the rate of first births among those in
their 30s has more than doubled since 1970, and among those in
their early 40s, it has increased 50 percent.
   ``Most, although not all, previous studies suggest they might be
at an increased risk of low birth weight infants and stillbirths as
well as certain other complications,'' said Dr. Gertrud S.
Berkowitz, who directed the latest study.
   ``That's why women over the age of 35 have generally been
considered to be at high risk.''
   But her study, based on 3,917 pregnancies, shows that older
women have only a slightly increased risk of producing unusually
small babies, and they are no more likely than younger first-time
mothers to deliver prematurely or have stillbirths.
   ``Overall, their data represent very good news for women in
their 30s who are contemplating their first pregnancy,'' Dr. Robert
Resnik of the University of California, San Diego, said in an
accompanying editorial.
   Berkowitz, an epidemiologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine
in New York, said her findings should reassure women who were like
those who took part in the study _ largely white, well-educated
non-smokers who had private insurance, received prenatal care and
delivered in sophisticated medical centers.
   ``Even though this is a very unique group, it typifies women who
are delaying childbearing,'' said Berkowitz. ``By and large, it is
women who are doing it for career reasons.''
   The findings do not mean, however, that women can postpone
childbearing indefinitely and still be assured of having a baby. As
women age, they become less fertile, and even when they get
pregnant, they are more likely to have miscarriages.
   The study also showed that those older than 35 are twice as
likely as younger women to have some health complications of
pregnancy, including diabetes and high blood pressure.
   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Henry Klapholz said many
doctors have come to accept that women can safely have babies into
their 40s. But, he cautioned, women over 40 may unexpectedly go
through menopause, ending all chances of pregnancy.
   ``If you are going to do it, you should do it as soon as you
can,'' Klapholz said. ``But if you want to put it off until you are
in your 30s or 40s, there is a very good chance of getting pregnant
and having a successful outcome.''
   In his editorial, Resnik said that the message of the latest
research ``is clear and highly optimistic.''
   ``Given sound genetic diagnosis and counseling, together with
appropriate prenatal care and the judicious management of labor and
delivery,'' he wrote, ``the increasing number of women postponing
first pregnancies can look forward to excellent outcomes.''

   Purveyors of American pop culture face a dilemma
with the easing of East-West tension: If the Russians no longer
qualify as bad guys, who does?
   Who will James Bond outwit? Who will G.I. Joe pulverize? Who
will Rambo vanquish singlehandedly?
   Where have all the villains gone?
   ``Where we're going to go witch-hunting next, I don't know,''
said Brian Walker, who has seen a host of bad guys vaporized or
sent to the fourth dimension in his 10-year tenure as exhibit
director of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y.
   Some suggest the new wicked ones in spy movies, comic books and
Saturday morning cartoons will be polluters; others see the
Japanese and Germans making a comeback as the baddies.
   The search for the new bad guy has its troubling side for Petra
Hesse, a college professor and a member of the Cambridge-based
Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age.
   She recently created a 13-minute video program on how children
may be affected by the images of ``the enemy'' in action cartoon
shows.
   ``The World is a Dangerous Place: Images of the Enemy on
Children's Television'' uses clips from ``Rambo,'' and ``G.I.
Joe,'' among other progreams to demonstrate how the enemy is
usually a swarthy foreigner _ or faceless monster _ who speaks with
an accent, respects no laws and is evil for the sake of being evil.
   ``At some level, yes, we do need bad guys. But I feel it's very
up in the air what that bad could be,'' she said. ``I don't mind
bad guys, but why can't we diversify?''
   Larry Hama, a former Marvel Comics editor who as an artist draws
G.I. Joe and as an actor frequently plays the bad guy, recognizes
the importance of an effective enemy. ``What is King David without
the Philistines?'' he asked.
   Villains can be more interesting than heroes, too.
   ``Look at `Batman,''' Walker said. ``The Joker was certainly not
the hero but he was definitely the star of the movie.''
   Moreover, a child needs to see his fantasies and fears come to
life, Hama said. There's that kid who ``comes over and steals his
peanut butter sandwich and stomps his face in the ground. At an
early age, you know evil exists and you want some sort of justice
done.''
   During the silent movie era, ``everyone knew bankers were evil
people. They took people's houses; they tied women to the railroad
track,'' Hama said.
   During World War II, Germans and the Japanese were the enemy.
   Nazis, especially, have served as great bad guys for 50 years,
Hama noted. From ``Casablanca'' to the Indiana Jones movies, Nazi
wore black uniforms and menacing expressions and could be counted
on to hiss, ``We have ways of making you talk.''
   ``Russian made bad bad guys,'' Hama insisted. ``They're shoddy,
they're not as cool; there's no monocle and dueling scar from
Heidelberg.''
   Hesse wonders if the Japanese and Germans could again become the
new supervillains, this time armed with microchips and driving
economy cars.
   What the world needs, Walker and Hesse said, is not necessarily
fewer villains, but more complex ones.
   Hesse contends that 4- to 5-year-olds see the world in
black-and-white terms, while 7- to 9-year-olds can grasp the
concept of a bad guy with some redeeming qualities, or an enemy
that comes from within ourselves.
   Perhaps the real bad guys to today's kids are polluters, Hesse
and Walker said. Walker envisions an action cartoon based on a
group of environmental activists, fighting oil spills and other
such threats to the Earth.
   Maybe it's hard to imagine James Bond foiling a polluter in the
same exciting style as a hand-to-high-heel combat with a blonde KGB
agent whose name is a sexual pun, but, as Walker put it:
   ``Kids are saying the enemy is not the Russians nor people in
other countries but more the greedy people raping the environment
for their own profit.''

<HEAD>$76 Million Awarded in Police Brutality Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men who were shot at and beaten by police in
a case of mistaken identity were awarded $76 million.
   A jury deliberated for four hours Wednesday before finding that
the city and five police officers had used excessive force, shown
negligence and committed false arrest and malicious prosecution.
   ``It's hard not to feel vindicated with a verdict like that,''
said one of the plaintiffs, Gerard J. Papa, a lawyer and community
activist. ``Maybe finally there'll be a message sent and at long
last the police will learn how to police themselves.''
   Papa, 36, was driving a friend home in 1986 when they were boxed
in about 11:30 p.m. by two unmarked police cars. Police said Papa
and James Rampersant Jr., 27, matched the description of a holdup
team that had stolen $10 and a ring from a woman about six days
earlier.
   Papa said he thought the plainclothes officers _ who rushed the
car with guns drawn _ were a gang and tried to escape, smashing his
car into the police cars.
   The officers said they fired three shots into Papa's car after
seeing one or both of them pointing a gun. No gun was found inside
the car.
   Lawyers for Papa, a Columbia University Law School graduate, and
Rampersant, the son of a Baptist minister, said the two were
dragged from the car, beaten and kicked by the officers.
   ``They played Hollywood, they played cowboys and these men had
the misfortune to be the Indians,'' Rampersant's lawyer, Keith
DeVries, told the jury. ``Hollywood came to Brooklyn and trampled
on the Constitution.''
   Papa and Rampersant said they both received concussions in the
attack and later suffered from psychiatric problems such as phobias
and depression.
   The city and the five officers denied any beatings occurred and
said the men were injured in the car crashes.
   Papa and Rampersant were charged with attempted murder, but
charges were later dropped. A grand jury that investigated the
incident in 1987 did not indict the officers but criticized them
for not following procedure.
   Papa was awarded almost $51.3 million and Rampersant more than
$24.8 million.
   The city said it would appeal.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Rushing To Legalize Property Titles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rush is on to legalize deeds on
thousands of houses, lots and vehicles confiscated by the
Sandinistas, who are trying to make it difficult for previous
owners to recover such property when the new government takes over.
   The Sandinistas are also moving to strip the government to bare
bones before the 14-party United National Opposition coalition
takes office April 25.
   The flurry of giveaways extends even to government office
supplies.
   ``We're going to leave them the offices empty,'' said a
pro-Sandinista City Hall secretary carting home a cardboard box
full of blank file folders.
   The secretary, who did not want her name used, said she was
hoping to get an office desk for her home, another government gift.
   Something else the incoming government will have to live without
is Cuban military aid, though it doesn't appear to be any love lost.
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba announced Wednesday in Havana
that he would cut all military assistance to Nicaragua by the time
Violeta Chamorro takes office, maybe even before.
   Castro was quoted by Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina
as saying that Cuban aid in housing construction and health care
would remain if the new government wants them.
   Neither government has ever said how much aid, military or
otherwise, Castro has been giving the Sandinistas during their
decade in power.
   In a series of increasingly defiant speeches since losing the
Feb. 25 elections, President Daniel Ortega has vowed the
Sandinistas will ``defend the conquests of the revolution.''
   The list of conquests runs from the integrity of the Sandinista
People's Army to a daily glass of milk given small schoolchildren.
   It also includes tracks of urban land seized by the government
and given to poor people, on which shantytowns have sprung up, most
without running water.
   In the seven weeks before Mrs. Chamorro is inaugurated, the
Sandinistas are trying to make confiscations legal.
   But they're also leaving an empty shell of a state structure
that will make it harder for UNO to function as a government.
   In the north-central town of Matagalpa, UNO legal adviser
Santiago Rivas said the Sandinistas are gutting state enterprises.
   He said government officials are giving state property away,
emptying sugar and coffee warehouses, registering state vehicles in
private names or selling them off.
   Although he offered no proof, Rivas said officials also are
funneling public money into foreign bank accounts.
   ``We are going to take over a government totally in ruins,''
Rivas said. ``We are inheriting a bankrupt government.''
   A bill allowing tenants to claim legal ownership of state
housing was to be read before the Sandinista-dominated National
Assembly today.
   The bill covers more than 10,000 homes nationwide. The homes
have been awarded, rented or loaned to the tenants, usually
Sandinista party militants or government officials. Many of the
previous owners were supporters, associates or relatives of
dictator Anastasio Somoza, who the Sandinistas overthrew.
   Some homes were seized by the state through the ``Law of
Absence,'' under which Nicaraguans who leave the country for more
than six months are subject to the confiscation of their property.
   The law was aimed at anti-Sandinista exiles, who fled Nicaragua
by the thousands after the July 1979 Sandinista revolution.
   But in other cases, people who just happened to be living
outside the country for longer than six months returned to find
their homes occupied by Sandinista officials.
   ``In principle, the reigning idea is to award the houses to the
people already living in them, as long as they belong to the
state,'' said Rafael Solis, first secretary and deputy of the
National Assembly.
   ``But we'll have to see what solution we give to those persons
occupying privately owned homes.''
   The single-chamber National Assembly now is dominated by the
Sandinistas, who have 61 seats to 35 from six opposition parties.
   Come April 25, however, UNO will be dominant, with election
returns showing it gained 52 seats to 39 for the Sandinistas. An
extreme-left party, the Revolutionary Unity Movement, obtained one
seat.
   UNO leaders have said they do not plan to simply return all
confiscated property, but to establish special tribunals that will
hear claims and decide on a case-by-case basis.
   Confiscated farmland that has been distributed to peasants in
cooperatives will not be returned to previous owners, UNO said.

   The Sandinista army is delivering
truckloads of assault rifles to civilians in what one international
observer calls a ``time bomb'' that could disrupt the transition to
opposition rule.
   Sandinista leaders say they'll hand over the government April
25, but their local forces don't appear ready to give their guns to
the United National Opposition, which they fear will return
confiscated land to previous owners.
   ``All the barrios have guns. They are all defending their
land,'' said Francisca Castileblanco, a party organizer in Barrio
Roger Angin, a slum of 400 homes without water and electricity on
confiscated land on the edge of Jinotega.
   Mrs. Castileblanco, a 52-year-old tortilla vendor, then went
into her house, a ramshackle shell of mismatched planks and tin
over a dirt floor, and pulled out her new AK-47.
   It is one of 400 assault rifles she and her neighbors said the
army delivered on Feb. 27, two days after UNO defeated the
Sandinistas in elections. Mrs. Castileblanco and her neighbors say
the AK-47s were distributed to anyone age 15 and over.
   The army, a party organ, is delivering truckloads of the weapons
to civilians in Jinotega and Matagalpa provinces who live in the
poor neighborhoods the leftist Sandinistas regard as their ``social
base.''
   International observers, diplomats and opposition officials are
worried about the large-scale distribution of weapons at a time
when tensions are so high.
   ``It's a time bomb,'' said Luis Serrano, part of the
Organization of American States observer team monitoring Matagalpa
and Jinotega provinces.
   High-ranking Sandinista officials in Jinotega and Matagalpa at
first denied civilians were being armed.
   When confronted with evidence, the officials asserted they were
creating a self-defense network to fend off possible attacks by
Contra forces that the Sandinistas have been battling for years.
   But they also acknowledged that guns are going to people living
on land confiscated after the 1979 revolution, areas the party
regards as its roots.
   The Sandinistas have said they will ``defend the conquests of
the revolution,'' including opposing any efforts to return land to
previous owners and possibly other aspects of the conservative
economic policies of the new government of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   UNO officials say they won't dislodge peasants from land that is
being worked, even if it was expropriated under Sandinista rule.
   ``There is a little tension,'' acknowledged Col. Manuel
Salvatierra, the regional military commander. ``There is a lot of
uncertainty about what will happen when the new government takes
over.''
   UNO officials say they have reports of arms being distributed in
several other provinces.
   UNO representatives have met with top-ranking regional officials
of the Sandinista party and the Sandinista army, said Santiago
Rivas, UNO's legal adviser in Matagalpa, 78 miles north of Managua.
   ``We've argued that they shouldn't give arms to civilians. It
could provoke a civil war,'' Rivas said in an interview.
   Sandinista gangs known as ``turbas'' have demonstrated in
Jinotega, 100 miles north of Managua, and in Matagalpa since the
election. Intimidated UNO supporters have stayed at home rather
than celebrate the coalition's resounding victory at the polls.
   ``They are afraid of provoking the Sandinistas,'' said the Rev.
Eliar Pineda, a Roman Catholic priest in Jinotega whose family
backed UNO.
   Rivas said UNO fears an attempt to destabilize the country
during the delicate transition from a leftist Sandinista government
to the UNO, with its free-market philosphy.
   ``The top Sandinista leadership seems disposed to hand over
power, but at the mid-level, there are those who want to create a
coup at the base of the party,'' he said.

   Cuba's Fidel Castro says he'll stop sending
military aid to Nicaragua when the ruling Sandinistas turn over the
government to the U.S.-backed opposition next month, Cuba's
official news agency said.
   The Communist president, increasingly isolated after the fall of
hard-line Communists in Eastern Europe last year, also accused four
former East bloc allies of becoming U.S. puppets.
   The four countries _ Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Bulgaria _ supported a U.N. resolution this week that criticized
Cuba's human rights record.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City,
quoted Castro at a speech Wednesday before a Cuban women's
organization in Havana.
   Castro had close ties with Nicaragua _ ruled by the leftist
Sandinistas for a decade _ until the general elections Feb. 25,
when Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her opposition coalition
defeated President Daniel Ortega.
   ``Our military cooperation ... will be withdrawn when the new
government takes office. It would not be possible to maintain our
presence with a government which has shown its dislike for the
Cuban revolution,'' Castro said.
   ``It is possible we could leave earlier if the Sandinistas agree
to it.'' Mrs. Chamorro is due to take office April 25.
   Castro said Cuban assistance in housing construction and health
care could continue if Nicaragua's new government desires. Cuba has
sent doctors, technicians and brigades of volunteers to help build
houses. It is generally believed some of these are military
personnel, but neither Havana nor Managua have disclosed any
figures on Cuban workers in Nicaragua.
   The Cuban president said his country would no longer supply
Nicaragua with petroleum and food. In recent days, the United
States and Britain have promised aid to Nicaragua.
   Exact figures on Cuban military aid have never been announced by
Havana or Managua. However, the U.S. State Department said in a
report last year that Moscow provided about $500 million in
military aid to Nicaragua in 1988.
   The Soviet Union has since said it would stop sending military
aid to Managua. Most observers believe Moscow has been providing
the military hardware to Nicaragua, while Cuba's aid has been more
in terms of military advisers.
   Castro blamed the United States and world events for the
Sandinista loss.
   ``Analyzing the results of the elections, they were a challenge
accepted by the Sandinistas in adverse conditions, amid a dirty war
imposed by the United States and an economic crisis generated by
the U.S. blockade,'' Castro was quoted as saying.
   ``The elections took place a few weeks after the fall of
socialist governments (in Eastern Europe), and the Sandinistas had
to make many concessions and made mistakes,'' he added. He did not
elaborate.
   He accused Eastern European governments of becoming U.S.
puppets, saying they had ``fallen into the lap of the empire that
is the enemy of mankind, the oppressor, the invader.''
   ``The governments and current leaders in Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Hungary and Bulgaria will have to accept responsibility for the
blood that spills in Cuba if the United States dares to attack our
country,'' Castro said.
   The four countries broke ranks with the Soviet Union on Tuesday
to support a U.S. resolution critical of Cuba's human rights
policies.
   The measure, described as ``very moderate'' by U.S. chief
delegate Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political prisoner, was
adopted 19-12 by the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   The resolution expressed ``concern'' at reports that witnesses
who testified before commission members visiting Cuba on an
unprecedented fact-finding mission in 1988 were subsequently
subject to arrest, harassment and other reprisals. Cuba calls such
people ``counterrevolutionaries.''
   Castro has now lost his only close friends in Latin America
leadership with the Sandinista electoral loss and the U.S. ouster
of Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama in December's invasion.
   Noriega is in a Miami jail awaiting trial on drug charges.

   A plot to extort $10 million from the Du
Pont Co. for the return of stolen trade secrets on the manufacture
of Lycra paid off in jail terms for three men.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph Longobardi sentenced the mastermind
of the scheme, 52-year-old Bruno Skerianz, to 6{ years in prison
Wednesday. His accomplices, Raul Armando Giordano, 37, and Antonio
Ruben Inigo, 40, drew 3{ years.
   The three Argentines were convicted in December of conspiracy
and attempted extortion.
   Lycra, the company's trade name for spandex, is an elastic fiber
used in swimsuits and leotards. Prosecutors said Du Pont was given
the choice of paying $10 million for the documents or having them
sold to a competitor.
   The documents were stolen from Du Pont's Lycra plant in
Mercedes, Argentina, where Giordano and Inigo had worked. Skerianz
worked for the company more than 20 years ago.
   The defendants' attorneys said they would appeal.
   Du Pont spokesman R. John Malloy said the sentences ``will be a
strong deterrent for those who might consider doing similar
things.''
   The defense claimed Skerianz did not attempt extortion. Rather,
they said, Du Pont learned he and the others had the documents and
approached them with the $10 million to keep the papers from
falling into the hands of a competitor.
   Giordano admitted through an interpreter Wednesday that he took
six or seven operations manuals from the plant.
   A fourth defendant, Jose Petrosino, is fighting extradition from
Italy.
   Du Pont controls more than half the spandex market worldwide and
sold more than $600 million of the product in 1988.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle was over charging rent to dockside
merchants, but as Anthony ``Captain Tony'' Tarracino, the former
skipper and barkeep elected mayor, put it, ``The fight was over a
lot more than you could see.''
   At stake, said the 73-year-old Tarracino, was Key West's
bohemian ambience, which some see as endangered.
   After the City Commission last month voted to charge far lower
rent than Tarracino feared, he headed to the Full Moon Cafe to
celebrate past midnight with other friends of Key West's nightly
sunset festival, a collection of vendors who sell snacks, crafts,
caricatures and tarot readings on Mallory Square Dock.
   But the effort to protect the vendors from ``big money''
interests remains an uphill fight, said Tarracino.
   ``They'll be back,'' he said. ``They're like barracudas. They
don't let up.''
   The debate over charging rent to the vendors brought out the
conflicts facing the city.
   Many businessmen say Key West must raise revenues to pay the
costs of living on a popular island, such as skyrocketing prices
for water, which must be piped in from the mainland 100 miles away,
and sewage treatment, which has become more costly because of
Florida's environmental protection push.
   ``It's just a matter of economics,'' said Richard Heyman, a
two-time former mayor who operates an art gallery. ``If you want to
be here, you're going to have to pay the price.''
   To attract well-heeled tourists and new residents, the city has
tried to change a raucous image. Officials sent a letter to
colleges warning that lawless behavior wouldn't be tolerated, and
ordinances have been passed against noise, outdoor display of
T-shirts and some pushcart vendors.
   More pricey restaurants and bars are springing up alongside such
longtime local favorites as Sloppy Joe's, Capt. Tony's and Jimmy
Buffett's Margaritaville Cafe, which has a souvenir shop in which
T-shirts carrying the lyrics of Buffett's songs celebrating the
Keys lifestyle sell for $13.95 each.
   During the City Commission meeting Feb. 26, tempers flared
during debate over a city lease with the Cultural Preservation
Society representing the sunset vendors, who had never paid rent
before. The city commission had voted 3-2 at its previous meeting
to charge $48,000 for an annual lease.
   But Commissioner Sally Lewis, moved by complaints the sunset
festival was threatened, succeeded in putting a $24,000 annual
ceiling on the rent, based on a $2 nightly charge per vendor. The
lease requires the rent go for dock improvements. Performers, who
depend upon donations, won't be charged.
   The sunset festival has evolved over two decades into a ritual
that draws hundreds of tourists each evening. While awaiting sunset
over the sea, they are entertained by offbeat performances, such as
housecats jumping through flaming hoops or a man who balances a
bicycle on his nose.
   ``The businessmen downtown saw money being made and they wanted
it,'' said Lester Gibbs, who moved 23 years ago from Festus, Mo.
``These are nickel-and-dime operations, and they're trying to take
it away from us.''
   Businessmen scoffed at arguments that what they call a flea
market is essential to the ambience that lured Ernest Hemingway and
playwright Tennessee Williams to live and write here.

<HEAD>Relief at Last? College Tuition Increases May Be Easing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many schools are announcing some of the smallest
tuition increases in a decade, and some college officials attribute
that to cost-cutting moves with resultant savings being passed on
to students.
   But some higher education leaders believe next fall's modest
increases also are a response to a growing sense of outrage among
students, legislators and others after a decade in which tuition
increases far outstripped inflation.
   ``I think we're approaching the end of the big increases,'' said
Robert Atwell, president of the American Council of Education.
   ``What's doing it is the demographics, the student response, the
legislative response in some cases, the governing boards getting
interested in this issue, the editorial boards of newspapers and
magazines.''
   Especially sobering, said Atwell and others, has been a recent
falloff in applications at many colleges, including top ones such
as Harvard, suggesting that schools no longer can simply raise
their rates with impunity.
   Stanford University is raising fixed student fees by 5.25
percent in 1990-91 to $20,210, the smallest increase in 15 years,
and considerably less than the 8 percent hike in the current year.
The smaller increase results from a $22 million cost-cutting
program, school officials said.
   This week, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced its
rates next fall will rise to $20,700, a 7.1 percent increase,
compared to 7.2 percent the previous year.
   The University of Michigan and Wayne State University are
holding increases to the lowest level in years _ 6.5 percent. A
year ago, Michigan posted a 9.6 percent increase.
   The Iowa Board of Regents, which oversees the University of
Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa,
approved a 3 percent rise for 1990-91, the smallest in a decade.
   Columbia College announced a 5.7 percent increase, the smallest
in more than 20 years.
   Harvard's fall tuitions won't be announced until later this
month, but spokesman Peter Costa said fees probably will be up 5
percent to 7 percent.
   Average tuitions rose 5 percent to 9 percent during the current
school year, according to the College Board's most recent annual
college cost survey.
   Costs rose in double digits from 1981 through 1984. Rates at
four-year public colleges shot up 20 percent in 1983-84. They
leveled into the 5-9 percent range for the past five years.
   Still, some like Richard Rosser, president of the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, aren't ready
to declare an end to the college cost spiral.
   He and others point out that next fall's announced increases are
``all over the map,'' with some still in double digits. And
students on several campuses have protested steep increases in
recent weeks.
   Such protests would seem to indicate a mood change from previous
years when students paid their tuition with barely a murmur even as
rates were climbing by as much as 20 percent.
   Next fall's more modest increases also may reflect nervousness
in academia over a continuing U.S. Justice Department investigation
of at least 56 private colleges. The probe is looking into whether
school officials are improperly collaborating in setting tuition
and financial aid.

<TEXT>
   Today's editions of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
hit the streets without bylines as reporters and columnists
withheld their names to express unhappiness over a proposed
contract.
   The ``byline strike,'' which began Wednesday, was approved in a
vote Sunday by Local 47 of the St. Louis Newspaper Guild.
   About 600 union members have been working without a contract
since their old pact expired midnight Feb. 28. The Guild, the
largest of 11 unions at the newspaper, is one of six that have not
reached agreement on a new contract.
   Talks between the newspaper and its unions were to resume today.
   Herb Goodrick, the local's executive director, said Wednesday
that he thought the byline strike, the first in the paper's
history, was effective.
   ``It's to show that they're embarrased to put their name on a
paper that takes the bargaining position that the Post has taken,''
Goodrick said.
   Photographers also were withholding their names from photo
credits.
   Publisher Nicholas Penniman had no comment other than to say
that the writers were within their rights to withhold their bylines
under the contract.
   The dispute comes at a time when the Post-Dispatch has new
competition _ the non-union St. Louis Sun, started in the fall by
Ingersoll Publications Co. The Post-Dispatch, founded in 1878, is
owned by Pulitzer Publishing Co.
   Goodrick said two issues _ drug testing and a system that would
pay new hires lower wages _ prevented acceptance of a contract
proposal in October.
   But the company's latest proposal deleted a 4 percent
cost-of-living increase and added other points of disagreement,
including the denial of sick leave to employees who contract
illnesses through ``immorality.''
   Goodrick said the union had not threatened a real strike against
the newspaper.
   ``At this point we've tried to be very restrained and
responsible,'' Goodrick said. ``Our objective is to get an
agreement. A strike is one of the tools for that, but we think
there are other steps we can take before that.

<TEXT>
   A special court has sentenced three
``prominent hashish traders'' to hang under the military
government's get-tough drug policy.
   The defendants, who were not identified, had ``big quantities of
hashish'' with them when they were captured, the official Sudan
News Agency reported Wednesday night.
   Reporting from Wad Medani, 105 miles southeast of Khartoum, the
agency did not give the date of execution set by Col. Awad
Khairalla, the court president, or other details.
   The court's action brought to five the number of narcotics
smugglers or traders sentenced to die since Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir's military junta took power June 30 and made drug-dealing
a capital crime.
   One was hanged in Khartoum last year.

<HEAD>China Accuses Foreign Journalists Of Illegal Activities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China today denied its security forces have
stepped up surveillance of foreign reporters, and implied that
journalists' complaints of harassment were a ``smokescreen'' for
illegal activities.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing also denounced a U.S.
Embassy investigation into intimidation of American journalists in
Beijing, calling it interference in China's internal affairs.
   Correspondents from nearly a dozen foreign news organizations,
including those from the United States, Europe and the Soviet
Union, say they have been followed or their Chinese sources
harassed by Chinese plainclothes police in recent weeks.
   Li, who has so far refused a request by foreign correspondents
to discuss the alleged harassment, said such reports were
``groundless.''
   ``If the report was the result of oversensitivity to the extent
of excessive suspicion on the part of a few correspondents, well,
that would not matter much,'' Li said.
   ``But if it was the result of an attempt by certain individuals
to create by spreading rumors a smokescreen for their own illegal
activities and to extricate themselves from their predicament or
worse still to deliberately disrupt the stability and unity in
China for ulterior purposes, that would indeed call for the
vigilance of all kind-hearted people, including large numbers of
media people.''
   Reporters who carry out normal and legitimate news coverage
``need not worry that they might run into troubles,'' he said.
   He said the U.S. State Department had ``no right'' to direct the
embassy in Beijing to investigate the alleged intimidation of
American journalists.
   ``Should an investigation be really necessary, the
justice-upholding people in the world would have every reason to
ask, how many things has this superpower done in broad daylight
over the years to trample upon the sovereignty and infringe upon
the human rights of other nations?''
   He added, referring to the U.S. invasion of Panama: ``How many
innocent Panamanians were killed and how many houses and how much
property were destroyed? How many people were rendered homeless and
deprived of their basic freedoms?''
   U.S.-China relations, which plummeted after China's military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in June, hit another low
point last month after the State Department issued a report
detailing widespread abuses of human rights in China. China has
responded by assailing the United States' human rights record and
its interference in the affairs of other countries.
   The surveillance of foreign reporters appeared to step up after
martial law was lifted in Beijing on Jan. 11, with some journalists
saying they have been tailed even while jogging or shopping.
   Journalists say Chinese security agents have also tried to
photograph their meetings with Chinese sources and have
interrogated their Chinese contacts.

<TEXT>
   People who want to hold cigarette makers liable
for their products got a discouraging signal from a jury that ruled
American Tobacco Co. shouldn't be held accountable for a smoker's
lung-cancer death, a lawyer said.
   ``This just puts a further chill on anyone having the audacity
to take on one of the empires of industry,'' said Eric Nissen, one
of the attorneys who brought the lawsuit.
   A federal jury ruled in favor of the cigarette company Wednesday
after a three-week trial. The case marked one of the rare occasions
such a suit had reached the courtroom.
   In 1988, a federal jury in New Jersey awarded the first damages
against a cigarette company, giving $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone,
whose wife died of lung cancer. But an appeals court this year
overturned the award and ordered a new trial.
   Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who
heads a project that helps lawyers who sue tobacco companies,
predicted the American Tobacco case would be appealed.
   But he added that the ruling in the Boston case ``means you need
to have a little more to go on than simply a failure to warn.''
   The suit was filed by Joanne Kotler of Cambridge, whose husband,
George, started smoking when he was 11. He died of lung cancer in
1986 at 55.
   The plaintiffs argued that American Tobacco, a subsidiary of
American Brands Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., should have warned the
public of the dangers of cigarette smoking before the government
required warning labels in 1966.
   Andrew Lane, an attorney for American Tobacco, declined to
comment on the verdict. Earlier Wednesday, during closing
arguments, he stressed that Kotler had ample opportunity to quit
smoking but chose to continue his habit.
   ``In spite of today's decision, I still feel that my husband's
generation of smokers was consciously misled about the dangers of
smoking,'' said Mrs. Kotler. ``I do know that this is one battle,
and the war still can be won. It's not over, and this case isn't
over.''
   Lane told the jury Wednesday that the first credible evidence
linking lung cancer to smoking surfaced in the 1950s, but the
studies were not definitive and some medical experts disagreed with
the findings. He further argued that warnings would not have made a
difference for Kotler.
   ``Forty million people have stopped smoking,'' Lane said. ``They
made the decision. That's what this case is really about _ choice.''
   Garry Inge, representing Mrs. Kotler, said the addictive nature
of nicotine contributed to Kotler's habit.

   In this Wild West town, voters
had enough of a mayor so tough that he allegedly mowed his lawn
with a gun strapped to his leg.
   In a recall vote Tuesday, Mayor Richard Hill lost in a showdown
with voters by a 2-1 ratio. Two councilmen _ Bruce Freels and Kurt
Larrecou _ also lost by in lopsided votes.
   ``It's always a blood bath in San Juan,'' said Jill Bohn,
organizer of the recall. ``People got to council meetings instead
of watching `Jeopardy.'''
   Residents in the town about 40 miles south of San Jose said that
Hill, Larrecou and Freels treated town employees poorly.
   But Hill's alleged activities had townspeople buzzing the most.
   Police, investigating a report of gunfire at Hill's home a few
years ago, found Hill with a bandoleer across his chest, a knife in
his boot, a pistol at his side and a shotgun across his lap. They
also found a bullet hole in his ceiling.
   Hill, a reserve police officer, said he had killed a pit bull in
the line of duty, and was expecting the dog's owner to arrive.
   Several townspeople also said that Hill would mow his lawn
wearing a gun.
   Hill, 42, denied that. ``Maybe I should,'' he said. ``I've got
some big weeds out back.''

   County commissioners hope they've
stopped residents of a subdivision from killing a native plant:
poison ivy.
   Broward County planners say residents of the Oak Knoll
subdivision have been going beyond their property lines to hunt
poison ivy, clip tree branches, plant their own landscaping and
dump lawn clippings.
   Planners say residents are trampling on a protected public
nature preserve near the subdivision.
   The County Commission threatened Tuesday to fence the yards
unless the families stopped destroying vegetation. They ended up
agreeing to wooden posts placed at the lot's corners to make sure
homeowners stay on their side.
   ``Poison ivy, while none of us likes it, is part of the native
vegetation there,'' County Commissioner Lori Parrish said.
   Some residents thought the concern over poison ivy was strange.
   But resident James Inklebarger said people would cope with the
decision.
   ``We'll keep the calamine lotion handy,'' he said.

   Fire broke out today in a kitchen at the
luxury Nile-side Shepheard Hotel in downtown Cairo but was
extinguished in less than an hour, officials and witnesses said.
   Police on the scene said the only casualty was a hotel worker
treated for smoke inhalation. Damage was minimal, they said.
   A week ago, another five-star Cairo hotel was devastated by a
nine-hour fire, which officials said was accidental.
   The 12-story hotel, a block from the U.S. and British embassies,
is in Garden City, Cairo's embassy row. The witnesses said smoke
began billowing from the roof shortly before 10 a.m.
   The 281-room hotel, owned by the government's Egyptian Hotels
Co., had an occupancy of ``almost 90 percent'' at the time of the
fire, but most guests had left their rooms when it broke out, hotel
officials said.
   Maj. Gen. Fakhreddin Khalid, chief of tourist police, said the
fire began in the ground-floor kitchen of an Asian food restaurant
and sent smoke up a chimney to the roof, where it was seen
throughout the neighborhood.
   He said the the thick smoke was caused partly by sparks from the
kitchen touching fat and grease inside the chimney. There was
``hardly any damage'' to the hotel, he said.
   Last week, an early-morning fire driven by strong winds
devastated the 630-room Heliopolis Sheraton Hotel on Cairo's
northeastern outskirts. Seventeen guests, including four Americans,
died, and 70 people were injured.
   Authorities said the Heliopolis Sheraton fire was sparked by an
oven in a tent restaurant immediately behind the hotel building.

<TEXT>
   A woman was sentenced to five years in
prison for shooting her husband to death after an argument over her
cooking that climaxed some 27 years of beatings and drunken abuse.
   Judge William E. Crane on Wednesday imposed the maximum sentence
for a conviction of homicide by negligent use of a weapon, despite
testimony that Virginia Eagan suffered an abuse-related emotional
disturbance known as battered wife syndrome.
   ``People have to face up to responsibility,'' Crane said.
``Battered woman syndrome doesn't warrant killing someone.''
   Mrs. Eagan was convicted by a jury Jan. 31 of shooting her
husband of 32 years, Eugene Eagan, during a July 2 argument.
   Eagan, 56, was disabled since a work accident and walked with
the help of canes, with which he often beat his wife, according to
both the prosecutor and defense attorney.
   Mrs. Eagan said the beatings had begun five years into the
marriage.
   Trial testimony indicated the shooting followed a Sunday evening
quarrel in which Eagan criticized the way his wife cooked boiled
potatoes and beets.
   Mrs. Eagan grabbed a handgun from the pantry and shot her
husband once at close range after he taunted her, saying: ``You
don't have any guts. You won't do it.''
   Defense Attorney George Curtis said that imprisoning Mrs. Eagan,
53, a factory worker who is going blind, was cruel and compounded
the family's tragedy.
   ``This lady has gone through hell and doesn't deserve another
minute of it. She was a helpless victim,'' Curtis said.

<TEXT>
   A small earthquake hit Southern California
today, shaking up residents still jittery from an earlier tremor
but there were no reports of injuries or damage.
   The 3.0 magnitude quake struck at 3:03 a.m., said Bob Finn,
spokesman for the seismology lab at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena. It was centered 2 miles west of Highland
Park, he said.
   ``I was asleep and it felt like some shook the hell out of my
bed,'' said Chris Harris of Hollywood. ``I hardly ever wake up, but
this time I did. Nothing fell down but the pictures on the wall are
at an angle.''
   ``It felt pretty small and quick here,'' said county sheriff's
Deputy Rafael Estrada from downtown headquarters.
   Pasadena police reported several calls from shaky residents.
Glendale police dispatcher Anna Maria Taylor said the department
received about five calls.
   Another sharp jolt, which struck 10:25 p.m. Wednesday,
registered 3.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion, said Finn,
calling it an aftershock of the destructive 5.5 magnitude Upland
quake last week.
   The aftershock was centered about 4 miles north-northeast of
suburban Pomona, which is about 30 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles. No injuries or damage were reported.
   This morning's Los Angeles area quake was ``not at all related
to the Upland quake,'' Finn said.
   The 5.5 quake that struck the suburban Upland Feb. 28 was the
biggest shaker in California since the devastating earthquake that
struck the San Francisco area last October, causing dozens of
deaths and billions of dollars in damage.
   Between 400 and 500 aftershocks have occurred since last week's
quake, Finn said. He noted only a few dozen were big enough to be
felt.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>City Bucks the Trend, Encourages Private Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city with rising unemployment is offering a
prize and tax breaks to new private businesses, a report said
today, in a break with the current anti-capitalist trend.
   The northeast industrial city of Shenyang has started a ``Glory
Cup'' competition for people starting private businesses who create
jobs for themselves or others, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   It said one city district set aside the equivalent of $83,000 to
help start new private businesses, and Shenyang was offering
preferential treatment in taxation and simplified bureaucratic
procedures.
   ``Li Zidan, a tailor, said she was perplexed and discouraged
because of disputes about individual businesses in the past few
months,'' Xinhua reported. ``But since the municipal government
launched the Glory Cup competition, she has felt confident about
the future of the private sector.''
   Li is not the only confused and discouraged entrepreneur.
   Ever since conservative leaders cracked down on massive
pro-democracy protests last year, the state media have harshly
attacked private businessmen for making too much money and living
better than ordinary workers.
   Local governments started policing them for tax payment and
enforcing other formerly ignored regulations, forcing many out of
business. Banks stopped loaning them money.
   Top Communist Party officials branded them ``bourgeois'' and
said the private sector must be controlled so it does not threaten
the socialist system. The number of private businesses dropped 14.4
percent, to 12.4 million.
   Shenyang's pro-private measures seem a case of ideology being
defeated by practical considerations. Xinhua quoted local officials
as saying that state companies do not have enough openings for new
middle school graduates.
   The number of unemployed could reach 103,000 this year, about 3
percent of the non-farming population of 3.3 million, it said.
   The actual figure is probably far higher, as Chinese
unemployment figures do not include young people who are waiting to
be assigned their first job, or workers idled by factory slow-downs
or temporary shut-downs.
   The national government also may be forced to soften it stand
toward private businesses.
   The State Planning Commission has said that 12 million people
will enter the urban work force this year, but government offices
and state factories will be able to employ only 5 million. The rest
will be forced to seek work in collective enterprises, such as
small factories run by neighborhood committees, or the private
sector.
   Liu Minxue, director of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce, said recently that while private business must be
only a supplement to the state-owned economy, the country should
help them ``develop in a healthy way.''

<TEXT>
   Communist rebels killed an elderly
American rancher on the central Philippine island of Masbate after
he refused to pay ``revolutionary taxes,'' Filipino and U.S.
officials said today.
   The victim, Stewart Frank Raab, was the second American killed
by Filipino rebels in a month and the fifth in the past year.
   Raab, 76, was seized Tuesday by about 30 New People's Army
guerrillas at his ranch near Milagros, 240 miles southeast of
Manila, Maj. Leo Pangilinan said by telephone from Masbate.
   The guerrillas forced Raab from his vehicle and shot him in the
head, Pangilinan said. U.S. Embassy officials confirmed the report
and said Raab was born in the Philippines, when it was still an
American colony.
   According to Pangilinan, Raab had been paying ``revolutionary
taxes'' _ or protection money _ until the rebels increased the fee
to $34,000 a year.
   After refusing to pay, Raab began receiving death threats,
Pangilinan said. One week before he was slain, rebels ransacked his
home and took a television, video recorder and assorted weapons and
ammunition, the major said.
   The rebels fled with Raab's clothing and personal effects after
the killing, Pangilinan said.
   On Feb. 21, rebels killed geologist John Robert Mitchell, 42, of
Fairbanks, Alaska, his Filipino wife and father-in-law in an ambush
on the central island Bohol.
   One rebel arrested in the killing said gunmen were out to get
Mitchell's father-in-law for failing to pay ``revolutionary taxes.''
   In September, rebels killed two American civilians working at a
U.S. military installation about 60 miles north of Manila on the
day Vice President Dan Quayle arrived for an official visit.
   In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe in an
ambush on a busy street in suburban Quezon City. Rowe, a Vietnam
War hero, was assigned to the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group
in the Philippines.
   In October 1987, three Americans and a Filipino civilian were
killed by rebels in a series of attacks around Clark Air Base, 50
miles north of Manila.
   Rebels have repeatedly threatened to target Americans because of
U.S. support for President Corazon Aquino. The New People's Army
has been waging a 21-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state.

<HEAD>A Dime Late; And 54 Dollars Short</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dime's worth of difference is nothing to
sneeze at where the Internal Revenue Service is concerned.
   When Mary Frances Stinson of Dorchester, Mass., filed her tax
return in 1987, she was 10 cents short on her payment. Nearly three
years later the IRS notified her that the 10-cent debt had grown to
$54.94 because of interest and penalties.
   The computer-generated form letter said the IRS had assessed a
$24 late-payment penalty plus $30.84 interest on the late payment.
However, the billing noted that under the law, the penalty cannot
exceed 25 percent of the late payment _ in this case that would be
2 cents.
   The interest rate charged on late payments has been averaging
around 10 percent, or about a penny a year calculated from the
April 15, 1987, due date of Ms. Stinson's return to the Oct. 30,
1989, date of the IRS's late-payment letter.
   Ms. Stinson took her case to the National Coalition of IRS
Whistleblowers, a Washington-based organization established by the
Church of Scientology, which gave a copy of the bill to a reporter.
   Ms. Stinson could not be reached to determine the outcome of the
case, and the IRS is prohibited by law from comment on tax files.
   However, IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely said today that since a
stamp costs 25 cents, ``I wouldn't think we would even send a
notice on 10 cents due.'' If an erroneous bill is sent, he added,
``you should just write and tell us.''

   Security forces fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse hundreds of Palestinian women who staged
anti-occupation marches today in the West Bank and Arab east
Jerusalem, police and Arab reports said.
   At least 17 demonstrators were hit by rubber bullets or
rubber-coated metal balls, including a teen-ager shot and wounded
in the head, Arab reporters said. One of the protests was broken up
in the walled Old City of Jerusalem.
   Army and police said they were checking the casualty reports.
   The demonstrations were organized by underground leaders of the
27-month-old Palestinian uprising to coincide with International
Women's Day.
   Protesters carried placards calling on Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to negotiate with the PLO and demanding a Palestinian state.
   ``Shamir, you must talk to the PLO,'' read a banner carried in a
march of about 200 women in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``Yes
to the Cairo dialogue that will lead to an international peace
conference,'' said another placard held by marchers in the biblical
West Bank city of Bethlehem.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, refuses to negotiate
with the PLO, saying it is a terror organization. His fear that the
PLO would dominate Palestinian negotiatiors has held up a
U.S.-supported plan to hold preliminary negotiations between
Palestinians and Israel in Cairo.
   One of the worst clashes today occurred in Israeli-annexed east
Jerusalem, where riot police fired rubber bullets to disperse about
100 Palestinian women near the walled Old City's Damascus Gate. At
least six women were hit by rubber bullets, according to
journalists at the scene.
   Following the march, Palestinian youths took to nearby streets
throwing stones and empty bottles at passing Israeli cars, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   About one dozen demonstrators also overturned an Israeli car in
nearby Salah Edin Street, said Associated Press reporter Haitham
Hamad. The youths also broke the windows of a car belonging to a
tax collector.
   Six mounted policemen and officers on foot carrying shields and
clubs chased the youths who escaped into the bustle of east
Jerusalem's central bus station. Sandori said 10 Palestinians were
arrested.
   There have been sporadic anti-Israeli protests in east
Jerusalem, which Palestinians consider the capital of a state they
hope to establish one day. But the violence has been far less than
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   In Ramallah, troops fired rubber bullets at about 200 women, and
chased the fleeing demonstrators into the city's old market, Arab
reporters said.
   Ten women hit by rubber bullets were treated at Ramallah
Hospital and released, a hospital official said.
   Another demonstration of about 200 women in the West Bank town
of Jenin was dispersed when soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber-coated bullets, Arab reports said.
   Hospital officials said a 17-year-old girl was injured in the
head by a rubber-coated metal ball, but an army spokesman denied
soldiers fired such ammunition. The rubber-coated metal balls are
more likely to cause serious injuries than rubber-coated bullets.
   In Nablus, also in the West Bank, soldiers fired tear gas to
disperse about 400 women, and confiscated Palestinian flags and
banners, Arab reports said. One of the banners raid, ``Yes to the
Palestinian peace process.''

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed five
Shiite Moslem guerrillas today in south Lebanon, officials in
Lebanon and Israel said.
   The guerrillas involved in the pre-dawn clash were members of
the pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalist group Hezbollah, said Maj.
Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the Israeli army's Northern Command.
   ``They apparently came to attack one of our positions or to
plant explosives in the security zone,'' a six-to-10-mile area in
southern Lebanon that is controlled by Israel and allied
militiamen, Peled said on Israel radio.
   A security source in Lebanon, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Israelis opened fire with tank cannons killing
five guerrillas after spotting the squad in the Zommaraya district
of the security zone.
   A fierce battle with machine guns, automatic rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades ensued after the Israeli assault, as
other guerrillas tried to recover the bodies, the source said.
   Israeli officials said the guerrillas were armed with large
quantities of explosives, hand grenades and five Soviet-made
Kalashnikov rifles, the radio reported. The military said Israel
suffered no casualties in the encounter.
   Israel radio quoted sources in the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Lebanon as saying Israeli-backed militiamen of the South Lebanon
Army exchanged mortar fire with guerrillas through the morning.
   Guerrillas later fired a salvo of about six Katyusha rockets at
an Israeli army outpost in the town of Hasbaya, on the eastern edge
of the zone.
   The day's fighting was the first clash in south Lebanon between
Israeli forces and guerrillas since Feb. 14, when one guerrilla was
slain and three captured. Israel has since staged three bombing
raids against guerrilla targets in south Lebanon.
   Israel maintained control over the border area across south
Lebanon when it withdrew the bulk of its invading army in the
summer of 1985, three years after they moved over the border. The
zone serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks in
northern Israel.

<HEAD>New Journal of No-Apologies Liberalism To Be Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of writers and academics is starting a
journal with the aim of bringing liberal ideas back to the top of
the national agenda.
   The American Prospect, scheduled to debut Sunday and be
published quarterly, ``marks the rebirth of no-apologies
liberalism,'' according to a release.
   ``We're not neo-liberals, or post-liberals or any other hybrid.
We're liberals,'' said co-editor Robert Kuttner.
   The entry of the journal coincides with the exit of the Cold War
and its attending fixation on military issues, the editors said.
   ``A lot of the antagonisms that arose in the 1960s have died
out,'' said Paul Starr, a Princeton University sociologist who will
be one of the magazine's two editors. ``We think America's
challenges today are mainly social and economic.''
   The first issue contains several meditations on the role of
liberalism in the 1990s, a feature article on ``The Real Welfare
Problem'' and a pollster's blueprint on how the Democratic Party
can reclaim middle-class votes without moving to the right of the
political spectrum.
   The journal's board of sponsors includes economist John Kenneth
Galbraith, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Marian Wright
Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense fund.
   Who will pay $7.95 for the journal?
   ``My simplistic vision is of a great emerging army of liberal
people who don't have anything to attach themselves to, no clear
policy directions, no distinct political directions, no distinct
public philosphy, certainly no leaders,'' Robert Reich, a Harvard
University economist and chairman of the editorial board, said in
The New York Times.

<HEAD>IRS Will Go to Court to Get Lawyers to Disclose Sources of Cash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is prepared to go
to court to force 90 defense lawyers in drug cases to tell the
source of large cash fees.
   ``We are talking about the hard-nut cases where we have made
repeated attempts to get the information and have not been
successful,'' says IRS public-affairs director Ellen Murphy.
   The IRS, which is playing a major role in the government's
battle against illegal drugs, is acting under a 1985 law requiring
anyone accepting a cash payment of $10,000 or more to file a Form
8300 spelling out the source of the money.
   The agency wrote 965 lawyers last fall that the forms they had
filed were incomplete. Since that time, Ms. Murphy said, all but 90
have supplied the required information. Those 90 cases have been
referred to IRS district offices around the country.
   ``In those cases, we plan to pursue summonses in order to get
the information,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``If we don't get compliance
with the administrative summonses, we will refer the cases to the
Department of Justice for enforcement action in District Court.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the department
``has assured the IRS that each case will be reviewed on its merits
to determine whether a summons enforcement proceeding should be
instituted.''
   Continued refusal to provide the information could result in
jail sentences for the attorneys.
   Neal Sonnett of Miami, president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, predicted attorneys will go to jail
rather than comply. ``We cannot allow in this country the war
against drugs to become the war against lawyers and a war against
the Bill of Rights, and that's what's happening,'' Sonnett said.
   Ms. Murphy acknowledged that ``there is obviously the
attorney-client privilege issue in these cases, but we believe that
has been addressed in the instructions for Form 8300.''
   ``This is a form that can be avoided simply by not accepting
large cash payments. We are talking about $10,000 paid in a lump
sum,'' Ms. Murphy said.
   A former federal prosecutor who specialized in drug cases said
the information sought by the IRS would enable investigators to
piece together tax cases against suspected drug dealers.
   ``If all of a sudden a drug dealer is shown paying $25,000 in
cash in legal fees, all of a sudden he has to account for $25,000.
It identifies the fact that individuals have assets,'' said the
former prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   James Holden, chairman of the tax division of the American Bar
Association, said the dispute between lawyers and the IRS is likely
to end up before the Supreme Court.
   ``This is something of a Holy Grail issue with attorneys, much
like the First Amendment is with publishers,'' Holden said.
   ``I think it is unfortunate that Congress included lawyers''
when requiring any person with a trade or business _ such as car
dealers, furriers or jewelers _ to report receiving $10,000 or more
in cash, he said.
   Holden said the ABA is asking the Justice Department ``to
exercise discretion in deciding whether to seek court action, to
look at each case carefully and see whether there is a legitimate
claim of attorney-client privilege.''

<HEAD>Panel To Seek Immunity For Former Pierce Aide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee will ask a federal court
to grant immunity to a top deputy to Reagan administration Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. in return for his testimony about
abuses at the agency, sources said today.
   The former Pierce deputy, Dubois Gilliam, is currently serving a
federal prison sentence for a conviction in a HUD-related case, and
according to subcommittee sources the panel will ask that the court
approve an immunity grant protecting him from further prosecution.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said former
federal judge Arlin Adams, who is the independent counsel leading
an investigation of Pierce and several top aides, did not object to
the request to grant Gilliam immunity.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, has predicted the independent
counsel will exonerate Pierce of any wrongdoing. Perito questioned
whether Gilliam would provide accurate testimony or would seek to
curry favor for a reduced sentence.
   The panel chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., was to announce
the plans at a news conference today. The development was first
reported in today's editions of The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal.
   Gilliam, according to the sources, is expected to testify that
Pierce directed him to steer Department of Housing and Urban
Development money to political and business allies. Subcommittee
aides recently met with Gilliam at the federal prison in Lompoc,
Calif., where he is serving an 18-month sentence.
   Pierce and several former top aides have refused to testify
before the subcommittee, citing their Fifth Amendment rights
against self-incrimination. Among them was Deborah Dean, Pierce's
former top aide. The panel considered granting her immunity but has
dropped the idea. Gilliam would be the first witness to appear
under such an arrangement.
   Gilliam, as part of a plea agreement in the Mississippi case,
pleaded guilty to accepting cash gifts from a HUD contractor and
conspiring to use a HUD grant for personal gain.
   Gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary for community
development at HUD and considered one of Pierce's most trusted
aides. Documents released last year by HUD under the Freedom of
Information act show that requests for funds often were routed
through Gilliam.
   His job gave him immediate supervision over a technical
assistance program whose funding was largely discretionary. Many
awards under the program were made after contractors made
unsolicited proposals to the department, and HUD auditors have
roundly criticized the program for allowing contractors to use the
bulk of their cash for personnel and overhead costs.
   Gilliam's division at HUD also oversaw the Urban Development
Action Grant program, which is now virtually defunct but was a
favorite of municipal officials seeking federal money for a variety
of development projects.

<TEXT>
   Ann Richards got an endorsement for her
Democratic campaign for governor she didn't expect or necessarily
want, from editors of a Texas death row newspaper.
   ``If I were forced to, I'd choose Ann Richards,'' Robert West,
editor of Endeavor, a newspaper written and produced by the men on
death row, said Wednesday. ``I think she's just trying to be a
human being. I think she recognizes people can change because she's
a recovering alcoholic.''
   James Beathard, an assistant editor, also said he would favor
Ms. Richards, saying the Texas treasurer appeared to be
concentrating more on issues like schools, minorities, women's
rights and the budget. But he added that inmate support for Ms.
Richards likely would hurt her rather than help her in the election.
   ``But it's us they're trying to kill, and we should have a right
to comment about the people who are trying to kill us,'' said
Beathard, awaiting death for a 1984 spree in which three people
were killed.
   Asked to comment on the inmates' endorsement, Ms. Richards,
campaigning in San Antonio for Tuesday's primary, first thought the
question was a joke.
   ``I don't know what possibly could have engendered it,'' she
said. `I don't know anybody on death row. My view on the death
penalty is that it's the law and that the law should be carried out.
   ``I think perhaps they are contrasting me with a guy who goes on
TV and struts up and down in front of pictures of people who have
been executed. It's macabre and strange. What I think this campaign
is about is life.'' law.''
   Capital punishment has been the focus of television commercials
from Ms. Richards' two Democratic opponents, Attorney General Jim
Mattox and former Gov. Mark White. In their ads, Mattox and White
take credit for making Texas the nation's leader in executions
among states that have the death penalty. Since Texas resumed the
death penalty in 1982, 33 men have been given lethal injections.
   Endeavor editors and other inmates were particularly upset with
a White commercial in which large pictures of the executed
prisoners are used as props.
   Inmate Lester Bower, who closely follows capital punishment
legal issues, estimated about half of the more than 300 Texas death
row inmates were eligible to vote since their direct appeals still
were pending. Once a conviction is affirmed by the Supreme Court,
the inmate loses his right to vote, said Bower, awaiting death for
the slayings of four men in 1983.
   The newspaper, in existence for nearly a year, is believed to be
the only one of its kind among the nation's death rows.

   Joseph Melvin Lyle, a vice admiral in the
Navy Supply Corps who was director of the Defense Supply Agency
before retiring in 1967, has died at the age of 77.
   Lyle, who held some of the highest logistics posts in the armed
services, died of cancer Tuesday at a nursing home.
   A resident of Reston, Lyle was born in Augusta, Ga. He graduated
from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1935.
   He was an assistant supply officer at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when
the Japanese attacked it on Dec. 7, 1941. He remained in Pearl
Harbor until 1944, then spent the next two years as supply officer
at the Norfolk Naval Air Station in Virginia.
   In subsequent years, he served in various capacities in Hawaii
and Philadelphia, California and Washington. He graduated from the
Naval War College in Newport, R.I.
   In 1961, Lyle became deputy director of the newly formed Defense
Supply Agency, now called the Defense Logistics Agency. In 1964, he
was named director, and held that post until retiring from the
service.
   After leaving the Navy, Lyle joined the National Security
Industrial Association. He retired as president in 1977.
   Survivors include a son, Dr. Jerry Manning Lyle of Rockville,
Md., and two grandchildren.

   A sheriff who seized a National Guard
armory when he ran out of space at his century-old jail says he has
agreed to move to the state's suggested compromise site _ a vacant
armory in nearby Holyoke.
   ``The sheriff must have a temporary solution workable with the
state until the new jail site is built in Ludlow. The sheriff has
therefore determined to support the state's decision,'' Richard
McCarthy, spokesman for Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe, said
Wednesday.
   Holyoke Mayor Martin Dunn said city lawyers will oppose the
move, involving a site across from a pre-school and kindergarten.
   ``I think the decision is ridiculous,'' Dunn said. ``I will
fight it as long as it needs to be fought.''
   The tentative agreement worked out between the state and Ashe
was scheduled to go before Hampden County Superior Court Judge
George Keady today.
   National Guard officials said they would wait until an agreement
was final before making any comment.
   Ashe seized a National Guard armory in Springfield on Feb. 16,
saying he had a choice between taking the building or putting more
than a dozen prisoners on the streets.
   After the state tried to evict Ashe, he won a temporary court
order giving him the right to stay at his makeshift jail. Since
then, state and county lawyers have been working on a compromise.
   When Ashe seized the armory, he claimed authority under a 16th
century statute requiring citizens to give ``suitable aid'' to law
enforcement efforts of his office. But state officials contend that
Ashe as a county official does not have authority over state
property.

   William Appleman Williams, a historian who
sharply criticized U.S. foreign policy and asserted that the United
States acted as an imperialist power, has died of cancer at age 68.
   Williams died Monday at Newport Community Hospital. He lived in
the nearby coastal community of Waldport.
   He termed himself a radical and was particularly critical of
America's role in the Cold War and in Vietnam.
   Williams was best known for a series of books written in the
late 1950s and 1960s that challenged prevailing views of American
history. He asserted the United States was an imperialist power,
seeking to impose its economic and ideological will on an unwilling
world.
   He argued that the nation's refusal to acknowledge its
imperialist past led to a skewed national vision that made it
difficult to set a course for the future.
   Critics accused him of employing a double standard, of
explaining Soviet actions by citing national security while
measuring Western actions against a utopian ideal.
   His books, which gave him a reputation as a revisionist
historian, created widespread controversy in academic circles and
influenced a generation of historians.
   His views had entered the mainstream of American thought by the
late 1970s and, in 1980, he was elected president of the
Organization of American Historians.
   ``I think of him as the clearest of the revisionist historians
and the inspirer of a school of younger historians who put the Cold
War into a perspective that they didn't have before,'' said Victor
Navasky, editor of The Nation, the liberal magazine for which
Williams frequently wrote.
   He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin from 1960 to
1968, and at Oregon State University from 1968 to 1986. He also
taught at the University of Melbourne in Australia as a Fulbright
scholar in 1977.
   Williams is survived by his wife, Wendy, three children, two
stepchildren and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   The United States, France and the Vatican
are trying to end a monthlong showdown between rival Christian
forces and help President Elias Hrawi spread his authority to east
Beirut, government sources said today. One Christian source in the
government said the Vatican told renegade army Gen. Michel Aoun and
militia chieftain Samir Geagea that their fighting ``threatens the
Christians' existence in Lebanon.''
   The Vatican's stand was interpreted as ``an indirect threat that
the Holy See would have to accept foreign military intrevention to
quell the armed conflict in the Christian enclave,'' said the
source, who demanded anonymity.
   ``Such a military intervention, most probably by the Syrian
army, would spare neither Aoun nor Geagea,'' the source said.
   Christian troops under Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia
under Geagea fought each other to a standstill before accepting a
cease-fire Saturday.
   More than 750 people were killed and 2,088 wounded during the
inconclusive fighting, which broke out Jan. 30. At least $850
million in public and private property were destroyed.
   The source said the cease-fire was accepted after the Vatican's
stand was relayed last week.
   Syrian-backed Hrawi and Prime Minister Salim Hoss returned to
Beirut late Wednesday from a four-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Algeria
and Morocco.
   Hrawi and Hoss released a statement today saying that the three
Arab nations promised aid to help them ``spread the legitimate
state authority over the whole of Lebanon.''
   Leaders of the three Arab nations make up a mediation committee
that brokered October's peace accord aimed at ending Lebanon's
nearly 15 years of civil war. Hrawi was elected president in
November under the plan. He replaced Aoun who headed a caretaker
government.
   Aoun has refused to recognize Hrawi as head of state and
rejected the peace plan, demanding that it specify a timetable for
the withdrawal of the 40,000 troops Syria maintains in Lebanon.
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar said the United States was
trying to persuade Geagea to withdraw his militia from Christian
east Beirut and France had asked Aoun to step down and hand over
the presidential palace to Hrawi.
   The paper said if Aoun agreed to step down and Geagea withdrew
his militiamen from east Beirut, the U.S. would ``move seriously''
to arrange a withdrawal from Moslem west Beirut of Syrian troops
and their allied Moslem and leftist militiamen.
   A Moslem government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Bush administration has ``repeatedly informed all the
parties to the conflict in Lebanon that it supports the creation of
a greater Beirut free of militias.''
   ``The Americans want a unified Beirut and its suburbs policed by
troops loyal to President Hrawi as the legitimate head of state in
Lebanon,'' said the Moslem source.
   Beirut has been divided into predominately Christian and Moslem
sectors since the civil war broke out in 1975.
   Aoun's refusal to leave the shell-wrecked presidential palace
has forced Hrawi to set up temporary headquarters in Syrian-policed
west Beirut.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Catholic community
that has dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.

<HEAD>Moscow News Critical of Cuban Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare Soviet attack on the Cuban leadership, a
newspaper this week attributed the island's stability to Fidel
Castro's intransigence and reliance on outdated ideas that cause
suffering for the population.
   The weekly edition of the Moscow News, which came out Tuesday,
also said dissension is growing in Cuba and that about 15
opposition groups have formed.
   The article in the weekly, considered a progressive newspaper,
reflects a growing divergence between the Kremlin and Cuba as
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moves to reduce the power of the
Communist Party here and strengthen the government.
   At the same time, Castro has repeatedly said his country will
never embrace the reforms orchestrated by Gorbachev and
increasingly accepted throughout Eastern Europe.
   ``To all appearances, the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe
came as a complete surprise to the Cuban leader,'' Moscow News
said. ``On both economic and political counts, they produced a
shock.''
   It noted that state-run Cuban radio carried editorial attacks on
the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and blamed the
changes on ``weak governments unable to tackle economic turmoil.''
   ``Such categorical judgments are pronounced in an island with
total rationing, which insures people against poverty, but does not
give them the impetus to work,'' Moscow News said.
   It mocked the Cuban leader for his Dec. 7 statement saying, ``if
history will attach to us the role of the last defenders of
socialism in the world _ we will defend this stronghold to the last
drop of blood.''
   The Cuban model that Castro wants to defend is based on a
complete rejection of a market economy, moral principles over
material ones, a militarized state and an untouchable party-state
elite, the newspaper said.
   ``Cuba copied none other but Soviet administrative and economic
structures at the time when European socialism was sinking into the
swamp of stagnation'' based on the ideological dogma of the late
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, it continued.
   Cuba gets about $5 billion in annual aid from the Soviet Union.
   Despite Castro's pledge to defend the party at all costs and
ignore change in the socialist community, Moscow News said reform
is on its way.
   ``About 15 dissident groups have emerged,'' the newspaper said.
``Their demands vary from support for the perestroika process in
the U.S.S.R. to freedom of religious beliefs in Cuba.''
   Until change comes, Moscow News said, the island will remain
stable, but only ``through the efforts of Revolution Defense
Committees embracing the entire country.''

   The leader of a coup attempt against
the Afghan government said today his struggle to overthrow the
Soviet-backed leadership is not over, and he urged the guerrillas
he once opposed to join him in the fight.
   Leaders of the guerrillas' government-in-exile rejected Shah
Nawaz Tanai's call. ``How can we extend our support to a
Communist?'' asked the guerrillas' prime minister.
   The Afghan capital was reported returning to normal today, two
days after Tanai, as defense minister, turned on President Najib
and sent renegade forces to bomb the presidential palace.
   Official Radio Kabul quoted the Interior Ministry today as
saying 56 people died and 200 were injured in the fighting.
Diplomatic sources and guerrilla leaders have said hundreds of
people died or were injured.
   The radio report also said four members of the Supreme Defense
Council had been dismissed, apparently for supporting the coup
attempt.
   Shops and offices opened and people poured into the streets of
Kabul, according to diplomatic and Western sources there. Many
buildings, including the presidential palace, the Finance Ministry
and government-run Radio Kabul, were badly damaged, said the
sources, who all insisted on anonymity.
   Diplomats, guerrilla leaders and U.N. officials in Pakistan said
they still had reports of fighting in southern Kandahar, eastern
Jalalabad and western Shindand, where the country's second-largest
air base is located.
   One Western diplomat said he had reports that pro-Tanai forces
were fighting government troops for control of Kabul airport.
Another said the air force, given much credit for helping Najib's
government survive without Soviet troops, had suffered severe
losses.
   ``A lot of aircraft have been knocked out,'' the diplomat said.
   None of the reports could be independently verified.
   In a message delivered today to the news agency of the
guerrillas' exiled government, Tanai said: ``We have risen up and
our struggle will continue.''
   ``I am inside Afghanistan,'' Tanai said in the 2-minute-long
message, translated by the agency from Dari into English. ``I am
sending this cassette with my friend outside to be broadcast to
you.''
   ``This is a call for Afghanistan's Moslem people and the army
and the real party members. Najib and his dictatorship will fall.
For this and for national unity, we have risen up.''
   The tape was played to reporters, who recognized Tanai's voice
from miltary briefings, news conferences, and television
appearances in Kabul.
   Tanai fled Afghanistan on Wednesday, and Pakistani officials and
guerrilla sources said he then defected to the Moslem guerrillas,
whom he fought more than a decade. Tanai returned to Afghanistan,
but his exact whereabouts were not known.
   Within hours after launching the coup attempt, one of the most
radical guerrilla leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, declared his
support for Tanai.
   Hekmatyar has generally had the support of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf,
leader of the radical Islamic Ittehad guerrilla faction, but Sayyaf
said today the guerrillas would never accept Tanai because of his
ties to the Communist leadership. ``He's no different than Najib,''
said Sayyaf in Peshawar, Pakistan, where the guerrillas are
headquartered.
   Sayyaf is prime minister of the guerrillas' government-in-exile.
   A more moderate guerrilla leader, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, the
exiled government's president, also refused to accept Tanai. ``We
do not have any understanding or solidarity with either (Tanai or
Najib),'' he said.
   Tanai long opposed Najib's efforts to make peace with the Afghan
guerrillas, who took up arms against the government after a
Communist coup in 1978. The Soviet army fought alongside government
troops until February 1989, when they withdrew under a
U.N.-mediated accord. They still supply the government with arms,
while the United States arms the guerrillas.
   Tanaii's alliance with Hekmatyar was one of convenience, not
ideology, for Tanai is a staunch Marxist who favored a hard line
against the guerrillas, while Hekmatyar is one of the most radical
anti-Western rebel leaders.
   An Afghan government spokesman, meanwhile, said Najib had
received ``messages from all provinces ensuring support for the
government.'' The spokesman, Naqib Sameer, spoke in a telephone
interview from London.
   According to Naqib, the coup attempt was plotted by ``a group of
hard-liners, a group who were against national reconciliation
policy and with the full cooperation of extremist groups of
Gulbuddin and (Tanai) himself.''
   Radio Kabul said four members of the Supreme Defense Council had
been dismissed for ``national dishonesty.'' They were identified as
Niaz Mohjammad Momand and Mir Sahib Karwal, both Politburo members;
Gen. Nazar Mohammad, an alternate member of the Politburo; and
Sayed Aqa Aka, a brigadier general who fled to Pakistan on
Wednesday.
   The insurgents said pro-Tanai forces were still in control of
the country's biggest air base, Bagram, where fierce fighting was
reported Wednesday. However, one rebel source said the base had
been destroyed by pro-Najib bombers.

   Hundreds of Moslems today shouted Islamic
slogans and demanded independence for Kashmir as a delegation of
political leaders including former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
arrived to try to end the unrest.
   ``Allah is great!'' the crowds chanted as the convoy of army
jeeps and trucks carrying the delegation drove through the streets
from the airport. ``We want independence!''
   Earlier today, gunfights broke out between the militants and
security forces, and at least two civilians were reported killed.
   Soldiers carrying machine guns and automatic rifles strictly
enforced curfew regulations as the delegation arrived. But hundreds
of residents shouted slogans from the loudspeakers of scores of
mosques in the city.
   The delegation, which included deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal
and representatives from all major political parties, says it is on
a peace mission aimed at ending the Moslem movement for secession
of Kashmir from Hindu-majority India.
   The delegation met with Jammu-Kashmir state Gov. Jagmohan at a
luxury hotel near Dal Lake, which was ringed by at least 1,000
policemen and paramilitary troops. They were not allowed to leave
the hotel.
   ``I am shocked,'' Gandhi told reporters at the hotel. ``If there
is no political solution, I see some very hard options ahead.''
   Gandhi also said he had been refused permission to visit
residents of Srinagar, the largest city in the valley, and the
focal point of the Moslem campaign for secession.
   Jagmohan said allowing Gandhi to go out would create a
``tremendous security risk.''
   When curfew was lifted from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m., almost-continuous
exchanges of fire began, said witnesses who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Moslem snipers fired at paramilitary police at four
places but he had no details of casualties, said Jagmohan, a Hindu
who uses one name.
   The witnesses said they heard firing from at least a half-dozen
areas among the shops, houses and narrow, winding streets of
downtown Srinagar. They said militants were sniping from rooftops
and pinning down soldiers in roadside bunkers. The soldiers
returned fire sporadically, the witnesses said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``It was like a battlefield,'' said one witness contacted by
telephone. ``I've never heard firing like this before.''
   Witnesses reported two killed and 10 wounded.
   The deaths raise to 173 the number of people killed since Jan.
20, when security forces launched a crackdown on militants fighting
for the independence of Kashmir. Jagmohan took charge as the
state's governor Jan. 18 and ordered the crackdown.
   Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, comprises the
Kashmir valley and the plains of Jammu to the south. The valley is
disputed by India and neighboring Pakistan and has been the scene
of a lingering secessionist movement by Moslem militants.
   The campaign for an independent Kashmir has flared in recent
months, with India accusing Pakistan of fomenting the trouble, a
charge that Pakistan repeatedly denies.
   The two countries have gone to war three times since their
independence from Britain in 1947 _ twice over Kashmir. A
U.N-sponsored cease-fire line separates Kashmir into Indian and
Pakistani sectors.
   At least 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems. Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million people
and Hindus make up 82 percent.

   Vietnamese citizens are pressing their
ruling Communist Party to revise a draft document to clearly show a
separation of party and state, the official Vietnam News Agency
said.
   ``All agreed that to rapidly reorganize the party is a task that
cannot be delayed any longer,'' the agency said in a report
released Wednesday on public debates througout the country.
   The party has eased its grip on society in recent years but has
ruled out following the radical changes that are taking place in
Communist parties throughout Eastern Europe.
   The agency said the draft program of an upcoming party meeting
has raised debates throughout the country and ``is drawing the
largest participation of the population of Ho Chi Minh City since
liberation in 1975.''
   The agency quoted an unidentified debater as saying:
   ``The draft should lay more emphasis on the reorganization of
the party itself as the basis to broaden democracy and realize
social equality, strengthen the people's power and the mass
organizations.''
   ``In this connection, it is necessary first of all to separate
the functions of the party from those of the state,'' the debater
said.

<HEAD>Jackie Onassis Ends 10-Year Land Dispute with Wampanoag Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ended a
10-year dispute with a group of Wampanoag Indians by agreeing to
give them a plot of land and $100,000 in exchange for a tiny
beachfront site.
   The case pitted Mrs. Onassis' desire for privacy against the
Indians' belief that they should retain control of tribal lands on
Martha's Vineyard, including 1.5 acres owned primarily by the
Wampanoags that is surrounded by Onassis' estate on the island.
   ``After all this time I'm just happy the land was settled,''
said Thelma Weissberg, one of the 25 descendants of William
Vanderhoop, a Wampanoag who lived in the area in the 1870s and
owned the 1.5-acre plot. ``I've lived on the island all my life and
I'm happy that we have some of our land back.''
   Wampanoags have lived at the picturesque cliffs of Gay Head for
centuries. The tribe believes the tract on Onassis' estate holds
the last resting place of the great chief Moshup and his wife,
Squant.
   In 1980, Mrs. Onassis obtained one-sixth interest in the
1.5-acre plot, and sought to buy the remaining five-sixths from the
25 descendants of Vanderhoop. She wanted to close access to the
parcel and keep beachgoers and tourists away from her 400-acre
property.
   But the Wampanoags resisted and a series of lawsuits and
countersuits followed.
   According to the terms of the agreement signed Wednesday, the
Wampanoags will surrender title and access to the 1.5-acre site in
exchange for $100,000 and a 2-acre beachfront plot closer to the
nearest road.
   Brian Hurley, one of Mrs. Onassis' attorneys, said: ``She's just
pleased to have resolved this long matter and hopes to continue
being good neighbors. She wants to put it behind her.''
   Since 1974, various Wampanoags have regained about 400 acres of
what they consider tribal land on Martha's Vineyard through a
series of federal lawsuits.
   They claimed that a 1790 law that forbids transfer of Indian
lands without federal approval was violated in the 1870s when the
state redistributed tribal lands to other island residents.
   The Wampanoags have maintained a tribal structure for more than
370 years, according to tribal council president Donald Widdiss,
but they did not receive federal recognition until 1987. There are
only 250 Wampanoags left at Gay Head, and only 630 in the nation.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded that
Lithuania pay the Kremlin billions in hard currency if the republic
goes ahead with its plan to secede from the Soviet Union, the
Baltic republic's president says.
   The demand for compensation came in a meeting with Lithuania's
president, Algirdas Brazauskas, ahead of an expected weekend vote
on secession in the republic's parliament.
   Vilnius Radio put the figure at $34 billion, saying the money
would cover investments Moscow has made in Lithuania since forcibly
annexing it in 1940. Lithuanian nationalists say the Kremlin has it
backward, and should pay them for a half-century of exploitation.
   Brazauskas, who also heads the republic's breakaway Communist
Party, told Lithuanian television Wednesday night that there was no
need ``to frighten ourselves and others'' about the economic
consequences of secession.
   In a Tass report on the interview, Brazauskas said Gorbachev
told him during the meeting Monday that if Lithuania proclaims
independence, ``economic relations would have to be legalized as
relations between two independent states, and accounts between them
will have to be settled in freely convertible currency.''
   The Soviet ruble is not convertible, meaning its value is set by
the government rather than through trading on world markets.
   The official Soviet news agency quoted Brazauskas as saying that
to pay in convertible currency ``would be an extremely difficult
task for the republic to accomplish,'' since it imports fuel,
metallurgical products, and raw materials from the Soviet Union at
about three times lower than world prices.
   Brazauskas said the republic would nevertheless be so much
better off on its own that the advantages would offset its debt to
Moscow, according to Eduardas Potashinskas, an editor at Lithuanian
TV.
   Brazauskas said Gorbachev indicated the Soviet Union may demand
Lithuania turn over the port of Klaipeda if allowed to secede, as
well as a small section around Drushinikai in extreme south
Lithuania, according to the editor.
   Potashinskas said the Lithuanians could make counterclaims for
the areas around Oshmyany and Novogrudok that were parts of
Lithuania after Lenin signed a treaty recognizing the republic's
independence in 1920.
   Klaipeda, a warm-water port on the Baltic Sea 125 miles
northwest of Vilnius, was occupied by the Germans and later freed
by Soviet forces in 1944.
   Solid victories in recent elections have given backers of
Sajudis, the pro-independence popular movement, control of
Lithuania's Parliament. As a result, the group's leaders have
decided to force the issue of secession.
   The Parliament, in a session called for this weekend, is sure
``to come out with some form of declaration of independence,'' said
Potashinskas, who also is a Sajudis activist.
   Pro-secession sentiment in the republic of 3.8 million has been
swelling for months. But Sajudis decided to move now to pre-empt
Gorbachev's plans to introduce a vastly more powerful presidency
with the right to crack down on restive republics. The national
Congress of People's Deputies is scheduled to meet Monday to
consider the presidency proposal.
   ``Why so fast? I think Gorbachev himself created such a
reaction,'' said Audris Siaurusavicius, a reporter for Rebirth, the
Sajudis newspaper.
   ``If there were no such proposal on the presidency, we wouldn't
have done this now.''
   All three Baltic republics, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, were
independent nations between the World Wars before being forced to
join the Soviet Union in 1940 while under Soviet occupation.
   Lawmakers in Moscow are considering a proposed law that would
give republics the right to secede from the union. But settling
financial issues is just one of a daunting series of requirements
that the republics would have to meet in order to secede.
   The proposed law also says a republic can secede only after a
republic-wide referendum in which three-fourths of the adults vote
in favor of the move; then the secession proposal must be submitted
to national lawmakers in Moscow.
   During a minimum five-year transition phase, defense, security
and border questions are to be settled and the government of the
seceding republic must also settle financial and property issues.
   The Soviet Constitution guarantees republics the right to
secede, but the procedure never has been spelled out in Soviet law.
   Siaurusavicius said Sajudis leaders were expecting Moscow's
response to the declaration to be restrained. But he said the
republic could already feel the effects of a mounting Soviet
economic blockade. Many factories are running short on raw
materials and they expect the situation to get worse.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly denounced ``separatists'' and has asked
activists to give Moscow time to work out the terms of a new Soviet
federation before moving to secede.
   An article in the government newspaper Izvestia on Wednesday
complained that ``Lithuania is getting public opinion used to the
fact that it `is leaving,''' without thinking through all the
economic and political difficulties secession would create.
   The article said such problems would include trade imbalances,
the difficulty of deciding what to do about various Soviet-built
factories and the fate of Lithuanian residents who want to retain
their Soviet citizenship.
   Moreover, it said, the Lithuanian push for independence had
spread to other republics. ``One after another, legislative
measures are passed which, like a lancet, cut off vein after vein,
nerve after nerve from the overall organism,'' the article said.
   About half of the Soviet Union's 15 republics now have popular
groups pushing for independence or greater sovereignty, including
Moldavia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia.

   Democrats pushed their version of a campaign
financing bill through the Senate Rules Committee today but
acknowledged it is subject to wholesale change if a compromise can
be struck with Republicans.
   ``I expect that the leadership will propose a comprehensive
substitute amendment to what we passed,'' the panel's chairman,
Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said of the Democratic proposal that
would impose voluntary spending caps ranging from $1.6 billion to
$9.2 billion on individual Senate candidates.
   The committee approved the bill on a 7-3 party-line vote.
Republicans supported a bipartisan advisory panel's call to limit
how much candidates can raise from political action committees
(PACs) and out-of-state donors but place no limit on in-state
contributions from inidviudals.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, called the recommendations Wednesday
from the panel of six experts appointed by Senate Demnocratic
Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Republican Leader Bob Dole a
``genius solution.''
   Republicans plan to begin work next week on a bill based on the
panel's recommendations but said they will add a provision to
address unreported ``soft money'' contributions by non-party
interest groups, such as labor unions, corporations and non-profit
organizations.
   The panel endorsed individual candidate spending ceilings sought
by Democrats, but with ``reasonably high'' and flexible limits and
a provision that would let the GOP keep using its advantage in
raising money through mass direct mailings.
   Under the panel's plan, individual candidates could exceed the
limits through an exemption for limited donations from in-state
residents and still qualify for the discount mail and television
advertising rates intended to lure compliance.
   ``The fact that it embraces a concept of spending limits is an
especially encouraging sign that there is bipartisan momentum
building for real reform,'' said Boren.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the leading Senate critic of
campaign ceilings, said the panel's report can serve as a framework
for further talks. But he said he was ``confused'' by Democrats'
insistence on advancing their bill in the meantime.
   Others, however, were highly critical of the panel's
recommendations, including its acceptance of political action
committees, or PACs, and so-called unreported ``soft'' money
contributions.
   Fred Wertheimer of Common Cause called the package
``fundamentally flawed.''
   ``No serious reform of the congressional campaign finance system
is possible unless the role and influence of PAC money is
dramatically reduced and the soft money system has brought back
Watergate-size and Watergate-style contributions into federal
campaigns is shut down,'' Wertheimer said.
   The experts _ three each picked by Mitchell and Dole _ supported
Republican desires for unfettered party spending on phone banks,
voter registration and direct mail campaigns and higher limits on
individual contributions.
   The report recommended a compromise on PACs, opposing President
Bush's call for an outright ban on corporate and union PACs that
have overwhelmingly favored Democratic incumbents. Instead, it
recommended diminishing their role.
   PACs could contribute only up to one-third of a candidate's
spending limit under the panel's proposals. From then on their
contributions to each candidate would be limited to half the
current $10,000 limit for primary and general election campaigns
together.
   The panel also would ban PACs from making post-election
contributions to retire a candidate's campaign debt and restrict
labor and corporate PACs in ``bundling'' or gathering donations on
behalf of a candidate.
   However, it found ``little obvious cause for concern'' in
bundling done by individuals, such as the more than $200,000 raised
in campaign gifts raised by Phoenix savings and loan executive
Charles H. Keating Jr. for five U.S. senators.
   Other campaign financing abuses raised by last year's S&amp;L crisis
also were ignored by the panel, including the use of so-called
leadership PACS by senior party officials to raise money for other
candidates.
   It also had no recommendation on tax-exempt foundations. Of the
$1.3 million Keating contributed to five Senate candidates,
$850,000 was through a tax-exempt voter registration foundation
headed by the son of Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.

   In a darkened ceremonial hall, President
Bush watched as new streamers were attached today to the four flags
of the U.S. military services to commemorate the invasion of Panama
that toppled dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We're here today to add another campaign streamer to the roll
call of glory, the roster of great American campaigns _ Yorktown,
Gettysburg, Normandy and now Panama,'' said Bush.
   He reaffirmed his support for overturning a Supreme Court
decision that struck down laws making it illegal to burn the flag.
   The flag honors those ``who died in the defense of liberty ...
and that is why I am determined that the American flag will be
consecrated, not desecrated,'' said Bush.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said, ``With the presentation of these streamers, the campaign in
Panama is now part of the glorious tradition of our nation and its
armed forces.
   ``For as long as the Stars and Stripes flies over this nation,
the actions of the men and women who helped to restore democracy to
Panama in December of 1989 will be remembered,'' said Powell.
   The flags borne by an honor guard from the Army, the Navy, the
Air Force and the Marines already carry dozens of multicolored
streamers, each signifying a different war or engagement, from the
Revolutionary War to the Civil War to Vietnam and Grenada.
   ``On the surface the streamer is but a piece of multicolored
cloth. But for every American and especially for those of us who
wore a uniform in December of 1989, it will always represent
unselfish sacrifice,'' said Powell.
   Bush reviewed the troops arrayed in Ceremonial Hall at this base
just across the Potomac River from the capital. More than 200
soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines stood at attention, some
bearing bayonets, others rifles and still others carrying flags
from each state and territory.
   ``The people of that nation, Panama, needed us to stand with
them to defend that struggle for democracy and for the opportunity
that Americans have enjoyed for over 200 years,'' said Bush.
   He said that ``27,000 of America's finest sprang into action''
for the Dec. 20 operation that the Pentagon called Just Cause.
   The expeditionary streamer was the 169th affixed to the Army
flag; the 13th for the Marine flag; the 19th for the Navy and the
78th for the Air Force.
   Bush said the streamer is ``most of all'' for the 23 soldiers
killed in the Panama operation.

   Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty
for a man convicted of a murder that was cited in a letter that
claimed responsibility for the mail bomb killings of a judge and
civil rights lawyer.
   Jurors deliberated eight hours Wednesday before convicting
Emmanuel Hammond shortly before midnight of murder, kidnapping and
armed robbery.
   Hammond, 24, of Marietta hung his head and rubbed his eyes as
the verdict was read.
   Fulton Superior Court Judge Ralph H. Hicks scheduled the
sentencing portion of Hammond's trial to begin today.
   Julie Love, a 27-year-old preschool fitness teacher who
disappeared in July 1988, was the subject of a much-publicized
search until her body was found in August. She had been shot in the
head.
   Hammond was handcuffed in the courtroom and led away as Miss
Love's family embraced. Her father, Jerry Love, rfused to comment
``until it's all over.''
   Fulton County Assistant District Attorneys William L. Hawthorne
III and Richard Hicks shook hands after the trial.
   ``I am obviously very pleased,'' Hawthorne said.
   ``I think the jury worked long and hard in their deliberations,
and they apparently had some basis for their verdict,'' said
defense attorney William A. Wehunt.
   Wehunt contended Hammond's chief accusers _ his former
girlfriend, Janice Weldon, and his cousin, Maurice Porter _
actually killed Miss Love and were trying to frame his client.
   Porter has pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and rape in
the death of Miss Love and awaits sentencing. He testified last
week that Hammond abducted Miss Love from an Atlanta street after
her car ran out of gas and that Hammond dragged her into some
bushes and killed her.
   Miss Weldon, who led police to Miss Love's body, also testified
against Hammond.
   Testimony in the trial began last week under heavy security
because of concern over the possible link to the pre-Christmas mail
bombs. A death threat from a group called the Aryan Resistance
Movement, apparently unrelated to the bombings, later led to even
tighter security.
   A letter from a group claiming responsibility for the mail bomb
deaths of Judge Robert Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson said the attacks were
motivated by outrage over Miss Love's killing.
   The letter, signed by Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System, threatened more violence if any other white women were
attacked by black men in Alabama, Florida or Georgia. Miss Love was
white. Hammond is black.

   Former President Richard M. Nixon returned
today to the House of Representatives, where his political career
started, in the role of political educator lecturing lawmakers
about the world and the changes taking place.
   ``An extraordinary session,'' House minority leader Bob Michel,
R-Ill., said after the closed-door meeting. ``An extraordinary tour
de force,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 man in
the House Republican hierarchy.
   Nixon said he told the congressmen that while the Cold War is
probably over in Europe, ``it is still going on in the Third
World.'' He said any ``peace benefit'' coming from the reduction of
tensions should go toward reducing this country's huge deficit.
   ``What really went through my mind was that here is where it all
began,'' said Nixon, who entered the political world as a freshman
congressman in 1948. He recalled that his office was a couple of
doors down from that of another freshman congressman, John F.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``The two of us who disagreed politically and later, on some
very big issues, agreed on foreign policy and our first vote was
for President Truman's request for military and economic aid to
Greece and Turkey,'' Nixon said. ``It was a good vote and it
started the bipartisan policy which I hope can be reinitiated
today.''
   There was no mention that the House of Representatives was
prepared to vote Nixon's impeachment in 1974 when he resigned the
highest office in the land.
   Nixon spent more than an hour with Republican congressmen,
speaking of global changes. Later, he went to the Senate side of
the Capitol, to the office of Minority Leader Bob Dole, to meet
with 18 incumbent GOP senators who are up for re-election this year.
   The former president was in good humor as he talked with
reporters, saying ``as I look at this crowd, I know I'm getting
older but the press seems to be getting younger.''
   He suggested that a change could come in Cuba if Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cuts off the $6 billion in aid it
gives each year to that country.
   ``The key is Gorbachev,'' said Nixon.
   At that point, a reporter addressed Nixon as ``Mr. Gorbachev.''
   When the laughter died down, Nixon said, ``I've been called
worse.''
   The former president reminisced that in his days as a
congressman and senator, when the Cold War began, the chief goal of
the United States was to defeat communism. Now, he said, the
greatest responsibility is to see that freedom works.
   The 77-year-old Nixon has become more visible in recent months
through his visit to China, a dinner with President Bush to discuss
that trip, and his effort to help Bush convince the Senate to
sustain a veto.
   Nixon's briefings were one more step in his increasing political
acceptance.
   The former president was invited by the Congressional Institute
Inc., an organization founded three years ago by House Republicans.
The institute organizes retreats and events for members; a
spokesman said this is the first time it has attracted a speaker of
Nixon's renown.
   Nixon has written extensively, in books and in magazine and
newspaper articles, about foreign affairs in recent years and is
sought after as a speaker on global politics.
   His latest book, ``In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, Defeat and
Renewal,'' is to be published next month. Its profits will go to
the Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace Foundation, which
built the Nixon library in Yorba Linda, Calif. The library is to be
opened in July.
   Nixon made his sixth trip to China in November and, in private
talks with top Chinese leaders, expressed American concern over
political repression in that country. He was the most prominent
American to go to China since the bloody military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last June.
   On his return, the 37th president had dinner with Bush, the 41st
president. Bush found the talk ``interesting,'' according to press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   In January, Nixon made at least two telephone calls to
Republican senators asking them to sustain Bush's veto of a bill
protecting Chinese students from deportation. The Senate failed to
override the veto.

<HEAD>Official Discloses Plan for Jewish Housing In Arab Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A planning official disclosed today that the
government has plans to build a new Jewish neighborhood in Arab
east Jerusalem, despite a dispute with the United States over new
construction in the area.
   Ruth Kaminker, a member of Jerusalem's nine-member City Planning
Board, told The Associated Press that the new 225-acre neighborhood
was in ``final stages'' of planning after a three-month study of
the site.
   The development, estimated to include up to 3,000 homes or
apartments, is planned for a steep slope of a hill known as Mt.
Homa, said Mrs. Kaminker, a member of the left-wing Citizens'
Rights Movement.
   She said the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
requested development of the Jewish neighborhood, apparently in an
attempt to strengthen the Jewish hold in the Arab sector of
Jerusalem, which was captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   City spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer denied any new neighborhood in
east Jerusalem was in the planning stages. But she acknowledged the
site was one of several under consideration in east Jerusalem for
construction of Jewish housing.
   Israel has been under growing U.S. pressures to give the 140,000
Palestinians of east Jerusalem a role in Middle East peace talks,
but Shamir has objected, saying such a move could harm Israel's
claim to all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital.
   Last week, President Bush criticized Israeli building in
disputed areas of Jerusalem. ``We do not believe there should be
new settlements in the West Bank or east Jerusalem,'' Bush told
reporters in California.
   Unlike settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, new housing
projects in east Jerusalem are generally referred to here as
neighborhoods, because people who move into them do not get special
benefits such as low-interest mortgages available in the occupied
territories.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967, but most countries
including the United States, have not recognized Israeli
sovereignty over the area.
   In response to Baker's remark, Jerusalem's city council held an
emergency meeting Tuesday and adopted a resolution to ``continue to
build the city for the good of all its inhabitants.''
   In the past 23 years, Israel has moved 120,000 Jews into the
annexed Arab area of the city. A total of 350,000 Jews live in east
and west Jerusalem.
   Mrs. Kaminker said the new neighborhood would be alongside Zur
Baher, an Arab neighborhood of several thousand people, and would
in effect complete a Jewish ring around the city.
   But Mrs. Kaminker said plans for the new Jewish neighborhood
were nearly complete, requiring only official approval that would
be a ``foregone conclusion'' since the government asked for the
neighborhood.
   Efforts at Arab-Israeli reconciliation have several times been
stalled by housing built on confiscated Arab land. But Mrs.
Kaminker said the current site already was state-owned, purchased
by the Jewish National Fund from Arab landowners and then sold to
Israel.
   The land had long been earmarked for tree-planting and banned
for construction because of its rocky terrain, Mrs. Kaminker said.
``It is a very difficult area for construction, so the decision
seems purely political,'' she added.
   Mrs. Kaminker said her party would protest implementation of the
housing project. But the Citizens' Rights movement is a tiny
minority on the city council dominated by Shamir's Likud bloc, the
center-left Labor Party and conservative religious parties.

   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
will visit the White House April 17 to discuss Central American
peace efforts and other matters with President Bush, the White
House said today.
   Callejas accepted an invitation from Bush to pay a working visit
to the United States April 17-19, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``They will meet on April 17. They will discuss issues of
interest concerning the regional peace process, economic assistance
and President Callejas' economic reform program,'' he said.
   For years, Honduras provided a base of operations for Contra
rebels seeking to oust the Sandinista government in neighboring
Nicaragua. Callejas has called upon the Contras to lay down their
arms and return home following Sandinista President Daniel Ortega's
loss to Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua's Feb. 25 elections.
   Vice President Dan Quayle visited Honduras in late January.

<HEAD>Two Families Found Shot to Death in Northeast Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two families have been found shot to death
within hours of each in separate northeast Ohio cities and
authorities suspect both were murder-suicides by the fathers.
   Police investigating the whereabouts of one family found all
five dead Wednesday in their apartment in Mayfield Heights, about
10 miles east of Cleveland. Police think Robert W. Lynch, 52, shot
his pregnant wife and their three children and then shot himself.
   About 4{ hours later, a family of four was found in their
apartment in Painesville, about 30 miles northeast of Cleveland.
Police said Bruce Clinton, 36, shot his estranged wife and two
children and then killed himself.
   The bodies of Clinton, his wife, Angela M. Green, 23, and their
two children, Wesley Adam, 5, and Winston Allen, 14 months, were
discovered in the apartment shortly after officers were called
Wednesday evening, police Lt. Charles Howard said.
   ``They hadn't been heard of for several hours, and friends of
the family hadn't been able to locate occupants by phone or in
person,'' Howard said.
   He said all four died of gunshot wounds to the head.
   ``Further investigation disclosed Clinton shot his wife and two
children and then took his own life,'' Howard said.
   Lynch was found on a sofa in his living room, police said. The
bodies of his pregnant wife, Joy M. Lynch, 44, and their sons
Michael R., 16, Matthew D., 14, and Andrew S., 11, were found in
their beds. All were shot either in the head or upper body.
   ``We have never had anything comparable to this. It's the
biggest murder we've ever had,'' said Police Chief Dominic Caprara.
   ``She was just about ready to have her child any time and she
seemed very happy,'' said apartment manager Frances Griffith.
   Police discovered two semiautomatic pistols in the apartment,
along with several spent shells and a note believed left by Lynch.
   Police said the note contained the sentence: ``This is the last
straw.''
   ``The investigation isn't complete, but we believe the father
may have been the one who shot the mother and three kids and
committed suicide,'' said police Sgt. Larry McHugh.
   ``The man had been despondent over a number of things,''
including recent business setbacks, police Sgt. Harold DeBoe said
today. He would not elaborate.
   Police entered the apartment with a building manager after a
neighbor expressed concern that the Lynch boys had all missed
school. The neighbor later told police she thought she heard shots
early in the morning.

<HEAD>Florida Atlantic University Offers Free Tuition to Black Freshmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Atlantic University this fall
will become the state's only public university offering free
tuition to every black freshman who meets admissions standards,
school officials said.
   The gesture, which the United Negro College Fund said was
probably the only such program in the nation, is intended to boost
the number of black students at the school in Boca Raton.
   ``Sometimes you spend too much time talking about why you should
do something and not enough time doing it,'' FAU President Anthony
Catanese said Tuesday. ``If you're serious about recruiting the
best students, a full scholarship simply is the way to go.''
   There also is a practical motive: The Board of Regents has
ordered FAU to increase its freshman class by 50 percent next year,
and the number of black students must go up to meet state targets
for minority enrollment.
   ``It's a phenomenal idea, an excellent first step,'' said
Maurice Hall, president of the West Palm Beach branch of the NAACP.
   Both Floridians and out-of-state students can apply, but
in-state students will get preference under the program, which will
be financed through private donations and school funds.
   FAU has 608 black students _ including foreign students _ out of
a total student body of 11,310.
   But this year's freshman class had only 28 black students. That
meets the Board of Regents' target for blacks, who must account for
at least 7.7 percent of the student body. But it is smaller than
the proportion of blacks in surrounding Broward and Palm Beach
counties: 11.2 percent and 13.5 percent.
   ``The targets are far too low for this area,'' said Brian
Levin-Stankevich, admissions director. ``It should be obvious to
anybody that 28 black (freshmen) students are not enough.''
   ``What bothers me is that the goals are rather modest. I want to
redouble the efforts,'' Catanese said.
   University officials emphasized that boosting the number of
blacks will not require cutting the number of non-black students,
because freshman enrollment is being expanded so dramatically.
   ``We're not displacing anybody by adding minorities,''
Levin-Stankevich said. ``I think that's an important point.''
   Enough scholarship money already is earmarked to pay full
tuition costs for 30 black freshmen. Every black freshman this year
has a scholarship. Financial aid officials estimate that tuition
will be $1,350 a student next year.
   FAU would be the only university in the nation to guarantee full
scholarships to each black freshman, the United Negro College Fund
says. Private Lemoyne-Owens College in Memphis launched a program
this year to give free tuition to inner-city black male high school
students who stay off drugs.
   The school also set up a dual-degree program last week with
predominantly black Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach,
allowing students there to transfer to FAU to earn an engineering
diploma _ again with a full scholarship. Similar partnerships are
being pursued with Florida Memorial College in Miami and Edward
Waters College in Jacksonville.

<HEAD>Johns Hopkins To Study Heart Disease In Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first major study of women and heart
disease is being undertaken by the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institution and six other centers, after decades of research
devoted solely to male heart disease.
   The $10 million, four-year study is designed to determine
whether three different hormones can help reduce heart disease in
post-menopausal women. Heart disease kills more Americans than any
other disease.
   In the study, 840 women will be assigned at random to one of the
three medications or to a placebo. High blood cholesterol,
hypertension and heightened levels of a blood-clotting factor will
be studied.
   The results could prompt doctors to prescribe hormone therapy
for post-menopausal women, said Dr. Trudy Bush, an epidemiologist
at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.
   ``In my opinion, there is good evidence at this time that women
who use estrogens probably have about half the risk of heart
disease compared to women who don't,'' Bush said. Estrogen hormones
will be part of the study.
   Bush is heading the study at Hopkins along with gynecologists
Dr. David Foster and Dr. Howard Zacur.
   In the past, major studies of heart disease in the United States
have involved males because the ailment tends to strike men at a
younger age than women, and younger people are less likely to
suffer from additional health problems that could complicate a
study.
   The new study, called Post-Menopausal Estrogen and Progestin
Intervention, reflects a belief that women have been denied equal
time in health studies, as well as a growing emphasis on the health
of older people.
   Underlying the study is the belief that estrogen, a hormone
needed for normal female sexual development, protects younger women
against heart disease. Researchers also suspect the threat of a
heart attack increases during menopause when estrogen production
drops off.
   The study will try to determine whether hormone drugs take the
place of natural estrogen in protecting the hearts of older women.

   The House ethics committee said today it will
not pursue an investigation of Republican Whip New Gingrich, but
criticized him for failing to disclose a house purchase and for
improper activities by his staff.
   ``No adequate basis exists'' to begin even the preliminary phase
of an investigation, the committee said in a report approved
unanimously Wednesday and made public today.
   Gingrich said the committee's decision demonstrated that the
charges were ``politically inspired nonsense.''
   The panel said it decided that allegations in separate
complaints last year by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark. _ even if true
_ did not ``state violations of applicable standards of conduct''
by the Georgia Republican.
   Gingrich, however, was ordered to amend his financial disclosure
forms to ``reflect participation'' in his purchase, along with his
daughter, of her personal residence in Georgia four years ago.
   The committee also criticized two letters sent on Gingrich's
official letterhead in December 1986 and January 1987, promoting a
for-profit senior citizens cruise sponsored by Marathon Travel Co.
of Marathon, Fla.
   The panel wrote Gingrich, ``You were remiss in your oversight
and administration of your congressional office'' in the cruise
mailings.
   ``Accordingly, you are directed to immediately take steps to
preclude recurrence of the type of improper activity here involved.
You are further placed on notice that a future recurrence of
improper use of mail and resources may result in more severe
committee action.''
   The outcome of the case was eagerly awaited on Capitol Hill,
because Gingrich, the No. 2-ranking House Republican, was the chief
accuser in the ethics investigation that led to the resignation
last June of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   ``This process of responding to a clearly political smear cost a
lot of money and was very demanding both politically and
personally,'' Gingrich said, contending that the investigation cost
the taxpayers at least $300,000 and himself more than $100,000 in
legal fees.
   Gingrich said his failure to report that he co-signed the
mortgage for his daughter's home stemmed from his misreading of
House rules. And he blamed the travel-promotion letters on a
staffer _ ``a young man who made a mistake in judgment.''
   In a letter to Gingrich attached to the report, the committee
said the joint purchase of his daughter's home ``as well as the
underlying liability you incurred, should have been reported on
your financial disclosure statements.''
   The panel said it considered Gingrich's contention that he was
only a guarantor of the loan and signed documents only as an
accommodation for his daughter.
   ``Nonetheless, the committee believes that the true nature of
the transaction, as reflected in the pertinent legal documents,
should control reporting. Accordingly, pursuant to ... the Ethics
in Government Act of 1978, the committee directs that you promptly
amend your financial disclosure statements to reflect the
transaction in question.'
   The panel also rejected Gingrich's assertion that he had no
personal knowledge of the cruise letters until Alexander filed his
complaint.
   The committee said each member is responsible for the conduct of
his staff and that members cannot use official stationery or other
resources for non-governmental purposes.
   Alexander had alleged that Gingrich committed hundreds of
violations of House rules, including financial disclosure
requirements, and also ran afoul of campaign finance laws. He filed
the ethics complaints last April and October.
   Alexander said Wednesday: ``The ethics committee has resolved
the Gingrich matter by deciding not to investigate further, but by
deciding to admonish Gingrich.''
   ``Further disciplinary actions against Mr. Gingrich are
therefore not needed at the present time,'' Alexander said.
   In his ethics complaint filed in October, Alexander said
Gingrich failed to list the Fulton County, Ga., home as an asset or
the mortgage as a liability.
   The complaint said the home was bought in 1986 and the mortgage
totaled $77,800.
   House rules exempt members from disclosing financial information
about their own homes, but Gingrich acknowledged last year the
residence was for his daughter.
   Gingrich said then he was ``incensed that the fact that I helped
my daughter by co-signing, or signing the note, or whatever one
calls it, gets drug out and becomes a story.''
   He said Alexander's decision to include his daughter's mortgage
in the complaint ``carries politics in the House to a new low
level. I mean it just strikes me as madness.''
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as the ethics
panel is formally known, never voted to hold an investigation of
Gingrich, an outspoken conservative. But it took the unusual step
of hiring a Chicago law firm to advise members on whether to
proceed with the case.
   Late last year, the firm _ the same one that investigated Wright
for the committee _ reportedly recommended that the panel not
proceed against Gingrich.
   Alexander's original complaint in April 1989 focused on a
limited partnership Gingrich created in 1984 to promote ``Window of
Opportunity,'' a book written by the lawmaker, his wife and a third
author.
   The ``COS Limited Partnership'' was made up of 21 individuals
who each put up $5,000 to promote the book. Gingrich was not an
investor, but his wife was paid more than $10,000 for running the
business.
   The complaint contended the $105,000 raised by the partnership
could be considered income to Gingrich, in violation of House
limits on members' outside earnings. Or, it said, it could
constitute a gift to Gingrich, in violation of a rule prohibiting
members from accepting substantial gifts from anyone with a direct
interest in legislation.
   The second complaint, filed in October, charged Gingrich with a
long list of campaign finance and financial disclosure violations.

<HEAD>14 Prisoners Escape from California Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen prisoners used hacksaws on
window bars to escape from a jail section reserved for serious
felony offenders, and 12 remained free this morning, authorities
said.
   The South Bay Detention Facility inmates sawed their way through
the bars Wednesday night, kicked out the plexiglass window and
lowered themselves 30 to 40 feet to the ground on a rope made of
knotted bed sheets, sheriff's Sgt. Jim Cooke said.
   The prisoners climbed up a brush-covered slope and scattered
despite perimeter guards and remote security cameras, Cooke said.
   Sheriff's deputies said jail officials did not know how the
inmates got the hacksaws.
   One inmate was captured minutes later hiding in the back of a
pickup truck heading out of the area, said sheriff's Sgt. Roy
Stamper. A second inmate was picked up by police while walking
along a street near the jail.
   Police stopped and searched a trolley headed for the
U.S.-Mexican border, but found no fugitives on board. Other
officers chased handfuls of fugitives through the dark hills to the
east of the jail, normally the scene of thousands of crossings
nightly by undocumented aliens.
   The escaped inmates were wearing jail-issue blue pullover shirts
and blue pants each bearing the stencil ``SD Jail,'' or were
wearing pale green unmarked T-shirts.
   In early December, seven inmates slipped out of the same jail
through a six-inch slatted window after greasing their bodies with
lotion and climbing the 40 feet on a rope made of sheets. Five are
still free.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is urging ``vigorous action''
to shut down a plant in Libya believed to be producing chemical
weapons. A West German official said quantities produced so far are
small but enough to cause concern.
   Marlin Fitzwater, chief spokesman for President Bush, said that
a plant located at Rabta, about 60 miles south of Tripoli,
apparently is producing poison gas.
   U.S. officials said the plant was making limited quantities of
mustard gas and nerve agents.
   ``Rabta is dangerous and becoming more so,'' Fitzwater said
Wednesday. ``This points to the necessity for heightened
international vigilance of Libyan procurement activities and for
vigorous efforts to stop the operation of Rabta.''
   In Bonn, Norbert Gansel, a lawmaker from the opposition Social
Democratic Party, said today West Germany also has evidence the
plant has begun making deadly gas in small quantities but enough to
cause concern.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has proposed that the
European Economic Community seek international inspections of the
factory.
   Washington has replied by saying it wants the plant closed for
good, a West German government source said.
   ``The Bush administration wants to dismantle the factory, but
with our diplomatic means we don't have the possibility to do
that,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anomyity.
   Another West German government official said Genscher has
proposed that the EEC ask North African nations to bring pressure
for international inspections on short notice. Officials said
Washington has not rejected the initiative.
   Fitzwater, asked today to predict the life expectancy of Rabta,
said, ``We hope two nanoseconds.'' A nanosecond is one billionth of
a second.
   Fitzwater refused to exclude the possibility of a military
strike to knock out the plant. ``We don't rule out anything,'' he
said.
   However, Fitzwater also suggested the plant could be closed if
foreign suppliers denied it the raw materials needed to produce
chemical weapons.
   ``The international community should step up its efforts to deny
Libya the ability to continue operating the plant,'' he said.
   Chemical weapons are relatively cheap to produce and hard to
detect. Libya is one of about two dozen countries considered
capable of or actually producing poison gas.
   The latest U.S. charges underscore the hostile relationship
between the United States and Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
Tensions reached a crisis point in 1986 when the Reagan
administration ordered that Tripoli be bombed.
   Fitzwater, asked what he meant by ``vigorous action,'' said,
``We aren't willing to speculate on what specific efforts, but
nothing is ruled out.''
   He would not comment on the type or quantity of weapons being
produced.
   ``Any amount is a major threat,'' he said.
   Gadhafi's regime has ``a history of terrorism activities and a
history of erratic military behavior,'' Fitzwater said. ``And
therefore, that is the most immediate threat.''
   In 1988, the United States raised concerns about Rabta and
persuaded West German companies and other foreign suppliers to stop
providing technical assistance. U.S. officials said then that Libya
had stopped work on Rabta before reaching full production but
maintained an assembly line.
   Fitzwater said production resumed recently, and West German
politicians have said that Libya had produced enough gas for 1,000
artillery shells.
   Fitzwater declined to discuss which countries were supplying
chemicals to Libya.
   ``We certainly would urge all countries to survey their internal
situation, inventory their chemical production facilities and to
make their own judgments that they are not a source for any of
these chemicals.
   ``We don't really know how the chemicals are getting there or
where they are coming from,'' Fitzwater said. ``But there are so
many routes, again I urge you not to focus on who's giving them
chemicals, but to focus on Mr. Gadhafi and Libya.''
   Gadhafi, who has steadfastly denied Libya was producing chemical
weapons, says the plant was designed to produce pharmaceutical
drugs.
   JANA, the Libyan news agency, said in a dispatch that an unnamed
official source at the Libyan foreign ministry ``disclaimed''
reports that Libya has produced ``quantities of chemical weapons in
(the) Rabta medicine factory.''
   The source, according to JANA, contended that ``such allegations
aired at present by some media circles aim at creating a state of
suspicion'' in light of efforts by Libya and other Arab-African
nations toward economic and political unity.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
met today with the NATO allies and said he reassured them that
their concerns will be considered in the drive to reunify the two
Germanys.
   ``Nobody has to be concerned that the Germans would one way or
the other want to go it alone,'' he told reporters after a nearly
three-hour meeting at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
headquarters.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former German defense
minister, described the talks as ``very intensive, constructive,
fruitful and lively.'' He said the visit opened a formal series of
consultations within NATO on German unification and related
security issues. It will be synchronized with talks between the two
Germanys and the four victorious World War II powers _ Britain,
France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Kohl met first with Woerner and then with the ambassadors of the
16 alliance nations.
   ``What is happening in Germany at present must be embedded in
the overall developments, the ongoing developments in Europe,'' he
said at a news conference afterward.
   ``German interests must be taken into account,'' he said, ``but
also the interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in
East and West must be taken into account.''
   ``This means we need to have talks constantly, that we need to
consult very closely and that we need to cooperate very closely,''
he said. ``That was the idea behind my visit. We shall pursue this
practice of talking with one another at all necessary and possible
levels.''
   The trip was apparently prompted by complaints from smaller
countries in the Atlantic alliance about having no say in
discussions on the future of the two Germanys and how a new state
would fit into the Western military alliance.
   One NATO official described the visit as ``damage limitation.''
   ``He's going to be moaned to by the little guys ... He's coming
here because people have been complaining quite loudly,'' he said
before the talks began.
   The decision of the World War II Allies to meet separately to
discuss German unity has angered officials in Italy, Belgium and
the Netherlands.
   Under the ``two-plus-four'' process, the two German states also
will gather after March 18 elections in East Germany to discuss
their future.
   Western officials have repeatedly stressed that the unified
state must remain in NATO, but Soviet officials have insisted it be
neutral.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev reiterated on Tuesday
opposition to NATO membership for the new German state. ``We cannot
agree to that. It is absolutely out of the question,'' he said,
according to the Tass news agency.
   East Germany is a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, and more
than 380,000 Soviet troops are stationed on its soil.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany has
proposed a formula that would keep the future state in NATO but
only the territory of West Germany would be tied to its military
structure.
   NATO troops would not extend into East Germany.
   NATO officials have previously said Soviet troops could
temporarily remain on the territory of what is now East Germany.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today adopted a resolution
calling for a united Germany to honor Poland's western border after
a raucous debate marked by charges that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had
endangered the unification process.
   The resolution states that the two Germanys should adopt
identical declarations saying, ``The Polish people are assured that
their right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us
Germans through territorial claims either now or in the future.''
   It further says that the future government of a united Germany
should sign a border treaty on the basis of those declarations.
   After the Parliament session, Kohl traveled to Brussels,
Belgium, to meet with NATO allies. He said he reassured them that
their concerns will be considered in the drive to reunify the two
Germanys.
   ``Nobody has to be concerned that the Germans would one way or
the other want to go it alone,'' he told reporters after a nearly
three-hour meeting at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
headquarters.
   Kohl had come under fire abroad and at home for his previous
reluctance to unequivocally state that a united Germany would never
lay claim to land ceded to Poland after the Third Reich's 1945
defeat.
   In Parliament today, one lawmaker from the opposition Social
Democrats, Juergen Schmude, said Kohl's handling of the border
issue had amounted to ``political arson in the European house.''
   
   Kohl, apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters
before federal elections in December, had insisted that only the
government of a united Germany could address the matter.
   His demands that a border treaty be linked to Polish concessions
also caused an uproar, and he withdrew them earlier this week while
at the same time proposing the resolution passed today.
   In today's parliamentary debate, the opposition Social Democrats
charged that Kohl's pronouncements had seriously endangered the
unification process.
   Party chief Hans-Jochen Vogel said ``seldom has a federal
chancellor ... so mishandled'' his responsibilities to West Germans
``as Chancellor Kohl in the last days and weeks.''
   Vogel charged that Kohl's pronouncements on the matter had
``squandered (international) trust of the German people, which is
now needed more urgently than ever so that our neighbors do not
reject the unification process.''
   In his own address, Kohl battled back by pointing out the Social
Democrats' contacts with East Germany's now-disgraced Communist
Party in past years.
   ``The Social Democrats' contribution to the German politics
(unification matters) in the last years can been characterized as
simply pathetic,'' he charged.
   Kohl also seemed to address concerns by Moscow that he is trying
to make unification occur too quickly.
   ``We are producing no artificial time pressures in order to
speed up unification,'' said Kohl.
   He repeated that a united Germany must be a member of the NATO
alliance, which the Soviets have consistently rejected.
   But he also reiterated that what is now East Germany could have
a special military status in a united Germany, with NATO troops
barred from being stationed there.
   Kohl also rejected fears that a united Germany could become a
too-mighty presence in Europe.
   ``No one needs to be worried about a German dominance in the
European Community. A united Germany would also be a reliable and
solid partner,'' Kohl said.

   Dorothy Horton, 73, of Stroud in western England, said she

   The post card was found behind old closets last week during

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to hear the United
States' appeal for the extradition of Charles McVey, who is accused
of selling computer secrets to the Soviet Union.
   The United States has been trying to extradite McVey, 65, since
August 1987 when he was arrested while on a fishing trip in the
Canadian Yukon community of Teslin. At that time, he had been a
fugitive for four years.
   McVey once ran a computer export business in Orange Country,
Calif.
   U.S. indictments in 1983 and 1987 accuse him of smuggling
computer technology to the Soviets.
   If convicted, sentences could total 125 years, according to U.S.
officials.
   In November, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled McVey
could not be extradited because the charges against him in
California do not constitute an offense under the Canada-U.S.
extradition treaty.
   In its application to appeal to the Supreme Court, the United
States argued the appeals court erred in deciding that an
extradition crime must be an offense listed in the extradition
treaty.
   McVey faces more than 30 charges on the two separate indictments
related to the alleged shipment of Saxpy Matrix-1 supercomputer
technology to the Soviet Union.
   Even if the U.S. extradition efforts fail, McVey still could be
deported by the Canadian government.
   An immigration hearing in Vancouver is looking into the
documents and information that McVey used to enter Canada in 1987
and trying to determine if he stayed longer than permitted.

<HEAD>Armani, Ferre Go Their Own Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general trend presented in Milan this
week during the Italian fall-winter 1990-91 ready-to-wear
collection is ultra-short and sporty.
   But two designers never known to follow the fashion pack,
Gianfranco Ferre and Giorgio Armani, went their own way, showing
discreet hemlines and more town than country clothes.
   Ferre, who also designs for Dior in Paris, presents a woman used
to living in the lap of luxury. The gold theme is threaded
throughout his collection, appearing from the early hours of the
morning in gray mohair sweaters painted with gold to be worn over
flannel sweat pants.
   This theme becomes ever more opulent as the day goes on with
rich gold embroidery on silk brocade jackets and coats for the
cocktail hour, and shimmery gold evening gowns for the grande
soiree.
   The Ferre skirt stops a discreet inch above the knee and the
elegant hemline is enhanced by the simplicity of the footwear:
suede or silk moderately heeled pumps.
   The overall look is closer to couture than ready to wear, and
definitely separates itself from the myriad of fast-fashion mini
skirts, knit body suits, ski jackets and thigh boots that have
permeated the Milan runway this week.
   Ferre did indulge in a series of gold leather parkas with fur
trim, which looked a bit much on the runway but are sure to be a
hit on the slopes of Vail or Gstaad.
   Ferre says he wanted to ``interpret Oriental themes in a
European context.'' The Oriental theme is evident in his choice of
palette _ lots of blue, yellow and multicolored porcelain prints _
the heavy use of gold brocade, of satin and velvet, and the robed
styles in jackets and coats.
   Giorgio Armani also looks to the Orient for inspiration for his
fall-winter 1990-91 collection, particularly in his evening wear.
   Armani, whose day wear with its tailored suits and multitude of
jackets in super soft tweeds, has become a trademark of the ``moda
Milanese,'' has for several seasons concentrated on evening to give
the Armani woman an around-the-clock choice of outfits.
   His after-five wear for next winter is more feminine and
flattering than ever. Delicate gold lace, velvet embroidered with
graceful silk flowers, tiny pearl passamenterie, the softest of
silk printed in dainty porcelain prints, all combine to create an
image of fragile beauty, like a Ming vase.
   The shape too is vase-like, with a tiny velvet richly
embroidered blouse with high collar and long sleeves creating a
narrow bodice to the flowing silk printed skirt or pajama pants
below.
   The new Armani jacket is longer than ever reaching far below the
hip, often with a rounded lapel and silk cord belt like a Chinese
robe. Other jackets have no lapel, are loose and close in a single
button at the shoulder.
   Like Ferre, the Armani skirt is a good many inches longer than
the rest of the Milan runway _ never more than several inches above
the knee. The hemline is rounded and has an unfinished look to it,
a style he introduced several seasons ago.
   Armani says his aim is to let women ``choose their own
direction, without falling into the trap of trendiness.''
   Along with his new feminine look, Armani proposes a series of
man-tailored outfits, to satisfy the woman that identifies his
style with the transposition of menswear into women's clothing.
   The new Armani pant suit in ultra light wool tweeds inspired by
silk tie patterns, has a longer jacket, with narrower shoulders but
a wider rounded base. The trousers are baggy and cuffed; a
masculine shirt with mandarine collar completes the outfit.
   Coats play heavily in the new collection. They are either full
and super-long with plush lining or long slim military coats closed
at the waist by a brown leather silver buckled belt.
   Armani made yet another fashion statement Wednesday night, at
the end of his much applauded collection presented in the theater
of his downtown Milan headquarters.
   For the first time in memory, he appeared on the runway to take
a bow in jacket and tie, as opposed to the usual casual sweater,
throwing down the gauntlet to fellow designer Gianni Versace, who
during the men's collections in January decreed the death of the
tie.
   Versace took his runway bow earlier in the week in a polo shirt.

<HEAD>Anniversary of Martial Law Passes Under Tight Security</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lhasa residents passed the first anniversary of
martial law Thursday under heavy security, and there were no
reports of renewed protests by Tibetan nationalists.
   Authorities felt confident enough of their control to allow
Tibet's strongly nationalist Buddhist monks to hold a major prayer
festival, Moinlam Qenmo, which has been the occasion of
anti-Chinese protests in the past.
   The 10-day festival, which began last week, draws hundreds of
monks to Lhasa's ancient Jokhang Temple. Last year, Chinese
authorities canceled the festival for fear of unrest, but Tibetans
held a small march anyway.
   Police opened fire, triggering three days of violent clashes
that ended when martial law took effect March 8. It was the fourth
bloody confrontation with Tibetan nationalists since 1987.
   Lhasa authorities, who have tightly restricted tourism to the
remote city in the past year, made sure even fewer foreigners would
be there this week.
   Travel agents in Chengdu, the main gateway to Lhasa, said no new
tour groups were being allowed in from March 1 until March 15.
   One of the few foreigners in Lhasa, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said by telephone that the city appeared quiet Thursday.
   Sporadic reports in recent weeks indicate that authorities
stepped up already tight security in anticipation of the
anniversary.
   The People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force, paraded through
the city center on Feb. 20. The local radio said thousands of
police, a column of armored cars and other vehicles took part in
the parade, held to ``display their majestic appearance.''
   A special team was sent into a leading monastery, Ganden, to
``weed out rioters,'' according to another official report. Police
also said they arrested six people for alleged separatist
activities and seized several guns, bullets, separatist leaflets
and banned Tibetan flags.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the government shipped half
a ton of butter to Lhasa for last month's celebration of Tibetan
New Year in an apparent effort to placate the public. Tibetans use
butter in tea and burn it in candles at religious shrines.
   At the same time, authorities issued stern warnings against
renewed protests.
   ``We must fully maintain our vigilance,'' the local radio quoted
Tibetan Communist Party Secretary Hu Jintao as saying. ``If those
separatist elements dare to stir up trouble again, we will
resolutely strike a heavy blow at them.''
   China claims sovereignty over Tibet dating back to the 13th
century. But there were long periods when Tibet had virtually no
contact with China, and nationalists say it was actually
independent.
   China's Red Army entered in 1950. The Chinese set up communes,
closed monasteries and for years banned traditional religious and
cultural activies. In the 1980s China reopened several monasteries,
but many Tibetans remain bitter.
   Small-scale protests have continued despite martial law. In
September, a small group of Buddhist nuns shouted pro-independence
slogans during a festival and were arrested immediately.
   When Tibet's exiled religious leader, the Dalai Lama, won the
Nobel Peace Prize in October, Tibetans showed their joy by making
ritual offerings of barley flour outside the Jokhang.

   A tugboat collided with a 38,100-ton Navy
oiler Thursday as the oil-laden vessel set out for Europe.
   There were no reports of injuries or spilled oil, but the
collision left a 3-by-5-foot hole in the oiler's hull more than 8
feet above the waterline, the Navy said.
   The accident occurred around 8:30 a.m. as the Savannah was being
pushed by a Navy tugboat from a Norfolk Naval Station pier into the
Elizabeth River channel, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a spokesman for
the Norfolk-based Atlantic Fleet Surface Force.
   From there, the Savannah was to join up with the carrier Dwight
D. Eisenhower and 13 other ships for a routine six-month battle
group deployment in the Mediterranean.
   The Savannah, a 659-foot vessel with a crew of about 450, can
carry up to 8.8 million gallons of fuel. It also carries 600 tons
of munitions, 200 tons of dry stores and 100 tons of refrigerated
stores.
   Lloyd said the ship was taken to an anchorage area in Hampton
Roads across from the naval station, where an engineering team was
assessing the damage.
   No decision had been made on whether the Savannah could be
repaired in time to rejoin the battle group.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Policy on Abortion in Foreign Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that the Reagan
administration acted within the Constitution when in 1984 it barred
family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform
abortions.
   ``It is within the executive branch's plenary authority over
foreign affairs to disassociate the United States completely from
foreign organizations based upon their views or activities,'' U.S.
District Judge John Walker said in a decision Wednesday.
   Walker made the finding in dismissing a lawsuit by the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America challenging the policy.
   The policy, which was adopted by the Agency for International
Development in 1984 and continued under President Bush, requires
that foreign private health agencies, in return for American
grants, certify that they did not perform or actively promote
abortion as a method of family planning.
   Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had
charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment
right to advocate abortion and interfered with the rights of
privacy of people seeking family planning information.
   Roger Evans, Planned Parenthood's director of litigation, said
the organization would appeal the judge's ruling.
   The ruling was the second time Walker had dismissed the lawsuit.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the lawsuit back to
Walker, saying he must decide the constitutional questions of free
speech and free association of American workers overseas who are
affected by the policy.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that buried parts of Colorado and Wyoming under 4 feet
of snow turned into freezing rain as it moved eastward, snapping
power lines and turning roadways into ice rinks. Half the homes in
Des Moines, Iowa, were without power today.
   The snow cleanup was expected to get easier today, with
temperatures expected to soar into the 50s.
   ``When you step off the curb, you're probably going to step into
a slush pile,'' Craig Sanders, forecaster for the National Weather
Service said Wednesday night in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   About 130 miles of interstate highway were still closed in
Wyoming early today as crews tried to clear snow drifts and
abandoned cars. The storm dumped up to 50 inches of snow in parts
of northern Colorado and shut down travel from the Denver area to
southeastern Wyoming.
   South of the snow belt, the weather system produced as much as 7
inches of rain overnight in parts of Arkansas, and a school bus was
swept off a flooded road and into a rain-swollen ditch today near
Cabot, northeast of Little Rock, Lonoke County officials said.
Students had to be rescued by pontoon boat but none was injured,
said dispatcher Barbara Eddy.
   The fierce storm, driven by winds up to 50 mph, was blamed for
at least one traffic death in Colorado, and some highways were
closed and littered with stuck and stalled vehicles Wednesday.
   The freezing rain moved into Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Wisconsin and Minnesota, coating power lines, roads and tree limbs
and knocking out electricity.
   ``It's just like an ice skating rink on the interstate,'' said
Bob Gantz, a mechanic for Dave's Auto Repair in Ankeny, Iowa. ``The
patrolmen couldn't even stand up on the pavement to direct
traffic.''
   Hundreds of schools closed or opened late today in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Snow and sleet became mixed with rain
early today, with an inch or two of snow reported in parts of
central Minnesota, the weather service said.
   ``Definitely (I) wouldn't want to travel today if I didn't have
to,'' said forecaster Bill Harrison of the National Weather Service
in Minneapolis.
   Half of the village of Hemingford in the Nebraska Panhandle lost
electricity Wednesday, as branches fell on power lines. ``It sounds
like we have a lot of lumberjacks outside,'' said Peggy Reynold,
administrator in the village of 1,023.
   At least 90,000 Iowa Power customers in central Iowa were
without electricity today, and company spokesman John McCarroll
said it may be the largest winter outage in the company's history.
Schools were closed for the first time this winter in Des Moines.
   Police said nearly every street in Des Moines was closed or
partly closed at some point by downed lines or fallen limbs. Thick
fog covered the city early today, cutting visibility during morning
rush-hour traffic.
   Commuters in Colorado today faced slush-covered highways, still
strewn with abandoned vehicles. The public transit system in Denver
was back on schedule today, after cancellation of up to 30 bus
routes Wednesday. But at least two school districts decided to keep
all schools closed for another day.
   Snow continued to fall overnight in southern Wyoming, northern
Colorado and southwest Nebraska. Freezing rain extended from
north-central Nebraska across parts of South Dakota, the southern
half of Minnesota and parts of Iowa.
   Rain and a few thunderstorms reached from western Wisconsin
across western Illinois, and parts of Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska,
Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   The heavy ice brought opportunities as well. In Webster City,
Iowa, a 74-year-old man startled patrons of a truck stop by
whizzing around the parking lot on a 50-year-old pair of hockey
skates.
   ``It's the best skating I've had all winter,'' said Elmer Clare.

   Charlotte M. Sitterly, an astrophysicist who
discovered one of the unstable elements in sunlight, has died of
heart failure.
   Mrs. Sitterly, who was 91, died in her Washington home last
Saturday. She was considered one of the world's foremost
authorities on the composition of the sun.
   Her discovery of technetium, an element, changed scientific
explanations of conditions in the sun's interior.
   Her research focused on the study of the sun's spectrum,
including short-wavelengths that could not penetrate the atmosphere
and could only be observed from rockets.
   She was born Charlotte Emma Moore in Ercildoun in Chester
County, Pa. and married Bancroft Walker Sitterly, a colleague at
the Princeton University Observatory, in 1937. They had no
children, and he is deceased.
   Mrs. Sitterly was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate in mathematics from
Swarthmore College in 1920. She earned her doctorate from the
University of California at Berkeley, writing a thesis on the
spectra of sunspots.
   She worked as an astrophysicist with the Department of
Commerce's Bureau of National Standards and wrote many works on
solar and atomic spectra.
   Mrs. Sitterly was cited as one of the first recipients of the
Federal Woman's Award and was the first woman elected as a foreign
associate by the Royal Astronomical Society of London in 1949.

<HEAD>Sources: Panel To Seek Immunity For Former Pierce Aide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House investigators will seek a grant of
immunity for a onetime aide of Samuel R. Pierce Jr., seeking
testimony that Pierce made politically tainted contract awards as
housing secretary in the Reagan administration, sources said
Thursday.
   The former Department of Housing and Urban Development official,
Dubois Gilliam, is serving a federal prison sentence for a
conviction in a HUD-related case.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
employment and housing panel of the Government Operations Committee
would ask a federal court to grant Gilliam immunity from
prosecution for any crimes he might discuss during congressional
testimony.
   Pierce has refused to testify to the subcommittee. He is also
being investigated by an independent counsel to determine whether
there was illegal activity in the awarding of grants under a HUD
rehabilitation program.
   Several former Pierce aides have refused to testify before the
subcommittee, citing their Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. Among them was Deborah Dean, Pierce's former
top aide. The panel considered seeking a grant of immunity to
compel her testimony but then dropped the idea.
   A HUD source described the move with Gilliam as a breakthrough,
saying he ``knows everything.''
   Pierce has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has accused the
subcommittee of targeting him despite evidence to support his
position.
   The independent counsel, former federal judge Alvin Adams, met
with subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., this week and said
he would not object if the subcommittee sought immunity for
Gilliam, the sources said.
   Pierce attorney Paul L. Perito said he questioned whether
Gilliam would provide truthful testimony or merely seek to curry
support for a reduced sentence. Perito also objected to the
development on grounds it could interfere with the independent
counsel's review.
   Gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary in HUD's community
planning and development office, a post that gave him oversight of
Urban Development Action Grants and a technical assistance program
paid for through discretionary funds.
   Subcommittee aides recently visited him at the California prison
where he is serving an 18-month sentence, and the sources said he
could provide testimony about the role of Pierce in contract awards.
   Former HUD officials described Gilliam as a trusted Pierce aide
who was in line to become the secretary's executive assistant.
Agency documents show many funding requests were routed through
Gilliam.
   A 1986 internal audit of the technical assistance program
roundly criticized its administration, saying most contracts were
for proposals that had been sent to HUD unsolicited, often were
approved although incomplete or unnecessary and then were financed
at levels that allowed exorbitant overhead costs.
   An Associated Press review of the program last year found that
among the grant recipients was the Match Institution, a company
headed by a man Pierce had picked to head a black Republican panel
set up to advise Reagan. Also benefiting from the program was a
company called One America Inc., whose president once served as
chairwoman of the GOP group, the Council of 100.
   Also receiving technical assistance funding was a Mississippi
company called Pro-Mark, whose owner had a longstanding association
with Gilliam.
   Both One America and Pro-Mark first received technical
assistance grants during Gilliam's tenure, which ended in early
1988. HUD documents show One America President Elaine B. Jenkins
wrote Gilliam several times seeking additional grants.
   Pierce, in his final days in office, signed contracts making new
grants to both One America and Pro-Mark, according to HUD documents
and interviews. But those contracts were canceled by HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp shortly after he took over for Pierce.
   Gilliam was quoted in The New York Times as saying Pierce
ordered him to give a $300,000 grant to a longtime Pierce friend,
Samuel Singletary, who had managed Pierce's unsuccessful campaigns
for a New York judgeship. Pierce's order overruled agency officials
who had recommended rejection of the proposal, Gilliam said.
   Gilliam, as part of a plea agreement in the Mississippi case,
pleaded guilty to accepting cash gifts from a HUD contractor and
conspiring to use a HUD grant for personal gain.

<HEAD>Health Officials Say Millions of Youngsters Face Lead Dangers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite efforts to reduce lead in the
environment, millions of American children have levels of lead in
their blood that could cause health problems, a government official
told Congress Thursday.
   Dr. Vernon N. Houk, director of environmental health for the
federal Centers for Disease Control, said lead exposure is
``devastating'' to the developing brains and nervous systems of
fetuses and young children.
   Experts have steadily reduced their estimate of blood lead
levels that have toxic effects, so that blood lead levels that
cause concern for young children today _ 10 to 15 micrograms per
deciliter _ are one-sixth the levels of concern in the 1960s and
before, Houk said.
   ``Today in the United States, millions of children from all
geographic areas and socioeconomic strata have blood lead levels
high enough to cause adverse health effects,'' he said.
   Houk was joined by other federal health and housing officials,
private health advocates and lead industry officials in discussing
the toxic effects of lead before the Senate Environment and Public
Works subcommittee on toxic substances, environmental oversight,
research and development.
   Dr. Ellen K. Silbergeld, a scientist with the New York-based
Environmental Defense Fund, cited federal estimates in 1988 that
nearly three million children under the age of 6 have lead levels
considered dangerous.
   She said her group estimated 50 percent of children under 6 are
affected by lead from lead-based paint, and 90 percent of urban
minority poor children may be affected.
   Lead has been used in paints, gasoline, solders, batteries and
other products. Many uses have been decreased or eliminated, such
as lead in gasoline and in paints.
   But lead continues to be used some areas and remains in the
environment in existing paints, plumbing systems, and in dust and
soils, said Victor J. Kimm, deputy assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency's office of pesticides and toxic
substances.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the estimates of exposure in
children are alarming and called for increased federal efforts to
regulate and clean up lead in the environment.

   Federal investigators focused on a motor
found hanging loose under a subway car as they looked for the cause
of a derailment that peeled open a train ``like a sardine can,''
killing three people and injuring 162.
   The subway line, which normally serves 100,000 riders per day,
was out of service today. Transit employees used bullhorns to
direct passengers to and from 97 buses temporarily assigned to the
east-west city streets above the empty tunnel. Police lined the bus
routes to keep traffic moving during the morning rush.
   News reports citing unidentified sources said the dragging
electric motor may have hit a switch and caused the train to jump
the tracks Wednesday, and passengers reported bumping and a ``bam,
bam, bam'' before the accident.
   The train smashed into three support beams during the morning
rush hour, trapping victims for up to five hours. A surgeon who
took part in the rescue, Dr. Jina Joder, said she used a
paramedic's buck knife to cut the leg off a dead man to free a
victim beneath him.
   Officials said it was the worst accident in the 21 years the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has operated the
regional commuter system, whose trains run underground downtown and
above ground in outlying areas.
   National Transportation Safety Board member John Lauber said
late Wednesday that one end of the motor had separated from the
train and that railroad ties leading up to the accident scene were
chipped.
   Lauber said his agency is investigating whether the broken motor
was a cause or effect of the accident. Russell Gober, NTSB
investigator in charge, said he had not yet checked the maintenance
and inspection records of the car.
   ``I was in the first car and as we went through the station, you
could hear the train hit something, like something was dragging. It
went bam, bam, bam,'' said Mark Robinson, who was en route home
from an overnight cashier's job.
   ``The second and third cars were bent and the whole side of the
second car was torn off,'' Robinson said. ``It was peeled like a
sardine can.''
   Doctors amputated the right leg of one woman to free her from
the wreckage, but she died four hours later of complications from a
second broken leg and severe chest injuries, said Hahnemann
University Hospital spokeswoman Linda Clossey.
   All three of the dead were among seven passengers trapped in the
wreckage, authorities said. Of the 162 people treated at 10
hospitals, two remained in critical condition this morning. More
than 100 were treated and released.
   ``People were screaming,'' said passenger Robert Rogers. ``It
was dark and people were going left and right and were falling off
the tracks and stuff.''
   Lauber said the NTSB hadn't seen any reason to order other cars
pulled off the subway line, which serves about 100,000 riders a day.
   ``If in the course of the investigation, we run into anything
that demands immediate attention, we would issue an emergency
recommendation,'' he said.
   Louis Gambaccini, the transit authority's general manager, said
the cars on the line are about 30 years old and there had been no
indication of problems. He said the cars have been well maintained
but that the entire fleet will be inspected.
   However, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported today that bolts
holding the motors in place have broken before and that the transit
agency tried to solve the problem by bracing the motors with a bar
under them.
   A preliminary inspection indicated there was no danger of a
cave-in of the subway tunnel, said transit inspector James Sweeney.
   The city medical examiner's office identified one of the dead as
Denise Devlin, 34, of Philadelphia. The name of a 52-year-old
Philadelphia man was withheld until his family could be notified,
and a third victim, a 60-year-old woman, could not immediately be
identified.

<TEXT>
   President Bush announced today a new
transportation policy that calls for more user fees, toll roads and
local government help. He said it would help keep America ``the
world leader in transportation.''
   Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner unveiled the
long-awaited policy, ``Moving America Into The 21st Century, '' to
members of Congress and industry officials, many of whom already
had found reason to criticize it.
   Its overall goal is to maintain the U.S. transportation system
as ``the finest in the world.'' However, the report said ``there
are increasing signs ... that the system is beginning to break
down.''
   ``If we work together in this joint venture, America can
continue to be the world leader in transportation,'' Bush said.
   ``When transportation lags or is congested, when people and
goods are stranded in traffic or in airports, they will suffer,''
Bush said. ``When people and goods flow through a responsive,
well-maintained and efficient transportation system, our quality of
life improves with it.''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the Senate surface
transportation subcommittee, said, ``I'm going to be looking
through this to see whether or not this simply doesn't transfer the
problems we have with the infrastructure as we head to the 21st
century off the backs of the federal government and onto the backs
of state and local governments.''
   He questioned the administration's logic. ``They said today that
moving people in a speedy fashion was obviously necessary while at
the same time they're suggesting that we zero out all subsidies for
Amtrak,'' Exon said.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., chairman of the House surface
transportation subcommittee, called the proposal ``a good start''
but said the administration had failed to address ``the big
question'' of funding.
   Shifting programs to the state and local level without financial
resources ``would be the shift and the shaft,'' said Mineta.
   Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, the top Republican on
the House subcommittee, said, ``I think the money has to come from
users, one way or another, and because it is a national plan, the
logical way for it to come from users is through a national tax
system.''
   A coalition of 16 aviation industry groups said it opposes
Bush's proposed increases in aviation taxes, which the president's
fiscal 1991 budget calls ``user fees.'' The American Public Transit
Association said the policy was ``long on advice and short on
help.''
   The 129-page policy, published in a book with illustrations
showing everything from a futuristic airplane to a traffic-clogged
freeway, covered a wide range of issues affecting air, land and
water transportation.
   Anyone looking for a far-reaching program such as the interstate
highway system begun in the Eisenhower administration is likely to
be disappointed.
   The policy statement outlined no strategy that would involve
major federal funding beyond that already called for in the
president's budget.
   It proposed that users, including airline passengers and
motorists, pay more of the cost of building, maintaining and
administering major transport systems.
   The policy set out six key goals:
   _Maintain and expand the nation's transportation system by
shifting major responsibilities onto local governments and
encouraging more private investment, while concentrating federal
funding on projects of ``national significance.''
   _Foster a ``sound financial base'' for transportation,
emphasizing user fees ``as the key element to financing the federal
share of transportation expenditures,'' as well as spending some of
the billions of dollars in the aviation and highway trust funds.
   _Keep transportation businesses strong and competitive by
deregulating the trucking industry and further deregulating other
transportation sectors, including repealing railroad employee
liability and retirement laws opposed by the rail industry.
   _Ensure that the transportation system supports public safety
and national security.
   _Protect the environment and the quality of life by reducing
pollution emissions by motor vehicles.
   _Advance U.S. transportation technology for the 21st century by
encouraging research into high-speed rail, magnetically levitated
trains, tiltrotor aircraft and ``intelligent'' vehicle and highway
systems that use computers to increase safety and efficiency.
   Proposals that shift more of the cost to users are rising
concerns in the aviation, mass transit and trucking industries.
   Skinner had described the policy to industry groups, and some
people outside government saw drafts before it was released.
   The Transportation Department began working on the proposal
shortly after Skinner took office early last year, holding 117
hearings in 48 cities to get suggestions
   The public transit group said, ``The administration's policy
would give Uncle Sam junior partnership in the traditional
intergovernmental alliance that has underwritten mass transit for
more than 25 years,'' the group said in a statement.
   The Air Transport Association said it generally supported the
new policy but opposed an airport head tax that is included. Bush
called for such a fee, as well as other user charges, in his fiscal
1991 budget.
   ATA, which represents major airlines, also has been looking for
clear national standards on noise levels at airports and a
timetable for phasing out older, noisier airliners. Neither is
found in the new policy.
   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, speaking for
thousands of private pilots, said the policy would have the federal
government rely too much on state and local governments for
improvements in aviation.
   The American Trucking Associations objected to Skinner's call
for more toll roads and to the lack of a detailed plan for spending
the $10 billion surplus in the highway trust fund, collected from
federal gasoline taxes.
   Jerry Bastarache, spokesman for the Highway Users Federation,
said the group generally likes the policy because it calls for
greater capacity and highway improvements.
   But he said some areas cause concern, including toll roads and
proposals for higher proportions of matching funds from local
governments in Transportation Department projects.

   A settlement was reached today in a negligence
lawsuit filed by a doctor who contends she contracted AIDS from a
contaminated needle at a city hospital.
   The settlement came as closing arguments were scheduled to begin
in the two-month-old trial in trial-level state Supreme Court. Dr.
Veronica Prego sued the city's publicly funded Health and Hospitals
Corp. and two physicians, charging negligence.
   Justice Aaron Bernstein directed lawyers not to disclose the
terms.
   ``It's no one's business except the people who are paying it and
the person who's receiving it,'' Bernstein said.
   Prego, 32, said she developed AIDS after pricking her finger in
1983 on a syringe left in a pile of gauze and bed linen at Kings
County Hospital. She sued for $175 million in damages, but the
figure later was dropped to allow a jury to decide damages.
   Prego accused her supervising intern of carelessly leaving the
needle in the soiled refuse after drawing blood from an AIDS
patient. But the intern testified that she did not take blood from
the patient that night and was not in the room when Prego's injury
occurred.
   City lawyers said Prego drew the blood herself.
   Prego also claimed in the lawsuit that another doctor violated
her confidentiality in a study of health care workers who
contracted AIDS.

<HEAD>Government Will Ban Over-the-Counter Prostate Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday
it will ban the sale of all nonprescription drugs used to treat
enlargement of the prostate gland.
   The agency said its review of these products found little
evidence any of them eliminates, arrests or treats the condition,
called benign prostatic hypertrophy.
   Surgery is currently the only effective treatment, the FDA said.
   The condition causes enlargement of the male gland, which can
obstruct the flow of urine, create back pressure in the kidneys and
cause urinary tract infections that are difficult to treat, the FDA
said.
   The over-the-counter products, which contain the amino acids
glycine, alanine and glutamic acid and a plant extract called
sabal, can relieve some symptoms of the condition. However, their
use also could lull men with the condition ``into a sense of false
security,'' which could delay their getting proper treatment, the
agency said.
   Few of these products are being sold today, the FDA said.
   About 50 percent to 80 percent of men with the condition will
develop unstable bladders and have symptoms of frequency and
urgency of urination.
   The FDA said the ban will take effect in six months.
   The agency's review of the products was part of its ongoing
review of over-the-counter drugs.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Robert J. Flemma, a surgeon who lead
research into an artificial heart, died of heart diease. He was 56.
   Flemma, who died Wednesday at St. Luke's Medical Center, had
predicted in August that a device known as the Milwaukee Heart
would be available for human use in seven years.
   The device is to be a wholly implanted, electrically powered
heart to aid patients with cardiomyopathy, the degenerative
condition that led to Flemma's death.
   ``Bob had a vision of the ultimate value of an artificial
instrument that could be used in situations not dissimilar to the
one that led to his death,'' said Brenton H. Rupple, vice chairman
of the Milwaukee Heart Research Foundation.
   Flemma said human hearts were in short supply and that a
reliable mechanical device was needed for the thousands of patients
who die while awaiting human heart transplants.
   He had been in Salt Lake City, awaiting a transplant at the
University of Utah Hospital when he suffered cardiac arrest in
January. After the attack, he was no longer considered a transplant
candidate and never regained consciousness.
   Flemma, who lived in suburban River Hills, was a clinical
professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin and
University of Wisconsin Medical School.
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Ann, and six children.
   Funeral services are scheduled for Saturday.

   Oliver North will testify that he ``lied ...
lied ... lied'' to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair on
instructions from John Poindexter, a prosecutor said today in
opening statements at Poindexter's trial.
   ``North was not out there as a lone ranger over this
multimillion-dollar enterprise'' to assist the Nicaraguan rebels,
Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb told a jury of seven women and five
men. ``Defendant John Poindexter was right in the middle of'' it.
   Webb told the jury that North, the government's leadoff witness,
``will tell you'' that after being ``instructed by Poindexter,'' he
met with then-House intelligence committee chairman Lee Hamilton on
Aug. 6, 1986.
   At that meeting, North ``was asked question after question''
about whether he was raising money and providing military
assistance to the Contras, said Webb. ``Specific names were used,
places.''
   Webb, previewing North's upcoming testimony, said: ``He lied, he
lied, he lied, one false statement after another.''
   ``Every answer he gave is false. It worked like a charm,'' said
Webb. Hamilton later told Poindexter to ``thank Nlegal gratuity.
   North's testimony was crucial to Iran-Contra prosecutors because
it bolsters their assertion that Poindexter was trying to cover up
from Congress his knowledge of a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Iran and North's covert military
assistance to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Poindexter's lawyers contended that North's statements on both
points were based on testimony that Poindexter gave to Congress in
1987 under a grant of immunity. Prosecutors disagreed.
   No part of a prosecutor's case may be derived from a defendant's
immunized testimony.
   The government contends that Poindexter's knowledge of the
existence of the finding was his motive in November 1986 for
concealing from Congress the U.S. involvement in the missile
shipment.

<HEAD>Military Base Lease Talks Set for After Easter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiations to extend the stay of
U.S. military bases were set for mid-April, and their success
depends on how the United States explains aid cuts, the foreign
secretary said Thursday.
   No specific agenda has been set for the preliminary talks, said
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
   ``This is an exploratory talk. We don't expect commitments,'' he
said. ``We will have to assess the responses and attitudes of the
U.S. government in order to help us arrive at our own decision.''
   He said the Philippines is particularly interested in hearing
the reasons why Congress cut $96 million in aid in January.
   Some Filipinos consider the reduction a violation of the October
1988 agreement under which the United States offered to give the
Philippines about $962 million in the last two years of the 1947
Military Bases Agreement, which expires in 1991.
   About 2,000 members of militant feminist groups, marking
International Women's Day, marched to the U.S. Embassy calling for
the immediate dismantling of the six U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Speaking at a rally in front of the embassy, Sister Mary John
Mananzan, a Roman Catholic nun and head of the leftist Gabriela
Women's Alliance, said the bases obstructed Philippine economic
progress because they represented foreign control of the country.
   ``We say, `Out with the U.S. military bases so that we can
achieve genuine development,''' she said.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base
and four other smaller facilities in the Philippines.
   A new bases treaty must be ratified by two-thirds of the
Philippines' 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is
strong. Also, many in the 195-member House of Representatives have
urged President Corazon Aquino to postpone the talks until the aid
is restored.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to say publicly whether she supports
extending the stay of the U.S. bases, but has agreed to talks.
   Meanwhile, a clandestine leftwing rebel umbrella group, the
National Democratic Front, distributed a statement at the
demonstration accusing Mrs. Aquino of being a puppet of the United
States who has connived with other Filipino officials to keep the
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   The Front, which includes the outlawed Communist Party of the
Philippines and its military arm, the New People's Army, urged
Filipinos to take up arms and wage ``liberating violence'' against
the ``criminal U.S. and its running dogs.''

<HEAD>Police Blame Arson for Restaurant Fire That Killed 11</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arson was the likely cause of a
fire that swept through a downtown restaurant and killed 11 people,
including four Americans, police said Thursday.
   Police first suspected that a gas leak in the kitchen may have
caused the Wednesday night fire that gutted Koryo, a Chinese-Korean
restaurant near Frankfurt's cathedral and the Zeil shopping
district.
   ``Evidence now points more to arson,'' said police spokesman
Manfred Fuellhardt after investigators searched the gutted
restaurant.
   He said the fire broke out in a storage room, under the wooden
stairs leading to the restaurant on the second floor of the
five-story building.
   Smoke quickly filled the restaurant and some guests were injured
when they jumped from windows to escape the flames, Fuellhardt
said. He said the fire exit apparently was blocked.
   Fuellhardt said the victims suffocated. Seven people were
injured, five of them seriously, police said.
   The dead included an American couple, both age 33, Fuellhardt
said.
   Another police official, Franz Winkler, said two children,
including the couple's 1{-year-old son, also died. The other child
was an American girl of about 12 or 13, he said.
   Winkler said it was still not clear if the girl was the child of
the couple, a relative or a friend out with them for the evening.
   Two of the couple's other children, a 4-year-old boy and a
6-year-old girl, suffered serious injuries, Winkler said.
   At least three of the dead were connected with U.S. forces
stationed in West Germany, said U.S. Army spokeswoman Brigitte
Schmitz. She declined to release their identities until relatives
could be told.
   In addition to the Americans, the dead included three German
women, a French woman and her British husband, a Korean man, and a
person believed to be a restaurant employee.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Service officer Felix Bloch, suspected
of spying for the Soviet Union, has asked to appear before a
diplomatic review board to appeal his dismissal as a security risk,
the State Department said Thursday.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said the
appearance was requested by Bloch's attorney but no hearing date
had been set.
   The department announced on Feb. 8 that Bloch, 54, had been
suspended, his annual salary of $80,700 was being withheld and
steps were being taken to fire him.
   The action was taken under provisions of a law permitting the
suspension or dismissal of a federal employee ``in the interest of
national security.'' Bloch had 30 days to file an appeal, which
must be considered by a review board of Foreign Service officers.
   The three-person Foreign Service review board has the option of
reinstating Bloch.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said: ``If he is not reinstated his employment
will be terminated.''
   Bloch has been under investigation since he was placed on paid
leave on June 22. He has not been charged with any crime.
   The government suspects Bloch was recruited by the Soviet Union
during the early 1970s. From 1983 to 1987 Bloch was deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. When he was suspended on
June he was director of the department's office of regional
economic policy for Europe.
   It was reported last year that Bloch was videotaped passing a
suitcase to a known Soviet KGB officer in Paris and has been under
investigation since.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the hearing will be closed because there will
be ``discussions of national security and intelligence matters.''
   She said she did not know if Bloch can take his case to the
courts if his appeal is rejected.

<HEAD>Government Approves Draft Austerity Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday approved a
draft of the 1990 budget that will include major cuts in defense,
state subsidies and funding for the Communist Party, an official
said.
   Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus said the austerity measures will
cut $1.5 billion from a budget first proposed by the nation's
Communist government before it was overthrown peacefully late last
year.
   ``We have managed to turn a budget calling for a deficit of $1
billion into a budget with a $500 million surplus,'' Klaus said.
   He said savings will also be made by slashing price subsidies in
agriculture, mining, administration and security, but gave no
further details.
   Klaus said price rises were inevitable on heavily subsidized
items such as food, housing and transportation and said he expected
the price rises to be felt even before free elections scheduled for
June 8-9.
   ``There is nothing to wait for, the elections can be no
watershed. A cheap policy could be counterproductive,'' Klaus said.
He said a compensation scheme was being prepared to help those who
will be hardest hit by the price increases.
   The new budget requires final approval by parliament.
   Czechoslovakia's current inflation rate is between 2.5 percent
and 3.5 percent and the nation has a foreign debt of $7.9 billion,
one of the lowest per capita in the Soviet bloc, Czechoslovak
Premier Marian Calfa said in his February report to parliament.
   Klaus also said state-owned industries will be sold to the
private sector ``very quickly'' but 30 to 40 mostly public service
industries such as railways and water will remain under state
control.

<TEXT>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A committee at Louisiana State University Medical
Center concluded today that it should not stop researchers from
firing pellets into the brains of anesthetized cats despite
opposition from animal rights groups.
   The $2 million project, funded by the Department of Defense, was
suspended in November pending results of the internal review and a
U.S. General Accounting Office study of the program. The status of
the GAO study hasn't been made public.
   Dr. Michael E. Carey of LSU has said his project is aimed at
studying head injuries and evaluating treatments.
   ``The committee concluded that the project addressed critical
scientific problems and that Dr. Carey's approach was well
conceived, proper, and made maximum effort to protect the welfare
of animals,'' the review committee's report said.
   The research involving hundreds of animals is designed to learn
how to return brain-injured soldiers to active duty.
   A group called the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine
had asked Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to cancel the contract,
saying the research is redundant, scientifically flawed and
ethically unacceptable.
   The group said the primary conclusions by LSU researchers is
that respiration stops when the brain is injured _ information
critics say had been documented in neurosurgical literature for
nearly 100 years.
   The LSU faculty committee reviewing the project, made up of five
medical doctors and two Ph.D.s, said Carey's project had received
unwarranted and distorted coverage in the news media.
   ``The committee was adamant in the opinion that the project
should be continued and that the university should take the
position of a strong defense on behalf of Dr. Carey,'' the report
said.

<HEAD>Medicare to Begin Covering Liver Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will begin paying for certain
liver transplants in Medicare beneficiaries, Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced Thursday.
   Medicare is expected to spend $10 million for the operations in
the first year and $120 million by the fifth year, as more
hospitals gain approval for reimbursement under the liver
transplant program.
   But Sulliivan said the net impact on the Medicare budget would
be lower because the transplants will save the costs of treating
patients with advanced liver disease. He did not estimate the
expected savings.
   Under the proposed rule, Medicare payment would allowed for
transplants in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, primary
sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B, antigen negative or
postnecrotic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, Alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency disease, Wilson's disease and primary hemochromatosis.
   A Public Health Service study found liver transplants are safe
and effective in treating those conditions in adults.
   More than 3,500 liver transplants have been performed in the
United States.
   To qualify for payment under the program, a hospital must have a
written patient-selection process for choosing patients for whom
the operation is most likely to be successful.
   They also must show that at least 77 percent of their adult
patients with the conditions covered under the program survive for
at least one year after receiving a new liver, and that 60 percent
of them live at least two years.
   The process is similar to the system used to approve hospitals
for performing heart transplants on Medicare beneficiaries, the
department said.
   After a 60-day period for public comment, a final regulation
will be published in the Federal Register and become effective.

   Turkey's Armenian community will hold a

   The patriarch, who headed Turkey's 60,000-member Armenian
community since 1961, arrived in Armenia on Saturday in connection
with a commemoration of the 1988 Armenian earthquake.
   Arman said Kaloustian will be buried in the Armenian cemetery in
Istanbul following a service in the Virgin Mary Church on March 18.
   The Armenian community will elect a new patriarch through
district representatives after a traditional mourning period of 40
days, he said.

   Two weeks before her fraud and racketeering
trial, Imelda Marcos is trying to follow her lawyers' advice. But
sometimes it's hard for a woman used to the world as her forum to
keep quiet.
   For months, the 60-year-old Mrs. Marcos has ignored incessant
interview requests, choosing instead to pore over legal documents
in a cool, dark room that was once the wine cellar of her Makiki
Heights home.
   Her new lead attorney, Wyoming maverick Gerry Spence, said the
only way the usually outspoken Mrs. Marcos will get a fair trial in
this country is if she keeps her mouth shut and lets the evidence
speak for itself.
   ``She has been branded as a crook and a thief, everyone thinks
of her as `that woman with the shoes,''' Spence said in a recent
telephone interview.
   Nearly every evening, she visits the tomb of her late husband,
former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos. The visits are timed
to avoid tourists.
   On Wednesday night, Mrs. Marcos broke her silence, saying in an
interview that she is a misunderstood, nervous and lonely widow,
and fears standing trial now that her defense team has been shaken
up.
   Washington attorney Richard Hibey withdrew from the case less
than a month before her federal trial in New York was scheduled to
begin.
   ``I don't know how my present lawyers can familiarize themselves
with more than three years of litigation just before my trial,''
she said. ``This is most unjust and so detrimental to my defense.''
   Hibey and attorney Sandor Frankel of New York withdrew after
prosecutors said Hibey faced a possible conflict of interest
because they intended to call one of his partners as a witness.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan delayed the start of the trial
for six days, to March 20.
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband, who died in September, were charged
in October 1988 with fraud and racketeering counts accusing them of
stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy
art and real estate. They also were charged with defrauding banks
of $165 million in loans.
   Defense attorneys say the key to Mrs. Marcos' defense is proving
that the Marcoses were forced out of the Philippines during a 1986
popular revolt with a promise of safe haven in the United States,
and that they did not leave willingly, even though protesters
threatened to overrun the presidential palace.
   Chief prosecutor Charles LaBella refused to comment on the case.
   Although exile in Hawaii has meant a series of ``indignities,''
life was never bleaker than after Marcos died, Mrs. Marcos said.
She added that mounting medical, funeral and legal expenses and
Philippine President Corazon Aquino's refusal to let him be buried
in his homeland also were discouraging.
   The late dictator ruled the Philippines for two decades.
   Most of the Marcos' alleged billions of dollars in assets have
been frozen as part of the criminal indictment and because of more
than a dozen civil lawsuits accusing the Marcoses of acts ranging
from corruption to murder.
   Mrs. Marcos refused to say where she gets her money, allowing
only that ``millions'' of dollars in legal and medical bills remain
unpaid and that she relies on the goodwill of friends to stay
afloat.
   The U.S. government does not control Mrs. Marcos spending
habits, but requires her to submit a monthly accounting and receive
special permission if she wants to spend more than $10,000 a month.
   Marcos aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said the budget
has fallen sharply from a high of about $200,000 a month shortly
after the Marcoses fled here.
   One source of money is Mrs. Marcos' daughter, Irene Araneta, who
lives in Woodside, Calif., and is married to the son of a wealthy
Filipino industrialist, aides said.
   Marcos spokesman Roger Peyuan said the Marcoses have accumulated
more than $3 million in legal bills. He said the household staff of
about 30 is paid irregularly but remains loyal because the Marcoses
``have helped us so much and this is when she really needs us.''
   ``It's very difficult to be a widow, to be alone for the first
time,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``I must admit that Ferdinand handled all
of this, money, business, everything like that. We led a very
compartmentalized life.''
   During the interview at her home, she appeared at times nervous,
apprehensive and lonely, wringing her hands and fidgeting, only to
turn hopeful, philosophical and reminiscent, giggling and reading
romantic inscriptions on cards from someone who signed them
``Andy.''
   She recalled her past with ``no regret.''
   ``Everything in life comes in pairs: good and bad, day and
night, yin and yang.'' she said. ``Ferdinand always said `you
cannot argue with destiny, just stay on top of it.' I'm just trying
to keep control of my life.''

   Bombs rained down on the Afghan capital
and the sound of artillery thundered through the city during the
attempt to overthrow the government, said travelers arriving
Thursday from Afghanistan.
   The Ariana Airlines plane was the first international flight to
leave Kabul airport since the attempt to overthrow President Najib
was launched Tuesday. Some passengers said that considering the
ferocity of the attack, civilian casualties appeared low.
   State-owned Radio Kabul said Thursday night 56 people were
killed and 200 injured since Tuesday.
   Many of the 150 passengers on the jet had been scheduled to
leave Kabul on Tuesday but had their plans changed by the coup
attempt, which began with an air raid on the international airport.
   ``Four jets began bombing the airport just before we were to
leave. We grabbed our hand luggage and ran,'' said Ashok Patel, an
Indian businessman. ``We walked for about 12 kilometers (8 miles)
and sucked icicles to quench our thirst,'' he said. ``There were no
taxis after the attack and none the next day either.''
   Three people working with the International Committee of the Red
Cross were among the travelers. They refused to give their names
and nationalities but said casualties were not as high as might
have been expected.
   ``In fact, we, as Westerners, were quite amazed at the normalcy
while there was, quite obviously, a coup going on,'' one said.
   Other travelers spoke of repeated explosions, the boom of
artillery and people fleeing from the streets into the relative
safety of houses and cellars.
   ``I was very scared,'' said Harinder Singh, an Afghan whose
ancestors were Sikhs from India. ``All of us thought we were going
to die. A bomb exploded in a taxi near me and I saw the driver
being blown apart.''
   Singh said he walked from the airport back to the city Tuesday
and spent the next day worrying about his luggage, which had
already been checked onto the plane.
   ``But there was a curfew and I couldn't do anything about it.
And when I heard there was flight today (Thursday), I just got
on,'' he said. ``I'll check about the luggage later.''

   Two environmental groups filed suit Thursday
seeking to force the new Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board to
hold public meetings.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Research
Foundation are seeking an injunction to prevent the new panel from
holding meetings unless it ends a policy of closing its sessions.
   The failure of a government agency to meet in public violates
the Government in the Sunshine Act and the Freedom of Information
act, the groups contend.
   The five-member safety board was formed in 1988 to look into
allegations of problems at nuclear weapons production facilities.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia.

<HEAD>Malcolm Forbes Touted Good Health on Day Before He Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm Forbes touted his good health on the day
before he died and said his philosophy was to ``live while you are
alive,'' according to a British magazine published Thursday.
   Hello! magazine published what is said was Forbes' last
interview before he died at the age of 70 in his sleep Feb. 24 at
his New Jersey home.
   ``I don't think this life is for hibernating and getting ready
for the next one. I think you are given it for a purpose and that
is to live it. Live while you are alive!'' Forbes was quoted as
saying.
   Forbes spoke enthusiastically about his next adventure to Brazil
in a hot air balloon during the interview at his South London home
on Feb. 23, and about his love of motorcycles.
   ``I am very lucky to have the health to do all this because that
you can't buy,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``I would just like to stay around a while and keep doing more
of the things I am doing!'' Forbes was quoted as saying.
   The magazine included seven color photographs of Forbes in his
London house and earlier pictures from Forbes' 70th birthday bash
in August in Morocco.
   Asked what money has brought that Forbes most values, he was
quoted as saying: ``The growth of the business which has enlisted
all my sons with their enthusiasms and abilities. Success is being
able to do what turns you on, and we have great fun together.''
   Forbes' son, Malcolm Jr., succeeded him as editor in chief of
Forbes magazine and chief executive officer of Forbes Inc. magazine.
   In the interview, the elder Forbes was quoted as saying: ``All
that happens when you have money is that it gets fatter and you
have to spend twice as much to thin it down!
   ``Similarly, your capacity for joy or pain is no greater but the
costs can be higher. Capacity to enjoy life is not multiplied. It
is mostly in the attitude. I am not talking about the grindingness
of poverty but for the normal person the attitude, not the money,
determines the joy.''

   Jury selection began Thursday in the
second trial against Paul Newman for a share of the profits from
the actor's salad dressing.
   A mistrial was declared the first time around on a lawsuit by
Westport delicatessen owner, Julius Gold who claims he was promised
8 percent of the stock for consulting services when Newman's
company was begun in 1982.
   Newman's Own makes salad dressing, spaghetti sauce, popcorn and
lemonade. The actor says all profits go to charity.

   Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son,
said Thursday he is going to hoof it on March 26, and he urged
other Londoners to walk home from work and give their saved fares
to help the homeless.
   ``I'll be walking home,'' said Edward, who usually drives the
less than a mile from Buckingham Palace to the Palace Theater,
where he is a production assistant with Andrew Lloyd Webber's
Really Useful Company.
   The ``Feet First'' campaign hopes to raise $164,000 for
charities working with homeless young people in central London.
   The prince, who turns 26 on Saturday, said he has talked with
homeless young people.
   ``It is well worth remembering that no one is homeless by
choice. No one chooses to sleep rough night after night or to beg.''
   Edward said huge increases in housing prices are a factor in the
rising number of homeless.
   Buckingham Palace said the prince will either walk to work on
March 26 or be dropped off if he has an official engagement before
he goes to the office.

   An ex-girlfriend of actor William Hurt is
appealing the decision that she and Hurt did not have a common-law
marriage.
   ``Hurt told her, `We're more married than married people. We're
married in the eyes of God,''' A. Richard Golub, the lawyer for
Sandra Jennings, told an appeals court Wednesday.
   Golub said the judge who ruled against a common-law marriage
barred documents and testimony that would have proved Hurt a liar.
   Golub apologized for having said, right after the decision was
issued last year, that Judge Jacqueline Silbermann ``was in love
with Bill Hurt.''
   ``It was a hotly contested case. I lost my temper. I shot my
mouth off. I apologize to the court,'' Golub told the appellate
panel.
   But outside the appeals courtroom, Jennings said that in a
pretrial conference last year in the judge's chambers, Silbermann
told Hurt, ``Oh! You're my favorite actor.''
   Jennings, 33, a former ballerina, said Slibermann denied her
request for another judge.
   Jennings' claim that a common-law marriage existed is based on
the statutes of South Carolina, where she and Hurt lived for a few
months while he filmed ``The Big Chill.''

   Soul singer James Brown is being
considered for two jobs outside the prison where he is serving six
years for aggravated assault and failing to stop for police.
   Neither job has anything to do with music, but they are Brown's
two top choices for the State Department of Corrrections'
work-release program, said Brown's attorney Richard Crane. Crane
didn't say what the jobs were.
   Brown, 56, serving his sentence in State Park Correctional
Center, earned work-release approval last month.
   The program would require Brown to stay overnight in a state
center after returning from a daytime job.
   Corrections spokesman Bennish Brown said there are no center
beds available, and he could not confirm a statement by Crane that
one would become available April 1.
   ``No dates have been firmed up,'' the spokesman said. ``I've
been assured that we're still considering different jobs and still
waiting on space at centers.''
   The singer becomes eligible for parole May 5, 1991.

   Ted Koppel doesn't pull his punches on the
subject of fallen TV evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   They're con artists, said the ABC-TV moderator of ``Nightline.''
   When asked by NBC's Bob Costas if he was suprised that the fall
of the Bakkers gave his show its highest ever rating, Koppel said
no.
   ``Quite the contrary,'' he said on ``Later with Bob Costas,'' to
be broadcast March 21. ``It had sex, it had money, it had religion,
it had duplicity, it had enormous public interest all the way
through.''
   Did he feel compassion for the couple? Costas asked.
   ``Not once we were on the air,'' said Koppel. ``I was much more
concerned about the people who had given their trust and faith to
Jim and Tammy. ... But they really are, they're a couple of shills.
He's a con man and she's a con woman.''

<HEAD>Opposition Stages Hunger Strike, Government Negotiates on TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mongolia's prime minister on Thursday held
inconclusive talks on live television with opposition leaders and
hunger strikers demanding a multiparty system, foreign sources in
Ulan Bator said.
   Prime Minister Dumaagiyn Sodnom met with 30 to 40
representatives from five unofficial political groups, including
several hunger strikers, but the televised debate broke off after
90 minutes, a source said.
   He said the hunger strikers are continuing their protest.
   About 10 members of Mongolia's infant opposition groups started
the hunger strike Wednesday after the government failed to respond
to their demands for reforms that were outlined in a petition
delivered Sunday, sources said.
   The petition, signed by the Mongolian Democratic Union and three
other unofficial political groups, calls for the Communist Party to
give up its monopoly on power and hold new parliamenmtary elections.
   Also Wednesday, the ruling Communist Party said it would hold a
meeting Monday, but did not say what would be on the agenda.
Sources speculated the leadership might meet some of the
opposition's demands.
   Long a Soviet ally, Mongolia began experimenting with reforms
less than two years ago, but the 3-month-old opposition movement
says measures are too slow.
   The hunger strikers, mostly men in their 20s, slept in sleeping
bags in the square Wednesday night with no shelter from the below
freezing temperatures. Two ambulances stood nearby, the sources
said.
   Throughout the day, representatives from some half-dozen
unofficial political groups gave speeches in the square, while
supporters signed their names on a long roll of paper, the sources
said.
   ``It's all very orderly and peaceful. There are a lot of people
with baby carriages,'' one source said.
   He said there were no police or soldiers, even though public
rallies are banned at the square and several other major sites in
Ulan Bator.
   Mongolia is a vast, pastoral country of 2 million people.

   The U.S. Armed Forces affixed new ribbons
to their flags Thursday to mark the Panama invasion, which
President Bush said had joined `'the roll call of glory, the roster
of great American campaigns.''
   He listed: ``Yorktown, Gettysburg, Normandy, and now Panama.''
   Bush said the new streamers were ``most of all'' for the 23
soldiers killed in the invasion, which ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   At the ceremony, Bush joined top generals and admirals in a
darkened hall where spotlights played on nearly 200 soldiers,
sailors, airmen and Marines standing at attention, bearing
bayonets, rifles and the flag of each state and territory.
   The honors began with the roar of a 21-gun salute from cannons
outside the Ceremonial Hall that doubles as the base gymnasium.
   It ended with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, in colonial
garb, marching off after the Army Band played the anthems of all
four services.
   ``We're here today to add another campaign streamer to the roll
call of glory, the roster of great American campaigns _ Yorktown,
Gettysburg, Normandy and now Panama,'' said Bush.
   The flag honors those ``who died in the defense of liberty ...
and that is why I am determined that the American flag will be
consecrated, not desecrated,'' said Bush, who supports the idea of
a constitutional amendment to make flag-burning illegal.
   The flags borne by an honor guard from the Army, the Navy, the
Air Force and the Marines already carry dozens of multicolored
streamers, each signifying a different war or engagement, from the
Revolutionary War to the Civil War to Vietnam and Grenada.
   The Panama campaign streamer was the 169th ribbon affixed to the
Army flag; the 13th for the Marine flag; the 19th for the Navy and
the 78th for the Air Force.
   ``Panama was another chapter in a great epic, an act of free men
and women in the Revolution of '89, a revolution that also swept
the East and is now sweeping the globe,'' said Bush.
   ``The revolution continues. The people have spoken in Nicaragua.
When they speak in Cuba and Haiti, our Western hemisphere will be
entirely within the compass of freedom,'' he said.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said, ``With the presentation of these streamers, the campaign in
Panama is now part of the glorious tradition of our nation and its
armed forces.''
   ``For as long as the Stars and Stripes flies over this nation,
the actions of the men and women who helped to restore democracy to
Panama ... will be remembered,'' said Powell.

<HEAD>Gov't Says Anti-Apartheid Activists Prompting Homeland Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid activists are
behind an outbreak of violence in tribal homelands because they
don't want to negotiate, the government suggested Thursday.
   ``The violence is certainly part of an overall plan to
destabilize the country and make it difficult to commence
negotiations,'' said Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit
Viljoen.
   ``It is quite clear that certain elements pretend to be keen on
participating in negotiating reform, but are in effect not ready to
do so,'' he said, apparently referring to the African National
Congress and other leading black groups,
   ``They have been caught on the wrong foot by the initiatives of
the state president,'' Viljoen said.
   ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan in Lusaka, Zambia denied that the
recently legalized organization was behind the violence, which has
led to 200 deaths in the past month, according to Business Day
newspaper in Johannesburg.
   He said tension had been building in some of the 10 homelands,
which the apartheid system has designated as the national states
where the black majority of 28 million can own land and exercise
political rights.
   ``The language of violence, looting and arson reveals the
bitterness in the hearts of many of our people, but it is senseless
and savage in the extreme,'' said the Rev. Stanley Mogoba,
president of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and a
prominent black anti-apartheid activist.
   ``There may be leaders and groups who are encouraging this type
of behavior,'' he said. If true, ``then I must brand these adults
cowards who do not have the interests of our nation at heart,''
Mogoba said.
   Homeland army troops fired automatic rifles, shotguns, rubber
bullets and tear gas at protesters and used whips to disperse
crowds in Bophuthatswana, where demonstrators are demanding that
the nominally independent Tswana republic be re-incorporated into
South Africa.
   Soldiers and police in armored personnel carriers and trucks
randomly opened fire with assault rifles to stop crowds forming in
the Garankuwa area, witnesses said.
   Youths erected barricades of burned out vehicles to block
streets, but were chased away by soldiers and police who tore down
the barriers, eyewitnesses said. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
   Viljoen, the Cabinet minister in charge of beginning
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution and an end to
apartheid, made his accusation at a Cape Town news conference.
   With him was Hudson Ntsanwisi, leader of the Gazankulu homeland,
which shares a border with Kruger Park, the nation's largest
wildlife reserve.
   After a meeting with President F.W. de Klerk, Ntsanwisi was
granted national police personnel and equipment to help quell a
three-week work stoppage that has closed government offices,
schools, businesses and shops in Gazankulu, homeland of the
Shangaan people. Black workers at the nearby Kruger Park's main
camp went on strike Thursday.
   At least 25 people have been killed and more than 200 huts
burned in the past two weeks in the homeland, where activists are
demanding Ntsanwisi's ouster.
   De Klerk accused unspecified groups of ``making mischief,'' and
when Foreign Minister Pik Botha was asked Wednesday night if the
ANC was involved, he said the government had no proof.
   But Viljoen's comments were interpreted by local newspapers, and
by the ANC, as referring to the organization which de Klerk
legalized Feb. 2.
   ANC affiliates in Johannesburg issued a statement Thursday
deploring violence in the township of Katlehong, 15 miles to the
southeast, and sent teams to arrange peace talks between warring
factions.
   A black man was hacked with knives, and a woman was shot
Thursday, police said. Five houses and nine vehicles were burned.
Up to 70 people were injured early Thursday, the independent South
African Press Association said.
   In another development, lawyers for more than 340 prisoners on
Robben Island in Cape Town said their clients had ended a two-week
hunger strike. The lawyers said the government is considering the
prisoners' demands to be granted political status and ultimately
freedom.

   The ministerial council of the Arab League
will meet Saturday to discuss the question of moving the 22-member
organization back to Cairo, Arab diplomats said.
   The headquarters of the regional organization was transferred to
the Tunisian capital from Cairo in 1979 after Egypt signed the Camp
David accords with Israel.
   The council, made up of the foreign ministers or permanent
representatives of the member countries, does not have the power to
make the transfer decision. Only a full Arab summit can do so.
Inter-Arab squabbles have prevented the holding of a regular,
non-emergency Arab summit since 1983.
   The Tunisian government has said it wouldn't oppose the return
of the Arab League headquarters to Cairo if an Arab summit so
decides.

<HEAD>Evangelist Brings Crusade to Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Billy Graham is bringing his crusade
for Christianity to the Berlin Wall to fill the spiritual void left
by retreating communism, the U.S. evangelist and German religious
leaders said Thursday.
   Graham said the sweeping events of Eastern Europe have lessened
the danger of nuclear confrontation, but that in its place have
appeared threats of ``hedonism, materialism and
self-gratification.''
   At a news conference to discuss his Saturday evangelical meeting
at the Berlin Wall, Graham said many people who were repressed
under communism were ready to heed his message.
   ``A few weeks ago President (Vaclav) Havel of Czechoslovakia in
an address to the United States Congress declared that the
salvation of the world lies not in slick political slogans about
freedom and democracy but rather in the human heart. I agree with
that,'' Graham said.
   Graham said he accepted an invitation from religious leaders in
both Germanys to address a gathering Saturday because ``I felt
Germany was on the verge of a spiritual awakening.''
   Hartmut Stepp, a West German evangelical church leader from
Stuttgart, said Graham's ministry was sought at this time because
``a spiritual, ideological vacuum exists because of this social
upheaval.''
   Graham's crusade comes just a week before East Germans go to the
polls for their first-ever free elections, which will seat a new
parliament and set the nation on the road to reunification with
West Germany.
   Graham, said the date for his appearance was set when the East
German vote was planned for May 6. The election had to be advanced
because of the swiftly worsening economic and political situation
in East Germany.
   ``I don't want to say anything to indicate which side I'm on,
because I must be politically neutral,'' Graham replied when asked
how his Christian crusade might affect the elections.
   The East German Christian Democratic Union, aligned with the
Christian Democratic Union of West Germany that is headed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has been emphasizing its religious roots in
the campaign. But the party trails the Social Democrats, who are
predicted to win a majority of seats in the parliamentary elections.
   Posters announcing the crusade call on Germans on both sides of
the wall to ``listen to the man whose message can give meaning to
life: Billy Graham.''
   Graham, 71, has conducted eight previous evangelical crusades in
Germany, the first in 1954 when much of the nation still lay in
ruins. Tens of thousands of West Germans attended those gatherings.
   He has also preached in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania,
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Old-Guard Communists Admit Losing Effort to Keep Party Character</HEAD>

   Old-guard Italian Communists acknowledged
Thursday they were fighting a losing battle to save the traditional
identity of their party, its name and symbols.
   Party leader Achille Occhetto has all the votes he needs at the
extraordinary congress of the Italian Communist Party to guarantee
the success of his proposal to revamp the party, a move expected to
lead to changing its name and eliminating its hammer-and-sickle
symbol.
   ``It is true, 65 percent of the votes in the congress are in his
favor,'' said Armando Cossutta, who has fought to block any reform
that could destroy the party's traditional identity.
   But he argued it was not enough just to decide what form the new
party would take, how it will be formed and who will lead it. He
said the congress should decide ``if life really must be given to a
new party.''
   ``Occhetto speaks as if it is our fault that we have not
succeeded in being in the government ... as if anti-communism
stemmed from our name and not from forces that want to keep every
prospect of change a long way from the government,'' Cossutta said
to lukewarm applause from the 1,092 delegates gathered in Bologna's
Sports Palace, awash in red for the congress that ends this weekend.
   Other old-guard Communists such as Aldo Tortorella have argued
that the West's largest Communist Party, which claims 1.4 million
members, could conduct major reforms without creating a new party.
   ``We are divided on what is a party of the left,'' said
Tortorella.
   ``For this reason, we have defended our revered symbols, our
name and our flag. It is true, this name has been muddied by
others. But they are the ones that must change it,'' he added.
   Tortorella collapsed just after he descended from the speaker's
platform on the red, multitired dais. Doctors said later that he
had fainted because he was suffering from too much stress. He was
taken to a hospital but doctors said he needed only to rest.
   Occhetto has pushed for the birth of a new party as part of an
effort to reverse the party's electoral slide and offer an
alternative to the domination of the Christian Democrats and their
allies.
   The Communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34
percent of the vote, but they dropped to about 27 percent in the
last parliamentary elections in 1987.
   ``The strongest criticism I have of the party secretary is that
he created the illusion in the body of the party and in public
opinion that with this proposal it is possible to unblock the
political situation dominated by the Christian Democrats and their
allies for 40 years,'' Cossutta said.
   ``I don't know a single Communist who doesn't want to open the
situation and who doesn't want us to be in the government,'' he
added.
   But he said the objectives could not be reached simply by
launching a new party. He said the party's electoral slide began
before the ``storm in Eastern Europe.''
   ``We lost votes among all the classes, but particularly among
the working classes, because they disagreed not with our image, but
with the substance of our political action, the uncertainty of
those years.''
   He was referring to the drift in the Communist Party since it
abandoned the ``historic compromise'' of the late 1970s, through
which it supported the Christian Democrats in return for being
consulted on major government decisions.
   ``If the problem remains one of substance, then there is no need
for us to eliminate our symbols and our name,'' said Tortorella.
   He agreed with Occhetto that unity was essential for the party,
which has been fractured by the debate over changing its identity.

   Eighteen years after applying, Soviet
molecular biologist Vladimir Raiz and his wife, Carmella, have
received permission to emigrate to Israel, a New York congressman
said Thursday.
   Raiz, who was denied an exit permit on grounds he knew state
secrets, is the longest-term Jewish refusenik in the Soviet Union.
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., said Raiz was allowed to depart
after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev interceded.
   Raiz, of Vilnius, Lithuania, was fired from his job at the
Institute of Molecular Biology after applying for an exit permit in
1972. His wife has been in Washington on a tourist visa, trying to
bring pressure on Moscow. A demonstration had been scheduled
outside the Soviet embassy.
   Mrs. Raiz also was dismissed from her job as first violinist of
the Vilna Philharmoic Orchestra. They have two sons, Moshe, 12, and
Shaul, 8, and are observant Jews.
   The Raizes organized seminars on Jewish culture, religion,
modern Israel and Hebrew while seeking permission to leave the
Soviet Union.
   According to Gilman, the first secretary of the Lithuanian
Communist Party, Algirdis Brezauskas, lodged an appeal for the
family with Gorbachev and permission to emigrate to Israel was
granted soon afterward.
   Gilman and Rabbi Ronald Greenwald of Monsey, N.Y., had
approached the Lithuanian party official earlier. The State
Department also interceded.
   Mrs. Raiz met with President Bush at the White House last
December.
   Gilman said Albert Reichmann, a Toronto builder whose family
supports various Jewish causes, would go to Lithuania to meet Raiz
and accompany him to Israel.
   ``Freedom has finally been granted to this most deserving,
courageous family,'' Gilman said in a statement. ``Their courage
has been an inspiration to many for the past 18 years, and their
new-found freedom is heartening for all.''
   The congressman said the visas would be issued next Tuesday. The
children also were granted permission to depart.

<HEAD>Bill Introduced to Prosecute Suspected Nazi War Criminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday introduced legislation
to enable prosecutors to charge three aging emigres as Nazi war
criminals, and police said they probably will set up a special unit
to investigate more suspects.
   The Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center said Britain was
``finally on the threshold'' of meting out justice to the suspects
_ Eastern Europeans who fled after World War II and became
naturalized Britons.
   Government officials said they hoped the War Crimes Bill would
be passed by the summer, raising the prospect of the first trial as
early as year's end.
   But critics declared the bill was a revenge measure that would
result in emotional and unfair ``show trials.''
   ``Legislating in a spirit of revenge rarely produces good,''
said governing Conservative Party lawmaker Robert Adley, a leading
critic of the government move.
   ``The idea of hounding three old men to court will either finish
up in farce or tragedy for those conducting this vendetta,'' he
added.
   The bill followed a Dec. 12 vote by the House of Commons to
accept a government-ordered inquiry that said there was sufficient
evidence to prosecute three suspects living in Britain.
   The report urged the investigation of 124 more cases of suspects
who came to Britain with thousands of displaced persons after the
end of the 1939-45 war.
   Scotland Yard, London's police headquarters, said there is ``a
likelihood of Scotland Yard investigation team'' being set up to
deal exclusively with war crime cases.
   Two eminent lawyers who conducted the inquiry for the government
said Britain must change its law to allow prosecutions of British
citizens for crimes committed abroad, or risk becoming a ``safe
haven'' for Nazis.
   Britain is the last allied country to take action. Australia and
Canada passed legislation in the past few years and are holding
their first trials, while the U.S. Justice Department investigates
and deports suspects for trial in Israel.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supports prosecutions.
   But the government will allow a ``free vote'' _ according to
conscience and not along party lines _ on the bill. The key
legislative stage, the second reading, is scheduled for March 19.
   The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, which submitted
initial lists of suspects to the British government in 1986, urged
Britain to set up a special Nazi-hunting unit similar to the U.S.
Office of Special Investigations. It includes historians and
archivists.
   ``But what is important is that the British government and the
British Parliament ... have now finally entered the threshold where
justice is about to be done in respect of Nazi war criminals,''
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the center.
   Hier estimated the first trial could begin about three months
after the bill becomes law.
   The names of the suspects were kept confidential in a separate
section of the report by the British investigators issued in July.
   But one suspect, Antanas Gecas, a Lithuanian-born retired mining
engineer who lives in Scotland, has been identified repeatedly by
the British news media.
   Gecas, 73, acknowledges serving in a notorious police battalion
in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, but says he only watched the atrocities.
   All the suspects in Britain are from Lithuania or two other
Soviet republics, Ukraine and Latvia, where locals manned mobile
death squads set up by the Nazis. The squads rounded up and
murdered tens of thousands of Jews.
   The trials would involve new rules of evidence in Britain to
allow videotaping of testimony by aging witnesses in the Soviet
Union and depositions left by witnesses who have since died.

   Israel's housing minister called for building
2,000 new apartments in the occupied West Bank this year to house
Jewish immigrants, Israel radio reported Thursday.
   The issue of settling immigrants on the disputed land has drawn
strong criticism from the United States, which argues that Israel's
settlement policy is an obstacle to peace.
   Earlier Thursday, a Jerusalem planning official disclosed the
city government has plans to build a new Jewish neighborhood in
Arab east Jerusalem despite American opposition to such a move.
   The request by Housing Minister David Levy on the West Bank
settlements, if approved by the government, could jeopardize $400
million in U.S. loan guarantees Israel requested to build housing
for an influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a congressional
subcommittee last week the administration was willing to support
such guarantees but only if it received ``assurances these funds
will not be used to create new settlements or expand old
settlements in the occupied territories.''
   Almost 500 Soviet immigrants have been arriving daily in Israel.
   The radio said Levy, long a proponent of the settlement
movement, wants 2,000 of the 30,000 new housing units planned this
year for immigrants to be built in the West Bank.
   A Finance Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Levy's proposal ``is not the policy of the
government.'' Levy could not be reached immediately for comment.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in enclaves in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The government says that about 200 Soviet
immigrants moved to the territories last year.
   Ruth Kaminker, a member of Jerusalem's nine-member City Planning
Board, told The Associated Press that the new 225-acre neighborhood
was in its ``final stages'' of planning after a three-month study
of the site.
   The development, expected to include up to 3,000 homes or
apartments, is planned for a steep slope of a strategic hill known
as Mount Homa, said Mrs. Kaminker, a member of the left-wing
Citizens' Rights Movement.
   She said the government requested development of the new
neighborhood, apparently in an attempt to strengthen Jewish hold in
the Arab sector of the city, which was annexed by Israel after its
capture from Jordan in 1967.
   City spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer denied any new neighborhood in
east Jerusalem was in the planning stages. But she acknowledged the
site was one of several under consideration in east Jerusalem for
constructing new Jewish housing.
   About 140,000 Palestinians live in Arab east Jerusalem. In the
past 23 years, 120,000 Jews have moved into seven new communities
around the Arab area.
   Most countries, including the United States, have not recognized
Israeli sovereignty over the Arab sector.
   On March 3, President Bush leveled unusual criticism at Israeli
building in disputed areas of Jerusalem.
   ``We do not believe there should be new settlements in the West
Bank or east Jerusalem,'' Bush said in California.
   Two previously announced Jewish neighborhoods are also going up
in east Jerusalem to house Soviet immigrants and a rapidly
expanding population of ultra-Orthodox Jews.
   But a city building plan for Arab neighborhoods has been stalled
for years by the Israeli government, and the initial plan for
17,000 units has been ordered cut to about 7,500.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The territories' 1.7 million Palestinian residents have waged a
27-month uprising against Israeli occupation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court challenge mounted by a suburban
Chicago savings institution could derail President Bush's savings
and loan bailout.
   Olympic Federal Savings and Loan Association, Berwyn, Ill.,
contends in U.S. District Court that the director of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision is holding his position
unconstitutionally.
   S&amp;L legislation adopted last August allowed M. Danny Wall,
chairman of the now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to serve
as thrift office director without being appointed by the president
or confirmed by the Senate.
   Wall resigned in December and was replaced temporarily this week
by Assistant Treasury Secretary Salvatore R. Martoche, who has been
confirmed for his assistant secretary post but not as thrift office
director.
   Olympic, which is trying to deflect potential seizure by the
government, contends in court papers that both Wall and Martoche
lack the legal authority to turn a thrift over to the Resolution
Trust Corp., a new agency created to sell or close failed
institutions.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth late Wednesday blocked the
thrift office from seizing Olympic for 10 days unless the agency
provides the court and the S&amp;L with six hours notice. He scheduled
a hearing for Tuesday.
   The case has wide ramifications. Over the past year, the
government has seized more than 380 S&amp;Ls in nearly 40 states and
has closed or sold 50 of those.
   More than 120 of the takeovers have occurred since the
conversion of the bank board into the thrift office. The government
is expected to seize as many as 200 additional institutions.
   Olympic, with $1.1 billion, had exhausted its tangible capital
and was deep in the hole at the end of September, according to
Sheshunoff Information Services, an Austin, Texas, consulting firm.
   An official of the biggest trade group representing S&amp;Ls urged
the Bush administration to swiftly render Olympic's legal challenge
pointless by nominating a new thrift office director.
   ``This underscores the fact that the president and the
administration have to move with great haste here to appoint a
permanent director and get the OTS moving again,'' said James H.
Grohl, senior vice president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
   An administration source said the White House has received a
recommendation from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady for a
permanent successor to Wall. The source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, would not reveal the individual's name.

<HEAD>U.S. Will Participate in Soviet Space Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, acting at the request of
the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, will participate in a
Soviet project using a large orbiting radio telescope to peer into
the core of quasars and other active galaxies, it was announced
Thursday.
   ``This is a small but significant step in the evolving
cooperation in space activities between our two nations,'' said
Vice President Dan Quayle, announcing the U.S. role at a ceremony
with Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin.
   Shortly before his death last year, Sakharov had written to
NASA's administrator, Richard Truly, asking the United States to
take part in the program, known as RADIOASTRON.
   The project calls for the Soviets to launch a 10-meter radio
telescope into Earth orbit in 1993. It will work synchronously with
U.S. ground-based telescopes to produce unprecedented resolution
for peering deep into space, the vice president's office said.
   The United States will provide precision tracking facilities for
very high accuracy measurements of the Soviet satellite orbit. In
addition, the United States will lend the Soviets data recorders
now being developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.
   ``Space is an area where, in the past, we have had competition
with the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said. ``And with the reduction of
tensions, perhaps this will be a place where we can have not
competition but cooperation.''
   Dubinin called the U.S. participation ``a good start'' toward an
era of cooperation.

   The dangerous trend of low birth-weight babies is
on the rise, especially among black infants, after a 10-year
decline, federal health officials reported Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said the rate of babies
born at less than 5{ pounds rose 2 percent from 1985 to 1987 _ the
latest year for which statistics are available. During 1975 to
1985, the rate declined by 9 percent.
   Sixty-nine of 1,000 babies born in 1987 were under 5{ pounds,
compared with 67.5 of 1,000 in 1985. The 1987 figures still
represent an improvement over the 73.9 per 1,000 reported in 1975.
   And the rate of babies at ``very low'' birth weight is rising
even faster, up 6.8 percent from 1975-87, the report said. In 1987,
12.4 per 1,000 was below 3 pounds, 4 ounces, compared with 11.6 in
1975.
   ``This rate is a small proportion of births, but it's
increasing, which makes it more difficult in the future to improve
our infant mortality rate,'' said Dr. Carol Hogue, director of the
CDC's Division of Reproductive Health.
   ``Very low birth weight'' babies, below 3 pounds, 4 ounces, are
90 to 100 times more likely to die in their first year than other
babies, she said. Infants under 5{ pounds _ ``low birth weight''
babies _ face at least a five times greater risk of death than
babies of normal weight, about 6{ to 9{ pounds.
   The problem is worse for black infants.
   ``Black babies, who already have been at greatly increased risk
of low birth weight and infant mortality, are experiencing a
greater increase in this risk than white babies,'' Hogue said.
   The rate of low birth weight among black infants is more than
twice the rate for white infants: 127.1 per 1,000 blacks in 1987,
versus 56.8 for whites. And the disparity has widened since 15
years ago, when the rates were 130.9 for blacks to 62.6 for whites.
   Low birth weight rose less than 1 percent for whites between
1985 and 1987, but 2 percent for blacks.
   ``The data,'' the CDC said, ``underscore the substantial and
persistent difference between black and white infants in the risk
for low birth weight.''
   The reasons for the black-white gap are complex, the
Atlanta-based agency said in its weekly report. Chief among them:
more black women are in high-risk groups for underweight babies _
poor, unmarried, under age 20, undereducated, or lacking proper
prenatal care.
   Other factors include poorer nutritional status, close-together
pregnancies and higher rates of unwanted births, the CDC said,
adding that infants born less than two years after a sibling run a
higher risk of low birth weight. More than 16 percent of
underweight black babies were unwanted or mistimed pregnancies, the
CDC said.
   ``The prevention of unintended pregnancies could substantially
reduce the difference in rates of low birth weight between blacks
and whites,'' the agency said.
   Hogue said improvements in the nation's infant mortality rate
during the past two decades are largely because of improved means
of keeping premature babies alive _ not because of improved infant
health.
   ``We're not sure we can continue to improve infant mortality by
improving this very expensive technology,'' she said. ``We really
need to focus on reducing the incidence of low birth weight.''
   About 3.5 million babies are born in the United States each
year. Most low birth-weight babies are premature babies; nearly six
in 10 are born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy, compared with
the standard 40 weeks. As such, low birth-weight babies run a much
greater risk of serious illness, including respiratory problems, or
death.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Asks $4.6 Billion Increase in Federal Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private advocacy group called Thursday for
$4.6 billion in new federal spending on child health and education
programs to back up the ``mostly empty rhetoric'' of President Bush
and the nation's governors.
   Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund,
applauded recent actions by the National Governors' Association and
Bush to endorse national education goals.
   But she said her group's proposal would be ``a significant step
toward translating the mostly empty rhetoric about preparing
children for school into real dollars and placing children at the
top, rather than in the margins, of the nation's agenda.''
   She commented at a news conference as her group released its
annual report on the status of children in America.
   The group proposed increases for fiscal 1991 in federal spending
on child care, the Head Start program, health and nutrition
services and child protection programs.
   Meeting the governors' goals for national education achievement
``will require far more than lofty rhetoric and token
investments,'' she said.
   Among the recommendations of the group:
   _Enactment of a comprehensive national child-care bill, costing
at least $1.75 billion, plus additional state appropriations.
   _Expanding the Head Start program, which provides educational,
nutritional and health services to needy pre-school children. It
called for $1.4 billion in additional spending on the program, plus
state supplements.
   _A $1 billion expansion in programs to protect vulnerable
children and families against abuse and neglect.
   _Additional spending in health, nutrition, immunization and
related programs, including expansion of Medicaid health care to
cover all pregnant women and children with incomes below 185
percent of the poverty level.
   She said Bush's campaign pledge to become the ``education
president'' was at odds with his proposal for a modest $500 million
increase in federal education spending. She said the increase would
not allow federal education spending to keep pace with inflation.

   Thousands of Moslems confined to mosques
and homes by a curfew vowed Thursday to die for Kashmir's
independence, shouting their slogans at top Indian politicians who
arrived to assess the situation.
   Before the curfew was imposed at 10 a.m. Moslem militants and
security forces fought prolonged gunbattles, and at least two
people were killed and 10 injured, witnesses said.
   Islamic and pro-independence slogans, broadcast continuously by
mosque loudspeakers, reverberated through this city of 1 million
people as the politicians drove from the airport to their hotel.
   The 14 leaders, belonging to major political parties, traveled
the 9-mile route in a convoy of 40 cars escorted by paramilitary
troops in trucks mounted with machine guns.
   ``The slogan of the faith, Allah is great!'' thousands shouted
from within the mosques as the convoy drove past at noon.
   ``We want independence!'' they also chanted.
   The politicians, including former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
and Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, were refused permission to
leave their heavily guarded hotel.
   Security forces strictly enforced the curfew, but the broadcasts
continued. Many speeches urged Moslems to sacrifice their lives for
Kashmir's independence.
   At least 173 people have been killed since Jan. 20 when the
government launched a crackdown on Moslem militants who demand
secession of the predominantly Moslem Jammu-Kashmir state from
mostly Hindu India.
   ``I am shocked. If there is no political solution I see some
very hard options ahead,'' Gandhi said at the luxury Centaur Hotel
on the edge of Dal Lake. ``I do not want to define them.''
   Disenchantment with the government was ``incredible,'' he said,
while at least 1,000 commandos and paramilitary police patrolled
the lake and gardens surrounding the hotel.
   Gandhi said state Gov. Jagmohan refused to permit the delegation
to visit residents of Srinagar, Jammu-Kashmir's largest city and
the center of the secessionist campaign.
   Jagmohan took charge as the state's governor Jan. 18 and ordered
the crackdown.
   He said allowing Gandhi and the other leaders to go out would
have created a ``tremendous security risk.''
   Jagmohan later allowed a delegation of about 40 residents to
meet Gandhi at his hotel, a police official said.
   The meeting became unruly, however, and Gandhi was forced to
leave as the group shouted slogans blaming his 1984-89 government
for the strife in Kashmir.
   Jagmohan said the curfew will be relaxed Friday after the
politicians leave Srinagar.
   When the curfew was lifted from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m., exchanges of
gunfire began, witnesses said.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu, said Moslem snipers fired at paramilitary
police at four places during the curfew relaxation, but said he had
no details of casualties.
   Witnesses said they heard firing from at least a half-dozen
areas in downtown Srinagar.
   Militants were firing from rooftops and pinning down
paramilitary troops in roadside bunkers, and the soldiers returned
fire sporadically, according to the witnesses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It was like a battlefield,'' one said by telephone. ``I have
never heard firing like this before.''
   At least two people were killed and 10 injured, according to
information gathered from witnesses in several parts of the city.
   Federal Law Minister Dinesh Goswami, a member of the political
delegation, said the ``Kashmir situation today is very serious.
This problem must be dealt with at a national level.''
   Asked if the government was planning talks with the militants,
he said: ``You can have talks in an atmosphere of peace.''
   The militants have in the past rejected negotiations with the
government, saying they won't compromise.
   The campaign for an independent Kashmir, simmering since 1948,
has flared up in recent months with the consolidation of militant
groups.
   India has accused Pakistan of fomenting the trouble, a charge
that Pakistan repeatedly denies.
   The two countries have gone to war three times since their
independence from Britain in 1947 _ twice over Kashmir. A
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire line separates Kashmir into Indian and
Pakistani areas.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslem.
Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of the 880 million
population and Hindus account for 82 percent.

   Authorities say a police officer lied
about a shooting incident last year and they are investigating
another case in which the officer said a woman fired at him.
   Officer Vincent Aiello reported that suspects fired at him
during a chase of a car that ran a red light last March. But
authorities say Aiello fired into his police cruiser, using a gun
he found in the car after the occupants fled.
   Aiello, 30, was charged with offical misconduct, obstruction of
justice and false incrimination, acting Bergen County Prosecutor
John G. Holl said Wednesday.
   Aiello resigned from the police force Tuesday night and admitted
himself into a hospital for psychiatric evaluation, authorities
said. Holl said Aiello will be arraigned after his release.
   ``He was also suspended,'' said Police Chief Lars Oyen. ``I
didn't know if I could accept a resignation from someone in his
state of mind.''
   Aiello last year said he chased two men in a car from this
Bergen County community south to Jersey City, where the suspects'
car crashed and the men fled. Aiello said the men fired at him.
   Mark Lovette, who was arrested Feb. 7 and charged with attempted
murder and other charges in connection with the shooting, was
released Tuesday after police determined Aiello used Lovette's gun
to shoot at the police car.
   Holl said police are investigating a Jan. 11 incident in which
Aiello said he was shot by a woman whose car was stopped on the
highway. One shot grazed him and another hit him in the chest, but
he was wearing a bulletproof vest and was only bruised.
   The official misconduct charge carries a maximum 10-year prison
sentence upon conviction and the obstruction and false
incrimination carry 18-month terms.

<HEAD>North Sea Clean-up Conference Ends with Britain Isolated on Key
Points</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nine-nation conference on North
Sea pollution ended Thursday with agreement on lowering dangerous
emissions, but left some countries angry with Britain's stand on
sewage dumping and under-sea nuclear waste storage.
   The coastal states pledged to reduce emissions of mercury, lead,
cadmium and dioxins by 70 percent in 1995 and to phase out by
decade's end PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, believed to be
among the most hazardous materials made by man.
   In a grudging concession to Britain, the dumping of sewage
sludge will be allowed until 1998, while British industry will be
allowed to dump until 1993 an annual 205,000 to 270,000 tons of
industrial waste into the North Sea, one of the world's most
contaminated saltwater bodies.
   ``We were very disappointed that the United Kingdom could not
follow us on this point,'' said Hanja Maij-Weggen, the Dutch
transport minister and conference chairman. ``We hope the British
will be more flexible the next time.''
   British Environment Secretary Chris Patten also refused to rule
out Britain's storing nuclear waste under the seabed.
   Danish Environment Minister Lone Dybkjaer said the conference
ended in a ``furious row'' on this issue, and he accused Britain of
``betraying the lives of future generations.''
   The two-day conference was the third in a series that began in
1984 in the West German port of Bremen. A follow-up meeting was
held in London in 1987.
   Participants were the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Britain,
West Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as well as
the European Commission, the EEC's executive body. Ten other
nations, among them East Germany and Czechoslovakia, had observer
status.
   ``It was a very, very tough conference and the results don't go
far enough for us,'' particularly in the field of sewage treatment,
said West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer.
   ``But we signed the final document because it will bring us a
step further in the international field,'' Toepfer told reporters
here.
   On Wednesday, Britain underwent a barrage of criticism because
of its failure to meet the 1990 deadline for halting sea dumpings
of industrial waste, as had been agreed on in London in 1987.
   The British contend they need time to convert their industrial
plant to land-based waste treatment. They also claim that most of
the waste is not hazardous to the marine environment anyway.
   During extremely tough negotiations Thursday, Patten refused to
budge on the issue, conference sources said.
   On the question of nitrates and phosphates, the cause of massive
blooms of algae along the North Sea's coast, the conference decided
to stick to its 1987 pledge to cut in half emissions of those
substances by 1995.

<HEAD>Major Industrial Nations to Discuss Currency Swings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top finance officials from the world's seven
largest industrial countries will meet in Paris early next month to
discuss turbulence in global currency markets and dramatic
developments in Eastern Europe, officials confirmed Thursday.
   The special talks involving the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada were seen as an effort
to strengthen economic coordination between the major industrial
countries at a time of dramatic change in world affairs.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was instrumental in
scheduling the meeting, insisted that there was no ``special
urgency'' for the gathering of finance ministers and central bank
presidents of the seven countries. The talks are scheduled for
April 7.
   However, the discussions will occur just one month before these
same officials were scheduled to meet for a regular economic review
session in conjunction with the spring meeting of the International
Monetary Fund in Washington.
   Currency markets have been especially volatile in recent weeks
with the West German mark and the Japanese yen falling in price
while the U.S. dollar has strengthened in value.
   Private economists predicted that the dollar's strength and the
corresponding weakness of the yen and the mark would be a key topic
of discussion at the meeting.
   Analysts said that the rising dollar threatened to worsen an
already huge American trade deficit by making foreign products less
expensive for U.S. consumers while making American goods more
expensive on overseas markets.
   ``The dollar's strength is of great concern to the
administration,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co. ``It constitutes a recession threat because it is a further
risk to an already beleaguered industrial side of the U.S.
economy.''
   The dollar's advance has occurred despite coordinated
intervention by the United States and other governments to sell
dollars on foreign exchange markets and buy other currencies.
   Some analysts suggested that since government intervention has
proved largely unsuccessful, the G-7 officials might discuss
coordinated changes in interest rates.
   Higher interest rates in Japan and West Germany would tend to
bolster their currencies while lower interest rates in the United
States would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.

<HEAD>Blue Mooners Crying in Beer After Losing Landmark Status</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Blue Moon tavern doesn't qualify as a
cultural landmark, and hundreds of long-time patrons are left
crying in their beer.
   The 56-year-old tavern's lease runs out in four years and, after
that, landowner Westlake Capital Corp. plans to tear it down and
build a six-story housing and shopping development, spokesman
Robert Hannah told the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board on
Wednesday night.
   When the eight members of the 11-person board present were
evenly divided on whether to grant landmark status, dozens of
tavern supporters sporting Blue Moon stickers let out a collective
groan. The proposal needed six votes to pass.
   The Forever Blue Moon Committee pushed for landmark status as
the only way to save the establishment from the wrecking ball.
   ``What the landmarks board has effectively done is say it will
not designate any cultural landmarks in Seattle,'' said Walt
Crowley, a television commentator and former mayoral aide who
helped organize the 1,500-member committee.
   ``If the Blue Moon does not qualify I cannot imagine what
could,'' Crowley said.
   One patron, John Foss, said the Blue Moon ``is the one spot in
town where all these groups of people can come in and speak
together.''
   ``I went in and sat down at a table last Sunday night,'' he
said. ``There were five of us, and none of us knew each other. We
ended up speaking on everything from rap music to skiing and urban
aesthetics.''
   Board member Don Brubeck argued that Seattle has many historic
taverns, and though the Blue Moon reportedly has quenched the
thirst of such luminaries as Jack Kerouac, Dylan Thomas and
Pulitzer-Prize winner Theodore Roethke, it doesn't qualify as a
landmark.
   ``There are some really nice taverns in this city,'' Brubeck
said. ``They've been there a long time, and they have a lot of
physical integrity. ... If we designate this one, why not all the
others?''
   The tavern was among the first in Seattle to open after
prohibition, just outside the one-mile limit around the University
of Washington where sales of alcoholic beverages were banned.
   Its worn wooden booths bear years of carvings and graffiti. Its
walls are plastered with postcards, handbills, road maps and
business cards. One wall features the original tavern sign, with
its 1930's vintage bathing beauty perched atop a blue crescent moon.
   A replica of the sign hangs outside today, and supporters say
that alone makes it recognizable as the bar where David Wagoner
wrote poetry in a back booth, and Jack Leahy wrote outlines for his
short stories.
   Board member Horace Foxall likened the Blue Moon to a sort of
university with taps, a place where for decades Seattle residents
have met and exchanged ideas. Seattle, he said, is running out of
the old taverns that marked it as a port town.
   ``This is about Seattle history,'' he told other board members.
``This is it, this is what we're preserving.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Guatemala's Opium Production Merits Drug Watch List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman criticized the State Department
Thursday for not counting Guatemala, an opium producer, among the
countries that must be investigated before receiving American aid.
   ``Why wasn't it on the list?'' Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.,
chairman of a House Foreign Affairs task force on narcotics asked
Melvyn Levitsky, the assistant secretary of State for international
narcotics.
   ``Your figures indicate they produced 14 tons of opium,'' Smith
said.
   Guatemala was not on the certification list in its International
Narcotics Control Strategy Report presented to Congress last week.
   The law requires that the president certify that major drug
producing and drug transit countries have ``cooperated fully'' with
the United States in anti-drug efforts before they can receive U.S.
aid.
   Nations that produce more than 5 metric tons of opium must be
included on the list as major producers.
   But Levitsky said information about Guatemala's opium production
was received after the report was prepared in late 1989.
   ``There is always an excuse,'' Smith retorted.
   U.S. officials say Guatemala is taking steps to fight its drug
production problem.
   ``The government of Guatemala recognizes the country's potential
as a significant source of opium and took steps in 1989 to reduce
opium production through an aerial eradication program supported by
the U.S.,'' the strategy report said.
   Guatemala is also a leading transit country in Central America
for cocaine sent from Colombia to the United States, according to
David L. Westrate, assistant administrator for operations at the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The United States withdrew its ambassador from Guatemala this
week because officials said President Vinicio Cerezo had failed to
contain an upsurge of assassinations believed to be the work of
right-wing extremists.
   In another development, Smith joined administration officials in
criticizing Cuba for refusing to cooperate with the United States
on drug interdiction efforts.
   Recounting the story of a plane suspected of carrying drugs that
was lost by U.S. radar over Cuba, Smith said: ``So much for (Cuban
President Fidel) Castro's representations about wanting to help.''
   The department's report said, ``Cuba ... has failed to respond
to several U.S. requests about the seriousness of Cuba's commitment
to fighting drug trafficking.''

<HEAD>Emergency U.S. Food Aid Continued to Sudan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is continuing
emergency food shipments to Sudan even while phasing out some other
programs in the military-run African country.
   It was not clear if military aid would be suspended.
   A congressional provision forced the phasing out of economic
assistance. Sudan had eight months under the law to reverse a
military takeover but the deadline passed Feb. 28.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said Thursday
that military sales also were prohibited but that food aid and
voluntary programs were continued.
   Congressional sources said, meanwhile, that the administration
has provided Sudan with $25 million a year in military help through
other programs.
   Military officers overthrew Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's
civilian regime June 30, saying multiparty democracy had failed to
end a long civil war or save the country's shattered economy.
   Over the last two years, the United States was to provide Sudan
with $23.6 million in food and transportation costs to get the food
to the hungry. But much of it has not reached its destination
because of sabotage and diversion.
   Thousands of Sudanese have starved as food is caught up in the
war between the Khartoum government and leftist rebels in the south.
   In the meantime, Sudan has not repaid low-interest loans from
the United States. This led to suspension under another
congressional provision of $21.4 million in economic assistance
this year.
   Apart from emergency food shipments, a few projects will be
continued, including one to assist in building roads.
   A congressional source, demanding anonymity, said the Bush
administration was determined to keep military help going to Sudan.
``They've been doing an end run around Congress,'' he said.
   In power eight months, Sudan's National Salvation Revolution has
done little to revive a collapsing economy or end a debilitating
civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and threatens more
with starvation.
   The war pits the military government against The Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which launched a rebellion in 1983.
   The largest country in Africa, Sudan once was considered a
potential bread basket for the region.

<HEAD>Ice Makes Midwest a Skating Rink, Snow Still Immobilizes Part of
Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that staggered the Rockies with snow sealed parts of the
Midwest inside a thick layer of ice Thursday, pulling down power
lines that served more than 90,000 customers in Des Moines, Iowa,
and turning roads into skating rinks.
   Some major Wyoming highways remained closed a third day by deep
snow, idling travelers in motels, restaurants, truck stops and
shelters, although temperatures rose above freezing.
   Hundreds of schools were closed because ice or snow made travel
hazardous, or because of lack of electricity.
   South of the snow and ice belt, up to 7 inches of rain fell
overnight and flooded parts of Arkansas, forcing evacuation of some
homes in Little Rock. A school bus was swept off a flooded road and
into a ditch; its young passengers were evacuated without injury by
boat.
   But the rain also soaked into drought-parched fields in southern
Nebraska.
   Freezing rain during the night brought down tree branches and
power lines across wide sections of Nebraska, South Dakota,
Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   Des Moines was hardest hit, with nearly 60 percent of customers
in the metropolitan area blacked out. Police said nearly every
street in the city was closed or partially closed at some point by
downed lines or fallen limbs.
   Des Moines received more than 2 inches of precipitation in the
24 hours before 6 a.m., and state Climatologist Harry Hillaker
estimated that about half of it was frozen rain.
   ``I stepped outside last night in a safe place, no power lines
or trees nearby, just to hear all the trees snapping off,''
Hillaker said. ``I thought, `I've got to experience this. It may
not be like this ever again.''' He said he took his 7-year-old
daughter along but she became frightened within a minute.
   A utility company spokesman said people without service should
expect another night in the dark and that some areas might not have
service until Sunday.
   Des Moines schools closed for the first time this winter, as did
schools and day cares in most suburbs. Drake University called off
classes when the campus lost all power Wednesday night.
   ``We've got 1,700 kids living on campus with no electricity or
phones,'' said university spokesman Gary Bonnett. ``Imagine the
food problems. This morning they fed 'em cereal and bananas.''
   Iowa Power spokesman John McCarroll said at least 90,000
customers did not have service by Thursday morning, but president
Lynn Vorbrich said that number was trimmed to 75,000 by mid-day.
   Other utilities across the state reported scattered outages, as
did utilities in South Dakota and Nebraska.
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared 11 central Iowa counties disaster
areas, making them eligible for National Guard and Transportation
Department assistance.
   Minnesota hospitals reported treating several people who had
fallen on slippery sidewalks. In northeastern Minnesota, a pileup
involving 20 to 30 vehicles forced the temporary closing of U.S.
169 near Calumet.
   WCCO-AM in Minneapolis, whose signal covers much of the upper
Midwest and on many winter mornings broadcasts lists of school
closings, said it received reports of nearly 160 closings Thursday
in Minnesota, and more in western Wisconsin.
   Temperatures leaped above freezing Thursday across the
southeastern quarter of Wyoming, largely shut down since the storm
dumped heavy snow Tuesday, with 19 inches at the capital, Cheyenne.
But about 220 miles of interstate highways remained closed for the
third straight day.
   The Wyoming highway patrol opened one westbound lane of
Interstate 80 from Cheyenne to Laramie at mid-morning. But
dispatcher Gary Gonzalez couldn't offer a guess on when the rest of
I-80 might be reopened between Cheyenne and Laramie or I-25 from
Cheyenne north to Wheatland.
   At Denver, officials of the Regional Transportation District
said the public transit system was back on a full schedule. Many
schools in northern Colorado remained closed.
   U.S. 287 north of Fort Collins, Colo., to the Wyoming line
reopened Thursday, the last major northern Colorado highway to
remain closed after the blizzard dumped more than 4 feet of snow on
some parts of the Front Range.

   Richard Nixon, whose political career began in
Congress, came back to Capitol Hill on Thursday to dispense
geopolitical wisdom to a large audience of Republican legislators
who wanted his views.
   To a rapt audience, some of whom had not been born when Nixon
began his first term as a representative from California in 1947,
the former president roamed the political globe for more than an
hour. Republican Whip Newt Gingrich called the feat ``an
extraordinary tour de force.''
   Nixon was clearly elated by the response.
   ``It's good to be back here where my political career started 43
years ago,'' he said.
   ``Why are you here?'' asked a reporter.
   ``Because they invited me.''
   That, in itself, is something that might not have happened only
a few years ago. For a decade after his 1974 resignation _ prompted
by an imminent impeachment vote in the House _ Nixon was anathema
to Republicans. His name was not mentioned at GOP political
gatherings or at national conventions.
   But he worked his way back, through analytical books about world
affairs, magazine articles, a few speeches to influential
audiences, off-the-record dinners with reporters, trips to China
and meeting with successor presidents who sought his views.
   He was pale and a bit more jowly than in the past and his walk
was that of a 77-year-old man, which he is.
   But he was in good humor as he talked with reporters _ never his
favorite audience _ saying ``as I look at this crowd, I know I'm
getting older but the press seems to be getting younger.''
   In the closed session with the lawmakers and invited guests,
Nixon referred to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as a ``troika
_ a communist, a Russian nationalist and a brilliant practical
politician.''
   According to a House staff member who was there, Nixon said
Gorbachev decided he would risk his power to save his reforms,
rather than the other way around. And that, according to Nixon,
meant that Gorbachev ``would take credit for something he really
didn't want or set out to do.''
   Nixon called the developments in Eastern Europe ``a change of
the head and not of the heart.''
   Reporters asked what he thought of this week's proposal by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority leader, that direct
U.S. aid be sent to help the Soviet Union succeed in its reform
effort. Gephardt specifically called for food aid and freer
investment in the Soviet Union.
   ``My reaction to is that it is a bad idea: first, because
Gorbachev has not indicated his wants it,'' Nixon said. ``No aid,
directly or indirectly should be provided for Gorbachev unless his
reforms have a chance to work.''
   Further, Nixon said, Gorbachev must first adopt a less
aggressive foreign policy, particularly in the Third World.
   ``What has happened here is the Cold War is probably over in
Eastern Europe but is still being waged in the Third World,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev, he said, should also stop sending aid to Cuba.
   ``If Gorbachev continues to provide $6 billion a year to prop up
Castro, Castro is going to stay. If Gorbachev cuts off his water,
so to speak, Castro has to make his deal with the West.''
   ``The key is Gorbachev,'' said Nixon.
   At that point, Nixon was addressed as ``Mr. Gorbachev'' by a
tangle-tongued reporter.
   ``I've been called worse,'' said Nixon.

<HEAD>Government Supporters Stage Demonstration in Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Hundreds of government supporters staged a
demonstration Thursday in front of a house where witnesses said a
meeting of dissidents was taking place.
   The demonstration featured the chanting of anti-American slogans
and noisy expressions of support for hard-line President Fidel
Castro. It took place outside the home of Gustavo Arcos, a
well-known human rights activist who was said to be meeting with
three allies.
   A similar demonstraton occurred Monday in front of the home of
Arcos' brother, Sebastian Arcos, who also was said to have convened
a meeting of dissidents.
   Witnesses said that after neighbors learned of the Thursday
meeting the pro-government activists arrived and staged their
demonstration ``spontaneously.''
   It was a peaceful protest, but several participants reacted
angrily when an unidentified woman appeared on the balcony of the
home and stuck her tongue out at them.
   ``They are meeting at this house to make plans for the
counterrevolution,'' said one demonstrator.
   Castro has repeatedly said his country will never embrace the
reforms orchestrated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
increasingly accepted throughout Eastern Europe.
   An article in a Soviet newspaper Tuesday reflects the growing
divergence between the Kremlin and Cuba as Gorbachev moves to
reduce the power of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union.
   In the article, the weekly Moscow News said Castro has used
intransigence and relied on outdated ideas to keep his country in
check.
   It noted that state-run Cuban radio carried editorial attacks on
the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and blamed the
changes on ``weak governments unable to tackle economic turmoil.''
   ``Such categorical judgments are pronounced in an island with
total rationing, which insures people against poverty, but does not
give them the impetus to work,'' Moscow News said.
   It mocked the Cuban leader for his Dec. 7 statement saying, ``if
history will attach to us the role of the last defenders of
socialism in the world _ we will defend this stronghold to the last
drop of blood.''
   The Cuban model that Castro wants to defend is based on a
complete rejection of a market economy, moral principles over
material ones, a militarized state and an untouchable party-state
elite, the newspaper said.
   ``Cuba copied none other but Soviet administrative and economic
structures at the time when European socialism was sinking into the
swamp of stagnation'' based on the ideological dogma of the late
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, it said.
   Cuba gets about $5 billion in annual aid from the Soviet Union.
   Despite Castro's pledge to defend the party at all costs and
ignore change in the socialist community, Moscow News said about 15
dissident groups have emerged in Cuba.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Thursday it
is not surprising that a Soviet newspaper should be critical of
Cuba.
   ``Cuba remains a rigid police state,'' she said. ``At a time
where the Soviet government is changing its domestic and foreign
policies, Cuba is becoming ever more isolated and rigid.''
   ``Obviously, Cuba is out of step and resisting the rising tide
of change,'' she said. ``Castro is isolated even among socialist
countries.''

<HEAD>Castro Offers to Leave 1,000 Cuban Workers in Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has
offered to leave 1,000 Cuban workers in Nicaragua if the new
U.S.-supported administration agrees, the Sandinista party
newspaper said Thursday.
   In a front page story from Havana, the newspaper Barricada said
Castro offered to keep the volunteers on the Atlantic Coast, where
they are rebuilding homes damaged by a 1988 hurricane and helping
with health care and other community services.
   Most of them are in the port of Bluefields, where Castro said
they ``can remain if that is the wish of the new government and if
it guarantees the security of Cuban personnel.''
   Officials of Yatama, the dominant Atlantic Coast political
organization which supported President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, said the Cubans were welcome to stay.
   The newspaper said Cuba had been giving Nicaragua 90,000 tons of
crude oil and 50,000 rations of food a year. It said the food was
mostly for Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indian communities on the
Atlantic Coast.
   On Wednesday, Castro announced he will stop sending military
aid, petroleum or food after Mrs. Chamorro takes office.
   ``Our military cooperation ... will be withdrawn when the new
government takes office. It would not be possible to maintain our
presence with a government which has shown its dislike for the
Cuban revolution,'' Castro said in a speech to a women's
organization in Havana.
   Excerpts of the speech were quoted in a dispatch by the Cuban
government news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City.
   Exact figures on Cuban military aid have never been released by
Havana or Managua. However, the U.S. State Department said last
year that Moscow provided about $500 million in military aid to
Nicaragua in 1988.
   Since Mrs. Chamorro's election, Cuban Ambassador Fernando Ravelo
has returned to Havana ``for consultations'' and a secretary at the
embassy, who answered the telephone, said she had no information on
his return.
   Last fall, the Soviet Union said it had suspended further
weapons shipments to Nicaragua under President Mikhail Gorbachev's
liberalization policies.
   Also Thursday, representatives of the Sandinistas and Mrs.
Chamorro's United National Opposition met privately to make
Nicaragua's first transition to an elected opposition government a
peaceful one.
   Details of the talks were not made public immediately. But
officials on both sides said they centered on demands for the
immediate demobilization of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels and
Mrs. Chamorro's plan to sharply cut the armed forces, which are
controlled by the Sandinista party.
   Both Mrs. Chamorro and outgoing President Daniel Ortega have
called on the Contras, based in neighboring Honduras, to demobilize
immediately.
   But rebel leaders say they will only do so after Mrs. Chamorro
is sworn into office April 25 for a six-year term and after their
safety is guaranteed when they return.
   Another issue reportedly being discussed is UNO's plan to return
private property, expropriated by the Sandinistas during their
decade in office, as part of a policy of lifting state controls
over the economy and encouraging private enterprise.
   The Sandinistas are balking at returning banks to private
ownership.
   UNO leaders, meanwhile, are complaining the Sandinistas are
trying to ram through the National Assembly, which they will still
control for more than a month, bills legalizing titles to
properties the government confiscated and distributed among
Sandinista supporters.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned what it said were
recent actions taken by the Sandinista government, including
distributing weapons to their followers, as ``disturbing signs that
the Sandinistas are not keeping faith with their promises to honor
a peaceful transfer of power.''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman, also cited the
emptying of government offices and threats to enact economic
measures. Such measures ``would make it exceedingly difficult to
bring about the economic recovery of that country,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Chamorro left Thursday for Caracas to visit
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez before going to Houston
for additional treatment for a knee that she fractured on Dec. 31.
   It was her second trip abroad as president-elect. Wednesday, she
visited briefly with another old friend, President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Top Republicans Predict Party Change on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading Republicans in Congress predicted
on Thursday that their party will change the strict anti-abortion
stance that has been part of its platform since 1980.
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the second-ranking Republican
in the Senate, predicted the 1992 GOP platform committee will
``come up with something'' in an effort to soften the plank.
   ``It will speak to the sanctity of life and it will do things
and it will be probably altered. I'm sure of that,'' said Simpson,
who has long held the position that a woman should have the right
to have an abortion.
   ``I don't know whether it will be an exact excising or changing
of it or what,'' he said.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, and Simpson
disputed the widespread perception that Republican candidates
opposed to abortion have been hurt since a Supreme Court ruling
last summer. The court gave states more authority to restrict
abortions _ and thus intensified political debate on the
emotion-filled issue.
   But Gingrich, who opposes abortion rights, said the new GOP
platform will cater to voters' conflicting feeling about abortion
by supporting restrictions if not a total ban.
   ``The Republican Party, I will venture to predict ... will draw
the line in such a way that we are clearly the party which will
have fewer abortions in America than the Democrats,'' he said.
   ``We will be for restrictions that NOW and NARAL will not favor
such as making sure that 12-year-olds have their parent's consent
before they go to an abortion clinic.'' he said.
   The National Organization for Women and the National Abortion
Rights Action League oppose government blocking a woman's right to
choose abortion. They also oppose efforts in some states to require
one or both parents' consent or notification before a minor woman
can receive an abortion.
   ``We will in fact be responsive to changing circumstances,''
Gingrich said, citing polls that gauge which abortion restrictions
are favored by the public.
   President Bush has stuck by the anti-abortion position that he
embraced as a vice presidential candidate in 1980. But Republican
Party officials, including national chairman Lee Atwater, have
sought to defuse the divisive issue by saying the party has no
litmus test and remains open to candidates and voters on both sides
of the abortion debate.

   Marcia Hoebreckx can practice piano in her
condominium, but only if she keeps her foot firmly on the soft
pedal, a judge ruled.
   A neighbor complained that Hoebreckx's rendition of Chopin
violated a 1981 city ordinance that prohibits Boulder residents
from ``disrupting the quiet enjoyment of a home.''
   Municipal Judge Richard Hansen reluctantly upheld the complaint
Wednesday, and fined the pianist $30. If she wants to continue her
hobby, she must perform pianissimo, he said.
   The judge acknowledged the ordinance was a ``poor'' law, and
encouraged Hoebreckx to either appeal or orchestrate a campaign to
repeal the ordinance.
   ``I really feel being allowed to play the piano in the privacy
of my home is an inalienable right,'' Hoebreckx said. ``My peace of
mind, my whole living standard has been violated.''
   Hoebreckx, coordinator of a writing program at the University of
Colorado, said she never plays before 10 a.m. or after 10 p.m.
   Her next-door neighbors, Chris Whelan and Julia Ermes,
complained to the Environmental Protection Office. When mediation
failed, a trial was arranged.
   Other neighbors testified they weren't bothered by the music,
and decibel tests found the noise to be within acceptable limits.
But the judge said he had no choice in accepting the ordinance.
   The City Council, he said, wanted ``a silent town, and they
passed an ordinance designed to get that with little or no
consideration given to the active people or things that might make
noise.''
   Hoebreckx says she's considering her options, but they don't
include quitting the piano. ``It's what I do and what I enjoy,''
she said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Suggests Spy Agencies Differ on Soviet Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's main intelligence agencies
disagree on whether the waning Soviet military threat could be
revived, a Pentagon official suggested Thursday.
   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
ackowledged that Cheney differs on the issue with CIA Director
William Webster, who told Congress last week it is unlikely the
Soviets would pose a major military threat in the future, even if
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were replaced by hardliners.
   Cheney contends that Moscow's move toward a less aggressive
military stance could be reversed if Gorbachev lost power. Cheney
argues that this possibility alone is reason not to rapidly reduce
U.S. troop levels and military spending.
   At a Pentagon briefing, Williams denied a published report that
Cheney's view also is at odds with the Defense Intelligence Agency,
the Pentagon's intelligence arm.
   ``There is no evidence that the secretary and the DIA are out of
step'' on the question of whether the Soviet reforms are
reversible, Williams said, adding later that it would be ``a fair
characterization'' to say Cheney and the DIA agree on the issue.
   Williams' remarks suggested that the DIA and the CIA don't agree
on the issue, although the spokesman declined to comment directly
on the agencies' exact views.
   ``We don't discuss intelligence, so I'm somewhat limited in the
answer that I can give,'' he said.
   The disagreement has important political implications because
Bush administration estimates of Soviet military capabilities play
an important role in the congressional debate under way on next
year's defense budget.
   Williams said the split between Webster and Cheney was not
personal and the two planned to hold a breakfast meeting at CIA
headquarters Thursday to discuss world events.
   Williams also sought to play down Cheney's remark in a weekend
television interview that Webster's testimony _ delivered on the
same day Cheney was giving another congressional committee a
different view of the Soviet threat _ was ``not helpful'' to the
administration's efforts to win approval of the defense budget.
   ``Secretary Cheney does not view anyone's job as defending the
defense budget in their testimony in Congress,'' Williams said. He
added later that Cheney ``has no intention to ... stifle different
views within the intelligence community.''

   A doctor who was suing the city claiming she had
contracted AIDS though the carelessness of another physician
accepted a settlement Thursday as attorneys were preparing to
present their trial summations.
   The judge would say only that the amount was ``between zero and
$100 million.''
   Jurors interviewed after the settlement indicated they had been
leaning in favor of the plaintiff, Dr. Veronica Prego.
   Prego, pale and looking tired as she sat between her two
attorneys, sighed in relief as the judge dismissed the jurors. She
said a short time later she was happy the trial had finally ended.
   ``It's been extremely difficult for me,'' she said, complaining
that her health had worsened because of the strain of the more than
2-month-long trial. ``Now it's time to take care of myself.''
   The trial judge, Justice Aaron D. Bernstein of Brooklyn's state
Supreme Court, ordered the lawyers on both sides not to disclose
the amount of the settlement.
   ``It's no one's business, except the people who are paying it
and the person who's receiving it,'' Bernstein said. ``It has
nothing to do with the relative merits of this case.''
   Under the agreement, sealed by Bernstein, none of the parties
named in Prego's lawsuit acknowledged any guilt.
   Prego maintained in her lawsuit, which named the city Health and
Hospitals Corp. and two physicians, that she contracted the deadly
disease when a doctor who drew blood from an AIDS patient in 1983
left the contaminated needle and other debris on the patient's
bedding. Prego said she accidentally pricked her finger while
cleaning up the waste.
   Diane Wilner, a lawyer for Prego, said the settlement was
reluctantly accepted because defense lawyers said they would appeal
any jury victory by Prego.
   ``Dr. Prego must live the rest of her life with some peace and
must be able to put this behind her,'' Wilner said. ``In essence, I
believe they put a gun to our head with the appeal.''
   An appeal would tie the matter up in the courts for two to three
years. Prego's doctor had testified the 32-year-old woman might
have less than a year to live.
   Health and Hospitals Corp. lawyer Stanley D. Friedman said of
the settlement, ``We're most pleased, I can't tell you the numbers,
but we're most pleased.''
   Most of the six jurors said they were glad they were spared
deciding the outcome, but indicated they were leaning toward Prego.
   ``I was on Miss Prego's side because it's a human life. You
can't replace that,'' said Jill Goldberg, a 22-year-old cashier.
``I felt bad for her. ... I think the hospital was negligent.''

<HEAD>Group Wants Anti-Smoking Spots to Balance Sports Sponsors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A children's advocacy group asked on Thursday
that regulators require broadcasters and cable TV operators show
anti-smoking messages on youth-oriented programs if they televise
sports events sponsored by cigarette companies.
   Action for Children's Television, which was instrumental in
reviving advertising limits for Saturday morning children's TV
shows, asked the Federal Communications Commission to close a
``loophole'' in a 1969 law that banned cigarette advertising from
television.
   The group said cigarette companies got around the ban after it
went into effect in 1971 ban by sponsoring televised sports events
such as tennis tournaments and car races, making their brands part
of the names of the events.
   ACT said TV cameras also routinely show billboards advertising
cigarettes behind the sports action being shown. ACT called them
``hidden commercials'' that subverts the purpose of the 1969 law.
   Congress passed the law ``because it had concluded that it is
not in the public interest to have cigarettes advertised over such
unique media that reach into every household and are particularly
viewed by the young,'' ACT told the FCC.
   ``The young are being bombarded over television by hidden
messages associated with sports ... that are meant to show that
smoking is attractive,'' ACT President Peggy Charren said in an
interview.
   ACT said it was no accident that cigarette companies created the
Virginia Slims tour in 1971, Winston Cup racing in 1971 and
Marlboro Cup racing in 1973. The sponsors often place billboards in
positions where cameras are sure to pick them up, the group said.
   The filing quoted from an opinion piece by syndicated columnist
George Will in the Feb. 25 Washington Post that said NBC-TV's
93-minute telecast of the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix contained 4,997
images of Marlboro billboards and 249 of the Marlboro-sponsored car.
   ``The brand name was visible 46 of the 93 minutes _ 49 percent
of the telecast,'' ACT told the FCC.
   ACT called on the FCC to require broadcast and cable networks
that show such events ``carry offsetting anti-smoking messages''
during the advertising breaks in ``programs that have large youth
audiences.''
   Officials at the New York-based Philip Morris Co., which makes
Virginia Slims and Marlboro cigarettes, and at Winston-Salem,
N.C.-based R.J. Reynolds, which makes Winston, had no immediate
comment on the filing. Nor did Washington representatives of the
broadcasting and cable TV industries.
   Charren said she believes the time is ripe to petition the
government on this issue in the wake of recent attacks on cigarette
advertising by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
and reports that tobacco companies were aiming new brands at blue
collar, white females and urban blacks.
   Congress also recently imposed a virtual ban on smoking on U.S.
airliners, and Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, has introduced
legislation to outlaw tobacco advertising and promotion that could
reach anyone under age 18. It would also bar sponsorship of events
that use a cigarette brand name.
   Luken's bill would permit text-only ads in newspapers, magazines
and other publications, plus signs and billboards outside, but not
in, sports facilities.
   When the 1969 law went into effect the FCC dropped provisions of
its so-called fairness doctrine that required anti-smoking messages
on television.

<HEAD>Youngsters' Watch More PBS When Left Alone Than Supervised, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young children left to themselves watch more
educational television than when their parents watch with them,
says a new study that looked at scores of working-class households
in California.
   ``These findings suggest that children prefer PBS (Public
Broadcasting Service) over commercial networks, but when children
and parents view TV together, they watch the commercial channels
that the parents prefer,'' the study said.
   It supported previous findings that preschool children watch
about 25 hours of television a week, watch fewer hours after they
start school and are usually unsupervised by parents in their
programming choices, authors said.
   ``The important thing to me is that the attitude that parents
set up in relation to television in the home seems to have an
impact on what children will watch and how much they watch,'' said
Dr. Howard L. Taras, lead author and assistant pediatrics professor
at the University of California at San Diego.
   ``Children of parents who regard television more as a babysitter
or distraction will watch more TV,'' he said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   Also, children of parents who regard television more as an
educational tool will watch more PBS, he said.
   The study found children viewed more PBS programming in
households where television was not routinely being used as
entertainment, parents were not viewing TV with the youngsters more
than 50 percent of the time, and children had a strong influence on
program selection.
   The study was based on interviews with working-class English-and
Spanish-speaking parents from households that totaled 66 children
ages 3 to 8 in a suburban San Diego community. Findings were
published in the March issue of the American Medical Association's
American Journal of Diseases of Children.
   ``I hope beyond hope that they're right, but I can't quite
believe it,'' said Peggy Charron, president of Action for
Children's Television, a child advocacy group based in Cambridge,
Mass.
   And yet, she said, the findings make sense because preschoolers
``like public broadcasting. ... They relate to Mr. Rogers because
he's talking to them, and they really get to know him and _ as much
as possible through the medium of television _ get to love him,''
she said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``He's like a substitute parent. And they love Sesame Street.
... I can't imagine what they get out of commercial broadcasting.
It's so noisy and fast, and peculiar and violent.''
   Gary Selnow, a visiting professor of communications studies at
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., agreed with the speculation of
the study's authors: ``If the parents are watching with the kids,
there may be sort of subtle pressure for parents to encourage the
kids to watch something that would also be of interest to the
parents.''
   But he refused to ``jump'' on network television.
   Commercial programs promote many of society's most laudable
values _ ``people who help each other are the ones who succeed.
Problems are resolved by hard work,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   The study did not single out particular programs from commercial
or public television.
   Taras said the group plans to follow up on its findings with
more detailed research.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York legislator and a Florida couple
whose six-week-old son was found dead on an infant pillow urged the
Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday to immediately
recall the cushions.
   Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato criticized the commission for
``an entirely too casual attitude'' about taking legal action
against the pillow manufacturers.
   The commission on Tuesday warned consumers not to allow infants
to sleep on the small pillows or cushions, which are filled with
plastic foam beads, because of the potential danger of suffocation.
   Ten infants have died while sleeping on the pillows since 1987,
the agency said. It has not taken action against the manufacturers
or distributors because an investigation is ongoing, officials said.
   Gigi Lindstrom, whose son died on one of the pillows last year,
urged parents not to use the pillows, retailers to take them off
store shelves, manufacturers to recall them and lawmakers to take
action to remove the ``killer pillows'' from the marketplace.
   D'Amato, who earlier this week praised the agency's warning to
consumers, on Thursday complained it had tried to dissuade
increased publicity which might ``disrupt delicate industry
negotiations'' the agency is conducting.
   An agency spokesman said officials had not tried to prevent the
publicity but said ``there was concern about releasing names of
companies ... which could jeopardize our activities down the road.''

<HEAD>IRS, Owed a Dime, Bills for $54.94 in Penalties and Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For want of a dime, the Internal Revenue
Service hit Mary Frances Stinson with a bill for $54.94.
   The Dorchester, Mass., woman underpaid by 10 cents when she
filed her federal tax return in 1987. The IRS computers eventually
caught the mistake and last October sent a form letter telling her
she had been hit with a $24 late-payment penalty and interest of
$30.84.
   ``It was almost like a joke,'' Ms. Stinson said Thursday. ``If I
have to, I'll pay them, which really stinks.'' She acknowledged,
however, that she has yet to write the IRS to clear up the mistake.
   As spelled out on the form Ms. Stinson received, the penalty is
limited by law to 25 percent of the late tax _ in this case that
would be 2 cents. The interest on the late payment averages about
10 percent, which would be about a penny a year for Ms. Stinson.
   ``I wouldn't think we would even send a notice on 10 cents
due,'' said IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely, noting that a stamp costs
25 cents. Any time an erroneous bill is send, he said, ``you should
just write and tell us.''
   Ms. Stinson said she had telephoned her local IRS office and was
told to write the IRS regional service center in Andover, Mass.,
which sent the form letter.
   ``So it's just a matter of writing up the actual letter and
informing them of this,'' she told a reporter. ``But it was a
little unreal to me that I'd even get that type of thing in the
first place.''
   Instead of writing the IRS, Ms. Stinson handed her bill to the
National Coalition of IRS Whistleblowers, which was established by
the Church of Scientology.
   The coalition called the form letter an outrage and turned it
over to a reporter.

<HEAD>Slumping ``Today'' Show Second in Sweeps Ratings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC's slumping ``Today'' show lost to ABC's
``Good Morning America'' in ratings ``sweeps'' for the first time
since November 1985, according to audience estimates made public
Thursday.
   In the Feb. 1-28 sweeps, ABC's show, which has won the ratings
race for the last nine weeks, averaged a 4.5 rating. ``Today'' had
a 3.65 average and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.7. Each
rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   NBC executives have said they expected ``Today'' ratings to dip
after co-host Jane Paley was succeeded by Deborah Norville in
January. They say that also happened when Bryant Gumbel succeeded
Tom Brokaw on the show in 1982.
   However, February's figures show a considerable drop for
``Today,'' whose troubles include the leak last year of Gumbel's
caustic memo about some staff members, and controversy over
Pauley's replacement by Norville.
   Last year, when a ratings point represented 904,000 homes,
``Today'' won the February sweeps with a 4.6 average, followed
closely by ``Good Morning America'' with a 4.2. ``CBS This
Morning'' averaged a 2.6 then.
   The sweeps occur four times a year and are periods of intense
audience measurements in the nations's 211 TV markets, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co. They are important to local stations, which
use the results to set their advertising rates.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Democrats' Campaign Finance Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats pushed their version of a campaign
finance bill with fixed limits on how much candidates can spend
through a Senate committee Thursday as prospects for a compromise
brightened
   The Rules Committee approved the Democrat's ideas for reform on
a 7-3 party-line vote, but lawmakers acknowledged the action was
intended only to get serious negotiations started between the two
parties.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he intends to
bring the issue before the full Senate as soon as it completes
action on a clean air bill and crime legislation _ possibly late
this month or early April.
   ``The Senate now knows that the issue is not going away,'' said
Okalahoma Sen. David Boren, the primary author of the Democratic
bill. ``There has to be a time deadline out there for the
negotiations to begin.''
   Boren and his key ideological opponent on the issue, Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., both said their hopes for a compromise were
buoyed by an outside panel's endorsement Wednesday of limits on how
much candidates can raise from political action committees and
out-of-state donors.
   The six-member task force appointed by Mitchell and Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas called for ``flexible''
spending ceilings with a provivion that would exclude small
contributions _ possibly $250 or less _ from in-state donors from
the total.
   Boren hailed it as the first bipartisan recognition of the need
for some form of spending ceiling while McConnell praised the
distinction between ``good money from those who can vote for you
and bad money from special interests and other outsiders who
can't.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, called the recommendation a ``genius
solution'' to the GOP's abhorrence of any spending limits and
Democrats' fears of superior Republican Party fund raising.
   However, there is still widespread disagreement between the
parties and within each on how much political action committees, or
PACs, should be reigned in and the role of now-unreported,
so-called ``soft money'' in politics.
   The task force avoided the ``soft money'' issue but proposed
cutting allowable individual PAC contributions to a candidate in
half once the aggregate of them reach's one-third of the
candidate's spending ceiling.
   PAC contributions in recent elections have overwhelmingly gone
to Democratic incumbents, and Republicans would like to cut the
allowable gift by a PAC to an individual candidate from $10,000 to
$2,000 per election cycle.
   Boren and Mitchel have proposed putting a $100,000 ceiling on
PAC gifts a House candidate can receive and an $825,000 lid on
Senate candidates. In addition they would tell the parties' Senate
and House campaign committees that no more than 30 percent of their
total contributions could come from PACs.

   The House ethics committee said Thursday it
found ``no adequate basis'' to investigate Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich, but criticized his failure to disclose a home purchase
and his loose control over his staff.
   The report concluded that even if most allegations made against
the Georgia Republican were true, they would not violate House
rules.
   The No. 2-ranking House Republican, who was the chief accuser in
the ethics case that triggered Democratic Speaker Jim Wright's
resignation last year, has called the case filed against him a
political retaliation.
   Gingrich said Thursday the report demonstrated the charges filed
by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., were ``politically inspired
nonsense.''
   He contended the ``political smear'' cost taxpayers at least
$300,000 and himself more than $100,000 in legal fees. Jan Keyes,
spokeswoman for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _
the ethics panel's formal name _ said she could not verify the
$300,000 cost.
   Gingrich was criticized by the committee for failing to report
on his annual disclosure forms his joint purchase, with his
daughter, of her home in Fulton County, Ga. in 1986.
   He also was criticized for his staff's use of his official
letterhead in December 1986 and January 1987 to promote a
for-profit cruise.
   Gingrich was ordered to ``promptly amend'' his disclosure
statments to reflect purchase of the house and was warned of ``more
severe committee action'' if he fails to prevent future misdeeds by
his staff.
   But Alexander's complaint was also criticized. ``Some of the
assertions are pure speculation,'' the committee concluded.
``Others advance unusual legal arguments not supported by prior
committee interpretations.''
   The most publicized issue in the case was whether Gingrich
violated outside income limits and rules against receiving gifts
from those with a direct interest in legislation.
   The allegations focused on the ``COS Limited Partnership''
Gingrich formed to promote a book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' he
wrote with his wife and a third author. Alexander also questioned
Gingrich's royalty arrangement.
   The committee found Gingrich properly listed as royalties the
$24,036 he and his wife received from book sales and advances.
Alexander questioned whether Gingrich exceeded outside income
limits with the payments, but the committee concluded the royalties
were exempted from the ceiling.
   The committee also rejected Alexander's allegation that the
$105,000 raised from the 21 ``COS'' investors to promote the book
could be considered ``gifts'' from people seeking legislative
favors from Gingrich.
   ``The partners may simply have been seeking, in addition to
making investments, advancing the political or philosophical
policies which Rep. Gingrich advocated in the book,'' the committee
said. Gingrich is the leader of conservative Republicans in the
House.
   ``In sum, the committee is of the firm view that no adequate
basis exists for initiating a preliminary inquiry'' in the case,
the panel said, referring to the first phase of its investigative
process.
   The committee set up what amounted to an initial investigation
when it hired a Chicago law firm last July for advice on whether to
pursue the case. The firm recommended last October the case should
be dismissed due to lack of evidence that rules were broken.
   The panel wrote Gingrich a letter on the home purchase and the
travel promotion, which paralleled its findings in the report.
   ``You were remiss in your oversight and administration of your
congressional office,'' the committee wrote in criticizing the
letters promoting the cruise for senior citizens.
   Gingrich on Thursday blamed the travel-promotion letters on a
staffer _ ``a young man who made a mistake in judgment.''
   The panel also wrote Gingrich that the joint purchase of his
daughter's home ``as well as the underlying liability you incurred,
should have been reported on your financial disclosure statements.''
   The panel said it considered _ and rejected _ Gingrich's
contention that he was only a guarantor of the loan and signed
documents only as an accommodation for his daughter.
   Gingrich said Thursday he failed to report that he co-signed the
mortgage stemmed because he misread of House rules.

<HEAD>FBI Director Denies Suspension Triggered by Agent's Bias Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William B. Sessions strongly
denied on Thursday an allegation that a highly decorated
counterespionage agent was suspended because of his efforts to
uncover anti-Hispanic bias at the bureau.
   The charge was leveled earlier this week by attorneys for
Fernando Mata, a Miami-based agent who was suspended, with pay,
about two months ago. Administration sources, who declined
identification, said he was suspected of unauthorized contacts with
Cuban intelligence agents.
   Mata, 48, a Cuban-American, was a key witness in a successful
1988 suit by 311 Hispanic agents who accused the bureau of bias in
hirings, promotions and discipline. His attorneys, Hugo Rodriguez
and Antonio Silva, have charged that Mata and other Hispanics
involved in the suit have been targeted for harassment at a time
when a court-appointed panel is about to begin a follow-up review
of the case.
   ``The FBI categorically denies retaliation against Agent Mata,''
Sessions said Thursday in a written statement. ``There is no
connection between Agent Mata's being placed on administrative
leave with pay and the lawsuit in which he participated. The FBI
further denies that it leaked any information relating to the
inquiry.''
   ``The FBI is acutely aware of its obligations to protect the
rights of employees who use legal procedures available to them to
express their grievances,'' the director's statement continued.
``Allegations of retaliation against any employee for having taken
advantage of these procedures are taken very seriously by the FBI,
and, if confirmed, will be met with stern disciplinary action.
Allegations that information of an official nature may have been
leaked by any FBI employee for any reason will likewise be met with
stern disciplinary action if confirmed.''
   Mata, who in 1983 received the Justice Department's top award
for counterespionage, has said that in 1988, shortly before his
testimony in the discrimination case, he was confronted with
allegations that he compromised national security while working
undercover. No charges have ever been filed against him.
   ``The case against Mr. Mata is a house of cards,'' said Silva,
an El Paso, Texas, attorney who represented Mata in the bias case,
heard by U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in El Paso. ``There
is no substance whatsoever to the allegations,'' Silva said. ``It
is nothing more than reprisals and retaliation against him.''
   Bunton ruled that the FBI had demonstrated a pattern of
discrimination against Hispanics, called its affirmative action
program ``bankrupt,'' and ordered sweeping changes in its promotion
policies. A special panel headed by former Rep. Barbara Jordan,
D-Texas, is about to begin its evaluation of the FBI's compliance,
and Mata and others are expected to testify once more.
   In Miami, Rodriguez, Mata's other attorney, said ``It is very
ironic that those hearings are going to go forth next month, and
that allegations against Mr. Mata and other agents ... are all of a
sudden surfacing.'' He said minor administrative actions had been
taken against about 10 others involved in the lawsuit, including
agents in El Paso and San Antonio, Texas; Los Angeles; San Juan,
Puerto Rico, and Atlanta.
   Overall, there are 425 Hispanic agents among the FBI's 10,000
employees, according to Rodriguez, himself a former agent.
   Rodriguez confirmed that his client had again been questioned
about the possibility of contacts with Cuban intelligence agents
several years ago. He said Mata had taken several lie detector
tests, and passed them all. ``Fernando Mata is not a spy. They know
that, everyone knows that,'' Rodriguez said.
   Only one FBI agent has ever been charged with espionage. Richard
Miller, an FBI counterspy based in Los Angeles, was convicted of
delivering defense secrets to Soviet agents, but the conviction was
overturned by a federal appeals court last year. A new trial is
scheduled to begin later this year.

<TEXT>
   A sheriff who relieved his overcrowded
jail by commandeering a National Guard armory and refusing to budge
won a victory Thursday when the state promised him another
refurbished armory.
   Under the agreement, approved by Hampden County Superior Court
Judge George Keady, county Sheriff Michael Ashe would move from the
Springfield armory to a vacant armory in Holyoke about 10 miles to
the north once the state has made about $77,500 worth of repairs to
the building.
   ``Obviously, we're tremendously pleased,'' Ashe said.
   ``Everyone has won,'' said Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, the state
assistant attorney general handling the case.
   Holyoke officials, however, were outraged by the decision,
saying their armory lacks parking, is surrounded by homes and sits
across the street from a preschool and kindergarten.
   ``Our primary concern is that 500 young schoolchildren should
not be exposed to a jail 40 yards from their facility. It's highly
inappropriate,'' said Mayor Martin Dunn, who ordered city lawyers
to try to get a court order blocking the move.
   Holyoke had officials tried to have the court hearing delayed
until Monday, but Keady said the issue couldn't wait.
   ``I think this matter is such it deserves immediate attention,''
the judge said in approving the order, entered jointly by the state
and county.
   Ashe said he understood Dunn's concerns. He said only
minimum-security prisoners close to the end of their terms would be
sent to the armory and that other Springfield lockups close to
community agencies have operated peacefully.
   ``I know this is a difficult thing but we had an emergency.
Something had to be done and we just had to stand up for this,''
said Ashe, noting that 25 percent of Hampden County prisoners come
from Holyoke.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis praised the agreement. ``We all want to
keep violent criminals in jail,'' he said.
   Thursday's amicable settlement contrasted with the days
immediately following Ashe's Feb. 16 seizure of the Springfield
armory under a 17th-century law. The statute orders citizens to
give ``suitable aid'' to law enforcement efforts.
   The state tried to evict the sheriff, but was blocked by a
temporary restraining order he won from a judge. State officials
never conceded Ashe's argument that his mission to keep the peace
justified his action.
   It was not clear where funds would come for Ashe to run the
armory as a jail.
   The agreement calls for the sheriff and the state to make their
best efforts to obtain the approximately $470,000 Ashe estimates it
will cost him to run the Holyoke armory until June.
   The pact notes that Massachusetts is in a fiscal crisis, and
says that if new revenues aren't available, the state may have to
dip into funds other sheriffs are trying to obtain for their
crowded jails.
   The ``best-efforts'' clause isn't a guarantee the money will be
there, said Dukakis spokeswoman Mindy Lubber.
   ``It means just that, our best, good-faith efforts. It does not
mean this is an insurance policy,'' she said.
   Repairs to the Holyoke armory, which was closed March 1, should
be completed within weeks, and inmates may be moved there next
month, Ashe said. The temporary prison will be used only until a
new jail is built in Ludlow, which is expected to take at least two
years.
   No limit was set on the number of inmates, but only as many will
be moved as needed to keep the old jail at its federal limit of no
more than 500 inmates. So far, up to 26 inmates have been kept at
the Springfield armory.
   Under the agreement, Ashe will establish a jail population
committee to discuss the best way of dealing with cramped prison
space.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed a
committee Thursday to recommend solutions to the financial problems
of health care and pensions in the coal industry.
   Mrs. Dole named W.J. Usery, the ``supermediator'' in the
Pittston Co. coal strike settled last month, to chair the 11-member
panel.
   Pension and health benefits were the key issues in the 10-month
dispute between Pittston and Appalachia coal miners. Usery noted
that health care concerns have been at the heart of 87 percent of
the nation's labor-management disputes in the past two years.
   ``The knowledge we gain through this commission may shed some
light on the means of solving the broader problems of health plans
and health care coverage'' in all of American industry, Mrs. Dole
said at a news conference.
   Usery, secretary of labor for President Ford, said he thought
the panel might be able to come up with suggestions for the coming
decade. Its recommendations are due in six months.
   ``The issue is health care ... how does this vital industry keep
it in the private sector and deliver,'' Usery said.
   The committee will review a 40-year-old agreement under which
coal companies contribute to the United Mine Workers' national
retirement and health trust funds.
   The Pittston dispute stemmed from the company's decision to stop
paying into the funds, which cover about 130,000 working and
retired miners. Pittston said it could not keep up the payments and
remain competitive.
   The other commission members are UMW President Richard Trumka;
Henry Perritt, a law professor at Villanova University and deputy
secretary of labor under Usery; Robert Quenon, chairman of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association; Curtis Barnette of the
Bethlehem Steel Corp.; Richard Holsten of the Pittsburgh-Midway
Coal Mining Co.; Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance
Industry of America; Dr. Max Pepper of the St. Louis University
School of Medicine; Arlene Holen, formerly of the Office of
Management and Budget; Walter McNerney of Northwestern University
and formerly of Blue Cross-Blue Shield; and Michael Mahoney of the
New York actuarial consulting firm of Milliman and Robertson.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday
to approve the nomination of former New York state Sen. John R.
Dunne to be assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   The voice vote came one day after the committee grilled Dunne on
his lack of civil rights experience, membership in clubs that
excluded women and stock holdings in a company that does business
in South Africa.
   Only one committee member, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, voted
against Dunne's confirmation.
   A committe aide, speaking on condition of anonoymity, said the
nomination could reach the Senate floor as early as Friday.
   Dunne could not be reached for comment Thursday. His secretary
said she would have him call back, but when a reporter asked
whether Dunne was speaking to the press Thursday, she said, ``No.''
   Dunne, 60, of Garden City, N.Y., was tapped in January to be
assistant attorney general for civil rights. The post has been
vacant since December 1988, when William Bradford Reynolds resigned.
   President Bush's first nominee for the job, William C. Lucas,
then a Michigan county executive, was rejected by the committee by
a 7-7 vote last August. Lucas had spent most of his career in law
enforcement and had little litigation experience. He was also
opposed by many civil rights organization.
   Dunne, who was a state senator for 24 years, had been criticized
by civil rights groups for having very little civil rights
experience, but none opposed his nomination.

<HEAD>UNESCO Chief Defends Controversial Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOMTIEN, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNESCO'S director Thursday defended his
controversial restructuring plan for the agency after drawing
criticism from U.S. and other Western diplomats.
   Director General Federico Mayor on Feb. 28 established 24 new
management posts and promoted 18 top officials, including many who
came from the senior staff of his predecessor, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow
of Senegal.
   Mayor appointed the former deputy director of the Soviet State
Commission for Radio and Television, Henrikh Yushiavitshus, to the
sensitive post of deputy director general for communications.
   It had been expected that Mayor would give the communications
post to a Westerner as part of his campaign to induce the United
States and Britain to rejoin the organization, which they left in
the mid-1980s.
   Another Soviet, Boris Kluchnikov, was proposed as director for
Europe, a post that normally goes to a Western or a neutral
European.
   The United States and Britain, which had provided about 30
percent of the budget of the U.N. Education Scientific and Cultural
Organization, left the agency because they claimed it was
anti-Western, poorly managed and spending too much.
   Western and Japanese diplomats and the head of the U.S. observer
mission to Paris-based UNESCO, Richard T. Miller, called Mayor's
plan a mistake. A Japanese delegate said it showed UNESCO ``was
going backwards at great speed.''
   British news reports have criticized the cost of the plan. Mayor
confirmed that the appointments would cost $5 million but said the
measures he had introduced the past two years ago had saved three
times that amount.
   In an interview at the Thai beach resort of Jomtien, where he is
attending an international conference on education, Mayor called
British media criticism of his moves ``misleading and
ill-informed.''
   Mayor said the choice of officials from the Soviet Union
reflected the changing political climate it had inspired through
recent reforms.
   Asked whether the appointments were insensitive to British and
American interests, Mayor said: ``I cannot follow the sensibilities
of any countries. I have 161 countries.''
   ``I have chosen all my staff according to their personal
qualifications and professional achievments. I don't take into
account their belonging to official systems that were in the past
imposed in some countries,'' he said.
   Diplomats and British news reports said Mayor made his decision
without consulting UNESCO's executive board. Mayor said this was
true but was his right as the director general of the organization.
   Mayor succeeded M'Bow in 1987 and promised major reforms,
including a new communications strategy aimed at toning down a
UNESCO program critics saw as a threat to press freedom.
   Mayor said he received no political pressure from Britain, the
United States or the Soviet Union when making appointments.
   Japan is now the largest contributor to UNESCO, providing 16
percent of its $370 million two-year budget. Mayor said the Soviet
Union was the second largest donor.

   A widespread storm sprayed precipitation over much of the
central part of the nation Thursday, ranging from snow and freezing
rain in the North to flood-causing rain in the South.
   Freezing rain was a problem over much of the upper Mississippi
Valley, icing roads and breaking tree limbs and power lines in
parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   At midday, freezing rain, occasionally mixed with snow,
continued to fall from northeastern Minnesota across central
Minnesota and central Wisconsin.
   The freezing rain across Minnesota was expected to change to
snow during the night, accumulating to 1 to 3 inches by Friday
morning.
   Snow was scattered over the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Rain fell across western and southern Wisconsin and the
remainder of the southern two-thirds of Minnesota.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms also reached across northern
Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, western South Carolina, western North
Carolina, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, southern Tennessee,
northern Mississippi, southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon included 1.33
inches at Huntsville, Ala.
   Many rural roads in southwestern and central Arkansas were
flooded by locally heavy rain in overnight thunderstorms, and some
residents of low-lying areas of Little Rock had to evacuate.
   As much as 5 inches of rain fell in parts of central Arkansas
and nearly 7 inches fell in southwestern counties, the National
Weather Service said.
   Little Rock got 3.48 inches, a record there for any 24-hour
period in March.
   High wind caused scattered damage in western Tennessee, the
weather service said.
   In the Northwest, snow also fell on the Idaho Panhandle, and
rain was scattered along the coast of Washington.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 21 at
Grangeville, Idaho, to 88 at Harlingen, Texas.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 below zero at
Houlton, Maine.

   David Aupont spent his 12th birthday Thursday
fighting for his life after a bully allegedly beat him with a bat,
tied him up and set him afire in a garage because he refused to
smoke crack.
   While David couldn't celebrate, former President Reagan, the
White House and Mayor David Dinkins were among more than 100
well-wishers who showered him with cards, gifts, balloons, flowers
and messages, said hospital spokeswoman Diana Goldin.
   A suspect just a year older than David was arrested Wednesday
and charged in the attack, which left the victim in critical
condition.
   David, who was walking to school with three friends when the
Wednesday morning assault began, suffered second- and third-degree
burns over 55 percent of his body. Police said his attacker soaked
him with gasoline and set him aflame.
   ``This is going to be a long road for this young man,'' Dr.
Cleon Goodwin, head of the burn unit at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center, told reporters.
   Goodwin said that even if everything went perfectly in David's
recovery, he still would have to be hospitalized for up to four
months. He will have to undergo a series of skin-graft operations,
which could begin as soon as Friday.
   David suffered burns on his chest, stomach, arms, legs, chin and
mouth.
   The boy was in critical but stable condition, Goodwin said,
adding that the next few days were a critical time in his survival.
   ``He's a fighter,'' Goodwin said. ``If you ask him if it hurts,
he says, `No,' even when we know it does. He's tough.''
   Police remained unsure what prompted the attack, although the
boy told witnesses in his Brooklyn neighborhood that he was set
afire after refusing to smoke crack.
   An older cousin of David's, Odrige Aupont, said the attacker
approached his cousin and asked if he used crack, then ordered him
to come smoke crack. After David refused, the youth lit him on fire.
   Goodwin said David's parents, Luther and Premese Aumont, have
been with him as much as they can. ``He does know it's his
birthday. He's pretty overwhelmed by what's been going on,'' the
doctor said.
   The boy's father was sitting in the lobby of the hospital after
the news conference, holding a floral arrangement sent to his son.
He told reporters he had spoken with the boy but started crying and
could not continue.
   David, a clean-cut boy who attended the sixth grade at Walt
Whitman Intermediate school, is ``a normal kid. He got along with
(other) kids,'' said his step-brother, 22-year-old Rudy LeBrun.
   David's family moved to Brooklyn from Port-au-Prince, Haiti,
about 18 months ago. In addition to his step-brother, the boy has a
15-year-old sister, Naomi.
   The suspect, who was not identified because of his age, was
charged with attempted murder second degree, assault first degree,
kidnapping second degree, robbery and attempted robbery, said
police spokesman Officer Hugh Barry.
   He said the suspect looked as if he were 17 or 18 years old.
   The suspect was taken to the Spofford Youth House pending his
arraignment.
   According to Barry, the 13-year-old had robbed two youngsters on
their way to school Tuesday. Those two were walking with David and
a fourth youth on Wednesday morning when the 13-year-old came after
them again, he said.
   The first two youths recognized the boy and took off, but the
13-year-old was able to corner David and the fourth youth. After
robbing David's friend, the 13-year-old then grabbed David and
dragged him into a garage, police said.
   David, his hands tied behind his back, was beaten with a
baseball bat and set on fire inside the garage, authorities said.
David managed to escape and ran to an auto body shop where he
received help.
   ``Right now, we don't have a motive,'' said police Lt. Charles
Monahan. ``We may be dealing with just a psycho.''

   Four senators told President Bush Thursday
that Congress will press again this year for a U.S. contribution to
the United Nations population control agency, a fight that led to a
veto of last year's foreign aid bill.
   The lawmakers said Third World population growth poses ``a grave
threat to our own future security'' because of the increasing
pressures it places on the environment and on the political
stability of poor countries.
   Supporters of aid to the U.N. Population Fund dropped a $15
million appropriation for the agency as part of a compromise after
Bush vetoed the foreign aid bill last year. But they believe they
have a better chance of getting the aid approved because of growing
GOP restiveness on the abortion issue.
   Adding to their optimism is an agreement by the U.N. agency to
allow the United States to earmark its population aid for specific
countries whose family planning practices do not run counter to the
president's abortion stand.
   The House and Senate voted to send money to the agency last
year, which would have reversed a 5-year-old Reagan administration
policy. Anti-abortion forces objected because the agency sends
money to China, which uses coercion and abortion to enforce a
one-child-per-family policy.
   But Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., told Bush in the
letter Thursday that the U.N. agency does not support abortion and
has guaranteed it will not use American money in China.
   ``With the population of the developing countries projected to
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s ... we cannot afford to
remain outside the UNFPA,'' the senators wrote.
   A group of moderate House and Senate Republicans sent a similar
letter last month to Secretary of State James A. Baker III calling
for renewal of U.S. funding for the UNFPA.
   Last year's veto ``sent the wrong signal to the American public
and the international community regarding the Republican Party's
support for international family planning services,'' they wrote.

   A plane ran out of fuel and landed on a
four-lane highway Thursday, police said. No injuries or traffic
problems were reported.
   Peter Jacobs, 49, of Lone Pine, Calif., landed the single-engine
Cherokee at about 2 p.m. on the southbound lanes of state Route 28
about 35 miles north of Pittsburgh, police said.
   Jacobs' 16-year-old son, Jeramiah Jacobs, also was aboard the

   After landing, the plane was pushed to the side of the road and
the pilot sat beside his disabled craft waiting for fuel in hopes
he could take off from the highway, the officer said.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials were to decide whether
he could do that or whether the plane should be towed to a small
airport about five miles away.

<TEXT>
   Parliament agreed Thursday that a
united Germany should honor Poland's western border, and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl tried to fend off charges that he heightened
international fears about unification.
   A lawmaker from the opposition Social Democrats, Juergen
Schmude, said during a raucous debate that Kohl's handling of the
border issue amounted to ``political arson in the European house.''
   Parliament passed a resolution that said the two Germanys should
adopt twin declarations that ``the Polish people are assured their
right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us
Germans through territorial claims either now or in the future.''
   It says the future government of a united Germany should sign a
border treaty on the basis of those declarations.
   Poland's deputy prime minister, Leszek Balerowicz, told a news
conference in Gdansk, Poland, that Bonn's declaration was progress,
but that Poland still should attend talks on German unification.
   ``The government of the Republic of Poland treats it as a step
in the right direction, but it is not complete convergence,'' he
said.
   The invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 was the start of
World War II. Unease between Poles and Germans is long-standing.
   Kohl came under fire abroad and at home for his previous
reluctance to promise that a united Germany would never lay claim
to land ceded to Poland after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat.
   The chancellor, apparently trying to avoid offending
conservative voters with federal elections slated in December, had
insisted only the government of a united Germany could address the
matter.
   His demands that a border treaty be linked to Polish concessions
caused an uproar, and he withdrew them this week while proposing
the resolution that passed Thursday.
   Germany was split into Communist East and capitalist West after
the war. The rush toward unification followed the ouster of East
Germany's hard-line Communist leader, Erich Honecker, last October.
   The Social Democrats charged in Parliament that Kohl's
pronouncements had jeopardized the unification process.
   Social Democratic chief Hans-Jochen Vogel said Kohl ``squandered
(world) trust'' of Germans and ``endangered the process of German
unification in its most sensitive phase.
   ``And if people now start talking about the nasty Germans again,
if delays (in unification) occur, then you are to blame,'' he told
Kohl.
   Kohl insisted, ``Since I took over the government in 1982, I
have never given any reason to doubt that we hold to the spirit and
letter'' of standing West German-Polish agreements on border
guarantees.
   ``It is my aim to place reconciliation between the Polish and
German peoples on a lasting and firm basis.''
   He said the contribution of Vogel and his Social Democrats to
unification matters over the past years ``can be characterized as
simply pathetic.''
   The chancellor also seemed to address concern by Moscow that he
is trying to make unification occur too quickly.
   ``We are producing no artificial time pressures in order to
speed up unification,'' he said.
   But Kohl also said he would like any international concerns
about German unification settled soon, noting that a preliminary
round of the ``two-plus-four'' talks involving the Allies is set
for next week in Bonn.
   Officials from the World War II allies _ the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France _ are to meet next Wednesday with
the two Germanys.
   Among unification hurdles is the Soviet demand that a united
Germany not be a NATO member.
   Kohl repeated that a united Germany must belong to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said anew that what is now East
Germany could have a special military status, with NATO troops
barred from being stationed there.
   Kohl sought to allay concerns that a united Germany could become
an overmighty presence in Europe.
   ``No one needs to be worried about a German dominance in the
European Community. A united Germany would also be a reliable and
solid partner,'' Kohl said.
   Thursday's resolution touches on the two concessions Kohl sought
from the Poles _ a demand that Warsaw reaffirm its 1953 decision
not to seek war reparations, and to confirm its pledge last year to
protect the ethnic rights of Poland's German minority.
   The resolution says those decisions ``remain valid for a united
Germany.''
   The Social Democrats offered a resolution omitting mention of
the two issues, but the majority lawmakers from Kohl's coalition
government rejected it.

<HEAD>Group That Tested AIDS Drug Secretly Gets Government OK for Tests</HEAD>

   A San Francisco group that organized
underground tests of an AIDS drug derived from Chinese cucumber
roots won government approval to resume testing with a purified
form of the drug, an official of the group said Thursday.
   Project Inform, an AIDS treatment and education group, planned
to announce Friday that the Food and Drug Administration has
approved its application to conduct tests of the drug known as
Compound Q on about 100 patients, said Terry Beswick, research
director of the group.
   An FDA official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
confirmed the approval and said it brings Project Inform under the
agency's sanctioned clinical trials system, assuring that the
group's plan conforms to government standards for testing.
   ``It gives the agency more control over the situation than it
had before,'' the FDA official said. ``We had problems with the
(secret) trials _ whether the compound was pure, what problems
might be with the dose, who was taking it, that sort of thing. This
gives us a handle on that.''
   Working with Project Inform to come up with a study design that
meets FDA requirements was a better alternative than trying to put
the group out of business, the official said.
   ``How would you stop people from taking this drug if they really
wanted it? You're talking about quite an effort that might not be
successful,'' the official said. ``This way we're assured a good
hard look at dose and safety.''
   Last May, Project Inform secretly organized a Compound Q study
without FDA authorization. The group's leaders said they couldn't
wait for the government because desperate AIDS patients were
already experimenting with the drug.
   Doctors in the study infused their patients with Compound Q, the
name given to trichosanthin, a protein from the root of a
cucumberlike plant that Chinese doctors have used for centuries to
induce abortions and treat cancer. The group used couriers to
import the drug from China.
   By the time the FDA told Project Inform to discontinue the
unapproved experiments last August, the group had finished treating
patients with the drug and had begun to evaluate their data.
   In September, Martin Delaney, co-director of Project Inform,
said early results showed the drug holds promise but also has
serious risks associated with it. In earlier test-tube studies, the
drug appeared to selectively kill cells infected with the AIDS
virus.
   In the secret tests, about 60 patients were given infusions of
Compound Q by doctors in San Francisco, New York, Miami and Los
Angeles, according to Project Inform officials. Two patients died
during the trial and three others suffered severe dementia or
seizures, but recovered. Delaney said doctors did not believe the
drug caused the deaths.
   Under the new study approved by the FDA, the group's research
arm, Project Inform-Community Research Alliance, will test a highly
purified form of Compound Q on up to 100 patients who previously
were treated with the Chinese import, Beswick said.
   The FDA source said the patients in the new study will be
limited to those who were connected to Project Inform's earlier
underground study.
   But Beswick said others besides those who participated in the
earlier study could participate. He said ``hundreds of other
people'' have been treated with the Chinese version in underground
experiments.
   The purified form of the drug, called GLQ223, was developed at
the University of California at San Francisco and Genelabs of
Redwood City, Calif.
   This version of the drug is being studied on patients in
FDA-approved tests that were started at San Francisco General
Hospital last May.

<HEAD>Bush-Skinner Transportation Plan Would Cost Travelers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs to include Skinner congressional testimony and
more reaction.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush announced a national
transportation policy Thursday that would cost travelers more and
increase local governments' share in meeting air, land and sea
travel needs into the next century.
   Just as the Model T and the Wright brothers' plane ``prepared
the way for today's millions of cars and thousands of passenger
jets, so it is now our turn to invest in America's future,'' Bush
said in unveiling the policy with Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner.
   Bush said it would help keep America ``the world leader in
transportation.''
   The 129-page plan, ``Moving America Into The 21st Century,''
calls for more toll roads, local gas taxes, user fees, private
investments, competition, deregulaton, research into futuristic
systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as increased
attention to safety and protection of the environment.
   The policy was hailed as an important step by some industry
groups, but most expressed some disappointment, and Democratic
members of Congress were critical.
   Aviation and ground transportation groups opposed ``user fees''
and other taxes that Skinner acknowledged would require travelers
to pay more. The American Public Transit Association said the
policy was ``long on advice and short on help'' from the federal
government.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., chairman of the House surface
transportation subcommittee, called it ``a good start'' but said
shifting programs to the state and local level without financial
resources ``would be the shift and the shaft.''
   Bush did not immediately field questions on the proposal,
leaving Skinner to face news media.
   The secretary, who had the policy drawn up after holding 117
hearings across the country, justified proposals for increases in
local gasoline taxes and fees by saying polls show that people are
willing to pay if they get improvements.
   Skinner denied the policy represents a shift of responsiblity
for transportation away from the federal government, saying it was
an attempt to ``strike a balance'' after years in which the federal
government has assumed ``almost all of the responsibility'' for
funding some transportation systems.
   ``The federal commitment to infrastructure and to transportation
will continue to be at a very high level,'' he said, adding that
federal transportation budgets are expected to increase each year.
   ``It is not the panacea or the answer to all of the problems in
transportation,'' said Skinner. ``It was never designed to be that.
It was designed to be a strategic plan, or a framework under which
we could make the many decisions that we are required to make.''
   The plan outlines no major federal programs not already called
for in the president's budget request.
   Its overall goal is to maintain the U.S. transportation system
as ``the finest in the world.'' However, the report said ``there
are increasing signs ... that the system is beginning to break
down.''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the Senate surface
transportation subcommittee, said, ``I'm going to be looking
through this to see whether or not this simply doesn't transfer the
problems we have ... off the backs of the federal government and
onto the backs of state and local governments.''
   Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, top Republican on a
House transportation subcommittee, said, ``I think the money has to
come from users, one way or another, and because it is a national
plan, the logical way for it to come from users is through a
national tax system.''
   A coalition of 16 aviation industry groups said it opposes
Bush's proposed increases in aviation taxes, which the president's
fiscal 1991 budget calls ``user fees.''
   Air Transport Association president Robert Aaronson, who
represents major airlines, praised Skinner for ``real vision'' in
developing the plan. But he said increasing the share shippers and
air travelers pay to run the Federal Aviation Administration could
adversely affect the economy.
   ``Before being asked to pay more, funds already collected should
be spent,'' Aaronson said, referring to a $7 billion surplus in the
aviation trust fund, which is collected from airline ticket taxes.
   Later, Skinner defended his proposals before the House Public
Works and Transportation subcommittee on surface transportation.
   He said Congress would have to decide the balance of urban and
rural priorities when new highway legislation is considered next
year.
   Skinner was criticized by Rep. Robert A. Borski, D-Pa., for a
budget proposal that removes $20 million for the Philadelphia area
transit system. Skinner said the state government would have to
shoulder more of the burden, just as has happened with the Chicago
and New York mass transit systems.
   He said the system could no longer rely on ``the old
philosophy'' of ``free dollars in Washington.''
   Reaction among top state transportation officials varied.
   Thomas Harrelson, North Carolina transportation secretary, an
appointive post in a Republican administration, said problems are
``fast approaching the critical stage'' and Skinner's policy helps
move transportation ``higher on the national agenda.''
   Democratic appointee James Pitz, Michigan transportation
director, said Bush missed a chance to ``hit a home run'' by not
agreeing to spend more of the aviation and highway trust fund
revenue. He said the chance for private investment in
transportation is ``not overly significant.''

   Soviet populist Boris Yeltsin appealed to
Mikhail Gorbachev on Thursday to expel conservatives from the
ruling bodies and speed up reforms.
   Yeltsin said the Soviet president's popularity ``is fading
rapidly because the people are getting harder times rather than
better times after five years of perestroika, as a result of
Gorbachev's delays and half-measures.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's plan to restructure the economy.
   Yeltsin, saying again that he considers himself a Communist with
a soul of a social democrat, suggested the Soviet leader should
``get rid'' of leading conservatives such as Yegor Ligachev, a
member of the Soviet Politburo.
   Yeltsin, a member of the Soviet congress, was speaking at a news
conference in Milan during a European trip to promote his
autobiography. Leonardo Mondadori, Italian publisher of Yeltsin's
autobiography, said royalties from the book will be used to finance
a research center on AIDS in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet congressman said conservative forces had united in
the Soviet Union to form ``an efficient group in the party's
central committee.''
   ``We must not understimate this danger; we must remove Ligachev.
I can't understand why Gorbachev is delaying on the decision to get
rid of him. .... Ligachev is stuck to his chair, thus we must get
rid of him and of his chair. But it's up to Gorbachev to push the
button. He does not allow me to do it.''
   Yeltsin said the sweeping political changes in Eastern Europe
``could not have been possible without the beginning of perestroika
in the Soviet Union in 1985.''
   ``However, the Eastern countries have by now left us behind
because the people there showed they can change their nations ...
while we stuck to the apparatus. ...
   ``I am not saying that Gorbachev is the only one responsible for
a slowdown in reforms. But he must be more determined and
efficient; he must make choices.''
   Yeltsin said if the Soviet Communist Party is not radically
reorganized at the next party congress this summer, he will support
the foundation of a new party and a pluralistic political system.
   Yeltsin dodged a question on whether he may try for the Soviet
presidency. But, he said, ``a change of guard at the top is not
easy but would be necessary if things continue this way.
   ``Certainly nobody quits voluntarily in the Soviet Union.''
   Yeltsin also said he did not agree with the decision of some
Eastern European countries to remove their statues of Vladimir I.
Lenin, the Soviet Communist founder. He also criticized calls by
some Soviets to take Lenin's body from the mausoleum in Moscow.
   ``Lenin is not my idol. He too made mistakes ... but we must
preserve his memory. ... Certainly, I prefer to have Lenin's
portrait in my office, rather than Gorbachev's,'' he concluded with
a broad smile.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Strike Illegal, Teachers Can Be Fired</HEAD>

   The state attorney general declared
West Virginia's first teacher strike illegal Thursday as the
walkout spread to more than half the schools in the state.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins warned teachers they could be
suspended for a year, fired or charged with a misdemeanor for
walking off the job.
   Despite that warning and the governor's refusal to hold talks
until they go back to class, the 16,000-member teachers' union
voted to walk out in 20 more counties Thursday and in six more by
Monday if the Legislature fails to vote them a pay raise. The union
initially went on strike Wednesday in 10 counties.
   Teachers joined picket lines, blocked bus garages and rallied at
the state Capitol. Authorities arrested seven teachers on charges
of blocking school buses in Kanawha County, and one picket suffered
torn ligaments when she was hit by a parent's car.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton told the Legislature on Wednesday he won't
hold discussions with the teachers until ``calm and reason are
restored and the teaching force returns to the classrooms.''
   ``This state government will not conduct its affairs under
intimidation,'' he said to a standing ovation.
   West Virginia Education Association President Kayetta Meadows
said her group is willing to meet with the governor but is not
ready to call off the strike.
   The association, which represents 73 percent of the state's
22,000 public school teachers, says average teacher pay in the
state was $21,904, 49th in the nation, before a 5 percent pay raise
last month. Mississippi is 50th.
   The West Virginia Federation of Teachers, which represents 3,000
teachers, said 90 percent of its members also were on strike.
   State law does not permit teachers to engage in collective
bargaining, andthe attorney general said ``a strike or work
stoppage by teachers constitutes an attack upon the most important
duty and function of this state.''
   ``There is no right to strike against the state,'' his opinion
said. ``Thus, any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public
teachers of this state is illegal.''
   Tompkins said it is a misdemeanor for any state officials to
neglect or refuse to perform their duties, or to interrupt a school
or loiter on school grounds. Teachers can be barred for one year
for neglecting their duty by striking, he said.
   By early Thursday evening, no teachers had been arrested or
suspended for staying off the job, authorities said.
   An agreement with legislators on a 5 percent raise for teachers
collapsed Tuesday when the union refused to rule out a strike.
   House Speaker Chuck Chambers and Senate President Keith Burdette
said the strike threat made it impossible for them to win passage
of the raise, which would have been financed by a new $1 per ton
minimum tax on coal production.
   More than 1,000 sign-toting teachers rallied at the Statehouse
urging lawmakers and the governor to provide teachers with a pay
raise.
   ``We think we can do more here, if we talk to our legislators
and get the governor to talk to us,'' said Jane McNeill Laraba, a
teacher at Raleigh County's Liberty High School.
   ``The people in Raleigh County can't help us. The people who can
do anything for us are here.''
   ``I came to school today with tears in my eyes,'' said Becky
Wallace, a physical education teacher at Anne Bailey Elementary
School in St. Albans. ``I've been here 12 years. My kids are
special. When I think of the kids crossing the road here with us
picketing, it's distressing.''
   She said teachers are fed up with the governor and the
Legislature.
   ``This is a message to the Legislature and governor,'' Wallace
said. ``I think the governor's misguided.''

   John M. Poindexter lied to Congress and ripped
up a key presidential document to ``rewrite the history of the
Iran-Contra affair,'' a prosecutor argued Thursday at the start of
the former national security adviser's trial. Poindexter's lawyer
said he was only following Ronald Reagan's orders.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb also told jurors former White House aide
Oliver North, expected on the witness stand Friday, will testify
that on Poindexter's instructions ``he lied and he lied and he
lied'' to Congress by denying the Reagan administration was
secretly helping the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Webb said Poindexter later congratulated North on lies that the
prosecutor said ``worked like a charm.''
   But defense attorney Richard Beckler denied that Poindexter ever
lied to Congress, and he told jurors: ``Admiral Poindexter always
followed the orders of President Reagan.''
   Poindexter tore up a ``presidential finding'' that authorized a
1985 arms shipment to Iran only ``because he felt he was protecting
the president,'' Beckler said, echoing testimony Poindexter gave
Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``What was driving this man was not a conspiracy, but what was
driving this man was the orders of the president of the United
States,'' Beckler said.
   Poindexter ``met with him sometimes seven days a week, sometimes
four, five and six times a day. And he was carrying out the
policies of the United States and that is what this case is about.
It is not about criminality.''
   Poindexter worked to help arm the Contras when Congress shut off
military assistance because ``through hell or high water, Reagan
wanted support to continue,'' the defense lawyer said.
   Reagan ``wanted it done within the law and it was done within
the law,'' Beckler said, telling jurors he will play videotapes of
the former president's testimony taken last month in Los Angeles.
   As the proceedings got under way, U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene dealt the defense a setback, ruling that when North
is called to testify, prosecutors may ask him about seeing
Poindexter rip up the Reagan finding.
   The judge also suggested that North had changed his story on
that subject.
   North testified at his trial last year that he saw Poindexter
destroy the politically embarrassing document, but at a Dec. 13
pre-trial hearing in the Poindexter case he testified he realized
it was the finding that Poindexter had ripped up only after
watching Poindexter's congressional testimony on national
television in 1987.
   ``North appears to have embarked at that time upon the
calculated course of attempting to assist his former colleague and
co-defendant ... by prevaricating on various issues,'' Greene said.
   The document stated that the arms sale was part of a plan to
gain release of the hostages.
   The case is about ``coverup, deception and concealment,'' Webb
told the jurors who will decide on the five felony charges facing
Poindexter, who served as Reagan's top adviser on national security
matters from late 1985 to late 1986.
   Poindexter and North tried to cover up a 1985 shipment of U.S.
arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels
to ``avoid tarnishment of the Reagan administration,'' Webb said.
   ``John Poindexter and Oliver North decided to rewrite the
history of the Iran-Contra affair,'' he said, after it was exposed
in the fall of 1986.
   ``Oliver North and John Poindexter did not like what the true
historical facts were'' because they showed that Reagan broke his
pledge not to sell arms to Iran for the release of U.S. hostages,
Webb said.
   ``They did not want the Iran-Contra events as they occurred to
be revealed,'' Webb said. ``But they got caught.''
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, obstruction, and making
false statements to Congress about the U.S.-Iran arms sales and the
Reagan administration's covert support of the Contras at a time
direct military aid was banned by Congress.
   Webb told jurors North will testify that at Poindexter's
direction he lied to the House Intelligence Committee on Aug. 6,
1986, when questioned about whether the White House was secretly
helping arm the Contras.
   The lies ``worked like a charm'' to falsely reassure congressmen
that the White House was not circumventing the ban on U.S. military
aid to the rebels, Webb said.
   ``Once Admiral Poindexter found out how successful North was in
lying, what did he do? He congratulates North,'' Webb said. ``He
sends him a note that says `Well Done.'''
   Beckler argued that Poindexter was merely ``telling Oliver North
he did a good job.'' None of the evidence ``will show it was done
as an act to perpetuate a conspiracy to keep information from
Congress.''
   North, at his own trial last year, admitted that he lied during
the Aug. 6 meeting, but said he did not know he was breaking the
law when he did so.
   He was acquitted of a charge pertaining to the meeting, but was
convicted of three others including aiding and abetting obstruction
of Congress and altering and destroying government documents.
   Poindexter destroyed it on Nov. 21, 1986 _ eight days after
``Ronald Reagan was on television addressing the nation, telling
the country what we were doing in Iran had nothing to do with
selling arms and swapping them for hostages,'' Webb said.
   Also, Poindexter ripped it up just hours after telling lawmakers
that he knew nothing of the November 1985 missile shipment until
five weeks after it occurred.
   Beckler argued that when Poindexter testified in Congress about
the shipment, he had forgotten when he had learned about it.
   ``After 30 years in the U.S. Navy and the White House they want
to nail him on a five-week mistake,'' Beckler said, his voice
rising.

<HEAD>Timber Harvested from National Forests Falls 5 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of national forests lost money
on timber sales last year, the government said Thursday in a report
that environmentalists say support their call to roll back
subsidized timber sales.
   The U.S. Forest Service, in its annual report on timber sales
from the nation's wilderness, said profits on all the national
forests rose 4 percent last year even though the total harvest
declined about 5 percent.
   There were 11.9 billion board feet of timber harvested from
national forests last year, after 12.6 billion board feet were
harvested in 1988 and a record 12.7 billion board feet the year
before.
   Overall, the Forest Service said the government took in $1.5
billion through timber sales in 1989. Operating expenses for the
timber sales program were $776.7 million last year and the
government paid states $339.1 million for a net sales gain of
$402.7 million _ up from $388.6 million the previous year.
   The timber sale program, in which private companies pay the
federal government for the right to harvest trees and a portion
goes to states to build roads and schools, generated about 132,371
jobs and $4.4 billion in personal income in fiscal 1989, the Forest
Service said.
   Of the nation's 122 national forests, 66 of them lost money by
selling timber at below cost, the report said.
   But George Leonard, associate chief of the service, said those
66 forests account for only 18 percent of the total volume of
timber cut, or about 2 billion board feet.
   ``The forests where we lost the money are the small forests,''
he said. ``Oregon and Washington are responsible for about half the
revenue and they produce about half the timber.''
   Timber industry leaders said the net gain in sales shows the
program is in good shape, but environmentalists said the losses on
the majority of the forests show the government is subsidizing
private logging activities.
   ``The hundreds of millions of dollars the Forest Service loses
on subsidized timber sales are nothing more than public welfare for
the logging industry,'' said Tom Kuhnle, an economist for the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   He said the report should aid the Bush administration's proposal
to slowly eliminate subsidized sales at 12 national forests.
   But David Ford, vice president of the Public Timber Council of
the National Forest Products Association, said the report proves
the program's ``financial soundness.
   ``The timber program is rare among federal programs in that it
consistently earns money for the government,'' he said.
   The Pacific Northwest harvested by far the largest volume of
timber last year with 5.2 billion board feet.
   Only the Pacific Northwest and Southwest among the service's
eight regions posted actual profits last year based on timber sales
after payments were made to states for such things as schools and
roads.

<TEXT>
   Oliver North has changed his story in the
Iran-Contra affair, ``prevaricating'' in an attempt to help his
former boss, the judge in John Poindexter's trial contended
Thursday.
   The accusation that North had lied under oath _ a contention
that could suggest further legal problems for him _ preceded his
expected leadoff appearance as a government witness against
Poindexter, his former superior at the Reagan administration's
National Security Council.
   Poindexter's lawyers tried to bar North's testimony. However,
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene ruled that prosecutors
could ask North to testify _ as he did at his own trial _ that on
Nov. 21, 1986, he witnessed Poindexter tear up a document signed by
President Reagan. The December 1985 ``finding'' depicted U.S.
involvement in arms sales to Iran as a straight arms-for-hostages
deal.
   North testified at his trial that he saw Poindexter destroy the
politically embarrassing document, but the judge said North gave
different testimony at a Dec. 13 pre-trial hearing in the
Poindexter case.
   At the hearing, North said he only realized it was the finding
that Poindexter had ripped up after watching Poindexter's
congressional testimony on national television in 1987.
   No portion of the prosecution's case may be derived from that
Poindexter testimony, which was given under a grant of immunity.
   ``The Court rejects as totally incredible the suggestion that an
eyewitness to the almost ceremonial destruction of a state paper
such as a signed Presidential Finding would not know that he had
been such an eyewitness,'' said the judge.
   In a footnote, the judge said that ``since North has changed his
testimony several times, a further recantation can obviously not be
excluded.''
   The judge said the former White House aide was trying to avoid
having to testify against his former boss when he made the
statements at the hearing. North said at the time that Poindexter
was the only one in the Iran-Contra affair who ``didn't hang Ollie
North out to dry.''
   ``North appears to have embarked at that time upon the
calculated course of attempting to assist his former colleague and
co-defendant ... by prevaricating on various issues,'' Greene said.
   ``North told the truth at his trial rather than at the December
13, 1989 hearing,'' the judge concluded.
   Poindexter's lawyers asserted that North testified reluctantly
about how his memory was affected by Poindexter's immunized
testimony, but Greene disagreed.
   North's ``insistence on having been heavily influenced by that
testimony was enthusiastic rather than reluctant,'' said the judge.
   At the December hearing, North ``repeatedly claimed that he
could not distinguish between his own observations and the version
of events described in another's testimony; yet ... it is unlikely
that a witness who was a participant in the events as they
occurred, could not make such a distinction.''
   At his trial, North testified that ``I saw the finding torn up
... I saw him tear it in two.''
   In December, the former White House aide said:
   ``I don't know for a fact'' that the document was the finding,
``except what Admiral Poindexter testified to, that the document
that was destroyed that morning, or afternoon, or whenever it was,
was indeed the finding.''
   North was convicted of three felonies, including aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress in connection with the November
1985 shipment of Hawks which now figures so prominently in the
Poindexter case.
   Poindexter destroyed the finding hours after he is alleged to
have told members of the House and Senate intelligence committees
that he hadn't known about the missile shipment until January 1986.
His alleged statements to the committees form the basis for four of
the five criminal charges against him.
   The government says it will contend at Poindexter's trial that
his knowledge of the signed presidential finding was his motive for
concealing U.S. involvement in the Hawk missile shipment.

<HEAD>Expert Says Helmsman Didn't Turn Far Enough To Miss Reef</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground on a
jagged reef and spilled its cargo of oil because the helmsman
failed to turn the ship as far as he was ordered, an expert
testified Thursday on behalf of the tanker's skipper.
   Peter Shizume, who devised a complex computer program used to
simulate ship accidents, said the tanker would have gone past Bligh
Reef in Prince William with room to spare if the rudder had been
turned only half as far as called for by the third mate.
   ``I think the problem was the rudder was initiated late and not
enough rudder was used,'' Shizume testified at the criminal trial
of fired Exxon skipper Joseph Hazelwood in the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Shizume, who said he used various formulas to track the course
of the tanker, said it would have missed Bligh Reef by about two
miles if the helmsman had turned 10 degrees right about 10 minutes
before the ship ran aground and spilled nearly 11 million gallons
of crude oil.
   Shizume, from Hicksville, N.Y., said as little as 5 degrees less
than five minutes before the accident also would have saved the
ship.
   The third mate, who was in control of the Exxon Valdez while
Hazelwood went to his cabin, testified earlier in the trial that 10
minutes before the accident he called for the helmsman to execute
10 degrees right rudder.
   The mate suggested that the helmsman, Robert Kagan, failed to
follow the order because he had problems with steering and had once
been reprimanded for steering too hard.
   Shizume said his study of the ship's course recorder showed that
Kagan's average turn during the critical period was 4 degrees.
   ``What is your opinion as to what he was doing,'' asked attorney
Michael Chalos.
   ``He looks like he was swinging the rudder back and forth,''
apparently without any commands to do so, Shizume said.
   Shizume, a physicist and engineer retired from Sperry Gyroscope
Co., said he was hired to create the mock-up system used at the
National Maritime Research Center at Kings Point, N.Y. The system
is used for training captains and studying shipping accidents.
   Hazelwood, 43, is on trial on four criminal counts stemming from
the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound.
He faces up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted
on all four counts.
   In other testimony, a naval architect challenged the testimony
of a prosecution expert, saying the Exxon Valdez wouldn't have sunk
if Hazelwood had been able to work it off the reef immediately
after the spill.
   The prosecution contends that by engaging the engines and
turning the rudder from side to side, Hazelwood put the ship in
danger of capsizing and further damaged the part of the tanker that
was resting on rock.
   Edward Hoffman, the naval architect, said Hazelwood's crew would
have been able to keep the ship from capsizing by transferring sea
water into oil tanks to balance the ship's load.
   Hoffman also testified that he examined the wrecked Exxon Valdez
at its dry dock in San Diego and concluded that Hazelwood's actions
after it went aground didn't further damage to the tanker.
   ``My opinion is that the explosive impact with the ship and the
reef caused the majority of damage,'' Hoffman said. ``Subsequent to
that, the rise and fall of the tide caused further damage.''
   Hoffman led off the second day of defense testimony after
Hazelwood's lawyers moved to center stage in the criminal trial.

   The mastermind of a plot to extort $10
million from the Du Pont Co. in exchange for documents stolen from
its Lycra plant in Argentina was sentenced Wednesday to 6{ years in
federal prison.
   U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Longobardi sentenced two of
52-year-old Bruno Skerianz's accomplices, Raul Armando Giordano,
37, and Antonio Ruben Inigo, 40, to 3{ years.
   Longobardi also ordered the three to serve three years probation
and pay $100 to a Du Pont compensation fund.
   Prosecutors said Du Pont, a Wilmington-based chemicals
manufacturer, was given the choice of paying $10 million for the
documents or having them sold to a competitor. The documents were
stolen from Du Pont's Lycra plant in Mercedes, Argentina.
   Lycra is Du Pont's trade name for spandex, an elastic fiber used
in such clothing as swimsuits and leotards.
   A jury convicted the three Argentines in December on one count
each of conspiracy to extort and attempted extortion. Each count
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine
and five year's probation.
   A fourth defendant, Jose Petrosino, is fighting extradition from
Italy. Charges against Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini, who testified
for the prosecution, were dropped.
   Before passing sentence, the judge rejected a defense motion to
dismiss the case.
   ``We're asking for as much leniency as possible, based on their
level of participation'' in the scheme, said Giordano's lawyer,
John S. Malik.
   Prosecutors said Du Pont also reached an agreement in which
Skerianz and his co-defendants pledged not to work in spandex
production for five years and Du Pont would sell spandex yarn for
five years to a company chosen by Skerianz.
   The defense claimed Skerianz had not attempted extortion because
he and his cohorts had planned to manufacture spandex for Radicci,
an Italian textile manufacturer.
   Skerianz had worked for Du Pont more than 20 years ago, and the
others resigned in the fall of 1988 from the Mercedes plant.
   All except Petrosini were arrested in February 1989 in Geneva
after an aborted attempt to return the documents for $10 million.
Petrosino was arrested several months later.
   Du Pont controls more than half the spandex market worldwide,
and sold more than $600 million of the product in 1988.

   T. Timothy Ryan Jr., former chief attorney in
the Labor Department, is the Treasury Department's choice to
replace M. Danny Wall as the nation's top savings and loan
regulator, an administration source said Thursday.
   Ryan, 44, is an attorney with the Washington firm of Reed,
Smith, Shaw and McClay. He served as solicitor of the Labor
Department from 1981 to 1983, directing a staff of about 600
lawyers.
   After a three-month search, the Treasury Department has
recommended that President Bush appoint Ryan to head the
department's Office of Thrift Supervision, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The department, which assumed responsibility for the thrift
office as part of the S&amp;L bailout enacted in August, had at first
sought an experienced regulator for the post but could not find an
acceptable candidate willing to take the job.
   William Taylor, chief of banking supervision for the Federal
Reserve System, opted to stay with his higher-paying current job.
Frederick Wolf, former No. 2 official at Congress' General
Accounting Office, withdrew after the Treasury Department failed to
forward his name to the White House.
   In private practice, Ryan has specialized in pension and
employee benefit law rather than in financial institution
regulation. However, the administration source said Ryan would
bring a fresh approach and strong leadership and management skills
to the thrift director's job at a critical time in the industry.
   ``He's someone who has a high degree of professionalism as well
as a real sense of what's practical,'' said Martin McGuinn, vice
chairman and general counsel of the Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank.
``I've seen his organizational skills at work.'' Ryan has performed
legal work for Mellon and went to college with McGuinn.
   Ryan is an active Republican. He served as an attorney in both
the 1976 campaign of Gerald Ford and Bush's 1988 campaign. He was
the legal counsel for the 1980 Reagan-Bush transistion team.
   It was unclear how soon the White House could complete routine
background checks on Ryan. For other appointments, the process has
taken several months. Barring an unforseen development, President
Bush was expected to accept the Treasury's recommendation.
   Congressional Democrats, who were backing Wolf, have repeatedly
criticized the administration for not naming a thrift director
sooner. Wall announced his resignation Dec. 4. He stayed on until
Tuesday, when President Bush named Assistant Treasury Secretary
Salvatore Martoche as acting director.
   The administration has been anxious to find a permanent
successor to Wall, hoping to stifle legal challenges from weak
thrifts facing government seizure. Olympic Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Berwyn, Ill., is contending in U.S. District Court
that both Wall and Martoche lacked the legal authority to close
insolvent thrifts because they were not confirmed for the position
by the Senate.
   Wall inherited the post after Congress dismantled the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, where he was chairman. He resigned after a
series of grueling House Banking Committee hearings where he was
criticized for his handling of the failure of Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. Martoche was confirmed for his
Treasury job, but not as thrift director.

<HEAD>Slovenia Proclaims Economic Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's liberal northern
republic of Slovenia on Thursday declared economic independence
from the federation, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
   Tanjug said the Slovene Parliament also decided it would not
fulfill the portion of its financial obligations toward the
federation that are earmarked for the less prosperous republic of
Serbia and the least developed region of Kosovo, which is an
administrative part of Serbia.
   ``The Republic of Slovenia will independently adopt measures of
economic self-protection, regardless of the obligations of the
federal legislation,'' read a declaration adopted by the parliament.
   ``(It) will independently take decisions on fulfilment of its
obligations toward the Socialist Republic of Serbia and the
Federation.''
   Serbia, the largest republic, cut all official and trade ties
with Slovenia in December after authorities there banned a rally by
Serbs seeking to oust the Slovene leadership.
   The Communist leadership and partisan press in Serbia have
lashed out against Slovenia, accusing it of ``treason'' for
criticizing Serbia's policies in ethnically troubled Kosovo
province.
   Serbian authorities accuse Slovenia of harboring separatist
tendencies and protecting its own interests at the expense of
federal ones.
   Slovenian authorities deny it and say Serbia is trying to
politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by
introducing greater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of
the republics.
   The Slovene Parliament decided on Wednesday to drop the word
``Socialist'' from Slovenia's official name as part of its drive to
distance itself from old Communist symbols and dogmas that still
prevail elsewhere in the country.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces. It has a population of about 23{ million.

<HEAD>Two Yemen Leaders Meet on Border, Hints They Might Speed Unity</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SAN`A, North Yemen (AP) _ The leaders of North and South Yemen
met Thursday in a border city to discuss plans for merging their
two countries, and reports indicated they may speed the unification
process ahead of the November deadline.
   The Saudi Arabian newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported this week
that the two leaders would concentrate their new talks on joining
military and security forces.
   The meeting, held in this country's southern city of Taiz, was
the fourth between the two leaders since they announced the
intended merger last November. The two countries abut one another
on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
   Thursday's session again brought together President Ali Abdullah
Saleh of North Yemen and the secretary-general of the ruling Yemeni
Socialist Party in South Yemen, Ali Salem al-Beidh.
   They earlier agreed to put a unified constitution to their
legislative bodies within six months and to a national referendum
in both countries before Nov. 30.
   But Saleh was quoted recently as saying the full merger could be
declared much earlier than Nov. 30.
   Diplomatic sources said the two leaders may be interested in a
quicker union because of economic problems in their countries,
particularly South Yemen.
   South Yemen, which pursued a Marxist policy since independence
in 1967, has been wracked for months by labor strikes over the
country's economic woes.

   President Najib of Afghanistan said
Thursday that the military has been purged of mutinous soldiers,
but the renegade general who led a bloody coup attempt said from
hiding he would keep fighting.
   Radio Kabul put the death toll at 56 and said 200 people were
injured in fighting since Tuesday's air raid over Kabul. Some
travelers who witnessed the attacks said civilian casualties
appeared low considering the ferocity of the battles.
   The normally bustling markets of the capital opened again
Thursday, and the war-weary city was reported calm. Questions
surfaced about the strength and loyalty of the Afghan air force,
the key factor in Najib's survival since the Soviet Union pulled
its troops out of Afghanistan last year.
   Shah Nawaz Tanai, who as defense minister launched the coup try,
said in a taped message to his supporters Thursday: ``We have risen
and our struggle will continue.''
   Tanai defected Wednesday to the Moslem guerrillas battling
Najib's government, but guerrilla leaders made clear Thursday they
have no desire to join forces with the hard-line Marxist.
   ``He's no different than Najib. How can we extend our support to
a Communist?'' said Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the radical
Islamic Ittehad faction and prime minister of the guerrillas'
government in exile.
   Radio Kabul said Najib replaced Tenai as defense minister
Tuesday and dismissed him Thursday from the Supreme Defense Council.
   Four other council members also were replaced because of
``national dishonesty,'' said the radio, monitored in Islamabad.
They were identified as Niaz Mohammad Momand and Mir Sahib Karwal,
both Politburo members; Gen. Nazar Mohammad, an alternate member of
the Politburo and a former defense minister; and Gen. Sayed Aqa
Aka, a brigadier general who fled to Pakistan on Wednesday.
   According to the radio, Najib declared that mutinous troops had
been purged from the armed forces.
   And a diplomat based in Kabul quoted the president as telling a
news conference: ``The microbes, the radicals among us, have been
cleansed. We don't have any more factions. We are more united than
ever.''
   According to the diplomat, who refused to be identified further,
Najib said pro-Tanai soldiers had been killed, arrested or had
surrendered. He again declared his government was strong and urged
Western nations to revise their pro-resistance policies.
   In his message, Tanai said he was inside Afghanistan but he did
not say where.
   ``I am sending this cassette with my friend outside to be
broadcast to you,'' he said in comments translated by the
guerrillas' news agency from Dari into English.
   ``This is a call for Afghanistan's Moslem people and the army
and the real party members. Najib and his dictatorship will fall.
For this and for national unity, we have risen up.''
   The tape was played to reporters, who recognized Tanai's voice
from military briefings, news conferences, and television
appearances.
   Tanai was in at least temporary alliance with one of the most
radical guerrilla leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, the moderate president of the
guerrillas' exile government, rejected the Tanai-Hekmatyar
alliance. ``We do not have any understanding or solidarity with
either,'' he said.
   Tanai and Hekmatyar were bitter rivals during the 12 years of
war after the 1978 coup that installed a Communist government in
Afghanistan. Tanai had opposed Najib's propsals to talk peace with
the guerrillas, and Hekmatyar said he would only support an Islamic
government in Afghanistan.
   They appeared united in their desire to see Najib ousted.
   When the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan in February 1989
after nine years of military intervention, many governments,
including the United States and Soviet Union, predicted Najib's
government would collapse within weeks or months.
   But the Afghan armed forces held their ground, largely because
of the Afghan air force.
   This week's fighting resulted in heavy losses to air force
aircraft, said one Western diplomat.
   ``The air force was Najib's only card. It's unlikely it will get
back the strength it had anytime soon,'' said the diplomat in
Islamabad, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Tanai, a battle-hardened soldier popular among rank-and-file
Afghan soldiers, launched the coup attempt from Bagram, the
country's largest air base about 30 miles north of Kabul.
   About a half-dozen warplanes swooped down on the capital,
dropping bombs around the presidential palace and near crowded
markets and residential areas in the old section, according to
diplomatic sources in Kabul and Islamabad.
   ``I was very scared,'' said Harinder Singh, an Afghan who was
among 150 passengers aboard a Kabul-New Delhi flight on Thursday,
the first flight since the attempted coup. ``All of us thought we
were going to die. A bomb exploded in a taxi near me and I saw the
driver being blown apart.''
   According to sources in Kabul, the last bombs were dropped on
the city Wednesday morning as pro-Tanai soldiers battled troops
loyal to Najib at Bagram.
   In Moscow, Soviet television said late Thursday that five
artillery shells landed on Soviet Embassy grounds during the Kabul
fighting, but no one was hurt. It said nothing about damage.
   The Soviet TV reporter said a majority of the military backs
Najib and reported most of Afghanistan was quiet, but he said the
situation in the near future is ``not simple.'' He said Tanai is
from the Khost region and is likely to use his connections there.

   Black leader Nelson Mandela
switched plans Thursday and flew to this capital to thank
ambassadors to the Organization of African Unity for their years of
support.
   Interrupting a scheduled six-day visit to Tanzania, the new vice
president of the African National Congress hastily changed his
itinerary to address the envoys from across the continent.
   Mandela has received invitations to visit dozens of countries
since his release four weeks ago from a South African prison where
he was serving a life sentence for sabotage and treason.
   Mandela had been in prison since 1962, when he was sentenced to
five years for leaving the country illegally and organizing an
illegal strike by blacks. While serving that sentence he was
convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white
government.
   By changing his schedule to address ambassadors to the
Organization of African Unity at its headquarters in Ethiopia's
capital, Mandela found a way to thank many countries at once for
supporting him and his group.
   For years, the Organization of African Unity has been calling
for Mandela's release and condemning the white minority government
of South Africa for its policies of racial separation known as
apartheid.
   Mandela's speech to the ambassadors was scheduled Friday morning
after a meeting with officials of the group. Then he was to fly
back to Tanzania to visit African National Congress training camps
for guerrillas before leaving for Sweden on Sunday.
   Mandela flew to Addis Ababa from Zanzibar, the semi-autonomous
island off Tanzania's east coast. He spoke at a public rally there,
met island officials and laid a wreath on the tomb of Abeid Amani
Karume, Zanzibar's first president who was assassinated in 1972.

   President Bush last month returned a call to
talk about U.S. hostages to a man he was told was Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, but the call turned out to be a hoax, the White
House said Thursday.
   ``This was the first time this has happened,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said the government has no idea who was behind the hoax.
   Fitzwater and other White House officials said that Bush placed
the call after a man identifying himself as an Iranian government
official called the White House to say that Rafsanjani wanted to
talk to Bush about U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``The call came in, a number was given for us to call. We were
suspicious and began checking,'' Fitzwater said. ``But, ultimately,
the president needed to make the call as part of the check. He did
make the call.''
   The call, first reported by CBS News, came to a staff member of
the White House National Security Council, aides said.
   ``The president has made it known he's willing to talk to Iran
at any time,'' Fitzwater said. ``And the ball is in their court.''
   The Bush administration has contended that Rafsanjani's
government has influence with the captors of eight Americans and
citizens of 10 European countries being held in Lebanon.
   Fitzwater said that the administration has let Rafsanjani know
``through diplomatic channels as well as publicly, that we're
willing to talk whenever they're ready. And they have come back and
said, `We're not ready.'''
   The caller said the Iranian president wanted to speak to Bush,
and ``various methods were used to check'' the legitimacy of the
call, said another White House aide, Stephen Hart.
   Since the president ``has stated he would talk to anybody if it
would help free the hostages,'' Bush agreed to talk to Rafsanjani,
Hart said.
   Fitzwater and Hart declined to answer further questions about
the affair, such as how the hoax was discovered or what Bush said
to the caller.
   Asked if Bush immediately realized that the voice on the other
end of the line was not Rafsanjani, Fitzwater said: ``I can't tell
you how we determined it was a hoax.''
   He said he didn't want to get into anything ``that goes to the
point of how we check out phone calls.''
   However, he indicated that the person on the other end of the
line did not identify himself as a hoaxer.
   CBS said the call came first to Brent Scowcroft, national
security adviser to the president, and was checked out by ``various
intelligence methods.''
   In his conversation with the unknown caller, the president
``repeated U.S. policy that goodwill will beget goodwill but there
could be no quid pro quo for U.S. hostages,'' the network said.
   Bush first used the phrase ``goodwill will beget goodwill'' in
his inaugural address 14 months ago.
   Recent days have seen a flurry of speculative stories about
whether the hostages might be freed, and the White House has said
it was encouraged by recent comments of Rafsanjani to the effect
that a solution might be achieved soon.
   The Tehran Times, a newspaper close to Iran's president, said in
an editorial that 1990 would be the last year of captivity for the
hostages.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Tuesday ``we are
encouraged by the fact that there is speculation'' about a release
of the hostages. ``Let's see if that speculation proves out.''
   The White House has said it was not negotiating directly with
Iran, and it has said it would make no deals for the freedom of the
hostages. But ``a great deal is being done that is not
publicized,'' said Mike Kraft, an official in the State
Department's counter-terrorism office, on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   An Air Force lieutenant accused of
having sex with a sergeant at a Titan 2 missile silo was acquitted
Wednesday by an eight-man military jury.
   ``Thank God!'' 2nd Lt. Naomi Haye's attorney, Morgan ``Chip''
Welch, yelled when the verdict was read after two hours of
deliberations. Mrs. Haye dropped into her chair and sobbed quietly
as supporters applauded.
   ``I'm speechless,'' Mrs. Haye, 33, told reporters Wednesday. ``I
always planned on the worst and hoped for the best. It's easier to
expect the worst. It's too defeating to get the other way around.''
   Air Force officials said Mrs. Haye may be entitled to about
$75,000 in back pay withheld since she was first charged in 1986
with fraternizaion and adultery.
   She was convicted that year of adultery and fraternization, but
the verdict was overturned by military appeals courts. Prosecutors
retried her on charges of fraternization, claiming she had sex four
times with Sgt. Thomas Bush, at their homes, at a hotel and at a
missile silo while he was on duty.
   Mrs. Haye now lives in Guam with her husband, Patrick, an Air
Force sergeant.
   The president of the jury, Col. Liegel John, said he found Bush
unreliable.
   ``There was a lot of inconsistencies and not enough there to
prove her guilty,'' John said. ``There was no smoking gun.''
   Prosecutor Capt. Derek Hill had argued that Mrs. Haye and her
husband tried to cover up the alleged affair, and said she declined
to deny the charge until several weeks after she talked to her
attorneys.
   The defense said Bush, who has married four times, used his
marital problems to get close to female acquaintances.
   Welch said Bush was ``hustling women through an approach that's
as old as the hills _ `My wife doesn't understand me.' He wants
counseling. He wants them to mother him.
   ``He's the only witness to allege sexual misconduct,'' Welch
said. ``I'll be the first to tell you I believe Mr. Bush is guilty
of sexual misconduct. I just don't know with whom.''
   In his closing argument, Hill said there was no reason for an
enlisted man to lie about having an affair with an officer.
   Welch also took aim at prosecution witnesses who supported
Bush's testimony.
   A prosecution witnesss, Staff Sgt. Kim Wilkinson, testified
earlier in the week that she caught Bush and Mrs. Haye in an
embrace. But two defense witnesses testified Monday that Ms.
Wilkinson joked and talked often about sex.
   ``She saw sex behind every door and every glance and every
nuance,'' Welch said.
   Six of the eight jurors were needed to cast guilty votes to
convict Mrs. Haye under military law, but the actual vote was not
released Wednesday. Mrs. Haye would have faced dismissal from the
Air Force if found guilty.

   A tanker smashed into a tug boat
and dumped thousands of gallons of fuel oil into an ocean reserve
for rare fish along Brazil's southeastern Atlantic coast, officials
said Wednesday.
   The spill occurred Monday night in the marine reserve of Angra
dos Reis, 94 miles southwest of Rio, said Elcio Pires, a spokesman
for the Rio state environmental agency.
   The Jacui tanker, owned by the government-run oil monopoly
Petrobras, rammed the docked tug boat at an oil unloading terminal,
Pires said in a telephone interview.
   He said 10,400 gallons of oil spilled from a 10-inch gash in the
tanker's hull, coating the pristine waters with a thick film.
   ``The oil blackened at least 13 kilometers (8 miles) of beaches
in four islands. Some beach areas on the mainland were also hit,''
Pires said.
   He said cleanup crews with skimmers were working around the
clock to contain the slick but that rough tides were carrying the
oil out to sea. Only 60 percent of the oil would be recovered,
Pires said.
   The ecological damage to the reserve, home to thousands of
species of rare fish and marine fauna, would not be known for
several weeks, he said.
   Rio state Gov. Wellington Moreira Franco told a news conference
that the oil terminal would be shut down for ``an indefinite time
until security measures against future spills are taken.''
   ``It would be impossible not to punish such continued acts of
irresponsibility,'' he said.
   Petrobras was fined $1,000 for the spill and the terminal will
be monitored when it reopens, Franco said. He said 30 ecological
accidents have occurred at the terminal since 1983.

   A man fired shots at random as he drove
around the city Thursday morning, hitting a newspaper delivery man
in the head and wounding at least seven other men before police
arrested him, authorities said.
   ``Each and every one of these shootings had no apparent
motive,'' said police Lt. Mike McKenna.
   Police recovered a revolver, the fresh carcass of a goose and a
package the suspect said was a bomb from his red station wagon,
McKenna said. Police confirmed the bundle was an incendiary device,
he said.
   A major street was closed for more than three hours and
businesses were evacuated while a police bomb squad removed the
package and took it to a rural area for detonation.
   There were at least 10 shooting incidents in east Wichita in a
little more than an hour starting around 4:30 a.m., McKenna said.
Some of the shootings were nearly 10 miles apart.
   Two of the injured were hit by bullets and the rest by flying
glass, police said.
   The toll could have been much higher had the rampage occurred 90
minutes later as morning rush hour traffic built, police said.
   The suspect was arrested after he stopped at a fast-food
restaurant that hadn't opened yet, and police seeking his station
wagon surrounded him.
   The 50-year-old suspect, who has a history of violence, was
taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation, McKenna said. The man
was being held without bond, and hadn't been charged.
   William F. Brown, a 41-year-old employee of The Wichita Eagle,
was shot once in the back of the head as he was stocking a
coin-operated newspaper box outside a restaurant.
   Brown was listed in extremely critical condition Thursday night
at HCA Wesley Medical Center.
   Allen T. Cox, 54, of Kechi was hospitalized in good condition
with a bullet wound to the jaw that cost him several teeth.
   The other victims were cut by flying glass and didn't suffer
gunshot wounds, McKenna said. Four men were treated at hospitals
and released, another was treated by ambulance attendants and a
sixth refused treatment.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
sought to calm fears among the NATO allies on Thursday by promising
to keep them fully informed on plans to forge a new German state.
   In what was seen as a dramatic gesture to the alliance, Kohl
traveled to the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to meet for nearly three hours with ambassadors and
other officials of the 16 nations.
   Afterward, he told reporters, ``Nobody has to be concerned that
the Germans would one way or the other want to go it alone.''
   ``This was a very important event for me. We've had a very
frank, a very open conversation.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former defense
minister in Bonn, called the closed-door talks ``very intensive,
constructive, fruitful and lively _ also very friendly.''
   He said the discussions marked the start of a ``formal sequence
of consultations inside this alliance'' on the issue of German
unification and the security questions this posed.
   He said the allies unanimously supported efforts to join the two
Germanys and agreed the unified state should remain in NATO. He
said they welcomed the resolution adopted Thursday by the Bonn
Parliament calling for a united Germany to honor Poland's Western
border.
   Kohl came here to try to stop complaints from NATO nations about
being left out of talks on security aspects of a united Germany.
   Several NATO diplomats, demanding anonymity, praised his
performance here.
   ``It was a tour de force,'' said one. Another said, ``Kohl came
clearly wanting to get things back on track with the European
allies.''
   In an interview later with The Associated Press, Woerner
described Kohl as being ``very frank, not the usual diplomatic
attitude.''
   Other officials said detailed questions were asked about whether
Germany wanted to consult the allies, what its goals were and how
it intended to deal with the current territory of East Germany
after unification. More than 380,000 Soviet troops now are
stationed there.
   The officials said the questions might have been sharper had not
the German legislature dealt with the issue of Poland's borders.
Kohl had drawn fire for his earlier reluctance to unequivocally
state that a united Germany would never lay claim to land ceded to
Poland after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat.
   Kohl told reporters as he left the building:
   ``What is happening in Germany at present must be embedded in
the ... ongoing developments in Europe.
   ``German interests must be taken into account, but also the
interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in East and
West must be taken into account.
   ``This means we need to have talks constantly, that we need to
consult very closely and that we need to cooperate very closely.
That was the idea behind my visit.''
   He said the 40-year-old West German state deserved ``confidence
and trust.''
   Woerner said the allies would be consulted before and after key
meetings of the two Germanys and the four victorious World War II
allies _ Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   He said Soviet troops would likely remain on East German
territory for years after unification.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday it was
``absolutely out of the question'' that a united Germany would
belong to NATO. East Germany is now part of the Warsaw Pact
military alliance. Moscow would like to see a neutral nation formed
by the two Germanys.
   Kohl said events were shaping the drive toward unification. He
said 115,000 to 116,000 East Germans moved to West Germany in
January and February.
   ``We want this process to be stopped,'' he said. ``We want these
people to stay home. We want them to see their future over there.''

   President Daniel Ortega on Thursday
warned of civil war if the U.S-supported Contra rebels fail to
dismantle before April 25, when the administration of Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro is to take over the government.
   In a speech before thousands of people celebrating International
Woman's Day, Ortega repeatedly spoke both of leading the
Sandinistas as an opposition force and about the Sandinistas'
demand that the Contras demobilize in the transition period.
   ``There is a calm like those before the storm,'' Ortega said.
``And we have the obligation of avoiding being swept away by the
tempest of civil war ... popular insurrection ... violence.''
   Ortega said ``thousands of weapons are in the hands of the
people,'' who he said would be willing to defend themselves against
the Contras.
   Since the Feb. 25 elections, there have been reports of weapons
being distributed to civilians nationwide and of people being
trained and organized as Sandinista paramilitary groups called
``sovereignty battalions.''
   ``The situation in the country is very tense, very
complicated,'' Ortega said.
   He said Contras continue to attack in Nicaraguan territory
``with the complicity of the Honduran government and the United
States government.''
   About 10,000 Contras _ most of their force _ are based in
Honduran jungle camps near the Nicaragua border.
   Contra leaders have said they will not lay down their arms and
return to Nicaragua before President-elect Chamorro is inaugurated
and the Sandinista People's Army and the Interior Ministry give
over control of those two institutions to the new government.
   That's something Ortega repeatedly has said the Sandinistas will
not do.
   ``I am convinced that in the same way that the Contras say they
will not disarm ... that the people are willing to grab the arms to
finish the Contras once and for all,'' Ortega said.
   He also said he was not in a position to turn over to Mrs.
Chamorro's United National Opposition alliance the weapons now in
the possession of the army and Interior Ministry.
   ``I don't have any weapons to give up because the weapons belong
to the people,'' Ortega said in his speech.
   He also said the army and Interior Ministry troops, considered a
parallel army, ``are what will give all Nicaraguans security.''
   UNO leaders have accused the Sandinistas of funneling money into
foreign bank accounts. Ortega, however, said in his speech that
citizens have been cleaning out their accounts because of the
increase in tension and uncertainty.
   ``There were millionaire sums deposited in accounts, but as the
situation has become tense, people have been withdrawing their
accounts,'' Ortega said.

   At least three men killed a
truck driver on Thursday in a machine-gun attack claimed by the
Irish Republican Army, and a Protestant paramilitary group said it
killed an IRA backer the day before.
   Two witnesses to Wednesday's attack leveled charges of collusion
between security forces and Protestant paramilitary groups in this
British province.
   The IRA unit in East Tyrone said its members shot the
unidentified driver, who delivered construction materials to police
stations and military bases. It said his employer ignored warnings
to stop working for security forces.
   The IRA has targeted construction firms in an effort to prevent
repairs on bomb damage it inflicts on security bases. The victim's
employer, Henry's of Magherafelt, earlier lost a director in a
shooting and a manager in a bombing.
   Police said the man was driving a concrete mixer when he was
attacked outside Donaghmore village near Dungannon, 40 miles west
of Belfast. The machine-gunners fired at least 30 shots before
fleeing in a car, police said.
   The outlawed Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force on Thursday night
claimed responsibilty for killing Sam Marshall, 31, on Wednesday
shortly after he left the Royal Ulster Constabulary base in Lurgan,
20 miles southwest of Belfast.
   Supporters of the mainly Roman Catholic IRA identified Marshall
as a member of its legal political wing, Sinn Fein. He was
imprisoned from 1976 to 1982 for terrorist offenses, police said.
   Two survivors of the Wednesday night shooting accused police of
cooperating with the gunmen.
   Tony McCaughey, 31, and Colm Duffy, 22, said they were under
police surveillance when the gunmen attacked.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary denied the allegations of
collusion with the killers.
   The three men were out on bail after being charged with illegal
possession of ammunition. One of the bail conditions was that the
three had to report to the Lurgan police station twice a week on
Saturdays and Wednesdays.
   McCaughey and Duffy said the bail conditions were known only by
the police and their lawyers.
   ``Neither of us will be reporting back to the station,''
McCaughey said. ``We would prefer to go back to prison than go back
to the RUC station.''
   Duffy said a car followed them to the police station Wednesday
night and was seen again just after the attack. He said it was an
unmarked police car.
   ``We want Stevens to carry out the investigation, and to come up
with some answers to who owned it,'' Duffy said. ``We have
absolutely no qualms about talking to Stevens.''
   John Stevens, deputy chief constable of Cambridgeshire, was sent
to Northern Ireland in September to investigate a series of leaks
from the Northern Ireland police force of lists of IRA suspects.
   The leaks stirred a furor in the province, the implication being
that secret intelligence is falling into the hands of Protestant
gangs and helping them choose assassination targets.
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins on Thursday called for an
investigation into the new charges of collusion.
   Duffy said soon after leaving the police station Wednesday
night, two masked men armed with rifles pulled up in a red Rover
car and fired 40 shots.
   Police said Marshall was killed instantly. McCaughey and Duffy
were unhurt.
   The British domestic press agency, Press Association, quoted
unidentified sources as saying Marshall had been warned by police
recently that he was on a Protestant paramilitary hit list.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It seeks
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   Women formed a human chain around India's Parliament to demand
equality, and Margaret Thatcher of Britain welcomed Nicaragua's new
president to the select club of female leaders during ceremonies
Thursday for International Women's Day.
   The French saluted women who helped bring change to Eastern
Europe. A visiting U.S. women's leader railed against the social
status of American women.
   Leaders and women's groups around the world joined in the
observances. March 8 was declared Women's Day in 1910 during an
International Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The celebration was adopted by the United Nations in 1975.
   In New Delhi on Thursday, about 2,000 women surrounded the
Parliament building in a human chain. The protesters, many with
clenched fists, called for more opportunities for women and
equality of the sexes.
   One sign carried by a protester said, ``It is not women chain;
it is a human chain.''
   In her comments to the male-dominated British House of Commons,
Prime Minister Thatcher praised the Feb. 25 election in Nicaragua
of newspaper publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   ``How very grateful we are that our small number of heads of
government have been added to by another head of government, a
woman head of government in Nicaragua,'' she said.
   She spoke after rejecting an opposition Labor Party demand to
mark women's day by increasing state payments to mothers of
dependent children.
   In Managua, Nicaragua, outgoing President Daniel Ortega used his
speech marking the day to warn of civil war if the U.S-supported
Contra rebels fail to dismantle before April 25, when Mrs. Chamorro
takes over.
   In Paris, ceremonies honored women who have played major roles
in the fight for democracy in Romania, the Soviet Union and
elsewhere.
   Among those singled out were human rights activists Yelena
Bonner of the Soviet Union and Doina Cornea of Romania, both
targets of government repression for many years.
   A symposium on ``Women and Creation'' sponsored by a year-old
French feminist group, the Women's Alliance For Democratization,
featured a host of international feminist leaders. They included
Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women in the
United States.
   ``International Women's Day demonstrates that everywhere women
are pretty much treated as less than first-class citizens,'' Ms.
Yard said to The Associated Press.
   Asked about the status of women in the United States, Ms. Yard
said ``the picture isn't pretty.''
   ``They lose their jobs, they don't get promoted and they get
harassed on the job. They're denied tenure as professors, they get
beaten up and they get terrible divorce settlements,'' she said.
   Michele Andre, France's deputy minister of women's rights,
saluted the achievements of President Corazon Aquino of the
Philippines and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan.
   She said France will try to provide Romanian hospitals with
materials for contraception and abortion. Romanian women were
forbidden to use contraceptive devices and denied abortions under
the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed during the
December revolution.
   In another address in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar lauded the work of women in special U.N. missions
in Namibia and Nicaragua. He also said more must be done to promote
women in the world body.
   In Beijing, Chen Muhua, head of the All-China Women's
Federation, stressed party allegiance in a reception at the Great
Hall of the People for more than 1,000 prominent women.
   ``Chinese women are convinced that without national liberation,
there would be no women's liberation, and without the Communist
Party and socialism, they would not have won the status they enjoy
today,'' she said.
   Premier Li Peng, who attended the reception, said women ``under
the leadership of the Communist Party will forge ahead to maintain
and further enhance the country's economic and political
stability.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thousands of demonstrators across
Haiti set up flaming tire barricades and burned cars to protest the
army's killing of a schoolgirl. Three people were killed, including
a soldier beaten to death by a mob.
   Two people were hospitalized with bullet wounds and at least 10
others were injured in clashes with soldiers.
   About 3,000 people, shouting ``Liberty!'' and slogans against
Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, converged in downtown
Port-au-Prince near the National Palace after attending a memorial
service on the outskirts of the capital for 11-year-old Roseline
Vaval, shot to death by the army Monday.
   About 10,000 people turned up for her burial Thursday in the
small town of Petit Goave.
   Along the road leading to Petit Goave, outside the town of
Carrefour, about 3,000 protesters burned automobiles, including a
police car, and erected barricades of flaming tires.
   The independent Radio Metropole said a soldier and a civilian
was killed in the Carrefour clashes. It said a mob carrying sticks
and stones dragged a passing soldier from his motorcycle and beat
him to death.
   The radio said the killing was in reprisal for the earlier
killing of a civilian by a presidential guardsman.
   Avril, who came to power in September 1988 in a coup led by
rank-and-file soldiers, has been under increasing pressure from
opposition groups to resign.
   ``The will of the people is for Avril to step down,'' said a
communique released Thursday night by a coalition of 11 opposition
parties which had called on Haitians to rise against Avril.
   Businesses closed and people poured into the streets pounding
pots and pans, garbage cans and metal poles after students called a
day of mourning for the girl, shot by a soldier breaking up an
anti-government demonstration.
   Maj. Gen. Serge Saint-Eloi, the inspector general of the army,
said Thursday night that a soldier from a passing vehicle shot the
girl but there would be no investigation because her parents buried
her before an autopsy could be conducted.
   A spokeswoman for the Haitian Christian Democratic Party,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said three soldiers barged into
the party headquarters near the National Palace on Thursday and
beat three party members with their rifle butts.
   President Bush remarked on the Haitian situation on Thursday
while attending a ceremony in Fort Myer, Va., marking the U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   Bush said, ``The revolution continues. The people have spoken in
Nicaragua. When they speak in Cuba and Haiti, our Western
Hemisphere will be entirely within the compass of freedom.''
   The opposition in Nicaragua, backed by the United States,
defeated President Daniel Ortega and his ruling Sandinistas in Feb.
25 elections.
   In Haiti's capital, protesters leaving the memorial in the slum
neighborhood of Bel Air left flaming tires at nearly every
crossroad along the 1{-mile route into the city.
   A crowd then made its way to a cemetery for her burial, and
soldiers used truncheons and fired into the air to disperse about
1,000 protesters. One unidentified man was killed a few feet from
the army headquarters.
   A doctor at the state hospital said 12 people were injured,
including two who suffered gunshot wounds.
   Reports surfaced of student-led demonstrations in several
provincial cities in the fourth day of protest against the
government. Schools were closed throughout the country.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported the Army High Command had ordered
soldiers to use restraint in quelling unrest.
   In an interview Wednesday, Avril indicated he would consider
resigning, saying, ``I will never resist the will of the people.''
But, he said, ``If I step down hurriedly, it will create a lot of
turmoil.''
   General elections are scheduled this year but virtually all
opposition parties have promised to boycott them unless Avril first
steps down. They say he is not to be trusted with holding free
elections or handing over power to civilians.
   The parties also want Avril to be replaced by a Supreme Court
justice until a new leader is elected.
   Avril has said he is not interested in running for office and
urged his opponents to put aside differences and get on with
elections.
   In protests reminiscent of the demonstrations in November 1985
to protest the army's killing of three high school students,
thousands of students have been marching since Monday in the
provincial towns of Jacmel, Jeremie, Leogane, Petit Goave and
Mirebalais.
   The 1985 student protests led to downfall of dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to exile in France in February 1986.
   Avril later ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who succeeded Duvalier.
   In November 1987, during the first free elections since Haiti
became independent from France in 1804, attackers protected by
soldiers killed at least 34 voters at the polls and the elections
were called off.

   Three Northwest Airlines pilots were arrested
on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol after they
landed a commercial flight from Fargo, N.D., here Thursday, airport
police said.
   The three arrested were the captain, first officer and second
officer in charge of Flight 650, which left Fargo at 6 a.m. and
arrived in the Twin Cities about 7 a.m., said police Lt. Dale
Gormanson at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Douglas Solseth, a safety inspector for the Federal Aviation
Administration, reported to police about 6:45 a.m. that he
suspected the flight crew piloting the flight from Fargo to
Minneapolis was under the influence of alcohol, Gormanson said.
   Airport police met Solseth at the gate where the plane arrived.
Solseth made citizens' arrests of the three pilots, Gormanson said.
   Solseth did not return phone calls for further comment.
   Airport police officers took custody of the three, who all
consented to provide blood samples, Gormanson said. The pilots were
released about 10:40 a.m. pending test results, he said.
   Alan Muncaster, vice president in charge of corporate
communications for the Minnesota-based Northwest, said the results
of the blood-alcohol tests won't be known for several days.
   ``Until we have those results, the pilots have been removed from
service,'' Muncaster said.
   Northwest officials did not know what caused authorities to
suspect the pilots may have been drinking, he said.
   ``We're trying to find out why they were arrested,'' Muncaster
said. He said he knew of nothing that occurred during the flight
that would have made authorities suspect the pilots were under the
influence of alcohol.
   ``Northwest is working with the FAA and the Metropolitan
Airports Commission to investigate this,'' Muncaster added.

   The Dade County School Board late Wednesday
selected Paul W. Bell, a 30-year veteran of the school system, as
the new superintendent of the district containing Miami.
   Bell, deputy superintendent for education for Dade County
schools since 1987, succeeds Joseph A. Fernandez, who left his
$155,000-a-year post to become chancellor of New York City public
schools.
   The Dade County system is the largest school district in Florida
with 282,000 students and 264 schools, and the fourth largest in
the nation after New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
   The board voted 4-3 to approve Bell for the job on the 17th
ballot, then chose to make the decision unanimous, said Dade County
schools spokesman Andy Gollan.
   The board, unable to reach a majority decision on a new
superintendent after 16 ballots, deferred the issue and took care
of other business until several hours later in the meeting, Gollan
said.
   A contract for Bell, 56, whose salary is subject to negotiation,
is expected to be submitted at the board's next meeting on March
21, Gollan said.
   Other contenders for the post included Dade County associate
superintendents James Fleming and Solomon Stinson; San Diego
superintendent Thomas Payzant and Indianapolis superintendent James
Adams.
   The board initially waffled on whether to conduct a nationwide
search or choose someone locally after Fernandez was picked for his
new job in September. But the panel spent the last four months
conducting a national search at a cost of $60,000.
   Tee S. Greer Jr., who did not actively pursue the
superintendency, served as acting superintendent after Fernandez
assumed his new position on Jan. 1, Gollan said.
   Bell joined the Dade County system in 1960 as a teacher. He has
a master's degree in education from the University of Louisville in
Kentucky, where he also received his bachelor's degree.

   Reporters and columnists withheld their bylines
from the pages of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Wednesday, one day
before contract negotiations were to resume between the newspaper
and its unions.
   About 600 members of Local 47 of the St. Louis Newspaper Guild
have been working without a contract since their old pact expired
at midnight Feb. 28.
   The guild is the largest of 11 unions at the newspaper and is
one of six unions that have not reached agreement on a new contract.
   Herb Goodrick, executive director of the local, said he was
pleased with the number of writers who had withheld their bylines
in the first ``byline strike'' in the paper's history.
   ``It's been very effective,'' said Goodrick. ``It's to show that
they're embarrassed to put their name on a paper that takes the
bargaining position that the Post has taken. They're ashamed of it
and don't want their name tied to it.''
   Post-Dispatch Publisher Nicholas Penniman said only that the
writers were within their rights to withhold their bylines under
their current contract.
   The labor dispute comes at a particularly sticky time for the
Post-Dispatch, which is no longer the only daily newspaper in town
thanks to last fall's startup of the non-union St. Louis Sun by
Ingersoll Publications Co. of Princeton, N.J.
   Post-Dispatch unions have urged a boycott of the Sun, which on
Tuesday denied admittance to Goodrick, an attorney and a reporter
from the St. Louis Labor Tribune.
   The Post-Dispatch is owned by Pulitzer Publishing Co.
   Management and the union are at odds over a number of issues,
including the deletion of a 4 percent cost-of-living increase that
was offered in a company proposal the union rejected last September.
   The latest company offer would also deny sick leave to employees
who contract illnesses through ``immorality.''
   Other unresolved issues include a lengthy managment rights
clause, maternity leave, union rights, employee drug testing and a
two-tier wage system which would pay new hires lower wages.
   Goodrick said the union has not threatened a strike against the
newspaper.
   ``At this point we've tried to be very restrained and
responsible,'' he said. ``Our objective is to get an agreement. A
strike is one of the tools for that, but we think there are other
steps we can take before that.
   ``I'd like to reach an agreement in the next couple of days,''
Goodrick said. ``But if we don't we can't just sit around twiddling
our thumbs. We have to do something to motivate people.''

   President Bush announced a national
transportation policy Thursday that would cost travelers more and
increase local governments' share in meeting air, land and sea
travel needs into the next century.
   Just as the Model T and the Wright brothers' plane ``prepared
the way for today's millions of cars and thousands of passenger
jets, so it is now our turn to invest in America's future,'' Bush
said in unveiling the policy with Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner.
   Bush said it would help keep America ``the world leader in
transportation.''
   The 129-page plan, ``Moving America Into The 21st Century,''
calls for more toll roads, local gas taxes, user fees, private
investments, competition, deregulaton, research into futuristic
systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as increased
attention to safety and protection of the environment.

   Researchers working with live human cells in
test tubes have developed a genetic ambush of the AIDS virus and
say the experimental technique could combat other types of viruses.
   Dr. John J. Rossi, a researcher at the Bechman Research
Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., said Thursday that
his laboratory has made a synthetic ribozyme that is able to
genetically cripple the AIDS virus and prevent it from reproducing
in test tube experiments.
   The ribozyme, said Rossie, ``is inside the cell and its waiting
there like a soldier waiting for the enemy to come.''
   Although the technique is promising, he said it is still far
from being available for treating patients.

   Regardless of which war it was or how many years
have passed, the grunts _ the infantrymen who've fought in a war _
don't readily talk about it with those who've never been in one.
   A common reason: only other grunts can possibly understand what
combat is like. It takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men
out, yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine
through repetition.
   But Bill Moyers somewhow accomplishes the former while largely
avoiding the latter in his ``From D-Day to the Rhine,'' an
old-soldier special, which the Public Broadcast Service is showing
Sunday.
   In it, Moyers, just a boy when World War II ended, takes a
memory-lane visit to the battlefields of France, Belgium and
Germany with a group of U.S. Army veterans who fought there in the
last two years of the war.
   Now gray-haired and in their 60s and 70s, most move slowly and
talk quietly, occasionally chuckling or grinning about the odd,
sometimes funny, little memories that any war produces.
   They recall the guy who spent a half-hour each day trimming his
mustache, the sound of gears cranking as a German tank's turret
turned to fire, and the Army pilot who showed up at the Normandy
beachhead not long after D-Day in June 1944. He stood out. He was
all dressed up, in his class-A uniform.
   It's a thoughtful, impressionistic show in which recollections
of war are illustrated with old newsreels of combat, or contrasted
with scenes of today, like French kids clambering over a Sherman
tank, now a museum piece.
   A rolling tour of the bloody past, the program always is headed
toward the Rhine, with occasional pauses for interviews in little
towns or gently rolling fields where men once killed each other and
where cows now peacefully graze.
   The veterans include a Medal of Honor winner from San Antonio,
Texas, Jose Lopez. Now 79, he won the nation's highest military
award when he was over 30, which is ancient for a combat
infantryman.
   But he'd lied back then and said he was two years younger. Why?
He wanted to be a paratrooper. Why? He shrugs. ``So we could meet
the enemy as soon as possible and get the thing over.''
   The vets inspect a museum and a graphic tapestry of a much
earlier war, the bloody battle of 1066 in which William the
Conquerer's troops went to war in Normandy.
   Moyers later asks one of the soldiers of World War II, a
battalion surgeon then, how the tapestry strikes him. The doctor
gently smiles.
   It makes him think, he says, about how endless war is, ``how
it's a part of everbody's life, war and death and men fighting
men.''
   There are the expected visits to U.S. military cemetaries _ but
also a stop at a neatly trimmed German military cemetery in France,
where the grave of one soldier who fought for Hitler is simply
marked ``Ein Deutscher Soldat.''
   At times, this 90-minute documentary, filmed and produced by
David Grubin, drags a bit. Several stories go on too long; they
could have been edited more tightly.
   It might have made a better show had Moyers brought in a few
German ex-grunts, heard their stories, gotten their perspective.
They visit the old battlefields, too.
   But ``From D-Day to the Rhine'' is a good effort, flaws and all.
And what strikes you most about it is how quietly humble and
plain-spoken most of its old soldiers are.
   Their manner, their lack of I-was-there bombast, may make a few
old-timers think of Ernie Pyle's musings on life after the war,
thoughts that the famed war correspondent wrote in France in August
1944.
   ``Submersion in war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the
master of the peace,'' he wrote. ``All we can do is fumble and try
once more _ try out of the memory of our anguish _ and be as
tolerant with each other as we can.''

   For years people have squirreled away
personal possessions in those impersonal rows of attached
garage-like structures thrown up alongside the nation's roads and
highways.
   ``We don't like to throw anything away,'' said Charles Floss, a
representative of the West Virginia-based Parkline Industries which
manufactures buildings used by self-storage facilities.
   ``We're all pack rats,'' Floss said.
   These days, self-storage operators are benefiting from a new
breed of pack rats _ businessmen. They're doing it by offering
computerized surveillance systems, climate-controlled units,
facsimile machines and even landscaping around what one industry
expert calls ``a bunch of garage doors.''
   ``In the past, security and lighting were not big issues and the
quality of management was not good,'' said Jim Chiswell, vice
president of the Sovran Group in Williamsville, N.Y., which manages
33 self-storage facilities nationwide.
   ``Now the focus is shifting to professional,'' Chiswell said.
``We're not just self-storage operators. We're storage
consultants.''
   Old-timers in the industry say self storage started about 40
years ago, but they don't agree on the exact location.
   ``It's believed the industry started in Texas. But there's
evidence of it in Florida and Utah in the 1950s,'' said Hardy Good,
publisher of Mini Storage Messenger, a trade magazine based in
Phoenix, Ariz.
   Self storage now is a $4 billion-a-year industry, with an
estimated 20,000 of the structures spread across the country, vs.
3,500 a decade ago. Some have even sprung up in Canada, Europe and
Australia.
   Some claim they've become such an integral part of American life
that you can watch the change in seasons by the comings and goings
at self-storage facilities.
   ``In the spring you see trailers pull up with snow blowers and
skis and out comes the back yard furniture,'' Chiswell said. ``In
New York City you can judge the change in seasons by women taking
out huge garment bags of clothes that they can't store in their
small apartments.''
   Self-storage operators say in the early years, most business
came from people storing household goods _ kitchen appliances,
sports equipment and assorted gadgets they never used, but couldn't
bear to throw away.
   As people moved into apartments, town houses and scaled-down
houses that lacked basements, garages and even attics, the
self-storage industry boomed.
   ``There's a primary need people have to store things,'' Floss
said. ``We don't like to throw anything away.''
   That's no longer the case, says John Logan, a sociology
professor at the State University of New York at Albany.
   ``People hanging on to things is what shows up more in people's
garages and attics. Keeping things for a long time for nothing more
than personal attachment is a luxury,'' Logan said.
   ``What you find in self-storage facilities is more basic things
people need to keep,'' he said. ``When people are actually paying
for space, they're more likely to keep only stuff they need.''
   This has resulted in an evolution of sorts for self-storage
operators, who say they're gradually making the transition toward
commercial storage.
   Self-storage facilities are more sophisticated than their
earlier counterparts, offering climate-controlled and built-to-suit
units, lighted units, pickup and delivery, and copying machines.
   Climate control is necessary for people wanting to store
computer equipment and business records and larger units can serve
as mini-warehouses, Floss said.
   Cheap space is another selling point. For example a 10 feet by
10 feet space goes for an average of about $80 a month, about a
third the price of comparable commercial space in many areas.
   Self-storage companies rent units ranging from the size of
closets to spaces large enough for a car, boat or a miniwarehouse.
The 10-by-10 space, the most popular size, is big enough to hold a
few rooms of efficiently stacked household furniture.
   Or 30,000 firecrackers. That's what federal agents seized
recently at a self-storage facility in Kent, Wash. Included in the
haul were 10,000 M-1000 firecrackers _ each nearly equal to a half
stick of dynamite.

   Chase Untermeyer says that being George Bush's
chief talent scout is ``rather like painting the Golden Gate
Bridge.''
   ``Once you finish the job, you have to start in at the other end
and start painting it again,'' says the 44-year-old White House
personnel director and Bush protege.
   From a crowded office in the West Wing of the White House,
Untermeyer and his staff assemble resumes and sort out the winners
from the also-rans in the quest for presidential appointments.
   With White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, the affable
Houston-raised and Harvard-trained Untermeyer makes the final
recommendations to Bush on 3,500 jobs. Untermayer and his staff
also ride herd on Cabinet and agency heads in filling more than
2,000 other political posts.
   Untermeyer, once a political reporter, said in a recent
interview that ``it's sort of a rule of thumb in this business
(that) every time you make an appointment you earn nine enemies and
one ingrate.''
   There also has been some criticism of the speed with which the
White House has filled appointments. Last September, Democrats on
Capitol Hill accused Bush of operating ``a Swiss-cheese
govermnent'' riddled with high-level vacancies.
   Untermeyer defends the administration's performance, saying that
background checks are time-consuming and that the criticism would
have been far worse ``if we had slam-dunked people into jobs.''
   ``I personally don't mind being the target of a bad news story
or two in 1989 if we are spared in 1990 and thereafter a series of
news stories about some cretin or boob or otherwise incompetent
individual who was named to office by George Bush,'' he told the
Heritage Foundation last year.
   ``You can bet that the folks writing those stories would not
say, `On the other hand, the White House in 1989 acted with
admirable speed in putting this fine citizen into office,''' said
Untermeyer.
   In the interview, Untermeyer said the opposition turned up the
heat on the pace of appointments ``essentially because we had
denied the Democrats ... the so-called sleaze issue.''
   ``Practically none of our nominees has come under any
controversy, whereas that happened all the time under President
Reagan.''
   However, several Bush nominees to major posts were defeated or
forced to withdraw, including John Tower as defense secretary and
William Lucas as the Justice Department's civil rights chief.
   In addition, Fred Bush, the chief fund-raiser for the 1988 Bush
campaign but no relation to the president, was rejected as
ambassador to Luxembourg after coming under scrutiny for contracts
he had received from Reagan's Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Untermeyer was executive assistant to then-Vice President Bush
during the first two years of the Reagan administration. He then
spent five years in the Pentagon as a deputy and then assistant
secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserves, responsible for
recruiting, training, health and other matters for the Navy's
600,000 sailors and 200,000 Marines.
   Untermeyer, who said he longs to leave personnel work and
``return to a policy rule,'' has stayed off the social circuit,
partly to avoid being button-holed by job seekers.
   He routinely logs 12- to 14-hour days, customarily getting by on
four or five hours of sleep a night.
   At his desk on a recent Sunday afternoon, Untermeyer
acknowledged that 1989 had ``its grim points, but it had its
upside, too. I also met the woman that I'm now engaged to marry.''
   He and Diana C. Kendrick, 27, executive assistant to C. Boyden
Gray, the White House counsel, plan an October wedding.
   ``It was a White House romance. You might say that we met on a
Sunday working on paperwork _ which is exactly what's happening
now.''

   The recognition comes in the wake of a meeting in Prague between
three Mormon leaders and Czech Deputy Prime Minister Josef Hromadka
last month.
   ``It means we're able to function fully as a church in that
nation,'' said church spokesman Jerry Cahill.
   He said the recognition actually is a ``restoration,'' since the
church had functioned in Czechoslovakia from 1929 to 1950.
   There currently are about 200 Mormons in the nation of 15.6
million. The church announced eight new missions, including three
in Eastern European countries, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Graham Holding East-West Berlin Rally To Boost Spiritual Morale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Billy Graham is holding a big, evangelistic rally in
Berlin this Saturday, intended as the first ecumenical gathering of
East and West Germans in more than 30 years.
   He says churches played a key role in overturning the autocratic
East German government last fall.
   ``This has given new hope to people,'' he said in an interview
before flying to Berlin this week. But the aftermath, he said,
seems to have left a ``spiritual vacuum.''
   ``There's a spiritual vacuum and spiritual hunger both in East
and West Germany,'' he said. ``People want something to believe
in.''
   Graham said that like many others, he had been astounded by the
rapid swing away from monolithic communism last year by East
European countries. ``I didn't think it would happen in my
lifetime,'' he said.
   ``It could bring about a long period of peace in the world,''
Graham said, ending the U.S. Soviet Soviet conflict and nuclear
``balance of terror'' that has endangered humanity for 45 years.
   ``We ought to go to SALT 10 and eliminate all these terrible
weapons of mass destruction, the chemical weapons and other weapons
now on the drawing board,'' he said. ``They're frightening.''
   Church leaders both in West Germany and long-communist met with
Graham in Berlin last month, urging the joint rally at a time when
``German Christians live between fear and hope.''
   Peaceful demonstrations by the East Germans last fall toppled
the prolonged rule of Communist boss Erick Honecker and installed a
mixed, interim government, pending March 18 elections.
   Prospects also are being dicussed for reunifying the nation,
divided between East and West since World War II.
   Church leaders on both sides said in a statement issued by
Graham's office that ``in the last decades Billy Graham has built
bridges of understanding between East and West by encouraging many
people to come to a living faith.''
   The rally, which many thousands from both sides of the border
are expected to attend, is to be Saturday afternoon at the plaza in
front of the Reichstag building next to the Brandenburg Gate.
   ``I'm a little bit afraid _ I don't want to be political and
must not say one word with the slightest hint of politics,'' Graham
said. ``I'll just preach the gospel and tell of Christian values
and morals.''
   Graham, 72, has previously preached both in East and West German
cities, as well as in all the other Eastern bloc countries except
Bulgaria and Albania.
   He met with German pastors in Berlin last December, on his way
back from a visit with Pope John Paul II, and said the Germans felt
people there needed an interpretation of recent events ``from a
Christian point of view.''
   ``They said they wanted a religious figure, someone well-known
and accepted on both sides, to provide some Christain word on what
has happened,'' Graham said. ``I told them I just didn't have the
strength to to do all that. I was determined to say no, but after
listening to the East Berliners tell me why I had to come, I had to
give in, after all they've been through.''
   Graham said the East German churches played a major part in the
governmental turn-about there.
   ``People didn't feel free to meet, except in the churches,'' he
said. ``That's where they met and began their marches.''
   However, he said, after the Berlin Wall came down last Nov. 9, a
sort of lethargy has come over the churches.
   ``They tell me people now are deserting the churches,'' he said.
``This is particularly a spiritual problem.''
   In the political transition going on in Eastern Europe, he said,
``Religion is basic to freedom. Man is first of all a worshipping
creature. He has to have something to believe in, a basis for
life.''
   Graham said that in his numerous meetings with Soviet leaders in
the past, he had insisted that ``propagandizing atheism wouldn't
work. It goes against human nature. People want the freedom to
believe in God, to worship God.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two years after Covenant House started
sheltering children from the streets, the nation's largest program
for young runaways is struggling with another troubled life: its
own.
   Torn by allegations of sexual impropriety that forced the
resignation of its charismatic founder, the $87 million-a-year
operation has postponed some expansion plans and steeled itself for
a drop in donations.
   The scrutiny also has revealed criticism from a new source:
social welfare professionals who question its style of service.
   Critics agree Covenant House helps fill the urgent need of
sheltering homeless youths; each night, about 2,000 runaways sleep
in its centers in six U.S. cities, Latin America and Canada.
   But some say Covenant House's main thrust _ short-term stays in
institutional settings _ represents triage rather than treatment.
Others complain that its Roman Catholic philosophy precludes sex
education that could help stem the spread of AIDS.
   Some critics accuse its counselors of harassing homosexual
youths, and others charge the organization with institutional
arrogance, saying it virtually ignores other privately operated
programs.
   ``They fill the hallways and then call the press in and say,
`There's kids on the floor, we need more money,''' said Marion
Reidel, clinical director at the Emergency Shelter, a much smaller
program for runaways in New York. ``They're notorious for not
networking with the other programs in town.''
   Since December, a series of former clients has stepped forward
to accuse Covenant House's 62-year-old founder, the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, of sexual misconduct.
   One youth claimed to have received money and gifts from Ritter,
and Covenant House has conceded trying to start him off in a new
life by giving him the identity of a dead 10-year-old boy, without
asking the dead boy's parents. Ritter has denied wrongdoing, but
Franciscan officials ordered him to take a leave of absence while
they investigated. On Feb. 27, he resigned. The next day,
prosecutors said they had found ``questionable financial
transactions'' at Covenant House, but none meriting prosecution.
   Covenant House gets 95 percent of its funds from private
donations, relying on appeals written by Ritter and mailed monthly
to 800,000 past or potential supporters.
   Donations fell, recovered and fell again as the allegations
surfaced and subsided. Now Covenant House officials are uncertain _
and deeply worried _ about the effect of Ritter's departure.
   ``There's a real question as to whether Covenant House will be
able to grow and expand as it has, or whether Covenant House will
be put into a period of retrenchment for some time,'' said Frank
Macchiarola, who served briefly as acting president before
resigning, also on Feb. 27, because of friction with the
organization's board.
   Covenant House operates large shelters in New York; New Orleans;
Houston; Los Angeles; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Anchorage, Alaska; and
Toronto, and orphanage-style shelters in Mexico, Honduras,
Guatemala and Panama.
   Plans to establish a shelter in Washington are on hold, but
expansions in Los Angeles and New Orleans are proceeding and a
counseling center in Dallas just opened.
   Despite the organization's longstanding practice of spending
almost all of each year's income, Covenant House officials said its
finances are basically sound and no cutbacks are envisioned.
   But the criticism of its programs appears likely to continue.
   ``We have this kind of mixed feeling toward the Covenant
House,'' said Fred Griesbach, head of the Coalition for the
Homeless.
   While the rate of AIDS is ``astronomical'' among runaways,
Greisbach said, Covenant House does not encourage using condoms to
stem the disease's spread but instead counsels abstinence.
   ``They're not going to deal with it in what I think is a
rational way,'' he said. ``We think it's counterproductive. You
need to talk about condoms, about abortion, about birth control
that goes beyond abstinence.''
   Macchiarola said Covenant House's handling of birth control and
sex education is guided by principle. ``The policy we follow is
church policy,'' he said. ``We have to proceed off what we think is
right.''
   Covenant House's main purpose is to provide emergency shelter
for a few days or weeks to runaways who often return to the street.
But critics say smaller, more intensive programs have more success
helping youngsters find a new life.
   ``Young people are supposed to be in a family-type
environment,'' Reidel said. ``They're not supposed to be
institutionalized. They don't belong in large buildings.''
   Covenant House's Manhattan shelter, in tawdry Times Square,
fails to remove youngsters from the dangers and temptations of
street life and is too big for effective individual counseling, she
said.
   The Manhattan shelter was designed for 250 youths but often
sleeps more than 300, some on roll-out pads in lounges. Macchiarola
said Covenant House's reluctance to refer youths elsewhere reflects
its open-door policy.
   ``The moment our people think they should refer kids elsewhere
is the moment we've taken a different attitude,'' he said.
   After a brief stay, two-thirds of the shelter's visitors return
to the street, where some meet an early death from drugs, disease
or violence. The others return to families, find their own place to
live or enter long-term residential programs.
   Covenant House also operates a 150-bed long-term residence in
New York, and other organizations run similar, smaller programs.
   ``And there are advantages to that smallness,'' said Susan
Mullgrav, special projects director at the city Department of Youth
Services. ``It's more personalized. It's more individualized.''
   Yet given the scope of the problem _ with an estimated 100,000
to 300,000 homeless runaway youths nationwide _ Mullgrav and thers
concede large shelters do fill the most urgent needs: A bed, a meal
and someone to talk to.
   ``Covenant House has been necessary, in spite of their
programmatic problems, because they're one of the few agencies that
has that number of beds,'' said Reidel. ``It is better than
sleeping on the streets.''

himself to a hunter with a single bullet left and a hungry tiger
coming at him.
   The tiger is inflation and Collar says he has to kill it with
one quick shot or be devoured.
   ``But don't worry,'' he adds confidently. ``I'm an excellent
shot, and I won't miss.''
   Inflation rose 56 percent in January and a record 73 percent in
February, with the projection of an annual rate of 71,000 percent.
March is expected to be worse.
   Collor will replace President Jose Sarney, who took over from a
military government in 1985 but failed in a number of attempts to
halt the nation's economic and financial slide.
   Brazilians have lived for decades with inflation but have been
protected by cost-of-living indexing of wages and bank accounts.
Experts now say, however, such government protection may be at an
end.
   ``Hyperinflation marks the demise of this socially exclusive,
elitist economic model. It is the state of bankruptcy of the
government,'' Edmar Bacha, an economist and former head of the
government's census bureau, said in an interview.
   Today, Bacha added, this country of 150 million is what he calls
a ``Belindia'' _ a Belgium and an India side by side.
   The Belgium half resembles a developed country, with the Western
world's eighth-largest economy and third-biggest trade surplus, a
world leader in the production of coffee, sugar, orange juice,
soybeans, cotton, and iron ore; a producer and exporter of
sophisticated goods such as computers, cars, aircraft and rockets.
   The India part is marked by the Third World's largest foreign
debt, put at $114 billion, 7 million street children, 20 percent
adult illiteracy, sprawling shantytowns and epidemics of dengue,
malaria and yellow fever.
   However, the consensus is that inflation is the country's most
serious problem.
   ``Collor's credibility and the viability of his government
depend on how he deals with inflation,'' said Luiz Antonio de
Medeiros, president of the powerful metalworkers union. ``All the
other problems he will face _ income distribution, the foreign
debt, poverty, etcetera _ are secondary.''
   The economy has gone haywire at the hands of inflation.
   In a Rio department store, a Barbie doll costs more than
February's monthly minimum wage of 2,004 cruzados ($70). A linen
shirt costs as much as six 3-speed blenders. Identical knapsacks
cost 600 cruzados ($21.50) at one store and 2,400 cruzados ($86) at
another in the same shopping mall.
   Investors seek shelter in gold and illegal black-market dollars
or in an extremely short-term financial market known as the
``overnight,'' which today pays 105 percent a month.
   Consumers rush to stock up on food, clothes and electrical
appliances before prices go up again.
   Violent crime is increasing, and Brazilians look anxiously to
neighboring Argentina, where runaway inflation has led to the
looting of supermarkets and military unrest, as a example of what
might be in store for them.
   ``People are frightened,'' said Graciela Treiyer, the manager of
an upscale leather goods boutique in Rio de Janeiro. ``The
government says inflation is 70 percent, but we know it's more.
Things are just out of control.''
   An estimated $1 billion a month is leaving the country, and
much-needed foreign investment has dried up.
   ``One can't plan, one can't contract, one doesn't know how much
supplies are going to cost or anything else with inflation so
ridiculously high,'' said William Meissner, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro.
   A growing number of Brazilians are seeking financial safety in
the United States, Western Europe or Japan.
   ``We are not an island of prosperity. With hyperinflation, we
are more like a continent of despair,'' said Sen. Roberto Campos, a
former planning minister and ex-ambassador to the United States and
England.
   Some even are asking whether Brazil was better off under the
repressive military regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985.
   ``Sure we've got democracy now, but what good is it when beans
are 38 cruzados ($1.37) a kilo?'' said Jose de Oliveira, a tax
office worker who moonlights as a chauffeur at a car rental agency.
   Collor's remedy is to drastically cut government spending. He
has promised to lay off workers, close government ministries, drop
subsidies and sell off state-owned companies. Trade barriers will
be lowered and protection for domestic industry eliminated.
   However, economists say Brazil also will have to sharply reduce
interest payments on its billion-dollar foreign debt, which amount
to $12 billion a year.
   Collor says he will order the federal police to arrest the ``tax
evaders, middlemen, and speculators'' he holds responsible for
inflation.
   ``The blame falls on the elite ... who take advantage of the
economic and financial disorder to make more and more money, in
detriment of the vast majority of the population,'' he told a
recent news conference.
   Collor is banking on his popularity among the poor masses and
his credibility as a popularly elected president. (Sarney was
chosen by an electoral college.) In December, Collor defeated
socialist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva by 4 million votes in Brazil's
first free presidential election since 1960.
   However, analysts say Collor will meet stiff opposition from
Congress, labor unions and the rich who risk losing long-held
privileges.
   ``The elite will use the unions,'' economist Bacha predicts.
``Inefficient and protected industries will claim they'll be forced
to fire employees if the government allows imports. It's the same
argument Americans are used to hearing in relation to Japanese
competition.''
   Congress is another stumbling block. Collor's National
Reconstruction Party, founded just last year, has only 26 seats in
the 570-seat legislature. Da Silva, his adversary in the election,
has pledged to form a ``parallel government'' with other leftists
to oppose the new administration.
   Militant labor unions, which backed da Silva, have threatened to
strike if the government holds down wages or lays off workers.
   ``Collor doesn't have support in the organized sectors of
society,'' said Eli Diniz, a political scientist at the University
Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro. ``He will have to negotiate a
social pact to give his measures legitimacy or try a populist
mobilization.''
   Brazilians, who have seen four anti-inflation plans collapse in
as many years under Sarney, are torn between hope and skepticism.
   ``The people are rooting for Collor and want to help, but they
will demand results,'' said psychologist Sigrid Marques da Silva
Castro.
   In a February survey by the respected IBOPE polling institute,
68 percent of those questioned said they had faith in Collor.
   ``I hate to say it, but I'm optimistic like a Brazilian is
optimistic,'' said Meissner of the American Chamber of Commerce.
``Brazil's like a baby with a fever. You're convinced the baby is
going to die, and two hours later it's playing outside.''

   Sitting cross-legged on the gymnasium
floor in a rare moment of quiet, 3-year-old Steven Wallenda II
scribbles on a pad of paper. He scrawls two overlapping circles and
a long tail, like a drumstick.
   ``This is my mommy's lung transfer,'' he says matter-of-factly,
tapping the the circles. ``And this is her fake leg,'' he adds,
outlining the tail.
   Running the pen from the circles to the tail's end, he says,
``When you have cancer, it goes real deep. All the way down to your
foot.''
   Sixteen feet above, deftly maneuvering a half-inch steel cable,
his mother, 21-year-old aerialist Angel Wallenda, is oblivious to
the worldly explanation of her illness.
   She and her husband, Steven, 34, gently traverse the wire,
testing its spring and memorizing the tricky parts in anticipation
of the evening's event: the final performance of the Wallendas as a
family, and Angel's last chance to work on a high wire.
   Her husband, the last of the clan still performing the feats
that made the Wallenda family famous, set up the recent benefit at
Mansfield University to help defray the costs of his wife's ongoing
battle with cancer. The cancer, a particularly belligerent breed,
forced the removal of her right leg below the knee in 1987, then
parts of both lungs in 1988.
   But it wasn't long before Angel was back on the wire,
miraculously inching her way along on one good leg and a lifelike
prosthesis.
   ``It's sort of scary,'' she explained with complete calm. ``You
can't feel the wire, so you have to just guess, really. But it's an
educated guess.''
   Doctors at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., plan
to operate Thursday to remove the cancer that has reappeared on
Angel's lungs.
   Putting on a good show for the crowd of 2,000 packing the
Mansfield gym gave Angel as much a psychological boost as a
financial one _ perhaps more.
   Her grin was constant as she greeted friends, handed out
autographs to a seemingly endless line of fans or hoisted her
rambunctious son for a moment of parental discipline.
   ``You can't look too far ahead or you'll get all out of
yourself,'' her husband explained after the show. ``I'm just
enjoying life today _ that's life, you know?
   ``That's life,'' he said, glancing at his wife.

<HEAD>Cost of Pictures Means Little to Academy Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's proof that Academy voters pay little
heed to what a movie costs: One of the contenders for best picture
was produced for $3 million, another for $8 million.
   Contrast those figures with the $50 million spent on ``Batman,''
which earned one Academy Award nomination _ for art direction.
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has a history of
ignoring the cost factor in rewarding the best achievements of the
film world. ``Marty,'' with a budget of $343,000, won as best
picture of 1955, beating such big-budget films as ``Picnic,''
``Mister Roberts'' and ``Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.''
   The $1-million ``Rocky'' knocked out its rivals in 1976. Other
low-budget winners: ``Chariots of Fire,'' 1981, and ``Platoon,''
1986.
   Oscar loves the Cinderella story, and this year it stars the
Irish-made drama ``My Left Foot.''
   ``We managed to get the picture made out of blind ignorance,''
admits producer Noel Pearson. ``We were two weeks into filming when
we lined up the financing.'' He had been a close friend of the
film's subject, hard-drinking Christy Brown, who became an
acclaimed artist and writer in spite of the cerebral palsy that
virtually immobilized him.
   Pearson started the film with his own money, plus 100,000 pounds
sterling apiece from a friend and from Irish television. Everyone
concerned with the film, including star Daniel Day-Lewis, worked
for bare minimum. An art gallery scene was filmed in Pearson's own
house. He borrowed costumes from his theatrical company.
   ``The film was made for just under $3 million, depending on the
rate of exchange,'' said the producer. ``We managed to do that
because everybody was committed. It was triumph of spirit over
financing.'' The latest estimate for the worldwide gross of ``My
Left Foot'' _ $50 million.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' also demonstrates that a film's budget is
immaterial at awards time. It was budgeted at $8 million, amazing
in view of the $20 million average for mainstream Hollywood films.
   How could Richard and Lili Zanuck produce such an inexpensive
film? It is basically a two-character story and the two stars,
Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, are not high-priced. Dan Aykroyd
is, but he took a lesser salary to play the straight role of the
old woman's son. His change of character paid off with a nomination
for supporting actor.
   Australian Bruce Beresford directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' on
locations in and around Atlanta and the Zanucks tightly budgeted
the locations. The film, about the long relationship between a
cranky widow and her patient chauffeur, has proved a huge hit, both
in awards (nine Oscar nominations, the most this year), and at the
box office ($60.3 million after 12 weeks in release).
   Two other nominees for best picture had average budgets and drew
mixed reviews, but their off-beat subjects somehow connected with
the moviegoing public.
   ``Field of Dreams'' invited audiences to swallow a whopper: that
an Iowa farmer would build a baseball diamond in his cornfield
where long-dead major leaguers would play.
   Many critics spurned the fantasy, but ticket buyers were
attracted by its message of hope and the star power of Kevin
Costner. Filmed for a reported $16 million, ``Field of Dreams''
amassed a gross of $63 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' looked like an impossible sell. The title
seemed a turnoff. Although Robin Williams was a hot draw in the
wake of ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' he played a relatively brief
role as the English teacher who inspires students at a 1960s boys
school to think creatively. Most of the screen time in the $20
million film was devoted to the cast of unknown teen-agers.
   Reviewers objected to Williams as a latter-day Mr. Chips and
found the tragic ending out of keeping with the rest of the film.
But ``Dead Poets Society,'' directed by another Australian, Peter
Weir, sold $94 million in theater tickets.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' proved that film audiences are
still concerned with the consequences of the Vietnam war. The film
was the result of a long collaboration between Oliver Stone, whose
``Platoon'' was drawn from his own experiences in the war, and Ron
Kovic, wounded veteran and anti-war activist. Tom Cruise, one of
today's biggest draws in films, and strong reviews helped
contribute to the success of ``Born on the Fourth of July'' _ $59.7
million in 10 weeks.
   Stone directed the film in the Philippines, which doubled for
both Vietnam and Mexico, and Dallas, which represented Kovic's home
town of Massapequa, N.Y. Despite the complex production, which
ranged from battlefields to national political conventions with
12,000 extras, the cost was reportedly $18 million.

<HEAD>Actress Competition: From Cantankerous Dowager to Smoldering
Chanteuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a half-century gap in age between
Jessica Tandy and Michelle Pfeiffer, who find themselves in
reluctant competition for Hollywood's highest prize, the Academy
Award.
   Their roles could scarcely be more different: Tandy as the
cantankerous Southern dowager in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Pfeiffer
as the smoldering chanteuse in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' They
are generally considered the front-runners in the race for best
actress.
   ``But I wish (the Academy Awards) ended with the nominations
instead of making us adversaries,'' observes Tandy. ``When they
pick the nominations, they pick the best of the crop. It's a pity
they have to single them out as one winner and four losers.''
   Also considered ``the best of the crop'' are Pauline Collins,
the wry, rebellious housewife of ``Shirley Valentine''; Jessica
Lange, the lawyer defending her father in ``Music Box,'' and
Isabelle Adjani, Rodin's tragic model in ``Camille Claudel.''
   Only Lange is a previous Oscar winner. She was chosen best
supporting actress of 1982 for ``Tootsie.''
   For Tandy, 80, an Academy Award would add to the many honors she
has achieved since her Broadway debut in 1930. She has won three
Tonys _ for ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' (as the original Blanche
DuBois), ``The Gin Game'' and ``Foxfire,'' the latter two with
husband Hume Cronyn. The TV version of ``Foxfire'' brought her an
Emmy.
   The London-born actress had no qualms about undertaking the part
of Miss Daisy: ``I like big roles. I like to be there all the
time.''
   At 31, Michelle Pfeiffer is cresting a career that might have
been relegated to sexpot parts, such as her early carhop in
``Hollywood Knights.'' She proved herself as an actress in
``Scarface,'' ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Married to the Mob''
and ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' for which she won a supporting actress
nomination last year.
   ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' was only a middling success, but
Pfeiffer proved a striking presence from the moment she auditioned
for lounge pianists Beau and Jeff Bridges with ``More Than You
Know.''
   Concerning her newfound success, the actress told an interviewer
she knew it wouldn't last and she would again be offered boring
parts. ``I've had enough of those to know that I never want to do
it again. I mean, I'd rather go back to checking groceries.''
   Collins had the advantage of playing her nominated role scores
of time in the London and New York theater, though in a different
form. ``Shirley Valentine'' as a play was a one-woman show. She won
the Tony for her bravura performance.
   Born near Liverpool, Collins spent most of her career in the
English theater and television. Americans know her as the
downstairs maid in ``Upstairs, Downstairs.''
   The film ``Shirley Valentine'' required her to swim nude in the
Aegean with Tom Conti. No problem. ``It's not a big deal in Europe,
nudity,'' said the actress, 49. ``My only qualms were that I wished
I was younger and thinner. But I ain't.''
   Lange applied her usual thoroughness as the Chicago lawyer in
``Music Box,'' studying court cases and reading briefs.
``Ultimately you can observe behavior, but when you get down to
playing the role, it all has to come from the character,'' she
observed.
   The actress has a reputation for willfulness on movie sets, but
for ``Music Box'' she relied entirely on the director, Costa-Gavras.
   ``I had such respect and confidence in Costa that I didn't feel
the need to get in there and make my opinions known,'' she said.
   Except for ``Driver,'' ``Quartet'' and the infamous ``Ishtar,''
Adjani has appeared exclusively in European films, and with great
distinction. Her performance in Francois Truffaut's ``The Story of
Adele H.'' brought her first Academy nomination for best actress in
1975. She has appeared in classics in the French theater as well as
such films as ``Nosferatu: Le Vampire,'' ``Possession'' and
``Antoinetta.''
   Though most filmgoers consider her French, Adjani was born in
Bavaria in 1955, the daughter of a Turkish-Algerian father and a
German mother. She spoke German until moving to Paris for her
school years.

   It's not often that someone tampers with a winner, especially a
winner backed by numbers.
   But the folks at Chevrolet, while seeing their 2-door S-10
Blazer chalk up record sales years in 1988 and 1989, had their eyes
on other numbers, too: numbers that showed baby boomers reaching
their 40s and 50s this decade, becoming the country's most affluent
chunk of people and, most importantly, buying 4-door sport utility
vehicles.
   Thus was born the 1991 Chevrolet S-10 4-Door Blazer, joining
Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee, the Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota 4Runner,
Nissan Pathfinder and Isuzu Trooper in the fast-growing 4-door
sport utility field. Another sport utility, the Ford Explorer, is
due out this year.
   The test S-10 4-Door Blazer readily showed why it's a worthy
competitor.
   The Blazer was spunky, with its 4.3-liter, fuel-injected V-6
mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. Even in tough, off-road
conditions in 4-wheel-drive, the Blazer was powerful, developing up
to 160 horsepower. I was impressed by its good traction _ mud,
gravel and water flew as the big Uniroyal steel-belted radials bit
into the earth, yet I felt perfectly at home, with no worries.
   Anti-lock brakes at all four wheels, a standard feature, made
for solid stops, and visibility was tops, thanks to the vehicle's
tall profile.
   The dashboard was especially high-tech for a truck. It was
digital, with sloping bits of bright blue indicating the oil
pressure and remaining fuel.
   Another nice feature was the styling of the rear seat-belt
connectors. They were located in recessed, cut-out areas in the
bench seat, which means a person can slide across easily _ no ouch
from hitting stiff, protruding seat belt holders.
   The armrest between the front bucket seats was deep, offering
substantial storage room. Up further, nearly under the dash, was
the gearbox for switching from 2-wheel-drive to 4-wheel-drive.
   This shift-on-the-fly feature was easy, and an adjacent diagram
of the Blazer's innards confirmed you had moved into 4-wheel-drive
when the diagram's front two wheels lit up in bright orange. The
gear shifter for the automatic transmission is located on the
steering column.
   As in most sport utilities, there was considerable road noise,
and there was a low rumble when the vehicle was in 4-wheel-drive. I
also felt some jiggles while riding, and because the vehicle had a
higher center of gravity than a car, it had some body roll and sway.
   The 4-Door Blazer is 6{ inches longer than its 2-door sibling
and offers 25 percent more cargo space. A longer wheelbase adds 15
more inches of rear seat hip room, too, making the rear seat quite
comfortable for even three adults.
   Chevrolet looks to produce up to 108,000 of the 4-Door Blazers
in 1990; total Blazer production is 180,000, spokeswoman Mary
McElyea said. Sales of the vehicles began in mid-January.
   Recent buyers of 2-door Blazers have had a median age of 38 and
annual household income of $50,000, she said. Most had white-collar
jobs, with 39 percent being college graduates.
   Seventy-three percent were men, and most were married. For
one-third of the buyers, the Blazer was their first purchase of a
new vehicle, she said.
   The 1991 S-10 4-Door Blazer is base priced at $16,905. That
compares with the Jeep Cherokee 4-Door with six-cylinder engine and
automatic transmission at $16,405, the Isuzu Trooper with V-6
engine and automatic transmission at $14,849, the 4-door Mitsubishi
Montero with V-6 and automatic transmission at about $16,400, and
$15,500 for a Toyota 4Runner with V-6 and automatic transmission.
   Consumer Reports magazine said 1983-88 model S-10 Blazers with
two doors and V-6 engines ranged between average and much worse
than average in reports of owner trouble. A Chevrolet spokesman
responded that the plants producing Blazers are among the highest
quality plants in the company.

   Mae Timbimboo Parry will never forget
nights as a child at her grandfather's feet. While winter winds
moaned outside, she listened in horrified fascination as he spoke
of the Bear River Massacre.
   Six decades later, Parry, the 70-year-old tribal secretary to
the Northwestern Shoshone, traces her life-long mission to reveal
the truth about the Army's slaughter of as many as 400 Indians in
1863 to the hours spent listening to Yeager Timbimboo, one of the
few survivors.
   ``He was the best story teller. He believed in passing his
stories on to his grandchildren, and he expected them to memorize
all of them. He'd tell them over and over and over again,'' Parry
said.
   ``We sat on the floor and grandpa sat on the chair. Every few
minutes he would ask, `Are you awake? Are you awake?''' she
recalled.
   ``And we would say yes. If one of us fell asleep, grandpa would
just get up and leave. So we stayed awake. He wanted us to know who
we were and where we came from.''
   Yeager, 12 when the soldiers attacked, survived and lay still in
the blood-spattered snow until a soldier realized he was alive. The
soldier let him live.
   ``He must have been spared for this purpose. If my grandfather
had died, it (the truth) may have been lost,'' said Parry, who has
passed Yeager's stories on to her five children and more than a
dozen grandchildren.
   The account of the attack by the man who launched it, Col.
Patrick Connor, was one of pitched battle and classic military
envelopment against well-armed and entrenched warriors, a view
reflected _ to the abiding anger of the Northwestern Shoshone _ on
a historical marker commemorating the ``Battle of Bear River.''
   In the years after she first heard the Bear River stories, Parry
became a repository for the tribe's oral history on the massacre.
Eventually, she blended her grandfather's stories with others in
what is considered by historians to be an authoritative 1976
monograph on file at the Utah State Historial Society in Salt Lake
City.
   Parry acknowledges that her life's quest stems not only from the
impact of her grandfather's stories, but also from the debt she
feels to the hundreds of kinfolk in unmarked graves.
   On countless trips to the massacre site as a child and later an
adult, she said, she felt an unseen presence.
   ``There have been many times as a family we have gone up there
and walked,'' Parry said. ``We would talk about what happened.
`This was where the soldiers came from; this is where somebody swam
the river; this is where the lady dropped into the water and her
baby drowned.'
   ``You really get a feeling that you're among them, and they are
with you,'' she said. ``You just feel you are not alone.''

<HEAD>Five Years of Gorbachev Lead to Freedoms But Food Shortages</HEAD>

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised the people a better
deal and has brought them far greater freedom during five years in
power, but the shortages and discomforts that make daily life a
struggle have grown worse.
   ``The main thing is to make life better for people,'' he told a
Western interviewer a few months after becoming Communist Party
chief in March 1985. ``There is no goal more important to us.''
   Five years later, the Soviet Union and its former Eastern
European satellites enjoy a stunning degree of democracy.
   President Gorbachev has eased the fear of war. He has freed
political prisoners from jails and psychiatric hospitals.
   Little remains of communism in the Communist Party's new program
except the spirit and methodology.
   The party no longer enjoys unquestioned authority, but
Gorbachev, a master of the apparatus through which he rose, is on
the verge of gaining broad new powers in a strengthened presidency.
   In the matters of personal comfort most important to the average
citizen, however, Gorbachev has not delivered.
   Food, housing and consumer goods are in even shorter supply than
when he took command of the Kremlin. Nearly half the people
questioned in a poll published this month said daily existence was
harder than in 1985.
   ``Five years later, the drudgery of renewal continues and isn't
yet close to its objectives,'' the pro-reform Moscow News commented.
   Gorbachev's economic program has been a series of mistakes and
half-measures. He has delayed painful but critically needed steps
like reform of a price structure that has no relation to costs and
wastes resources.
   Only in recent weeks have legislators approved laws allowing
farmers to lease land and individuals to own factories and other
means of production. Even ardent supporters of those laws say they
do not go far enough.
   Meat, butter and other foods are rationed in many places. In
Moscow, a city of 9 million people, 1.25 million are on waiting
lists for better apartments.
   Jewels of imperial architecture are crumbling. Repairmen and
snowplows seem to have vanished.
   The leader knows it. In a speech to the Communist Party Central
Committee last month, Gorbachev acknowledged ``further disruptions
of the consumer market, a growth in shortages and lines, and a fall
in the purchasing power of the ruble.''
   ``We hoped to mount the peak of the crisis in 1989, but recent
events have shown ... no change for the better,'' he said.
   On March 11, 1985, when Gorbachev followed the old, ailing
leadership that had presided for two decades, there was much that
needed fixing.
   His predecessors left a nation near bankruptcy, its
infrastructure worn out and people dispirited. It had plenty of
missiles, but no hot water in two-thirds of the rural hospitals.
   In the repressive Soviet Union of 1985, however, few dared
openly say anything was wrong.
   Gorbachev changed that. Under the banner of glasnost, or
openness, he has introduced greater official honesty and an
improved intellectual life.
   Last year, he installed the beginnings of democracy with the
first competitive elections and first working parliament in 70
years. In February, he won agreement from the Communist Party
leadership for a multiparty system.
   Newspapers and television, which once provided endless paeans to
the sacrifices of World War II soldiers and hero laborers, have
been transformed.
   The Iron Curtain has disintegrated. Once forbidden books have
been published, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag
Archipelago.''
   In 1990, it is expected that 8 million Soviet citizens will
visit the outside world, where Gorbachev has had his greatest
success and may be more popular than at home.
   Reformers across Eastern Europe attributed their courage to act,
and their success, to the Soviet leader's promise of
non-interference and his indications that the time for change had
arrived.
   By setting the satellites free and agreeing with the United
States to eliminate medium-range missiles, he helped lessen the
danger of war. NATO has reduced border patrols, recognizing the
diminishing risk of an attack by the Warsaw Pact.
   On the horizon are treaties on reducing long-range nuclear
weapons by 50 percent and withdrawing hundreds of thousands of U.S.
and Soviet soldiers from Central Europe.
   Even Soviet leaders more conservative than Gorbachev regard such
achievements with pride.
   ``We have lifted the real threat of nuclear war,'' said Yegor K.
Ligachev, the leading conservative in the Politburo, when asked by
reporters March 4 to name the successes of Gorbachev's five years.
   ``We were on the brink,'' he said. ``One step more and we could
have found ourselves in a nuclear catastrophe.''
   Regional and ethnic tensions are another matter. Ethnic
conflicts have taken 500 lives in two years and nationalism arising
from the new political freedom threatens to dismember the Soviet
Union.
   Lithuanians talk of declaring independence this year, perhaps as
early as this month.
   Activist Kazimieras Uoka told the Lithuanian Review the Soviet
Union was so sick that, ``by summer, the situation in Russia will
be such that our secession will be hardly noticeable.''
   Gorbachev responded to the threat of anarchy by seeking strong
new presidential powers, including the right to declare war and
suspend legislatures in the 15 republics.
   After local and regional elections March 4, he told reporters
the new powers were necessary because ``stability and order'' were
breaking down. He said disintegration of the Soviet Union would be
a greater upheaval than China's Cultural Revolution of a generation
ago.
   Parliament member Yuri Afanasiev, who is forming a more radical
reformist opposition to Gorbachev, said the Soviet leader's problem
is a shortage of public trust, not of power.
   ``Nobody listens,'' Afanasiev said in a television interview. He
said Gorbachev talks about the need to transform a centralized
empire into a voluntary union of independent nations, but has not
acted on it.
   Misgivings are increased by the fact that Gorbachev has promised
legal guarantees of human rights, limits on Communist Party power
and fully competitive democracy for nearly two years, but has not
translated the pledges into law.
   Many citizens were shocked by his televised, finger-wagging
tirade against radical reformers who denounced his proposed
stronger presidency as dangerously close to dictatorship.
   Whatever his powers, the hardest part of Gorbachev's job lies
ahead.
   Coal miners frustrated by miserable living conditions are
talking of renewing their strike when the weather warms.
   Hoarding increases. Citizens fear civil violence and ethnic
attack.
   ``People are tired,'' Gorbachev told reporters on election day.
   ``People can see how difficult it is to get the good things of
life, and how much more difficult it is under confrontation and the
arms race. Problems of housing, health care and the environment
need to be solved.''

   Here is a review of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's record
since becoming Soviet leader on March 11, 1985:
   FOREIGN POLICY
   _ Declared policy of non-intervention in Eastern Europe,
permitting a wave of revolutions that deposed old-style Communist
regimes, broke down the Berlin Wall and set the stage for German
reunification.
   _ Dramatically reduced fears of a nuclear war or Soviet attacks
on Western Europe or China.
   _ Cut the defense budget and declared a unilateral reduction in
forces of 500,000 soldiers and 10,000 tanks.
   _ Informally agreed with United States on troop reductions in
Central Europe.
   _ Agreed with the United States to destroy medium-range missiles
and try for a second treaty in 1990 reducing long-range nuclear
weapons by 50 percent.
   _ Brought home the 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan.
   _ Changed foreign policy from a struggle with capitalist
countries to cooperation with them in fulfilling such ``universal
human values'' as the desire for peace and a better life.
   DEMOCRATIZATION
   _ Introduced competitive elections in 1989, won agreement from
the Communist Party leadership to end its constitutional monopoly
on power and vested legislative authority in a new parliament.
   _ Proposed broad new presidential powers, including the right to
suspend the legislatures of republics.
   _ Promised legal guarantees of a freer press, freedom of
assembly, freedom of religion and the right to a fair trial.
   _ Released hundreds of political prisoners and ended persecution
for political views.
   _ Virtually opened the borders, but has not produced a promised
law on free exit and entry.
   ECONOMIC POLICY
   _ Failed to improve the daily life of ordinary Soviets, who face
inflation, rationing and worse shortages than before. Delayed
needed reform of prices that have have no relation to costs and
waste scarce resources.
   _ Won Communist Party leadership's acceptance of private
ownership of factories.
   _ Obtained parliamentary approval of leasing land to
individuals, with the right of inheritance, but refused to legalize
private ownership of land.
   _ Made foreign investment easier through joint ventures.
   _ Legalized small private business cooperatives, but did not
guarantee them adequate legal sources of supplies.
   _ Revealed the long-secret Soviet budget deficit, which this
year reached 90 billion rubles, $150 billion at the official rate
of exchange.
   DOMESTIC POLICY
   _ Permitted independence movements to develop in the Baltics and
the Caucasus.
   _ Sent tens of thousands of Soviet soldiers on peacekeeping
duties in restive republics, but could not halt ethnic and
nationalist conflicts in which 500 people died in the past two
years.
   _ Adopted the cause of environmentalists, but succeeded in doing
little to improve polluted air, water and land.
   _ Promised a dramatic increase in housing, but has achieved no
visible results.
   _ Restricted production of alcoholic beverages to reduce
alcoholism, at a cost to the treasury of billions of rubles.
Campaign succeeded in toughening public attitude toward drunkenness.

   Terry Briggs has baby-sat, house-sat and
dog-sat, learning along the way she couldn't just sit.
   For eight years, Briggs worked at General Motors Corp.'s Buick
City in Flint, birthplace of the largest U.S. automaker. In October
1987, the company said she no longer had a job and that it probably
wouldn't rehire her.
   Since then, she's been trying to piece together a life on
layoff, a life of odd jobs, overdue bills, day-time TV, handouts,
handiwork, boredom and anxiety. ``Just when I think it's not going
to work, somebody comes up with something,'' said Briggs, 42, whose
cheeriness belies her nagging nervousness about living from hand to
mouth.
   She is among thousands of Americans who have been laid off from
jobs in auto assembly, component and supplier plants, which are
struggling because of a recession in the auto industry.
   Factories have closed, work has dried up and people like Briggs,
in the nebulous category of too young to retire and too old to find
a new job, are scrambling to pay bills.
   For Briggs, working for GM has come back to haunt her.
   ``The job search hasn't been good for me,'' she says. ``I'm a
fat, 40 (year-old) female and a General Motors employee.'' She says
some potential employers shy away from GM workers because ``they
are too spoiled, they want money, they want benefits.''
   Pay and benefits can be worth more than $40,000 a year to
autoworkers who have some overtime. Many of those laid off often
balk at the prospect of looking hard for a job that pays less.
   Barbara Jubar, a clinical social worker with Catholic Social
Services in Flint, where many autoworkers are unemployed, says they
often resist training for another profession.
   ``Why should I train to do something that is one-third of what I
made before?'' she says, quoting a common response among her
clients. ``I think it's just a reluctance to think more long-term.''
   Clarence Cobb of Detroit was among 1,700 workers who lost their
jobs Feb. 2 when Chrysler Corp. shut its famous Jefferson Avenue
plant, once a symbol of Chrysler's might but now relegated to the
scrap heap. He's a 22-year oldtimer with Chrysler, but a youngster
in the layoff ranks.
   ``It hasn't set in yet,'' Cobb, 42, says. His wife's salary from
her job as a district court supervisor in Detroit helps pay the
bills.
   Cobb watches a lot of TV; soap operas are his favorites. He's
going to be a grandfather soon, and that's sure to take up some of
his time, he said.
   Cobb might return to work next year when Chrysler begins
training employees to build a sport-utility vehicle at a new
factory rising beside the hulk of the Jefferson Avenue plant. But
his job prospects are uncertain.
   ``It's a waiting game right now,'' Cobb says.
   For many autoworkers, the waiting game is nerve-racking, partly
because they don't know how long their money will last.
   Cobb, Briggs and others on layoff were eligible for unemployment
and other payments, including a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit,
tailored for autoworkers and designed to yield up to 95 percent of
their pre-overtime take-home pay. With so many layoffs this year,
however, the SUB funds are shrinking.
   ``I never got 95 percent of my wages,'' Briggs says. ``They
dropped it down to 75 percent the day I was laid off because of the
strain on the SUB fund. I was OK while I still had the SUB.''
   When her SUB allotment ran out in April 1988, Briggs says, she
filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``That was the most difficult thing I've ever done,'' she says.
``The humiliation just doesn't go away.''
   Studies have documented increased cases of alcoholism, drug
abuse and family problems among laid-off workers, mainly because of
the stress a job loss puts on individuals and their relationships
with loved ones.
   ``To understand the process that a laid-off employee goes
through, you must understand that our jobs and our self-confidence
are very intertwined,'' says Dr. Nyk Bartkiw, director of
outpatient services at a community mental health program in
Michigan's Genesee County, where many laid-off autoworkers live.
   ``The first reaction is that `I'm a nobody, I don't have a job
anymore,''' Bartkiw says. ``We have to help them get over that
first step. You are more than a job.''
   Briggs has performed a constant juggling act trying to channel
whatever income she can scrape together toward the final notice
bill with the earliest due date.
   She still owes money on her 1986 Chevrolet Nova, a car that sits
with a blown engine. Her apartment rent is supplemented by general
assistance welfare money, and her landlady is lending a hand with
utility bills.
   She used to sew. But her assembly-line work led to carpel tunnel
syndrome, a hand-weakening affliction in factory workers who
perform the same tasks repetitively. Clothes-making is out.
   Other people pay some of her bills, often on what amounts to a
barter system. If she paid the bills in cash it might endanger her
benefits, which include $99 a month in food stamps and assistance
with her $200-a-month payments for heart and diabetes medicine.
   ``I have a friend who has a dog and when she goes away, I go
house-sit and dog-sit for her and then she pays my rent or
whatever,'' Briggs says. ``That's kind of hard because she's a dear
friend and I really don't like her doing that.''
   Briggs has given of herself, too. She recently helped deliver
Christmas baskets to the needy with other members of a Masonic
Lodge.
   ``Man, I was ashamed of myself for even worrying about me
because every house I went to was worse than the last one,'' she
said. ``I think the thing is that nobody cares about them. There
are a few of us who do, but not nearly enough.''

<HEAD>Five Years Lost in Lebanon's Black Hole; But `Feeling of Hope'
Renewed</HEAD>

   Five years. Time enough for a world to change. Years enough for
a newborn to sprout into girlhood. Nights enough for a man, caged,
to sink into dark despair, and then sink deeper still.
   Five years ago this Friday, on March 16, 1985, Associated Press
correspondent Terry A. Anderson was shoved into the back seat of a
Mercedes and driven off into the black hole of Beirut. He remains a
hostage today, longest-held of eight American and 10 other Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   Anderson, now 42, last spoke to the world 16 months ago, in a
videotape released by the Moslem extremists who hold him. In a gray
track suit, clean-shaven, he looked stronger than in the past. But
the spirit was bleak.
   ``As the end of my fourth year approaches,'' he said, ``I find
it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.''
   Now the end of his fifth year approaches.
   Hopes so often crushed are rising again. Anderson's tireless
sister, Peggy Say, recently returned from a Middle East journey
with AP officials and spoke of a ``feeling of hope.'' Rumors of
secret talks are flying through Europe. The president of Iran, the
nation believed to hold sway over the Lebanese kidnappers, says he
feels the hostage crisis ``is moving toward a solution.''
   Somewhere in the rubble of Lebanon, Anderson and the 17 others
are imprisoned, apparently held in small rooms, chained, often
blindfolded, deprived of sunlight, deprived of faith, lost in a
hopelessness that at one point drove Anderson to pound and bloody
his head against a wall.
   The meaning of five years of inhuman captivity, each year a
near-eternity, is beyond imagining. But a simple measure of time
can be taken:
   On the day Anderson was kidnapped, Mikhail Gorbachev was in his
first week of power in Moscow. Ronald Reagan had not yet met a
Soviet leader. Marcos and Duvalier still ruled. Chernobyl still
operated. The Challenger astronauts still drilled for their fateful
flight.
   While Anderson endured his pains, wars yielded to peace, enemies
embraced as friends, history remade the world's landscape. While
Anderson lay in chains, his second daughter, Sulome, was born and
grew into a lively 4-year-old, a girl deprived of a father's warmth.
   The ``senior'' hostage is also the youngest hostage, and perhaps
the best-known, among an American group that also includes
Scottish-born, poetry-loving academic Thomas Sutherland; accountant
and Moslem convert Joseph Cicippio; adventurous schoolmaster Frank
Herbert Reed; sometime-writer Edward Tracy; journalism professor
Alann Steen; business teacher _ and diabetic _ Robert Polhill, and
math professor Jon Turner.
   Anderson the reporter, now locked up by Moslem militants in a
makeshift dungeon, had once huddled with fearful Moslems in other
basements, under Christian bombardment, there to tell their story
to the world.
   A hard-driving, self-assured journalist, the AP's chief Middle
East correspondent covered Lebanon's endless tragedy with grit and
aplomb. Jazz blared from his automobile tape deck as he dashed from
crisis to crisis.
   Covering Lebanon sometimes meant ``having to drive through one
war to get to the war you're covering,'' he explained.
   Anderson brought a broad reporting background to Lebanon. He
covered desegregation in Kentucky, the struggle for democracy in
South Korea, the fight for racial justice in South Africa.
   Not taciturn, but judicious with words, not unfriendly, but
serious about the task at hand, Anderson took on journalism with
the discipline of a Marine _ his onetime calling. ``I like where
I'm at,'' he told a nephew who interviewed him for a school
assignment.
   A day after Anderson was grabbed off a Beirut street by four
gunmen, an anonymous caller reported he was being held by ``Islamic
Jihad'' _ Islamic Holy War _ an underground Shiite Moslem group
that had begun kidnapping Westerners a year earlier.
   Six other Americans and Britons were already held by Islamic
Jihad and other shadowy bands in Lebanon. Four eventually were
freed; the two others died in captivity.
   In the months that followed, other Americans, Frenchmen, Britons
and West Germans _ one by one, sometimes two by two _ were
kidnapped by extremists trying to strike out at Western governments
they considered to be always on the wrong side of the Mideast's
many conflicts.
   Islamic Jihad's goal was a trade: its hostages for 17 Islamic
Jihad comrades imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies there. Otherwise, it said, it would ``execute'' its
captives.
   But President Reagan vowed ``no concessions ... no deals.''
   Periodically, the hostage impasse seemed to move toward
resolution, as when negotiations on Iranian assets frozen in the
United States made major progress last year. But the low points far
outnumbered the high.
   In June 1986, cancer-stricken Glenn Anderson Jr. made a
videotape appeal from his sickbed for his brother Terry's freedom.
Four days later, he died. Four months earlier, their father, Glenn,
also was lost to cancer. Terry Anderson apparently has never been
informed of either death.
   In November 1986, the Iran-Contra affair exploded. It was
disclosed the Reagan administration had arranged secret arms
shipments to Iran, via Israel, that apparently led to hostage
releases. The resulting political firestorm shut down this
``back-channel'' dealing.
   One of the hardest blows came in January 1987. Anglican Church
official Terry Waite, a longtime mediator in the crisis, dropped
from sight in Beirut _ a victim himself of the kidnappers.
   At one point, Islamic Jihad mocked those who dared hope.
   ``What everyone expects soon is a mirage assumed to be water by
a thirsty man,'' it said in a statement in mid-1988.
   Life as a hostage, according to the freed men, is a relentless
monotony, punctuated by moments of terror and dread.
   They were moved periodically, blindfolded and at night.
Sometimes they were confined alone, sometimes thrown into cramped
rooms together. They were chained to walls or fixtures, and were
allowed only brief minutes in a bathroom each day.
   They fought the maddening monotony through exercise, talk and
reading _ of a battered Bible and a handful of other overworked
books. Sometimes they cried, but they also dreamed, prayed, planned.
   ``Terry was always creating things, his farm, his restaurant,
his house,'' said the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a released hostage.
``Terry Anderson is a unique and gifted person.''
   The freed hostage who last saw Anderson, Frenchman Marcel
Fontaine, released in 1988, remembers the American's courage.
   ``When I was a little sick and dispirited,'' Fontaine recalled,
``I said to Terry that I'm not afraid to die, but I don't want to
die here and have them throw my body into the sea.''
   Anderson thought a moment, he said, and replied, ``I don't want
to die anywhere.''
   Family, friends, colleagues and other supporters gather Friday
in ceremonies in Washington and elsewhere to reaffirm their faith
in the eventual release of Anderson and the other hostages.
   And they will pray that Anderson himself, after five pitiless
years, may still find some faith and comfort _ in his own worn
Bible, perhaps, or even in his jailers' Koran, the holy book whose
Sura 94 reassures the tormented that ``verily, with every
difficulty there is relief.''

   JAN. 8 _ Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, Roman Catholic priest,outhern
region and 1 billion in the Northern region.
   The Northwest also generated the most jobs and income, 55,709
and $1.9 billion. Others were Pacific Southwest, 20,811, $765.5
million; Northern, 13,590, $452.8 million; Southern, 10,469, $249.6
million; and Eastern, 9,287, $368.1 million.
   The Forest Service said 56 of the 122 national forests with
commercial timber sale programs returned more money than they spent
last year. Those forests were primarily in California, Washington,
Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and the in the Southeast.
   Total operating expenses for the timber sales program were
$776.7 million in fiscal 1989, the service said.
   The report said the kinds of wood harvested in different forests
account for much of the regional variance in sales.
   ``A possible explanation for the decline in Region 8 (Southern)
is that a large amount of its timber volume is used for pulpwood.
The pulpwood market did not experience a large increase in value in
FY1989 as did sawtimber,'' the report said.
   ``Alternatively, Region 10 (Alaska) experienced a large
increase. This is predominately due to improved markets and the
renegotiation of timber sale contracts with the major purchasers on
the Tongass National Forest.
   ``Through these renegotiated contracts, significantly higher
revenues are now being obtained,'' the Forest Service said.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Problems Persist Despite Bush Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Question: To which administration, President
Bush's or Ronald Reagan's, do the following three statements apply?
   _More than 500 insolvent or near-insolvent S&amp;Ls are open for
business, losing an estimated $14 million a day.
   _Beleaguered regulators hint that the administration's bailout
probably won't be enough.
   _What was thought to be a crisis resolved is once again becoming
a political liability for the president.
   The answer is: both. The savings and loan crisis is back.
   That was the situation in the waning days of the Reagan
administration in 1988 and that is the situation now, six months
after President Bush signed historic S&amp;L legislation in a Rose
Garden ceremony declaring, ``These problems will never happen
again.''
   Two years before, President Reagan had expressed similar
sentiments when signing a $10.8 billion, industry-funded rescue of
the S&amp;L insurance fund. As it turned out, that fell far short of
the amount needed. Now it's becoming clear the $50 billion provided
by the Bush bill won't be enough either.
   Bush got high marks from thrift executives, editorial writers
and even Democrats for offering a comprehensive plan to handle the
S&amp;L crisis within three weeks of taking office, and pushing it
through Congress by August.
   But, so far, he is getting low marks on execution of the plan.
   Congressional Democrats, who had been somewhat muted because of
the involvement of four Democratic senators in the Lincoln S&amp;L
scandal, are criticizing the administration more forcefully.
   ``Savings and loans have re-emerged as a political problem. The
Democrats are back and the name of the game is assessing blame,''
said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America.
   ``It's not quite at the White House gate, but it's getting
there,'' he said.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a new bailout agency run by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has moved swiftly to put failed
thrifts under government management. By the end of February it had
seized 382 institutions, with $192 billion in assets.
   But it has moved slowly in disposing of the institutions,
selling or closing only 49, mostly smaller thrifts. It has sold or
collected on about $25 billion in assets, but it's had a tough time
getting rid of ``bad'' assets: problem real estate and sour loans.
   ``What we have is a bunch of rotting S&amp;Ls out there and a bunch
of assets being managed in a passive way,'' said Bert Ely, a
financial analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   ``The longer the delay, the more costly the cleanup,'' he said.
   After recent appearances before hostile members of Congress,
administration officials promised to double the resolution pace to
50 S&amp;Ls a quarter.
   To speed real estate sales, the RTC released a 3,000-page
inventory of 30,000 properties. Anyone interested can obtain the
list for $50 by calling 1-800-431-0600.
   In the meantime, analysts, congressional critics and bailout
officials themselves offer at least three reasons for the slow
start.
   First, the sheer size of the task is unprecedented. Never before
has the government tried to sell so much to so many.
   ``What's happened in a nutshell is that Congress has set up an
organization, overnight, with responsibilities larger than
Citicorp,'' the nation's largest bank, said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,
a member of the House Banking Committee.
   Second, the cumbersome structure of the bailout apparatus,
designed to ensure the taxpayer's money is spent properly, is prone
to delay.
   An existing agency, the FDIC, supervises the RTC's work. But
another layer of administration, the RTC Oversight Board, controls
the purse strings and policy of the bailout. It's led by the
Treasury secretary and includes the Housing secretary and Federal
Reserve Board chairman.
   Tension between segments of the bureaucracy erupted in public
last month when Daniel P. Kearney, chief staff officer of the
oversight board, quit amid reports he resented interference from
the Treasury Department.
   Congressional Democrats also are upset because the White House
has not filled many positions in the regulatory bureaucracy.
   Most notably, the administration still has not found a permanent
replacement for M. Danny Wall as director of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision. He resigned three months
ago, under fire for his handling of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, Irvine, Calif., the nation's largest S&amp;L failure.
   Three of the top seven officials serving under Wall have left.
Their positions are vacant.
   A third factor in the RTC's lackluster start was uncertainty
over bailout funding. Beyond the $50 billion provided by last
summer's bill, RTC officials temporarily need much more money until
they can sell the assets of the failed S&amp;Ls.
   The administration did not approve such ``working capital''
until late February, only weeks before the RTC would have had to
stop work for lack of cash.
   It is borrowing the money through the Treasury after Democrats
on the House Ways and Means Committee blocked the administration's
plan to exclude the borrowing from the federal budget deficit.
   Another funding crisis looms. Private analysts complain the
government, even with working capital, must spend far more than $50
billion to cover failed thrifts' losses.
   In a tack reminiscent of the Reagan administration's stance in
1988, Bush administration officials say the money will last until
after congressional elections this fall.
   Similarly, Reagan officials in 1988 had insisted until after the
presidential election that the 1987 rescue of the S&amp;L insurance
fund was adequate.
   Figures supplied to congressional banking committees at the end
of January by RTC Chairman L. William Seidman, who also is FDIC
chairman, suggest that $74 billion is probably a better estimate of
the losses than $50 billion.
   They can only go higher. The industry as a whole is still
deteriorating, compiling losses of a magnitude not seen since the
Great Depression.

   The industry lost $11.5 billion in the first nine months of last
year, on track to break the record $13.4 billion loss for all of
1988.
   Meanwhile, stringent new financial standards in last summer's
legislation are forcing savings institutions to shrink.
   The rules require thrifts to back their lending with more of
their owners' money. Most can't raise the capital. As a result,
they must trim their balance sheets.
   Excluding interest, $74 billion in deposits poured out of S&amp;Ls
last year, at first because the industry's problems had shaken
customers' confidence, later because thrifts sold assets and no
longer needed the deposits.
   ``Big is no longer beautiful in the savings and loan business,''
said analyst Kenneth H. Thomas of Miami.
   Those that cannot downsize successfully _ an estimated 180 to
250 _ will fail, bringing the government's caseload to nearly 600
institutions. By the end of this year, analysts predict fewer than
2,400 solvent S&amp;Ls will remain, down from 3,200 only three years
ago.
   The survivors have little reason to welcome 1990. Weak real
estate markets have spread from the oil-producing states of Texas,
Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado to nearby Arizona and to the
Northeast, particularly New England.
   The demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the near-collapse
of the junk bond market also threatens a handful of big thrifts.
   A month ago, CenTrust Savings Bank of Miami became the first S&amp;L
to fail because of junk bond losses. It was followed by Imperial
Savings Association of San Diego, which had the industry's
second-largest junk bond portfolio.
   Thomas said Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly
Hills, Calif., with the largest junk bond holdings, around $4
billion, is shaky, too.
   Congress, which produced the S&amp;L bill in what for it was a
headlong rush of six months, likely will spend 1990 evaluating its
handiwork rather than fixing it.
   Proposals for change abound, and they'll get an airing this
month in hearings before the House Banking subcommittee on
financial institutions, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   Builders, complaining they can't get loans, are pushing for
relaxation of new restrictions on the amount of money an S&amp;L can
lend to one borrower. Thrift executives want Congress to ease rules
forcing them to concentrate more heavily in mortgage lending.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., introduced a bill that would abolish
the RTC oversight board. Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., would make the
RTC independent of both the administration and FDIC.
   Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Leach want to do away with
the thrift office and divide its duties.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., submitted legislation to forbid
financial institutions from selling their uninsured debt to their
depositors.
   Debate also is starting on what many economists say is the most
glaring deficiency of the legislation: its failure to curb federal
deposit insurance.
   With accounts guaranteed to $100,000, depositors have no reason
to withdraw their money even when S&amp;L and bank owners make wildly
speculative investments, the economists argue.
   The Treasury Department, Congress' General Accounting Office,
the FDIC and trade groups all are working on proposals for reform.
   Unprodded by the administration, however, most legislators have
little appetite for dealing with savings and loans during an
election year.
   Those watching from the wings say the administration would be
wise to press for change now, rather than waiting until next year.
   ``I think this administration still has the opportunity to
distance itself from this problem,'' said attorney John Hawke, a
former Federal Reserve regulator now in private practice.
   But ``it's not going to be very long before it becomes their
problem,'' Hawke said, ``and at the next election all the voters
are going to remember is the Bush administration failed to clean
(it) up.''

   Here are brief sketches of eight American kidnap victims still
missing in Lebanon:
   TERRY A. ANDERSON, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985. He was born in Lorain,
Ohio, reared in Batavia, N.Y., and graduated from Iowa State
University. He worked at AP bureaus in Tokyo and Johannesburg
before being assigned to Beirut.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican congressman from upstate New York
once was nominated for vice president on the grounds that he used
to drive President Lyndon B. Johnson nuts. By that kind of test,
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt may yet wind up on a Democratic ticket.
   The House majority leader seems to be the Democrat most likely
to succeed at provoking President Bush and his lieutenants. He did
it again the other day with a speech accusing Bush of visionless,
no-risk leadership that has left foreign policy adrift at a crucial
time of change.
   The complaints built on Democratic themes the Bush camp had
rebutted before, but never so vehemently as when Gephardt delivered
them.
   Gephardt proposed increased U.S. foreign aid to foster democracy
in Eastern Europe and said Washington should offer direct
assistance to the Soviet Union in food and through loans and
insurance for private investment.
   Bush's spokesman dismissed it all as pure politics, said he
didn't know whether the president had even seen the criticism, and
compared Gephardt to Maxwell Smart, the hapless spy in an old
television comedy series that shows up in late-night reruns now.
   ``Can you believe he wants to raise taxes on the American people
to give money to the Soviet Union?'' said White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater called the Gephardt complaints ``just a political war
... general old political stuff but nothing substantive.''
   Gephardt, whose quest for the White House in 1988 peaked and
crashed early in the season, is becoming the point man for the
relatively placid Democratic opposition.
   Bush inadvertently broadcast his own annoyance last fall, after
Gephardt led the House opposition to his capital gains tax cut. ``I
tell you, I'm displeased with Gephardt, the way he made it so
really kind of personal,'' the president said in a telephone
comment he didn't realize was on the air at a congressional press
gallery.
   The displeasure of a president can be a merit badge for an
opposition leader. Sen. Barry Goldwater said he chose the
little-noted Rep. William Miller of New York to run for vice
president in 1964 because he ``had driven Lyndon Johnson nuts in
the past with his sharp tongue.'' It didn't work; Johnson ignored
him.
   As majority leader, and, at 49, the man in line to succeed House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley some day, Gephardt has renounced
presidential candidacy, although pledges like that don't
necessarily last forever. His leadership role and his secure
Missouri House seat _ he won his seventh term with 63 percent of
the vote _ have built him a secure platform for challenges to the
Republican White House.
   Democrats have not spared Bush their criticism, but much of it
has been low-key. Gephardt was not. In a speech at the Center for
National Policy last week, he escalated it into a frontal assault
on Bush's leadership, vision and motives. Gephardt said Bush bases
his decisions on polls and politics.
   ``The Bush foreign policy is a policy adrift without vision,
without imagination, without a guiding light save precious public
opinion polls,'' Gephardt said. ``But if he wanted to, President
Bush could seize the day and marshal the American people into a
mighty army marching for change.
   ``There is no substitute for presidential leadership,'' the
congressman said.
   Gephardt's proposals for increased aid to Eastern Europe and for
measures to help the Soviet economy were not revolutionary; most
had been discussed before, and on some, the real question is not
whether, it is when. Furthermore, farm belt Republicans were
leading promoters of subsidized U.S. wheat sales to the Soviet
Union, and that certainly is a form of aid.
   The debate on aid to the infant democracies of Eastern Europe is
over how much money to offer them and where to find it in a
strapped federal budget. Gephardt argues, as do many other
Democrats, that Bush should take the funds away from the Pentagon.
   ``Why does he want to spend billions of dollars on armaments
aimed at communists who don't want to be communists any more?'' he
asked.
   That question and others like it will be major, lasting issues
as a divided government tries to deal with drastic change at home
as well as abroad. While Gephardt may have made his point by
raising them and by toughening the Democratic challenge to Bush's
``do polls, risk nothing'' leadership, it wound up as a one-man
show. He didn't try to line up other Democrats in advance, few were
signing on afterward, and some rejected the politically risky idea
of aid to Moscow.
   Bush and the Republicans are not alone in keeping watch on voter
opinion. Democrats can read polls, too.

<HEAD>Researchers Exploring High-Tech Ways to Get Ice Off Roads</HEAD>

   Call it Skid Wars: The scientific quest for
better ways to clear ice off roads is focusing on cracking it,
sabotaging it, sandblasting it and even zapping it with microwaves.
   Roads that resist the tight grip of an ice patch are under
study. And under one strategy, motorists would loosen ice just by
driving on it.
   The research is part of a $6.5 million program administered by
the National Research Council, an arm of the congressionally
chartered National Academy of Sciences. It is seeking alternatives
to spreading salt, which can pollute the environment and eat away
at autos, and prying ice with snowplow blades, which takes lots of
energy and chews up pavement.
   Scientists are aiming to design machines that remove ice while
moving at 20 miles an hour, as well as pavements that shed ice more
easily. Results are preliminary, but researchers say they see some
promise.
   One basic problem they face is that ice sticks tightly to a
road, both by chemical bonding and by interlocking with tiny
crevices in the pavement.
   Ice binds more tightly to pavement than to itself, which is why
a snowplow blade can shear off the top of an ice patch without
removing the layer that grips the road, said Albert Wuori of the
Keweenaw Research Center of Michigan Technological University in
Houghton.
   That's where the microwaves come in. They can pass through ice
and warm the pavement, melting the thin layer of ice that touches
the road surface.
   ``All we want to do is ... destroy that bond between the ice and
the pavement, which then makes the rest of the ice very easy to
remove,'' Wuori said. Trying to melt all the ice would take too
much energy to be practical.
   An experimental device with about 30 times the power of a home
microwave oven has loosened ice from experimental pavement in the
laboratory, said Jack Monson of Research Associates of Syracuse,
N.Y.
   The process is too slow to be practical. Researchers hope that
treating pavement surfaces with microwave-absorbing materials will
make them warm up faster and hasten the melting.
   Another strategy would use spikes to punch partway into icy
patches and make them crack. High-pressure injections of antifreeze
into the cracks might then be able to pry ice off the road, said
Kazuhiko Itagaki of the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and
Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H.
   If not, injections of a de-icer might weaken the ice's grip on
the pavement and make later removal easier, Wuori said.
   Research so far has shown ``pretty much success with a single
spike plunger,'' and it is now focusing on multiple plungers, Wuori
said. The holes would have to be punched inches apart, he said.
   Still other approaches are more direct. A sandblasting device
has blown away strips of ice a half-inch thick in laboratory tests,
said Mark Osborne at the Keweenaw center. But it works much too
slowly, he said.
   It might take multiple sandblasters or a rotary system like the
brooms on street sweepers to cut a wide enough swath for practical
use, he said. Perhaps a sensor could let an ice-removal truck
adjust the height of its nozzles according to the thickness of the
ice, so the spray will not harm pavement, he said.
   A similar device that uses liquid instead of air to carry
abrasives has cut through four inches of ice without trouble, said
Michael Ohadi at the Michigan school. Again, a key challenge is to
make such a system cover ground faster.
   Researchers have not given up on snowplow blades. If they can
work with less energy, smaller trucks can be used, saving on the
sticker price and fuel consumption, Wuori said.
   One energy-saving goal is to make the bottom of the ice slab
crack continuously ahead of the moving blade, Wuori said. Computer
calculations are testing different blade shapes and angles of
attack on the ice.
   Other studies focus on new kinds of pavement that would help
break the grip of ice, or prevent the stubborn bond from forming.
   One plan involves motorists. The weight of their vehicles might
be deflected to shear ice off pavement. Computer calculations at
the Midwest Research Institute in Kansas City, Mo., show that
patterns of ridges in the road might do the trick, Wuori said.
   A similar strategy involves mixing bits of rubber with asphalt
so that the pavement surface will bend a small fraction of an inch
under the weight of a vehicle. That action could tear ice away from
the pavement, Wuori said.
   Researchers also are getting early ``glimmerings of success''
from mixing ice-fighting additives into asphalt before it is laid
as pavement, said Bernard Baum of Springborn Laboratories in
Enfield, Conn.
   If the asphalt can resist strong bonding from ice, icy patches
will be easier to remove, he said.
   To be practical, this special asphalt would have to work against
ice for years. The hope is that a continuing supply of additives
would be available at the road surface, brought up by migrating
water and exposed as the surface wears down.
   Future work may find additives that can be spread on existing
pavement, which would be cheaper than mixing them in before laying
asphalt, he said. So far the work has concentrated on asphalt,
which covers 90 percent to 95 percent of pavement in this country,
he said.
   Baum noted that to be useful, ice-fighting additives would have
to be environmentally safe and not weaken the pavement.
   And one other thing.
   ``You can't put anything on there that would be slippery,'' he
said.

   When babies fail to form trusting

quick answer: Blame Mom.
   Now a new view is taking hold. Some infants _ especially fussy
ones _ put up a barrier that has nothing to do with their mothers'
skills or compassion.
   In short, the new wisdom holds: Blame Baby, too.
   ``The mother is off the hook, at least in part,'' said Dr.
Carroll E. Izard.
   Delving into infants' emotions has become a rich field of
research. Developmental psychologists are busy sorting out
emotionally responsive infants from stoic ones, tracking down the
source of emotional responses inside their young heads and even
measuring which side of babies' faces break into the brightest
grins and the deepest frowns.
   Izard, a researcher at the University of Delaware, is
challenging the traditional notion that mothers are entirely
responsible for building secure relationships with their babies.
   He has found that babies who respond strongly and negatively to
noises and other stimulation _ in short, the very fussy ones _ are
also most likely to develop poor bonds with their mothers.
   ``Previous research puts the onus on the mother,'' said Izard.
``I'm saying this is a two-way street. Characteristics of the
infant contribute, as well.''
   His study, conducted on 81 infants, found that those who cried
the most, who demanded the most attention and who put up the
biggest fuss during mildly stressful situations during their first
months of life also turned out to be the least secure at 13 months
of age.
   He and his colleagues found they could use an electrocardiogram
to predict which newborns would go on to have insecure bonds with
their moms. Those with the strongest vagal tone _ a measure of the
influence of the brain on the heart _ later produced the highest
insecurity scores on psychological tests.
   In Izard's study, a quarter of the babies formed poor bonds with
their mothers. Other research has shown that such children are more
likely to have psychological problems when they reach school age,
such as extreme shyness and difficulty playing with other
youngsters.
   The latest work suggests that the seeds for these social
problems are sewn in a baby's genes at birth.
   Izard outlined his findings recently at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans.
Other researchers at the meeting described other ways of delving
into the earliest emotions of childhood.
   For instance, Dr. Tiffany Field of the University of Miami
Medical School has tested babies' willingness to mimic grownups'
facial expressions of happiness, anger, sadness and surprise. About
20 percent, it turns out, are great apers, bursting into wide grins
and gaping surprise in response to adult cues. Another 20 percent
stay stone-faced, while the rest fall somewhere in between.
   ``Expressivity is something that is individually different right
from the start,'' she said.
   Dr. Nathan A. Fox of the University of Maryland has found that
different emotions are seated in different sides of babies' brains.
He measured youngsters' brain waves on EEGs. Among other things, he
found that when babies smiled at their mothers, the left side of
their brains was usually more active, while the right side seemed
to be busier when they cried in anger.
   He believes that learning more about how the frontal lobes of
babies' brains mature will provide important clues to understanding
the development of differences in personality.

   Poking through cold southern Indiana mud for
the delicate 10,000-year-old remains of an elephant-like creature
was a rare thrill for a group of scientists who struck pay dirt.
   ``It was rainy and this was a fresh construction site, so you
had awful mud. It was an awful place to be working,'' said Donald
Cochran of the Ball State University anthropology department, who
was among the scientists and volunteers who spent four days
unearthing the remains of a prehistoric mammoth.
   ``But it was a very exciting find,'' he said.
   The nearly complete skeleton, buried 10 feet deep, was
discovered by a bulldozer operator preparing the way for a resort
along the Ohio River.
   A call to the Indiana State Museum in Indianapolis piqued the
interest of Ron Richards, the museum's curator of paleobiology. He
immediately organized the excavating team.
   What they found _ the remains of a shaggy, 10-foot-tall creature
believed to be a Jefferson mammoth _ will keep researchers busy for
months, Richards says.
   ``The most unusual thing was to have an investigative team go
into action when it was found,'' Richards said. ``These things were
found for years and years, and someone would just take a shovel and
dig it up.''
   Studying the mammoth where it died will yield unusual
information, he said. For example, screening soil around the
mammoth revealed the teeth of a heather vole, a mouse-like creature
now found in Canada.
   Volunteers and Department of Natural Resources employees filled
out the crew of about a dozen people who worked to unearth the
skeleton in January.
   ``It was like digging through wet pie crust,'' Richards said.
   The bones that were in good shape will be cleaned, preserved and
put on display at the museum, probably in about a year, he said.
   ``A lot of the bones were very disintegrated,'' he said. ``It
was hundreds of little pieces stuck together with mud.''
   It was rare to find such a complete skeleton, he said, although
hundreds of mammoth teeth and bones have been found in Indiana.
   The find was disappointing in some ways, however.
   Cochran was looking for signs that humans might have come in
contact with the mammoth. He came up empty.
   ``There's been no good human association with them found east of
the Mississippi River,'' he said.
   The paleo-Indians wandered the area at the same time, and their
counterparts in the west are known to have hunted mammoths. No
evidence that mammoths were hunted has been found in the East, he
said.
   But the investigation isn't over. Richards said the property
owner, Two Rivers Inc., is allowing scientists the time they need
to continue their work, expected to be finished by April.

<HEAD>Garlic May Ward Off More Than Vampires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mighty enough to keep vampires at bay, garlic
has for thousands of years been considered a wondrous substance,
used to treat all sorts of ailments.
   Its real powers are less certain, though studies continue into
the possibilities that garlic can help lower blood pressure and
cholesterol, act as a painkiller and an antibiotic, and help fight
cancer.
   Some studies of garlic and heart disease included too few
people, said Nancy Ernst, a nutritionist with the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
   She also noted that because of garlic's odor, it's hard to do a
``double-blind'' study in which participants don't know whether
they're getting the real thing. And some studies used high doses of
garlic, 10 or more cloves a day.
   ``I think it would be a problem to suggest that people could get
adequate cholesterol-lowering just by adding garlic to their
diet,'' Ernst said.
   ``I think we just really don't know,'' she said. ``I think it
would be useful to have an answer, so people don't think it has
magical powers.''
   Several researchers are studying the effects on cancer of garlic
and onions, or allium vegetables.
   ``Animal and in vitro experiments indicate that compounds in
allium vegetables inhibit several types of tumors and decrease
tumor growth and proliferation,'' according to a study in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute last year, which found a
reduction in stomach cancer risk among people in a province of
China who regularly ate garlic and onions compared with those who
did not.
   Michael Wargovich of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston
said the research so far ``clearly supports that the protective
chemicals (from foods) will have to be part of the diet throughout
life.''
   Eventually, he said, food manufacturers may produce ``designer
foods'' that include high doses of food components found to prevent
cancer. But for now, he said, he and his wife ``just try to follow
the guidelines that are out there right now.''
   ``We don't know even as researchers how much is enough,'' he
said.
   Regardless of medical uses, garlic enhances the flavors of many
foods. A raw clove has just four calories. Garlic contains almost
no sodium or fat, but has some fiber and protein.
   It can make some people ill. Of course, most people don't eat
but a little, although roasted garlic heads have become a popular
appetizer. Roasting, or any cooking, reduces garlic's pungency.
It's not certain how cooking garlic affects its medical potential.
   Raw cloves can be sliced or smashed or forced through a press.
Whole cloves can be sauteed to flavor oil, but if they burn they
taste bitter. They also can be kept in vinegar to flavor it.
   Chewing fresh parsley helps counteract the bad breath garlic
causes.
   When buying garlic, look for firm heads with tight skin. It
should be stored in a cool, dark, ventilated place. Except in very
humid, hot climates, it should not be refrigerated.
   Folk medicine and lore long have depended on garlic to fight
vampires, cholera, scorpion stings, leprosy and much more.
   The journal Preventive Medicine noted that a 35-century-old
Egyptian document considered garlic useful for treating heart
disorders. Slaves building the Egyptian pyramids were said to have
eaten great quantities of garlic. Romans thought it an aphrodisiac.
Garlic juice was used on bandages to fight infections during World
War I.
   ``Part of it is just myth. You could see if someone had garlic
around their necks to ward away colds, maybe people just didn't get
in close enough contact'' to be susceptible, Ernst suggested.
   But much of it is not myth.
   Eric Block, an organic chemist at the State University of New
York, has been researching garlic and onions as possible agents in
the treatment of heart disease and has found and patented a
compound from garlic called ajoene that is ``a pretty potent
inhibitor'' of the formation of blood clots, as effective as
aspirin, he said.
   ``The garlic and onion were like detective stories waiting to be
approached by a sleuth,'' Block said.
   His laboratory work has yet to be tested on animals or people,
but Block said he has no doubts about garlic's power. In fact, one
indicator of its power _ bad breath _ has kept him from testing his
theories on himself.
   ``I'm a department chairman and I have to do a lot of
negotiating with parents, students, faculty,'' he said. ``It's a
social problem.''

<HEAD>Study Says Red Tape Hinders Medicaid Payments to AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal law lets Medicaid pay for
many out-of-hospital services for AIDS patients, but only six state
Medicaid agencies are doing so, and red tape is to blame, the Rand
Corp. says.
   Medicaid programs in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, New Jersey,
Ohio and South Carolina help pay for AIDS patients to obtain
transportation as well as services from homemakers, home health
assistants and adult day care centers.
   Such services generally are less expensive and more convenient
than hospitalization.
   But for a state Medicaid agency to pay for these services, it
must obtain a waiver under a 1985 federal law. Such waivers exempt
the agencies from the federal requirement that Medicaid offer the
same services to all patients.
   A study by the Rand Corp., a private non-profit think tank,
concluded that most state Medicaid agencies fail to take advantage
of the federal law because of complicated application and
administrative requirements for getting waivers from the Health
Care Financing Administration.
   HCFA, which sponsored the Rand study, should relax federal
controls to help make the program more attractive to state Medicaid
agencies, the study said.

<HEAD>Researcher: Chili Just Might Be Addictive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university scientist said he may have
discovered proof of what New Mexicans have joked about for years _
that chili is addictive.
   ``It's not like a heroin addiction,'' said Frank Etscorn, an
experimental psychologist at New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology in Socorro.
   The key to his theory is capsaicin, the substance that fuels
chili's eye-watering pungency, Etscorn said recently. The capsaicin
causes the body to release endorphins, natural painkillers that
race for receptors in the brain, he said.
   ``We need a fix of red or green with a side order of
endorphins,'' said Etscorn. ``We get slightly strung out on
endorphins, but it's no big deal.''
   As a natural substance, endorphins are not truly addictive
despite being more potent than morphine, Etscorn told participants
at the annual New Mexico Chile Conference.
   Many stimuli ranging from acupuncture to smashing a thumb with a
hammer trigger endorphins, he said.
   Etscorn, a specialist in addiction, said he cooks spicy dishes
and often wondered why people craved painful foods. About two years
ago he began a research project with his students.
   Etscorn used a drug called naloxone, used to counteract heroin
overdoses. The drug blocks receptors that respond to heroin. Those
are the same receptors stimulated by endorphins, Etscorn said.
   For one experiment, Etscorn gave a research subject five
jalapenos.
   ``It worked. Sweat was pouring off his nose, off his chin. His
eyes were runny. His nose was runny. And I think there was smoke
coming out of his ears,'' he said.
   ``We asked him, `Tell us when the pain is starting to subside.'''
   When the pain began to fade, the subject was given a naloxone
injection. The pain increased as the endorphins were shut out,
Etscorn said.
   Etscorn said he plans further research, although detailed
studies probably would use the active ingredient capsaicin rather
than the whole chili.

   AT&amp;T plans to issue credit cards that would
allow users to charge phone calls as well as the traditional items
paid for with Visa and MasterCard, industry sources and a company
involved in the negotiations say.
   Under the plan, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. would issue
so-called ``affinity'' Visa and MasterCards through a Georgia bank
to a group of its existing phone card holders.
   With 40 million in circulation, the AT&amp;T phone cards are the
most widely held charge cards in the nation and give the company a
huge roster of potential customers for the new cards.
   US Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance phone
company, in December began issuing a Sprint Visa Card that combines
the features of its phone charge card with those of the bank card.
   AT&amp;T has been in negotiations with Synovus Financial Corp., a
bank holding company based in Columbus, Ga., to issue the credit
cards, Synovus said.
   Total System Services Inc., a Columbus-based credit card service
company controlled by Synovus, would process the transactions from
the AT&amp;T cards under the plan, TSS said. TSS is the nation's
second-largest credit card transaction processing company.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Bruce Reid on Wednesday confirmed the
negotiations.
   ``We're in a highly competitive marketplace and looking at a
number of ways of enhancing the AT&amp;T credit card,'' he said. The
card competes with similar cards issued by Sprint and MCI
Communications Corp., the second-largest long-distance phone
company.
   Reid also confirmed reports that AT&amp;T hired several credit card
experts in recent months. He declined to comment further on AT&amp;T's
plans.
   Neither MasterCard nor Visa U.S.A. Inc. would discuss the AT&amp;T
proposal.
   According to The Wall Street Journal, AT&amp;T will announce its
credit card plans in an advertising campaign starting March 26. The
Journal said AT&amp;T would waive the card's annual fee for at least
the first year and offer a lower annual interest rate than most
other bank cards, around 14 percent or 15 percent.
   The current long-distance phone cards are not revolving credit
accounts like MasterCard or Visa, meaning balances must be paid in
full each month.
   Several industry analysts said they believed AT&amp;T at one time
considered issuing its own credit card to compete with MasterCard
and Visa. AT&amp;T would not comment on the speculation.
   Fierce competition in the credit-card industry may have
dissuaded AT&amp;T from such a plan, said Robert Morris III of Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Discover Card was the last separate
national card to break into the industry and the retailer endured
several years of steep losses before turning the operation around.
   American Express began offering its Optima revolving charge card
to holders of its regular credit cards several years ago.
   Morris said AT&amp;T evidently believes it can increase the use of
its phone network through the new credit cards. In addition, the
company would get a share of the interest and fees charged to
cardholders.
   Sprint said it launched its Visa card, in conjunction with State
Street Bank and Trust Co. in Boston, to help promote use of its
phone network.
   ``It was a way of targeting high-travel users who spend a lot on
telecommunications,'' said Hal Poel, Sprint's director of card
marketing.
   With the Sprint Visa, phone calls charged on the card appear on
a customer's monthly Visa bill and can be charged to the Visa
account.
   MCI has no plans to issue affinity credit cards, said spokesman
John Houser. ``There seems to be enough players in there right
now,'' he said.

   Glasnost and perestroika translate into burgers
and fries for the McDonald's Corp., which plans to further expand
its fast-food empire in Eastern Europe.
   ``We've been in Eastern Europe, so we're not reacting to recent
political developments there,'' McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling
said Wednesday. ``We've been planning for this area for years.''
   But he added: ``Political developments there open up promising
aspects for us.''
   The suburban Oak Brook-based company opened restaurants in
Hungary and Yugoslavia in 1988, and is expanding its presence in
both countries, Ebeling said.
   McDonald's also is eyeing East Germany and Czechoslovakia, while
Poland is in its ``long-term plans,'' he said. ``East Germany and
Czechoslovakia are likely for the next step in development, but not
necessarily this year,'' he said.
   Michael Kennedy, an IDS Financial Services analyst specializing
in the restaurant business, believes if anybody can succeed in
Eastern Europe, McDonald's can.
   ``I'm always in awe of McDonald's management. They are able to
do things other people say you can't do,'' Kennedy said. ``They are
awfully bright and they see opportunities others don't.''
   Innovation also has played a role. For example, to ensure
french-fry supplies for their new Moscow restaurant, McDonald's
took seedlings for a new strain of potatoes from Holland years ago
and planted them in Russia.
   The restaurants in Hungary and Yugoslavia, as well as the first
Soviet McDonald's, which opened Jan. 31 in Moscow, have been doing
well.
   ``There's lots of pent-up demand for consumer goods,'' Ebeling
said. ``McDonald's is a welcomed addition, something not otherwise
available.''
   In Eastern Europe, Ebeling said, ``It's pretty much the same
menu _ hamburgers, french fries, Coke and milkshakes. It's simpler
than the U.S. menu. Breakfast is not served in Eastern Europe, and
there's not the same range of products.''
   Still, some U.S. investors have been leery of the risk in doing
business in Eastern Europe.
   ``Wall Street wants overnight success,'' Kennedy said. ``They
want to know, `Why does it take three or four years for a profit?'
   ``McDonald's invested $50 million in Russia and only has one
store, but five years from now, they will have a major position,
and others will be left out in the cold,'' Kennedy said.
   ``There are 350 million people in Eastern Europe, and your eyes
get big when you look at the consumer market over there,'' he said.
``But these people don't have any middle-class spending power and
it will be a long, long time until anything of significance comes
out of it.''

<HEAD>News and Sing-Alongs: Investors Plan Radio Network for Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors have announced plans for a radio
network of satellite-delivered programs appealing to children under
12 with music, jokes, stories, sing-alongs and the news.
   Orlando station WPRD-AM, which now airs big-band music, will
switch to a round-the-clock format for children at the end of this
month, becoming the flagship station for the Kids' Choice
Broadcasting Network.
   ``This is more than a commercial endeavor,'' the network's
president, Norman Wain, said. ``We're doing this because we really
think we can make a contribution to stimulating children's
imaginations, and imagination is the first step to literacy.''
   Investors are seeking to raise $3 million to $4 million to
launch the 24-hour network and hope to have 100 subscriber stations
in the nation's top 20 markets by next year.
   They have an impressive list of personalities on an advisory
board, including singers Judy Collins, Harry Belafonte and Pete
Seeger; children's television host Fred Rogers; and actors Marlo
Thomas and Mike Farrell.
   The format is based on children's programming at KPAL in Little
Rock, Ark., which was on the air from 1985 to 1988 and won a number
of national awards. A staff of 10 will play music, tell jokes and
stories, preside over sing-alongs and present the news.
   It will feature original music by Peter Yarrow of the folk trio
Peter, Paul and Mary, and children's music by national and
international artists familiar to children but largely unknown to
most adults _ including Raffi, Rosenschontz, Jonathan Sprout, Peter
Alsop and Bill Harley.
   Each part of the day will be geared toward a different age group.
   The approach is healthy, wholesome and educational, said
Katherine Henslee, vice president of programming.
   ``If you want them to listen, it has to be entertaining,'' she
said. ``Children also want to learn. They want information, so it's
very informative through the various elements of each show.''
   Ms. Henslee, a former educator, and other officials of the
proposed network were behind the KPAL programming.
   On WPRD, ``Satellite Sam'' Cooper, 23, will be the host between
the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., with music, humor and news from
the Weekly Reader, a children's publication. A show designed for
kids 5 and younger from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. will feature educational
music about colors, shapes and numbers. The host will be Susan
Pines, 22.
   From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., ``Curbside Carnival'' will have travel,
stories and songs about other states, lands and languages by
children's musicians.
   Later programs will have current music for older children,
jokes, nighttime stories and variety shows.
   The radio personalities ``are open and like children,'' Ms.
Henslee said. ``Their voices are warm. It's real upbeat.''
   The station will offer a toll-free telephone number so children
can call during the daily talk programs and ask questions.
   ``I think it's going to be an absolute sensation because it's
filling a need,'' said Wain, a partner in Metroplex Communications,
which owns WPRD in Orlando. ``Kids under 12 are an unserved
audience.''

<HEAD>Pathe's Purchase of MGM-UA Marks Step in Hollywood Globalization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed $1.2 billion buyout of MGM-UA
Communications Co. by European film conglomerate Pathe
Communications Corp. represents a bold step in the increasing
globalization of Hollywood.
   With overseas markets growing at an explosive pace, the merger,
if completed, will yield a balanced enterprise combining MGM-UA's
local film and television production with Pathe's worldwide
distribution, executives say.
   MGM-UA said Wednesday it had accepted the buyout offer by
Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe, which controls more
than 1,000 theaters in five countries.
   The deal concludes a drama in which an array of individuals and
companies _ from Ted Turner to the Walt Disney Co. _ considered
buying all or part of the legendary studio.
   ``The thing that we're just excited about is the total
company,'' MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow said in an
interview. ``We believe that we're now ready to become real players
in Hollywood.
   ``With this, we've increased our library, we have what I believe
is the biggest number of screens in Europe, a studio facility in
Rome, a laboratory in Paris, a couple of thousand hours of
newsreels, new distribution channels, (Pathe's) Cannon films,'' he
said.
   Barbakow's assessment was shared by Parretti, Pathe's president
and chief executive.
   ``MGM-UA's unique library and strong distribution capabilities
complement Pathe's existing business worldwide,'' Parretti said in
a statement. ``We are confident the transaction will result in a
strong, dual company structure which will be strongly competitive.''
   Last year, foreign revenue constituted about 38 percent of
Hollywood revenue, up from 30 percent in 1980, according to the
Motion Picture Association of America.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' grossed $189 million overseas, more than
the $157 million it collected domestically. Likewise, ``Rain Man''
netted $233 million outside North America, compared to $170 million
inside.
   The MGM-UA-Pathe deal is the latest prompted by an insatiable
worldwide demand for American entertainment.
   Japan's Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures last year,
Australia's News Corp. owns Fox, and the CBS, RCA and A&amp;M record
labels are owned by Japanese, West German and Dutch companies,
respectively. England's Television South PLC owns television's MTM
Productions.
   MGM-UA has profitable TV and home video divisions and a film
distribution system in place. It has been trying to start producing
films again recently after a two-year fallow period while its
controlling shareholder, Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
sought a buyer.
   The marriage with Pathe, though, may be one of the most unusual
in Hollywood history.
   The Cannon Releasing Group, which Pathe owns, is a leading
purveyor of exploitation films, with upcoming releases including
``American Ninja 4,'' ``Lambada: The Movie,'' ``Keaton's Cop'' with
Lee Majors and Don Rickles, ``Death Warrant'' and ``Stranglehold:
Delta Force II.''
   MGM-UA, on the other hand, is one of Hollywood's jewels, with
its MGM and United Artists banners responsible for everything from
the 1939 Judy Garland classic ``The Wizard of Oz'' to the 1988
Academy Award-winning ``Rain Man.''
   Mindful of how a $1.5 billion buyout of MGM was aborted last
year when Australia's Qintex Group missed a $50 million down
payment, Barbakow said MGM already had commitments from Pathe worth
$100 million to distribute Pathe movies.
   The deal also requires Parretti to come up with $200 million in
four monthly deposits of $50 million each, with the first one due
Friday, to be placed in an escrow account. ``If for whatever reason
this doesn't close, then we have the money for damages,'' Barbakow
said.
   He said he was confident Parretti could line up financing for
the deal, but declined to say where.
   Parretti was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment. In the past, he has financed deals with help from Credit
Lyonnais Group, the international financial giant.
   Kerkorian was expected to retain the right to use MGM-UA's
familiar lion logo for his airline and theme park ventures under
the separate MGM Grand company, but his spokeswoman Mary Hardy
could not immediately confirm that.
   There were reports, too, that the studio would change its name,
but there was no announcement of what the new name might be.
   MGM-UA Communications has lost money in four of the last five
years. The studio's only major release of 1990, ``Stanley &amp; Iris,''
with Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, was a commercial failure.
   Pathe, which became a strong U.S. presence following Parretti's
purchase of Cannon Group in 1987, produces and distributes movies
worldwide. It has film production facilities in Italy, a processing
lab in France, and the rights to 500 movies and 2,000 newsreels.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound, Dollar Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped
sharply and then recovered dramatically today for its first gain
this week, while the dollar rose marginally against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 328.55 points, or 0.98
percent, closing at 33,690.89.
   The index, which shed 428.74 points Wednesday, briefly fell
below the 33,000-point mark because of arbitrage trading, said
Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   However, the index soon reversed its downward direction and
recouped more than 860 points by the end of morning trading.
   The index stayed higher as market players expected little
arbitrage selling in the afternoon, although some nervousness
remained in the market, dealers said.
   Institutional investors' buying in the afternoon session also
helped the Nikkei maintain its gains, they said. Today's trading
was moderate, with an estimated 600 million shares traded on the
market's first section.
   ``We had expected massive arbitrage selling, because today is
the last day for trading future issues that are due in March,''
Nomura said.
   Arbitrage trading is a technique for making profits from price
differences between the spot and the futures markets.
   ``But the index kept coming back even with frequent arbitrage
selling,'' he said. ``The market seems to have hit its bottom.''
   Analysts have blamed computer-aided large-scale arbitrage
trading in part for recent market losses in Tokyo.
   So far this year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index has lost
5,224.89 points, or 13.4 percent.
   Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. and the department store Mitsukoshi
joined other major companies that have canceled or postponed new
equity issues because of the market's weakness, Japanese news
reports said Thursday.
   On the foreign currency market, the dollar closed at 150.83 yen,
up 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close of 150.75 yen. It opened lower
at 150.25 yen and gradually rose back while ranging between 149.85
and 150.85 yen.
   The U.S. currency fell against the yen in the morning session
after active intervention by the Bank of Japan, but rose back in
the afternoon as participants began selling the yen to make up
their short, or oversold, dollar positions, traders said.
   ``I assume quite a few market players attempted to buy the
dollar because of their short dollar positions in the last couple
of days,'' said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a trader with Mitsui Bank.
   The dollar briefly reached 151 yen Monday, but fell bellow 150
yen the following day after coordinated intervention by members of
the Group of Seven nations, including the United States, Japan and
West Germany.
   In early trading today, many market players avoided
dollar-buying because of continuing dollar-selling by the Bank of
Japan, Hanada said.
   The central bank, which does not comment officially on its
market interventions, was believed to have sold about $800 million
today in an effort to support the yen, traders said.
   The price of benchmark 10-year No. 119 Japanese government bonds
closed at 86.66 points, marginally lower than the previous day's
close of 86.67. The bond's yield was 7.205 percent, up from
Wednesday's close of 7.20 percent.
   Although the bond price was higher earlier in the day, it
gradually fell as the yen began to weaken against the dollar,
dealers said.

   The dollar fell against most other major foreign
currencies in light, nervous European trading today.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said trading was light because market makers were wary
of more central bank interventions. Several central banks
intervened earlier in the week to stem the currency's strong rise.
   ``The market is quiet. We're unsure whether or not the Deutsche
Bundesbank will step in again,'' said a trader at a large European
bank in Frankfurt.
   Traders said the fundamental reasons behind the dollar's
strength have not changed, with continued weakness in the Japanese
yen and the West German mark.
   ``The trend is bullish, but the banks are keeping it in check,''
said a Milan trader.
   Dealers said they expected subdued trading until Friday when the
U.S. unemployment figures are due. Traders said the data could show
a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.08 yen to a closing 150.83 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 150.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday's
rates included: 1.7006 West German marks, down from 1.7075; 1.5027
Swiss francs, down from 1.5075; 5.7485 French francs, down from
5.7665; 1.9130 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9155; 1,254.37 Italian
lire, down from 1,259.00; and 1.1818 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1853.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6490, compared with $1.6388 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $401.50 a troy ounce, up
from $399.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $401.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.30, up from $400.75 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at a bid
$402.04.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.13.

   Share prices were higher at midday Thursday,
helped by scattered buying by institutions and a shortage of stock.
   Another round of good earnings reports helped and Tokyo's rise
earlier in the day also helped boost the market, dealers said.
   But because volume remained thin, traders said London would
remain vulnerable to the slightest bad news and to profit-taking.
   ``I think it's going to top out,'' said a trader at a major
British brokerage firm. ``A lot of what we've seen is technical.''
   At about noon London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was 18.7 points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,249.2.
   Volume came to 247.9 million shares at midday, compared with
193.6 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

   Disappointingly low bids caused Hilton Hotels
Corp. to take down its ``For Sale'' sign.
   The hotel-casino concern's board of directors agreed to pull the
company off the auction block after rejecting two bids, company
chairman Barron Hilton said Wednesday.
   The company went up for sale last year after a dispute over
founder Conrad Hilton's estate was settled, the chairman said.
   ``We have been considering a sale of the company, among other
alternatives, since last summer,'' Hilton said in a statement
issued late Wednesday after a New York board meeting.
   ``At the time we began the exploration process, the world
economy, the market for acquisition financing and the investment
climate for real estate and hotels were each far stronger than they
are today,'' Hilton said.
   ``The significant adverse developments in each of these areas
were reflected in the acquisition proposals we received.''
   JMB Realty, a privately held Chicago group, and billionaire Los
Angeles investor Marvin Davis were among those interested in the
hotel-casino company. Davis and various Asian bidders were believed
to have dropped out, but JMB was reported in the bidding as late as
Wednesday.
   Hilton said it will concentrate on new projects: a hotel-casino
in Laughlin, Nev., several new Hilton Suites hotels, and new
properties in London, Hong Kong, Monte Carlo, Dublin and Cancun,
Mexico.

<HEAD>Shearson Cutting About 20 Percent of Investment Bankers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix cycle designator.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s plan for 2,000
layoffs this month, including about 20 percent of its investment
banking corps, is a speeded-up version of the painful retraction
taking place on Wall Street, analysts say.
   Shearson said Wednesday that the firings will include about 200
employees in its prominent investment banking division who will be
gone from the firm by the end of next week.
   Analysts predict that Shearson, engulfed in turmoil recently as
American Express Co. seized full control of its struggling
securities unit, could lay off another 3,000 people in the coming
months.
   Because American Express wants to turn Shearson around fast,
analysts said they expect cuts to occur quickly and in bulk.
   ``The last thing you want is uncertainty out there,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, an industry analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``As soon as they identify a division or business
they don't want to be in I don't see why they wouldn't move quickly
to get out.''
   Eckenfelder and other analysts estimate that Shearson will take
a one-time charge of $450 million to $500 million against quarterly
earnings to cover the cuts and reserves against bad loans.
   The investment banking layoffs are deeper than had been
expected. Shearson officials said 120 professionals _ 80 in
corporate finance and 40 in public finance _ as well as 70 support
staff would be laid off. The division employs about 750
professionals out of 1,100 workers overall.
   Michael Madden, Shearson's co-director of investment banking,
said the cuts are taking place in all areas of the department,
which handles a variety of corporate financing and advising
activities, but that Shearson did not plan to quit any particular
field.
   ``In this climate with business in many specific areas and
across the board down it's appropriate to downsize and let your
best people remain,'' he said. ``We're trying to get as lean as we
can so that in the new environment we can get as profitable as we
can.''
   Although Shearson had planned to cut investment banking jobs,
the number grew after American Express took greater control over
the firm, Madden said.
   Wall Street is contractacting in part because of a slowdown
since the 1987 stock market crash and a decline in mergers and
acquisitions because of a sharp decline in the junk bond market.
   The industry has shrunk by more than 40,000 jobs overall since
the crash, including more than 5,000 in the collapse of onetime
powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. last month.
   According to Securities Data Co., Shearson announced just five
acquisition deals worth $5.6 billion from Jan. 1 through Tuesday,
compared to 19 deals worth $20.2 billion for the same 1989 period
and 33 deals worth $38.2 billion in 1988.
   Industrywide, the total value of deals announced was down 51
percent from last year, Newark, N.J.-based Securities Data said. In
a reflection of the slow times, Shearson is number one in the
market so far this year.
   Investment banking layoffs had been planned and some had
occurred at Shearson before late January, when American Express
ousted chairman Peter A. Cohen and began taking a larger role in
the firm's affairs.
   Shearson's new chairman, Howard L. Clark Jr., is a former
American Express executive. He and top executives are deciding what
areas to cut. American Express this week said it was buying back
all remaining shares of Shearson that it does not own, boosting its
stake from 61 percent. The company also is injecting $1 billion in
new capital to shore up Shearson's finances.
   Shearson reportedly had planned gradual cuts in investment
banking of 10 percent to 20 percent by May, allowing laid-off
workers time to search for new jobs.
   But the new layoffs were expected to take effect immediately.
Some employees in other departments who were told Wednesday they
were losing their jobs were given until Friday to pack their
belongings, and personnel department staff placed boxes outside of
offices to help them.
   Shearson is hampered by overcapacity from its 1988 acquisition
of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., outstanding temporary loans that are in peril
because of the junk bond market's collapse and a $1.1 billion real
estate loans portfolio in a shaky market.

   The government allowed the dollar to plunge
against the West German mark from October through January and
stepped in only modestly to stem its rise against the Japanese yen,
the Federal Reserve reported.
   The quarterly foreign-exchange report by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasury spent just $750
million in the three months ended Jan. 31, all of it to buy
Japanese yen.
   The relatively small purchases compared with record
interventions during the previous two reporting periods. The
government sold a record $11.92 billion in dollars during the three
months ended July 31 and $5.871 billion in the following
three-month period. The government purchased both yen and West
German marks during the periods.
   What highlighted the most recent period was ``a divergence of
the dollar against the various currencies,'' said Sam Y. Cross, a
New York Fed executive vice president who presented the report at a
news conference Wednesday.
   The dollar gained 1 percent against the yen but plunged 8.5
percent against the mark. The dollar also lost more than 5 percent
against the British pound and the Swiss franc during the
three-month period.
   But rather than characterize the dollar as weak against the
mark, Cross noted the mark ``rose against all currencies in part
for reasons affecting that currency alone, so we didn't see a need
to intervene to resist that rise.''
   The opening of the border between East and West Germany in early
November unleashed a swell of positive sentiment toward the mark,
on speculation that new immigrants would stimulate domestic demand
and that liberalization presented greatly expanded business
opportunities, the Fed said.
   ``We were hearing in the market that there was an attraction to
investments in Germany and (capital) movements into the mark,''
Cross said.
   But enthusiasm surrounding the West German currency battered the
dollar, which fell from 1.8415 marks at the beginning of November
to roughly 1.6630 marks in early January, its low for the period.
It has since recovered to the 1.7000-mark level.
   The Japanese yen, however, was buffeted by uncertainty
surrounding parliamentary elections and rumors of scandals
involving members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
   The dollar reached its low against the Japanese currency just
after Christmas at 141.70 yen but closed the period higher at
144.45 yen. Since then the dollar has continued to climb and is
currently trading at about 150 yen.
   The Fed intervened on only five occasions in coordination with
the Bank of Japan. The bulk of the intervention, $600 million,
occurred during three days in early January.
   Cross said the dollar's downward trend against most key
currencies was consistent with recent policy of the Group of Seven
industrial nations. At their September meeting in Washington,
representatives from the United States, Britain, West Germany,
Japan, Canada, Italy and France, said they favor a relatively
weaker dollar, which is seen as helping reduce the huge U.S. trade
deficit.
   The dollar received some support late in the Fed's reporting
period, when a sharp runup in oil prices due to severe cold weather
and an unexpectedly large jump in January wholesale prices raised
speculation that interest rates were not headed lower. Higher
interest rates increase returns on dollar-denominated securities,
increasing demand for the currency.
   Currency traders often are keenly aware of the activities of
central banks in the open markets, but the Fed's policy is to
comment only well after the fact. The Fed does not provide any data
on intervention by foreign central banks.

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Rejects U.S. Investor's Demand to Review Accounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese auto parts maker today rejected American
investor T. Boone Pickens' demand to review the company's financial
records.
   In a hearing in Tokyo District Court, lawyers for Koito
Manufacturing Co. argued that Pickens' demand was part of a
``greenmailing scheme,'' rather than the exercise of a justifiable
shareholder's right.
   Pickens is Koito's largest single shareholder, owning 26 percent
of the Tokyo-based firm's shares.
   It was the first hearing in a lawsuit the Texas oilman filed on
Jan. 13 following a long stalemate in his landmark battle for
increased participation in the management of Koito.
   Toyota Motor Corp., Koito's largest customer, is the
second-largest shareholder with 19 percent.
   Pickens' purchase of the shares has stirred speculation that he
is trying to force Koito to buy him back at a profit, a practice
known as greenmail. Pickens has denied the greenmail accusations.
   Lawyers for Pickens maintained that his suit was based on a
section of the Japanese commercial code that permits holders of
more than 10 percent of a company's stock to review its books.
   The court set the next hearing for May 10.
   Pickens filed the suit after he was denied a seat on Koito's
board of directors at the company's annual shareholders' meeting
last July.
   Toyota and other friendly companies together hold nearly 60
percent of Koito's 160.4 million shares, each valued at 3,100 yen,
or $20.60 at current exchange rates, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today.
   In the United States, Pickens' fight is considered by some
people to be a test of the freedom of Americans to invest in Japan
at a time when many Japanese companies are buying up U.S. companies
and property.

<HEAD>USX Stockholders To Consider Icahn's Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said today it has agreed to let
shareholders vote on a resolution by takeover strategist Carl Icahn
proposing the company sell 80 percent of its steel division.
   The company said in a statement it opposes the resolution as not
in the best interests of stockholders. The resolution is
non-binding and does not say how shares in the division would be
sold, said USX spokesman William Keslar.
   ``We could sell it either through a public offering or
shareholders,'' he said. ``It would be sold somehow.''
   Keslar said shareholders could receive the proxy material within
the next 10 days.
   The announcement came as a deadline requiring advance notice of
proxy fights against USX approached today.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, did not immediately return
calls seeking comment.
   Under a USX bylaw amendment approved in January, Icahn was
required to tell the company by the close of business today whether
he would nominate his own slate of directors at USX's annual
meeting May 7.
   Under terms of the agreement, Icahn will not nominate directors
or submit other matters for consideration at the meeting, USX said.
   Chairman Charles A. Corry had said the steel, oil and gas
giant's 60-day notice was adopted ``to prevent someone from raising
havoc at the last moment.''
   USX stock fell $1.37 to $35.62 a share Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Icahn, who owns about 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of the
company's outstanding common shares, has long been unhappy with USX
management and believes the company's stock price is too low. He
has argued in favor of the sale of USX's Marathon Oil &amp; Gas
subsidiary, which USX management does not want to sell.
   In 1988, he waged an unsuccessful proxy battle at Texaco Inc.,
hoping to unseat the oil company's board and force a restructuring
to boost Texaco's stock price.
   A Wall Street source, speaking on condition of anonymity, has
said Icahn was considering a similar step at USX.
   But Greg Drahuschak, vice president of Butcher &amp; Singer in
Pittsburgh, said he does not expect Icahn, who also is chairman of
Trans World Airlines Inc., to attempt a proxy fight.
   ``A proxy fight is time- and money-consuming,'' he said. ``You
can bet your right arm, if not both arms, that USX would fight it
vigorously and add to the expense.''
   ``I wonder if he can get the money. This is not small
potatoes,'' he said.
   Drahuschak said Icahn's standing with shareholders may be
weakened by USX's pledges to bolster the company's stock.
   ``I think the company is now in a position to control its own
fate,'' he said.
   The recent demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which financed
takeover bids by selling junk bonds, could also discourage him.
   John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia,
said ``there's more skittishness about doing highly leveraged deals
in general.''
   ``Icahn is not an Andrew Carnegie who's trying to build a steel
trust or an oil monopoly,'' he said. ``He's interested in making
sure the investment he has in place pays off.''

   The stock market gained ground today, bidding to
resume its late-winter rally as Wall Street looked ahead to
Friday's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.01 to 2,678.60 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 565 up, 359 down and
486 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.06 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department's report on employment Friday morning
promises to give investors one of the first signposts of the
economy's performance in February.
   Hopes apparently spread today that the figures would reinforce
the view that business activity was continuing to expand at a
sluggish but presumably sustainable pace.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of
perhaps 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, not far below a
275,000 rise posted for January.
   If consensus projections are met, the report will also put the
civilian unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, unchanged from the month
before.
   Hilton Hotels fell 11 to 50 after a delayed opening. The company
ended its quest for an acquirer, saying it hadn't attracted the
kind of bids it had hoped for because of adverse financial
circumstances.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.48 to 186.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .48 at 359.51.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.21 to
2,669.59.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
725 up, 742 down and 502 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 163.58 million shares, against 143.64
million in the previous session.

   Robots resembling giraffes and elephant
trunks snake around half-assembled Hondas, spewing sparks as they
weld steel frames and produce a car in 14 hours.
   Only in Japan? No, an identical factory is churning out Hondas
in Ohio. Thousands of U.S.-built Hondas will be shipped to Japan,
and thousands more of the Japan-built Hondas will be sold in the
United States.
   ``Global'' is the theme in Japan's thriving auto industry.
Honda, Toyota and Nissan are building more cars abroad and slowly
blurring the national origin of automobiles, historically one of
the most powerful symbols of a country's manufacturing might.
   The strategy makes sense to Japanese auto companies because it
can deflect or defuse trade tensions from countries growing hostile
to Japan's barrage of exports. The strategy also places
manufacturing and assembly closer to buyers, which can cut costs.
Ultimately, much of the profit still flows back to Japan.
   ``We do business according to our philosophy of manufacturing
products in the market in which they are sold,'' says Honda Senior
Managing Director Shoichiro Irimajiri. Localization of research and
production facilities ``means they can become new supply bases for
Honda's global sales channels.''
   Honda says it is ready to export U.S.-made Hondas to Europe for
the first time.
   In labor-short Japan, no one grumbles about exporting jobs. To
fill labor needs the auto industry must hire part-timers, who can
make more than $2,700 a month, Irimajiri said during a tour of
Honda's 9-month-old futuristic factory at Suzuka in central Japan.
   Conveyers glide silently, raising or lowering cars automatically
depending on the work to be done. Workers wear slogans on their
white jumpsuits reading _ ``Aim for zero accidents.''
   Late last year, a sister factory built from the same blueprints
began producing in Ohio _ one of the latest additions to the
so-called ``transplant'' shops beginning to dot America's
industrial heartland.
   Honda was the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the
United States, a huge success. Last year Americans bought more
Honda Accords than any other car, 60 percent of them U.S.-made, and
late last year Honda cars were outselling Chrysler in the United
States.
   Overall, Japanese car production capacity is likely to top 1
million in the United States this year, and in Europe by 1998.
   It's an increasingly stark contrast to the problems besetting
American automakers, which have been laying off thousands of
employees and closing factories for weeks at a time because they
can't sell enough cars.
   Toyota foresees a 32 percent surge in overseas production this
year to 650,000 cars, and Mitsubishi Motors, which operates a
joint-venture plant with Chrysler, forecasts overseas production up
33 percent to 410,000. Honda's production abroad will be up 17
percent to 525,000, Nissan's up 7 percent to 683,000 and Mazda's
steady at 220,000.
   Honda and Toyota are following Nissan's lead in building
factories in Britain; Mazda is close to announcing a factory built
jointly with Ford, probably in West Germany; Chrysler is looking
for an overseas partner to build a subcompact, probably with
Mitsubishi Motors.
   Earlier this month, Mitsubishi's parent company announced it was
negotiating a cooperation agreement with West Germany's
Daimler-Benz Group, in what could provide the Japanese conglomerate
with an enormous advantage in setting up shop in Europe.
   ``None of the Japanese have any kind of sales network in
continental Europe, and it's very expensive to set one up from
scratch,'' says Rama Krishna, an auto analyst for the investment
firm First Boston (Asia). ``You'll see tie-ups between Japanese and
local or American manufacturers, a lot more joint production,
designing and marketing.''
   Many cars already have hybrid nationality. Nissan's new NX-Coupe
was designed by Americans at Nissan's design subsidiary in
California, and Mazda's new Navajo sport utility vehicle was
designed and built by Ford. Mazda builds Ford Lasers, Telstars and
Festivas in Japan, and Toyota's joint venture with General Motors
in California makes Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms.
   A new twist is shipping foreign-made Japanese cars back to
Japan. Hnda started importing American-made Accords in 1988, and
Toyota plans to start in 1992. Mazda-built Fords have been imported
since 1988, and Nissan may do the same from its plant in Britain.
Honda plans to import 50,000 U.S.-made Hondas annually by 1991,
quintupling this year's imports to Japan.
   ``It's a totally realistic goal,'' says Honda spokesman Bret
Anderson. ``Now we have the capacity to do it. It's also economical
for us, and not being done just because of trade frictions.''
   Although Japanese car exports to the United States are limited
to 2.3 million a year, they were still worth $20.9 billion in 1989
exports, Ministry of International Trade and Industry figures show.
   That represents about 40 percent of the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, and has arouseed American protectionist passions and
warnings.
   ``We the great believers are having our pants pulled down an
inch at a time by a centrally orchestrated, totally committed
economic aggressor,'' Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said
in a January speech. ``We had better develop a healthy fear of
economic subordination because we are faced with it.''
   In Europe, protectionism is rising as well, with carmakers
pressing for tighter quotas on Japanese imports. Some Europeans
have even proposed that Japanese cars built in Europe should be
counted as imports. Europeans spent a record $10 billion on
Japanese cars last year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association says.
   Japanese moves into North America and Europe have contributed to
a decline in car exports for the last four years, but that trend
partly disguises the earnings of Japanese automakers from their
foreign operations. Moreover, the value of exports are expected to
start rising again because of Japan's expensive new luxury models,
such as Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti.
   Toyota sold more than 16,000 Lexuses in the United States in the
last four months of 1989. Nissan got a slower start with sales of
1,700 Infinitis, but hasn't been selling them as long.
   The rising value clearly worries some Japanese auto executives
because it could incite more trade backlashes. Nissan President
Yutaka Kume said his company is attempting to counter the trend by
importing more auto parts from abroad in what he called an
``internationalization program.''
   Government trade officials, also sensitive to hostile foreign
reaction, have asked automakers to keep investment in new plants
and equipment from resulting in increased shipments overseas.
   Heightened exports could especially provoke a hostile response
in the United States, where the Big Three _ General Motors Corp.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. _ all reported severe earnings
declines last year.
   By contrast, Toyota's earnings in the fiscal year ending in July
were up 17 percent to $2.1 billion. Nissan reported a 77 percent
earnings rise to $868 million in the fiscal year ended last March.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Electronics Groups Propose Plans for Increased U.S.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese electronics industry groups
proposed a joint plan Thursday to boost U.S. sales of
semiconductors in Japan.
   A task force created by the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association and the Electronics Industries Association of Japan
recommended a variety of programs for increasing the U.S. share of
Japan's semiconductor market.
   Foreign semiconductor chips accounted for 12.9 percent of the
Japanese market in the last three months of 1989, according to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   The task force, composed of five Japanese semiconductor user
companies and six U.S. suppliers, called on non-Japanese chip
makers to improve their sales and service in Japan and to modify or
redesign their semiconductors to meet Japanese needs.
   Japanese companies have charged that U.S. companies do not
supply semiconductors that are suitable for the Japanese consumer
market.
   The task force, in a report, said consumer electronics products
account for more than a third of semiconductors used in Japan, but
only 7 percent of those consumed in the United States.
   The report said the five Japanese user firms presented lists of
the semiconductors used in some of their major consumer products.
U.S. firms currently are able to supply about 6 percent of the
semiconductors, and after technical modifications to existing
chips, could supply about 12 percent of the Japanese companies'
needs, the report said.
   The task force recommended that foreign suppliers be given a
chance to demonstrate their technical and product development
capabilities. To achieve this, it called for more exchange of
technical information and for increased participation by foreign
firms in the design of special semiconductors for products as they
are being developed in Japan.
   Semiconductors have been a focus of trade friction between the
United States and Japan since overcapacity in Japan resulted in
extensive price-cutting by competing Japanese makers in the United
States and elsewhere in the mid-1980s.
   In a 1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement, Japan pledged to
stop selling chips in the United States at unfairly low prices and
agreed to a goal of 20 percent of the Japanese market for foreign
semiconductors by July 1991, when the agreement expires. Japan has
called the figure a target, while U.S. companies say it was a
guarantee by Japan.
   In 1989, Japanese makers held a 24 percent share of the U.S.
semiconductor market and 51 percent of the world market, according
to Dataquest Inc., a U.S. market research company.

   Futures prices for soybeans and grain were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said futures prices were depressed by news of more
useful rain in U.S. growing areas, with additional showers forecast
in the next few days.
   Winter wheat has been directly affected by the rains, but dry
areas of the Midwest should also benefit from the rains for the
planting of corn and soybeans this spring, the analysts explained.
   Additionally, a lack of new large export business was weighing
on corn prices, they said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher,
with the contract for March at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to

   Ridership on Greyhound buses has increased each day since the
company's drivers went on strike last week, the company said today.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. spokesman George Gravely said 40,652 people
rode Greyhound buses Wednesday, the largest number since the
walkout began last Friday. The number of passengers Wednesday was
38.3 percent of the bus line's ridership on the same day last year.
   Tuesday's ridership had been 37.6 percent of last year's figure.
   There have been no negotiations between the company and the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions since talks broke
down last week and the company said Wednesday that talks ``would
not be fruitful at this time, given the present attitude of the
union.''
   Earlier today, a striking driver said he was hit by a bus as it
left the Mobile, Ala., terminal early today. Police said passengers
on the bus reported pickets crowded around the bus as it left but
the riders did not think the picket was hit. The striking driver
was treated for a bruised knee.
   Meantime, two Greyhound buses were seized at the U.S.-Canadian
border near Plattsburgh, N.Y., after they were found to be
illegally transporting Canadian security guards hired by the
company, an immigration spokesman said.
   Greyhound failed to get the special permission needed for
Canadian citizens to enter the United States to work as security
guards, said Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Duke
Austin.
   When the first buses arrived at the border, officials discovered
two passengers were employed by Greyhound as guards, Austin said.
The individuals and the two buses in which they were riding were
seized, he said.
   It was not immediately known whether any charges were filed
against the bus line or the Canadians.
   A Greyhound representative in Dallas said the buses would be
held overnight at the border. ``The buses are still there but we're
going to get them back,'' said Dana Neal.
   Some 6,300 bus drivers and 3,000 maintenance and office workers
walked off the job Friday after talks broke down over a new
three-year contract.
   The company has been operating at reduced levels, using about
700 replacement drivers plus union members who crossed picket
lines. The company says about 350 union drivers are at work; the
union says 95 returned.
   ``The cause of this strike is singular,'' union spokesman Jeffry
Nelson said Wednesday. ``The company has refused to negotiate with
the union that represents its 9,000 employees in good faith.''
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and 10 other senators asked
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to intervene as she did in last
year's Pittston coal strike by appointing a ``supermediator.'' A
spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole said she had no such plans because the
dispute is still under the normal mediation process.
   _ In Redding, Calif., about 500 mourners, half of them striking
drivers in uniform, marched in memory of a driver killed on a
picket line. The mourners were led by the widow of 59-year-old
Robert Waterhouse, who was pinned against a building Saturday by a
bus operated by a replacement driver. No charges were filed.
   _ In Richmond, Va., David W. Batchelor, president of Greyhound's
Eastern division, reiterated the company's position that the
replacement drivers are permanent hires and that strikers who
return will get jobs only as slots become available.
   _ The company obtained its 12th temporary restraining order
prohibiting violence, vandalism and interference with operations.
Several such incidents have occurred since the strike began,
including shots fired at buses in Chicago and windows and mirrors
smashed in other cities.
   Court orders have been granted in Chicago; Cincinnati;
Cleveland; Des Moines, Iowa; Jacksonville, Fla.; Los Angeles; Mount
Laurel, N.J.; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Portland, Ore.; Sacramento,
Calif., and San Francisco.

   The chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission today urged the futures industry to become more
vocal in supporting the agency's fight to retain jurisdiction over
stock-index futures.
   In a speech to the annual meeting of the Futures Industry
Association here, Wendy Gramm said futures exchange officials and
trading firms must let Congress know they object to the possible
transfer of authority over index futures to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   ``You must speak out to address these issues, to educate the
people who do not understand futures and options markets,'' she
said.
   ``They must be made aware of your commitment to continue to be
world leaders in terms of liquidity, innovation and integrity.''
   Despite tough talk by both Mrs. Gramm and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the largest market for index futures, the Merc recently
has indicated a greater willingness to compromise on the
jurisdiction issue, which surfaced in the aftermath of the 1987
stock market crash.
   The Merc said last month in an outlook for the 1990s that it
wanted to resolve regulatory issues surrounding stock-index
futures. Merc chief Leo Melamed underscored the point at a news
conference Monday to announce his retirement plans.
   ``We're willing to sit down and get these issues behind us
because these issues constantly drag us away from the business of
business, and that ought not to be,'' said Melamed, chairman of the
Merc's executive committee.
   But Melamed also said that ``if that compromise means we give
and no one else gives, forget it.''
   The SEC, which regulates stock trading, appears to be gaining
congressional support for shifting regulatory control over index
futures to the SEC from the CFTC.
   The idea also has gained favor on Wall Street. On Tuesday,
Robert Downey, a managing partner of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and
chairman of the Securities Industry Association, told a Senate
subcommittee the SEC should regulate both markets.
   Index futures allow investors to buy and sell the cash
equivalent of baskets of stocks without ever owning the stocks
themselves. The Merc trades futures on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index.
   The SEC started the regulatory tug-of-war after the October 1987
crash, which some experts believe was worsened by computer-driven
program trading techniques involving both the stock and stock-index
futures markets.
   Mrs. Gramm disputed that claim in an unusually pointed speech
three weeks ago in which she said individual investors had been
leaving the stock market since the late 1960s, so stock-index
futures, which arrived in the 1970s, were not to blame for the
recession on Wall Street.
   Critics of stock-index futures also have called for government
authority to set the amount of ``margin,'' or downpayment, that
investors must put down to buy or sell futures contracts.
   Mrs. Gramm believes the exchanges should be allowed to continue
setting their own margins.

   The stock market worked its way higher today,
bidding to resume its late-winter rally as Wall Street looked ahead
to Friday's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.44 to 2,677.03 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 706 up, 537 down and
548 unchanged.
   The Labor Department's report on employment Friday morning
promises to give investors one of the first signposts of the
economy's performance in February.
   Hopes apparently spread today that the figures would reinforce
the view that business activity was continuing to expand at a
sluggish but presumably sustainable pace.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of
perhaps 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, not far below a
275,000 rise posted for January.
   If consensus projections are met, the report will also put the
civilian unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, unchanged from the month
before.
   Hilton Hotels led the active list, down 11\ at 49}. The company
ended its quest for an acquirer, saying it hadn't attracted the
kind of bids it had hoped for because of adverse financial
circumstances.
   Compaq Computer, up 2&lsqb; at 94&rsqb;, and Businessland, up \ at 11,
were strong for the second straight session following news of an
agreement for Businessland to resume carrying Compaq products.
   USX rose ~ to 36{. Carl Icahn, the financier who owns a big
chunk of USX stock, is pressing a plan to spin off at least an 80
percent stake in the company's steel business.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .41 to 186.18. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .56 at 359.59.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 72.98 million shares at
noontime, against 81.56 million at the same point Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eastern Reportedly Refusing Concessions from Pilots Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has refused an offer of $40
million in concessions from its pilots union in exchange for
getting strikers' jobs back, according to a newspaper report.
   The report in Thursday's editions of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution quoted unidentified sources familiar with
contract negotiations under way in Washington.
   Last March, Eastern's pilots and flight attendants unions struck
the airline in sympathy with the striking Machinists union.
Although the sympathy strikes ended in November, no former striking
pilots and only 215 former striking flight attendants have been
called back to work.
   The Machinists union remains on strike against Miami-based
Eastern, which has been operating under the supervision of a
federal bankruptcy court since March 9, 1989.
   In a separate development Wednesday, the House sustained
President Bush's veto of a bill to have the government intervene in
the Eastern dispute, dealing a blow to organized labor and
Democratic leaders. Also, the Justice Department said it has no
objections to Eastern's proposed sale of its valuable Latin
American routes to rival American Airlines.
   Eastern says its pilot jobs have been filled by 800 pilots who
refused to strike or who crossed picket lines and by 1,000 new
replacements. Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association say about
1,400 former striking pilots want their jobs at Eastern back, while
an equal number have retired or found jobs elsewhere.
   On Monday, a federal mediator called ALPA and Eastern
negotiators into a new round of talks, the Atlanta newspaper said.
   Spokesmen for the union and Eastern said they couldn't discuss
details of the talks, but Eastern ALPA Chairman Skip Copeland told
the newspaper, ``We're willing to make enormous concessions.''
   The concessions totaled more than $40 million, the paper
reported.
   The report said ALPA has insisted that Eastern honor its
contract by awarding pilot jobs according to seniority, a request
that Eastern has refused. If that were done, most former strikers
would displace the replacement pilots.
   ``It appears to be a philosophical impasse, not an economic
impasse,'' Copeland was quoted as saying. ``What they're trying to
do is break the union.''
   If the National Mediation Board decides further negotiations
wouldn't be worthwhile, it can trigger a 30-day period after which
Eastern could impose contract terms and the union could strike.
   If that happened, or if Eastern asked the bankruptcy court to
void ALPA's contract, the union probably would ask members to vote
on whether to return to the picket lines.

   A dozen traders from the soybean futures pit at
the Chicago Board of Trade pleaded innocent today in a new federal
indictment totaling more than 751 charges.
   U.S. District Judge George Marovich, who also heard the innocent
plea of a 13th soybean trader Wednesday, rescheduled the trial for
the 13 from June 12 to Sept. 10 to allow lawyers more time to
prepare their cases.
   The defendants had originally been indicted in August on 539
charges involving fraudulent trading practices, but a grand jury
last week returned a superseding indictment against the 13.
   Marovich also agreed Wednesday to a motion by defense attorneys
to hold separate hearings for six of the defendants, who contend
that incriminating statements made during surprise visits to their
homes by FBI agents and prosecutors in January 1989 were
involuntary and should be thrown out.
   A total of 47 traders and a clerk have been charged in an FBI
probe of alleged fraudulent activities at the Board of Trade and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The exchanges trade futures contracts
that are used as hedges against sharply rising or falling commodity
prices .
   Those who pleaded innocent today were Scott Anixter, Bradley
Ashman, Charles Bergstrom, Edward Cox, Martin Dempsey, Joel
Fetchenhier, Thomas Kenney, Bruce Mittelstadt, James Nowak, John
Ryan, Sheldon Schneider and John Vercillo.
   William Barcal pleaded innocent Wednesday.
   The clerk, Michael Weiser, and five soybean traders have pleaded
guilty in the case.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
today he will go to Paris next month to meet with financial leaders
of the Group of Seven industrial nations to discuss recent economic
developments around the world.
   Before appearing at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing
on the Treasury Department budget, Brady was asked about a report
that he and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would travel to
Paris on April 7.
   ``Definitely,'' he replied.
   Asked further if the trip involved meetings with the G-7
leaders, he said, ``Yes.''
   Since the regular meeting of the G-7 is scheduled for May 7,
Brady was asked as he left the hearing whether there was any
urgency for the preliminary meeting.
   ``There's no special urgency,'' he replied. ``We've always had a
meeting previous to the regular meeting and this was just the time
that was picked. Last time it was in February and this time it is
in April.''
   The meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents
from the world's most powerful industrial democracies _ the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy _
would be the first such session since the dramatic changes in
Eastern Europe.
   An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States had proposed the meeting to discuss how changes in
Eastern Europe are affecting currency markets and the economic
coordination efforts among the major powers.
   In recent weeks, the value of the dollar on world markets has
climbed sharply while the Japanese yen and West German mark have
declined.
   A stronger dollar threatens to worsen America's already huge
trade deficit since it would make imports less expensive for
American consumers and U.S. products more expensive on overseas
markets.
   The G-7 countries have been coordinating efforts this week to
sell dollars and buy Japanese yen and West German marks in an
effort to dampen the dollar's climb but so far the government
currency sales have had limited impact.
   In addition to the recent volatility in exchange markets, the
G-7 officials were expected to address the question of the
unification of West Germany and East Germany. Some economists fear
this development could worsen inflationary problems in West
Germany, especially if a proposal to exchange the West German
currency for the East Germany currency on a one-to-one basis is
carried out.
   The April 7 meeting of the G-7 countries will be held just one
month before a previously scheduled May 7 meeting in Washington.

   Outboard Marine Corp., manufacturer of
Johnson and Evinrude outboard engines, says it will lay off 3,100
workers temporarily because of lagging boat sales.
   The company made the announcement Wednesday, saying it will stop
building boat engines for several weeks.
   The company said its stern-drive plant in Lexington, Tenn., will
be closed for six weeks beginning late this month. Seven outboard
engine plants, including a plant in Waukegan, Ill., that employs
580 workers, will close for two to three weeks in April.
   Slow sales which began last summer have continued into the first
quarter, said James Chapman, president and chief executive officer
of the company.
   ``We are reducing our engine production this spring to prevent
inventory from building up in our plants and in our dealers'
showrooms this summer,'' he said.
   ``We aim to improve our efficiency and competitiveness by taking
this action now to better match our production to the realities of
the marketplace.''

   OPEC Secretary-General
Subroto said he expects the oil market to remain stable through
spring, according to a published report Thursday.
   ``Demand for oil usually drops in spring. We know the behavior
of the market and the changes which accompany it, but we expect
there will be no changes,'' said Subroto, in an interview with the
state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad.
   Subroto, who uses only one name, spoke on the eve of the March
16 meeting in Vienna of the market monitoring committee of the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The cartel is committed to a production ceiling of 22 million
barrels per day for the first six months of 1990, aimed at
maintaining a reference price of $18 a barrel.
   Iraqi oil minister Essam Chalabi, in an interview with the
Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency, said he did not expect the meeting
to make any substantial changes in the existing OPEC accord.
   ``It is a meeting merely designed to take stock of the market
without taking any decisions in its connection,'' Chalabi was
quoted as saying. ``This is a chance for the oil ministers to
exchange views on the conditions of the oil market.''
   He said the full meeting of all 13 OPEC member will convene May
25, with frequent consultations on stabilizing the market and
maintaining the current market.
   Iraq's earlier call for a gradual increase in oil prices through
limiting production contradicted the stand of producers like Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, who have been calling for higher
production.
   Hisham Naser, oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC
producer, met with the Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil ministers earlier in
the week. They announced an agreement on a common policy to smooth
the way for the OPEC meetings. But no details had been disclosed.
   Oil prices reached well above the $18 mark in recent months due
to the high demand for winter fuel.
   Subroto said the usual drop in demand would be offset by
anticipated oil requirements of reforming eastern Europe.
   ``The Soviet Union was unable to meet the eastern European needs
of oil in the last few years, and these states will start looking
for alternative sources of oil supplies,'' Subroto said.
   He referred to deals already concluded between eastern Europe
and some OPEC member states, but he did not go into detail.
   Subroto also said declining production in the United States and
the Soviet Union could create a huge boost in demand in the next
five years, forcing an ``explosion'' in world prices if production
capacity was not increased.
   Subroto, of Indonesia, urged industrial states to help invest up
to $60 billion to develop production capacity to meet demand.
Current production capacity is 27 million barrels a day.

   House members who helped sustain President
Bush's veto of a bill to create a commission on the year-old
Eastern Airlines dispute say the measure wouldn't have helped the
8,500 striking workers.
   ``Why hold out false hope to those who've already been hurt so
much?'' Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said Wednesday
before a 261-160 vote to override fell about 20 votes short of the
two-thirds majority needed.
   The bill would have created a four-member bipartisan commission
to study the strike and recommend ways to resolve it.
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, challenged colleagues to be truthful
about whether a commission would help resolve the complex matter,
now before bankruptcy courts.
   ``Look at our own deficit and answer that question for
yourselves,'' DeLay said.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart praised the House action.
   ``We have long felt it was inappropriate for such action to be
taken. This lays the issue to rest. We continue to feel the
appropriate course of action in addressing the dispute is between
labor and management,'' Hart said.
   Michel and other Republicans said Bush was right to halt
government intervention because the strike by members of the
Machinists union had not created a transportation emergency in any
region of the country.
   Noting that Bush had vetoed the measure in December, Michel said
Democrats would have pressed the override sooner if they had
considered the bill an emergency.
   During the hour-long debate, as about two dozen uniformed
Eastern employees watched from the gallery, the legislation's
congressional supporters said it was ``the last, best hope'' to
save the carrier.
   ``Our government is turning its back on the working men and
women of this country,'' said Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash. ``The
president said there is no emergency, but he doesn't have to fly on
an airline that's on the verge of collapse.''
   Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, one of 25 Republicans
who voted against Bush on the issue, said the matter amounted to
``a question of national policy ... the right of people to expect
their government to look into situations like this.''
   Gingrich has also said he felt he owed it to Atlanta airport
workers, many of whom are his constituents.
   Rep. Bud Schuster, R-Pa., said Democrats had an ``uncontrollable
urge to bash the president'' but were ignoring a warning from
bankruptcy examiner David Shapiro that congressional intervention
might jeopardize the remaining 17,000 jobs at Eastern.
   Last week, Shapiro said in a report that there was evidence to
suggest that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, may have
treated Eastern unfairly in a dozen financial transactions.
   The vote marked Congress' second veto confrontation with Bush
during this election-year session. The president won the first
showdown in January, when the Senate narrowly upheld his veto of a
bill protecting Chinese students from deportation.

   WPP Group PLC, the British advertising group which
owns the U.S.-based agencies J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp;
Mather, reported Thursday its profit climbed 41 percent in 1989
even as it continued to expand rapidly.
   After-tax profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 came to 29.7
million pounds, or $49 million, compared with 21.1 million pounds
in 1988.
   Earnings per share came to 73 pence, or $1.20, compared with
54.3 pence.
   Profit before tax soared 86 percent to 75 million pounds, or
$124 million, from 40.3 million pounds a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 84 percent to 1.005 billion pounds, or $1.66
billion, from 547.1 million pounds a year earlier.
   The former J. Walter Thompson Group, acquired in June 1987, had
margins of 10 percent and its net new business billings rose 18
percent to 449 million pounds, or $741 million, the parent company
said.
   It said Ogilvy Group's margins reached 10 percent for the
portion of the year following its mid-year acquisition and its net
new business billings grew 44 percent to more than 316 million
pounds, or $521 million.
   ``The board believes that the results for 1990 will reflect
continuing progress,'' WPP said.

   The stock market gained ground today, bidding to
resume its late-winter rally as Wall Street looked ahead to
Friday's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.72 to 2,681.31
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 832 up, 571
down and 523 unchanged.
   The Labor Department's report on employment Friday morning
promises to give investors one of the first signposts of the
economy's performance in February.
   Hopes apparently spread today that the figures would reinforce
the view that business activity was continuing to expand at a
sluggish but presumably sustainable pace.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of
perhaps 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, not far below a
275,000 rise posted for January.
   If consensus projections are met, the report will also put the
civilian unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, unchanged from the month
before.
   Hilton Hotels led the active list, down 11\ at 49}. The company
ended its quest for an acquirer, saying it hadn't attracted the
kind of bids it had hoped for because of adverse financial
circumstances.
   Compaq Computer, up 3&rsqb; at 95|, and Businessland, up &lsqb; at 10~,
were strong for the second straight session following news of an
agreement for Businessland to resume carrying Compaq products.
   USX rose ~ to 36{. Carl Icahn, the financier who owns a big
chunk of USX stock, is pressing a plan to spin off at least an 80
percent stake in the company's steel business.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .75 to 186.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .84 at 359.87.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 130.40 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Elders Announces Major Restructuring, Deal With Grand Met</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elders IXL Ltd. on Thursday announced a major
restructuring under which it will spin off its agribusiness
operations into a new public company and sell other assets while
retaining its brewing business.
   Elders also said it would buy Grand Metropolitan PLC's breweries
for an undisclosed amount and enter into a joint venture with Grand
Met to operate the two companies' 8,500 pubs. Elders had been
frustrated in past attempts to expand its extensive brewing
interests.
   The announcement was made in Sydney, Australia, and a copy was
made available in London.
   The restructuring was intended maximize value for all Elders
shareholders by creating independent corporate entities focused on
single businesses, Elders said.
   Elders Chairman John D. Elliott said, ``The reconstruction will
position these companies to continue their growth strongly into the
1990s.''
   Elders IXL will become Fosters Brewing Group Ltd. and focus on
its brewing interests, the announcement said. Its best-known brands
are Fosters and Courage.
   Elders said it would spin off its agribusiness operations by
creating a new publicly held company called Elders Ltd. and giving
Elders' existing shareholders stock in the new company. The spinoff
requires shareholder approval, Elders said.
   Other assets, including Elders IXL's interests in Elders Finance
Group and Elders Resources NZFP, will be sold and the surplus cash
will be distributed to shareholders over time, it said.
   Harlin Holdings Pty Ltd., an Australian company that owns 55
percent of Elders' stock and supports the restructuring, said it
plans to reduce its interest in Fosters Brewing to below 50 percent
and maintain its stake between 40 percent and 50 percent.
   Harlin will scale down its holding in the agribusiness company
as well, Elders said, without providing specifics, and will retain
representatives on the two boards of directors.
   Elders said it has reached ``an understanding'' with Grand Met,
the British food, liquor and leisure group that owns Pillsbury Co.
of the United States, to acquire Grand Met's four breweries.
   The 50-50 venture to operate pubs will be called Inntrepreneur
Estates Ltd. and will operate Elders' more than 5,000 pubs and
Grand Met's more than 2,000 pubs.
   Elders said it intends to make a definitive announcement on the
brewery purchase and pub joint venture shortly. It did not say how
much it would pay for Grand Met's brewing interests, but it said
the purchase and the combination of the pubs would offset each
other. ``The two transactions would be cash neutral,'' it said.
   The deal with Grand Met requires approval from British
regulatory authorities and of Grand Met's shareholders, Elders said.
   Last year, the government blocked Elders' hostile bid of 1.6
billion pounds, or $2.6 billion, for the British brewer Scottish
and Newcastle PLC for competitive reasons.
   Britain's brewers have been seeking to restructure their
operations since the government, in an effort to encourage
competition, decided that brewers' could own only 2,000 ``tied''
pubs which sell the owners' beers. Any pubs owned above that number
have to be ``free'' houses selling whatever beer they like.
   Explaining the restructuring, Elders said its board of directors
decided that Elders' market value does not reflect the value of its
brewing operations and that the way to rectify that was to create a
separate brewing company which was likely to be more attractive to
shareholders.
   The restructuring has been ``a longstanding objective,'' it said.
   Fosters Brewing will have strong competitive positions in
Australia, Canada and Britain, and significant potential for future
growth, Elders said.
   Before the Grand Met deal, Fosters Brewing would be the
fourth-largest brewing company in the world, the company said.
   Among other things, the agribusiness company will be a leading
provider of farm services in Australaia, the largest wool broker,
largest livestock sales and rural merchandise supply organization
and a major provider of financial services to the rural industry.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew C. Hove Jr., a small town Nebraska
banker and Republican activist, is the leading candidate to fill a
vacancy on the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He was recommended for the job by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., said Thursday. President Bush
is expected to make the appointment. The post requires Senate
confirmation.
   The FDIC insures deposits in both banks and savings
institutions. Its board supervises the Resolution Trust Corp., a
new agency created in August to carry out President Bush's savings
and loan bailout.
   The White House also received Brady's nominee for director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates solvent S&amp;Ls,
said an administration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity
and would not reveal the name of the person recommended.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary Salvatore R. Martoche has been
serving as acting director since Tuesday, replacing M. Danny Wall,
who resigned three months ago under fire from Congress.
   However, savings institutions in danger of failure have
challenged Martoche's legal authority and the administration, which
until recently had been unable to find a candidate, wants to move
swiftly to appoint a permanent director.
   Hove, 55, is viewed as a representative of small town and farm
banks. He served as mayor of Minden from 1974 to 1982 and is a
political supporter of Smith and Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska.
   Banking's two principal trade groups, the American Bankers
Association and the Independent Bankers Association of America back
him.
   The appointment would be a victory for FDIC Chairman L. William
Seidman, who at times has been at odds with the Treasury Department
over the conduct of the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``I think he's a fine appointment. We'll be very pleased to have
him on this board if the president appoints him,'' Seidman said.
   There had been speculation among industry insiders that Treasury
would use the appointment to gain control of the FDIC board. Two
Treasury officials, the thrift office director and the comptroller
of the currency, hold seats on the five-member board. Since
October, Seidman publicly campaigned for the appointment of an
``independent banker'' to his board.
   ``This appointment looks potentially to signal a new era of good
feeling and a closer working relationship between the FDIC and
Treasury,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of
the independent bankers.
   ``I think it underscores a new recognition (by Treasury) ...
that you should have people other than Wall Street types in top
positions of the government,'' Guenther said.
   Hove is chairman and chief executive of the Minden Exchange Bank
&amp; Trust Co., Minden, Neb. A former aircraft carrier pilot, he
steered his bank through the farm depression of the early 1980s and
served as president of the Nebraska Bankers Association.
   His appointment also likely would be viewed as win for small
banks, who are fighting suggestions within the administration to
scale back federal deposit insurance.

<HEAD>Gradual Switch to Private Banking System to Start April 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German and foreign enterprises will be
able to take stakes in private commercial banks when the country
begins switching to a Western-style banking system April 1, central
bank director Horst Kaminsky said Thursday.
   Kaminsky said the plan to switch to a Western system, approved
Thursday by the Cabinet of the Communist-led interim government,
was an important move in making East Germany's economy more
compatible with West Germany's, with an eye toward eventual
currency unification.
   Kaminsky, who spoke at a news conference following the weekly
cabinet meeting, said foreign enterprises would be allowed to
participate in the new banks but gave no details other than that
the transformation would be gradual.
   Since the hard-line Communist leadership of Erich Honecker
collapsed last fall, the government has moved to make East
Germany's centrally-planned economy more compatible with West
Germany's capitalist system, as the countries move toward
unification.
   But East Germany's economy has slowed drastically ahead of the
country's scheduled March 18 free elections, which will seat a new
parliament that could alter any decisions made by the interim
government.
   Kaminsky's proposal includes an autonomous central bank, based
on Western models like West Germany's Bundesbank, that will steer
cash and credit in a mixed commercial banking sector.
   Kaminsky said a series of banks would be released from state
ownership and an independent banking watchdog commission
established.
   The new banks would perform general commercial functions,
similar to West German banks, he said. They would include Deutsche
Kreditbank AG, Genossenschaftsbank Berlin AG, Deutsche
Aussenhandelsbank AG, the East German foreign trade bank that
already operates commercially abroad, and cooperative banks for
trades and crafts.
   Kaminsky said one consequence of the switch would be the
emergence of a capital market and a stock exchange. But he declined
to say whether a bourse could be set up before the end of this year.
   Responding to questions about reports that East Germany's
foreign exchange reserves had dwindled recently from a total of
$1.76 billion to $940 million, Kaminsky said: ``Those rumors about
our currency reserves do not represent the reality.''
   While admitting the uncertainty surrounding East Germany's
future may have unsettled some foreign creditors, he stressed
``there is no cause for panic reports.''

<HEAD>Officials Confirm G-7 To Meet in April</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top finance officials from the world's seven
major industrial countries will meet in Paris early next month to
discuss turbulence in global currency markets and the dramatic
developments in Eastern Europe, officials confirmed Thursday.
   The talks involving the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada were seen as an effort to
strengthen economic coordination at a time of dramatic change in
world affairs.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was instrumental in
scheduling the meeting, insisted that there was no ``special
urgency'' for the gathering, scheduled for April 7.
   However, the discussions will occur just one month before these
same officials are scheduled to meet for a regular economic review
session in conjunction with the spring meeting of the International
Monetary Fund in Washington.
   Currency markets have been especially volatile in recent weeks,
with the West German mark and the Japanese yen falling in value
against the U.S. dollar.
   Analysts said the rising dollar threatened to worsen the huge
American trade deficit by making foreign products less expensive
for U.S. consumers while making American goods more expensive
overseas.
   ``The dollar's strength is of great concern to the
administration,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co. ``It constitutes a recession threat because it is a further
risk to an already beleaguered industrial side of the U.S.
economy.''
   The dollar's advance has occurred despite coordinated
intervention by Federal Reserve and other central banks to push the
currency lower.
   Some analysts suggested that since intervention has proved
largely unsuccessful, G-7 officials might discuss coordinated
changes in interest rates.
   Higher interest rates in Japan and Germany would tend to bolster
those currencies while lower interest rates in the United States
would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
   But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who will attend the
Paris meeting, has opposed further cuts in U.S. interest rates
because of inflationary pressures at home.

<HEAD>Canadian Company in Default on Loans to Two Lenders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., the financially distressed owner
of U.S. department stores operating under bankruptcy-court
supervision, said Thursday it will not pay $5.2 million in interest
due on loans from two major lenders.
   Failure to pay the interest, due Wednesday under special
arrangements made last week postponing earlier payment deadlines,
meant Campeau went into default on loans from Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
   But the lenders have agreed they will not move to collect their
collateral without notifying Campeau nine days in advance.
   The loans total $705 million. Two loans of $75 million and $150
million were made by two subsidiaries of Olympia &amp; York, owned by
the Reichmann family of Toronto. The loan from DeBartolo, a big
Ohio-based shopping mall developer, amounts to $480 million.
   Campeau ``expects to continue discussions with Olympia &amp; York
and DeBartolo regarding the development of a long-term business
plan for the operations of the corporation,'' the company said in a
statement released at its Toronto headquarters.
   Word of the default followed intense discussions with the
lenders late into the evening Wednesday.
   Campeau spokesman Richard W. Wertheim said a deal to defer
payments for several weeks had been worked out Wednesday with
Olympia &amp; York and was contingent on a parallel deal being reached
with DeBartolo. But the DeBartolo talks fell through, he said.
   DeBartolo has claims on Campeau's California-based Ralphs
Grocery Co. chain, but the Ralphs' shares are held by another
Campeau company, Federated Stores Inc., which is under
bankruptcy-court protection in the United States.
   That means DeBartolo would have to line up with other creditors
to seek the approval of a bankruptcy court judge to seize the
Ralphs' assets, Wertheim said.
   The collateral on the Olympia &amp; York loans includes various
properties.
   Neither DeBartolo nor Olympia &amp; York have yet given notice they
intend to seize assets, he added.
   ``Our focus, and their interest as well, is on the long-term
plan for the continued operation of the company,'' Wertheim said,
adding that ``our discussions with all lenders are focused on the
long term, not satisfying something on a day-to-day basis.''
   He said: ``There really is no question that we have the $5.2
million to pay if we wanted to.''
   The Olympia &amp; York and DeBartolo loans were used to help finance
Campeau's ill-fated acquisitions of the U.S. retailing groups
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. in 1986
and 1988. But unlike most of the financing, these loans were
guaranteed by the Toronto-based parent.
   Allied and Federated are currently operating under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, which gives them some time to reorganize
under court direction. When they filed for protection from
creditors on Jan. 15, they listed $7.7 billion in debts.
   It appeared unlikely that the outcome of Campeau's discussions
with Olympia &amp; York and DeBartolo would have any direct bearing on
the Federated and Allied bankruptcy proceedings.
   Wertheim said given the circumstances Campeau has maintained
good relationships with its bank lenders. The inability so far to
reach agreements with Olympia &amp; York and DeBartolo on long-term
loan payment deferrals doesn't imply Campeau's collapse is imminent.
   ``Right now there's no plan for us to fold up our tents,'' he
said.

   Mitsubishi Corp. and managers at Aristech
Chemical Corp. now own 98 percent of the chemical company,
Mitsubishi said Thursday.
   ACC Acquisition Corp., a partnership formed by Aristech
executives and Mitsubishi, paid $859 million, or $27 a share, for
31.8 million shares of Aristech, officials said.
   Management at Aristech won't change, Mitsubishi spokesman Peter
Rosenthal said. The Japanese company owns 80 percent of ACC
Acquisition, he said.
   Aristech's board rejected a $25 a share offer from Utah
industrialist John Huntsman last fall.
   Aristech posted earnings of $15.1 million, or 43 cents per
share, on sales of $222.6 million during the last quarter of 1989.
In all of 1989, the company earned $82.1 million, or $2.36 per
share, on sales of $996.4 million.
   Aristech, a maker of thermoplastic resins, employs 1,800 people
at 10 plants in eight states. Its management bought the company
from steel and energy giant USX Corp. in 1986.
   Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall led the management side of the
current buyout.

   Oil prices sagged Thursday for a third straight
session amid selling associated with bearish supply and demand
expectations.
   Energy market analysts said earlier weakness in Asia and Europe
set a negative tone on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
key grade of U.S. crude oil, shed 15 cents to close at $20.78 per
42-gallon barrel after losing 65 cents on Wednesday and Tuesday.
Contracts for delivery during May through July finished lower by 16
cents to 18 cents.
   The April contract of No. 2 home heating oil dropped 0.85 cent
to 55.34 cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's and Tuesday's losses
of 1.03 cents and 0.77 cent, respectively. Contracts for delivery
further in the future also declined but more moderately.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, the April contract of unleaded regular gasoline fell 0.59
cent to 56.14 cents a gallon, bringing its decline over the past
three sessions to 3.16 cents. Contracts for delivery during May
through July also declined, with the May contract off 0.88 cent.
   Randall Rothenberg, a broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
selling momentum overseas carried over into U.S. trading. Traders
sold on the assumption that supplies currently are adequate to meet
demand.
   The reopening of a major New York harbor waterway might have
dampened buying enthusiasm to some extent, he said. The waterway
was temporarily closed after a barge loaded with heating oil
exploded and caught fire earlier in the week, the third oil-related
mishap in the area this year.

   Northwest Airlines plans to give away more
free-flight coupons in hopes of appeasing passengers bumped on
oversold flights.
   In the first three months of this year, the airline will reduce
its rate of involuntary-denied boardings by 60 percent compared
with a year earlier, Robert Fornaro, Northwest's vice president of
marketing planning, said Wednesday. Involuntary-denied boardings
are the bumping of passengers who don't want to get off planes.
   In the fourth quarter of last year, Northwest involuntarily
bumped about 2,200 passengers, or 2.53 for every 10,000 passengers
boarded.
   Northwest has been steadily improving by that measure since the
problem peaked last summer, the airline says. In the fourth quarter
of 1989, it bumped about 2,500 fewer people than in the same
quarter a year earlier, and the bumpings were reduced even though
total passenger boardings rose 12 percent.
   Northwest's 1989 rate of involuntary bumpings was 3.83 per
10,000 passengers boarded, down from 4.26 in 1988, said Northwest
spokesman Doug Miller.
   The airline also showed progress in the fourth quarter in the
number of people who are bumped ``voluntarily''. That means they
take a later flight because the carrier offers them incentives such
as cash or coupons for free flights in the future.
   ``It costs us a few more free tickets, but that's the price you
pay,'' Fornaro said.
   Most major airlines aim to hold overbooking to a minimum, in an
effort to reduce both voluntary and involuntary bumping. But when a
flight is overbooked, they want to convert as many travelers as
possible to the voluntary side by offering them the freebies.
   Northwest offers freebies to bumped passengers now, but it
hasn't offered enough to entice larger numbers of fliers to give up
their seats voluntarily.
   Fornaro said it is especially difficult for Northwest to cut its
number of involuntary bumpings because it has large numbers of
passengers on long flights over the Pacific. Passengers on longer
flights are generally less flexible in their plans than those on
shorter hauls.
   Many travelers, especially business fliers, reserve seats on
several flights to ensure they will have their choice of departure
times.
   That forces airlines to book more reservations than they have
seats, or risk having lots of empty seats.

<HEAD>Stock Of Two Companies Making AIDS Vaccine Bolstered By Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two small biotechnology companies that have
devised an AIDS vaccine have seen their stock shoot higher
following an official go-ahead for human testing of the substance.
   Stock in Alpha 1 Biomedicals Inc. of Washington, D.C., and
Cel-Sci Corp. of Alexandria, Va., jumped after California health
officials approved the first phase of human testing.
   The approval, announced Monday, was the first for human trials
of the HGP-30 vaccine in the United States, according to the
companies.
   Those involved in the tests cautioned it could take years for
the development of a true vaccine.
   Nevertheless, the price of Cel-Sci nearly doubled Tuesday, to
$2.66 from $1.56 Monday, while the price of Alpha 1 shares nearly
tripled that day, to $7.69 from $2.88. Both saw unusually heavy
trading volume.
   The prices of both issues, which are traded on the national
over-the-counter system, eased somewhat Wednesday. By late
afternoon Thursday, Cel-Sci was trading at $2.09 a share and Alpha
1 shares fetched $4.88.
   Cel-Sci and Alpha 1 are 50-50 partners in a joint venture called
Viral Technologies Inc., which devised the vaccine. The vaccine is
synthetic; it contains no live or dead AIDS virus components,
unlike many other AIDS vaccines under study, meaning there is no
chance it could induce infection with the deadly disease.
   Geert Kersten, vice president and treasurer of Cel-Sci, said the
price of his company's stock has been volatile since it went public
in 1983.
   ``It's a very emotional stock,'' he said.
   Kersten owns about 15 percent of the 32 million outstanding
shares, while Cel-Sci's founder, Maximillian de Clara of
Switzerland, owns about 9 percent, Kersten said. Much of the
remaining stock is believed to be held by individual investors, he
said.
   Managers and directors of Alpha 1, which went public in 1986,
own about 15 percent of that company's 4.6 million shares, said
Robert J. Lanham, chief operating officer. The rest is believed to
be held by small investors, he said.
   Both companies have lost money since their founding, which is
typical for biotechnology start-ups.
   Kersten said Viral Technologies began testing the vaccine on
humans in Great Britain last May. So far, the results have been
encouraging, with the immune systems of those in the study
producing the expected defensive response to the AIDS virus, he
said.
   The vaccine targets a core protein of the AIDS virus, which is
found in all strains of the virus. Most other potential vaccines
under study target the outer shell of the virus, which can vary
because the virus often is mutated, Kersten said.
   Several other companies also are testing an AIDS vaccine on
humans, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., a joint venture of
Chiron Corp. and Ciba-Geigy, and a joint venture of Merck &amp; Co. and
Repligen Corp., said Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

<HEAD>K mart Posts $20.5 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Retail Sales, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. on Thursday blamed costs of an
accelerated five-year plan to build new stores and renovate older
ones for a $20.5 million loss in its fourth quarter.
   Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said recently that costs of speeding
up the $2.3-billion expansion and renovation program, now scheduled
for completion in 1994, would cut into profits at the nation's
second-largest retailer.
   He said Thursday that price-cutting and completing the expansion
program were essential to keeping competitors at bay. ``We
anticipate sales and earnings in future years will benefit
significantly from the acceleration of this program,'' Antonini
said.
   But analysts suggested the retailer is feeling pressure. ``I
think they feel that we're going to lose confidence quickly if they
don't make some kind of dramatic move,'' said analyst Sally Schaadt
at New York-based Fourteen Research.
   K mart said its results translated to a loss of 10 cents a share
for quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with a net profit of $393.2
million, or $1.96 a share in the year-ago quarter.
   Revenue for the period totaled $9.75 billion, up 16 percent from
$8.42 billion the year before.
   The company took an after-tax charge of $416.1 million during
the quarter to cover the restructuring program, said spokesman
Orren F. Knauer. Without the charge, K mart said fourth-quarter
earnings would have been $395.6 million, or $1.97 a share.
   For the fiscal year, profits fell 60 percent to $322.7 million,
or $1.61 a share, from $802.9, or $4 a share. Revenue was up 8
percent at $29.53 billion, compared with year-earlier revenue of
$27.3 billion.
   The figures included a $422.5 million after-tax charge in
connection with the construction and renovation program.
   K mart is the nation's largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co., but No. 3 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has surpassed K mart in
profits, recently reporting $1.1 billion in 1989 earnings on sales
of $25.8 billion.
   ``We have already opened several prototype stores and have
enlarged and relocated many of our stores,'' Antonini said.
``Customer acceptance of the layouts, fixturing and new merchandise
assortments has been very good and sales results have exceeded
expectations.''
   K mart also said Thursday its February sales were up 14.7
percent from February 1989, and sales on a comparable store basis _
for stores open at least one year _ were up 4.4 percent.
   Antonini said the increase included strong gains in clothing
lines.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher in Quiet U.S. Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly higher Thursday in
extremely quiet domestic trading as investors spent the day on the
sidelines wary of provoking the central banks to intervene.
   Gold prices slipped in New York after finishing mixed overseas.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $400 a troy
ounce, off 20 cents from Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New
York later quoted a bid of $399.80 a troy ounce, down 80 cents.
   Currency trading was lackluster worldwide. ``The day never
really got started,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader with the
Bank of Boston in New York. ``It was almost like a holiday market.''
   Traders said only one factor dampened activity _ the threat of
central bank intervention. Dealers were surprised on Wednesday when
a group of central banks aggressively and repeatedly sold dollars
to keep the currency from rising.
   The Federal Reserve was believed to have entered the market more
than once Thursday to sell dollars against the Japanese yen, but
the action was modest compared with the previous session, traders
said.
   Still, sentiment toward the U.S. currency remains very bullish.
   ``More and more people are seeing that the economy is not doing
as badly as original expectations, so there should be no real
easing of interest rates,'' Morrissey said.
   Higher interest rates generally support the dollar by enhancing
the value of fixed-income securities. Foreign investors, typically
major purchasers of instruments like U.S government bonds, need
dollars to make their investments.
   Further evidence of the strength of the U.S. economy will come
on Friday, when the Labor Department issues its unemployment report
for February. The consensus is for non-farm payrolls to show an
increase of about 240,000 jobs.
   Separately, officials confirmed that finance ministers from the
Group of Seven leading industrialized countries will meet in early
April in Paris, where they are expected to discuss global currency
exchange rates.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.83 Japanese yen, up
from 150.75. Later in London, the dollar closed at 150.80 yen. But
in New York, the dollar finished at 151.09 yen, up from 150.35 yen
on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6427 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6388. But the dollar
gained against the British currency in New York, where one pound
cost $1.6385, cheaper than $1.6465 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.7008 West German marks, up from 1.6982;
1.5080 Swiss francs, up from 1.4995; 5.7495 French francs, up from
5.7400; 1,255.25 Italian lire, up from 1,252.75, and 1.1807
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1831.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.7015 West German marks, down from 1.7075;
1.5080 Swiss francs, up from 1.5075; 5.7525 French francs, down
from 5.7665; 1.9164 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9155; 1,255.75
Italian lire, down from 1,259.00, and 1.1792 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1853.
   Gold closed in London at $401.95 bid a troy ounce, up from
$399.25. The closing Zurich bid price was unchanged at $400.75.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $401.95 bid, down from $402.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.112 a troy ounce, down from
$5.122 on Wednesday. In London the metal traded at a bid price of
$5.15 a troy ounce, up from $5.13.

<HEAD>Casting Call: Businessmen Played By Hollywood's Howard, Grazer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imagine a child TV star turned successful movie
director, starting a company with a savvy Hollywood producer who
takes credit for helping launch the careers of Michael Keaton,
Darryl Hannah and Tom Hanks.
   Add a splash of comic instinct, a public stock offering that
raises $81 million, distribution deals with a major film studio and
a cable TV network.
   The result is Imagine Films Entertainment Inc., an independent
production company created and co-chaired by director Ron Howard
and producer Brian Grazer.
   Imagine was launched as a public company in July 1986 and seems
to be entering the 1990s on a steady footing _ at a time when some
independents in the field are struggling.
   Imagine's stock, traded in the over-the-counter market, has been
fetching $14.50 a share recently, up from around $10.50 a year ago
and a low of $2 after the market collapse in October 1987. The
company started to turn a profit last September.
   ``We've been incredibly lucky,'' Grazer said in a recent
interview of him and partner Howard, a longtime friend. ``We raised
money from the public on no assets.''
   Well, not exactly. Howard and Grazer are helping prove that
talent can be packaged into a marketable security on Wall Street.
   ``There's a very real strength,'' said Christopher Dixon, an
analyst who follows the entertainment industry for Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co. ``It's a group of hands-on producers and directors who know
their industry.''
   Howard, 35, has directed hit comedy films including ``Night
Shift,'' ``Splash,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``Parenthood''. But he is
probably best known to a generation of TV-weaned baby boomers as
cute little Opie on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' and later as
all-American teenager Richie Cunningham on ``Happy Days.''
   ``I tend to be a bit ponderous, a bit deliberate about what I'm
trying to do, where I'm going,'' Howard said. ``Sometimes you can
stall out from that approach. ... Brian has great instincts. He's a
great self-starter.''
   Howard, who began his acting career at age 18 months, still
projects the same boy-next-door wholesomeness he had on screen,
though his ginger hair is thinning and his suit is conservative.
Big-time success, and his forays into Wall Street, don't seem to
have jaded him.
   Grazer, 38, has the same ebullience. He started his career
developing TV projects, moving into a producing deal with Paramount
Pictures in 1980. He admits that in the early days, many doors
slammed on him and his zany ideas.
   Now, the two entrepreneurs make it look easy.
   ``It's not that tough,'' Grazer replied when asked about the
duo's encounters with investment bankers and other financial
operatives. ``They're fascinated with the way we work.''
   Imagine's business plan, they tell financiers, avoids risk. The
Los Angeles-based company aims to produce mainstream commercial
films with ``high visibility, high quality and broad appeal.''
   Most importantly, Imagine has signed a deal with Universal
Pictures for Universal to distribute as many as 20 films produced
by Imagine and an agreement with Showtime-The Movie Channel for TV
rights for up to 30 movies that would run in theaters first.
   In addition MCA Inc., Universal's parent, has invested $10
million in Imagine securities, which give MCA the right to convert
into a 24.8 percent share of the company. Howard and Grazer each
own 17.6 percent of Imagine's shares.
   The deals with Universal and Showtime, a cable TV network owned
by Viacom International Inc., are designed to give Howard and
Grazer extensive outlets for marketing their work without impinging
on their creative control.
   Both speak passionately about Imagine, finishing each other's
sentences in rapid cadence. Both see Hollywood analogies
everywhere, including a recent meeting they had with Wall Street
financiers.
   ``It was just like something out of `Trading Places,' Grazer
said, referring to the Eddie Murphy-Dan Aykroyd spoof of commodity
futures trading.
   Don't assume Howard is responsible for the creative side of the
company and Grazer only takes care of business. It was Grazer, for
example, who came up with the concept for ``Splash'': an innocent
mermaid who comes ashore in New York.
   So far, Imagine has produced ``The Burbs'' starring Tom Hanks,
``The Dream Team'' with Michael Keaton, and ``Parenthood,''
starring Steve Martin and directed by Howard. All three were
released last year. ``Parenthood,'' the most popular and profitable
of the trio, grossed an estimated $96 million.
   A newer project is ``Cry Baby,'' described as a 1950s musical,
starring Johnny Depp of TV's ``21 Jump Street,'' due to be released
in early April. ``Opportunity Knocks'' is scheduled for release at
the end of March and ``Problem Child'' is due later this spring.
   In the fall, NBC plans to launch a weekly TV series based on
``Parenthood,'' produced by Imagine and Universal.
   In George Lucas's 1973 film ``American Graffiti,'' Howard plays
a high school senior in the throes of self-discovery. Hassled by a
nitpicking male teacher at a school dance, he snaps, ``Why don't
you go kiss a duck or something.''
   With Imagine, Howard seems to have told the conventional
moviemaking establishment to do the same. But this time he's hedged
his recklessness by buttressing the company with solid financial
backing.

   Here is a brief look at the major elements of
the Bush administration's national transportation policy released
Thursday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EXPANSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The policy would preserve and maintain existing roads, highways,
airports, railroad lines, waterways and other transportation
facilities and focus on moving people and goods, not simply
vehicles, in planning new systems. Expansion would be accomplished
in partnership with state and local governments and private
investors, with federal programs focusing on projects of ``national
significance.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The federal government would rely more heavily on user fees to
finance its share and give state and local governments more
authority to raise their own revenue through toll roads, local gas
taxes, airport passenger taxes and other fees. User fees are also
proposed for Coast Guard services and railroad safety activities of
the government.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMPETITION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government would encourage competition by continuing to
remove regulations, including federal requirements on truck rates
and services and on liability procedures affecting the railroad
industry. The Transportation Department also would review federal
maritime programs and pursue international negotiations to help
U.S. shipping lines compete in world markets.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAFETY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government will launch a campaign to reduce highway traffic
fatalities and will continue to address concerns about hazardous
materials shipments, aging airliners, transportation vehicle design
and the distribution and use of illegal drugs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The policy recognizes the need for more fuel-efficient vehicles,
the implications of global climate changes and the problems
associated with aircraft noise, but it recommends no specific
action.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TECHNOLOGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The federal government would provide some money to encourage
research by private companies and educational institutions into
magnetically levitated trains, alternative power sources for cars,
hypersonic planes, computerized vehicles and roads and other
innovations.

   The stock market climbed to an eight-week high
Thursday, resuming its late-winter rally as Wall Street looked
ahead to Friday's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 26.58 points to
2,696.17, its highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   Over the last 11 sessions the average sports a gain of just
under 132 points, or 5.1 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
983 up, 507 down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.90 million
shares, up from 163.58 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 204.35 million shares.
   The Labor Department's report on employment Friday morning
promises to give investors one of the first signposts of the
economy's performance in February.
   Hopes apparently spread for fresh evidence from the figures that
business activity was continuing to expand at a sluggish but
presumably sustainable pace.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of
perhaps 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, not far below a
275,000 rise posted for January.
   If consensus projections are accurate, the report will also put
the civilian unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, unchanged from the
month before.
   Hilton Hotels led the active list, down 10&rsqb; at 50|. The company
ended its quest for an acquirer, saying it hadn't attracted the
kind of bids it had hoped for because of adverse financial
circumstances.
   C.R. Bard, which recalled two catheter products, fell 3&lsqb; to 13|.
   Compaq Computer, up 3| at 95~, and Businessland, up \ at 11,
were strong for the second straight session following news of an
agreement for Businessland to resume carrying Compaq products.
   USX rose 1 to 36|. Carl Icahn, the financier who owns a big
chunk of USX stock, is pressing a plan to spin off at least an 80

Business Machines, up 1{ at 107, and Coca-Cola, up 1 at 72&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $28.01 billion, or
0.86 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.58 to 187.35.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.00 to 393.02, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.32 at 340.27.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Feb. 26, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,264.8 billion from a revised $3,256.5 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,072.9 billion from a revised $4,069.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $804.9 billion from a revised $800.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.2 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,235.0 billion, a 6.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,051.5 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1
rose 5.0 percent to an average of $796.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $115 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$136 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $301.0 billion in the two-week period ended
March 7, up from $300.6 billion two weeks earlier.

   Assets of the nation's 499 money market mutual
funds rose $2 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $390.79 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed revised drop of $1.9 billion in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets surpassed the previous record high of $390.69
billion set in the week ended Feb. 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 245 general purpose funds increased $505.2 million to
$132.9 billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds rose $1.29
billion to $166.14 billion, and assets of 153 institutional funds
rose $212 million to $91.75 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.92 percent from 7.94 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.64 percent from 7.65 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, down from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.26 percent as of Wednesday from 6.27 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.06 percent from 5.07 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.86
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.87 the
previous week. Yields were 7.96 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.94 percent; 7.95 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.96 percent;
and 8.01 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.00 percent.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-sharing checks averaging $1,025
each were distributed Thursday to Ford Motor Co. hourly employees,
in the largest such payout this year by the Big Three automakers.
   Ford's $166 million in profit-sharing payments to hourly and
salaried employees tops the $22.2 million, or about $50 to each of
443,000 workers, in profit-sharing that General Motors Corp. will
distribute next week.
   Ford declined to give the amount of the average salaried
profit-sharing check or to say precisely how many of the 150,891
eligible employees were hourly or salaried.
   Chrysler Corp.'s 1989 earnings of $359 million, were not enough
to trigger profit-sharing provisions.
   Payments were about $2,800 last year for Ford employees, $254
for GM workers and averaged about $700 at Chrysler.
   Profit-sharing payments are based on each company's
previous-year earnings from its North American operations.
   Combined Big Three profit-sharing payments this year amounted to
about $188.2 million, or about 69 percent less than the $604.1
million the companies handed out last year.
   Total Big Three profits in 1989 fell 24.9 percent from the
previous year to $8.42 billion, due to increasing competition from
Japanese automakers, costs of buyer incentives and slowing sales.

<HEAD>Pork Prices Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock and meat prices surged Thursday for the third
consecutive session at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid
concerns about tight hog supplies.
   On other futures markets, grains rallied, but gold, energy
products and orange juice contracts all declined.
   At the Chicago Merc, the frozen pork bellies contract for
delivery in March rose the daily limit of 2 cents after four
contracts posted the maximum increases allowed in the previous
session.
   ``The market is reflecting an insufficent supply of hogs to
satisfy packer needs,'' said Chuck Levitt, an analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Packers simply don't have the hogs they need,
and the consumer and investor are paying more.''
   The advance in cattle prices ``was mainly a spillover from the
strong pork complex,'' he said.
   Cattle settled .30 cent to .70 cent higher, with the contract
for delivery in April at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.25 cent to .85 cent higher, with March at 81.87 cents a pound;
live hogs were .05 cent to .65 cent higher, with April at 52.07
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .37 cent to 2.00 cents
higher, with March at 50.95 cents a pound.
   Frozen orange juice futures fell on the New York Cotton Exchange
in one of the few down days since the December freeze in Florida.
   Shearson's Judy Ganes blamed the drop on profit-taking.
   She also said that a Florida growers' report, originally thought
by traders to be 3 million boxes shy of the U.S. Agriculture
Department estimate last month, left some traders Wednesday with
the wrong impression.
   The growers' figure didn't include 3 million navel oranges and
gift fruit, but matched the USDA's estimate in other areas, she
explained.
   Frozen concentrate orange juice settled .10 cent to 1.00 cent
lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $1.90 a pound.
   Soybean and grain futures finished higher after opening slightly
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Purchases by Iraqi investors in the soymeal cash market and
rumors of Chinese interest in soyoil helped push soybean prices
higher, said analyst Mark Weidner of Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   Wheat staged a late rally on news of China's bid for 400,000
metric tons of U.S. export bonus wheat, and corn followed suit,
traders said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3{ cents higher, with the contract for
March at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents higher, with
March at $2.42} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher,
with March at $1.45} a bushel; and soybeans were 4 cents to 7 cents
higher, with March at $5.81{ a bushel.
   Oil prices sagged for a third straight session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Randall Rothenberg, an energy market analyst from Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said selling momentum overseas carried over into
U.S. trading.
   Crude oil settled 11 cents to 18 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at $20.78 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent
to .85 cent lower, with April at 55.34 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .25 cent to .88 cent lower, with April at 56.14 cents
a gallon.
   A stronger U.S. dollar sent gold and silver futures lower on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 50 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $400 a troy ounce; while silver was 1 cent to
1.2 cents lower, with March at $5.11.

   The Federal Communications Commission, taking
another big step towards a deregulated interstate long-distance
phone business, proposed Thursday to loosen rules on AT&amp;T because
the onetime monopoly company now faces ``significant competition.''
   The commission, in a 4-0 vote, adopted a staff proposal that, if
finally approved, would give the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
the freedom it says it needs to maneuver against some 500
long-distance companies in the $55 billion long-distance
marketplace.
   The commission said it would study competition in the interstate
long-distance arena and adopt necessary regulatory reforms. But it
tentatively concluded ``interstate services as a whole are now
subject to significant competition and that competition in the
provision of business services is particularly vigorous'' _ a key
finding that must be made to deregulate AT&amp;T.
   Based on those conclusions, the commission proposed a phased-in
package of changes in certain business services, extending later to
800-number services, international calling and operator services.
   The commission decided not to propose any changes to residential
and small business services at this time.
   The proposals are a victory for AT&amp;T, which the FCC formally
declared in 1981 as a ``dominant'' carrier that should be subject
to regulation to prevent abuses to competitors or customers. AT&amp;T
won another victory last year when the FCC dumped its 20-year-old
rate-of-return regulation of AT&amp;T's profits in exchange for a
system that controls AT&amp;T's prices within certain limits tied to
the rate of inflation.
   AT&amp;T has argued that it no longer is dominant and that it has
lost $10 billion in business to competitors since the 1984 breakup
of the old Bell System. Prices have fallen 40 percent and its share
of the long-distance market has dropped below 70 percent. MCI now
has about 12 percent of the business, US Sprint about 9 percent,
and the rest is scattered among hundreds of smaller companies.
   AT&amp;T's arguments apparently fell on fertile ground at an FCC
under new Chairman Alfred Sikes, who believes there is too much
government intervention in the phone business.
   ``The changes in market shares reflect the fact that competition
has worked,'' Sikes said Thursday.
   Sikes also said earlier this year the FCC would drop
rate-of-return regulation on the interstate revenues of local
telephone companies in 1991, and the commission issued proposed
guidelines Thursday for this new price cap regime.
   Besides capping prices, the plan also would require the local
phone companies to share any earnings above a certain level with
customers.
   AT&amp;T applauded the proposals for long-distance carriers, saying
the commission ``took a major step toward shaping policies based
not on outdated orthodoxy but on future flexibility. ... The FCC's
proposal validates AT&amp;T's premise that everyone gains when all
competitors are free to anticipate and meet customer needs.''
   Competitors were less pleased, with MCI saying that while it too
welcomed the FCC inquiry, the FCC ``clearly recognizes'' that
``AT&amp;T can leverage its dominance to abuse'' competitors.
   Sprint said it was ``generally pleased'' with the FCC's approach
and that the FCC was ``appropriately'' moving towards deregulation
where rules no longer are needed.
   Under current regulations, AT&amp;T must make a public filing with
the FCC each time it proposes to offer a new service or change the
terms and conditions under which it offers any service already
sanctioned by the FCC.
   AT&amp;T says the public disclosure of its offerings and the length
of time it takes to get FCC approval puts it at a disadvantage in
today's fast-moving telecommunications marketplace.
   The FCC apparently agreed, proposing a ``streamlined'' filing
process that would allow AT&amp;T to give one day's notice for certain
business services without submitting the cost data now required.
AT&amp;T also would be freed of some provisions of the new ``price
cap'' regime the FCC imposed last year.
   The FCC also proposed that AT&amp;T be permitted to offer certain
business services to individual customers, as long as they file
contracts and summaries of their provisions within 30 days of the
effective date of the contract.
   The commission also proposed that all long-distance carriers be
permitted to withdraw some of their facilities from the public
phone network for use by private businesses.
   The commission will ask public comment on its proposals, and the
opposition is expected to be strong from those who say AT&amp;T still
has enormous market power _ and is likely to gain even more clout
if it is deregulated.

<HEAD>On Capitol Hill: Experts Debate, Debunk Junk Bonds</HEAD>

   Witnesses at a congressional hearing on junk
bonds warned Thursday that defaults in the high-risk securities
were likely to grow, but did not necessarily think Congress should
act to restrict them.
   Representatives from the bond rating agencies, Moody's Investors
Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. were among those testifying
about the future and possible dangers of junk bonds before a
subcommittee of the House Energy and Committee.
   ``A junk bond is a shaky debt. It is the promise to pay of a
debtor who is just getting by,'' said James Grant, editor of the
newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   Bonds are, in effect, corporate promises to pay back borrowed
money at a later date while paying a regular, fixed interest. Junk
bonds, however, are ``non-investment grade,'' meaning that rating
services like S&amp;P or Moody's give them a greater chance of default
than more stable investment grade bonds. To compensate, they pay a
much higher interest yield.
   Pioneered by financier Michael Milken at the firm of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., junk bonds helped a number of small or
fledgling companies expand while also assisting corporate raiders
in financing huge corporate takeovers with little up-front cash.
   But the $200 billion junk bond market has been rocked repeatedly
in recent months by Milken's indictment on racketeering charges,
defaults by corporate junk borrowers, the withdrawal of many
savings and loan institutions as buyers of the securities and the
bankruptcy filing by Drexel's parent company.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said
there were questions about whether plunging prices in the junk
market and the collapse of Drexel had endangered the long-term
health of U.S. companies that rely on high-yield financing.
   ``The risks of the junk bond market have been exaggerated by the
press,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist with
DRI-McGraw-Hill, adding that Drexel's demise ``is a symptom of the
problems in the market more than a cause of new problems.''
   Thomas J. McGuire, director of Moody's Corporate Department,
said the default rate for speculative-grade bonds, which includes
junk bonds, has risen to 5.4 percent, the second-highest rate since
1970.
   ``And the outlook _ given the increase in lower rated issuers
and the potentially unfavorable economic environment _ is for still
higher levels of defaults in the early 1990s,'' McGuire said.
   Mark Bachman, senior vice president of S&amp;P's Corporate Finance
Department, said current problems in the junk bond market ``are by
no means inherent in the nature of all non-investment grade bonds,
but rather stem from the excess of financial leverage that came to
characterize'' junk bonds issuers in the late 1980s.
   Both Grant and Wyss cautioned against trying to correct the junk
bond market through legislation.
   ``I would advise the subcommittee to be wary of pushing the
market toward even greater stringency,'' said Grant.
   ``Legislation is more likely to worsen than help the problem,''
said Wyss. ``Leverage is a response to the incentives in the tax
law, and unless those incentives change, attacking the symptoms
will just cause problems elsewhere.''

<HEAD>Aquarium Light Cords Recalled Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A discount and variety retailer said Wednesday
that it is recalling 39,000 aquarium light cords for a second time
because consumers have not responded to the initial effort.
   McCrory Corp. said it recalled the electric light cord assembly
part of its Aqua Hex Aquariums last summer because ``the wires may
short circuit and ignite the cord.''
   Spokeswoman Joy Shepp said the company then advertised the
recall for seven days in January in USA Today.
   ``Consumers are paying no attention to this recall,'' Shepp
said. ``We're doing our best to warn consumers and comply with
Consumer Product Safety Commission concerns, but we're not having a
good consumer reply.''
   Shepp said the company had sent only 250 replacement cords as a
result of the first recall.
   The cords were sold nationwide between July 1988 and February
1989 by Bargain Time, Britts, Elmore, McCrory, H.L. Green, Kress,
McClellan, T.G. &amp; Y, Silver Kittinger and Newberry stores. The fish
tank also was sold by some independent variety stores, the company
said.
   The company said in a statement that it was aware of three
incidents in which the cord short-circuited or caught fire. No
injuries have been reported, it said.
   Consumers should detach the defective light cord from the
aquarium hood and return it, without the bulb, for a replacement
from the store where it was purchased or contact McCrory Stores at
1-800-284-3704.
