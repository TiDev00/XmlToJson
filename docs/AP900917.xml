<HEAD>Murdered Tourist's Family: `Police Can't Do It Alone'</HEAD>

   The mother of aslain Utah tourist testified
Monday that civilians, not police, came to the family's rescue
while her son lay fatally stabbed in a Manhattan subway station.
   The family of mugging victim Brian Watkins returned to New York
from Provo, Utah, for the first time since the Sept. 2 murder to
testify before the U.S. Senate Transportation Appropriations
Subcommittee, which is exploring ways to pay for improved subway
safety.
   Karen Watkins, her voice strong and unwavering, recalled what
happened after a gang of muggers attacked the family and stabbed
her son Brian, 22.
   ``I had asked the token booth clerk to call 911. He just ignored
me. So I ran outside. There were two pay phones out there that were
being used at the time by two gentlemen. And I asked them to call
911.''
   A man told her there was another phone on the train platform. He
ran downstairs with her, jumped the turnstile and opened an exit
door so she could bypass the turnstile and get onto the platform to
call 911.
   Mrs. Watkins said the token booth clerk ``never said a word to
me at all. My son was lying not more than 5 feet from him. But he
did not respond.''
   The Transit Authority has disputed this account, saying the
clerk used an emergency phone in his booth to summon police and
paramedics.
   Brian's brother, Todd, testified that it took about 10 minutes
for official help to arrive after the 911 call.
   Watkins, a former high school tennis star, was on an annual trip
to the U.S. Open tennis tournament with his brother, mother, father
and sister-in-law.
   They were attacked at a station in midtown Manhattan at around
10:30 p.m.
   A group of youths set upon Watkins' father, Sherwin, slashing
his pants with a knife and stealing a money clip containing about
$200 in cash and some credit cards. Brian and Todd interceded when
Mrs. Watkins was punched in the face.
   Brian was stabbed in the chest. He collapsed while chasing the
suspects and died 40 minutes later at a hospital.
   ``I don't think there was anything that really alerted us'' to
the imminent danger, Mrs. Watkins said.
   ``Maybe, looking back, we should have been a little more careful
as we watched these young boys run into the subway and not pay the
toll. ... We just thought they didn't want to pay the fare and were
running to catch the train.''
   Eight suspects have been charged with second-degree murder in
Watkins' killing.
   Todd Watkins read a statement on the family's behalf that said:
``The death of Brian Watkins has shocked the city of New York. It
has made New Yorkers realize that there is no safe place in the
city and that crime is rampant.''
   The one-day hearing was held by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
and Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for D'Amato, said the senator's
office invited the Watkinses to testify. She said an airline
donated airfare and a hotel donated accommodations.

<HEAD>Study Throws More Dirt on Lawn Darts</HEAD>

   Scores of children are hurt each year by lawn
darts despite a ban on the dangerous toys that have killed and
maimed, a study found.
   ``I want people across the country to simply throw these things
way,'' said Dr. Sara Sotiropoulos, who led researchers at The
Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``Even though the sale of these has been banned ... there (are)
supposedly 10 million sets of these in garages'' across the
country, Ms. Sotiropoulos said Monday in a telephone interview.
   Lawn darts were designed for use outside in a game played like
horseshoes. They have heavy, pointed tips.
   ``They're just too dangerous,'' said Ms. Sotiropoulos, now
practicing pediatrics in Bellingham, Wash.
   In the study, published in the September issue of the American
Journal of Diseases of Children, Ms. Sotiropoulos and colleagues
examined data on 76 children injured by the darts from 1973 to
1988.
   Three of those children were killed by the darts, and more than
half suffered serious head injuries, such as skull fractures and
brain lesions, she said.
   Congress and the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned lawn
darts in the fall of 1988. Until the ban, lawn dart injuries were
responsible for an estimated 675 emergency room visits a year,
according to the CPSC.
   In 1989, after the ban, an estimated 439 such visits were blamed
on the darts, department statistics show.
   The study examined data on children aged 19 months to 18 years,
including 69 cases reported by the CPSC. Of those, 49 percent were
hospitalized and 13 percent suffered lasting damage such as
blindness or brain damage.
   The six additional children studied all suffered serious head
injuries. They included a 7-year-old boy injured when a thrown dart
pierced his cheek and entered his brain, Ms. Sotiropoulos said.
   The boy, who was admitted to the Kansas City hospital,
contracted meningitis because of the injury and remains in a coma
nearly two years after he was injured, she said.
   ``Pediatricians should educate parents about this hazard and
encourage them to discard all lawn darts,'' the study said.
   The darts were manufactured by several companies, which are
prohibited from making the devices under the 1988 ban, said CPSC
spokesman Ken Giles.

<HEAD>Computer Expert Sentenced To Life For Masterminding Wife's Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer entrepreneur described by a
judge as ``a master manipulator'' was sentenced Monday to life in
prison for persuading his teen-age daughter to kill his wife.
   David Arnold Brown, 38, displayed no emotion as Superior Court
Judge Donald A. McCartin told the affluent businessman his sentence
left no possibility of parole.
   Prosecutors convinced jurors that Brown plotted his wife's death
so he could marry his teen-age sister-in-law, who he later tried to
kill.
   ``The circumstances of this case are unbelievable,'' McCartin
said. ``You are a scary person. For you to be able to get one of
your children to kill your wife ... you make Charlie Manson look
like a piker.''
   In a separate matter Monday, Brown was given a six-year prison
term for a jailhouse plot to kill his current wife, another man and
Jeoffrey Robinson, the lead prosecutor in his case. The sentence is
to run concurrently with the life sentence.
   ``You're just a master manipulator,'' McCartin said. ``I don't
know how you could do that to another human being.''
   Defense attorney Gary Pohlson said the sentences were ``exactly
what I expected.''
   Brown, owner of a computer company, was convicted in June of
masterminding his wife Linda's death and persuading his then
14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon, to commit the slaying.
   Cinnamon Brown spent three years in a youth prison before she
told authorities that her father planned the murder and urged her
to carry it out on March 19, 1985.
   While the girl was jailed, Brown collected $835,000 in life
insurance taken out on his wife and married Patricia Bailey, the
younger sister of the slain woman.
   Ms. Bailey, a minor at the time her sister was killed, pleaded
guilty to participating in the scheme and was imprisoned by the
California Youth Authority in May 1989.

<HEAD>New Teachers Idealistic But Fear They Lack Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of more than 1,000 fledgling teachers
finds them full of optimism that they can make a difference but
fearful that they are unprepared for problem-plagued youngsters.
   The poll of teachers entering classes for the first time this
fall, issued Monday by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., found that
99 percent believe that all children can learn, and 83 percent said
they were confident they can make a difference in pupils' lives.
   But 58 percent said they wish they had more practical training
before entering the classroom. Two-thirds said they believe all
teachers should be required to take a national standardized test to
prove their qualifications.
   And 45 percent agreed that even the best teachers will have
difficulty succeeding with more than two-thirds of their students.
Three-fourths believe many children come to school with so many
problems that it's hard for them to become good students.
   The survey was the eighth poll of teacher attitudes conducted by
the insurance company since 1984.
   ``What is most striking ... is the enormous idealism with which
new teachers are approaching their jobs,'' the survey concluded.
``Before getting caught up in the realities of the job, they have a
very strong faith in what children, and they themselves, can
achieve.''
   Sharply contrasting with that optimism, a survey of more than
21,000 veteran teachers released two weeks ago by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching found that 61 percent
consider morale at their schools fair or poor. It also found a
majority souring on the progress of school reform.
   ``I can almost guarantee that unless government and other
institutions start solving the out-of-school problems of kids, and
unless our schools change dramatically to support teaching and
learning, five years from now this idealistic and committed group
of new teachers will be leaving the profession in droves,'' said
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
reacting to the latest poll.
   The 1,002 teachers surveyed by Met Life were selected randomly
from a list of this spring's teacher college graduates compiled by
the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.
   The survey was conducted by telephone in July and August by
Louis Harris and Associates Inc. It had a margin of sampling error
of plus or minus three percentage points.
   Met Life said it plans to poll the same group next spring to
determine their attitudes after a year of classroom experience.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teacher union, said the survey pointed up the
need for all prospective teachers to gain classroom experience
working with a mentor teacher.
   He also called it disturbing that one out of five new teachers
surveyed felt unprepared to teach students of different ethnic
backgrounds.

<HEAD>First U.S. Ground Unit Into Saudi Arabia Gets New Assignment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPION CITY, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first American ground
forces to reach Saudi Arabia have been given a new mission that
will take them away from the front lines but would put them even
closer to any combat.
   The 82nd Airborne is ill-equipped to fight the strong Iraqi
army. But because of its readiness for swift deployment, it was the
first U.S. Army combat unit to hit Saudi soil under Operation
Desert Shield.
   Now, as heavier, tank-fighting hardware arrives, the military
wants the paratroopers to get ready for another job - perhaps to
parachute into Iraq or Kuwait if necessary, top officers say.
   The 82nd - some members of which spent last Christmas in Panama
- began arriving within a day of President Bush's Aug. 8 decision
to send troops to help defend the Saudi kingdom from possible
attack by Iraqi forces.
   With Vietnam-era M551 Sheridan light tanks, the 82nd would have
proved no match for Iraqi forces, had they decided to continue
south from Kuwait with their heavy Soviet tanks.
   ``In those early days we were as much a political statement
about the United States position as a deterrent force,'' one 82nd
officer said recently. ``For some time there were a lot fewer of us
here than they were telling the folks back home.''
   Another 82nd member, who like his senior officer spoke on
condition of anonymity, said he was confined to base at Fort Bragg,
N.C. waiting to be sent to Saudi Arabia when he read in the paper
that his unit already was en route.
   ``Maybe we had Saddam Hussein fooled too,'' he said. ``I thought
it was pretty funny.''
   The 82nd was deployed in northeast Saudi Arabia to secure
airstrips and port facilities for arriving U.S. forces. It also
formed a thin defensive line against Iraqi aggression - about 150
miles from the Kuwaiti border.
   The unit's desert base was first named All-American City, then
changed to Champion City because of Saudi objections.
   As other troops began to arrive, the 82nd conducted desert
exercises to get used to the searing heat, and last week held
drills with the Sheridans, which are light enough to be dropped by
air into battle.
   Now, with heavy armored divisions from the Army and Marines
taking up positions much further north, the 82nd has begun to pull
back.
   ``Paratroopers don't fight tanks,'' a senior Army officer said
this past week. ``It's time we get the 82nd into a mission that
fits the unit.''
   That new mission, according to sources who agreed to dicuss it
on grounds that specific details and locations not be disclosed, is
more in line with the 82nd's reputation as what the Army calls its
premier ``forced entry'' unit.
   If orders come to take part in an offensive against Iraq, top
officers in the 82nd believe the unit could be called on to drop
into Kuwait or southern Iraq behind the occupation forces and
attempt to cut off their supply lines.
   The unit recently ordered a parachute shipment from home.
   Rules prohibit saying how many members of the 82nd are in Saudi
Arabia, but most of the 15,000-member division has been deployed.
   Over the past week, a brigade-size detachment from the 82nd was
pulled back to a camp not far from a Saudi air base.
   The remaining units likely will receive new orders in the next
two to three weeks, provided that expected heavy armor arrives.
   The pullback will continue unless hostilities break out.
   There had been talk of pulling the unit out of Saudi Arabia and
stationing it elsewhere in the Persian Gulf region, but it now
appears the new base camp will be within Saudi Arabia, the sources
said.

   Doug Stickler is sticking his neck out for
ostrich meat.
   Stickler, who with his older brother Mike have an ostrich spread
in the middle of Oklahoma Panhandle cattle country, predict meat
from the bareheaded bird will be the health food of the '90s.
   The Sticklers have brought four of their flightless flock to the
Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona.
   ``It won't be long until you see people eating Kentucky fried
ostrich,'' Stickler said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``It's
definitely the future.''
   The Turpin, Okla., rancher said the meat is low in cholesterol,
high in protein and tastes like steak with the texture of veal.
Stickler said doctors and nutrition experts who have seen the
future are investing in ostriches.
   Cost per pound - $10, since there are so few of the birds in the
United States. But Doug figures in 20 years, he'll be giving the
beef a run for its money.
   ``At first, we got a lot of teasing from the area ranchers. They
thought we were crazy,'' he said. ``Well, those same ones that
teased us have been coming down to see what we're doing.''
   Stickler got into the ostrich breeding business in 1986. He
bought his first birds from ostrich-farming monks in Oklahoma City.
   Two years later, the Sticklers moved their 10,000 head of cattle
out and moved the birds in - about 175 of them now. The brothers
have sold more than 300 chicks nationwide. Prices range from $500
to $3,000 per chick.
   ``You just feed 'em, water 'em and leave 'em alone,'' he said.
``With cattle you worked from dark to dark. Back home it takes 30
minutes to do the ostrich chores.''
   Stickler said that according to the American Ostrich
Association, there are more than 5,000 ostriches being bred across
the country. The association predicts an ostrich population boom of
75,000 to 100,000 by mid-1990.

   ``Welcome aboard, gentlemen,''
said the Air Force loadmaster. ``You'll be flying Freedom Bird to
the world's largest beach without water.''
   The joke didn't register with the men of the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment. After a night of delays they just wanted to get on the
C-141 and sleep the expected 19 hours it would take to fly from
Georgia to Saudi Arabia.
   But sleep would not be easy to come by this night for the South
Carolina National Guard unit.
   The hold of the big cargo plane was packed. There was a scant
two feet between the unit's four pickup trucks and the row of red
web seats along the side of the plane.
   The 14 men couldn't stretch their legs. They couldn't lie down.
They couldn't read in the dim gloom of the cargo hold. And they
couldn't stay warm.
   As the plane climbed to 37,000 feet, the temperature in the hold
dropped to the low 60s. The men rolled down the sleeves of their
desert uniforms, buttoned up their collars and shivered through the
long night.
   ``The only way you can do it is stand up for a while to get warm
and then hope you can fall asleep,'' said Sgt. Hullie Cohen, who
served in the Air Force before joining the Guard.
   The water purification unit from Allendale, S.C., deployed for
Saudi Arabia late Friday after 16 days of training at Fort Stewart,
Ga., boarded the plane just before midnight. Their M-16s were on
their shoulders and they carried white plastic bags with water,
rations, and a toiletry bag containing toothbrush, toothpaste,
razors, shaving cream, sunscreen, bug spray, skin conditioner, lip
balm, eye drops and deodorant.
   ``This is good enough for a vacation,'' said Sgt. John Williams.
   But the next nine hours were no vacation.
   The plane, the name ``Sandbox Express,'' stenciled on its side,
looked huge on the floodlit runway. But once aboard, space was a
premium.
   The web seats dug into the men as they tried to get comfortable.
Some used their soft-sided canteens as pillows. Conversation was
impossible. The engines' roar was hardly muted by the yellow foam
plugs sticking out of each man's ears.
   Riding in the windowless hold was like cruising through the
ocean in the belly of a whale.
   The plane stopped at Torrejon Air Base near Madrid for fuel and
a fresh crew, giving the 265th three hours to wash up in the
crowded bathroom, send postcards home and watch a Clint Eastwood
movie on a big screen television set up in a hanger.
   Spc. Mark Rooker, 20, the youngest member of the unit, spent his
time staring at the scenery. Rooker hasn't traveled much, and he
was fascinated by the flat landscape.
   ``I'd like to come back here someday,'' he said.
   Back on the plane, the men ate an Air Force box lunch of ham and
cheese sandwiches and packaged Spanish pastries. Some visited the
cockpit crew as the plane passed from Spanish to French air
controllers over the Mediterranean.
   Seven hours later, the plane rolled to a stop at a Saudi
airport. It was 3 a.m. local time. The men scrambled down the
ladder in full combat gear, carrying the South Carolina state flag.
But the only one to greet them was a bored sergeant who led them
past giant cargo planes and a road busy with truck traffic.
   They stopped at an intersection where a half dozen men were busy
filling sandbags in the glare of a truck's headlights.
   The 265th watched, a little stupefied from their long flight.
   ``OK,'' said Sgt. Earnest Deloach. ``The joke's over. Let's go
back home.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, driven by the
radicals who control the Parliament of the largest Soviet republic,
seems to have accepted their prescription for the gasping Soviet
economy: capitalism.
   The economy's fall into depression was a major impetus. But the
final push came from Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who won
approval for the drastic reforms in the Russian Parliament this
week and forced Gorbachev's hand.
   Yeltsin threatened to pursue his economic revolution in Russia -
which contains half the Soviet people and three-quarters of the
country's land mass - with or without Gorbachev's support.
   Gorbachev went along.
   The economic plan he distributed to the national Parliament on
Friday ``95 percent coincides'' with the Russian plan, Russian
Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky told his Parliament on
Saturday.
   That is an exaggeration. Gorbachev rejected some key points and
a parliamentary battle remains to be fought. But the comment was a
good indication that the Russian radicals feel they have already
won.
   In the five years since he came to power proclaiming the need
for reform, Gorbachev has tinkered with the Communist system,
trying to fill the barren shelves of Soviet stores.
   Now, he has thrown his support behind an economic reform plan
full of ideas that warm the hearts of capitalists and horrify
die-hard Communists: private land, home ownership, merit pay and
profits.
   It also contains the thorns of capitalism: unemployment, factory
closings, bankruptcies and rising prices. In the first months of
switching to a market economy, the Soviet Union is likely to feel
the full pain of these thorns.
   Gorbachev this week was defensive, thumping his fist in
Parliament as he told Soviet legislators such radical change would
have been impossible earlier.
   ``A year and a half ago, we were just talking about pluralism,''
he said, referring to the Soviet Union's dramatic switch to
multicandidate elections.
   If he had heeded calls to change from a centrally planned to a
market economy then, Gorbachev said, ``Do you think anything would
have come of it? That's nonsense.''
   ``We needed all that time to think about things. Otherwise,
there would have been such a tragedy, such confusion in the
country, that we never could have escaped it,'' he said.
   Now, however, the changes must come quickly, Gorbachev admitted.
   ``The old structures are falling apart and the new ones are not
yet formed,'' he said. ``There is no system in the true sense of
the word.''
   His own economic reform plan says the country already has
entered an economic depression, with rising foreign debt and
declining ability to pay. The country's international economic
position, the plan said, is ``catastrophic.''
   As a result, Gorbachev's economic plan says the gradual
transition to a market economy proposed by Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov would be too slow.
   Without urgent action, ``we would be forced to choose between
hyperinflation and direct seizure of cash from the population and
enterprises,'' the plan says.
   Ryzhkov went on national television Saturday night to argue for
his moderate approach to reform and to insist on retaining, through
1991, the rigid Soviet bureaucracy that now runs the economy.
   In arguing against the Russian republic's plan, Ryzhkov
predicted it would lead to a 30 percent drop in the country's
standard of living.
   But Ryzhkov's plan, which calls for dramatic price increases on
Jan. 1 without fundamental structural changes, is so unpopular that
legislators have called for his resignation. And about 50,000
Muscovites demonstrated near Red Square in a cold rain Sunday
evening, calling for Ryzhkov to step down.
   Still remaining, however, is the battle over sections of the
Russian plan that would strip the central government of much of its
power.
   Gorbachev has rejected that notion, including calls to transform
the country into an economic association like the European
Community. His plan also deletes the Russian call for republic laws
to supersede national legislation.
   Neither Gorbachev nor any other Soviet politician has dared
define the coming changes as ``capitalism.''
   Instead, officials say it's time to kill off the dying
authoritarian system and get on with what they call ``normal
life.''

   NBC's legal drama ``L.A. Law'' won three
top honors in Sunday's 42nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards show,
while ABC's mysterious ``Twin Peaks,'' with 14 nominations, won the
hole in the doughnut.
   ``L.A. Law'' won best drama, writing and best supporting actor
for Jimmy Smits. ``Twin Peaks,'' a post-Modern tale of murder,
assion and diner food in the Pacific Northwest, won only for its
editing and costuming in non-televised awards Saturday.
   CBS' newsroom comedy ``Murphy Brown'' won for best comedy series
and Candice Bergen, who plays the title role, won for best actress
for a second consecutive year.
   Tracey Ullman, the British comedian who quit her critically
acclaimed but low-rated ``Tracey Ullman Show'' last spring, won the
most trophies of anybody. Her series and a special combined for six
statuettes.
   In the network competition, ABC emerged with 22 awards, followed
by NBC with 18 and CBS with 14. The Fox Broadcasting Co. won nine
awards, and cable television's Home Box Office collected eight.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences chose as best
miniseries NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,'' an account of
the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. ``This is
a victory for him, too,'' said executive producer Michael Mann.
   Patricia Wettig, who plays the cancer-stricken young mother on
ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' won the best dramatic actress trophy,
and Peter Falk won the Emmy for outstanding actor in a drama
series.
   ``I would really like to thank all the women with cancer who
have shared their stories with me so wholeheartedly,'' Miss Wettig
said. ``I shared their insights and their fears. I truly salute
their courage.''
   Falk, 63, who has played the rumpled homicide detective since
1971, told the Pasadena Civic Auditorium audience it was his
birthday. ``You know, to get one of these things at any age is
nice, but when you hit 41 . . ,'' he said.
   Marg Helgenberger, who plays the prostitute K.C. on ABC's
``China Beach'' won for best supporting actress in a dramatic
series, and Smits, who plays Hispanic lawyer Victor Sifuentes on
``L.A. Law,'' won as supporting actor.
   ``I want to thank all of the Vietnam vets who have so graciously
shared their experience with us,'' said Miss Helgenberger, who
thanked ABC for its last-minute decision to renew the Vietnam
series: ``You won't regret it.''
   The award for best dramatic direction was shared by Thomas
Carter, for ``Equal Justice'' and Scott Winant for
``thirtysomething.''
   Miss Ullman was honored with a pair of Emmy awards in the
music-variety category for her work as star and a writer of ``The
Tracey Ullman Show.''
   ``Oh, blimey, this brings it all full circle,'' she said. ``I
miss the show a whole lot. Maybe I shouldn't have been so cavalier.
Maybe I should have taken that ten minutes in the middle of `The
Simpsons,''' she said.
   The hit Fox cartoon series, selected as top animated program in
earlier awards, began as brief commercial ``bumpers'' on her
program.
   ``I breast-fed those little devils,'' Miss Ullman told the
black-tie audience moments after she and her show's writers shared
the writing Emmy with comedian Billy Crystal and his HBO special
``Midnight Train to Moscow.''
   ``In Living Color,'' the irreverent Fox sketch comedy show won
the best music-variety Emmy. ``Above all, I'd like to thank my
family,'' said Keenan Ivory Wayans, the show's star and executive
producer. ``My mother and father are here tonight. This is for you,
Ma.''
   ``Cheers'' finally brought an Emmy to Ted Danson, nominated
eight times for best actor in a comedy series for his role as
womanizing bartender Sam Malone.
   It was the eighth consecutive year, every year the show has been
on the air, that Danson was nominated. His other Emmy nomination
was in 1984 for the TV movie ``Something About Amelia.''
   Danson's award was presented by the animated family from Fox's
``The Simpsons.'' The series' obnoxious son, Bart, shredded the
envelope containing the winner's name and thn jokingly announced
himself as the recipient.
   Danson said it was ``appropriate'' to receive his trophy from
cartoon characters. ``I feel a little weird. I felt like if it
didn't happen this year it would be more embarrassing than ever
before.''
   Hume Cronyn, who starred in HBO's ``Age Old Friends,'' won for
best actor in a miniseries or special. Barbara Hershey, the lead in
CBS' ``A Killing in a Small Town,'' won the Emmy for best actress
in a miniseries or special.
   Playwright Terrence McNally was voted the Emmy for writing in a
miniseries or special for ``Andre's Mother,'' a drama about AIDS.
   Joseph Sargent was named best director in a miniseries or
special for his work on CBS' ``Caroline?'' Vincent Gardenia won for
supporting actor in a miniseries or special, given for Home Box
Office's ``Age Old Friends.''
   Eva Marie Saint took the trophy for supporting actress in a
miniseries or special, co-starring in NBC's ``People Like Us.''
   Alex Rocco won the Emmy as comedy's outstanding suppporting
actor for his portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in ``The
Famous Teddy Z.'' The supporting actress award went to Bebe
Neuwirth, the self-possessed psychoanalyst on ``Cheers.''
   ``The Wonder Years'' collected trophies for best directing
(Michael Dinner) and writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series.
   A special recognition was given to puppeteer Jim Henson, who
died earlier this year. Leonard Goldenson, founder of the American
Broadcasting Cos., was selected as the recipient of the annual
Governor's Award. He joins such previous winners as Grant Tinker,
Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Alistair Cooke.
   The Emmy for outstanding achievement in casting was announced in
August. It went to Randy Stone and Holly Powell for casting CBS'
``The Incident.''
   The telecast was seen in more than two dozen countries. The
academy estimated 150 million people would see the show outside the
United States, including viewers in Bangladesh, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua and Venezuela.

<HEAD>The Comedy of Crisis: `Take My Mullah-in-Law ... Please!'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``A human shield? Take my mullah-in-law ...
please!'' Barrump-bump! From the Top 10 lists of ``Late Night'' to
the political humor of Will Durst and Harry Shearer, humorists are
finding comedy in the Gulf crisis.
   On Aug. 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait and erased its Kuwaitibank Visa
card's $10 billion tab. That same night, ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' offered ``Saddam Hussein's Top Ten Reasons for Invading
Kuwait.''
   Reason No. 6: ``To impress Jodie Foster;'' No. 3: ``Didn't have
enough fuel and supplies to invade the moon;'' and No. 1 ... (drum
roll) ... ``Because the sand is always grainier on the other side
of the border.''
   Nobody said it's easy being a jester in the court of public
opinion.
   ``It's hard coming up with the lighter side of Armageddon,''
said Will Durst, a comic who specializes in politics and writes a
weekly column for the San Francisco Examiner. Saddam is funny, the
invasion wasn't.
   ``When he invaded, it was tough,'' Durst said. ``I turned it on
him and made him the focus: `You know Saddam is a bad guy because
Switzerland is (angry) at him. Imagine: Switzerland, the Aunt Bea
of the U.N.' ''
   `Saddam Hussein is such a bad guy that if he were an American,
John Sununu would still be governor of New Hampshire.'''
   ``I call Saddam Hussein a yuppie. His motives are something we
can all understand: Greed. I mean, this is a corporate raider with
tanks.''
   ``At least this guy has a motive we can relate to - because (as
Americans) we never got past the suicide-terrorist thing. I mean,
how do those people get paid? Is it a union thing?''
   Durst gets serious, too: ``It's obvious that America would
rather sacrifice its boys than carpool.'' Saddam, he said, ``is the
symptom, not the problem. Taking out Hussein would be like whiting
out a tumor on an X-ray.''
   Political impressionist Jim Morris made his name portraying
Ronald Reagan as an amiable dimwit, but these days his focus is
George Bush and his handling of the Gulf crisis. Morris says it's a
sensitive topic and he's very careful.
   ``I am a lot kinder to the president in this situation than I am
when he wants to cut funding for school lunch programs,'' Morris
said.
   Then, in the voice he calls ``a cross between Liberace, Jack
Nicholson and Mister Rogers,'' Morris drawls, ``I don't hafta
defend the way I been handlin' the crisis. M' door's always open.
'M never there, but m' door's always open.' ''
   Some top comedians aren't doing the Gulf crisis. ``Robert Klein
has nothing on the Middle East,'' said his publicist Glen Schwartz.
Richard Belzer said he's too worried about the situation to find it
funny.
   ``My problem is that Americans have such a short attention span
that they're going to get bored and almost will something to
happen,'' Belzer said. ``I'd rather be bored for the rest of my
life than have one 18-year-old get his head blown off because we're
not prudent enough to conserve oil.''
   Harry Shearer, a comedian, writer, star and co-author of the
pseudo-documentary ``This Is Spinal Tap'' and occasional voice on
``The Simpsons,'' uses the Gulf crisis in ``Le Show,'' his eekly
National Public Radio program.
   ```Le Show' is basically a topically oriented show,'' Shearer
said. ``I'm almost obliged to do material about the crisis. For the
last four weeks it has pretty much been the only subject.''
   Saddam's appearing on TV with hostages prompted Shearer to
imagine him savvier about Western media and getting Robin Leach to
gush breathlessly over his lifestyle and ``pleasure palaces that
rival the pashas of Persia!''
   Then there was Shearer's sketch on the last woman hostage
leaving blockaded Iraq when the Iraqis detain her, suspicious of
her 5 o'clock shadow.
   It turns out she's a transsexual who has been cut off, as it
were, from her supplies of hormones and depilatories. The Iraqis
don't know what to make of her. Should she stay or should she go?
   A war without fighting is funny. Shearer acknowledges that Gulf
crisis humor risks offending people when a good joke is suddenly
made tasteless by events, but he's also quite careful about his
timing.
   ``I do stuff so close to when it airs that I'm not going to get
caught by surprise if something happens,'' Shearer said.
   ``I think it doesn't start to get risky, really, until body bags
start coming back. Then all the equations start changing.''

<HEAD>National Service Bills Stray from Sponsors' Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House and Senate have passed
multimillion-dollar bills establishing a civilian ``national
service'' corps for young people. But originators of the idea say
the differing bills bear little resemblance to what they had in
mind.
   ``The committee picked up the ball but forgot to run,'' Rep.
Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., one of the sponsors of national service,
said after the House passed its bill last Thursday. ``This bill is
not national service.''
   Nonetheless, the $193 million bill the House approved on a voice
vote after long debate bears the title National Service Act. It now
goes to a conference committee to work out differences with the
Senate, which passed a $125 million bill that, although less
costly, is more ambitious.
   McCurdy and other original sponsors hope the final version will
include a provision in the Senate's bill, a $35 million
demonstration program that will test their idea for linking
national youth service with financial aid incentives.
   It's a plan that the House did not include. The chairman of the
House panel that wrote the bill, retiring Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., opposed the idea and said his committee ``categorically
rejects any linkage between service and student financial
assistance.''
   The idea of a national service corps to encourage young people
to do social works the nation otherwise couldn't afford has been
bound up in political differences that go beyond pride of
authorship.
   President Bush uttered the phrase ``a thousand points of light''
in his nominating speech and later refined it into a modest $25
million plan to establish a clearinghouse for community service -
publicizing successful projects and encouraging new ones.
   Critics of that idea, however, concluded it would do little to
actually support an organized effort harnessing the energy and time
of young people to do constructive social or environmental work
benefiting their communities.
   Moderate and conservative Democrats who lead the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group formed to counterbalance what they see
as the more liberal national party organization, proposed a more
sweeping plan in January 1989.
   Their bill would have made student financial aid contingent on a
full-time stint in the military or in low-wage community service.
Their bill would have phased out current forms of student aid in
five years.
   It would amount to a ``civilian GI bill,'' a civilian program
comparable to the benefits that encourage military service,
according to its sponsors, led by McCurdy in the House and Sens.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Charles Robb, D-Va.
   Their plan met stiff resistance, however, and in the Senate they
settled for the scaled-back pilot program. Participants could
receive vouchers for use toward college, a first home purchase or
establishment of a small business - worth $5,000 for one yea's
service.
   ``I haven't dropped my original thinking on the subject, but I
do think we ought to go slowly and determine what works,'' Nunn
said.
   Critics, who include liberal Democrats as well as Republicans,
said tying aid to service would penalize low-income students while
allowing the affluent to escape service obligations. Supporters,
however, said low-income students already have to work to
supplement the meager support they get from existing student aid
programs.
   The House's bill provides grants to states and local school
systems to encourage volunteer activity by young people, and
establishes youth conservation and service corps to do
environmental and social projects.
   Sponsors of the Democratic Leadership Council's plan say
volunteerism is different and more limited in scope than what they
have in mind. They say Hawkins' committee, with its ties to the
establishment education and labor lobbies, basically added money to
existing programs and came up with little more than a traditional
youth jobs program.
   ``From our point of view, the House really missed the point of
national service,'' said Will Marshall, head of the Progressive
Policy Institute, a Democratic think tank that has pushed the idea.
   ``The committee missed an opportunity for a dynamic, fresh
approach because members did not want to touch previously created,
sacred student aid programs,'' McCurdy said.
   But Hawkins contends his bill will encourage volunteer work and
``responds to the same concerns that the president noted when he
proposed his points of light initiative in his inaugural address.''
   ``This bill,'' Hawkins said, ``is an attempt to make the concept
of service more central to Americans' life and work.''

<HEAD>Despite Deep Grievances, Saudi Shiites Don't Heed Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Al-QATIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Shiite Moslems in Saudi Arabia,
long considered a potential fifth column, say they ignore calls
from fundamentalist leaders of their sect in Iran to fight the
Americans in the Middle East.
   But many in the estimated 1 million-strong Shiite community
complain that discrimination by the Saudi government has left them
with a wrenching sense of their minority status.
   The subject is so sensitive that most Shiites don't want to talk
at all about their treatment.
   ``It's such a difficult question,'' said one student. ``It's
like punching us in the heart.''
   Shiites interviewed at random over two weeks said they can't
find jobs, no matter how educated they are.
   They also say their freedom to practice their religious rituals
is sharply curtailed and they live under a cloud of suspicion as
Iranian sympathizers.
   ``Nobody feels free,'' said the student, who spoke on condition
he not be identified.
   The Shiites are concentrated in the Eastern Province which
contains most of Saudi Arabia's massive oil deposits, font of the
kingdom's wealth.
   Saudi Arabia's estimated 10 million people are overwhelmingly
members of the mainstream Sunni Moslem sect. It has for centuries
been at odds with the breakaway Shiites, who form the majority of
Iran's 55 million people.
   The split goes back to a 7th century battle over who would
succeed the Prophet Mohammed as leader of all Moslems.
   Ali, the prophet's son-in-law, was defeated and killed in a
battle in what is today Iraq. His defeat produced the Shiite
faction.
   Distrust of Shiites in Saudi Arabia is widespread, especially
since many Saudis adhere to a puritanical Sunni sect, the Wahhabis.
   Last week, Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
called on Moslems in the region to fight a holy war to drive the
Americans and their Western allies from the Persian Gulf.
   But like all Saudis, most Shiites say the threat from Iraq's
Saddam Hussein justifies deploying U.S. troops in the region.
   ``The true believer, whether Shiite or Sunni, is against an
American presence,'' conceded a Shiite gold seller. ``But they'd
rather have the United States here for a while than Saddam.''
   One of their main concerns is that the Americans might start
fighting Iran and bring a resumption of the large-scale arrests
carried out by Saudi Arabia during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   The 1979 revolution in Iran that propelled Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini to power alarmed conservative Saudi Arabia. Khomeini
wanted to export his Islamic revolution and called for the ousting
of the Saudi monarchy.
   Radical Moslems took over the holy mosque in Mecca in 1979 and
Shiites inspired by Iran plotted to topple the governments in
neighboring Bahrain and Kuwait.
   Saudi diplomats overseas were shot, and there was a rash of
bombings in the kingdom. More than 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians,
were killed in Mecca in 1987 in what the Saudis said was
Iranian-inspired riots.
   Saudi Arabia clamped a quota on the number of pilgrims, citing
renovation work in the Mecca. Iran claimed it was a deliberate move
to cut its usual contingent of 150,000 pilgrims by two-thirds.
   In April 1988, Riyadh broke off relations with Tehran, citing
its support for terrorism and subversion.
   A year ago, the Saudis executed 16 Kuwaiti Shiites for a bombing
in Mecca that renewed suspicions they were still ``a potential nest
of conspirators,'' a diplomat said.
   The 20-year-old brother of a teacher in this predominantly
Shiite city was among those arrested at the time. Jailed for eight
months, his treatment included beatings, cigarette burns and
solitary confinement, the teacher claimed.
   ``They asked him over and over again: Do you have any connection
with Iran?'' said the teacher, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   ``The main thing here is that they're afraid of the revolution
in Iran. If they were suspicious of anybody, they took him,'' he
said.
   That suspicion abated with Khomeini's death last year and the
more moderate policies of President Hashemi Rafsanjani that
followed. But the pilgrimage dispute still sours relations.
   Diplomats note the Eastern Province's new governor, King Fahd's
son, Mohammed, has worked hard to improve services in Shiite areas
and been markedly less sweeping with arrests.
   ``The Saudi policy has been to win them over with kindness while
dealing very firmly with any incidents that occur,'' said one
Western diplomat. ``Dissidents are still put in jail to cool off.''
   But Shiites said the lingering effect is an inability to get any
government jobs in a country where most of the people depend on the
state payroll.
   For decades, Shiites had formed the majority of workers at
Aramco, the state-owned oil company. That's now seen as a security
risk.
   Shiites say note of them have been hired by the government since
the Iranian revolution.
   ``The main problem is discrimination,'' one man complained. ``If
anyone from Qatif applies for a job, they take the papers, give him
an interview appointment and then forget him. How can he live?''
   Government officials deny there is any active dicrimination
policy.
   The other big sore point is the ban on certain Shiite religious
traditions, such as self-flagellation during the Ashoura holiday or
mentioning the name Ali, a Shiite saint, in prayer calls.
   Sermons are banned in most mosques and it's impossible to get
permission to build new mosques, Shiites said.
   Any violation is considered a political act and leads to
imprisonment, the Shiites said.
   ``All Saudis are part of society and have to respect the
feelings of the majority,'' said a Saudi prince, speaking on
condition he not be named.

Iraq</HEAD>

   One by one, lawmakers grappling with a U.S.
economy in decline stood on the House floor venting their anger at
American allies unwilling to reach into their deep pockets and help
the campaign against Iraq.
   The rhetoric was fierce. And the main target was Japan.
   ``There is a toll-free number that our friends and allies call
whenever they run into trouble: 800-USA-Free,'' said Rep. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D. ``Japan, more than any other nation, has rung up the
biggest tab on this toll-free line.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had told Congress the U.S.
military buildup in the Persian Gulf region could cost as much as
$15 billion. Budget negotiators, meanwhile, were locked in a
struggle to trim $50 billion from the federal deficit.
   Suddenly, Japan's $1 billion offer of assistance in the gulf
crisis began to look miserly, and the House responded.
   On a 370-53 vote, it approved an amendment last week forcing
Japan to foot the entire bill for stationing 50,000 U.S. troops in
the Asian nation, or begin losing them at a rate of 5,000 a year.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., said the House was giving Japan ``a
good swift kick.''
   Two days later, Japan said it would contribute an additional $3
billion for international forces in the gulf region and for nations
suffering from the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   ``When you're tough, you get respect - and you get a response,''
said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., sponsor of the House measure.
   But some lawmakers saw it differently.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, said the House had hit
the Japanese ``across the snout with a two-by-four'' - a move that
was counterproductive to U.S. efforts to obtain more allied help
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Hamilton, who voted against the measure, said he had spoken to
officials in Japan and they were offended by the House vote.
   ``It complicates our task even if it does not become law,''
Hamilton said.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., shared similar concerns as the Senate
last week approved, 97-2, a resolution saying the United States
should prosecute Saddam and other Iraqi leaders as ``war
criminals'' if hostilities break out in the gulf.
   He said he feared that other nations would mistake the
non-binding resolution as something much more serious than just an
expression of the Senate's anger and frustration.
   ``I appreciate this is a sort of an amendment that looks
relatively harmless,'' Kerrey said. But noting that Iraq was
holding Americans hostage, he added ``What happens if this, in
fact, sends precisely the opposite message. I'm not skilled in the
psychology of somebody who takes hostages and holds them.''
   Similar consternation was evident in April when the Arab world
was affronted when Congress approved a resolution declaring
Jerusalem to be Israel's capital.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas supported the
resolution but after meetings with leaders of four Arab nations -
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq - realized the repercussions from the
congressional action.
   ``These kinds of resolutions, hastily prepared and even more
hastily passed, are nonsense - dangerous nonsense, and we ought to
do something about it,'' Dole said.

   Ace feather detective Roxie Laybourne always
gets her bird. Even when the evidence is a mere wisp of fluffy
down.
   From her cluttered aerie on the top floor of the National Museum
of Natural History, amid storage bins containing more than 600,000
specimens of stuffed birds, the hawk-eyed Mrs. Laybourne reigns as
the nation's foremost authority on feathers.
   Give her a tuft of tail feathers and Roxie (nobody calls her
Mrs. Laybourne) can tell whether they were plucked from an
Australian palm cockatoo, a South African crowned plover or a
Caribbean coot.
   Criminal investigators once tapped her 46 years of expertise in
a murder case involving a wife who shot her sleeping husband with a
pistol wrapped in a feather pillow as a silencer.
   Roxie informed authorities that microscopic traces of down taken
from the bullet lodged in the victim's skull matched the feathers
from the bullet-punctured pillow. The New York Times dubbed her
``Miss Marple of Eiderdown.''
   Roxie squints knowingly from behind her gold-rimmed spectacles
and whispers in a Carolina drawl as thick as grits with ham gravy.
   ``The fingerprint says you are it,'' she confides. ``Feather
evidence says you might be it. The feather puts you at the scene of
the crime.''
   Roxie's knack for unraveling the puzzles of plumage was
discovered in 1960, when an Eastern Airlines turboprop hit a flock
of starlings and crashed shortly after takeoff from Boston, killing
62 people.
   Roxie's identification of the mangled feathers scraped from the
Lockheed Electra's engines led to studies for the Federal Aviation
Administration and major aircraft engine manufacturers on designing
safer, bird-proof planes.
   A Smithsonian research associate, she roams the country
testifying as an expert witness for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service against poachers, smugglers of endangered birds and traders
who sell contraband Indian headdresses containing eagle feathers.
   Roxie also trained Doug Deedrick to become the FBI crime
laboratory's expert on feather identification. ``We met when he was
specializing in hairs and fibers,'' she said. ``I asked him, `Would
you like to learn about feathers? Give me a call and come to my
skinning class.'''
   Roxie's admirers include James Parrish, a research ornithologist
at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who once sent Roxie the
bits and pieces of prey remains from a sharp-shinned hawk's nest in
Alabama.
   ``She identified every one of them - yellow-billed cuckoo,
Northern mockingbird, downy woodpecker and mourning dove,'' Parrish
said. ``She's the best. She's irreplaceable. I don't know anyone
else in the world who can identify feather remains like she can.''
   Kenneth Goddard, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's
forensic laboratory in Oregon, says Roxie's abilities are amazing.
   ``She can identify birds and feathers like they were her own
children,'' he said. ``She can give their height, weight, sex, even
eye color. It's fascinating.''
   As a child in rural Farmville, N.C., Roxie spent hours exploring
the outdoors. ``Growing up in a small town, I was always interested
in anything that creeped and crawled,'' she said. She landed her
first job after college at the North Carolina State Museum of
Natural History in Raleigh in 1937.
   Her curiosity remains undimmed. She is enthralled by the
delicate lacework of the feathers under her microscope, the pronged
nodules on the quills, the pigment cells that sometimes resemble
tiny Vienna sausages.
   ``I'm learning new things every day - that's what makes it
exciting,'' she said. ``The more I delve into my feather stuff, the
more I see that needs explaining. I'll never be finished.''
   Roxie recently got her first glimpse of a ruby-throated
hummingbird's feather magnified 1,500 times under the lens of her
scanning electron microscope.
   ``It was so exciting,'' she said. ``It was like finding mysef
in the middle of a great tropical forest I'd never seen before.
It's as much excitement as I'd ever need.''

<HEAD>Arts Could Win Trial But Lose War on Expression, Director Says</HEAD>

   A gallery director who goes on trial for
exhibiting sexually explicit photos by Robert Mapplethorpe fears
artistic expression will lose even if he and his museum are cleared
of obscenity.
   ``Other arts institutions see what the Contemporary Arts Center
had to go through to prove itself innocent of the charges,'' said
director Dennis Barrie. ``I honestly do believe a lot of people
won't do what they believe in, as a result of this.''
   Art authorities and experts in constitutional law have said they
expect the gallery ultimately to be cleared, even if it loses the
trial set to begin Sept. 24 in Hamilton County Municipal Court.
   The real impact will come if a prosecutor elsewhere follows
Cincinnati's lead, said Floyd Abrams, a New York City lawyer who
defends First Amendment cases.
   ``One more indictment by one more prosecutor, let alone two
convictions, would change the entire picture for museums
nationwide,'' he said. ``I think a lot rides on the result of the
Cincinnati prosecution.''
   The gallery is the first ever indicted on obscenity charges.
They stem from a six-week, 175-item of Mapplethorpe's photos, seven
of which led to the charges.
   The photos, which include homosexual and sadomasochistic images,
stirred debate last year over federal funding of art. The National
Endowment for the Arts, which had supported Mapplethorpe's works,
adopted a requirement that grant recipients pledge not to use money
for works that might be considered obscene. Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., had pressed for the policy.
   Barrie faces up to a year in jail and $2,000 in fines. The
gallery faces $10,000 in fines.
   The Hamilton County prosecutor's office said it is duty-bound to
enforce Ohio's obscenity laws. ``If there's a criminal violation,
we have to look into it. It's that simple,'' said spokesman Chip
Gerhardt.
   ``To say nothing about it would be a form of acceptance. We
don't want that. The people don't want that,'' said Monty Lobb Jr.,
president of Citizens Concerned for Community Values in Cincinnati.
It has denounced Mapplethorpe's photos.
   The case against Barrie and the gallery is just one of a series
of challenges this year to art works:
   -In April, federal agents in San Francisco seized photographer
Jock Sturges' pictures of ``naturists.'' The man who processed the
film faces child pornography charges, and a federal grand jury is
investigating Sturges.
   -In July, a federal prosecutor in Maine dropped a court fight to
destroy a 1962 photograph of a nude father and son by photographer
Walter Chappell. The picture was seized from a traveler crossing
the Canadian border.
   -In August, a Los Angeles lawyer who calls himself a devout
Christian filed a lawsuit over a government grant to a photo
exhibit by David Wojnarowicz. The lawyer said the exhibit depicted
Jesus Christ as an intravenous drug user.
   -On Sept. 5, a Boston court rejected a request by the
conservative American Family Association to file obscenity charges
against the Institute for Contemporary Art, where the Mapplethorpe
exhibit opened Aug. 1.
   The Contemporary Arts Center has spent $95,000 on legal bills
and budgeted $100,000 more for legal costs in the fiscal year that
began Sept. 7.
   The gallery's legal defense fund has received grants from the J.
Roderick MacArthur Foundation and the Nathan Cummings Foundation.
The Rockefeller Foundation has given $50,000 to replace money that
was spent on legal costs.

<HEAD>Israel Seeks More U.S. Defense Aid to Balance U.S. Aid to Saudis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain. Meeting with Cheney set for 3 p.m.
EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

   Israel wants more money and weapons from the
United States so it can keep up with the massive arms sales to
Saudi Arabia planned by the Bush administration.
   Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens planned to deliver that
message to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and congressional leaders
today.
   The administration is preparing to ask Congress to approve the
sale of $18 billion worth of planes, tanks and other weapons to
Saudi Arabia over the next few years, sources say.
   Israel has not been consulted about the deal, Arens said in a
speech Sunday to a conference of the Washington Institute for Near
East Studies.
   ``I hope there will be discussions with us because I'm sure that
there cannot be anybody in Washington that does not feel that that
kind of an arms deal would have an effect on Israel that couldn't
be positive,'' Arens told the gathering at Wye Plantation, Md.
   ``And we would have to have discussions to see what could be
done ... that will provide the necessary equilibrium,'' he added.
   Technically, Israel and Saudi Arabia are in a state of war
although the two sides have not fought directly since 1948. The
Saudis fund the Palestine Liberation Organization and others among
Israel's enemies.
   The United States has for years supplied Israel with sufficient
weapons to maintain a qualitative edge over the far larger armies
of its hostile Arab neighbors.
   But in recent years the United States has eroded Israel's
advantage by selling the Arabs everything it sells Israel, Arens
said. As a result, Israel relies increasingly on its home-grown
defense industry.
   Israeli sources say Israel will ask for an increase in the $1.8
billion the United States gives Israel annually in defense aid. The
increase would be used to help Israel develop and produce new
weapons.
   Arens also wants answers on a shopping list Israel gave the
administration several weeks ago, including F-15 and F-16 fighter
jets and a leasing arrangement for U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile
missiles, said the sources.
   One of the thorniest issues on Arens' agenda is Israel's desire
for direct access to U.S. spy satellites orbiting over the Arab
world, the sources say.
   The United States has balked at giving Israel raw satellite
photos so Israel may ask instead for processed pictures or any
other intelligence information the United States is willing to
provide, the sources said.
   Arens warned that the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
resulting arms sales to the Saudis and other U.S. allies were
escalating the arms race in the Mideast and destabilizing the
region.
   He said Israel would be willing to discuss a halt of the arms
flow into the area, if its Arab enemies did the same.
   ``We don't have the resources to compete'' with Saudi arms
acquisitions and those of other oil-rich Arab states, Arens said.

   Knocking the annual Emmy Awards show has become
sort of like drop-kicking a wounded butterfly.
   So let us be charitable this time and say that Sunday's edition
of network television's annual back-pat festival was tolerable,
efficient and ran only 14 minutes beyond its allotted three hours
on the Fox network.
   It offered one funny animated guest-presenting bit by Fox's
``The Simpsons;'' a lovely but too short tribute to the late Jim
Henson, and speeches that generally were brief and to the point.
   There also was one surprise. It was that David Lynch's quirky
``Twin Peaks,'' so loudly hailed by those who can spell postmodern,
got no Emmy in the major categories.
   It must be that Hollywood looked at ratings of the ABC series
and decided it's time to be derriere garde.
   With three hosts - Candice Bergen of ``Murphy Brown, who won a
best-actress Emmy, Jay Leno and NBC News' Jane Pauley - Sunday's
ceremonies from the tiny republic of Pasadena were akin to last
year's effort - dull but painless.
   The specially made ``Simpsons'' clip in the show's first hour
was nifty, though. The goggle-eyed clan was on hand to present,
through the magic of animation, the award for best actor in a
comedy series.
   Little Bart Simpson, who wanted the honor that Ted Danson of
``Cheers'' finally won, tore up the envelope and scattered the
pieces. Lisa, his good little sister, tried to make the best of
things.
   ``Members of the creative community,'' she said, ``this could be
a blessing in disguise - a chance to do away with winner and
loser.''
   If members of the black-tie audience felt that competition
should be a thing of the past and all the other winning envelopes
torn up, she said, ``then stand up and applaud.''
   Everyone remained seated. Nobody applauded. And you wonder why
television gives you shows like ``thirtysomething.''
   Sunday's here's-your-statue festival was put together by some TV
veterans, including executive producer Martin Starger andco-writer
Buz Kohan.
   Their labors yielded an evening that was professional and crisp
enough. But it was oddly short on show-biz flash.
   Jay Leno, normally sharp, recycled a few Saddam Hussein jokes
and seemed to be saving the good stuff for Christmas.
   Jane Pauley, resplendent in a reddish satin jacket, seemed out
of place. She just smiled, introduced presenters, then withdrew.
   There were no lavish production numbers, no impassioned pleas to
save the Brazilian rain forest, the whales, or even 2 Live Crew.
   Although double-winner Tracey Ullman was merry and showed
welcome signs of life, the proceedings generally were so sedate
that MTV's Downtown Julie Brown wore a black derby.
   Oh well. Things could have been worse. They could have broadcast
the awards for all 78 categories, including ``outstanding
achievement in hairstyling for a miniseries or a special.''

   Walter Cronkite has begun writing his memoirs at
last. He signed a contract for his autobiography 20 years ago.
   ``I have probably the longest existing book contract in the
history of publishing,'' the former CBS anchorman said in the Sept.
24 issue of People magazine.
   The 73-year-old Cronkite, who signed a contract with publisher
Alfred A. Knopf Inc., finally got around to working on the book
this summer.
   It won't be a tell-all about CBS News. ``It seems to me there
have been enough books about all that,'' he said.
   And the title? ``I'm going to have to fight the publishers to
keep them from calling it `And That's the Way It Is.' I think we
might come up with something more imaginative.''

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Charlton Heston, who has been stumping
for two Republican congressmen, will relinquish the podium soon to
take on the role of Sherlock Holmes.
   Heston said Sunday he's traveling to London this month to begin
work on ``Crucifer of Blood,'' a film based on Paul Giovanni's play
about the Arthur Conan Doyle sleuth. The movie will be directed by
his son, Fraser Heston.
   Heston starred in a 1980 stage production of ``Crucifer of
Blood.''
   Earlier Sunday, Heston spoke at a rally for Rep. Bill Dickinson
of Montgomery, seeking his 14th term. On Saturday, he spoke in
support of Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., at a news conference in
Atlanta.
   The Oscar-winning actor, who has long been active in politics,
praised Dickinson and Gingrich for their ``energy, wisdom and
influence.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Hotel queen Leona M. Helmsley took out a
full-page ad in today's The New York Times to chastise Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for referring to hostages as ``guests.''
   ``I know something about how one is supposed to treat guests,
Mr. Hussein,'' she said. ``I have been inviting guests from around
the world into my hotels for 18 years. The people held in your
grasp are not guests.''
   Helmsley appealed to Saddam to release foreigners who have been
prevented from leaving Iraq or Kuwait since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   ``I can make one recommendation that I have never made in all
the years I have been welcoming people: Mr. Hussein, it is time to
check out,'' she said.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 70, who is president of Helmsley Hotels, was
convicted in 1989 of federal tax fraud charges and was sentenced to
four years in prison and fined $7.1 million. She is free on appeal.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ed McMahon and his wife, Victoria, have
cleared a final obstacle delaying their divorce.
   A statement issued by the McMahons said they had ``reached an
amicable agreement to our mutual satisfaction.'' The obstacle was
not described and there was no elaboration.
   McMahon, the 67-year-old ``Tonight Show'' sidekick to Johnny
Carson and host of the ``Star Search'' talent show, filed for
divorce in 1989 after 13 years of marriage. The couple have an
adopted daughter, Katherine.
   After a hearing a year ago, Mrs. McMahon's attorney said McMahon
had agreed to child and spousal support of $50,000 a month and
shared custody of Katherine. The lawyer said the divorce would not
become final until at least January 1991 for tax reasons.

   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) - The business manager for New Kids
on the Block says his briefcase containing $100,000 in cash was
stolen as he checked out of a hotel with the pop group, police
said.
   James Rossi reported to police that the briefcase vanished
Saturday at the Bel Age Hotel, where the group spent the night
after performing to a sold-out crowd Friday at Dodger Stadium.
   Rossi said he put the briefcase on the floor beside him to sign
out and when he turned moments later it was gone, said sheriff's
Deputy George Ducoulombier.
   Authorities said they were uncertain why Rossi had so much cash.
   Calls to the group's management agency, Dick Scott Entertainment
in New York, went unanswered Sunday.

   Rescue workers searched today for
four children lost when a bus carrying preschoolers home from a
party overturned in a flash flood as it forded a river, killing at
least 43 people.
   The dead - 26 children and all seven adults aboard - included an
American missionary who was driving the bus across the rain-swollen
Rio Grande on Sunday when it was hit by the flood wave and pushed
downstream, authorities said.
   National Fire Department spokesman Lt. Frank Medina said three
children were rescued after the midafternoon accident, which
occurred between the villages of El Naranjal and Cantarranas 80
miles southeast of Tegucigalpa.
   The vehicle was carrying 33 children between the ages of 3 and 6
and seven adults, said Red Cross spokesman Jordan Peralta.
   Among the victims was American missionary Dorothy Saunder Hood,
52, wife of the Rev. George B. Hood, Medina said by telephone.
   The children were on their way back to El Naranjal from a party
at Cantarranas, a few miles away, and the bus was crossing the
usually shallow Rio Grande when the flash flood hit, he said.
   There is no bridge over the river on that road.
   ``The accident occurred when the vehicle was in the middle of
the river ... and it was dragged along with all the passengers,''
Peralta said.

   The mysterious deaths of three young
American Indians in 18 months have produced no arrests, and some
Indians think they know why.
   ``If three young, white college students, two of whose parents
were professors, had been killed or died in similar circumstances,
do you think they'd have taken the same attitude?'' asked Don
Bread, father of one victim and law instructor at Haskell Indian
Junior College here. ``From my side of the fence, I'd say no.''
   When Christopher Bread became the third young Indian to be found
dead recently, Indians wondered if a killer wasn't targeting them.
There are about 3,000 Indians in this fast-growing city of 56,000.
   The fear has waned, but the city's Indians still contend police
were too quick to discount foul play because two of the three
victims had blood-alcohol levels above the legal limit, evoking the
stereotype of the drunken Indian.
   Police and sheriff's officials dispute the charge. They say they
investigated the deaths fully and found no connections but continue
to chase leads.
   The body of John Sandoval, a 19-year-old Navajo from Canoncito,
N.M., was found in April 1989 in the Kansas River. He had been
missing since November 1988 and his body was so decomposed the
coroner couldn't pinpoint a cause of death.
   Cecil Dawes Jr., 21, a former West Point cadet whose father
teaches at Haskell, was found in October 1989 floating in river
weeds. He had been missing for 10 days.
   Dawes had left a bar and got his car stuck on railroad tracks.
His young companion told investigators he told her to hide and she
then heard voices. But she has changed her story, investigators
say.
   The coroner's report said Dawes was presumed drowned. His
blood-alcohol level was .18, above the legal limit of .10.
   Although he won't rule out the possibility, Sheriff Loren
Anderson said he'd be surprised if a link between the deaths ever
appeared. He said there is no evidence the victims were murdered or
died the same way.
   Indian leaders say their complaint was never with Anderson. Most
of their anger is directed at the town's police chief, who they say
scoffed at their fears during a meeting after Dawes died.
   Police Chief Ron Olin has said in the past that he thinks
Indians overreacted to the deaths. He no longer gives interviews
because of what his spokesman calls inaccurate information in
newspaper stories.
   The spokesman, Chris Mulvenon, attributed the Indians' anger to
a personality conflict.
   Bread and others disputed that.
   ``He made a strong case that Cecil Dawes was a bad person, that
all we have here is a drunken Indian who went and fell in the
river,'' Bread said. ``He tried to condemn him more than anything
else.''
   Christopher Bread was found with a fractured skull along a rural
road outside of town in early March. He had spent the night at a
building where two heavy metal bands were playing.
   Investigators originally suspected the 19-year-old had been hit
with a blunt instrument, then dragged to the site where he was
found by a motorist, Anderson said.
   But two of three autopsies ordered in the case concluded Bread
died in a hit-and-run accident as he walked along the road late at
night. His blood-alcohol level was nearly .13.
   ``I'm still not totally convinced that our first impression was
wrong,'' Anderson said.
   Bread's shirt was rolled up under his arms, as if he'd been
dragged by the feet, Anderson said. The autopsy said he had scrapes
on his back, plus a gruesome wound on one leg where the skin had
been stripped. There were no skid marks or shattered glass, the
sheriff said.
   ``There had to be someone else around there at the time, and
that person might eventually come forward,'' he said. ``But in the
other two cases, well, the river doesn't talk.''

   A young roofer says he and his wife
haven't gone on vacation in three years and rarely go out. A civil
engineer says he can't save money, and a jeweler says his business
is just ``making a living.''
   They all blame high interest rates, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's chosen tool for squeezing inflation out of the economy.
   Mrs. Thatcher's policy has yet to pay off. On Friday, the
government announced that retail prices were up 10.6 percent in
August compared with a year ago, the highest rate of inflation
since 1982.
   Maidstone, a town of 140,000 residents about 40 miles southeast
of London, is in the heart of Kent County's prosperous commuter
country. Unemployment is below 4 percent, and a 647-acre business
park at Kings Hill in Maidstone is one of the largest economic
development projects in the county.
   However, the region has not been spared the economic pressures
squeezing the rest of the country. The Kent Economic Development
Board says inquiries from businesses have dropped 13 percent since
last year.
   For some individuals, the economic trends add up to a crisis.
   ``A lot of people who had stretched themselves (before) can no
longer cope,'' said Mavis Firth, project leader at Maidstone's
Money Advice Center. ``We can't see all the people who ask for our
help.''
   The center's load of new cases has increased more than 50
percent, and there's a six-week waiting list, she said.
   ``It can take people years to get back on the
straight-and-narrow again,'' Mrs. Firth said.
   Nick Kember, 28, a self-employed roofer, and his 26-year-old
wife Joanne bought a home in 1987 when the mortgage rate was 9.85
percent. Now the rates are 15 percent, and he says it doesn't help
that construction and business in general are slowing down.
   ``It's so tight, really,'' he said.
   Geoffrey Pettitt, a 49-year-old civil engineer, said his monthly
mortgage payment of about $510 is a third higher than it was a year
ago, and has more than offset the increase in his salary.
   At least they still have their homes.
   More than 14,000 homes were repossessed in Britain in the first
half of this year, double the number in the last half of 1989,
according to the Council of Mortgage lenders.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been especially proud of the increasing rate
of home ownership in Britain under her leadership, and newspaper
pictures of evicted families are bad news for a government facing
an election by mid-1992.
   Not only are interest rates high, said council spokesman Adrian
Coles, but unemployment is creeping up, from 5.7 percent in July to
5.8 percent in August. Retail sales were down 1.6 percent in the
same period.
   The Institute of Directors said nearly three-quarters of the 200
members surveyed in August said they were less optimistic about the
economy and company prospects than six months ago, an increase of
27 percentage points since June.
   The accounting firm Touche Ross and Co. says 2,365 businesses
failed in Britain between January and August, compared with 866
over the same period a year ago. Manufacturing, retailing and
construction businesses were the most frequent casualties, it said.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said Friday that the
government is committed to its policy of high interest rates. The
rates will remain high until it's safe to lower them, he said.
   Economic growth is expected to shrink to 1.2 percent this year,
from 2.1 percent in 1989 and 4.7 percent in 1988, says the London
investment firm James Capel and Co.
   John Banham, director general of the employers group, the
Confederation of British Industry, said: ``Businessmen do not
question the need to tackle the inflationary malaise. But a
full-scale recession ... is not the answer.''
   Lawrence Curtis, a partner in the Anthony W. Peake jewelry store
in Maidstone, said sales have been good but profits have been pared
by rising mortgage costs on the shop premises.
   ``It's a difference between making a living and making a
profit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bumper Corn Crop May Boost Livestock Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big 1990 corn crop may provide a strong
boost to the nation's livestock industry - the ranchers, farmers
and feedlot operators who turn out beef and pork for consumers.
   According to Agriculture Department economists, the price of
corn is going to be substantially less than they had forecast a
month ago. That will mean some easing of feed costs from what had
been expected.
   But lower corn prices will mean lower profits for farmers who
produce grain for sale on the market.
   ``A lot of it may be whose ox is getting gored,'' said Leland
Southard of the department's Economic Research Service. ``It's
going to be positive, I think, for livestock.''
   Last week USDA estimated this fall's corn harvest at 8.12
billion bushels, up 3 percent from prospects a month earlier and 8
percent more than last year's crop.
   Projections on supply and demand for corn during the 1990-91
marketing year that began Sept. 1 point to total use - including
domestic and export demand - of about 4.7 billion bushels, up from
4.5 billion in 1989-90.
   It is also 100 million bushels more than the agency forecast in
August that would be used in the coming year.
   As a result of the bumper harvest - corn yields per acre were
estimated at a record high of 121.7 bushels - prices at the farm
are expected to decline to a range of $2.10 to $2.50 per bushel in
1990-91.
   That would be down 25 cents a bushel from the August forecast
and probably below the average 1989-90 price of $2.38 per bushel.
   Southard, in a telephone interview a day after the Sept. 12 crop
report, said he had previously forecast a 3 percent increase in
pork production next year but that uncertainty still clouded the
plans of producers.
   ``I would certainly expect a little more expansion now'' that
the 1990 corn crop is shaping up so large, he said.
   Farmers and ranchers who have cow-calf operations, which form
the foundation of the nation's beef industry, may settle on ``a
more active herd expansion'' because of the general outlook and,
particularly, the prospect of moderating feed costs, Southard said.
   ``In the short run, that tends to take away from beef
production, but then increases it in the longer run,'' he said.
   That is because beef cattle have a much longer biological cycle
than hogs and poultry. Thus, when heifers are retained for breeding
herds, it means fewer animals for the slaughter market - and less
beef.
   Eventually, the calves produced by the heifers will grow up and
be added to the nation's beef output.

   Rising food costs, lower rebates for infant
formula and more poor people mean Congress will have to provide
more money than originally anticipated to fully fund the women and
infant feeding program, says the Congressional Budget Office.
   The WIC program never has been funded sufficiently to cover all
the eligible women and babies, but it was generally believed that
to do so would cost about $150 million more each year. The House
has appropriated a total of $2.32 billion for fiscal 1991.
   The CBO estimates that $285 million more would be needed to get
participation to 85 percent, which is considered full funding. For
many years participation has been about 50 percent of those
eligible.
   The budget office estimates the following increments would be
needed for future years: $319 million for 1992; $358 million, 1993;
$400 million, 1994; $446 million, 1995.
   The WIC program provides monthly food packages or food vouchers
to low-income women, infants and children whose health is at risk
because of poor nutrition. Pregnant women, breast feeding mothers,
babies and children under five whose family income is less than
specific poverty guidelines are eligible.
   CBO estimates that there will 8.7 million eligible people in
1991. WIC is an Agriculture Department program administered by the
states.

   The Agriculture Department says the tiny
island Republic of Malta offers an opportunity for enterprising
food exporters. Nothing huge, mind you, Malta is less than twice
the size of the District of Columbia.
   But the Mediterranean island produces only 40 percent of the
food needs for its 350,000 inhabitants and thriving tourist trade.
   Only about $9 million worth of U.S. products were imported last
year, says a report in the October issue of AgExporter magazine.
Still, Maltese importers have ``expressed a keen interest'' in
buying a wide variety of U.S. agricultural products.
   These include packaged rice, popcorn, peanut butter, dried
fruits, walnuts, in-shell peanuts, breakfast cereals, soybean meal
and alfalfa.
   However, according to U.S. agricultural officer Stan M. Cohen,
who is stationed in Milan, Italy, ``taking advantage of this
interest may require some flexibility'' on the part of exporters.
   For example, many of the Maltese orders are for such small
quantities that they will not fill up a standard 20-foot shipping
container, thus requiring the shipment of mixed containers, the
report said.
   Also, since there is no direct shipping service between the
United Sates and Malta, cargoes must be routed through North
European ports, meaning a transit time of six to eight week.

<HEAD>Israelis Generally Pleased at Growing Ties to Moscow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Israelis are praising the weekend meeting
of two Cabinet ministers with Mikhail S. Gorbachev as opening new
horizons of diplomacy and trade, but some question Moscow's
motives.
   ``It changes our international map,'' said Gideon Raphael, a
veteran Israeli diplomat.
   He witnessed the departure from Israel of the Soviets and their
East bloc satellites 23 years ago, and he's now happily watching
them trickle back.
   The Soviet leader met for 2{ hours Saturday in Moscow with
Israeli Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Science Minister Yuval
Neeman.
   It was the highest-level encounter ever between Soviets and
Israelis, and the most significant since Moscow severed diplomatic
ties with Jerusalem in June 1967.
   At an airport news conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the two
ministers said they were carrying a personal message from the
Soviet president to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. They did not
describe its contents.
   They disclosed little of their talks with Gorbachev but said
they focused on the Persian Gulf crisis and possible trade deals,
including agriculture and oil.
   The meeting was hailed by some Israeli foreign policy analysts.
   Raphael said the Soviets had over the years plunged Israel into
a diplomatic no man's land that stretched ``from the Berlin Wall to
the Chinese Wall.'' They had armed the Arabs, equated Zionism with
Nazism, and persecuted Soviet Jews who wished to emigrate.
   ``Now this no man's land has become smaller,'' he said in an
interview.
   Commented the daily newspaper Haaretz: ``Had anyone dared a year
ago to prophesy what would happen this weekend in Moscow, he would
have brought nothing but mockery upon himself. ... It shows that no
political situation, however unchangeable it looks, exists
forever.''
   Saturday's meeting was unannounced beforehand. Modai and Neeman
left without fanfare, sidestepping protocol. Their visit was
arranged by a Soviet Jewish immigrant, Ilya Zemtsov, an aide to
eeman.
   Modai said Sunday that the talks with Gorbachev ``covered wide
possibilities of imports and exports,'' including the idea of
building a Soviet-U.S.-Israeli passenger plane.
   Asked about a possible exchange of Soviet oil for Israeli
agricultural products, Modai said it was ``a successful guess, but
at this stage only a guess.''
   Modai said that Israel, faced with the prospect of absorbing 1
million Soviet Jews over the next few years, needed ``a
breakthrough in agricultural exports.''
   The talks, which also covered diplomatic issues, came as Moscow
and Jerusalem find themselves in the same camp for the first time
since the 1950s by dint of their opposition to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   The meeting in Moscow happened to coincide with Secretary of
State James A Baker III's talks with President Hafez Assad of
Syria.
   The Soviets used to be Syria's main military backer; indeed, it
was that alliance that helped trigger the 1967 Middle East War and,
in turn, the Soviets' diplomatic rupture with Israel.
   Now that Soviet arms are no longer guaranteed to Syria, Israeli
attitudes are changing, too.
   However, not everyone was euphoric about Saturday's meeting.
   Sovietologist Mikhail Agursky of Hebrew University said in an
interview that he believes Gorbachev won't last and that ``to bet
on Gorbachev is to bet on a dead horse.''
   The daily newspaper Davar argued that Soviet overtures to Israel
are motivated by the old anti-Semitic canard about Jews bent on
world domination.
   ``They are convinced that Jewish control of world, and above all
American capital, can channel enterprise and investments their
way,'' it editorialized.
   Unlike East European countries, the Soviet Union has yet to take
what in Israel's view is the ultimate step - re-establishing full
diplomatic ties.

<HEAD>Democrats See Gulf Crisis Stealing The Spotlight In 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jim Ruvolo feels the frustration of Democrats
who thought the party had the best of the issues going into the
1990 campaign. And then Saddam Hussein decided to overrun Kuwait.
   ``There's this big screen between the voters and information and
that screen is Iraq,'' said Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic
Party.
   For two days, Democrats met in Washington this weekend and tried
to define a campaign that so far has been overshadowed by public
interest in the Persian Gulf.
   Like their Republican counterparts, the Democrats profess to
lack a clear signal of what impact the Middle East crisis will have
on individual contests this fall.
   The odds are that very few of the races will be decided by what
voters are thinking about Iraq. But the Persian Gulf is making it
far more difficult for candidates to get the attention of voters.
   The savings and loan industry scandal was an issue the Democrats
thought would work for them in 1990.
   ``People are angry,'' said Ruvolo. ``And they blame Republicans
more than Democrats'' for a crisis that leaves them uneasy about
their personal savings and that appears certain to boost the
federal deficit.
   ``But now that's faded into the background,'' he said.
   Ronald H. Brown, the national party chairman, tried to set a
campaign tone for his party with a speech that expressed unwavering
support for the U.S. commitment in the Persian Gulf while sharply
criticizing Republican domestic policies.
   Brown referred to a ``Republican recession'' and said Bush
wanted to push through another tax cut for the wealthiest
Americans. He castigated the president for failing to develop an
energy policy that would make the nation less dependent on Middle
East oil and said the S&amp;L crisis was the result of ``see-nothing
Republican justice.''
   But Brown steered clear of other domestic issues he apparently
felt would not work to the advantage of his party's candidates.
   The Democrats refused to act on a proposal to put them on record
as flatly opposing any tax increase to help balance the budget. It
was only months ago that Bush was forced to abandon that ground,
much to the distress of many Republicans, and Brown had no desire
to occupy it.
   ``We'll accept the president's call for tax increases,'' said
Brown, ``but we'll not go gently when he tries to cut taxes for the
richest Americans yet again.''
   Not a word was uttered on the nomination of David Souter to the
Supreme Court. After two days of testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee, in which he refused to say whether he might
vote to overturn the decision legalizing most abortions, Souter
appears certain to win confirmation from the Senate.
   ``I have great confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committee,''
was as far as Brown would go when asked about the nomination.
   When pressed as to hw he would vote on the nomination, Brown
gave a lawyerly answer: ``I think I'd like to see the full hearing
and make a judgment on what he said in response to questions.''
   No one was willing to guess what might happen in the Persian
Gulf between now and Election Day. The most anyone would speculate
was that the situation would remain pretty much the same with
American forces in Saudi Arabia and Iraq hanging tough in Kuwait.
   ``I think he (Bush) has six or eight months of goodwill on this
thing,'' said Ruvolo. Beyond that, he said, the president might
face growing questions as to why U.S. troops were remaining in the
Saudi desert.

   Here is the text of President Bush's address
to the people of Iraq, as released by the White House:
   I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United
States and the world community has responded the way it has to
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. My purpose is not to trade
accusations, not to escalate the war of words, but to speak with
candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us. Let
there be no misunderstanding. We have no quarrel with the people of
Iraq. I've said many times, and I will repeat right now, our only
object is to oppose the invasion ordered by Saddam Hussein.
   On August 2nd, your leadership made its decision to invade, an
unprovoked attack on a small nation that posed no threat to your
own. Kuwait was the victim; Iraq, the aggressor.
   And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation,
unanimous resolutions in the United Nations. Twenty-seven states,
rich and poor, Arab, Muslim, Asian and African, have answered the
call of Saudi Arabia and free Kuwait and sent forces to the Gulf
region to defend against Iraq. For the first time in history, 13
states of the Arab League, representing 80 percent of the Arab
Nation, have condemned a brother Arab state. Today, opposed by
world opinion, Iraq stands isolated and alone.
   I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war. You've
borne untold suffering and hardship during eight long years of war
with Iran. A war that touched the life of every single Iraqi
citizen. A war that took the lives of hundreds of thousands of
young men, the bright promise of an entire generation. No one knows
better than you the incalculable costs of war, the ultimate cost
when a nation's vast potential and vital energies are consumed by
conflict. No one knows what Iaq might be today, what prosperity
and peace you might enjoy had your leaders not plunged you into
war.
   Now, once again, Iraq finds itself on the brink of war. Once
again, the same Iraqi leadership has miscalculated. Once again, the
Iraqi people face tragedy.
   Saddam Hussein has told you that Iraqi troops were invited into
Kuwait. That's not true. In fact, in the face of far superior
force, the people of Kuwait are bravely resisting this occupation.
Your own returning soldiers will tell you the Kuwaitis are fighting
valiantly in any way they can.
   Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between
Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world. When
President Gorbachev and I met at Helsinki we agreed that no
peaceful international order is possible if larger states can
devour their neighbors. Never before has world opinion been so
solidly united against aggression.
   Nor, until the invasion of Kuwait, has the United States been
opposed to Iraq. In the past, the United States has helped Iraq
import billions of dollars worth of food and other commodities. And
the war with Iran would not have ended two years ago without U.S.
support and sponsorship in the United Nations.
   Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit
the poorer nations of the world. In fact, the occupation of Kuwait
is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and
countless others of the world's poor. Instead of acquiring new oil
wells by annexing Kuwait, this misguided act of aggression will
cost Iraq over $20 billion a year in lost oil revenues. Because of
Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign
workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq. They are stranded on Iraq's
borders, without shelter, without food, without medicine, with no
way home. These refugees are suffering, and this is shameful.
   But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and
Kuwait. Hostage taking punishes the innocent and separates
families. It is barbaric. It will not work. And it will not affect
my ability to make tough decisions.
   I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq. The
United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish
the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your
leadership to withdraw from Kuwait. That decision is in the hands
of Saddam Hussein.
   The pain you now experience is a direct result of the path your
leadership has chosen. When Iraq returns to the path of peace, when
Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, when that country's rightful
government is restored, when all foreigners held against their will
are released, then, and then alone will the world end the
sanctions.
   Perhaps your leaders do not appreciate the strength of the
forces united against them. Let me say clearly, there is no way
Iraq can win. Ultimately, Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.
   No one - not the American people, not this president - wants
war. But there are times when a country, when all countries who
value the principles of sovereignty and independence, must stand
against aggression. As Americans, we're slow to raise our hand in
anger and eager to explore every peaceful means of settling our
disputes. But when we have exhausted every alternative, when
conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earth with
greater resolve or stronger steadiness of purpose.
   The actions of your leadership have put Iraq at odds with the
world community. But while those actions have brought us to the
brink of conflict, war is not inevitable. It is still possible to
bring this crisis to a peaceful end.
   When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a
principle well understood in the Arab world. Let me quote the words
of one Arab leader - Saddam Hussein himself: ``An Arab country does
not have the right to occupy another Arab country. God forbid, if
Iraq should deviate from the right path, we would want Arabs to
send their armies to put things right. If Iraq should become
intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another Arab state,
the Arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it.''
   Those are the words of your leader, Saddam Hussein, spoken on
Nov. 28, 1988, in a speech to Arab lawyers. Today, two years later,
Saddam has invaded and occupied a member of the United Nations and
the Arab League. The world will not allow this aggression to stand.
Iraq must get out of Kuwait for ,the sake of principle, for the
sake of peace, and for the sake of the Iraqi people.

   The childless couple and the young
woman struck a bargain: Mark and Crispina Calvert would give Anna
Johnson $10,000, and she would bear a child created from their egg
and sperm.
   The deal went wrong. Now, just weeks before the birth, the
Calverts and Ms. Johnson are locked in a bitter custody dispute
that is moving from the TV talk show arena into the courtroom.
   Lawyers for the three sides - the fetus has a court-appointed
attorney - are preparing their strategies in a case called
unprecedented even in the cutting-edge realm of surrogate
pregnancies.
   The issues: What makes a parent - the genetic link or the act of
bearing a child? And what is the legality of the surrogate
contract?
   The outcome, experts say, could be a groundbreaking ruling or a
narrow decision that doesn't go beyond that of any other custody
case. A pre-trial hearing is set for Thursday in Superior Court.
   Harold LaFlamme, the fetus' attorney, said his goal is to avoid
protracted litigation and an unstable life for the child. A narrow
ruling based on the child's best interests is possible, he said.
   California courts ``try to avoid constitutional disputes, try to
fit cases into the family law scheme of things,'' he said.
   H. Joseph Gitlin, head of the surrogacy committee of the
American Bar Association's family law section, agreed that the
child's interests may outweigh other issues. But if Ms. Johnson is
found to lack a genetic link to the child, ``that surely gives the
(Calverts) a leg up,'' he said.
   California's liberal track record in family law - giving the
nation such concepts as no-fault divorce - makes it more likely
that the surrogate contract will be upheld, Gitlin said.
   But even if the contract is ruled invalid, ``I see the court
deciding the case on the same basis as the Baby M case: That is, in
the best interests of the child,'' he said.
   In that landmark New Jersey case, the child was conceived by a
surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, with the sperm of a man
whose wife couldn't have a baby. Whitehead reneged on the
arrangement, prompting a bitter custody fight that was won in 1988
by the father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth. The judge
ruled the contract invalid and awarded them the baby.
   However, in that case, Ms. Whitehead was genetically the child's
mother because she provided the egg. In the California case, the
Calverts agreed to provide both sperm and egg for a so-called
test-tube baby.
   Complicating the California case is a claim from Ms. Johnson's
attorneys that the fetus might be her natural child. And because
one of Ms. Johnson's grandparents is American Indian, the child's
adoption could involve federal tribal-protection laws that give
preference to Indians. Calvert, 34, is white and his wife Filipino.
   Mrs. Calvert, 36, and Ms. Johnson, 29, met at the Santa Ana
hospital where both worked as nurses. Ms. Johnson agreed to undergo
an embryo transplant for the Calverts for $10,000.
   Mrs. Calvert was unable to conceive a child naturally because of
a hysterectomy. A single parent with a 3-year-old daughter, Ms.
Johnson said she had seen the contract as a way to put herself
through graduate nursing school.
   But Ms. Johnson claims the couple's enthusiasm for the pregnancy
turned to indifference, they were late with payments and showed no
concern when she suffered complications. She is seeking custody,
child support and emotional damages.
   The Calverts deny the allegations, accusing Ms. Johnson of greed
and publicity-seeking. The dispute has been aired by both sides on
such TV shows as ``Geraldo'' and ``Donahue.''
   The couple's attorney, Christian Van Deusen, said he will ask
the court to enforce the custody rights detailed in the contract
and to recognize the genetic relationship in determining
parenthood.
   Ms. Johnson's attorneys, Richard Gilbert and Diane Marlowe, say
they will seek to have the contract declared illegal and invalid
because it constitutes baby-selling. California has no law on the
issue.
   They maintain that Ms. Johnson is the biological parent because
she is carrying the child to term, and that the transplant may not
have even succeeded. State law recognizes the birth mother as the
legal mother, they say.

   Here at a glance is what has occurred so far
at the budget summit between Bush administration and congressional
negotiators. The talks at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
entered their ninth day Sunday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE PACKAGE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both sides want to reduce next year's deficit by $50 billion and
shrink the budget gap by $500 billion over five years. They agree
that about half the first-year savings should come from new taxes
and fees, the rest from spending cuts.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE CUTS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats want $11 billion next year, $200 billion over five
years. Republicans want about $10 billion next year, $170 billion
over five years. Not considered a major problem.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOMESTIC PROGRAMS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats willing to reduce them by about $103 billion over five
years, Republicans want to go to at least $120 billion. Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is
said to be stubbornly resisting further cuts. A sticking point.
   On Sunday, Democrats moved away from $30 billion in reductions
to benefits programs the two sides had discussed, making the
problem more serious.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES AND FEES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both sides want about $25 billion for next year, but they
disagree on components. Republicans want to cut the capital gains
tax rate. Democrats say they won't agree unless income taxes on the
wealthy are increased as compensation. This is a major problem.
   Democrats have proposed boosting gasoline taxes 11 cents per
gallon, putting a 4 percent tax on other energy and increasing
taxes the well-to-do pay to support Medicare.
   Republicans want to tax almost all petroleum products a penny a
gallon, limit the deductibility of state and local income taxes,
and let many excise taxes increase with inflation.
   Both sides have proposed increasing taxes on cigarettes; on
luxury items such as expensive automobiles, yachts and jewelry; and
on chemicals that remove ozone from the atmosphere.
   Other problems: Republicans want to limit Congress' ability to
increase spending in future years. Democrats are resisting. This is
also a major hurdle.

<HEAD>The Border Opened, Kuwaitis Stream Out With Grim Tales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwaitis fleeing through a suddenly
opened border crossing say food is becoming scarcer in their
homeland and Iraqi soldiers are trying to quell resistance by
blowing up blocks of houses.
   Their government-in-exile called the unannounced weekend exodus
of several thousand Kuwaitis - the first allowed by Iraq in about a
month - evidence that Iraq's Saddam Hussein intends to depopulate
Kuwait and move in his own people.
   One refugee, the 45-year-old owner of an investment company,
said ``people are not obeying them (the Iraqis) so they want to get
rid of us.''
   Iraqi soldiers confiscated all identity documents, including car
registrations, from those leaving the oil-rich emirate, refugees
said. They said the Iraqis apparently wanted to make it difficult
for anyone to return.
   No precise tally was available on the number of refugees who had
crossed into Saudi Arabia at Khafji since word spread in Kuwait on
Friday that Iraq was lifting restrictions on departure through the
border post, the only official crossing between the countries.
   In addition to the several thousand Kuwaitis who apparently made
the journey, refugees included a Yugoslav woman maried to a
Kuwaiti and about 20 Asians, Saudi officials said.
   They said they were too overwhelmed with paperwork to give exact
figures.
   The Iraqis had not announced the border opening. The refugees
learned of it by word of mouth and could only speculate on the
reasoning behind it.
   The Kuwaiti Cabinet discussed the development in an emergency
meeting Sunday in the southwestern resort of Taif, where the
government-in-exile has established its headquarters.
   Afterward, it issued a statement saying the border opening
reflected a new Iraqi policy of ``getting the Kuwaitis out after
stripping them of their identity papers, and bringing in Iraqis to
settle in Kuwait.''
   Kuwaiti leaders have previously accused Saddam of intending to
eventually repopulate Kuwait with Iraqis.
   On Sunday, Mercedes, Chevrolet Suburban jeeps and scores of
other expensive cars stretched 500 yards from the checkpoint as
Saudi border police checked vehicles and demanded some
identification.
   ``There's just too many of them to handle. It's a very slow
procedure getting them through because they have no documents,''
said a Western diplomat stationed at the border to monitor the
traffic.
   A committee of Kuwaitis at the border screened refugees, asking
questions about such things as membership in local organizations.
Saudi officials have expressed concern the Iraqis opened the border
to sneak in spies and terrorists.
   Some refugees said they had received news of the border opening
in anonymous telephone calls.
   A 33-year-old journalist said a friend got a call saying: ``Why
do you always talk badly about Saddam Hussein? The border's open,
why don't you leave?''
   Like many fleeing, he was afraid to give his name for fear that
the Iraqis might harm relatives left behind.
   ``It's a rough life now,'' the journalist said. ``They're
blowing up houses, killing people for any suspicion.''
   Kuwaitis said the Iraqis have blown up or burned up to 20 houses
at a time in neighborhoods where Iraqi soldiers were killed by
resistance fighters.
   The Iraqis also were sealing off whole neighborhoods to conduct
house-to-house searches, looking for resistance material and the
several hundred Westerners still reported in hiding, the refugees
said.
   They said the sound of gunfire could be heard during the curfew
hours of 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.
   Saddam's troops have plundered most public property - carting
off everything from hospital machinery to street lights - but have
generally stayed out of Kuwaiti homes.
   ``Now they want to make a super robbery in Kuwait - take
everything,'' said 35-year-old Salam Matouk, another refugee.
   An estimated 300,000 of Kuwait's native population of 570,000
have fled since Iraq invaded on Aug. 2. Most are in Saudi Arabia,
where the government pays for their housing and food.
   Only Kuwaitis working in essential services like electricity and
water plants are at their jobs, refugees reported. Kuwait's police
officers have ignored an order to return to work, and no one has
registered for the announced Oct. 1 opening of schools.
   Stocks of food are getting low and cash short, the refugees
said.
   But staples are still available, and small quantities of
vegetables are brought in by Palestinian traders allowed to go to
Iraq's southern port city of Basra, they said.
   The refugees bitterly criticized the Palestinians - thousands of
whom work as professionals or merchants in Kuwait - for
collaborating with Iraqi authorities to root out former soldiers
and policemen.
   Many Palestinians in Jordan and elsewhere have supported Iraq in
its occupation of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Diplomats Say Anti-Iraq Sanctions Likely To Be Extended To Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angered by Iraqi raids on the French and
other diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, U.N. representatives say
they're considering extending to air corridors the international
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   On Sunday, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution
condemning Iraq for violating diplomatic territory with Friday's
raids and warning that further sanctions were likely if Baghdad
continued to ignore U.N. resolutions.
   The U.S. ambassador, Thomas R. Pickering, said another
resolution would be drafted to impose an air embargo, a step the
United Nations has never taken against a nation.
   An air blockade would involve the interception of planes
approaching Iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering
hostilities than the boarding ships in the Persian Gulf, which has
been done under the U.N. naval embargo.
   ``By singling out diplomatic missions for attack, Iraq confirms
its preference for instruments of force to instruments of diplomacy
and negotiation,'' Pickering said.
   Western diplomats say sanctions are also planned against nations
that break the embargo the U.N. imposed on trade with Iraq after
Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The ambassadors of the Security Council's five permanent members
- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union -
met at the French Mission on Sunday to begin laying the groundwork
for further resolutions.
   Pickering and other diplomats said they expected a vote by the
end of the week.
   ``If Iraq persists, there will be other resolutions,'' Soviet
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov said. ``The cumulative effect will
produce the necessary result, a political solution, a solution
without any kind of military activity.''
   President Francois Mittrrand of France said Saturday that his
country wants the United Nations to widen the embargo on Iraq to
include air traffic and punishment of countries or companies
violating the sanctions.
   The swift move on the air embargo indicated how seriously the
Western world views Iraq's storming of the French, Belgian, Dutch
and Canadian compounds, the detention of diplomats and seizing of
three Frenchmen.
   Iraq attacked the resolution as part of a ``vicious hostile
campaign led by the United States and its allies.''
   ``Iraq categorically rejects that it had kidnapped foreigners
from former diplomatic premises or is holding them as hostages,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a report by the Iraqi News
Agency.
   Work on the new resolutions began hours after the council, in an
emergency session sought by France, voted 15-0 early Sunday to
condemn Iraq for its storming of embassy compounds.
   The resolution was the seventh adopted overwhelmingly by the
council to deal with the crisis sparked by Iraq's lightning
invasion and annexation of the oil-rich emirate.
   The four embassies raided were among some 17 that have remained
open in Kuwait in defiance of an Iraqi order to close. Iraq cut
utilities to many embassies and surrounded missions with troops to
force diplomats to leave.
   The Iraqi government considers Kuwait a province of Iraq and
says the 1961 Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular
relations do not apply. Those treaties set forth the inviolability
of diplomatic compounds.
   In its latest resolution, the council said it ``strongly
condemns aggressive acts perpetrated by Iraq against diplomatic
premises and personnel in Kuwait as well as the abduction of
foreign nationals who were present in those premises.''
   It demanded the immediate release of all foreign nationals.
   Although Iraq has allowed Western women and children to leave,
many men have been sent to strategic sites to serve as shields
against potential attack by U.S.-led forces.
   An air embargo would require cooperation from Iraq's neighbors.
They would have to close their air space to Iraq-bound flights,
refuse refueling to planes headed for Iraq and report suspicious
flights to the Security Council's sanctions committee.
   State Department officials say privately that the few flights
now going into Baghdad are not considered a threat to the integrity
of the embargo, and that it would be impossible for Iraq to
effectively break the sanctions with airlifts.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
177.62 points Friday, shed another 531.865 points, or 2.13 percent,
to close at 24,365.60.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds continued to rise. They were quoted at
8.570 percent at 3:00 p.m. after Friday's 8.460-percent close, the
highest yield the bond has ever reached. The price was lower at
81.17 points from 81.62.
   The dollar closed at 137.00 yen, up 0.45 yen from Friday's close
of 136.55 yen. After opening lower at 136.45 yen, the currency
ranged between 136.43 yen and 137.10 yen.
   The yen fell against the U.S. and European currencies as
investors sold the yen in an attempt to correct overbought
positions, said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan
Securities Co. The dollar started lower following its downtrend in
the Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo.
   ``Institutional investors had bought the yen and sold
substantial amounts of European and U.S. currencies before their
settling their accounts for the first half of fiscal 1990,'' he
said.
   On Monday, such investors bought the dollar at around 136.40 to
136.50 yen to make up their short, or oversold, positions, he said.
   ``Weakness in the bond and the stock market also contributed to
the yen's weakness,'' Kanai said.
   But he said the Japanese currency's weakness Monday is just a
brief correction.
   On the stock exchange, traders said the index fell as soon as
the market opened because investors discouraged by the weakening
government bond market and began index-linked large-scale selling.
   They also said announcement of a price increase by major oil
wholesalers also discouraged investors.

<TEXT>
   A toddler who was trapped for 14 hours in a
12-foot shaft at his parents' new home popped out ``like Superman''
after a firefighter crawling on his belly through a rescue tunnel
grasped the boy's hand.
   Twenty-month-old Kevin Davis was released from a hospital with
little more than a scraped elbow Sunday after being treated for
dehydration.
   Kevin listened to his mother sing nursery songs and busied
himself rolling mud balls as rescuers dug a parallel hole to the
shaft and then tunneled over to the boy, who had fallen in on
Saturday afternoon.
   ``I could hear him crying, but I couldn't touch him and I
couldn't help him,'' said his mother, Lisa Davis, fighting back
tears at a news conference at Denver General Hospital. ``It was
really difficult.''
   Kevin fell to the bottom of the shaft dug for a remodeling
project at the home. The family was not living there at the time.
``He managed to slip under a piece of wood and fell into the hole.
I heard him bouncing around,'' Mrs. Davis said.
   Lying on their stomachs, firefighters Kevin Duncan and Joe Cipri
used their hands to dig the last few feet of the second tunnel
before reaching the boy shortly after 6 a.m. Sunday.
   Cipri said when he placed his hands near Kevin, the toddler's
``little hands just grabbed my fingers. He just kind of flew out of
there like Superman.''
   Firefighters worked through the night to keep Kevin warm and
dry, pumping oxygen into the hole and shining halogen lights to
keep the temperature at about 70 degrees.
   Workers dug a vertical rescue shaft using a huge truck-mounted
pipeline excavator that uses a stream of compressed air to chisel
away dirt and clay and then vacuums out the loose dirt.
   ``He was in a daze, his diaper hanging off, just kind of looking
at us like `What's happening here?' '' Duncan said. ``When he
clinched my fingers, I felt a tingle in my heart. It's still
there.''
   After Kevin was safe, Cipri said, ``I just laid there for awhile
in that tunnel enjoying the roar outside. It was just great. This
is what you get on the fire department for.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Mary Lee Chin said Kevin had only a scrape
on his elbow.
   The boy's father, Tom Davis, admitted he had not obtained the
necessary building permits for work being done at the home. No
charges were immediately filed.

   News and advertising employees at the New York
Post vote tonight on whether the nation' oldest daily will live or
die.
   Owner Peter Kalikow says if members of The Newspaper Guild don't
agree to a four-day week - less one day's pay - he will close
immediately, putting 960 people out of work. The
505,000-circulation paper is losing $27 million a year.
   On Friday, 10 unions at the paper known for its screaming
headlines agreed to $19 million in concessions. Guild negotiators
rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but the guild president endorsed it
and decided to let the members decide.
   The union's 352 editorial and advertising workers vote on
whether to accept a 20 percent pay cut and the elimination of 43
jobs.
   Punctuated by a big question mark and a picture of the presses,
the front page headline today was possibly the 189-year-old
newspaper's last: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN AGAIN?''
   Editor Jerry Nachman in today's edition was asked how he would
feel if the Post folded. ``How did the captain of the Titanic
feel?'' he asked.
   ``I think we will get through this tonight because the
alternative is unthinkable,'' Nachman said.
   ``It's more than a job,'' said a 23{-year composing room veteran
who declined to give his name as he arrived at work Sunday. ``It's
part of your life. It's part of the life of the city.''
   If the Post lives, workers will get 20 percent of company stock
and a representative on the board of directors, union leaders said.
   Kalikow bought the money-losing tabloid from media baron Rupert
Murdoch two years ago after wringing $24 million in concesssions
from the unions.
   As Kalikow's Friday evening deadline for reaching agreement on
still more concessions approached, the Post braced for the worst
and reportedly readied the headline: ``BANG, WE'RE DEAD.''
   ``AIN'T OVER YET!'' the Post trumpeted Saturday.
   Alexander Hamilton founded the newspaper in 1801. His was the
first of many famous names associated with the Post. In the 1820s,
New England poet William Cullen Bryant began a 50-year tenure as
editor. Walt Whitman covered the Civil War for the Post. Franklin
D. Roosevelt was briefly a co-owner in the 1920s.
   Heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939. While other New
York papers withered and died the Post profited under Schiff's
politically liberal format and tight budgeting. But its fortunes
dimmed in the 1970s as much of its audience moved to the suburbs
and it lost $500,000 annually.
   Schiff sold it in 1976 to Murdoch for $31 million. Murdoch
turned the Post politically conservative and into a steamy tabloid
with sexy pictures, racy headlines - ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS
BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime stories.
   Murdoch said he lost $150 million on the Post before selling it
for $37 million in 1988 to Kalikow.

   Israel has appointed Yoram Aridor, a former
finance minister who has never held a diplomatic post, as its
ambassador to the United Nations.
   Aridor, 57, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, received the necessary Cabinet approval on
Sunday, a spokesman for Shamir's office said.
   The Foreign Ministry said Aridor will assume his post later this
month after the opening of the General Assembly in New York. He
will replace acting Ambassador Yochanan Bein, who will remain part
of Israel's U.N. delegation.
   The Israeli-born Aridor was named finance minister in 1981
during triple-digit inlation. He was forced to resign in 1983
after he backed an unpopular plan to tie the Israeli shekel to the
dollar.
   A supporter of Foreign Minister David Levy, Aridor rose with
Levy through Likud ranks after joining the party in the 1960s.
   He was educated at Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he
studied economics and political science. He also has a law degree.
He is married and has three children.

   The dollar retreated against all key currencies in
European trading this morning. Gold prices were higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.00 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Friday's close. Later, in London, the dollar fell to 136.82 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9055, compared

   TV's top-rated dad is also its highest-paid one,
as Bill Cosby knocked Michael Jackson out of first place on Forbes'
list of the world's 40 richest entertainers with two-year earnings
projected at $115 million.
   Jackson, who had been No. 1 for two years straight, hasn't put
out an album or gone on tour this year but still made more money
than any other singer or musical group - a two-year estimate of
$100 million. He was ranked No. 2.
   Jackson's singing sister Janet was a newcomer to Forbes' list.
She ranked 26th with estimated two-year earnings of $30 million,
the magazine said in its Oct. 1 issue, released today.
   Cosby made $60 million last year, and Forbes projected he would
earn $55 million this year.
   The Rolling Stones - with $88 million - rose to third place from
eighth last year thanks largely to a big concert tour. Movie
producer-director Steven Spielberg, whose ``Arachnophobia'' was a
box-office success this summer, made $87 million. He slipped to
fourth place from second.
   New entrants on the list were the teeny-bopper sensation New
Kids on the Block in fifth place. Forbes said the group would make
$78 million in the two years, $61 million of it in 1990.
   Forbes said the estimated gross incomes were based on talks with
industry executives, lawyers, agents and managers.
   It said earnings figures for recording artists are based on
royalty payments from record and video sales and estimated pretax
gross for concert tours.
   Rounding out the top 10 were Oprah Winfrey, $68 million;
Sylvester Stallone, $63 million; Madonna, $62 million; Arnold
Schwarzenegger, $55 million, and ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles M.
Schulz, $54 million.
   Newcomers to the list included Paul McCartney, with an estimated
income of $45 million; Bruce Willis, star of the two ``Die Hard''
movies and of the December release ``Bonfire of the Vanities,''
based on the Tom Wolfe novel, at $36 million, and Sean Connery, who
starred in ``The Hunt for Red October,'' at $35 million.

   Hurricane Marie weakened to a tropical
depression but kicked up the surf at Hawaii today. The approaching
storm prompted the Navy to suspend efforts to raise from the
Pacific a door that blew off a jumbo jet.
   The storm was downgraded late Sunday after it winds fell from 80
mph to 70 mph, below the 75 mph hurricane threshold. Marie was 320
miles east-southeast of Hilo, heading for Hawaii at 10 mph, said
forecaster Tim Craig.
   Waves generated by Marie began hitting Hawaii, known as the Big
Island, Sunday evening and were expected to rise up to 10 feet by
early today.
   Authorities issued a high surf advisory Sunday and said all
ocean and beach activities should be halted. Gale force winds,
which range from 39 mph to 54 mph, extended 75 miles from the
center of the storm, Craig said.
   If the storm continued on its track, its center would pass about
40 miles south of the island at midday Tuesday, when its winds were
expected to be about 35 mph, Craig said.
   Because of the storm, the Navy suspended efforts to recover the
door that tore off a United Airlines flight last year, hurling nine
people to their deaths.
   The minisub Sea Cliff returned to Pearl Harbor on Sunday after
Navy officials decided seas 90 miles south-southwest of Honolulu
were too rough to make a second 2{-mile dive to the ocean floor,
Lt. Cmdr. Sandy Stairs said.
   The cargo door and part of the fuselage ripped off the Boeing
747 as it cruised at 22,000 feet in 1989.
   The Navy hoped to return to the site later this week, she said.

   Rain fell in Boston early today and there was fog in New
Orleans. Elsewhere, skies were mostly clear.
   Gusty winds from the northwest were expected to bring showers to
New England today, with highs only in the 50s and 60s. A mixture of
sun and clouds was predicted for the remainder of the East, with
thundershowers possible in Florida.
   Sunshine was expected in the South and Midwest, while a storm
system was forming from Oklahoma to South Dakota, thanks to a
stretch of humid coming in from the Gulf.
   The West looked sunny skies, with a large high pressure system
covering the region, except for some showers in Idaho, Montana and
western Colorado.
   Temperatures were expected to be in the 70s for the Middle
Atlantic states, the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes, in the
80s for the Plains and the Rockies, the 90s for the South and the
100s for the Southwest.
   Tonight, the thermometer could dip into the 30s in the Midwest,
Northeast and the central Appalachians.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 107 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

   A plane arrived with 160 Westerners and
other foreigners aboard who had been trapped in Kuwait by the Iraqi
invasion, and some described deteriorating conditions in the
annexed country.
   ``I feel very happy. I'm glad I came to this country,'' said an
Indian pediatrician who arrived Sunday on the plane with his wife
and six children.
   The man, who declined to be identified because of fear he would
endanger people left behind in Kuwait, said he heard reports of
atrocities, but had not witnessed any.
   The charter flight brought a group of 54 Americans and 106
non-U.S. citizens. Sixty-six were children or infants, 50 were
women and 44 were men, said Helen Szablya, a spokeswoman with the
state Department of Human Resources.
   It was the third charter to fly evacuees from Kuwait to
Baltimore via Bagdad and London. A flight carrying 285 people
arrived Saturday.
   An American evacuee said military action should be taken to oust
Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   ``The Kuwaiti people want military action, we can't wait for the
sanctions to work,'' said the woman.
   She described random killings, deserted streets and nights
punctuated by gunfire.
   Many of the evacuees left behind husbands and fathers who have
been barred from leaving after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used some Western men as a
human shield at key installations to deter possible military force.

   Stock prices dropped today in Tokyo as the dollar
rose against the Japanese yen.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 177.62 points on Friday, fell another 531.865
points, or 2.13 percent, closing at 24,365.60.
   Dealers said falling Japanese government bond prices and rising
interest rates led to the third consecutive decline in the
exchange's most widely followed barometer.
   The yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds rose to
8.565 percent, up from Friday's 8.460 percent close. Their price
fell to 81.19 points from 81.62.
   ``The market expects that earnings of many companies for the
current fiscal year will be considerably lower because of high bond
prices and depressed stock prices,'' said a dealer with a major
brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It makes it hard
for both institutional and private investors to find shares which
appear worth buying.''
   The dealers said announcements today of price hikes by major oil
wholesalers also discouraged investors from buying.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 300 million shares.
   In currency trading, the dollar closed at 137.00 yen, up 0.45
yen from last Friday's close. After opening lower at 136.45 yen,
the currency ranged between 136.43 yen and 137.10 yen. Spot volume
was estimated at about $6 billion.
   The yen fell against the U.S. and European currencies as
investors sold the Japanese currency in an attempt to correct
overbought yen positions, said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with
New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Institutional investors had bought the yen and sold
substantial amounts of European and U.S. currencies before settling
their accounts for the first half of fiscal 1990,'' he said. The
middle of the standard Japanese fiscal year comes at the end of
September.
   Today, such investors bought the dollar at about 136.40-136.50
yen to make up their short, or oversold, positions, Kanai said.
   ``Weakness in the bond and the stock market also contributed to
the yen's weakness,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa, who a decade ago led Polish
workers in forming the East bloc's first free trade union,
announced today that he will run for president of Poland.
   ``Today I made up my mind. I am putting forward for society's
approval my readiness to be a candidate for the post of president
of the Polish Republic in popular elections,'' the Solidarity
chairman said in a statement from the union's headquarters in the
Baltic port of Gdansk.
   ``For me, it is a fulfillment of the pledge I made in August
1980,'' said Walesa. He was catapulted to fame that month by a
leading role in strikes that spurred the government to recognize
the Solidarity labor federation.
   Walesa, a skilled negotiatior, also played a key role in the
spring of 1989 in the talks that led Communist authorities to
eventually hand over power to pro-Solidarity forces.
   The 46-year-old electrician at the Gdansk shipyard where
Solidarity was born is at odds with his former allies now running
Poland's government. He has suggested for nearly a year that he
might run.
   Post-Communist Poland's first fully democratic presidential and
parliament elections are expected as early as this fall and no
later than spring.
   Supporters of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former
close adviser Walesa picked to be the East bloc's first
non-Communist government leader, want Mazowiecki to run for
president. Mazowiecki has not said whether he would run, and his
office said today there would be no immediate response to Walesa's
decision.
   The country's current president, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, is
Poland's former Communist leader and ordered a 1981 military
crackdown that attempted to crush Solidarity.
   Jaruzelski said through a spokesman today that Walesa's
presidential bid ``reflects the process of democratic changes in
Poland.''
   Jaruzelski was elected by parliament last year as part of the
political compromise that gave pro-Solidarity forces control of the
government.
   Walesa has charged that too many supporters of the old Communist
administration remain in key posts and that the government is
losing touch with the problems of Poland.
   Two camps - the beginning of a multiparty system after four
decades of Communist control - have emerged in the political feud.
   One, the Center Alliance, supports Walesa for president and is
identified with workers and the Solidarity union in Gdansk.
   The other, known by the acronym ROAD, backs Mazowiecki and is
associated with intellectuals and the government in Warsaw. ROAD
organizers have called on Mazowiecki to make his decision by the
end of September.
   Walesa predicted last week that he would win. He said that
Mazowiecki would receive 35 percent of the vote if he ran.
   ``I am not worried about victory, but about its scale,'' Walesa
said. ``The situation is hard, and if the president is elected with
only 50 percent of the vote, he will have to work 48 hours a day
... Thus he must win with 80 percent.''
   Jaruzelski has said he will resign early from his six-year term
as president. He was elected in July 1989 largely to smooth
relations with the Soviet Union after historic accords between
Solidarity and then-Communist authorities paved the way for the
democratic transformation of Poland and other Eastern European
states.
   Poland's powerful Roman Catholic primate. Cardinal Jozef Glemp,
has called together the leaders of the country's political factions
for a meeting Tuesday to discuss the next stage of the nation's
democratic development.
   Parliament is scheduled to begin debate Thursday on a schedule
for elections.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers today derided President Bush for
warning in a broadcast message to Iraqis that Saddam Hussein was
steering them toward war. One declared: ``Mr. Bush, we listened to
your message, but please shut up.''
   Bush's speech to the Iraqi people touched off street protests
Sunday in Baghdad, Iraq's capital. Thousands of Iraqis marched and
shouted, ``Death to Bush! Death to America!''
   In a move consolidating control of Kuwait, authorities announced
today that Iraq has ordered the dissolution of Kuwait Airways, that
country's flagship air carrier.
   Iraqi authorities allowed Bush's eight-minute speech to be
broadcast, apparently in its entirety, on Sunday evening. Iraq had
offered Bush television time after U.S. officials complained of the
air time given Saddam, the Iraqi leader, by Western media.
   In the message with an Arabic voice-over and subtitles from the
U.S. government, Bush warned that Iraq was internationally isolated
and ``on the brink of war.'' He said Saddam had miscalculated and
should withdraw from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
   ``Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle
between Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world,''
said Bush, standing in front of his White House desk with the
American flag behind him.
   In a 25-minute rebuttal Sunday after Bush's message, Iraqi
authorities responded with a statement on Iraqi TV saying his
speech was ``full of lies and contradictions.''
   ``Should war be imposed on us, the Iraqi people will not
hesitate in joining to teach the aggressor an important lesson,''
the announcer said.
   Today, the government-owned newspaper Al-Jumhuriya, or The
Republic, published a front-page commentary headlined, ``The
Illusions of Mr. Bush.''
   ``Once again the president of the United States fails to
understand the mentality and psychology of the Iraqi people,'' it
said. ``Instead of correcting his previous mistakes, Bush wants to
push the area to the abyss of untold catastrophes.''
   The Arab-language newspaper said Bush is the victim of his own
hatred for Iraq and its leaders. It defended Saddam, saying,``If
other people see the sun shining from the eastern horizon, Iraqis
see it shining in the face of Saddam Hussein.''
   Another commentary in Al-Jumhuriya headlined ``Shut up, Mr.
Bush'' said, ``America today is a bastion of oppression and we have
this to say: `Mr. Bush, we listened to your message, but please
shut up.'''
   The Iraqi army newspaper Al-Qadissiyah also taunted Bush, saying
his message was ``empty'' and avoided the issues.
   ``It is evident that Bush, who is the president of a state which
claims the leadership of the world, has failed in his first test
with the Iraqi people,'' Al-Qadissiyah said.
   It also questioned Bush's claim to represent world opinion.
   The paper declared that ``Bush wants to say that he has a
mandate to carry out his aggression against Iraq, but we know that
the decision to go to war with Iraq is purely American.''
   The semi-independent newspaper Iraq ran a page-one headline:
``Bush Tricks.'' It said Bush's message was evidence of how the
United States is moving toward confrontation with Iraq and the Arab
and Islamic nations.
   ``It reveals the arrogance of the United States, which wants to
impose itself as regent on the international community,'' the paper
said. ``President Bush's message was full of lies, forgery and
contradictions.''
   Sunday's demonstration began with a few hundred men who gathered
in the streets of Baghad. As they marched through residential
neighborhoods, thousands of others, including women and children,
joined them.
   In addition to denouncing Bush, they called Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia ``traitors of the Arab
world'' for backing the U.S.-led multinational troop buildup that
began in response to Iraq's seizure of oil-rich Kuwait.
   The dissolution of Kuwait Airlines was announced today in a
presidential decree published in Al-Qadissiyah. It said all assets
were transferred to the government-run Iraqi Airways.

<HEAD>IRA Says It Shot Police Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlawed Irish Republican
Army has claimed it executed a police officer who was seized
earlier by armed men.
   The IRA statement, relayed anonymously to the media Sunday
night, said the officer, 42-year-old Louis Robinson, had been shot
to death after questioning.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police force, said it was
investigating a report that a body had been found. Police normally
are cautious about approaching bodies for fear of booby traps.
   Robinson's wife, Ann, 39, had earlier made a television plea for
her husband to be released unharmed. He had been on sick leave for
three years and was being treated for depression.
   ``He is a human being, he is my husband and the fact that he is
not well makes it even more horrific. Please let him go. Let him go
home,'' she said.
   If Robinson is dead, he is the eighth police officer slain this
year and the 274th to be killed since the IRA launched its violent
campaign in 1969 to end British rule in the province.
   His death brings the total of civilians, police and soldiers
killed in the past 21 years to 2,813.
   A search for Robinson had gone on all through Saturday night and
Sunday on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic.
   Police said Robinson had been on a fishing trip to the republic
in Dingle, County Kerry, with five friends in the Northern Ireland
prison service. On the way home Saturday night, their van was
stopped by about a dozen armed men after crossing the border on the
Dublin-Belfast road in south Armagh.
   Police said Robinson and two of his friends were bundled into
the trunks of cars and driven off while the other three in the
party fled in the darkness into surrounding fields.
   Two of the men abducted were badly beaten but released later
near Belleek village, seven miles away. They were treated in a
hospital and one was detained with rib injuries.
   Police said the gunmen asked for Robinson by name when they
stopped the van.
   The south Armagh area is known as ``bandit country'' by the
British army because of the high level of support there for the IRA
and the large number of IRA attacks.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, assailed for
indecision on overhauling the economy, called today for a national
referendum on whether to end the collectivization of farmland and
return it to individuals.
   It apparently would be the first national referendum ever
conducted in the Soviet Union, and Gorbachev's proposal reflects
the deep split in opinion about how to rescue the economy.
   He spoke a day after 50,000 protesters marched to the Kremlin
and demanded the resignation of Gorbachev and his prime minister
over the state of the economy, which is plagued by
underproductivity and worsening consumer shortages that have
included bread lines in Moscow this month.
   The demonstrators carried banners reading ``The Economy is a
Disaster.''
   In a 30-minute address to the national parliament today,
Gorbachev said the fate of farmland ``is too big a decision,
comrades, to be made in offices, auditoriums or meeting halls -
even as important as the one in which we are working today.''
   The parliament, or Supreme Soviet, was opening debate on
competing economic reform plans.
   Last week, Gorbachev endorsed a plan that would move the Soviet
Union toward a market economy in 500 days. It would include
allowing farmers and other private citizens the right to own and
sell land and pass it to their heirs.
   So far, Soviet reforms have stopped short of full privatization
of land, in part because of staunch opposition from traditional
Communists. Land was collectivized in a bloody 1929-32 campaign
under Josef Stalin, leaving a legacy of fear and distrust among
farmers.
   Several competing reform plans have been proposed, including a
radical version backed by Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin
and approved by the republic's legislature. Russia is the largest
of the 15 Soviet republics with half the country's people and
three-fourths of its land mass.
   The national prime minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, last week
proposed a more moderate plan that would only partially dismantle
the state planning bureaucracy.
   In his address today, Gorbachev stopped short of advocating any
specific proposals. It was not immediately clear how strongly he
supports the proposal to decollectivize land.
   ``The question of whether there should be private ownership of
land or not is the sovereign right of the people to decide, and it
can be decided only by a referendum - that's my point of view,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev called privatization of land ``the most difficult
issue'' in devising plans for reform. He also emphasized the need
for political stability, a tack he has taken in the past to counter
calls for the resignation of Ryzhkov and other national leaders.
   Reshuffling ``the top echelons of power ... would draw us into
grim political battles, (and) would heighten confrontation in
society at a time when we most badly need consolidation to carry
out the market economy program and to draft a new federal treaty,''
Gorbachev said.
   His remarks appeared designed in part to calm fears among
Communist Party members and other elements of Soviet society
opposed to moving to a market economy.
   He said that no matter which proposal is adopted, the government
should protect the population from the negative aspects of a market
economy, such as inflation, unemployment and possible sharp rises
in the costs of basics like health services and housing.
   ``We need to guarantee Soviet citizens a basic wage, pensions,
housing and free medical care,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov, in a television interview Saturday, said he feared that
a 500-day transition to a market economy would cause widespread
suffering. His more conservative reform program would keep central
planning through 1991.
   After Gorbachev addressed parliament, economist Stanislav
Shatalin told lawmakers he opposed the proposed referendum, saying
it would take at least six months and delay the reforms.
   ``If all our lives we make the heavy decisions by referendum ...
then we're not truly taking responsibility. It's not the way
politicians should talk,'' he said. Shatalin helped draft the
economic plan backed by Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev interrupted Shatalin's remarks to stress that he was
not in favor of referenda on a wide range of subjects, but ``only
on the matter of land, the land on which we live.''
   The situation was clouded further when Deputy Prime Minister
Leonid Abalkin told lawmakers that the 542-member Supreme Soviet
lacked the legal authority to schedule a referendum on
decollectivization, as implied by Gorbachev.
   Abalkin said the only body with the constitutional power to
order a referendum was the Congress of People's Deputies, the
2,250-member body that elects the legislature and the president.
Gorbachev sat expressionless during Abalkin's remarks.

<HEAD>Army Won't Automatically Retaliate For Iraqi Attack on Jordan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army chief of staff says Israel will not
automatically respond in kind to an Iraqi invasion of Jordan,
signaling an easing of Israel's stand on the gulf crisis.
   The comment by Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, reported today by Israeli
newspapers, followed suggestions that an Iraqi invasion of Jordan
could be aimed at drawing Israel into the gulf conflict as a way of
uniting Arab nations behind Iraq.
   Shomron's statements appeared to back away from Defense Minister
Moshe Arens' warnings that Israel would act immediately if Iraq
invaded Jordan. Arens has made the statement repeatedly since
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Shomron said that by placing such a ``red line,'' Israel did not
mean ``that it's an automatic system, that if an Iraqi soldier
steps on it an electric circuit will close and an entire military
system will be put into action,'' newspapers said.
   Shomron was quoted as saying that if Iraqi troops entered
Jordan, Israel would first examine which troops went in and would
study the possible impact of any Israeli response.
   However, Shomron also said Israel's air force, military
intelligence and civil defense units were on heightened alert,
because of Jordan's closeness to Iraq and to radical Palestinian
guerrilla groups that support Sadam Hussein.
   The Haaretz daily said Shomron also disclosed, in a briefing
with Israeli military reporters, that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
has secretly agreed to increase the defense budget to confront the
new Middle East buildup.
   An unidentified military source was quoted as estimating the
increase as an additional $205 million. The present budget allots
about $5 billion to defense.
   Reports on Shomron's briefing said the chief of staff was
concerned by the protracted U.S. standoff with Iraq and repeated
warnings by Iraqi leaders that Israel could come under attack if
war breaks out.
   Israel is also worried by Jordan King Hussein's fence-mending
last weekend with radical Palestinian guerrilla leaders George
Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, Shomron reportedly said.
   The two leaders are visiting Jordan's capital, Amman, ending a
20-year rupture in ties with Jordan's King Hussein. According to
the Post, the army feared Hussein could become incapable of
preventing the guerrillas from launching cross-border raids from
Jordan into Israel.
   In a related development, the Haaretz military correspondent
quoted American army experts as saying Iraq has recently developed
new nerve gas warheads for ground-to-ground missiles.
   The same experts reportedly questioned the potential accuracy of
such missiles. They also noted Iraq has developed this capability
as part of a new technological push since its invasion of Kuwait,
Haaretz said.
   Israel is particularly nervous about Iraq's chemical arms
capability since Saddam has threatened to use such weapons against
the Jewish state if his country is attacked.

   Mayor Xavier Suarez pulled a gun and scared off two
men who robbed his wife at their home, police said. Both suspects
remained at large early today.
   Rita Suarez had just escorted relatives to their car outside the
Suarezes' private residence just south of Miami's downtown Sunday
evening when the robbers ordered her inside, said police spokesman
Robert Navarro.
   ``One puts a gun to her head and demands her money and
jewelry,'' Navarro said. ``She yells and the mayor hears it
upstairs.'' The mayor armed himself and yelled out the window,
``Let her go!'' and the robbers fled, Navarro said.
   No shots were fired and nobody was injured in the incident, but
the thieves did make off with some of Mrs. Suarez's possessions, he
said. He wouldn't specify what was stolen or say what type of guns
were involved.
   While Suarez was loading his weapon, he ordered his 12-year-old
son, Francis, to call for help on a direct line to the police
department, Navarro said.
   Officers arrived in minutes and surrounded the two-story pink
stucco home on Miami Avenue, but the robbers had fled.
   It's not the first time crime has hit the home where the
Suarezes and their four children have lived since 1985. Last year,
the house was robbed while the family was away on a summer
vacation, and in 1987, a car was stolen from the driveway, said
Odalys Mon, the mayor's chief of staff.
   The mayor has police protection only occasionally, Mon said, and
police were not at the Suarez residence when the robbers appeared.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq have halted a monthlong
prisoner of war exchange during which some 75,000 POWs were
repatriated, but both sides still hold many prisoners, a Red Cross
official said today.
   There was no explanation from either side. The prisoners had
been seized during the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war and their release
had been a sign of the warming relations between the two nations.
   An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
in a telephone interview from Geneva that it was not immediately
known how many prisoners had yet to be repatriated.
   But the Red Cross, which is coordinating the exchange, has
estimated that some 100,000 prisoners were held by both sides
before the exchange began.
   The move came as an Iranian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mottaki met in Baghdad with an Iraqi team led
by foreign undersecretary Wisam Al-Zahawi to discuss normalization
of ties between the former gulf war foes.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported Sunday that
repatriation of the prisoners, which began Aug. 17 after Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein gave in to Iranian territorial demands
over their shared border, was abruptly halted Sunday without any
explanation from Baghdad.
   Reports from Iraq confirmed that no Iraqi prisoners had been
repatriated since Sunday, either.
   The prisoners who still have to be exchanged are those whom the
Red Cross had been unable to register.
   Internationally isolated after his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam last month made peace with Iran.
   He initiated the prisoner exchange, agreed to shared sovereignty
over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border
between the two countries, and removed troops from Iranian
territory captured during the war.

<HEAD>Saudi, Soviet Reach Tentative Agreement on Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union reached a
preliminary agreement today to restore diplomatic relations after a
break of more than 50 years, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Saudi
counterpart, Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al Saud, also called for the
immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, Tass said.
   Shevardnadze said the two nations reached a preliminary
agreement to restore diplomatic relations, and he hoped the
question would be settled fully after the Saudi minister met with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Tass said.
   ``The issue of establishing official contacts between the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics and Saudi Arabia has long been
ripe,'' a Foreign Ministry official, Sergei Kirpichenko, was quoted
by Tass as saying.
   Saudi Arabia's new rapport with Moscow comes after the Soviet
Union -despite its long alliance with Iraq - broke with Baghdad and
condemned the invasion of Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia and Moscow had full diplomatic relations until
1938, when dictator Josef Stalin closed his embassy in Jiddah in a
cost-cutting move.
   Several attempts to re-establish ties during the 1980s faltered
over what Saudi Arabia called the Soviet Union's ``belligerent
attitude'' toward its 50 million Moslems.
   In their discussions of the Persian Gulf crisis, the Saudi and
Soviet foreign ministers were quoted as saying both wanted a
peaceful settlement.
   ``We hope that faced with the world community's unanimity, Iraq
will agree to the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its
troops from Kuwait and will restore legality,'' Tass quoted the
Saudi official as saying.
   On Sunday, the Saudi Arabian minister of pilgrimage and
endowments arrived in Moscow to attend a three-day Islamic
conference and meet with Soviet Moslems, Tass said.
   The visit is the first ever to be made by a religious affairs
minister to the Soviet Union.
   As part of the improving atmosphere between the two countries,
King Fahd, the Saudi monarch, recently donated about 1.6 million
copies of the Moslem holy book, the Koran, to Soviet Moslems. The
Soviet Union allowed more than 1,000 Soviet Moslems to make the
annual pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca this summer.

<HEAD>First Cambodian Council Session Ends Without Progress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with fight over Sihanouk's role,

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's warring factions today held
the first session of a council formed to try to end 11 years of
civil war and argued over the future role of guerrilla leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The Supreme National Council, created last week during talks in
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, met for three hours at the Cambodian
Embassy. The embassy had been abandoned since 1975, but 100 Thai
workers cleared it of overgrown foliage and repainted it over the
weekend.
   ``There were some problems, and we will have to resume
discussions tomorrow,'' said Premier Hun Sen of the
Vietnamese-installed government. He would not elaborate.
   The council has six seats for the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh
government and two spots for each of the rebel factions. The plan
also allows for a 13th seat for a chairman, but the post remains in
dispute.
   The guerrillas want Sihanouk to hold the chairman seat. A Thai
Foreign Ministry official said Hun Sen replied that Sihanouk could
only be chairman if he also takes the spot of one of the dozen
regular members.
   Sihanouk officials accused Hun Sen of ``intransigence.''
   The council now includes six representatives of Hun Sen's
government and two representatives from each of the three allied
guerrilla groups.
   Not discussed were other items Hun Sen placed on the agenda:
choosing a delegation to this week's U.N. General Assembly, and
arranging a ``voluntary cease-fire'' and an end to outside military
aid.
   The rebel coalition includes the non-Communist forces of
Sihanouk and former Cambodian premier Son Sann, who have been
backed by Washington, and the Chinese-backed Communist Khmer Rouge,
ousted by the Vietamese in 1978.
   During nearly four years in power, the Khmer Rouge tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, resulting in
the deaths of nearly 1 million people.
   The Supreme National Council would cede much of its authority to
the United Nations, which would administer the country until free
elections. U.N. officials have said up to 20,000 troops and
civilian personnel could be sent to Cambodia to oversee the plan.
   The U.N. plan, which also calls for disarming the four armies,
was adopted Aug. 28 by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France.
   Hun Sen met in the session with Khieu Samphan of the Khmer
Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who commands forces loyal to Sihanouk,
his father.
   The sparsely furnished meeting room was decorated with fresh
flowers and photographs of Cambodia, including one of Angkor Wat,
ancient capital of its greatest civilization.

   Rampaging inmates at the Federal Deportation
Center set fire to a housing wing, but authorities brought the
situation under control after about two hours, authorities said.
   ``All the inmates are accounted for,'' Oakdale Mayor George
Mowad said Sunday night.
   No one was seriously injured and no hostages were taken, Mowad
said. One Bureau of Prisons employee was treated for smoke
inhalation.
   The Deportation Center holds aliens awaiting deportation after
serving time for crimes committed in the United States. It is near
the Federal Detention Center, which was rebuilt after it was
destroyed by fire during an eight-day siege by Cuban detainees in
November 1987.
   Inmates at the deportation center, which holds about 300 people,
set fire to one wing of one dormitory during a disturbance at about
9 p.m. Sunday, Mowad said. The fire was extinguished about 11 p.m.
   At least five state police patrol cars were dispatched to the
prison, and the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office also sent about
10 deputies to the prison. A roadblock was set up about a half mile
from the center to keep people away.
   Edwin Strother, who lives near the federal complex, said
Sunday's incident didn't compare with the November 1987 riot at the
Detention Center.
   ``The other time it worried me. This time it didn't,'' Strother
said. ``The last time they burned that thing plumb to the ground.''
   The Deportation Center, which opened in April, was built by the
Bureau of Prisons and is operated in conjunction with the INS and
the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Hearings are held at
the center to determine whether aliens are to be deported.

<HEAD>Soviet-US Mistrust Given Way To Cautious Friendship, Reagan Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto MOSB3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mistrust between the Soviet Union and the United
States has given way to ``cautious friendship,'' former President
Ronald Reagan told a Soviet parliamentary committee today.
   He later met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan, addressing the international committee of the Supreme
Soviet legislature, predicted gradual arms reductions by both
superpowers in the next five years ``as we find new ways to work
together on matters where our goals are similar.''
   ``We both have powerful tools of war,'' he said. ``Neither of us
wants to use them. However, we can use the knowledge about hem to
help blunt or head off regional conflicts or reckless acts of
renegades.''
   ``Together, our great size can be used in the service of all
humankind to persuade those whose passions have reached the danger
point to cool down again,'' he said, speaking from a podium beneath
a portrait of Karl Marx.
   Reagan singled out Soviet cooperation in countering Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait as an example of ``our mutual understanding for
the need to prevent the spread of conflict in a volatile region of
the world.''
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived in Moscow on Sunday, the
second day of a five-day visit.
   Reagan's talks with Gorbachev today were closed to the media.
Reagan is scheduled to meet Tuesday with students at Moscow State
University.
   Referring to efforts by the Soviet government to hammer out a
new federal structure with its 15 ethnically diverse republics,
Reagan appealed for reason to prevail over passion.
   ``As you find a reformulation of the relationships in your
union, you will find there is a period of uncertainty and
tension,'' he said. ``Differences can be resolved in ways that are
fair to all, but reason must prevail over passion if there is to be
a climate conducive to the settlement of disagreements.
   Thirteen republics have declared independence or sovereignty,
defined as republican laws having precedence over national laws.
   ``When men and women are free to express themselves, and do so
in large numbers, as is happening in your land today, a consensus
will emerge over time on major issues,'' Reagan told about 50
lawmakers gathered around a long conference table.
   The Reagans, on a 10-day European tour, spent Sunday in
Leningrad touring the city's cathedrals and the Hermitage Museum.

<TEXT>
   Ghanaian warplanes bombed rebels in
the Liberian capital of Monrovia in retaliation for a mortar attack
that killed five members of a West African peacekeeping force,
reports from the city said.
   Liberian rebels under Charles Taylor shelled the headquarters of
the 3,000-member task force Saturday, killing three Nigerian
medical workers. Another shell hit a Ghanaian warship docked in the
port, killing two sailors.
   In response, two Ghanaian fighter bombers went into action
Sunday ``looking for and neutralizing artillery emplacements,'' the
British Broadcasting Corp. quoted a West African task force
spokesman as saying.
   Nigeria, meanwhile, sent 650 more soldiers to join its
1,000-member contingent in the force. The soldiers were flown
Sunday from Lagos to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where they were to
board ships for Monrovia, a Nigerian government statement said.
   A rebel radio broadcast said three aircraft bombed Robertsfield
International Airport, and charged that the United States was
involved. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia denied any
American planes took part in the alleged raid.
   The airport, 30 miles east of Monrovia, has not been used by
international airlines since it fell behind Taylor's lines in May.
   Monrovia has been cut off from the outside world since June,
without running water, electricity or telephone communications.
Little food has gotten through, and many people are dying of
starvation.
   The war began when Taylor invaded from Ivory Coast in last
December. President Samuel Doe was slain Sept. 10 by a breakaway
rebel group led by Prince Johnson.
   Now the rebel factions headed by Johnson and Taylor are fighting
for control. Rebels from both groups also have been hunting down
members of Doe's Krahn tribe and remnants of his army.
   The West African task force has been criticized as ineffectual
in halting the fighting, which has killed more than 5,000 civilians
this year. The 3,000 troops from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra
Leone and Gambia arrived in Monrovia early in August.
   Taylor has accused the West African force of wanting to impose a
puppet government. He is holding more than 2,000 West African
civilians hostage.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 5,000 public school teachers went on
strike today over $400,000 worth of health benefits - the first
walkout in New Orleans schools since 1978.
   Union president Nat Lacour said the Orleans Parish School
Board's refusal to bend on health benefits that demand triggered
the strike. He reinstated earlier demands that had been dropped
during bargaining, for a $45 million package that includes pay
raises for the system's teachers plus 1,100 teachers' aides and
school secretaries.
   The school board insisted that classes would continue almost as
usual for more than 84,000 pupils, with substitute teachers and
administrators replacing teachers who refused to cross picket
lines.
   Parents of some emotionally disturbed or educationally
handicapped children were told that classes for their children
would be canceled.
   Pickets were out before dawn, their signs bearing messages such
as: ``No raise, No work.'' School buses rolled past the chanting
pickets half empty. Parents walked with their children to the
schools, then stood about in small knots, talking quietly.
   ``We're not striking just for money. ... We're looking for
professional respect,'' said Katy Hall, a sixth-grade teacher at
Lafayette Elementary School, where the picket line went up more
than two hours before classes were to open.
   Lacour, president of the United Teachers of New Orleans, gave
strike orders Sunday in a blistering speech that laid the blame on
what he called the school board's poor spending habits and
inflexibility.
   ``It's a strike over economic justice,'' Lacour said.
   The teachers scaled back over the weekend to demanding $1
million in additional health benefits. The school board turned them
down and stuck to the $600,000 it had on the table.
   ``We cannot give what we do not have,'' said Frank Fudesco, the
board's chief negotiator. He appealed to teachers ``to weigh
loyalty to union against loyalty to students.''
   The teachers, who receive pay from both the school system and
the state, have already received a 7 percent wage increase from the
state this year. Salaries range from $19,455 for a starting teacher
to $35,111 for someone with a doctorate and 25 years of experience.
   About 650 teachers' aides, who make about $10,000 a year, would
get raises of 4 percent to 5 percent under union demands, as would
450 clerical workers, who make about $17,000.
   In his speech, Lacour complained that school administrators
drive new cars while schools go without soap and toilet paper. He
also criticized Superintendent Everett Williams' $102,700 a year
salary, which Lacour said is comparable to the pay in larger
cities.
   Administrators have dismissed the union's complaints and say
their spending has been appropriate.
   With the board's refusal to agree to the union demands, teachers
said they will circulate recall petitions against all school board
members. In addition, after the strike broke out, the union
reverted to its original demands for 10 percent raises each year of
a three-year contract.
   The board has raised teachers' salaries twice since 1983, but
Lacour said the increases have been eroded by rising health
insurance and retirement costs.
   The union also is seeking collective bargaining rights for about
100 psychologists and other employees who evaluate students for
special education services.

   The army today evacuated nearly 200
policemen and soldiers who defended the Jaffna Fort during a
three-month siege by Tamil rebels, military officials said.
   The rescued security men were airlifted by helicopter from the
fort to an airstrip at Palali, also in Jaffna peninsula, officials
said.
   ``Some of them could hardly walk and had to be carried,'' said
one official who cannot be identified under briefing rules. ``They
will receive initial medical treatment and then be sent to Colombo
to their familes for a rest.''
   Troops broke through the siege last week to reach the fort at
the edge of Jaffna city, a predominately Tamil city 187 miles north
of Colombo.
   Jaffna is the stronghold of the Liberation Tigers for Tamil
Eelam, which has been fighting for an independent homeland for
Tamils in the Sinhalese-dominated country.
   The officials said the army has consolidated positions around
the fort and was slowly expanding its perimeters to reach the
closed government hospital in Jaffna.
   Twelve policemen and soldiers were killed during the siege and
were buried inside the fort, built by Dutch colonialists in the
17th century.
   The star-shaped fortress was cut off since Tamil rebels broke a
13-month cease-fire in June.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, while
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the populations.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since the ethnic war
erupted in 1983.

   ``L.A. Law'' won the Emmy for best drama
series for the third time in four years, ``Murphy Brown'' was named
best comedy and the acclaimed ``Twin Peaks,'' nominated 14 times,
managed only two technical trophies.
   Ted Danson, the skirt-chasing bartender Sam Malone on
``Cheers,'' finally won as best comedy series actor Sunday night
after being nominated eight times - every year the NBC show has
been on the air. And Candice Bergen of CBS' ``Murpy Brown'' won
best actress as the acid-tongued newswoman for a second consecutive
year.
   In a big signoff for ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' the British
comedian's program grabbed the most awards at the 42nd annual Emmys
with six. Ullman, who pulled the plug on the little-watched show
last spring, won Fox Broadcasting Co. its first Emmys last year.
   ``Oh, blimey, this brings it all full circle,'' said Miss
Ullman, honored with a pair of Emmys in the music-variety category
for her work as star and a writer. ``I miss the show a whole lot.''
   Peter Falk's rumpled but brilliant ``Columbo'' earned him the
dramatic actor award - his fourth Emmy for the role of the
trenchcoat-wearing detective he created during the '70s. Patricia
Wettig, who plays a cancer-stricken young mother on ABC's
``thirtysomething,'' won the best dramatic actress trophy.
   ``I would really like to thank all the women with cancer who
have shared their stories with me so wholeheartedly,'' a teary Miss
Wettig said. ``I shared their insights and their fears. I truly
salute their courage.''
   Despite 14 nominations, ABC's ``Twin Peaks,'' the strange new
series about murder in a Northwest logging town, captured only two
technical trophies - for editing and costuming. Both were given in
a non-televised ceremony Saturday.
   Instead, NBC's ``L.A. Law'' went home with the best drama Emmy -
an honor it also received in 1987 and 1989 - and won a writing
award plus a best supporting actor Emmy for Jimmy Smits, who plays
lawyer Victor Sifuentes.
   In a reversal of the order last year, ABC finished first with 22
awards, NBC won 18 and CBS, which topped the Big Three networks
with 27 Emmys in 1989, managed only 14 this year. Fox won nine
Emmys, the most in its four-year history. Cable's Home Box Office
collected eight.
   Best miniseries went to NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,''
an account of the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena. ``This is a victory for him, too,'' said executive
producer Michael Mann.
   Keenen Ivory Wayans, whose irreverent Fox comedy sketch series
``In Living Color'' won the variety, music or comedy category,
welled up. ``Oh, forget it,'' said the show's executive producer
and host. ``This is for you, Mom.''
   Scott Winant of ``thirtysomething,'' who tied with Thomas Carter
of ``Equal Justice'' for best drama series director, got choked up,
too. ``I'm afraid I'm not really going to be able to express
myself,'' he said.
   Danson's award was presented by the animated family from Fox's
``The Simpsons.'' Obnoxious 10-year-old son Bart Simpson shredded
the envelope containing Danson's name and pronounced himself the
winner.
   Asked how it felt to receive his trophy from cartoon characters,
Danson replied, ``I think it is appropriate after nine years. I
feel a little weird. I felt like if it didn't happen this year it
would be more embarrassing than ever before.''
   Joseph Sargent was named best director in a miniseries or
special for his work on CBS' ``Caroline?'' Vincent Gardenia won for
supporting actor in a miniseries or special, given for HBO's
``Age-Old Friends.''
   Eva Marie Saint took the trophy for supporting actress in a
miniseries or special, co-starring in NBC's ``People Like Us.''
   A special recognition was given to puppeteer Jim Henson, who
died earlier this year. To the strains of Kermit the Frog's song
``The Rainbow Connection,'' Miss Bergen, daughter of puppeteer
Edgar Bergen, movingly recounted Henson's career.
   Alex Rocco won outstanding supporting actor in a comedy for his
portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in ``The Famous Teddy
Z,'' which was canceled this year. The supporting actress award
went to Bebe Neuwirth, the cold-as-ice psychoanalyst on ``Cheers.''
   ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' collected trophies for best directing
(Michael Dinner) and writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series.
   Miss Bergen, Jay Leno and Jane Pauley were the program's hosts.
   During Saturday's technical awards, Fox's ``The Simpsons'' was
selected top animated program.
   Hume Cronyn, who starred in HBO's ``Age Old Friends,'' took the
prize for best actor in a miniseries or special.
   Barbara Hershey, who played the lead in CBS' ``A Killing in A
Small Town,'' won for best actress in a miniseries or special.

   About 200 Northwest loggers and community
leaders rallied on Capitol Hill today, asking for compassion for
mill workers and families who may be hurt by
environmentalist-backed plans to slow timber harvests.
   ``The social havoc and human suffering being caused in the
Northwest is a concern for everyone,'' said Valerie Johnson, leader
of the Oregon Lands Coalition.
   The push for protection of the region's old-growth forests has
intensified since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared in
June that one of its inhabitants, the northern spotted owl, is a
threatened species.
   ``The preservationist agenda has become more clear to us as we
learn what is happening in other parts of the nation. Farmers,
fishermen, miners - we are all being told that Americans don't need
us any more,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   The coalition is one of the groups making up the Northwest
Citizen's Lobby, which plans to lobby each member of Congress this
week in an effort to stir up opposition to proposals that would ban
logging across millions of acres of Northwest forests.
   Environmentalists planned their own lobbying blitz this week
after about 500 demonstrators rallied at the Capitol on Sunday to
protest a series of bills they say would further reduce the
shrinking supply of the nation's old-growth forests.
   ``The timber industry lobby has a national agenda as they grab
the wealth of public lands, operating from a national power base in
Congress,'' said Mark Winstein of Save America's Forests, an
organization that sponsored the demonstration.
   ``We didn't come to Washington to ask Congress for a handout. We
came to ask for the opportunity to continue working,'' said Doug
Robertson, a county commissioner from Roseburg, Ore., participating
in the Oregon Lands Coalition rally.
   ``All patriotic Americans must join forces to create a new power
base that will represent our desire for a healthy environment,''
said Winstein, whose coalition speaks for more than 30
organizations representing nearly 150,000 members in 18 states.
   At today's rally, Evelyn Badger presented Rep. Denny Smith,
R-Ore., with 40,000 petition signatures from Northwest families.
The petition asks Congress to consider the social and economic
impacts on families and communities as it weighs scientific
evidence concerning preservation plans for the Northwest's forests.
   ``There's a war waging across this nation and resource-dependent
people are losing,'' Ms. Badger said. ``The challenge now is to
convince federal lawmakers to weigh both the scientific evidence
and the social price tag.''
   Smith, who is seeking re-election and has been targeted by
environmentalists as an enemy, said the Northwest residents face an
uphill battle.

   The Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Mike Dugan,
was relieved of his duties today, the Pentagon said.
   The action came one day after Dugan was quoted in published
reports as saying U.S. military authorities had concluded that
massive air strikes are the only effective way of forcing Iraq out
of Kuwait if war erupted. Dugan was on a tour of U.S. military
instillations in Saudi Arabia when he made his comments.
   Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman, said he could not
immediately comment on the reason for Dugan's dismissal. He said a
formal announcement was being prepared.
   Dugan commanded the U.S. Air Force in Europe before his
appointment as chief of staff three months ago.
   On Sunday, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft distanced
the adminstration from Dugan's comments, which appeared in the Los
Angeles Times and The Washington Post.
   ``I would just point out that Gen. Dugan is not in the chain of
command, and he does not speak for the administration,'' Scowcroft
said.

   The sixth and final fuel compartment on a
burning gasoline tanker exploded this morning, the day after the
first in a series of blasts and fire injured 17 crew members,
authorities said.
   One crewman who apparently tried to swim for shore was missing.
   The blazing, 392-foot hulk burned through the night, casting an
orange glow across the Saginaw River.
   None of the cargo of 1 million gallons of gasoline had spilled
into the river from the double-hulled tanker, but Coast Guard
officials feared the hull might melt or break because of the
intense heat, spreading flaming fuel into the water.
   Officials decided this morning to use a Coast Guard cutter,
along with oil rig fire specialists from Texas, to spray the tanker
from bow to stern with fire-retarding foam. Then they would wait 24
hours before trying to move the ship.
   The M.V. Jupiter, a tanker owned by Cleveland Tankers Inc.,
erupted in flames Sunday morning while moored at a pier.
   It had pumped about 30,000 barrels of its 54,000-barrel cargo
into a pipeline leading to storage tanks ashore, said Dan Lacey,
spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc., parent company of Cleveland
Tankers.
   Ronald Stopyak, who had returned home 15 minutes before the
blast from working at a chemical plant across the river from the
tanker, said he raced back to work after hearing the explosion.
   ``I thought the plant exploded and when I got out there I saw
black smoke everywhere,'' he said. ``I saw the employees on the
ship go overboard. It was really hot. I could feel the heat from
across the river.''
   State environmental officials undertook water and air pollution
tests, said spokeswoman Susan Henry. A gasoline spill is less
damaging than an oil spill because gasoline evaporates easily.
   Gov. James Blanchard visited the site and declared an emergency
to free up state aid and assistance.
   Henry said Ashland had set up booms to contain any spill. Coast
Guard crews secured the tanker with cables to prevent it from
drifting into a bridge.
   The missing crewman was identified as Tom Sexton, 46, of Cedar
Falls, Iowa. Other crewmen said Sexton tried to swim for shore
after the explosion but apparently didn't make it.
   Bay Medical Center spokesman Curt Miller said 17 crew members
were treated there and three were admitted. Two had head injuries,
and a third suffered chest pains, he said.
   Bay City is a town of 40,000 on Lake Huron's Saginaw Bay, about
100 miles northwest of Detroit.

   Federal prosecutors said today they will not
retry Mayor Marion Barry on a dozen drug and perjury charges a jury
could not resolve. ``I'm obviously relieved,'' the mayor said.
   The government's decision came five weeks after Barry was
convicted of one misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and
acquitted on another. Jurors deadlocked on the 12 remaining perjury
and drug charges, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
declared a mistrial on those counts.
   Jackson set Oct. 26 as the sentencing date for the possession
charge. The mayor faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and
a $100,000 fine.
   At the sentencing hearing, prosecutors will make a formal motion
for dismissal of the unsettled charges. Jackson is expected to
grant the request.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin told the judge today,
``The government has made a determination not to seek retrial on
the pending counts.''
   Barry smiled broadly when Retchin announced the government's
decision.
   ``I'm obviously relieved at this phase of the legal
proceedings,'' Barry said afterward. He declined further comment.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens told reporters that even if Barry
were convicted on some of the remaining charges, the potential
sentence would not be significantly longer than what he already
faces.
   ``A retrial would achieve little more than what has already been
accomplished,'' Stephens said.
   ``When all the dust has settled, in the final analysis, the
ultimate truth remains: that the chief executive of this city
charged with leading the fight against illegal drugs and violence
has himself been convicted of contributing to that human
devastation,'' Stephens said.
   ``What has been achieved here really is substantial, and a
retrial would not contribute substantially more to that result, in
terms of the public record of the evidence,'' Stephens said.
   The prosecutor denied that political considerations, including
Barry's pre-trial decision not to run for re-election, entered into
his choice.
   ``Mr. Barry's political status and political future are not
factors we considered when making decisions about this
prosecution,'' Stephens said.
   A week after the jury's Aug. 10 verdict, Barry announced he
would run as an independent for a seat on the city council. He had
ruled out seeking a fourth four-year term as mayor before his trial
began.
   After the jury's verdict, Barry urged federal prosecutors to
abandon any thought of retrying him, saying: ``Now is the time for
healing. Let their judgment be our last judgment.''
   The jury's decision followed a dramatic eight-week trial in
which the jurors - and the world - watched videotape of Barry
smoking crack cocaine the night he was arrested in an FBI sting
operation at a downtown hotel room.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney for the Virgin Islands,
Terry Halperin, announced that she would not bring charges against
the mayor there.
   One of the felony perjury charges and the conspiracy charge
Barry faced involved alleged drug activity in the Virgin Islands
during 1986 and 1988.

   The Israeli government decided today not to seek
an extension of a court injunction that banned publication of a
book by a former intelligence agent.
   The decision means the book, ``By Way of Deception'' by Victor
Ostrovsky, could be on Canadian bookstore shelves by the end of the
month, a spokesman for Stoddart Publishing of Toronto said.
   The Israeli government won the 10-day injunction Sept. 7. It
argued that release of the book would endanger the lives of its
agents.
   ``The harm we were seeking to prevent has already occurred,''
Joel Goldenberg, a lawyer for the Israeli government, told the
general division of Ontario Court.
   He was referring to a New York appellate court decision Thursday
allowing the book - by Ostrovsky, a former Mossad agent, and
Canadian journalist Claire Hoy - to be published by St. Martin's
Press.
   ``Without the American decision, it would have been a tough
battle, but I think it's one we would have won,'' said Gordon Wood,
lawyer for Stoddart, Ostrovsky and Hoy.
   A day after the New York decision, bookstores were swamped with
requests for the book. Those that had copies sold out almost
immediately.
   St. Martin's had already shipped 17,000 copies of the book to
1,500 stores and reviewers before Israel obtained a temporary order
from a state Supreme Court justice barring sales.

   Forty-two Kuwaiti athletes accompanied by a
single coach arrived today from Saudi Arabia to take part in this
week's Asian Games, their entourage diminished by Iraq's invasion
of their homeland.
   Games officials did not say how large a delegation Kuwait
originally planned, but more coaches were to have come. Kuwait's
National Olympic Committee, now based in exile in Saudi Arabia,
said athletes who were out of the country during the Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion would come to the games.
   The chairman of Kuwait's National Olympic Committee, Sheikh
Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, was killed during the invasion. The sheik
also was president of the Olympic Council of Asia and was to have
presided over the Asian Games, which start Saturday.
   The Asian Games press center said 42 athletes arrived from Saudi
Arabia, including 23 soccer players, four swimmers, six table
tennis players, six track and field contestants and three judo
contenders. They were accompanied by a swimming coach.
   Kais Al-Yacoubi, a liaison officer for Iraq's National Olympic
Committee, said in Beijing last week that any Kuwait athletes
caught inside their country during the invasion would have to apply
to Iraqi authorities for exit permits to attend the games. He
refused to comment on the chances they would be allowed to leave.
   All 38 members of the Olympic Council of Asia are scheduled to
meet Thursday to decide whether Iraq should be banned from the
games. The council's 11-member executive bureau recommended a ban,
but the final decision will be made by a two-thirds majority of the
full council.
   China has said it welcomes participation by all council members
but also hopes all will comply with the council's decision. If Iraq
takes part, a boycott is feared by other Persian Gulf states.
   An Iraqi soccer team is in China for non-Asian Games competition
against Chinese teams, but Iraq's Asian Games team has yet to
arrive.

   Officials are investigating arson as
the cause of a fire that charred 2,500 acres in the Stanislaus
National Forest and forced 400 people to spend a night away from
their homes.
   ``It's definitely arson,'' U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Joan
Leidenthal said Sunday. Investigators had a few leads about a
possible culprit but were releasing no further information, she
said.
   The fire began Thursday in a campground on the north fork of the
Tuolumne River about 130 miles east of San Francisco.
   Aided by fairly cool temperatures in the low 80s, light wind
under 10 mph and normal humidity, about 2,700 firefighters
contained the blaze by 6 p.m. Sunday and expected to have it under
control later today.
   No buildings have been damaged, but the blaze forced the
evacuation of about 400 residents when flames came within a half
mile of their homes Friday.
   Residents were allowed to return to their homes on Saturday, and
the Forest Service said the threat to residents of the resort towns
of Mi-Wuk, Sierra Village and Sugarpine had passed.
   ``There was the potential to really burn a lot of structures,
but we protected quite a few. We just got lucky. The weather
cooperated,'' fire information officer Mike Brown said.
   Five firefighters were injured.
   The cost of fighting the fire climbed to $3.5 million.
   To the southeast, in fire-scarred Yosemite National Park, a
small fire charred about 120 acres near Mount Starr King, about 3
miles south of Half Dome. It was contained Sunday evening and full
control was expected later today, fire officials said.

<TEXT>
   A Libyan delegate at a conference of Arab
radicals called today for suicide attacks on U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia.
   Ibrahim Al-Kharraz, a member of the Libyan People's Congress,
said Arabs should follow the example of the suicide bombers who
blew up the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 Marines.
   ``We have the striking examples of heroes who turned their
bodies into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to
flee in darkness as happened to the American Marines in Beirut,''
said Al-Kharraz.
   The cheers and enthusiastic applause from delegates to the
conference of Arab leftists, Islamic party members and Palestinian
guerrilla factions underscored the depth of anti-American feeling
among Arab radicals.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has come out on the side
of Iraq during the crisis. But in Stockholm today, a senior PLO
official was quoted as saying Iraq must leave Kuwait and a solution
to the crisis should not be delayed by the Israeli-Palestinian
issue.
   The PLO has called for an international conference to settle the
gulf crisis and deal with Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   ``But the first step must be that Iraq leaves Kuwait. We do not
demand that the two issues be linked,'' Nabil Shaath, an aide to
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, was quoted as telling the Swedish national
news agency TT.
   ``We have been hurt by the saying that PLO is on the side of
Iraq. But this is not true. We demand that Iraq leave Kuwait,''
Shaath said.
   The delegates at the Jordan conference also cheered when Adnan
Saududdin, a member of the Jordanian Islamic Front and the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, called for an Islamic uprising
to topple Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Saududdin said Moslems should rise up against Mubarak and free
Egypt from ``the shackles of the treasonous CampDavid accords.''
   The three-day conference also got a lift when the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement that King
Hussein met today with its leader, Nayef Hawatmeh. There was no one
immediately available at the king's press office or the Information
Minstry to confirm the report.
   Hawatmeh had been banned from Jordan for 20 years after the
``Black September'' war in 1970 between Palestinian guerrillas and
the king's forces. However, Hawatmeh and George Habash, the leader
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who also was
banned for 20 years, returned to Jordan last week for the
conference.
   Hawatmeh's Palestinian guerrilla faction said that the king and
Hawatmeh talked at length about the gulf crisis and Middle East
problems.

   Mountaineering accidents killed
seven West Germans and three Swiss over the weekend in the Swiss
Alps, police said Monday.
   Six of the Germans, grouped in two rope parties, died when they
fell at a height of 13,200 feet on Mount Aletschorn, near Zermatt
in the southern canton of Valais.
   Police said the victims apparently slipped on ice. Icy
conditions were also responsible for the deaths of two Swiss
climbers in another part of Valais, police reported.
   It did not give details of the other accidents.

   American troops sweltering in Saudi
Arabia might be allowed to take their rest and recreation in
foreign cities, on private beaches or on cruise ships, U.S.
officials say.
   The need for some kind of holiday system has become apparent
with the realization that U.S. military forces are likely to be in
the desert at least until early 1991 and probably longer.
   At the same time, officials concede there are special problems
in finding ways to let American soldiers relax in Saudi Arabia, a
strictly conservative Moslem society where they cannot mix casually
with the local population or the opposite sex.
   Moreover, the sheer size of the American force - likely to reach
200,000-plus within a few weeks - could have a severe impact on
nearby smaller Persian Gulf states, such as Bahrain and Dubai,
where alcohol is available and the lifestyle is somewhat more
Westernized.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in
Operation Desert Shield, said in an interview that he envisioned an
R&amp;R system similar to that provided for American troops in Vietnam
two decades ago.
   Those soldiers were allowed one week's leave a year, with the
round-trip air fare paid to any one of several places, including
Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Bangkok and Hawaii.
   ``I'd hope we could have the same sort of platter of selection
available here,'' Schwarzkopf said.
   But, he added, ``we're still in the process of brainstorming
this whole routine. ... We're a long way from having any firm plan
for R&amp;R.''
   One obstacle is that Defense Department regulations permit
government-paid leaves only for soldiers in areas where there is
hostile fire, he said.
   ``I know they're looking at that and a lot of other things,'' he
said, noting that another Pentagon regulation already has been
changed to give Saudi Arabia-based troops free mail privileges,
usually permitted only in combat zones.
   A key concern in finding suitable recreation centers was the
threat of Iraqi-inspired terrorist attacks, Schwarzkopf said.
   ``I'm not going to set up another Beirut barracks to get blown
up,'' he said, referring to the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine
barracks in Beirut in which 241 servicemen were killed. ``We're
certainly factoring that into it.''
   If a Vietnam-style R&amp;R is approved, possible sites might include
Cairo and vacation spots in Europe, such as the U.S.-owned military
ski resort and recreation center in Garmisch, West Germany.
   Schwarzkopf said another proposal was for ``a couple of cruise
ships, where they can relax and dance and have music and air
conditioning and swimming pools, and just sort of live it up.''
   Schwarzkopf said, however, that this was ``an idea only,'' as
was another suggestion for a private beach somewhere that could
serve American troops without their numbers having too much impact
on the local population.
   The two most logical R&amp;R sites in the region are Bahrain, just
across a 12-mile causeway from Saudi Arabia, and Dubai, the major
port of the United Arab Emirates near the southeastern end of the
Persian Gulf.
   Both are accustomed to U.S. Navy personnel, in relatively small
numbers and civilian clothes. But they could have difficulty coping
with an influx of military people looking for fun.
   Schwarzkopf said there had been ``no agreements ... no formal
contacts'' with those countries. But he said he could imagine
``some entrepreneurial Bahrainis who wouldn't mind setting up a
hotel at some location that wouldn't interfere with Bahraini
life.''
   In addition to planning for out-of-country R&amp;R, officers are
setting up centers with air-conditioned tents, showers and
television, where troops can gain a few days' respite from the
desert.
   Schwarzkopf acknowledged that while the military faced a
``shortage of videotapes,'' it also had to deal with the Saudis'
ban on any sexually oriented materials.
   ``It's their law, just as we have customs regulations that don't
allow outsiders to bring certain things into the United States,''
he said,
   ``So if they deem it objectionable and confiscate it, that's OK.
I'm sure there are plenty of other videotapes out there that will
not be deemed objectionable.''

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia, NASA's oldest and most
delayed shuttle, has been grounded twice in four months by hydrogen
leaks and once by payload problems.
   Columbia set the record for the most launch delays in January
1986, when it was delayed seven times before a satellite delivery
mission.
   So far this year, only three shuttles have flown. NASA
originally planned nine missions for 1990, but now is hoping for
six.
   The following is a chronology of this year's shuttle flights and
Columbia's delays since May:
   Jan. 9 - Columbia lifts off on a mission to retrieve a
scientific satellite. The flight had been scheduled for Dec. 18,
but its launch pad was being refurbished and not ready. Bad weather
delayed a Jan. 8 launch attempt.
   Feb. 28 - Atlantis is sent on a secret military mission
following five delays due to bad weather and the commander's cold.
It was one delay short of tying the record for launch
postponements.
   April 24 - Discovery is launched with the Hubble Space
Telescope. An April 10 launch attempt had been halted with four
minutes to go because of a faulty valve in a hydraulic power unit.
   May 29 - NASA called off Columbia's May 30 launch attempt after
hydrogen leaked during fueling. It was the first countdown for the
astronomy mission.
   Aug. 30 - NASA halted Columbia's second countdown, canceling a
Sept. 1 launch attempt, because of a failed electronic part on one
of four telescopes inside the shuttle.
   Sept. 5 - NASA called off Columbia's Sept. 6 launch attempt
after hydrogen flooded the aft compartment during fueling. Launch
was rescheduled for Sept. 18.

   A teen-ager described as troubled and
rebellious faces four counts of murder in connection with a weekend
shooting rampage that left his grandparents and two other relatives
dead.
   John Morrell Frierson, 17, was arrested without incident Sunday
morning, said Pearl River County Sheriff Lorance Lumpkin. He was
scheduled to face charges as an adult today on four counts of
capital murder, two counts of rape and two counts of armed robbery,
Lumpkin said.
   The sheriff identified the murder victims as Frierson's
grandparents, Ray Merle Frierson, 61, and Molly M. Frierson, 57;
his brother, Josh Morrell, 13; and his aunt, Pam Howard, 38. His
grandparents had adopted him and raised him, authorities said.
   The sheriff said all four were killed by multiple gunshot wounds
to the upper body and that both women were raped. One victim was
severely beaten, Lumpkin said. Two guns believed used in the attack
were recovered at the Frierson home.
   Lumpkin said the bodies were found at the house about 9 p.m.
Saturday by relatives who became concerned when they couldn't reach
anybody by phone.
   ``They feared something like this ... had happened,'' Lumpkin
said.
   He said the shooting appeared to result from a ``buildup of
frustration and rebellion of the boy.''
   The youth was arrested at a friend's house about 1 a.m. Sunday
and was held at the Pearl River County Jail.
   Lumpkin said the Sheriff's Department was also holding another
17-year-old in connection with the case, but so far that individual
had not been charged. The second person's name was not released.

   Police clashed today with hundreds of
people protesting U.S. military bases on the eve of talks on their
future.
   At least 17 people were arrested and seven injured when police
broke up rallies in front of the U.S. Embassy. The demonstrators
urged the government to close Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller U.S. installations when their lease expires
in September 1991.
   In a nationwide address, President Corazon Aquino said the
U.S-Philippine talks beginning Tuesday will focus not only on the
bases but also on the relationship between the United States and
this former American territory.
   ``In a world where the Cold War has ended, and events in eastern
Europe and the Middle East have altered the traditional
geopolitical order, the decades-old parameters of the relationship
no longer hold,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``The old cannot continue; the new must now be born,'' she
added. ``This new relationship shall be the subject of the talks
that begin tomorrow.''
   During the first round of talks in May, the two sides agreed to
continue negotiations on a new bases agreement. Former Assistant
Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage arrived today to lead the
American panel.
   Early today, about 350 protesters marched to the U.S. Embassy
but were driven away by police after some in the crowd hurled small
homemade bombs.
   A bigger group of about 1,000 returned late in the afternoon but
police again blocked their march about 600 feet from the embassy.
   Anti-bases activists plan to stage a series of demonstrations
during the bases talks. Any new agreement would have to be approved
by the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the facilities is
strong.
   The 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian
employees have been restricted to their bases to avoid incidents
during the talks.

<TEXT>
   The entire population of Chidester -
about 345 people - was evacuated this morning when a Union Pacific
train derailed and a car containing nitric acid began to leak,
authorities said.
   Ten cars of the 51-car train went off the tracks near downtown
Chidester, in Ouachita County in southern Arkansas, about 4:45
a.m., said Mark Davis, a spokesman for the railroad. Chidester is
84 miles southwest of Little Rock.
   Gary Talley of the state Office of Emergency Services said
leaking cars contained nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. The
evacuation was a precautionary measure, and no injuries were
reported, Talley said.
   Nitric acid is corrosive to metals and tissue, according to a
hazardous materials book at the OES. Prolonged exposure to low
concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may be
harmful to health, it said.
   Talley said the substance is non-combustible, but will
accelerate the burning of combustible materials.
   The ammonium nitrate is a fertilizer, Talley said.
   A State Police Hazardous Materials Team was dispatched to the
site along with local and regional OES officials, and members of
the Chidester and Camden fire departments, officials said.

   Britain expelled eight staff members from the
Iraqi Embassy and ordered the deportation of 23 other Iraqi
citizens today in what Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called a
gesture of solidarity with European allies.
   The action came as the 12 European Community nations decided to
expel military attaches and restrict the movements of other
diplomats to protest Iraqi raids last week on European embassy
compounds in Kuwait.
   The Foreign Office said that two military attaches and six
support staff were being expelled from the Iraqi Embassy in
retaliation for the Iraqi intrusions.
   The Home Office later announced that 23 Iraqi nationals were
being deported for reasons of national security. The names and
occupations of those people were not disclosed.
   Hurd announced the action against the diplomatic staff in
Brussels, Belgium, where he was attending a meeting of European
Community foreign ministers.
   ``This all arises because I feel, the government feels, that
we've got to act in solidarity with the French and the other
countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out
during the last few days,'' Hurd said in an interview relayed to
London by the government's information office.
   A reporter asked Hurd if there was a danger that new sanctions
could worsen the crisis.
   ``There is always a danger,'' Hurd said. ``But there is also a
danger of letting these things happen and accepting them as if they
were tolerable. They are not tolerable.
   ``Just as we have taken action against the Iraqis over their
treatment of hostages in general, so we have taken action in this
respect,'' Hurd said.
   On Friday, Iraqi troops stormed the residence of the French
ambassador in Kuwait City, seizing four French citizens, including
a military attache. The attache was later released, but the
whereabouts of the other three remained unknown.
   Dutch, Belgian and Canadian diplomatic compounds in Kuwait also
were raided last week by Iraqi troops. The embassy raids were
unanimously condemned Sunday by the U.N. Security Council.
   France announced the ispatch of 4,000 additional troops to the
Persian Gulf region and expelled 29 Iraqis in retaliation. Italy
announced it was ousting all officials at the Iraqi military
attache's office in Rome.
   In Paris, Iraq's ambassador today accused French authorities of
maltreating military trainees who were expelled from France over
the weekend. Pressed to give examples, Ambassador Abdul Razzak
al-Hashimi told a news conference that some of the Iraqis were
shoved.
   France and Britain are among more than a dozen nations,
including the United States, which have refused Iraqi orders to
remove their diplomats from Kuwait.
   Hurd complained about the treatment of diplomats in the besieged
country.
   ``They are surrounded by soldiers, they can't get food or drink
in, they can't get oil in. Their position is gradually getting
worse. They've been blockaded since the end of August.
   ``So all the Western embassies are in the same boat. The Iraqis
have taken one step further, and we have to react accordingly,'' he
said.
   Hurd said there was support among the EC ministers for an air
blockade of Iraq. But he said it was important to obtain backing
from the U.N. Security Council for such a move, as was done for the
naval blockade.

   Two young gunners stood in front of the
twin beige behemoths that will be their metallic camels of the
desert - M1A1 battle tanks dubbed ``Hound Dog'' and ``Hollywood''
being inspected for duty in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I love tanks,'' confesses Spec. 5 Joseph Barajas of Modesto,
Calif. ``I can't wait to get there - start gettin' those T-72s in
my sights.''
   Barajas and his sergeant, Michael Duda of Glendale, Calif., were
as eager to show off their tanks as if they were their shiny new
sports cars.
   ``Right now, we're focusing all our attention on getting
maintenance of the vehicles, to make sure they're ready,'' Duda
said. There was a flurry of activity around the two tanks as Duda's
unit prepared to leave this capital of tankdom, the largest center
of armored weaponry in the free world.
   ``We just got back from Calfax training - that's the best. We're
really ready to go,'' Duda said of a training exercise his unit had
just undergone.
   Duda and Barajas' armored machines are designed to ferret out
and destroy their Soviet counterpart - the T-72 - in use by
President Saddam Hussein's heavily mechanized Iraqi divisions.
   The 67-ton tanks are revered by their crews because they can
keep a target in sight while the 1,500 horsepower turbine engine
moves flat out at 42 mph. With the tank's laser range finders,
ballistic computer, thermal-imaging night site and wind sensors,
the gunners can see through darkness, fog and dust to blast the
insides out of any armored opponent.
   Such a love of tanks inspired Barajas to volunteer for duty in
Saudi Arabia and turn down a transfer to the lush green hills of
Bamberg, West Germany.
   ``I couldn't go to Germany and leave these guys go off without
me,'' Barajas explained. ``This is what I've been training all my
time in the Army for.''
   The 25-year-old soldier said he'd sent his wife and three
children back home to be with family while he was away. But
goodbyes weren't easy.
   ``My oldest son, he's five, he said to me, `Daddy, don't worry.
You won't die,''' he said. ``Can you believe that?''
   Asked whether any of the soldiers in the unit were afraid of
what they might encounter, Barajas said a few had admitted to such
qualms over some barbecue and beers the night before.
   ``But you'd be crazy if you didn't feel a little bit of that,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   The official press mocked President Bush's
broadcast message to the Iraqi people, saying Monday that he
``failed in his first test'' to convince them that Saddam Hussein
was to blame for the Persian Gulf crisis.
   One Baghdad newspaper, commenting on Bush's eight-minute message
broadcast nationally Sunday evening, said: ``Mr. Bush ... please
shut up.''
   Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of the ruling Baath Party,
said: ``Iraq, its leader and the Arab nation are but one state with
one will, a will having a firm determination to score victory and
purge the land of Arabs from any presence offending their
sovereignty and dignity.''
   In his videotaped message, recorded at the White House and with
Arab subtitles and and an Arab voice-over, Bush said: ``Saddam
Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and
America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world.''
   The Iraqi army newspaper Al-Qadissiyah replied Monday that ``it
is evident that Bush, who is the president of a state which claims
the leadership of the world, has failed in his first test with the
Iraqi people.''
   Al-Thawra said the speech was ``an attempt to distort facts and
reverse the true nature of the conflict under cover of
international legitimacy.''
   ``If Washington prepares for a military action against Iraq, the
Iraqis, backed by all Arabs, Moslems and honorable citizens all
around the world, are quite ready to defend their land, sovereignty
and rights,'' Al-Thawra said.
   Bush is ``the direct enemy whose forces were desecrating Mecca
and the tomb of the prophet in a futile effort to threaten Iraq,''
it said.
   Other newspapers joined the chorus ridiculing Bush for saying
President Saddam Hussein was pushing the country toward a war.
   One also printed a presidential decree formally dissolving the
Kuwait Airways Corp., the flagship air carrier of the emirate
Saddam invaded Aug. 2 and then annexed.
   Bush's speech triggered anti-American demonstrations in the
streets of Baghdad, with thousands marching and chanting, ``Death
to Bush! Death to America!''
   In a front-page commentary headlined ``The Illusions of Mr.
Bush,'' the state daily Al-Jumhuriya said: ``Once again the
president of the United States fails to understand the mentality
and psychology of the Iraqi people.
   ``Instead of correcting his previous mistakes, Bush wants to
push the (conflict) to the abyss of untold catastrophes.''
   Another article in the newspaper, headlined ``Shut up, Mr.
Bush'' said: ``America today is a bastion of oppression and we have
this to say: `Mr. Bush, we listened to your message, but please
shut up.'''
   Al-Qadissiyah said Bush was ``playing a new game'' of
CIA-inspired psychological warfare. It challenged Bush's claim that
he spoke on behalf of the international community.
   ``By that we understand that Bush wants to say that he has a
mandate to carry out his aggression against Iraq,'' the paper said.
``But we know that the decision to go to war with Iraq is purely
American.''
   Al-Qadissiyah published a decree by Saddam that formally
dissolved Kuwait Airways and transferred all its assets to the
government-run Iraqi Airways. The decree also dissolved all Kuwait
Airways offices abroad and dismissed its personnel.
   Several Kuwait Airways planes have already been moved to Baghdad
and repainted in the green and white colors of Iraqi Airways.
   Kuwaiti authorities in exile managed to salvage some of Kuwait
Airways' 22 aircraft and have set up a new headquarters for the
airline in Cairo.

   A woman who says she ``fussed at my
husband every time he bought some tickets'' was among the winners
to step forward today and claim their share of a record $106.5
million jackpot.
   Six Florida Lottery tickets matched the winning numbers drawn
Saturday night after a week of feverish buying, some of it by
people who drove or flew in from out of state or plunked down
thousands of dollars trying to improve their odds from 1 in 14
million. Two of the winners appeared at a news conference this
morning.
   Jeanne Piasecki of New Smyrna Beach said her family was
splitting the winnings. She added smilingly: ``I still don't
believe in gambling. I fussed at my husband every time he bought
some tickets.''
   Another winning ticket holder, Pat Landry of Sorrento in Lake
County, said her winning entry, bought by her daughter in Longwood,
was divided among a dozen family members and friends.
   She said she was glad their were six grand prize winners because
it helped keep the attention on her family to a minimum.
   ``Who needs $106 million?'' she commented.
   Both ticket winners said the numbers were picked at random.
   The jackpot, estimated at $105 million Sunday, was calculated
today at $106.5 million - a state record and second largest in U.S.
history. Each of the six tickets is thus worth $17.75 million over
20 years, or about $887,500 a year before taxes.
   The other four winners didn't immediately step forward. Lottery
computers show the other winning tickets were bought in Miami,
Coconut Creek, Venice and Winter Haven.
   The winners matched all six numbers drawn: 05-06-21-34-35-45.
   Some of the umpteen million losers had plenty to say, too.
   ``I just lost miserably,'' said Victor Morgan, who bought two
tickets. ``But I've wasted my money on worse things.''
   Jennifer Kram, who matched just three numbers on one of her 20
tickets, said, ``I'm very depressed. Three isn't good enough for
me. I wanted at least $500,000.'' The three-number match will bring
her a grand total of $5.50.
   The prize had snowballed for four weeks, growing with each
week's drawing every time no one won the jackpot. Only a $115
million jackpot in Pennsylvania last year has been higher. But in
that drawing, 14 winning tickets were sold.
   More than 100 million $1 tickets were sold, at up to 44,500 a
minute.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul hinted at the exhaustion the week
had brought.
   ``I think we're glad it's over,'' she said. ``But it's been fun
and exciting.''
   State economists planned to meet today to calculate how much
extra money education will reap. Education, like the rest of state
government, is facing a 5 percent spending cutback because of a
shortfall in revenue.
   By law, half of every dollar spent on a Florida lottery ticket
is paid out in prizes. At least 38.5 percent goes to education, and
the rest to retailers and administration.
   The U.S. record for a lottery prize to a single winner is held
by Florida, which awarded a woman almost $55.2 million after a
drawing two years ago.

Arts expressed hope Monday that ``the crisis will soon pass'' over
federal support for controversial art with a Senate proposal to let
the courts decide whether works are obscene.
   But chairman John E. Frohnmayer held fast, at least for a while
longer, to his much-criticized requirement that NEA grant
recipients sign a pledge not to use federal funds to produce art
that might be considered obscene.
   Even though the pledge was prompted by a congressional obscenity
ban that will expire Sept. 30, Frohnmayer said he will keep the
pledge until a federal court in New York issues a ruling on its
constitutionality and Congress decides whether to impose new
anti-obscenity restrictions on the endowment.
   In any case, the embattled NEA chairman said there was ``zero
truth'' to rumors that he may resign in the heat of battle over
past endowment support for works that conservative critics have
denounced as obscene and sacrilegious.
   At a news conference at the National Press Club, Frohnmayer said
he was ``heartened'' by two events last week.
   One was a report by a bipartisan study commission that backed
the endowment, opposed anti-obscenity curbs and called for reforms
in the NEA's grant procedures.
   The other was the emergence of a Senate compromise that shifts
the burden of deciding cases of ``obscene art'' from the NEA to the
courts.
   Both developments, Frohnmayer said, ``give us hope that the
crisis will soon pass.''
   The Senate bill, approved 15-1 last week by the Labor and Human
Resources Committee, provides ``a wise solution to a very thorny
problem,'' Frohnmayer said.
   The measure, now headed for Senate floor action, would allow the
endowment to get its money back if a grant recipient is convicted
of creating works that violate obscenity or child pornography laws.
The guilty artist would be forbidden to receive further NEA grants
for at least three years.
   ``We await the action of Congress with the hope that clear
thinking and cool heads prevail,'' Frohnmayer said.
   Frohnmayer outlines several internal reforms at the federal arts
agency to make its grant procedures more responsive to the desires
of the tax-paying public. But he conceded that his reforms ``won't
satisfy those who don't want an arts endowment.''
   Both the study commission and the National Council on the Arts,
the presidentially appointed advisory body to the endowment, have
urged that Frohnmayer eliminate his anti-obscenity pledge, which
has stirred widespread protests in the arts community.
   The Senate committee also is expected to suggest that the pledge
be dropped when it issues its formal report on the bill, which
would extend the NEA's life for five years beyond Sept. 30, when
its statutory authority expires.
   Also expiring that day will be a ban on NEA support for works
that ``may be considered obscene,'' specifically including
depictions of homoeroticism, sadomasochism and the sexual
exploitation of children.
   Congress attached the ban to the endowment's current $171
million budget last October at the urging of conservative lawmakers
led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who had protested NEA grants for
exhibitions of works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano.
   Since Frohnmayer instituted the anti-obscenity pledge in
November, a dozen artists and arts organizations have forfeited NEA
grants rather than sign the pledge. Three lawsuits filed against
the endowment in federal courts in New York and Los Angeles charge
that the pledge violates First Amendment guarantees of freedom of
expression.
   Frohnmayer said Monday he won't decide whether to eliminate the
pledge until he knows what Congress and the courts have to say
about the ``obscene art'' issue in the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Murder Trial Begins 17 Months After Rampage Left Seven Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramon Salcido went on trial for his
life today, 17 months after his wife, two daughters and four others
were shot or stabbed to death in a murderous rampage through
California's wine country.
   Salcido admits the slayings, but a jury will decide if the
29-year-old winery worker is guilty of first-degree murder or, as
his lawyer argues, was not mentally capable of such an intentional
act.
   Salcido could face the gas chamber if convicted.
   The prosecution argues that Salcido planned and willfully
carried out seven killings - including three in-laws and a
co-worker - and tried to kill three other people, and therefore
should be convicted of first-degree murder and attempted murder.
   ``These were coldly calculated crimes,'' says Peter Bumerts,
chief deputy district attorney in Sonoma County, where the slayings
occurred on April 14, 1989. He planned to rely principally on
Salcido's tape-recorded confession to detectives.
   Salcido's lawyer, Marteen Miller, planned to concede that
Salcido killed the victims and tried to kill the three survivors.
   ``That puts at issue his state of mind,'' he said.
   Miller, the Sonoma County public defender, will argue that
Salcido was in a ``psychotic depression'' and high on cocaine and
champagne, and mentally incapable of the planning or intent
required for a conviction of first-degree murder.
   The trial, moved to San Mateo County Superior Court because of
intensive news coverage in Sonoma, is expected to last about a
month.
   Salcido is charged with fatally shooting his wife, Angela, 24,
in the couple's Boyes Hot Springs duplex, and cutting the throats
of their three young daughters and leaving them for dead at a dump.
Carmina, then 2, survived and told detectives: ``Dad hurt me.''
   He also is accused of fatally stabbing his mother-in-law, Marian
Richards, 47, and killing two of her daughters, and with shooting
to death a co-worker at the Grand Cru winery in Glen Ellen.
   Salcido was charged with attempted murder in the attack on
Carmina, the shooting of a co-worker and an attempt to shoot the
man's wife.
   If the jury convicts Salcido of first-degree murder and finds
true the special-circumstance allegation of multiple murder, a
second phase of the trial would be held to determine if he should
be executed or be sentenced to life in prison without possibility
of parole.

   Gen. Mike Dugan was fired as Air Force chief
of staff today following the four-star general's blunt comments
about U.S. contingency plans for massive air strikes against
Baghdad.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney relieved Dugan of his duties after
consulting with President Bush, and then delivered a harsh critique
of the 53-year-old decorated flier.
   ``There are certain things we never talk about. We never discuss
operational matters, such as the selection of specific targets for
potential air strikes,'' Cheney told reporters.
   ``We never talk about the targeting of specific individuals, who
are officials in other governments. That is an violation of the
executive order,'' the secretary said.
   ``We never underestimate the strength of opposing forces or
reveal previously classified information about the size or
disposition of U.S. forces. Nor do we ever demean the contributions
of the other services,'' he said.
   ``Gen. Dugan's statements as reported in the press and as
confirmed by him to me - failed all of those tests,'' Cheney said.
   The Pentagon's rare disciplinary action of a top officer came
one day after published reports quoted Dugan as saying U.S.
military authorities had concluded that massive air strikes are the
only effective way of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait if war erupted.
Dugan was on a tour of U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia
when he made his comments in an interview with the Los Angeles
Times and The Washington Post.
   Atop the Dugan interview in the Los Angeles Times, the paper
quoted unnamed ``senior U.S. military planners'' as saying that
such an air campaign would be designed in part to ``decapitate''
the Iraqi leadership by targeting Saddam Hussein, his family, his
senior commanders and his palace guard.
   The paper quoted Dugan as saying that ``a better list'' of
high-value Iraqi targets had been drawn up by military planners.
The paper said, ``the list stressed the importance of attacking
Hussein and his inner circle, but beyond that Dugan would not
detail'' any target points.
   Dugan still retains his four-star rank, but he is expected to
retire.
   ``Protocol demands that he retire,'' a Pentagon source said.
``There's no job in the Air Force he could really hold now.''
   Dugan flew combat missions during the Vietnam War, and later
taught cadet military training courses at the Air Force Academy.
   He was named assistant deputy chief of staff at Air Force
headquarters in January 1987, and six months later he became Air
Force deputy chief of staff for programs and resources.
   Dugan was promoted to the joint position of commander of U.S.
Air Forces in Europe and commander of Allied Air Forces Central
Europe, headquartered at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, in April
1989.
   His military decorations include the Distinguished Service
Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished
Flying Cross and the Purple Heart.
   Pending the choice of Gen. Dugan's successor, the vice chief of
staff, Gen. John Michael Loh, will act as the top commander of the
Air Force.
   Cheney told reporters, ``Mike Dugan is a fine officer with an
outstanding record of service in the United States Air Force and to
the nation. Relieving him is not a pleasant task but I felt it was
a necessary one.''
   Cheney said there are 150,000 U.S. combat troops in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``They may be engaged in hostilities in the very near future. A
very fragile, very important international coalition has been put
together to halt Saddam Hussein's aggression,'' Cheney said.
   ``Under those circumstances,'' he added, ``the conduct of U.S.
national security policy is an extremely delicate task.'' He said
Dugan's statement ``did not, in my mind, reveal an understanding of
the situation or of what is expected of him as a member of the
joint chiefs.''
   Dugan's office said he was not at work today and was unavailable
for comment.
   Dugan's attempts at openness - a major change for top Air Force
generals - appeared to contribute to his undoing.
   Shortly after taking over from Gen. Larry Welch in July, Dugan
began an aggressive campaign to meet with reporters and deal openly
with some of the service's sore points on Capitol Hill.
   The service had been battered by congressional budget battles
over the B-2 Stealth aircraft and problems with the performance of
the F-117A Stealth bomber during the Panama invasion.
   Dugan raised a few eyebrows inside the Pentagon last week when
he traveled to Saudi Arabia before the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff - Gen. Colin Powell - had a chance to visit with the
troops.
   Commanders on the ground in Saudi Arabia have been critical of
Dugan for several weeks because of his open assessment of U.S.
military capabilities.
   Powell's aides said last week Dugan was one of several people
who have been talking too much.
   ``Saddam already has you guys giving away the store, we don't
need to help him any more,'' one Powell aide said privately.
   Pentagon officials said Dugan appeared to be the second member
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be relieved of his duties.
   In 1949, President Truman relieved the Chief of Naval
Operations, Adm. Louis E. Denfeld.
   Truman took the action upon the recommendation of the Secretary
of the Navy, who'd asserted that the admiral had lost control of
his command.
   Denfeld's dismissal, according to a New York Times account
printed the day after the president's action, came two weeks after
the admiral had complained to Congress that the Navy was being
``starved'' in order to support the Air Force's bombing mission.

   Young Kuwaiti men trying to flee their occupied homeland were
seized today by Iraqi troops, refugees reported, and their sobbing
wives and daughters were forced to cross into Saudi Arabia without
them.
   The Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Mike Dugan, was fired today
because of his frank comments about U.S. contingency plans for air
strikes on Baghdad.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Dugan violated Pentagon rules
barring discussion of the selection of targets for possible
military strikes and revealed classified information about the
strength of U.S. forces in the gulf.
   While touring U.S. military sites in Saudi Arabia on Sunday,
Dugan said massive air strikes would be the only effective way to
force Iraq out of Kuwait in a war. He was quoted by The Washington
Post and the Los Angeles Times.
   In Iraq, state-run newspapers today heaped scorn on President
Bush for his broadcast warning to the Iraqis that their president,
Saddam Hussein, is leading them to war. One newspaper's headline
read: ``Shut up, Mr. Bush.''
   ``Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle
between Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world,''
Bush said in his speech, aired Sunday on Iraqi television.
   Standing in front of his Oval Office desk with the American flag
behind him, Bush urged Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait,
which it overran on Aug. 2.
   Iraqi authorities responded that Bush's statement was full of
``lies and contradictions.'' They said the U.S. president aimed to
be ``dictator of the world.''
   Thousands of protesters gathered in the streets of Baghdad's
capital after Bush's broadcast, chanting ``Death to Bush! Death to
America!''
   International opposition to Iraq, however, picked up strength.
   Britain said today it would expel the Iraqi military attache and
three aides from the embassy in London. Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd indicated the Home Office would be annoucing further sanctions
against Iraq later in the day.
   Belgium restricted the mobility of Iraq's diplomatic personnel.
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it was summoning Iraq's
ambassador today, and Dutch television reported a cutback in the
Iraqi mission and restrictions of its diplomats' freedom of
movement were imminent.
   The moves came after Dutch, French, Belgian and Canadian
embassies or diplomatic residences were raided last week by Iraqi
troops. The embassy raids were unanimously condemned Sunday by the
U.N. Security Council.
   France on Sunday expelled 29 Iraqis in retaliation, and Italy
announced it was ousting all officials at the Iraqi military
attache's office in Rome.
   Twelve member nations of the European Community, meeting today
in Brussels, Belgium, were also weighing a possible air blockade of
Iraq to enforce a U.N. trade embargo.
   ``Everybody was arguing for an air blockade,'' said the Belgian
foreign affairs minister, Mark Eyskens.
   The ministers were also considering new economic steps against
Iraq and more aid for countries hurt by the U.N.-ordered embargo on
trade with that counry.
   U.N. diplomats on Sunday began drafting a new resolution to
close off Iraq's air routes and punish nations flouting the
U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq, U.S. officials said.
   An Egyptian military source said Egypt will send 250 soldiers to
Saudi Arabia today and more will follow in a few days, joining the
estimated 4,000 Egyptian troops already in the region. The source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Egypt would also send
Egytian tanks, armored personel carriers and air defense systems to
Saudi Arabia by ship across the Red Sea.
   Meanwhile, Japan's first mission of doctors, nurses and support
staff was preparing today to leave for Saudi Arabia Tuesday to lay
groundwork for a planned 100-member Japanese medical team,
officials said. Japan has pledged a total of $4 billion to the
U.S.-led multinational effort against Iraq, but recruitment of
medical personnel has been slow.
   Moscow announced today it would restore diplomatic ties with
Saudi Arabia, cut in 1938. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al
Saud, also called for the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait, the official Tass news agency said.
   Tass quoted Shevardnadze as saying the formalities of
re-establishing ties would be finalized after the Saudi minister
met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviets had
been longtime allies of Baghdad, but became cool to Iraq after
Saddam seized Kuwait.
   At the lone border crossing between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
about 6,000 Kuwaitis streamed out of their homeland over the
weekend after Iraq troops suddenly and without explanation opened
the crossing. It had been shut for a month.
   But refugees arriving today said Iraqi troops manning the border
crossing were seizing all Kuwaiti males between the ages of 17 and
36, apparently because they were of age to serve in the military.
And all non-Kuwaitis, except for a few Western women married to
Kuwaitis, were turned back by the Iraqis and told to leave Kuwait
through Baghdad.
   The Kuwaiti government-in-exile called the unannounced weekend
exodus evidence that Saddam intends to depopulate Kuwait and move
in his own people.
   In a move consolidating their control of Kuwait, Iraqi
authorities announced today that they ordered the dissolution of
Kuwait Airways, that country's flagship air carrier.
   There was concern that the Iraqis might be trying to send spies
or terrorists into Saudi Arabia, where 100,000 U.S. troops have
deployed since the invasion of Kuwait, leading a multinational
force. Refugees without proper identity documents were being
questioned carefully by Saudi authorities.
   The Kuwaiti refugees told tales of terror and anarchy at home,
of dwindling food supplies and Iraqi troops blowing up the homes of
suspected resistance fighters in Kuwait City.
   Meanwhile, the flow of Arab and Asian refugees from the Persian
Gulf region continued unabated. Air India's top executive said the
airline is ferrying 3,000 Indians a day from the region, making it
one of the world's largest-ever civil evacuations.
   Subhas R. Gupte, the chairman of the state-owned airline, said
45,000 Indians have been flown home. About 190,000 Indians were in
Kuwait and Iraq at the time of the invasion.
   Bush's address to the Iraqi people, with an Arabic voice-over
and captions provided by the State Department, was apparently
broadcast in its entirety Sunday evening. It was the first direct
message from Bush to the Iraqi.
   In a commentary today headlined ``Shut up, Mr. Bush,'' the Iraqi
government-owned Al-Jumhuriya, or The Republic, declared, ``America
today is a bastion of oppression and we have this to say: `Mr.
Bush, we listened to your message, but please shut up.'''
   The speech was followed immediately by a 25-minute response from
an Iraqi TV announcer, who said a ``thundering rage'' is building
against the United States in the Arab world, and a showdown in the
Persian Gulf would end ``in a catastrophe'' for U.S. forces.
   A few hundred men later took to the streets of Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital. As they passed through residential neighborhoods,
thousands of men, women and children joined them.
   Raising clenched fists, the demonstrators denounced Bush. They
also called President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia ``traitors of the Arab world'' for siding with the United
States in the confrontation.

   Some people live life in the fast lane.
Tiffany Paula Brickner began her's there.
   The 4-pound, 2-ounce girl was born Sunday in the front seat of a
Chevrolet traveling about 85 mph, according to Pauline Hollencamp,
the newborn's aunt.
   ``I thought I had plenty of time to get to the hospital,'' said
mother Hilda Freed of Beaver Falls.
   The two women were at church when Ms. Freed, 25, realized she
was in labor. The hospital was about 15 miles away and the baby's
father, Robert Brickner, was at work.
   Mrs. Hollencamp, a 24-year-old mother of two who has training in
natural childbirth, served as driver and coach for her sister.
   ``I just kept telling her to breathe. That's the best thing for
the unborn baby is to breathe,'' Mrs. Hollencamp said.
   ``She coached me the whole way,'' said Ms. Freed. ``She told me
not to push, but I couldn't avoid that. I knew the baby was on its
way and there's nothing I could do.''
   Just after Tiffany's birth, Mrs. Hollencamp pulled into a state
police barracks parking lot and ran inside for help. Troopers
covered the baby and mother with blankets and called an ambulance.
   Despite being underweight, Tiffany was reported in good
condition at Medical Center of Beaver.

   A senior aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Monday
that competing reform programs now under debate are designed to
``give momentum'' to the transition to a market economy but will
not fully transform the system.
   Nikolai Petrakov, meeting with The Associated Press board of
directors and executives, also acknowledged that Soviet politics
were in a state of crisis as old-line communists and bureaucrats
battle reform.
   President Gorbachev further confused the political scene Monday
by telling parliament he wanted a referendum on one of the
fundamental tenets of economic reform - legalizing the private
ownership of farm land and other real estate.
   The parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest republic
in the country with more than half its people and two-thirds of its
territory, already has passed a reform plan that would
decollectivize agriculture.
   ``The situation we have now is the situation of a government in
crisis. I really don't know how this crisis is going to be
resolved,'' Petrakov said.
   Petrakov said he hoped for a compromise that would ``have as a
starting point a really severe blow against monopolies.''
   ``We want to give this process momentum. We certainly do not
expect it to be completed in 500 days. ... We need to create
conditions for competition ... one of the most important conditions
for a market economy.''
   But he said the reform package favored by Gorbachev would not
make the ruble convertible against Western currencies.
   ``I do not think we will be able to attain full convertibility
within 500 days,'' he said. But he said that the package would
include ``guarantees'' that foreign investors would be able to take
their Soviet profits outside the Soviet Union in the form of hard
currencies - a major incentive for attracting capital.
   Efforts to reform the national economy, he said, had been
complicated by declarations of independence or sovereignty by 13 of
the 15 Soviet republics since March.
   ``The process of sovereignty looks like a joke or more like a
musical comedy,'' he said.
   Most of the Soviet republics have declared control over major
state enterprises and natural resources on their territory, plus
the right to create their own central banks and issue their own
currency.
   ``Many of the republics want to erect customs control on the
borders between the two republics,'' he complained.
   He said economic union among the republics should be based on
four fundamentals: a single central bank, a single currency, the
ability of the central government to levy taxes and maintenance of
a single customs agency.
   Maintaining the economic union was crucial, he said. Since the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the relations among suppliers and
industries across the nation have grown to such a degree that ``no
republic can live without the others.''
   Lithuania, the republic that has gone furthest in declaring its
political independence from the Soviet Union, has expressed
interest in a new form of economic union, he said.
   ``The republics are prepared to waive their right for
independent currency if we are able to create a stable monetary
system,'' because that is a fundamental for a sound economy, he
said.
   ``Of course, it is true that an economic union would be
voluntary. Any republic would be free to exist as an independent
state'' and would maintain economic ties with the other republics
``like relations with the countries of Eastern Europe.''

   Like many parents with college-age
youngsters, David and Jean Heard like to send care packages when
their children are away from home.
   But for the Heard children, the classroom is the Persian Gulf
and their instruction could mean the difference between life and
death.
   Since President Bush ordered American troops to the Middle East
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, three of the Heards' 13
sons and daughters have been caught up in the deployment.
   One son is a Marine in Saudi Arabia. Another, a sailor, is
aboard the carrier Independence in the Persian Gulf. A daughter and
her husband, both in the military reserves, remain in the United
States but believe they'll be sent to the Middle East.
   Mrs. Heard said she could not sit idle while she waited for news
from abroad. So she and her husband, a retired Marine, started
``Operation Something From Home.''
   Their mission is to see that every serviceman and woman involved
in Operation Desert Shield gets something from home.
   ``We have read over the years how military personnel never get a
letter, never get anything,'' Mrs. Heard said. ``My God, these are
our children. They're all our sons and daughters. And the least we
can do is to get something to them.''
   What began from humble beginnings - a few dollars and a couple
of packages a week - has grown into a nationwide effort, all from
the basement of the Heards' Manassas home. Boxes are everywhere,
brimming with articles from chewing gum and crackers to toilet
tissue and paperback novels.
   Nearly a dozen volunteers shuttle back and forth. Some operate
the telephone, others are assigned as ``shoppers'' who buy items to
ship to the armed forces.
   Donations are pouring in, as are letters of support. A real
estate company in the Virgin Islands sent a $50 check. An envelope
from an anonymous sender arrived last week with a $100 bill tucked
inside.
   Aaron Clark, a fourth-grader from Mount Vernon, Ill., created
his own care package with a small box of cigars, a roll of candy
and a paperback novel. He sent it to the Heards with hopes that
they would forward it to the troops.
   Other packages include razors, lip balm, liquid soap, playing
cards, wooden dominoes and letters from school children. All items
being sent have been tested and shown to be desert-proof.
   Mrs. Heard puts the items in the back window of her car for two
days. If they don't melt, they're included.
   The packages aren't sent to individuals by name, but are sent to
APO and FPO boxes that correspond with those of soldiers in the
Persian Gulf region.
   The packs are getting through. David Heard, 55, got a thank you
letter from a soldier of the 82nd Airborne Division, who sent a $1
contribution.
   ``The care package service is going to be a real morale
booster,'' wrote another soldier in Saudi Arabia. ``We are all over
here for our country. We will die for our country. And if I die,
I'll be proud within myself that I died for my country.''
   The letters they get from the recipients of the packages are
reward enough for those involved in Operation Something From Home.
   ``That's worth 20 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Mrs. Heard
said. ``When I get tired or discouraged, I read those letters and
I'm no longer tired. I only wish there were 40 hours in a day.''
   In a way, the effort is helping heal some old hurts left by the
Vietnam War, she said. The home-spun packages are a lifeline for
those deployed to the Persian Gulf and a way to show them that they
are being supported back home.
   ``Do you remember when our people came back from Vietnam?'' Mrs.
Heard asked. ``It was no longer an honor to wear a uniform. They
were spit at and rotten vegetables were thrown at them.
   ``I am ashamed that I was one of those Americans who didn't
stand up and do anything,'' she said. ``I was a coward and I did
nothing. This country in 30 years has suffered so much. There just
didn't seem to be any unity. And now if you read these letters...
   ``God Bless America - warts and all,'' Mrs. Heard said.

<HEAD>Rising Inventories, Declining Sales, Raise Apprehensions</HEAD>

   Business inventories jumped 0.7 percent in
July, the biggest pileup in a year, while sales slumped 0.5
percent, the government said Monday, causing some apprehension over
the amount of goods held on shelves and back lots.
   Although the level of inventories is not recessionary, Robert
Brusca, chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York, said surging stockpiles are a
danger sign.
   ``When inventories rise faster than sales, particularly when
sales are in a lagging mode, it's reasonable to assume you're going
to see cutbacks in manufacturing output,'' he said. That could
result in growing unemployment.
   The Commerce Department said inventories in July totaled a
seasonally adjusted $801.9 billion, up from $796.5 billion in June.
It was the biggest increase since a 0.8 percent gain in July 1989.
   The June backlog had declined a revised 0.5 percent from the
previous month, rather than the 0.4 percent originally reported.
   Sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $539.5
billion, down from $542.4 billion a month earlier. The June sales
also were revised to a weaker 0.6 percent gain, rather than the 1.0
percent advance first reported.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington,
Mass., noted that sales rose only on the retail level in July but
pointed out that retail sales deteriorated in August, falling 0.6
percent, according to a Commerce Department report last week.
   And while retail sales increased 0.4 percent in July, the gain
was less than half of the 1.1 percent jump the previous month.
Retail sales represent about half of all consumer spending which
itself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   The combination of falling sales and rising inventories produced
a 1.49 ratio of inventories to sales, up from 1.47 in June and the
same as May's 1.49. The ratio means it would take 1.49 months to
exhaust the backlog of goods at the July sales pace.
   Neither Brusca nor Ms. Latta believe the ratio is dangerously
high.
   ``But with evidence that retail selling is weak and that output
is falling, to have inventories building is not a good sign for the
economy,'' Brusca said.
   All major business categories experienced gains in inventories.
Manufacturing backlogs were up 0.7 percent to $373.3 billion.
Wholesalers posted a 0.5 percent gain to $192.2 billion. Retailers
registered a 0.8 percent advance to $236.5 billion.
   Manufacturing sales, meanwhile, declined 0.8 percent to $237.5
billion, while wholesalers posted a 1.0 percent drop to $152.0
billion. Retail sales totaled $150.0 billion.

<HEAD>Blood Sample Taken From Minister Suspected in Attack on Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have taken blood and saliva samples
from former minister Walker Railey and say they may seek to
prosecute him in the near-fatal choking attack on his wife three
years ago.
   Deputy Police Chief Ray Hawkins said Sunday he hopes to present
the case to the district attorney's office for reconsideration on
seeking a grand jury indictment later this month or early next
month.
   Police have long considered Railey, 43, their prime suspect but
have never persuaded the district attorney to charge him. Railey
was found liable in a civil trial, however.
   At the time of the attack, Railey was the senior pastor of the
First United Methodist Church of Dallas and a prominent liberal
minister whose Sunday sermons were televised.
   Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey, now 41, was choked with a cord in her
home on the night of April 21, 1987. She never regained
consciousness and remains in a nursing home in what doctors call a
persistent vegetative state with little chance of recovery.
   Although he has maintained his innocence, Railey has refused to
cooperate with authorities and fully answer questions about the
assault.
   Railey said he was away from the house at the time of the
attack.
   Hawkins' statement came only two days after a Dallas detective
and FBI agents picked Railey up in California, where he now lives,
and had him give blood and saliva samples. The authorities had
obtained a court order earlier Friday to obtain the samples from a
judge who then sealed all documents.
   ``It's fair to state that Dr. Railey was surprised,'' Hawkins
said.
   Hawkins refused to give details of the investigation. Friday's
action by federal agents was the first in the case in some time.
   In the weeks before the attack on his wife, Railey had reported
receiving several threatening typewritten letters to him at church.
The letters, which complained about Railey's sermons urging racial
tolerance, were traced later to a typewriter in his church.
   Authorities also have said that Railey failed to disclose a
visit and phone call on the night of the attack to Lucy Papillon, a
Dallas psychologist who later testified that the two were having an
affair.
   Ten days after Mrs. Railey was attacked, on the day that police
had planned to interview Railey extensively, he was found
unconscious after attempting suicide with a drug overdose.
   Within the year, he was hospitalized at a psychiatric hospital,
resigned his ministerial credentials, gave up custody of his two
young children, and moved with Ms. Papillon to California.
   In 1988, a Texas district judge found Railey liable for the
attack and ordered him to pay almost $18 million in damages. He has
paid nothing toward the civil judgment, saying he is barely making
enough to support himself.

<HEAD>Administration Nears Submitting Mexican-Trade Measure to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, spurred by events in
the Middle East, set forth an ambitious negotiating schedule Monday
aimed at completing a comprehensive free trade agreement with
oil-rich Mexico by the end of 1991.
   Administration officials said that President Bush would formally
submit to Congress within the next few days a request for authority
to negotiate an agreement dismantling barriers to the free flow of
goods and investment between the two nations.
   The administration's formal request starts a procedure in which
Congress has 60 legislative days, a period expected to last until
late spring, to review the proposal. If Congress gives its assent,
which is considered likely, then the administration can begin
negotiations with Mexico.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz told members of the
congressional Joint Economic Committee that if negotiations begin
in late spring, he hoped to have an agreement wrapped up by the end
of 1991.
   That timetable would be significantly faster than the 18 months
required to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Canada.
   Katz told reporters later that U.S. negotiators had learned a
great deal from the U.S.-Canada free trade talks and believed that
knowledge could be applied to speeding up a similar agreement with
Mexico.
   Administration officials have said that the Middle East crisis
has focused attention on America's trade relationship with Mexico,
which has the eighth largest reserve of oil in the world.
   The United States would like to work with Mexico in accelerating
oil production in Mexico, which currently stands at about 2.5
million barrels of crude daily.
   Katz and other administration officials suggested Monday that a
free trade agreement with Mexico would be a first step toward
achieving the president's goal of a hemisphere-wide free trade
zone, an achievement that Katz said could be reached before the end
of this decade.
   Members of the Joint Economic Committee were generally
supportive of the effort to remove trade barriers between the
United States and other countries in Latin America although Sen.
Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether the administration had
fully explored the impact on the U.S. economy.
   He questioned whether a free trade zone with Mexico would
encourage U.S. manufacturers to move their operations to that
country, where the costs of labor were lower.
   Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford said that while such an
agreement would have a big impact on the Mexican economy, any
effects on the U.S. economy would likely be small given the
relative size of the two economies. Mexico's total output is nly 4
percent of America's $5 trillion annual economy.
   Mulford said that the administration was anxious to complete an
agreement with Mexico to reward Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari for the free-market economic reforms he has instituted in
his country.
   Mexico is America's third largest trading partner, with two-way
trade totaling $51 billion last year.

   Veteran comedian Steve Allen doesn't find
anything funny about television's trend toward stronger language
and adult-oriented themes.
   Allen lashed out at current television trends in an opinion
piece published in Monday's Los Angeles Times.
   The ``flow is carrying us all along right into the sewer,'' he
wrote.
   ``The very sort of language parents forbid their children to use
is now being encouraged not only by anything-goes cable
entrepreneurs but the once high-minded networks,'' said Allen, host
of the 190s comedy-variety series ``The Steve Allen Show.''
   Shows that depict children and others using vulgar language only
point up the collapse of the American family, he said.
   Allen applauded NBC's censoring of some remarks by comedian
Andrew Dice Clay on a recent ``Saturday Night Live'' episode. He
called Clay ``the prince of filth.''
   ``The best humor, when it is not simply purely playful, says
something witty and wise about the issues it confronts,'' said
Allen.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Perennial Mr. Olympia Lee Haney could be a hero
to Weight Watchers dropouts everywhere.
   Haney, crowned Mr. Olympia on Saturday for the seventh
consecutive time, says the secret to his muscle-bound form is
eating - and eating - and eating some more.
   The key is eating the right food, said Haney, 30, who estimates
he gobbles up 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day, 65 to 70 percent of
them carbohydrates.
   ``But most people eat a high-fat diet, have bacon or sausage in
the morning, a burger for lunch, and before they know it, they have
had 5,000 calories and have a lot of body fat,'' he said.
   Haney's latest Mr. Olympia crown, which came with $70,000 in
prize money, eclipsed the record of six consecutive titles that he
shared with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. It also left the two tied
for the overall title with seven wins apiece.
   ``Anyone who can repeat two, three or four times is tough to
defeat and is very special,'' Haney said. ``They know their body,
their nutrition, their preparation. That's what made Arnold so
great. It's not that easy.''

   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) - American author Toni Morrison's novel
``Beloved,'' depicting the struggles faced by three generations of
black women, has won The Chianti Ruffino Antico Fattore
international literary prize.
   Award sponsors praised the novel for ``giving a voice to the
experience of suffering, survival and life of the black population
of America and in giving a voice to the feminine experience within
the black population.''
   Morrison, who accepted the award Sunday during ceremonies at
Florence's Palazzo Vecchio, described the book as ``the story of
the complex and intense love of a woman for her children.'' It is
set before, during and after the Civil War.
   Morrison, who was selected from among winners of other national
literary prizes, receives a cash award of $4,200.
   ``I can't think of another prize that I could win which combines
these extraordinary elements: being invited to come to Florence,
entering this incredible palace, being chosen from a field of
international writers, and finally, being part of the philanthropy
of a family supporting art, patronizing artists who are dependent
on such generosity,'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Michael Jackson didn't say if it would be the
one with the glove, but he promised Boy Scout officials he would do
all he could to follow their edict to extend a hand to others.
   The pop music superstar was presented the Michael Jackson Good
Scout Humanitarian Award at a banquet in Century City.
   ``On behalf of the millions of past, present and future Boy
Scouts, I will try to abide by your motto of being prepared and
always extending a hand to others,'' said Jackson.
   ``Michael Jackson is a good example of youth, helping us keep
kids off the streets by supporting scouting,'' said Ray Martin,
chairman of the Los Angeles Area Council Boy Scouts of America.
   ``He supports what the scouting programs are doing - giving kids
an alternative to street gangs,'' Martin said.
   Jackson was joined at Friday night's ceremony by celebrities
including Chuck Norris, Scott Baio, Telly Savalas, Fred Travalena,
Stephanie Mills and Michael Eisner,chairman of the Walt Disney Co.

   The 12 European Community nations
decided today to expel Iraqi military attaches and restrict the
mobility of other personnel to protest Iraqi raids last week of
three countries' diplomatic compounds in Kuwait.
   EC nations were also weighing a possible air blockade of Iraq to
enforce a U.N. trade embargo.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it was important to
obtain backing from the U.N. Security Council for such a move, as
was done for the naval blockade.
   A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
12 states adopted a statement saying they ``decided in common
accord to expel the military personnel at Iraqi embassies and limit
the freedom of movement of (Iraqi embassy) personnel within the
capitals.''
   Before the joint statement was adopted today, Britain and
Belgium had already joined Italy and France in implementing
diplomatic sanctions against Iraq.
   Britain expelled eight staff members from the Iraqi Embassy and
ordered the deportation of 23 other Iraqi citizens. Belgium
restricted the mobility of Iraq's diplomatic personnel in Brussels.
   Following the EC statement, the West German Foreign Ministry
announced that it is expelling the Iraqi military attache staff in
Bonn and restricting the movement of other Iraqi diplomatic
personnel.
   ``The federal government has ordered the expulsion of the
military attache staff of the Iraqi Embassy in Bonn. They have 48
hours in which to leave the Federal Republic (West Germany),'' a
statement from the Foreign Ministry said.
   The statement said other Iraqi Embassy personnel would be
limited in their movements in West Germany to Bonn and the city's
airport shared with Cologne.
   France and Italy expelled several Iraqi embassy employees over
the weekend for the violations of the diplomatic missions.
   Some Iraqi diplomatic missions in the member states do not have
military attaches, so these EC nations can only restrict the
movement of diplomatic personnel.
   ``This all arises because I feel, the government feels, that
we've got to act in solidarity with the French and the other
countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out
during the last few days,'' Hurd said.
   On Sunday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the
embassy incursions.
   The foreign ministers were also discussing economic aid for to
Turkey, Egypt and Jordan to compensate for loss of income suffered
because of the gulf crisis. The EC Commission proposed that the
foreign ministers approve $1.95 billion in economic aid to be
disbursed through the end of 1991.
   ``There is not full agreement that a decision on figures should
be taken today,'' the British official said.
   Some officials said the talks were delayed because France and
Britain wanted to take their military efforts in the Persian Gulf
into account when deciding on the overall EC contribution.
   EC foreign ministers first proposed sending about $2 billion to
the three states during an informal meeting 10 days ago.
   Italy, which holds the rotating EC presidency, has said it will
also propose setting up an EC panel to track the compliance with
the U.N. embargo against Iraq. The sanctions were imposed after the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   Supreme Court nominee David Souter said today
that he opposes a flat ban on the death penalty and that the
Constitution does not bar its use.
   It was Souter's 51st birthday and his third day of testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Asked if the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment
barred use of the death penalty, Souter replied, ``I think that
would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion.''
   He said he ``could not join'' any opinion that banned all
capital punishment.
   If confirmed, Souter's view would be in line with the current
majority of the high court. His response underscored his reputation
as a law-and-order judge.
   Souter explained his approach to a range of criminal law cases,
including one in which he supported police use of sobriety
checkpoints.
   During his tenure on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, it ruled
against the checkpoints as extending police action too far in
violation of people's rights. But Souter alone dissented.
   In his testimony today, Souter said the checkpoints differed
from other searches because driving a car is ``a highly dangerous
and regulated activity.'' He said if the checkpoints were properly
conducted, police were correct in using them to try to prevent
tragedy.
   The use of police sobriety checks was upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court earlier this year. The court, acting on a Michigan case,
ruled 6-3 that such checkpoints do not violate the Constitution.
   On another issue, Souter was quizzed about his tough prosecution
of anti-nuclear protesters when he was New Hampshire's attorney
general - and whether there was an appearance of impropriety
because the builder of the Seabrook nuclear plant was helping
defray the law enforcement costs.
   Souter said he wasn't aware of the donations at the time and had
not solicited them. But in retrospect he said he should have
insisted the money be returned.
   ``I think that would have been an appropriate position to take
and I wish I had taken it,'' he said.
   Today's hearing started with birthday greetings for the New
Hampshire judge, now 51.
   ``Happy Birthday. We didn't bake a cake, but perhaps we'll let
you go home after today,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
complimented Souter for his handling of the committee's questioning
so far.
   At the opening of the televised hearings last Thursday, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``the burden of proof rests with
those who support a nomination.''
   But the conduct of the hearings made clear the opposite was true
- the burden was on potential opponents to find some chink in
Souter's Yankee armor.
   In two days of sparring with the committee last week, Souter
skillfully ducked making specific responses on politically
difficult issues, especially abortion. On that one, he said he
hadn't made up his mind and had made no promises to anyone.
   Key committee members, including Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
said they planned to take another run at the privacy issue, which
is at the heart of the abortion debate, and at others to see if
there is a reason for opposing the nomination.
   Outside of the committee room, feminist groups on Friday
announced their opposition because Souter would not state he would
support abortion rights on the court. But so far no committee
members have committed themselves to voting against him.
   Kennedy said Friday he was troubled by some of Souter's
responses to questions, including one where the nominee offered
what sounded like a callous explanation.
   Kennedy asked about a statement attributed to Souter that said
it ``dilutes the votes of those people who can read'' if
illiterates are allowed to vote. Souter said the remark was ``kind
of a statement of math.''
   Souter's response stood out in part because the bookish bachelor
has taken great pains in the hearings to portray himself as
compassionate and aware of a broad range of human concerns.
   After it completes it hearings, the committee will make its
recommendation to the full Senate.
   Souter's supporters have expressed great confidence he will join
the court this fall.
   Souter himself has been cautious, however.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., a longtime friend of Souter's who is
playing host to him in Washington during the nomination process,
said the judge won't even let people discuss possible places to
live if he moves to the capital.
   ``Maybe he's superstitious,'' Rudman said.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa's astonishing mix of political
instinct and personal charisma turned the stout peasant's son into
a candidate for Poland's presidency.
   Walesa has known the moment: when to leap the shipyard fence and
take charge of the 1980 strike that made the Communists legalize
Solidarity; when to say Solidarity would take over the government
in August 1989, as even close aides shook their heads dubiously.
   If this is the time for him to become president - he announced
his candidacy Monday - it will be because of his uncanny ability to
grip Poles with his vision and persuade them to follow.
   Walesa was not born to political power. He is the product of an
impoverished farm in a remote north-central hamlet of Poland, and
his education came at a technical school.
   He has never learned to speak Polish smoothly or any other
language at all. He is unpredictable, and at times maddeningly
ambiguous. He has been photographed fishing in his underwear. His
suit collection was recently expanded by three but is still single
digit.
   In fact, there have been suggestions among Poles that Walesa,
46, is not learned or cultivated enough to be president.
   ``Criticism that I do not know how to talk with presidents?''
Walesa once scoffed. ``I have talked to them and they want to talk
with me.''
   When Walesa drifted to Gdansk and took a job at the Lenin
Shipyard in 1967, no one would imagined that a little more than two
decades later, one foreign leader after another would be making the
pilgrimage to the Baltic port to see him. NATO General Secretary
Manfred Woerner and former President Reagan came on Saturday alone.
   Walesa's anti-Communist activism can be traced to 1970 food
price riots in which police killed some of his fellow workers. He
translated his growing furor into unquestioned authenticity.
   He lost one job after another as his labor activism increased
and was outside the strikebound shipyard when he made the famous
leap that merged his destiny with Poland's future.
   In his subsequent 10 years as Solidarity's leader, he has
maneuvered through martial law, imprisonment, repression and,
finally, the Communist regime's overtures and its eventual
downfall.
   Along the way, there were eight children, a Nobel Peace Prize in
1983 and enormous prestige at home and abroad, his mustachioed face
on countless magazine covers, a noticeable paunch and graying hair
but no dimming of his twinkling eyes. And there was the
incalculable satisfaction of seeing Poland's revolution sweep the
East bloc.
   Yet the new Solidarity-led government Walesa organized included
no official role for himself. Pushing aside accusations he was a
jealous demagogue, Walesa started to foment against his former
allies now leading the country.
   Many inside and out of Poland did not want to believe his
message - that Solidarity's unified days were over and political
parties had to develop - but most have come to agree and elections
are imminent.
   Now Walesa must wait for democracy's decision on whether he will
add the presidency to his biography.

<TEXT>
   A new police crackdown on black
faction fighting amounts to a ``license to kill'' for security
forces, Africn National Congress leader Nelson Mandela said
Monday.
   President F.W. de Klerk said he would announce further measures
this week intended to halt street clashes in black townships near
Johannesburg that have killed almost 800 blacks since Aug. 12.
   Also Monday, police in Pretoria arrested a right-wing extremist
who claimed responsibility for bombing two offices of the governing
National Party. Boers State Party deputy leader Piet Rudolph had
been in hiding since a weapons theft at an air force base in April.
The party opposes efforts to end apartheid in South Africa.
   No major township violence was reported over the weekend or
Monday, police said.
   The new police measures, codenamed Operation Iron Fist, were
announced Saturday in response to calls for the government to halt
the township carnage.
   They include more police and soldiers in the townships;
roadblocks; searches for weapons; use of dye dropped from
helicopters to identify participants in clashes; equipping police
vehicles with mounted machine guns; isolating workers hostels and
squatter camps with razor wire; and a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said all the measures
except the curfew would be implemented this week.
   The government previously declared the Johannesburg-area
townships unrest areas and poured in additional police and soldiers
in a bid to halt the fighting. But the street clashes continued.
   De Klerk said in Pretoria that additional measures would be
announced later this week. He did not elaborate but said those
participating in the violence would be prosecuted.
   He also said the violence had shifted from attacks against the
white-led government to a power struggle among black factions.
   ``The violence we have now is violence ... of various black
political factions trying to get the upper hand within the black
society so that they can play a leading role in the negotiation
process,'' the president said.
   De Klerk has pledged to eliminate the apartheid system of racial
segregation and white dominance. He also has called for
negotiations on sharing power with the black majority.
   Mandela, on a one-day tour of four small towns near Cape Town,
said the new police measures would be ineffective. He was most
upset by the mounting of machine guns on armored patrol vehicles.
   Police Maj. Gen. Gerrit Erasmus said the machines guns were for
protection from attackers with assault rifles. Several policemen
have been killed recently in such attacks.
   ``From now on we can expect indiscriminate shootings whenever
there are demonstrations, no matter how peaceful,'' Mandela said.
``In my view, this is a license to kill.''
   The ANC leader said police only need tear gas and water cannons
to control demonstrations. Mandela also said he believes the
security forces have helped orchestrate the violence.
   In addition, he reiterated charges that a ``sinister task
force'' had participated in recent attacks on blacks intended to
destabilize the situation. Witnesses have reported seeing white men
with blackened faces participating in the attacks.
   The government has said it would investigate such charges.
   Mandela said the government's failure to halt the unrest could
upset planned negotiations on power sharing. But he added: ``To
abandon the talks now would be to play into the hands of this task
force.''
   ``But we will not stand by and see our people mowed down like
dogs,'' Mandela said, reiterating a threat to arm ANC supporters.
The ANC, however, is not believed to possess a large arsenal of
weapons.
   Most of the fighting has been between Zulus loyal to the
conservative Inkatha movement and Xhosas and other blacks who
support the ANC.
   The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black political movements,
both oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and plans for a future
South Africa.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites dominate politics and the
economy and the 30 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs.

   The Salvation Army gives its clients ``soup,
soap and salvation,'' but the federal government says that isn't
enough - they should get the minimum wage, too.
   For 110 years, the non-sectarian Christian group, based five
miles northwest here in Verona, has fed, sheltered and offered
spiritual counsel to the people it has taken in at its adult
rehabilitation centers.
   In exchange for room, board and up to about $20 a week in pocket
money, the beneficiaries, as the Salvation Army calls them, assist
in the organization's kitchens or unload the discarded furniture
and clothes the Army collects, said William J. Moss, the attorney
for the Salvation Army's national headquarters.
   One Salvation Army official in Newark who spoke on condition of
anonymity described the program as ``soup, soap and salvation in
the name of Jesus.''
   The federal government, however, sees the situation differently.
The U.S. Department of Labor claims the people to whom the
Salvation Army ministers are employees - exploited ones at that -
and should be entitled to a minimum wage under the Fair Labor
Standards Act, Moss said.
   The Salvation Army contends that payment of a wage could doom
the social service centers, which are kept financially afloat by a
network of thrift shops they run across the country.
   ``The Salvation Army is convinced that the beneficiaries are not
employees entitled to the benefits of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
for the same reason that volunteers and students and trainees are
not employees,'' Moss said Sunday. ``They are not there to exchange
their services for compensation. They are there for their own
benefit, to be rehabilitated.''
   According to the organization, the work assignments teach the
discipline of work to the emotionally and financially destitute and
prepare them to become productive members of society.
   Labor Department officials argue that other rehabilitation
organizations, such as Goodwill Industries Inc., do meet minimum
wage standards.
   The government's action stemmed from a complaint filed by a
Salvation Army client in Pittsburgh several years ago. On Sept. 7,
the department concluded that the clients of the Salvation Army -
which maintains more than 11,000 beds in 117 centers nationwide -
are entitled to protection under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Moss
said the organization was given 10 days to respond to the letter.
   On Friday, Salvation Army officials sent a letter to Samuel D.
Walker, acting administrator of the Labor Department's wage and
hour division, advising him they would not comply with the minimum
wage demand. The Army said it would do everything in its power to
defend against threatened enforcement.
   A department spokesman in Washington did not immediately return
a telephone call Monday for comment.

   Arab radicals meeting in Amman on Monday
cheered calls for suicide attacks against American forces and for
an Islamic uprising to topple Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``We have striking examples of heroes who turned their bodies
into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to flee in
darkness as happened to the American Marines in Beirut in 1983,''
said Ibrahim Al-Kharraz of the Libyan Peoples Congress.
   The three-day conference of Arab leftists, Islamic party members
and Palestinian guerrilla factions ended with an endorsement for a
peaceful, negotiated Arab settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But it also urged Arabs ``to strike against the American
interests everywhere and by all means at the same moment an
American attack is launched agaist Iraq.''
   The conference communique also said regular appeals would be
made to Arab troops in Saudi Arabia and some gulf states to rebel
against their leaders and reject American orders.
   Al-Kharraz drew rapturous applause by exhorting Arabs to swiftly
move against U.S. forces and Saudi oil pipelines. He urged them to
follow the example of Jaul Jamal, a Syrian gunboat commander who
died in 1956 when he deliberately rammed his vessel into a French
warship during fighting over the Suez Canal.
   He also hailed the suicide bombers who killed 241 U.S. Marines
in an attack on their Beirut barracks in 1983.
   ``We have to move swiftly and with all means against the
American military presence on the peninsula and in the gulf and
follow the examples of the Arab struggles in the '50s and the
'60s,'' Al-Kharraz said.
   The call for Mubarak's ouster came from Adnan Saududdin, a
member of the Jordanian Islamic Front and the fundamentalist Moslem
Brotherhood. He made an impassioned plea for an Islamic uprising to
``free Egypt from the shackles of the treasonous Camp David
accords.''
   The 150 delegates from 11 Arab countries officially represent
only their individual organizations, so the communique did not
necessarily reflect the positions of their governments.
   Jordan, for example, agreed to act as host for the conference
although King Hussein has called for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait
and allow the ousted emir to return. However, the king has resisted
Western pressure to publicly condemn Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Saddam has won support in the Arab world by insisting that any
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait must be tied to a similar Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories and a solution to the
Palestinian problem. The United States objects to linking the Iraqi
and Israeli issues.
   ``The Arab triumph had already started when an Arab leader said
`No' to America and slapped its face. We will slap the face of Bush
with the shoes of Iraqi soldiers,'' Saududdin told the conference.
   ``Being leftists, Communists, Baathist or Islamist is not
important. What is important is for us all to stand in the same
trench with Iraq against Israel, the United States and their
allies,'' Saududdin said.
   Groups from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Mauritania,
Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and the Palestine Liberation
Organization were invited to the conference. It was organized by
the Jordanian Arab National Democratic Alliance.

   Ronald Reagan, visiting the Soviet Union for the
first time since leaving the White House, on Monday cautioned the
15 fractious republics against letting their passion for
independence boil over.
   The former president, speaking to lawmakers in the Supreme
Soviet parliament, recalled the ``wrenching and terrible'' Civil
War fought by American states over their division of powers with
Washington.
   ``As you find a reformulation of the relationships in your union
you will find there is a period of uncertainty and tension,'' he
told the parliament's international committee.
   ``Differences can be resolved in ways that are fair to all, but
reason must prevail over passion if there is to be a climate
conducive to the settlement of disagreements.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to negotiate a new
treaty giving more autonomy to the Soviet Union's ethnically and
geographically diverse republics. But 13 of them have already have
declared some form of independence or sovereignty, in which their
laws would take precedence over national laws.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived in the Soviet Union in
Leningrad on Sunday, the start of a five-day visit proposed by
Gorbachev when they last met in San Francisco in June. The two men
greeted one another Monday with a warm embrace, and Gorbachev
praised Reagan's contribution toward better superpower relations.
   ``I'm sure you must have sense by now during your stay here in
this country that we and people in Soviet society hold you in
tremendous esteem and respect,'' Gorbachev said before talks in his
Kremlin office.
   The official Tass news agency said Gorbachev and Reagan had a
``substantial and sincere'' talk, discussing the Persian Gulf
crisis, the prospects for continued cooperation between the Soviet
Union and the United States, and the outlook for cutting strategic
nuclear weapons.
   Parliamentary committee chairman Alexander Dzasokhov said
Reagan's presidency began in 1981 ``with a vision of our country as
one that was covered with thunderclouds, a country that was the
source of trouble to the whole world.''
   By the time he left office in 1989, Reagan had formed a
``different and fair image,'' Dzasokhov told about 50 lawmakers.
   In his speech, Reagan marveled at the reforms that have swept
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union since his fourth presidential
summit with Gorbachev in Moscow in May 1988.
   ``These are yeasty times, times of ferment,'' he said. ``Freedom
can bring out passions between groups of people that may boil over.
When they do, cool and calm decisions are called for by leaders, so
as to lower temperatures all around.''
   Reagan said political changes might come easier than economic
changes as the Soviet Union struggles to replace its centrally
planned command economy with a market economy.
   ``There will be disappointment and discouragement at times,'' he
said. ``There will be trials and errors, but if you have the
courage to persist, you will create an economy within which all can
prosper.''
   Reagan also said mistrust between the Soviet Union and the
United States has given way to ``cautious friendship.''
   He predicted gradual arms reductions by both superpowers in the
next five years ``as we find new ways to work together on matters
where our goals are similar.''
   ``Together, our great size can be used in the service of all
humankind to persuade those whose passions have reached the danger
point to cool down again.''

<TEXT>
   Hoover-ball, a game invented to help
President Herbert Hoover stay in shape, is returning to the
nation's capital after a 57-year absence.
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., is sponsoring the first
Hoover-ball Capital Classic on Sept. 29. The tournament, staged by
the Hoover Presidential Library Association, will be held on
volleyball courts on The Mall in Washington.
   The game, likened by one participant to ``throwing a frozen
turkey over your garage,'' blends elements of tennis and
volleyball. It pits two three-player teams against each other as
they heave a 6-pound medicine ball over an 8-foot volleyball net.
   The game was devised in 1929 by Hoover's physician to help the
31st president stay in shape and was played daily on the lawn of
the White House while Hoover was in office.
   ``President Hoover was a Hoover-ball fanatic,'' said Tom Walsh,
the library association's executive director. ``He and a group of
other Washington VIPs - who were dubbed by The New York Times as
Hoover's `medicine ball cabinet' - played six mornings a week, rain
or shine, beginning at 7 a.m. He even played the morning of March
4, 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated.''
   The game was forgotten until revived in 1988 for a national
tournament at the Hoover library and museum in West Branch,
Hoover's birthplace. The 1990 tournament last month attracted 50
teams.
   ``We're expecting at least a dozen teams in Washington,'' Walsh
said.
   He said teams were being organized by Hatfield's staff and by
the staffs of Iowa's Sens. Tom Harkin and Charles Grassley and Rep.
Tom Tauke.

<HEAD>Hazardous Trash Stored in Boat Stalls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTHLAKE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hauler stored medical waste, human
tissue and dangerous solvents at a boat marina and near a grocery
store because he could not afford to dispose of the waste properly.
   Former ball-bearing salesman Richard Kirkham said it was easy to
become licensed to dispose of hazardous waste but more difficult to
find places to store the refuse.
   Kirkham's Hazardous Waste Management Inc. stored 95 barrels of
hazardous solvents, fuels and toxic chemicals at Scott's Marina No.
2 on Lake Grapevine, authorities said. They also found said they 75
drums of chemical solvents and several cartons filled with used
syringes, soiled dressings, surgical gloves and human tissue at
Kirkham's office and at a warehouse near a Fort Worth grocery
store.
   Kirkham was caught removing water-soaked cartons of medical
debris from shoreline boat stalls last November, after the lake
northeast of Fort Worth receded following a flood.
   Dallas Water Utilities officials shut down a water treatment
plant for two days last November before determining there was no
evidence of contamination from the wastes.
   The discovery triggered a three-state criminal investigation of
Kirkham's one-truck operation.
   Kirkham has been fined $260, while it has cost $125,000 so far
to clean up the boxes and barrels he stashed at the marina, the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Sunday.
   No evidence has been found that Kirkham's illegal inventory
polluted the environment, federal officials said.
   A simple registration form made Kirkham one of the state's 2,034
hazardous-waste transporters in 1986. His company went unwatched by
state and federal regulators.
   He wasn't affected by the stringent rules imposed on licensed
disposal sites that would have guaranteed that he had the money to
destroy what he collected. Instead, he started the firm with a
pickup and four weeks of training at Texas A&amp;M University.
   Kirkham said he never intended to run the business illegally.
But his struggling operation was derailed when the sand-hauling
truck he used to subsidize the fledgling waste-hauling business was
wrecked. He used the money paid by waste producers to repair the
sand truck instead of properly disposing of the waste.
   ``And the reason that we did it is that hope springs eternal in
the breast of man,'' Kirkham told the Star-Telegram. ``We kept
thinking things would get better.''
   Kirkham said that when he could no longer afford to pay disposal
fees, he forged records to convince his customers that their waste
was reaching its destination.
   In June, the Environmental Protection Agency notified 214 of
Kirkham's clients that they were potentially liable for his actions
and billed each of them the full cost of storing and disposing of
the waste found at the boat dock.
   Among those notified were Texas A&amp;M University, Parkland
Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers
and the First Baptist Church of Dallas.
   Officials with the U.S. attorney's office in Fort Worth
confirmed in July they are continuing a criminal investigation of
Kirkham and Waste Management that was started by the EPA in
January.
   The investigation has spread to Oklahoma and Louisiana, where
records at licensed disposal sites conflict with manifests Kirkham
supplied to customers showing waste had been delivered,
investigators told the Star-Telegram.

   President Bush offered assurances today that
the command structure in Saudi Arabia will work well and U.S.
forces won't ``stand around waiting for someone else'' to give the
order to fight.
   ``The command structure will function very, very smoothly,''
Bush told a news conference.
   The president also said he believes the American public is
``magnificently united'' behind the international effort to end
Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait. But he cautioned, ``I'm not
clear in my own mind on how long this kind of support holds up.''
   Bush was asked who would give the orders to U.S. forces to
shoot. The question apparently was in reference to directions
earlier this month to American fighter pilots to wait for a
go-ahead from Saudi commanders before firing at Iraqi jets.
   ``I have no hesitancy at all to say to the parents of the kids
over there ... should something happen that required combat, the
command structure will function very, very smoothly,'' Bush said.
   ``We're not going to have to stand around waiting for someone
else to decide if there is some provocation, either,'' he said.
   Bush also appeared to support extending the naval embargo to an
air blockade of Iraq.
   ``I would be prepared to work with anybody to tie that
additional knot in the sanctions,'' he said. The U.S. ambassador,
Thomas R. Pickering, said Sunday a resolution would be drafted to
impose an air embargo, a step the United Nations has never taken
against a nation. Pickering briefed Bush today.
   Bush said he wants to bring the 150,000-strong U.S. forces home
``as soon as possible,'' but he said he did not know when that
would be.
   ``What we are trying is this all-out, full-court international
press on the diplomatic side. I want to see that work,'' said Bush.
He said he is hearing varying assessments from world leaders on how
well the sanctions are working.
   What if the crisis erupts into war, with thousands of American
casualties?
   ``I don't know, but I am inclined to feel that we are off to a
very good start,'' Bush said at a news conference with regional
reporters.
   ``I'm old enough to remember a clear-cut case, different
circumstances, different times, World War II,'' he said. ``There
was a lot of sorrow, there was a lot of regret, everyone identified
with the families who lost loved ones. But the country stayed
fairly well together.
   ``Now, at this juncture I think the American people are
magnificently united in terms of standing up against this
aggression,'' Bush said.
   He declined comment on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's decision
to fire Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mike Dugan for his blunt
remarks identifying targets in a possible massive air strike
against Iraq.
   ``I'll have nothing to say about that except I strongly support
our secretary of defense,'' the president said.
   Cheney said he relieved Dugan of his office because he violated
Pentagon policy in discussing ``specific targets for air strikes,''
revealed classified information and demeaned the contribution of
other services.
   ``Relieving him is not a pleasant task, but I felt it was a
necessary one,'' Cheney told reporters at the White House.
   On other matters, Bush said:
   - He does not plan to draw down the strategic petroleum reserve
at this time, claiming ``I have not felt there is a shortage.'' But
he said a case could be made that tapping the reserve would help
stabilize gasoline prices.
   - The Mideast crisis should lay rest to talk about a ``peace
dividend'' in the defense budget. ``I've always thought that was a
phantom. How can you declare a dividend when you're operating at a
loss?'' he asked.
   - Iran has provided indirect assurances that it wants to see the
sanctions against Iraq work, despite deep differences that remain
between the U.S. and Iran. But ``some factions within Iran will
continue to resist improvement in relations with the United
States,'' he said about an ayatollah's call for a holy war.
   Bush said an air embargo against Baghdad would be hard to
enforce.
   Earlier, the White House said the hostile reaction in Baghdad to
Bush's televised appeal to the Iraqi people demonstrates how
effective his message was.
   Bush got his chance Sunday to make his case directly to the
Iraqi people, saying the only way for Iraq to avoid a war it cannot
win is to end its occupation of Kuwait.
   ``That decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein,'' Bush said
in a taped address broadcast over Iraqi television Sunday.
   Bush's eight-minute message was followed immediately by a
lengthy criticism by Saddam's spokesman, charging that Bush's words
were ``full of lies and contradictions.'' It set off demonstrations
in the streets of Baghdad, with Iraqis chanting ``Death to Bush!''
and ``Death to America!''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the angry response
shows that Bush's ``speech was very effective.''
   ``The most telling aspect was the lengthy and extraordinarily
personal attack against the president immediately following it,''
Fitzwater said, as well as ``the organized demonstrations.''
   ``They obviously felt it was necessary to try to discredit the
United States as much as possible,'' the White House spokesman
said.
   ``We think it's important to be able to get the word through to
the people of Iraq about the world''s unanimity against (Iraq) and
to be able to speak forthrightly about what the U.S. role is,''
said Fitzwater.
   ``We're glad they gave us the opportunity,'' he said.
   Dugan will no longer serve as the Air Force's top commander, but
he retains his rank as a four-star general, the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon's rare disciplinary action of a top officer came
one day after published reports quoted Dugan as saying U.S.
military authorities had concluded that massive air strikes are the
only effective way of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait if war erupted.
Dugan was on a tour of U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia
when he made his comments in an interview with The Los Angeles
Times and The Washington Post.
   Bush and the Cabinet also heard firsthand from Secretary of
State James A. Baker III about the $14 billion pledged by America's
allies for the gulf effort.
   Baker returned early Sunday from an 11-day mission to Europe and
the Middle East during which he solicited help for the costly stand
in the Saudi desert.
   ``Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle
between Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world,''
Bush said in his televised message to Iraqis.
   ``Iraq finds itself on the brink of war,'' Bush said.
   ``Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately,
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait,'' he said.
   ``War is not inevitable. It is still possible to bring this
crisis to a peaceful end,'' he said.

   Families held funerals Monday for
25 Honduran children and their American bus driver who drowned
while their vehicle was trying to cross a flooding river.
   Rescue crews searched for eight other people missing after the
accident Sunday. ``It is a national tragedy,'' said Nora de Melgar,
mayor of Tegucigalpa, where the bodies were brought to the morgue.
   One child and two adults were rescued from the bus, which was
sucked underwater as it was crossing the usually shallow Rio Grande
between the villages of El Naranjal and Cantarranas, about 80 miles
southeast of Tegucigalpa, authorities said.
   The bus was carrying children ranging in age from 10 months to
16 years on an outing for a missionary preschool, authorities said.
   The driver, Dorothy Landers Hood, 52, of East Petersburg, Pa.,
died in the accident. She and her husband, George B. Hood, had
operated the school in El Naranjal for more than 10 years.
   At least 40 people were on the bus when it was caught in the
flooding river, said a firefighters spokesman, Lt. Frank Medina.
Heavy rains had been falling during the day in the area.
   President Rafael Callejas appealed for authorities to help the
victims' families. Tegucigalpa authorities donated coffins for
burials in Cofradia and El Zarzal, near the victims' hometown of
Cantarranas.
   Funerals for several of the victims were held in a Protestant
church in Cofradia and in several private homes.
   More than 200 firefighters, police and Red Cross rescue workers,
with help from the army, searched the banks of the river near
Cantarranas on Sunday and Monday looking for survivors or bodies.

   Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union agreed Monday to
restore diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors after a break
of more than 50 years, the official Tass news agency reported.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met the Saudi foreign minister,
Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al Saud, and expressed the hope that
bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia would
help settle the Persian Gulf crisis, Tass reported.
   ``The restoration of diplomatic relations amid an acute crisis
in the Arab East emphasized the resolve of both states to
insistently seek the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions on the Persian Gulf in cooperation with other members
of the international community,'' Tass said.
   It said Gorbachev and Prince Saud ``assessed the possible
conduct of the aggressor'' - meaning Iraq - in their Kremlin
meeting. Prince Saud handed Gorbachev a message from King Fahd, the
Saudi monarch, the news agency added, without disclosing its
contents.
   Earlier, the prince met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, and they urged the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi
troops from Kuwait, Tass said.
   In their discussions of the Persian Gulf crisis, Saud and
Shevardnadze noted the similar positions of their nations and that
both sides wanted a peaceful settlement.
   ``We hope that faced with the world community's unanimity, Iraq
will agree to the immediate and unconditional withrdrawal of its
troops from Kuwait and will restore legality,'' Tass quoted Prince
Saud as saying.
   Saudi Arabia and Moscow had full diplomatic relations until
1938, when dictator Josef Stalin closed his embassy in Saudi Arabia
to save money. Several attempts to re-establish ties during the
1980s faltered over what Saudi Arabia called the Soviet Union's
``belligerent attitude'' toward its 50 million Moslems.
   A Soviet-Saudi communique said the two nations decided to
restore ties after indicating a ``desire to develop friendly
relations,'' according to Tass.
   ``The sides agreed that their bilateral relations will be built
in accordance with the U.N. Charter on the basis of principles of
peaceful coexistence, equality and mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in internal
affairs,'' the communique said.
   Tass did not give a timetable when the two nations would
exchange ambassadors, although it announced that the prince would
hold a news conference Tuesday.
   A full report on the prince's meetings with Gorbachev and
Shevardnadze also was carried on the evening news program
``Vremya.''
   Gorbachev asked Prince Saud to convey his best wishes to King
Faud and the Saudi people, Tass said. The Soviet leader expressed
hope that relations between the two nations would develop on a
large scale, Tass said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry official Sergei Kirpichenko has been
quoted as saying the establishment of official contacts between the
Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia ``has long been ripe.''
   On Sunday, Abdul-Wahab Abdul-Wasie, the Saudi Arabian Minister
of Pilgrimage and Endowments, arrived in Moscow to attend a
three-day Islamic conference and meet with Soviet Moslems, Tass
said. The visit is the first ever to be made by a religious affairs
minister to the Soviet Union.
   Before leaving Saudi Arabia, Abdul-Wasie said he was seeking to
consolidate cooperation between Soviet Moslems and religious
circles in Saudi Arabia.
   As part of the improving atmosphere between the two countries,
King Fahd recently donated about 1.6 million copies of the Moslem
holy book, the Koran, to Soviet Moslems. The Soviet Union allowed
more than 1,000 Soviet Moslems to make the annual pilgrimage, or
hajj, to Mecca this summer.

<HEAD>2 Bomb Blasts in Puerto Rico; Group Says One Was Gulf Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small pipe bombs exploded
simultaneously early Monday at a Citibank branch and a factory,
causing minor damage but no injuries, police said.
   A pro-independence group said it set the bomb at the Citibank to
protest a planned 1991 plebiscite on Puerto Rico's relationship
with the United States and the use of Puerto Rican soldiers in the
Persian Gulf crisis. Police said the bomb destroyed the front door
of the bank branch in Arecibo, 45 miles of San Juan.
   No group claimed responsibility for a blast at an electrical
switch factory in Vega Baja, about 20 miles west of the capital.
The pipe bomb had been placed in an air-conditioning unit and
caused minor damage.
   Both explosions took place at 1:05 a.m. but it was not
immediately known if they were related, said police spokesman Edwin
Burgos.
   The pro-independence group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces-Albizu Campos, claimed the Citibank bombing in a statement
to a San Juan radio station. The group, which carried out two
similar bombings last year, takes its name from independence leader
Albizu Campos, who died in 1965.
   Congress is considering legislation that would allow Puerto
Ricans to vote in a plebiscite in June 1991 on whether to remain a
U.S. commonwealth, become the 51st state, or form an independent
nation. Polls indicate less than 10 percent of the population
favors independence.
   The Caribbean island of 3.6 million people has been a
commonwealth since 1952. The status gives Puerto Ricans most rights
of U.S. citizenship, but they cannot vote for president. They pay
no federal taxes.

<HEAD>Initial Ratings for Emmy Telecast Lower than 1989</HEAD>

   Preliminary ratings for the 42nd Annual
Primetime Emmy Awards indicated the stolid ceremony was less
popular than 1989's awards show.
   Highlighted by the surprising shutout of ABC's spooky ``Twin
Peaks,'' the Fox Broadcasting Co. Emmy telecast finished behind
ABC's and CBS' programming Sunday night, according to viewer
figures released Monday.
   Fox spokesman Steve Ross said that in 24 television markets, the
Emmys finished first in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and
Phoenix. In other cities, the ceremony lost to such shows as ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' and CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Fox said the telecast generated overnight A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings of 11.5. Last year's broadcast had a rating of 15.4. Each
rating represent the percentage of television sets tuned to the
show.
   Final national ratings, which usually are lower than the
overnight figures, are to be released Tuesday.
   It wasn't a complete wash for the upstart Fox network. Its ``The
Simpsons'' was honored as best animated series and network star
Tracey Ullman won a combined six trophies, the most of any show.
   The broadcast, whose hosts were Jane Pauley, Jay Leno and
Candice Bergen, ran 14 minutes past its allotted three hours. There
were few surprises during the show, as veterans and favorites
captured most of the top prizes.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' the critically acclaimed ABC series from
director David Lynch, was blanked at Sunday's gala despite a
leading 14 nominations. The show collected two technical awards,
for editing and costuming, on Saturday.
   Lynch was not immediately available for comment. A publicist
said he was filming a new episode.
   ``L.A. Law'' won as best drama series for the third time in four
years and ``Murphy Brown'' was named best comedy.
   Peter Falk's rumpled but brilliant ``Columbo'' earned him the
dramatic actor award - his fourth Emmy for the role of the
trenchcoat-wearing detective he created during the '70s.
   Backstage, Falk said the occasional series and its title
character work for audiences because the story-telling isn't
sloppy.
   ``We don't cheat as much as some other shows,'' he said of the
show's mysteries. There are ``genuine twists'' in the dramas and
they are credible, said Falk, who turned 63 the day of the award
show.
   Best miniseries went to NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,''
an account of the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena and the subsequent cover-up by Mexican officials.
   The miniseries generated outrage in Mexico as a
misrepresentation of the current drug-fighting situation and led to
Mexico's creating a $950,000 advertising campaign in the United
States extolling Mexico's successes in fighting drugs.

   International pressure on Saddam Hussein intensified Monday as
European nations expelled Iraqi diplomats to retaliate for raids on
embassies in occupied Kuwait, and support appeared to grow for an
air embargo against Iraq.
   Oil prices jumped Monday, pointing to pessimism about prospects
for a settlement of the 6{-week-old Persian Gulf standoff. Oil
futures soared to record levels, above $33 a barrel, on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   In a sign of Iraq's growing isolation, the Soviet Union,
Baghdad's longtime patron, said Monday it would re-establish
diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis infuriated Iraq by
agreeing to become the main staging ground for the deployment of a
U.S.-led multinational force after the Aug. 2 Iraqi takeover of
Kuwait.
   Sensitivities about the role of the U.S. force were underscored
when a top U.S. military man was sacked after discussing
contingency plans to launch massive air strikes against Baghdad and
target Saddam personally.
   The fired official, Air Force chief of staff Gen. Mike Dugan,
made the remarks while touring U.S. military installations in Saudi
Arabia, and they were published Sunday in The Washington Post and
the Los Angeles Times.
   ``There are certain things we never talk about. We never discuss
operational matters, such as the selection of specific targets for
potential air strikes,'' an angry Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
told reporters in Washington. He dismissed Dugan after consulting
President Bush.
   Bush, meanwhile, said he considered Americans to be
``magnificently united'' behind the U.S. military effort in the
gulf, but he cautioned, ``I'm not clear in my own mind on how long
this kind of support holds up.''
   At a news conference Monday, the president said he wanted to
bring home the 150,000 U.S. troops in the region ``as soon as
possible'' but did not know when that would be.
   Arab radical groups, meanwhile, ended a three-day conference in
Amman, Jordan on Monday with calls for suicide attacks on the U.S.
forces.
   ``We have the striking examples of heroes who turned their
bodies into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to
flee in darkness,'' Libyan Ibrahim Al-Kharraz told delegates,
referring to the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that
killed 241 U.S. servicemen.
   In Iraq, there was an outburst of anti-American sentiment in the
state-run newspapers Monday, a day after Iraqi television broadcast
an eight-minute message from Bush to the Iraqi people. ``Shut Up,
Mr. Bush,'' one headline said.
   Bush's videotaped message, in which he warned that Saddam was
leading Iraq into war, was followed immediately by an Iraqi
commentary blasting the speech as ``full of lies and
contradictions.'' Hundreds of demonstrators then took to the
streets of Baghdad, chanting ``Death to Bush!'' and ``Death to
America!''
   The Bush administration said the hostile reaction demonstrated
the effectiveness of Bush's message. ``They obviously felt it was
necessary to try to discredit the United States as much as
possible,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   At the Kuwait-Saudi border, Iraqi troops unexpectedly opened the
only border crossing over the weekend, and about 6,000 Kuwaitis
fled their homeland. The flow slowed to a trickle Monday.
   Refugees said Iraqi troops were seizing draft-age Kuwaiti men
and forcing their wives and daughters to travel to Saudi Arabia
without them. U.S. officials expressed concern over Kuwaitis being
forced to leave their identity papers with Iraqi border guards.
   ``The confiscation of identity papers is an ominous sign that
these citizens of Kuwait may not be allowed to return to their
homes,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``If this
is part of an Iraqi effort to drive Kuwaitis from their homes, it
is unacceptable.''
   In Brussels, Belgium, the 12 European Community nations
announced they would expel Iraqi military attaches and their staffs
and restrict travel by other embassy personnel to protest break-ins
by Iraqi troops at diplomatic premises in occupied Kuwait last
week.
   The Iraqi raids on Dutch, French, Belgian and Canadian embassies
or diplomatic residences were unanimously condemned Sunday by the
U.N. Security Council.
   Britain said Monday it was deporting eight diplomats and 23
Iraqi nationals deemed a danger to national security, and West
Germany gave walking papers to the Iraqi military attache's staff.
Italy said Monday it was expelling 11 Iraqi Embassy employees who
worked in the military attache's office.
   The EC ministers were also weighing a possible air blockade of
Iraq to enforce the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq. British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there was strong support among
the EC ministers for such a blockade.
   The Belgian foreign affairs minister, Mark Eyskens, concurred.
   ``Everybody was arguing for an air blockade,'' he said.
   Hurd said, however, that it was important to obtain backing from
the U.N. Security Council for such a step. U.N. diplomats on Sunday
began drafting a new resolution to close Iraq's air routes and
punish nations flouting the embargo, U.S. officials said.
   An air blockade would involve the interception of planes
approaching Iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering
hostilities than the boarding of ships in the Persian Gulf.
   Hurd also renewed complaints about Iraq's treatment of diplomats
in Kuwait, where about a dozen nations, including the United
States, are defying Baghdad's orders to close their embassies.
   ``They are surrounded by soldiers, they can't get food or drink
in,'' Hurd said.
   In other developments:
   -Four French nationals - a married couple and two men - arrived
in Amman, Jordan on Monday after being freed from Iraq. They said
they were held in a site about an hour from Baghdad with about 10
other hostages, including an American. Iraq is using trapped
Westerners as human shields against attack on key Iraqi
installations.
   -Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said three Irishmen had
been jailed in Iraq on charges of attempting to escape the country.
Also, West Germany said Iraqi troops seized another West German in
Kuwait, raising to 44 the number of West Germans held by Baghdad.
   -An Egyptian military source said Egypt was sending 250 soldiers
to Saudi Arabia Monday and more would follow in a few days, joining
the estimated 4,000 Egyptian troops in the region.
   -A senior Iranian delegation met in Baghdad with an Iraqi team
to discuss normalization of ties between the two nations, which
fought a war from 1980 to 1988. Saddam last month initiated a
prisoner exchange, agreed to shared sovereignty over a key waterway
that forms the southern border between the two countries, and
removed troops from Iranian territory captured during the war. But
the Red Cross says the month-long prisoner exchange has stopped.
   -In Beijing, 42 Kuwaiti athletes and a coach arrived Monday to
take part in the Asian Games, which begin Saturday. Kuwait's
National Olympic Committee, now based in exile in Saudi Arabia,
said athletes who were out of the country during the Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion would participate.

crisis:

<TEXT>
   ---
   U.S. Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Mike Dugan, was fired for
his public comments about contingency plans to unleash massive air
raids on Iraq and target Saddam Hussein personally. The remarks,
made while touring military installations in Saudi Arabia, were
published Sunday in The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
   ``There are certain things we never talk about. We never discuss
operational matters, such as the selection of specific targets for
potential air strikes,'' an angry Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
told reporters in Washington.
   ---
   The 12 European Community nations decided to expel Iraqi
military attaches and restrict the mobility of other personnel to
protest Iraqi raids last week on three countries' diplomatic
compounds in Kuwait. EC nations were also weighing a possible air
blockade of Iraq to enforce a U.N. trade embargo.
   ---
   Arab radical groups ended a three-day conference in Amman,
Jordan with calls for suicide attacks against the U.S. forces.
Ibrahim Al-Kharraz, a member of the Libyan Peoples Congress,
pointed to the 1983 suicide attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut
that killed 241 U.S. servicemen.
   ---
   Britain said it would expel the Iraqi military attache and three
aides from the embassy in London. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
indicated the Home Office would soon be annoucing further sanctions
against Iraq.
   ---
   An Egyptian military source said Egypt will send 250 soldiers to
Saudi Arabia and more will follow in a few days, joining the
estimated 4,000 Egyptian troops already in the region. The source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Egypt would also send
Egytian tanks, armored personel carriers and air defense systems to
Saudi Arabia by ship across the Red Sea.
   ---
   Israeli Army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, says Israel
will not automatically respond in kind to an Iraqi invasion of
Jordan, signaling an easing of Israel's stand on the gulf crisis.
The comment, reported by Israeli newspapers, followed suggestions
that an Iraqi invasion of Jordan could be aimed at drawing Israel
into the gulf conflict as a way of uniting Arab nations behind
Iraq.
   ---
   In a sign of Iraq's growing isolation, the Soviet Union,
Baghdad's longtime patron, said it would re-establish diplomatic
ties with Saudi Arabia.
   ---
   Iraqi troops randomly seized young men among the thousands of
refugees fleeing Kuwait but let their sobbing wives, mothers and
other women go. Refugees said busloads of men between the ages of
17 and 40 were seen being shipped north, toward Iraq. No
explanation was given. Other young men were allowed to pass
through.
   ---
   Oil prices jumped, pointing to pessimism about prospects for a
settlement of the 6{-week-old Persian Gulf standoff. Oil futures
soared to record levels, above $33 a barrel, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>Denied Honor in Home Town, Former Hostage Salutes Townspeople</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though denied an honor from his
native city, former hostage Brian Keenan said Monday he was moved
by the welcome of ``my home, my town.''
   Keenan was honored at a reception arranged by Lord Mayor Fred
Cobain after a proposal to make him a ``freeman'' - an ancient
distinction for prominent residents or benefactors - became
entangled in Northern Ireland's political divisions.
   Despite the controversy that preceded him, Keenan told a news
conference that he had felt ``the capacity of the people of this
town to love, to love passionately.''
   ``Division, confrontation, even the immediate history of this
land, have not and cannot ever obliterate this love in all the
people.''
   In a province where Protestants generally support union with
Britain and Roman Catholics identify with Ireland, Keenan is an
unusual figure - a Protestant who carries passports of both
countries and advocates a united Ireland.
   Some Unionist members of the city council were offended by
Keenan's identification with Ireland and by the Irish government's
prominent efforts to secure his release after 4{ years as a hostage
in Lebanon.
   ``I don't see why we should stand on our heads to do special
events for him - let Dublin give him the freedom of that city,''
council member Frank Millar said following Keenan's release Aug.
25.
   Dr. Brian Feeney, a Catholic member of the Belfast council who
had suggested awarding the freedom of the city to Keenan, said the
Unionist opponents had ``made fools of themselves in front of the
rest of the world.''
   Council member Sammy Wilson, a member of the Rev. Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party, said he was staying away from the
reception and complained that the Irish government had ``milked the
affair dry.''
   ``Ordinary people are suffering from terrorism daily in Belfast
and I cannot forget that Sinn Fein representatives had been
involved in earlier attempts to free Brian Keenan,'' Wilson said.
   In December 1987, Sinn Fein spokesman Joe Austin said that he
and another party member had met with various groups in Beirut
seeking Keenan's release. Keenan's sister Elaine Spence said at the
time that the family did not know in advance of the Sinn Fein
overture, did not request help and had no connection with the
party, which is the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   Wilson's party finally decided not to boycott Monday's
reception, and Sinn Fein council members - who were not invited to
the event - also eased tensions by dropping plans to stage a
demonstration.
   Keenan returned to Belfast in time to celebrate his 40th
birthday on Tuesday at the home of his 69-year-old mother, Minnie.
   It also put Keenan within reach of his frequently expressed
desire - a hearty, home-cooked ``Ulster fry'' breakfast of eggs,
sausage, bacon and fried bread.

   Two moderate earthquakes struck the
Caribbean within minutes of each other Monday, the U.S. Geological
Survey said, but there were no reports on injuries or damage.
   The first earthquake at 9:05 a.m. EST measured 4.6 on the
Richter Scale and was centered in the Mona Passage, a 90-mile-long
channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, said the
U.S.G.S. in Golden, Colo. This tremor was felt over most parts of
Puerto Rico.
   It said a second quake at 9:24 a.m. EST was just north of the
island of Anguilla, a British territory 70 miles northwest of St.
Kitts and Nevis in the Leeward Islands. Its intensity on the
Richter scale was not immediately available, though it was
considered minor.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Lawsuit Against Contras in Aid Worker's Death</HEAD>

   A judge Monday dismisssed a $50 million damage suit
accusing the U.S.-backed Contras of torturing and executing
Benjamin Linder, an American volunteer killed during the Nicaraguan
civil war.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus said the case intruded too
far into the diplomatic arena.
   ``Political branches could be hampered in their ability to
conduct sensitive foreign policy initiatives with foreign groups
involved in civil war if the conduct later becomes subject to suits
by private citizens challenging the nature of war-making on foreign
soil,'' the judge wrote.
   Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., was shot to death in Nicaragua in
April 1987 when U.S.-backed rebels attacked the rural hydroelectric
project he was helping to build.
   A year later his family, with the backing of the New York-based
Center for Constitutional Rights, sued Miami-based Contra leaders
Enrique Bermudez, Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez.
   The Contra war against Nicaragua's leftist government formally
ended after free elections put President Violeta Chamorro in power
in February.
   Defense attorney John Kirkpatrick said Monday he was delighted
by the judge's ruling.
   ``This was a political lawsuit filed by a political group for
political reasons, and the judge understood that,'' Kirkpatrick
said.
   He said Center for Constitutional Rights had filed five lawsuits
against the U.S.-backed Contra effort, and all five had been
dismissed.
   The Linders' lawyer, Michael Ratner, said he was disappointed.
   ``I think the execution and torture of an American citizen is
something that should be seen as a violation of international
law,'' he said. ``I am sure we will appeal, and eventually we will
win.''
   Benjamin's father, David Linder, has accused the Contras of
torturing and killing his son to intimidate other foreign
volunteers who were aiding the Sandinistas. The suit said the
decision was made by the Miami-based Contra leadership.
   The Linders said an independent autopsy showed their son was
stuck with needles in his face before he was finally shot to death.
   The Contras said Linder was in a Sandinista uniform at the time
of his death and carried a weapon. They called him a casualty of
war.

<HEAD>Report Calls for Streamlining Federal Meat Inspections</HEAD>

   A controversial proposal to streamline beef
inspections should be adopted by the Agriculture Department,
including a feature putting greater reliance on packing companies,
the National Academy of Sciences said Monday.
   But a report from the academy said that the department, if it
relies more heavily on private industry to maintain meat quality,
should ``concentrate its resources on safety'' to guard consumers
against microbial and chemical contamination.
   ``The federal government should design its inspection programs
to focus on contemporary health issues,'' the report said. ``It
should insist that industry comply with policies and procedures
required to protect public health and foster public confidence in
the safety of the food supply.''
   For example, although supporting the speeded-up inspection
system for cattle, the report said the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, or FSIS, should develop methods for quickly
testing carcasses for microbial and chemical contamination.
   The Streamlined Inspection Service for cattle slaughter, or
SIS-C, was studied by a panel of the academy's Institute of
Medicine under a $154,000 grant from the department.
   ``From a food safety viewpoint, SIS-C alone is probably no
better, and in some situations can be less effective, than
traditional inspection because the reduced oversight by government
inspectors is not compensated by a total commitment to product
quality on the part of the industry,'' the report said.
   But the report also called the streamlined system ``the most
important change in bovine meat inspection'' since federal
supervision was begun in 1906.
   ``For this system to work in practice, both FSIS and industry
must fully endorse the philosophy of shifting responsibility for
meat quality from FSIS to industry so that the government can
concentrate on safety,'' the report said.
   The plan was officially proposed in November 1988. USDA
spokesman Jim Greene said an amended proposal would probably be
made based on the new study.
   Greene said the department plans to begin using the revised
system within two years, but only in plants that slaughter ``fed''
cattle for the slaughter market. These cattle are mostly
grain-fattened steers and heifers from feedlots.
   The report said about 80 of the nation's more than 1,300
USDA-inspected cattle slaughter plants would be eligible to use the
system. Those account for an estimated 80 percent of the fed cattle
slaughtered for the consumer market.
   Lester M. Crawford, FSIS administrator, said the 11-month study
by the scientific panel ``confirms our ongoing commitment to
modernize inspection at cattle slaughter plants is on solid
footing.''
   Under traditional inspections, federal inspectors check bile
ducts, heart, cheek muscles and numerous lymph nodes for disease
and other abnormalities. They also are responsible for condemnation
and disposition of diseased carcasses, as well as supervising the
trimming undesirable parts.
   But under SIS-C, plant employees would incise heart and cheek
muscles, position parts for inspectors and assume responsibility
for some trimming.
   Inspectors still would be responsible for condemnation and
disposition of diseased carcasses, and still would examine every
head, viscera and carcass.
   The streamlined inspection system is currently used
experimentally in five meat plants using high-speed techniques to
slaughter steers and heifers for the beef market.
   Agency officials said those include two Montfort plants, in
Greeley, Colo., and Grand Island, Neb.; two Excel plants, in Friona
and Plainview, Texas; and a National Beef plant in Liberal, Kan.
   The industry's American Meat Institute called the report ``an
objective assessment'' of the new inspection program and that it
may help to end the controversy over the merits of SIS-C.
   Tom Devine of the consumer-oriented Government Accountability
Project, which has helped federal whistleblowers to criticize USDA
inspection operations, said he was ``delighted'' by the report.
   ``It's a gratifying vindication for the concerns raised by
whistleblowers'' who as USDA inspectors alleged there have been
many slipshod, unsanitary practices in plants where the new system
has been used, he said.

   The jailed college freshman who is the
most publicized suspect in the serial killings of five college
students is confused about why he's jailed and is being treated
inhumanely, his grandmother says.
   ``I know he's getting very upset and he doesn't know why,'' Elna
Hlavaty said of her grandson, Edward Lewis Humphrey, in an
interview published Monday.
   ``They're treating him like he's ready for the gallows and he
hasn't even been charged,'' said Ms. Hlavaty, who visited him last
weekend in the Brevard County Jail, more than 100 miles from
Gainesville.
   Also Monday, a 17-year-old Montana girl was quoted as saying she
spurned Humphrey's marriage proposals about a month before the
slayings.
   Meanwhile, life has been returning to normal in this bustling
college town. Police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie Darnell on Monday
canceled daily news briefings, saying no major breaks were
imminent.
   The city's chamber of commerce dedicated this week to paying
tribute to the slain students, asking residents to display white
ribbons on mailboxes, fly flags at half-staff and attend a
tree-planting ceremony Friday.
   Humphrey, an 18-year-old University of Florida freshman, has
been identified as one of eight suspects in the stabbing deaths of
the five students, three of whom were mutilated. He's been held in
lieu of $1 million bond for nearly three weeks on unrelated
charges, including one that he beat his 79-year-old grandmother on
Aug. 30, two days after the last of the bodies were found.
   Humphrey is being kept in a medical isolation cell with only a
mattress and a blanket and is reportedly given daily doses of
Lithium to control his manic depression. His grandmother says
that's not fair.
   ``He's afraid and I'm afraid,'' Ms. Hlavaty told The Gainesville
Sun. ``They have no evidence against him in those murders, yet they
make no effort to be humane or decent to him.''
   She said one of his legs, injured in a car accident and
scheduled for surgery in December, has given him much pain because
he can sit only on the floor of his cell.
   Ms. Hlavaty, who denies Humphrey beat her and says she was
injured in a fall, said he was pressured into making wild
statements after hours of grueling interrogation.
   Published reports have said he gave investigators specific
information about crime scenes and attributed two deaths to
``John.'' Authorities say ``John'' is one of several personalities
Humphrey has displayed in jail.
   ``If someone bullied you for hours and hours and abused you
while you were wearing handcuffs, you wouldn't be able to take it
anymore,'' Ms. Hlavaty said. ``You wouldn't know if uou were John,
Sue or Jane. My grandson is a victim and he's vulnerable because of
his mental illness.''
   Brevard County Public Defender J.R. Russo played down a report
that investigators had found bloodstained gloves in the Indialantic
home where Humphrey lived with his grandmother and mother.
   ``It could have been from a fishing trip or anything else,''
Russo said.
   Ms. Hlavaty said the gloves belong to her and that they were
stained with her blood when she fell and cut her head.
   In Montana, a high school senior named Rachel, who asked that
her last name be withheld, told the Tampa Tribune she met Humphrey
in 1985 while he was visiting an aunt and uncle.
   She said she didn't see him again until July 18 when he traveled
more than 1,000 miles to Hamilton, Mont., to propose to her, the
Tribune reported Monday.
   ``He really became possessed with the idea of marrying me,'' she
said.
   The girl's mother, who spoke on condition that her name not be
used, told The Associated Press the teen-ager locked herself in her
room and cried last week when reports of her friendship with
Humphrey surfaced.
   ``She's upset at the implication that something she did may have
led to these deaths,'' she said.

<HEAD>Kemp Won't Answer Rinfret Charge He's Cuomo `Lackey,' Spokeswoman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp responded to an
angry blast from New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret by saying Monday that it might not be possible to attend a
Rinfret fund-raiser.
   Kemp is a ``lackey'' for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo because the Cabinet
secretary pulled out of hosting a fund-raiser, Rinfret complained
late Friday night in a call to The Associated Press. Rinfret had
announced earlier that Kemp had agreed to host an event.
   ``He has lied about me. He has misrepresented me. He has broken
his word to me and while he promised us support, he pulled the rug
out from under us,'' Rinfret said of Kemp.
   Rinfret called Kemp ``a traitor to the Republican Party, ... a
lackey for Governor Cuomo, and a man who is carrying on a personal
vendetta on behalf of the Conservative Party.''
   Rinfret's aides have invited Kemp to appear and ``no decision
has been made at this point,'' said Kemp spokeswoman Mary Brunette.
   ``He's got dozens of requests from candidates and already has
about 60 events on his schedule between now and the election so I
don't know if it will be possible to schedule something or not,''
she said.
   One of those events was an appearance Monday night in Lloyd
Harbor, N.Y., on behalf of GOP candidates for the New York State
Senate.
   Kemp had no public reaction to Rinfret's complaint that he is
Cuomo's ``lackey,'' according to Brunette.
   Kemp, a former Buffalo Bills quarterback and ex-congressman from
the Buffalo suburbs, was among a host of prominent Republicans who
declined to challenge Cuomo. Cuomo, a Democrat, is running for a
third term.

<TEXT>
   State Senate Minority Leader Robert Preston
asked for a recount Monday in New Hampshire's Democratic
gubernatorial primary.
   Former party chairman Joe Grandmaison came out of Tuesday's
primary 1,134 votes ahead, but two addition mistakes in Preston's
favor and one benefiting Grandmaison cut the lead by Friday to 593
votes.
   Preston said he was asking the secretary of state's office for a
recount ``without rancor or bitterness.'' Grandmaison said the
likelihood of change is ``remote.''
   The winner faces Republican Gov. Judd Gregg.
   Preston said he would pay for the recount and asked that it be
done as quickly as possible ``because I don't want to take away
from the campaign.'' Preston said he will not campaign while the
recount is being made.
   Gregg and Grandmaison are to square off Wednesday morning at a

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Mickelson said a videotaped
discussion he had with Brookings High School seniors will not be
used in political advertising because of objections from students
and teachers.
   Mickelson spoke to about 100 seniors in his hometown last
Wednesday at the invitation of Principal Don Kolsrud. Parts of his
speech were professionally videotaped, along with a
question-and-answer session that followed.
   Superintendent Stephen Doerr said the school administration knew
Mickelson was filming the session for television, but thought the
discussion took a back stage to the filming.
   ``I think there were times when the producer more so than the
governor made it a commercial venture,'' Doerr said.
   Democratic governor candidate Bob Samuelson said the governor
shouldn't have tried to film a commercial during school hours,
regardless if students knew he was taping a political
advertisement.
   The governor said he and his campaign staff explained their
plans ahead of time to the school administration and school board,
and that students were told over the intercom that he would be
filming his conversation with them.

<HEAD>Gubernatorial Candidate's Appearance Canceled After Liquor Raid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze
Jr. abruptly canceled an appearance at a picnic after learning it
had been raided by state liquor agents.
   Aides said the Democratic candidate for governor was stumping on
Sunday toward a picnic at the Strossmayer Croation Center when he
got word of a raid staged by Akron agents of the state Liquor
Control Board.
   Celebrezze spokeswoman Natalie Wymer said the candidate learned
about the problem from his advance staff just before the time for
his appearance.
   ``He obviously did not think it was appropriate for him to
attend an event that hadn't gotten a permit,'' Ms. Wymer said.
   The agents went undercover into the center, where liquor was
being sold without a license, and announced they were breaking up
the party. About 50 people were there, said Liquor Control Board
spokeswoman Patty Haskins.
   Two people were charged and agents confiscated 50 cases of beer,
100 loose cans of beer and 10 bottles of liquor, Ms. Haskins said.
She said the club had no license to sell alcohol, and the LCB had
received tips that sales were taking place.
   One of those charged, 72-year-old Joseph Tisler of Campbell,
said he believed the raid came about because of Celebrezze's visit.
Tisler said the club has existed for 30 years.
   Charged with Tisler, 72, of Campbell, was his daughter Ann L.
Korhan, 33, of Austintown.
   They are to be arraigned Sept. 27 in Girard Municipal Court.

   Entertainer Frank Sinatra couldn't believe
what he was reading: the ``reluctant pop star'' George Michael was
withdrawing from public view to reduce the strain of his celebrity
status.
   ``Come on, George. Loosen up. Swing, man,'' Sinatra wrote in a
letter to the Los Angeles Times, which was published one week after
the newspaper's Calendar magazine cover story featuring a
complaining Michael.
   ``Here's a kid who `wanted to be a pop star since I was about 7
years old.' And now that he's a smash performer and songwriter at
27, he wants to quit doing what tons of gifted youngsters all over
the world would shoot Grandma for - just one crack at what he's
complaining about,'' said Sinatra, who will be 75 on Dec. 12.
   In an interview, Michael said he was releasing his new CBS album
without promotional videos or a concert tour. He was also granting
only a few print interviews and planned to keep out of public view.
   A receptionist at CBS Records said Monday afternoon that no one
was available to comment on the Sinatra letter.
   Sinatra, who said Michael ``should thank the good Lord every
morning when he wakes up to have all that he has,'' continued with
sage advice.
   ``Dust off those gossamer wings and fly yourself to the moon of
your choice and be grateful to carry the baggage we've all had to
carry since those lean nights of sleeping on buses and helping the
driver unload the instruments.
   ``And no more of that talk about `the tragedy of fame.' The
tragedy of fame is when no one shows up and you're singing to the
cleaning lady in some empty joint that hasn't seen a paying
customer since Saint Swithin's day. And you're nowhere near that;
you're top dog on the top rung of a tall ladder called Stardom,
which in Latin means thanks-o-the-fans who were there when it was
lonely.
   ``Talent must not be wasted. Those who have it - and you
obviously do or Calendar's cover article would have been about Rudy
Vallee - those who have talent must hug it, embrace it, nurture it
and share it lest it be taken away from you as fast as it was
loaned to you.
   ``Trust me. I've been there.''
   It was signed: Frank Sinatra.

   After a 10-day sail across the ocean, the system
that once was Hurricane Isidore reached the cold waters of the
north Atlantic and lost its tropical characteristics, forecasters
said Monday.
   Isidore, which formed Sept. 7, was downgraded from a hurricane
early Sunday. It continued to weaken Monday and was expected to be
absorbed by a north Atlantic storm by Tuesday, said forecasters at
the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Isidore remained no threat to land, hurricane specialist Miles
Lawrence said.
   At noon EDT, Isidore's center was near 51.5 degrees north
latitude and 37.0 west longitude, or about 625 miles southeast of
the southern tip of Greenland.
   The system was heading northeast at 25 to 30 mph with winds of
45 mph.
   Isidore was the ninth named storm of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane
season, which ends Nov. 30. Weather systems are named after when
their sustained winds reach 39 mph.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top winds reach 74
mph.

   A shaken Mayor Xavier Suarez recounted Monday how
robbers held guns to the heads of his wife and mother-in-law, but
downplayed his role in frightening the men off with a gun of his
own.
   Police searched Monday for the two men who accosted the women
just outside the mayor's home Sunday night and forced them inside
while Suarez and his children were upstairs, said police spokesman
David Rivero.
   ``My kids and I ... very quickly converged in the upstairs room,
and we basically hid until I was able to come out and do my best to
convince (the robbers) to leave,'' Suarez said.
   He said he yelled down the staircase at the men and pointed his
gun.
   ``I was ready to use it,'' Suarez added.
   The two men escaped with the women's purses, some jewelry and a
portable telephone, police said.
   The mayor, who at one point choked up with emotion while
discussing the robbery, said his wife, Rita Suarez, was ``deeply
affected'' and one of his four children would need counseling. He
did not name the child.
   Mrs. Suarez and her mother, Olga Suarez, had just escorted
relatives to their car outside the family's private home south of
downtown at about 10:45 p.m. when the robbers ordered them inside,
said another police spokesman, Robert Navarro.
   The robbers' yelling alerted Suarez and his children, who were
upstairs.
   While Suarez was loading his weapon, he ordered his 12-year-old
son, Francis, to call for help on the ``blue phone,'' a direct line
to the police department, Navarro said.
   Officers arrived in minutes and surrounded the two-story pink
stucco home, but the gunmen got away.
   Police didn't say what kind of guns the robbers had, and Suarez
didn't describe his weapon.
   The incident wasn't the first crime at the home where Suarez and
his family have lived since 1985.
   The house was burglarized last year while the family was on
vacation. In 1987, a car containing a gun registered to the mayor
was stolen from the driveway.
   The mayor has police protection only occasionally, and the home
wasn't guarded by any officer when the gunmen arrived, said
Suarez's chief of staff, Odalys Mon.
   Beginning Monday an officer would be at the house all the time,
police said.

   The State Department responded to Philippine
President Corazon Aquino's announcement Monday that she wants an
orderly withdrawal of U.S. bases from her country by saying the
United States wants to stay.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher declined to discuss
the U.S. position in bases talks or to even confirm that the
negotiations are opening on Tuesday in Manila.
   But Boucher repeated that the United States wants to retain its
military presence in the Philippines, which includes two of
America's largest foreign bases: Clark Air Base and Subic Naval
Base.
   ``We hope that any new agreement will include provisions for a
continuing defense relationship, including U.S. access to
Philippine military facilities,'' Boucher said.
   He said the talks would ``define a new relationship with the
Philippines that includes a security dimension.''
   Asked if he had any specific response to Mrs. Aquino's
statement, Boucher said, ``I'm afraid that's my comment on Cory
Aquino's speech as well.''
   U.S. officials have repeatedly said that they will give up the
bases if the Philippines decides it doesn't want them. Alternative
sites for various installations have been explored throughout the
region.
   Under the current agreement, which expires in one year, the U.S.
military has unlimited access to Clark, Subic and four smaller
facilities, making them de facto U.S. bases although they
technically belong to the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a nationally televised speech, said the bases
talks would redefine U.S.-Philippine relations and added that her
government would work with the United States ``for arrangements
regarding the orderly withdrawal of their forces from our
country.''
   More than 40,000 American troops, Defense Department civilians
and military dependents now live in the Philippines. U.S. officials
tally the economic benefits to the Philippines in hundreds of
millions of dollars a year and thousands of jobs.
   Congressman Stephen Solarz of New York said last week, after
meeting with U.S. negotiating team leader Richard Armitage, that he
expects the U.S. side to propose a 10-year phase out of the bases.
Solarz, a Democrat, heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Boucher declined both last week and on Monday to discuss any
position the U.S. negotiators might take in Manila.

   Thousands of teachers struck New Orleans
public schools Monday in a contract dispute over working conditions
and $400,000 worth of health benefits - the city's first teachers'
strike since 1978.
   ``We're not striking just for money. . . . We're looking for
professional respect,'' said sixth-grade teacher Katy Hall, one of
a half-dozen teachers picketing Lafayette Elementary School before
dawn. ``I think the public looks upon us only as professional baby
sitters.''
   ``Maybe one in 10 toilets work. There's no toilet paper. No
teaching supplies. No ditto paper. There's always a shortage of
textbooks,'' said Joseph ``Wally'' Johnson, who teaches computer
science at Lafayette.
   Frank Fudesco, the board's chief negotiator, denied that there
was any shortage of toilet tissue.
   Union and school board officials said they did not know how many
of the 84,000 students were in class or how many of the 5,000
teachers crossed picket lines. Principals who were called for spot
checks said 75 to 90 percent of their students were in.
   Parents of some emotionally disturbed or educationally disabled
children were told that classes for their children were canceled.
Otherwise, the school board said classes would continue as usual.
   No contract talks were scheduled.
   Also starting strikes Monday were two districts in Pennsylvania:
Cumberland Valley in Cumberland County, with 6,457 students at 10
schools and 425 teachers, and Penn-Delco in Delaware County, with
3,000 students at six schools and 187 teachers.
   New Orleans union president Nat Lacour said the Orleans Parish
School Board's refusal to pay $400,000 in health insurance premiums
triggered the strike.
   The teachers scaled back their request over the weekend to $1
million in additional health benefits. The school board turned them
down and stuck to the $600,000 it had offered.
   ``We cannot give what we do not have,'' said Fudesco.
   Sharon Delahoussaye, picket captain at Lusher Elementary, said
premiums went up from $500 to $800 a person this year. The union
wants the board to cover half the $300 difference, she said.
   ``The board's first proposal was for $50 a person. The second
was for $100. We're asking $150 a person,'' said Delahoussaye.
   Lacour reinstated demands, dropped during earlier bargaining,
for a $45 million package that includes 10 percent annual pay
raises for the teachers plus 1,100 teachers' aides and school
secretaries.
   Louisiana teachers get much of their pay from the state, which
increased its share 7 percent this year. The state now pays $14,472
for a starting teacher with a bachelors degree and $25,737 for
someone with a doctorate and 25 years experience, said W.J.
Cleveland, of the fiscal office for the state Education Department.
   Some poor rural poarishes don't add anything to that. Cleveland
estimated that the average parish supplement is $3,500.
   New Orleans adds $4,983 to a starting salary and $9,374 at the
top of the scale, so that starting teachers get $19,455 and someone
at top gets $35,111.
   The city is offering no raise.
   The board has raised teachers' salaries twice since 1983, but
Lacour said the increases have been eroded by rising health
insurance and retirement costs.

<HEAD>Bush Supports Air Blockade, Mulls Length of Americans' Patience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday endorsed expanding
the Iraqi trade embargo to include air traffic as a way of
increasing pressure on Saddam Hussein. He expressed concern ove
whether Americans will stand united if the showdown drags on too
long.
   ``I'm not clear in my own mind at how long this kind of support
holds up,'' Bush said.
   Still, he said the country is ``magnificently united'' at this
point and recalled that the nation ``stayed fairly well together''
during World War II.
   Bush, at a news conference, also said that in retrospect he
regrets the U.S. policy of patient diplomacy toward Iraq before it
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. At the time, the administration was
resisting congressional attempts to impose sanctions against Iraq.
   ``If everybody had the benefit of total hindsight, why, you'd go
back and say, `This doesn't make much sense,''' Bush said of the
policy he pursued. ``I'm not sure, having said that, that that
would have changed Saddam Hussein's intention to take over
Kuwait.''
   Bush met with regional reporters after the firing of Gen. Mike
Dugan by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as Air Force chief of staff
for discussing contingency plans for the bombing of Iraq and the
targeting of Saddam personally. Bush endorsed the firing but
refused to comment on the subject further.
   The president offered clear support for stiffening the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq by imposing an embargo on air traffic, in
addition to the existing naval blockade. If approved, it would be
the first time the U.N. had ever authorized an air blockade.
   ``What we want to do is tighten up the United Nations sanctions
so nothing is going in,'' Bush said. ``And that's hard to do in
terms of overflights, and some countries that seem to be more
willing than others to avoid the sanctions.''
   Nevertheless, he said, ``I would be prepared to work with
anybody to tie that additional knot in the sanctions.''
   Bush offered no predictions about how long American troops will
be stationed in the Persian Gulf. More than 150,000 U.S. forces
already have been deployed and the buildup shows no sign of ending.
   ``I want those soldiers out as soon as possible,'' he said. ``I
want them all out - all out, period. And yet, I can't say when that
will be.''
   On Sunday, a taped address from Bush was broadcast in Iraq,
warning the Iraqi people they were ``on the brink of war'' because
of the invasion of Kuwait. Bush said the effort was worthwhile,
even if only two Iraqis heard it.
   If nothing else, Bush said laughingly, ``It got a good exercise
for the demonstrators who had been notified to demonstrate (against
the United States) before they even heard what I had to say, so it
kept them hustling around, jumping up and down, screaming about the
United States.''
   Bush was asked who would give the orders to U.S. forces to shoot
if fighting breaks out. The question apparently was in reference to
directions earlier this month to American fighter pilots to wait
for a go-ahead from Saudi commanders before firing at Iraqi jets.
   ``I have no hesitancy at all to say to the parents of the kids
over there ... should something happen that required combat, the
command structure will function very, very smoothly,'' Bush said.
   ``We're not going to have to stand around waiting for someone
else to decide if there is some provocation, either,'' he said.
   Asked how the nation would react to thousands of American
casualties, Bush replied, ``I don't know, but I am inclined to feel
that we are off to a very good start,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm old enough to remember a clearcut case, different
circumstances, different times, World War II,'' he said. ``There
was a lot of sorrow, there was a lot of regret, everyone identified
with the families who lost loved ones. But the country stayed
fairly well together.''
   Bush defended his decision not to tap into the huge strategic
petroleum reserve for fuel to offset any shortages due to the
embargo and help keep gas prices low. ``It is my judgment that
there isn't such a shortage at this time,'' the president said. He
said gas prices were being driven not by shortages but by
speculation about what will happen.
   The president said the Persian Gulf crisis has not prompted him
to reconsider his decision to ban new offshore oil drilling in
California. However, he said he was determined ``to more vigorously
go forward with incentives for domestic drilling'' - including in
Alaska.
   ``The bottom line,'' he said: ``It's going to have to be
conservation; it's going to have to be alternative sources; it's
going to have to be more hydrocarbon drilling.''
   He said the Mideast crisis should lay rest to talk about a
``peace dividend'' in the defense budget. ``I've always thought
that was a phantom. How can you declare a dividend when you're
operating at a loss?'' he asked.
   He also said Iran has provided indirect assurances that it wants
to see the sanctions against Iraq work, despite deep differences
that remain between the U.S. and Iran. ``I'm not going to buy into
the argument that they've (Iran) made some secret deal to violate
the sanctions,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>US, Soviets Seek Role in Promoting Angola Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union offered
to send technical experts to peace talks between Angola's leftist
government and U.S.-backed rebels, the State Department said
Monday.
   U.S. officials said the proposed assistance would be limited to
the mechanics of enforcing a cease-fire once negotiators for the
government and the rebels agree to take that step.
   The proposal represents another marked departure for the two
superpowers from their one-time bitter rivalry over Angola. The
Soviets have contributed military aid to the Angolan government
over the years while the United States has been arming the UNITA
rebels since 1986.
   Both are continuing to provide arms to their respective clients
but also seem eager to promote a settlement. The Angola war has
raged since 1976.
   Washington and Moscow ``have offered to provide experts at the
technical level for the next round of talks between UNITA and the
Luanda authorities, to be held under Portuguese auspices, and we
continue to urge both sides to move forward on the peace process,''
State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   The last round of talks between the two sides, held in Portugal,
broke down. Portuguese officials have been suggesting that a more
active U.S. and Soviet role might improve the chances for a
peaceful settlement.
   One example of the deep mistrust which has built up over the
years has been Angola's refusal to allow humanitarian food
shipments to be delivered to hungry Angolans in the southern part
of the country. Some are in UNITA-held territory while others are
in areas under government control.
   Angolan officials are worried that the United States might try
to slip weapons to its UNITA allies, using the food shipments as a
cover. The director of the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, Andrew Natsios, visited Angola last week to try to work
out an agreement but reportedly made no progress. U.S. officials
believe tens of thousands of Angolans face starvation unless food
deliveries begin soon.
   U.S. officials said food deliveries would be in the hands of the
International Committee for the Red Cross. They reject any
suggestion that food shipments would be used as a means of arming
the rebels.
   Mistrust also has been evident in the peace talks between the
two countries. UNITA wants recognition as a political entity before
a cease fire but Angola wants the sequence reversed. Each side
blamed the other for the breakdown of the Lisbon talks.

<HEAD>History Professor Wins Opposition Candidacy for Presidency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Ivorian Popular Front
on Monday chose a history professor as its presidential candidate
in this West African nation's first multiparty elections in 30
years.
   Laurent Gbagbo, 45, has been the chief rival of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, since the nation won independence from France in
1960.
   The university professor won the candidacy with 98 percent of
votes at his party's first congress, which began Sunday and ended
early Monday, a party statement said.
   He is the first candidate to declare for October's balloting,
the first multiparty vote since Houphouet-Boigny became president
four decades ago and named his party the sole legal political
organization in Ivory Coast.
   Twenty-five mostly left-leaning organizations have sprung up
since the Western-oriented Ivorian leader was forced to legalize
other political movements on April 30.
   That move came after unprecedented unrest and riots demanding
democracy and an end to the corruption that has helped impoverish
this once-wealthy state.
   Authorities, however, often have refused to allow government
opponents to hold rallies. Security forces twice this month used
tear gas and truncheons to break up peaceful marches by opposition
parties.
   Ivory Coast's problems began with tumbling world prices for
cocoa and coffee, its main exports. The government has been unable
to pay its foreign debt for two years, despite tax rates among the
highest in the world.
   Attempts to raise taxes even higher and cut the salaries of
government workers earlier this year fueled the worst unrest since
independence, forcing Houphouet-Boigny to back down on some
austerity measures.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Discuss Ways To Cut Medicaid Drug Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers looking for ways to stretch the
Medicaid dollar further considered proposals designed to cut
spiraling growth in the price of prescription drugs.
   Over the past decade, prescription drug prices have risen 152
percent while consumer prices have gone up 58 percent, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., sponsor of the proposals, told a Senate Finance
health subcommittee Monday.
   These ``unyielding and unfair'' prices have forced states to cut
back on Medicaid benefits, reimbursement rates for physicians and
the number of poor Americans who can participate in the program, he
said.
   ``In essence, the drug manufacturers are holding our states
hostage to their price increases,'' Pryor testified.
   Pryor's legislation would require drug companies to give the
Medicaid program the same discounts it gives other volume buyers,
like the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Defense Department,
hospitals and HMOs (Health Management Organizations). They get
discounts of as much as 60 percent.
   Medicaid drug costs for the current fiscal year are expected to
be $4.4 billion. Two years ago, the program paid $3.3 billion for
prescription drugs.
   Medicaid drug reimbursement proposals have been raised in the
current budget talks as a way to cut spending to meet Gramm-Rudman
targets.
   Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, said Pryor's legislation is unnecessary.
Currently, 42 states representing more than 90 percent of the
Medicaid drug market are negotiating with drug companies for
discounts and rebates, he said.
   The proposals also could be harmful to Medicaid patients, he
said.
   ``Drug therapy in Medicaid would be chosen by low-bid, not by
the medical judgment of the patient's physician,'' he said in
testimony submitted to the panel. ``The bill would thus result in
second-class medical care for Medicaid recipients.''
   He also said the legislation amounted to price controls, an idea
he called ``inimical to this country's free-market economy.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said he was troubled by price
controls as well as the possibility that restraints on the drug
industry would be a disincentive to continued research and
development of new drugs.
   ``We should not treat that lightly,'' Bradley said.
   Gail Wilensky, head of the federal agency that administers
Medicaid, also cautioned that ``we must use care to protect the
thriving (research and development) associated with prescription
drugs. And we must be concerned for what is one of our most
internationally cometitive industries.''

<HEAD>Recall Trucks to Fix Shift Levers, Consumer Group Demands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group on Monday demanded that Ford
Motor Co. recall 240,000 Ranger pickup trucks and Bronco II utility
vehicles to fix gear shift levers that in some cases have broken
off in the driver's hand.
   Ford's offer of free repair of any broken shift lever if the
truck is still under warranty is ``woefully inadequate,'' said
Samuel Cole, vehicle safety staffer for the Center for Auto Safety.
   ``Ford has designed a defect into these vehicles for which it
must now take proper action and conduct a recall,'' Cole said.
``With such a high failure rate, it will only be a matter of time
before we begin seeing accidents attributed to the gear shift
defect.''
   Ford spokeswoman Joy Stinson said the company did not consider
the problem a safety hazard. Even if the lever breaks, the vehicle
remains in gear and the driver is able to pull off the road without
losing control, she said.
   ``Whatever gear it breaks in, it's driveable,'' she said. ``For
that reason ... a safety recall is not warranted.''
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an
investigation of the gear lever problem last June.
   Ford provided the agency with a September 1988 internal report
that disclosed 6,473 gear shift lever failures on 1986 and 1987
Ranger pickups with manual transmissions made by Mazda.
   That translates into a failure rate of one in every 37 vehicles,
the Center for Auto Safety said.
   The Bronco II has the same transmission as the Ranger, Ms.
Stinson said.
   Ford began using an improved lever assembly with 1988 models.
   The company informed the government July 16 it would provide an
``extended warranty service program'' in which owners would receive
free repairs.
   But the offer covered only trucks whose levers had actually
broken and that were still covered by the company's six-year,
60,000-mile warranty.
   The Center for Auto Safety, in a letter to the government
agency, said the company should do more. An inability to shift
gears can result in loss of vehicle control and endanger lives, it
said.
   ``We believe a defect is a defect and ... Ford ought to own up
to it and recall the vehicles,'' Cole said.
   The center, a private consumer advocacy organization founded by
Ralph Nader, urged the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to order a recall of the Ford trucks and investigate
gear lever failures on Mazda vehicles using the same transmission.

   Iraq's Communist Party, part of the Iraqi
opposition based in Syria, said Monday that 58 people had been
killed in riots against the Baghdad government as of Sept. 7.
   The party said the rioters were shouting in demand for bread and
that violent measures taken by authorities to quell the
disturbances had caused the deaths.
   A party statement said 28 people had been killed in similar
riots in Bassora, where demonstrators demanded more bread and also
called for the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded on
Aug. 2. Food has been reported in short supply in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait since the invasion.
   There was no way to immediately confirm the report, which was

<TEXT>
   President Bush's galaxy of a ``thousand points
of light'' is now a quarter full.
   Bush named his 250th daily point of light on Monday: Linda
Warsaw, a 17-year-old San Bernardino, Calif., girl who founded
``Kids Against Crime.''
   Normally the honorees just get a letter signed by the president,
but Ms. Warsaw also got a phone call from the president from the
Oval Office.
   She founded ``Kids Against Crime'' in 1985 when she was 12 to
teach children how to protect themselves. She got the idea while
volunteering with the Victim Witness Assistance Program in the San
Bernardino County district attorney's office, the White House said.
   Teenage volunteers operate a hot line for youths to call when
they need advice and support.
   Bush first spoke of the thousand points of light in his
acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican convention, using it as a
metaphor for all the things Americans do, individually and in
groups, to help fellow citizens.
   Last year he began naming daily points of light six days a week
to encourage all Americans to perform community service. He plans
eventually to name 1,000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill letting regulators tap banks and
savings institutions to shore up the dwindling government deposit
insurance funds passed the House on Monday.
   By a voice vote, the House favored removing the legal ceiling on
insurance premiums levied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The Senate is scheduled to consider the measure later this month.
   Congressional leaders, the Bush administration and the FDIC are
supporting passage before Congress adjourns early next month.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the agency did not plan to
use the new power immediately but wanted it to meet any unforeseen
emergency.
   ``We don't see at this time we are going to change the premiums
again. However, it's an uncertain world and we thought we'd be
better equipped to handle things if we had the flexibility,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   The House action comes a week after the General Accounting
Office, Congress' auditing agency, warned that bank failures
produced by a recession could wipe out the fund protecting bank
deposits, requiring a taxpayer bailout.
   The fund protecting savings and loans has already been
bankrupted. As part of negotiations on the 1991 budget, Congress
and the administration are considering financing a second
installment of the rescue begun last year.
   The insurance premium bill is aimed at avoiding a similar
bailout for banks. According to its sponsor, Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee, it
gives the FDIC discretion to raise insurance premiums to whatever
level it considers appropriate.
   Seidman has warned that the bank fund is under ``considerable
stress'' and will probably experience its third consecutive loss
this year as bank failures remain near a post-Depression record.
   That would bring fund reseves down to near $11 billion, or
between 50 cents and 60 cents for every $100 of insured deposits.
That is less than half the $1.25 reserve ratio considered safe.
   ``The FDIC insurance fund is teetering on the brink of
insolvency,'' warned Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Banking financial institutions subcommittee.
   In an attempt to bolster the fund, the FDIC later this month is
expected to raise its 1991 bank premium from 12 cents per $100 of
deposits to 19.5 cents. It is the biggest increase allowed under
current law.
   Gonzalez' bill would scrap the 7.5 cent limit on annual
increases and the 32.5 upper ceiling on the premium. It would also
remove provisions restricting the agency to raising the premium
only once a year, requiring instead that the FDIC give 60 days
notice of increases as needed.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the senior Republican on the
banking committee, said premiums may not have to be raised more
than planned, but said it would be irresponsible to taxpayers for
Congress not to give the FDIC power to take swift action.
   ``We are practicing an ounce of prevention before a pound of
cure is needed,'' he said.
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said industry groups were not
lobbying against Gonzalez' bill.
   But he said bankers worried that the fast-track procedure
Congress is using to adopt the measure is creating a false
impression that there is an emergency in the banking system.
   With the premium increase already planned, the FDIC will have an
additional $6 billion next year to pay for bank failures, he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Hopes International Lending Agencies Will Aid Mideast Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it would
look to international lending agencies to help alleviate Mideast
nations' economic hardships stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Treasury Deputy Secretary David Mulford said the question of
financial assistance to support the trade embargo against Iraq
would be a primary topic at meetings which begin in Washington over
the weekend of the 151-nation International Monetary Fund and its
sister organization, the World Bank.
   Mulford earlier this month accompanied Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady on a world trip to pass the hat among the allies for
financial aid to support the trade embargo and to help defray the
$1 billion-a-month costs of the U.S. military buildup.
   Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia and the exiled government of
Kuwait have made significant contributions to the $28 billion pool
of money the administration is trying to gather.
   Mulford did not provide any specifics about what amounts of
money the administration would be seeking from the international
lending agencies. But he said there were numerous needs that had to
be addressed for the so-called front-line states of Egypt, Jordan
and Turkey.
   He said financial assistance was needed to cushion the shock
from the loss of export markets because of the trade embargo,
higher oil prices and a tide of refugees from Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``There is a very real crisis situation with immediate problems
that need to be addressed,'' Mulford told reporters during a
briefing.
   Mulford said Egypt, Turkey and Jordan needed an emergency
transfusion of money without strings attached. The administration
previously has talked of the need for $3.5 billion for those
countries before the end of the year with another $7 billion needed
next year.
   In addition to aid to the front-line states, the IMF and World
Bank were expected to address providing assistance to other poor
nations hurt by such things as the rise in oil prices.
   Mulford said the issue of economic assistance would be taken up
by finance ministers and central bankers of the world's seven
richest countries when they meet Saturday in advance of the IMF and
World Bank meetings.
   The other countries - Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Italy and Canada - have been at the top of the list of nations to
participate in Bush's burden-sharing campaign among allies.
   In addition to the Persian Gulf, the finance meetings will
address the problem of economic difficulties facing the Soviet
Union.
   For the first time in history, the Soviets will be attending the
annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank as ``special invitees,'' a
designation that will allow them to attend the full sessions of the
two organizations but not the policy-making meetings of the IMF
Interim Committee and the joint IMF-World Bank Development
Committee.
   The Soviet Union has expressed an interest in joining the World
Bank and the IMF and has been appealing for direct aid from the
West to prop up the faltering Soviet economy.
   The administration has opposed direct aid until the Soviets make
bigger strides in developing a free-market economy and Mulford said
that position had not changed.

<TEXT>
   Higher oil prices since the Persian Gulf
crisis and global warming could give nuclear energy a boost,
according to delgates to an international conference on the atomic
energy.
   Also at the opening session of the five-day International Atomic
Energy Agency conference, delegates chose a Kuwaiti as one of the
meeting's vice presidents, in essence rejecting Iraq's claim over
the oil-wealthy emirate.
   Abdul Hamid Abdullah al-Hawadih was chosen to represent the
Middle East. His nomination was endorsed by all delegations but
Iraq's, which argued Kuwait ceased to exist following Baghdad's
Aug. 2 invasion and annexation of the emirate.
   The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. group hosting
the conference, suspended cooperation with Iraq in the wake of its
attack on Kuwait.
   The conference is being attended by more than 300 delegates from
most of the agency's 113 member-nations.
   During the opening session at Vienna's Austria Cente, delegates
and officials suggested the gulf crisis and global warming could
give atomic energy a new lease on life, if public confidence can be
restored.
   Agency Director General Hans Blix told delegates the crisis had
reminded the world ``once again of the need to diversify energy
sources.''
   Outgoing Conference President Kunmo Chung of South Korea said:
``Nuclear power is being taken out of the closet like an old but
usable suit.''
   In addition to rising oil prices, Blix said fears of global
warming - caused by generating energy from fossil fuels such as
coal, oil and gas - has turned many countries to nuclear power.
   Currently, 17 percent of the world's electricity needs are met
by nuclear power. To match that output, he said, fossil fuel power
stations would have to churn an extra 1.8 billion tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.
   Partly because of nuclear power, reliance on oil to generate
electricity in industrialized nations fell from 24 percent in 1974
to 9 percent in 1986, Blix said.
   U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore told the conference
that prospects for restoring the nuclear option worldwide are
``good, if we can restore public confidence in the operational
safety of nuclear facilities.''
   However, he acknowledged that was unlikely in the near future.
The United States, which runs one-quarter of the world's nuclear
stations, will not increase nuclear electricity production over the
next decade, he said.
   ``Nuclear power is not growing in the United States for a very
basic reason: many people are afraid ... of accidents like
Chernobyl,'' he said.
   The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which spread radioactive
waste across Europe, focused international attention on the safety
of Soviet-built East European reactors.
   Thirty-one people died in the accident, and some reports say
hundreds more who worked to clean up the site have died in the
ensuing four years.
   According to Blix, former Communist governments across Eastern
Europe expanded nuclear programs ``without much public
discussion.''
   But he said the advent of democracy in the East has now also put
nuclear power there under just as much scrutiny and criticism as in
the West.
   The Soviet Union and the United States were expected to sign an
agreement Tuesday on nuclear waste disposal. The Soviets were to
submit plans for a nuclear research center on the effects of
radioactive contamination at Chernobyl, said spokesman Hans
Friedrich Meyer.

<DATELINE>AZRAQ, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's government on Monday shut the last
of three makeshift refugee camps and moved the remaining residents
into two clean, efficient tent villages.
   Flaps on the empty tents at Shaalan II snapped in the hot desert
wind, and garbage blew across the scorpion-infested sand near
Ruweishid along the Iraqi border.
   Hans Everts, a coordinator with the French humanitarian group
Medicins Sans Frontieres, looked relaxed as he sipped a soda after
his first good night's sleep since the flood of refugees began
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We don't expect another big influx,'' he said about two hours
after the official midday closing of the camp. ``There will
continue to be another 2,000 or so people crossing each day for the
foreseeable future. But Jordan has it all magnificently organized.
It's time for us to go home.''
   Shaalan I, which once contained about 45,000 people fleeing
Kuwait and Iraq, closed on Thursday. Mercy Camp tents emptied
Sunday. The government has said it will set up a small border
receiving station for new refugees.
   The fortunate refugees from the border camps headed directly for
planes or ferries home. About 18,000 mostly Asian refugees
transferred to Azraq I and II, a sweep of thousands of olive drab
or white tents on the desert steppes near a ancient fort where T.E.
Lawrence planned the Arab revolt against the Ottomans.
   The tents stand in precise rows, divided into sectors by
national groups, each served by a water line.
   The desperation in the makeshift border camps, which only two
weeks ago led to fights over water and food, has given way to
camaraderie at Azraq, 120 miles to the west. Cooler weather has
calmed flaring tempers as well. Temperatures rose to 120 degrees at
Shaalan in August, but range from 90 during the day to about 60 at
night at Azraq.
   Monday morning at Azraq II, Sri Lankans exchanged greetings with
Filipinos, and a Bangladeshi helped an Indian woman carry a plastic
bucket of water. In the cool morning wind, people strolled the
sandy hills near the camp wrapped in blankets.
   In tent no. 92, Ernesto Callejo thanked God he didn't panic and
flee Kuwait in the first wave. After Iraqi troops stormed into
Kuwait City on Aug. 2, Callejo gathered the other 250 Fillipino
members of the local Church of Christ and began calmly planning to
leave.
   ``We didn't want to leave anybody behind,'' he said, surrounded
by a dozen of his compatriots and friends.
   For three weeks, the group gathered drums to fill with water,
collected food and avoided occupation troops, finally renting a
truck for the drive to Baghdad. If they had left earlier, they
might have spent weeks at the border camps. Instead, they went
directly from Baghdad to Azraq.
   Callejo said that during their three-day stay in Baghdad, they
had money but still had trouble finding anything to eat.
   ``Now our money is gone but they are feeding us. God and the
Jordanian government provide,'' he said.
   Styrofoam cartons filled with apples, cucumbers, grapes and
tomatoes were stacked in the shade of a storage tent next to a camp
clinic. A half-dozen doctors with the Jordanian Red Crescent
supervised nurses from the Order of the Sacred Heart, bustling
about in snow-white habits and Nike sneakers.
   Khaled Abu-Halimeh, medical director at the camp, said 500 Sri
Lankans would be leaving the camp Monday along with Bangladeshis
and Indians.
   But 3,000 more refugees arrived Monday from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Dozens of evacuation flights leave daily from Amman. By official
count Sunday, 14,850 people arrived Saturday in Jordan while 19,768
departed.
   For Priscilla Ponsece, a member of Collejo's group, things
weren't moving fast enough.
   ``We pray every day to go home,'' she said. ``And this morning
we made a Philippine flag and raised it over our tent while we sang
the national anthem.
   ``This camp is very nice, but we're not home yet,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bush Claims Providing Clear Sense Of Direction In Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush claimed credit Monday for
helping give Americans for the first time ``a clear sense of
direction'' about the nation's schools.
   He made the boast at a ceremony on the White House lawn honoring
221 public and private elementary schools that won the Department
of Education's excellence awards.
   He also used the occasion to salute Polly Williams, a Wisconsin
state representative from Milwaukee who has championed educational
choice for inner-city youths.
   Bush called the Democratic lawmaker ``a courageous leader who
brought choice to Milwaukee'' and asked her to take a bow.
   She sponsored a plan against opposition from local public
educators and civil rights leaders that is providing 1,000
Milwaukee students with vouchers to help pay tuition at private
schools.
   Bush called educational choice ``one of the most important
reforms sweeping our great country.''
   Bush told the more than 500 educators at the ceremony that,
``For the first time, Americans now have a clear sense of direction
toward national education.''
   He said his educational summit with the nation's governors in
Charlottesville, Va., last September had helped produce that
consensus. Four governors - Carroll Campbell Jr. of South Carolina,
Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, Rudy Perpich of Minnesota and William
Schaefer of Maryland - also attended the event.
   Bush recited the goals for the schools that he and the governors
have endorsed, including making American youth tops in the world in
math and science and raising the high school graduation rate to 90
percent by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
   Cool weather asserted itself over much of the nation Monday,
with midday snow flurries in upstate New York, record lows in
Michigan, and frost advisories extending into the central
Appalachians.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally only in the 50s and 60s
from the northern and central high Plains to the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast. Readings also were in the 60s in the
Northwest.
   In the Finger Lakes wine country of upstate New York, snow
flurries were reported between around midday at Naples, about 40
miles south of Rochester.
   ``There was no accumulation. Too warm on the ground,'' said
meteorologist Eric Schwibs of the National Weather Service in
Rochester. He said the area's altitude of about 2,000 feet combined
with 40-degree temperatures to make it cold enough for snow.
   The brief flurries even caught forecasters off guard.
   ``It's still summer - technically,'' Schwibs said.
   Overnight temperatures dipped into the 30s across parts of the
upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region and northern New
England, with freezing temperatures reported in the upper Great
Lakes region.
   Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., on Lake Superior, was the cold spot in
the Lower 48 states Monday morning with a record low of 27, the
coldest reading on record for so early in the season there.
Elsewhere in Michigan, Muskegon tied its record low of 36.
   A freeze warning was posted overnight into Tuesday morning for
extreme western Maryland and the northern mountains of western
Pennsylvania. Frost warnings issued for the rest of western
Maryland and the southern and central mountains of northwestern
Pennsylvania.
   Frost and freeze warnings were issued for Vermont and for parts
of eastern New York state north of the Mohawk Valley.
   Frost advisories were issued for extreme western Virginia, much
of western New York state and for much of the mountains of West
Virginia.
   In the West, Ely, Nev., reported a low of 35 and Truckee,
Calif., reported a low of 31.
   Temperatures in the 90s were primarily confined to Florida and
the rest of the Gulf Coast, and to the desert Southwest.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered from Arkansas to
the central high Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over the western
Gulf Coast and southern and central Florida.
   A few showers dotted the Northeast.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
0.78 of an inch at Dyess Air Force Base at Abilene, Texas.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health insurance and the right to
strike without jeopardizing jobs are basic privileges worth
fighting for, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Monday at the
United Mine Workers union convention.
   The AFL-CIO will push for a bill before Congress that would bar
employers from permanently replacing striking workers, Kirkland
said as the UMW began its 100th anniversary convention.
   ``The right to strike without losing your job - that's a basic
right recognized in all but the most backward or repressive
nations,'' he told the coal miners' delegates.
   ``We enter the 1990s a stronger and, I believe, wiser and more
determined labor movement after enduring the frustrations of the
1980s - a decade of excess, avarice and illusions in which the rich
got richer while multitudes struggled to hold on to the very bottom
rung of the social ladder,'' Kirkland said.
   Kirkland said the UMW's 10-month strike against The Pittston Co.
at mines and coal processing plants in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky illustrates the power of a unified labor movement.
   The UMW rejoined the AFL-CIO last year, four decades after
withdrawing, and the two groups worked together on the Pittston
strike.
   ``Your struggle and your victory brought the entire labor
movement together, and for that the whole labor movement owes you a
debt of gratitude,'' Kirkland told the miners.
   The union declared victory in the bitter Pittston strike, but it
was a costly win. A financial disclosure form shows the union's net
worth fell by $45 million in 1989, down to $126 million.
   The UMW is struggling to overturn $52 million in fines levied by
a Virginia judge because of the strike. The union also faces more
than $1 billion in lawsuits filed by companies idled by a five-week
wildcat strike that began in sympathy with the Pittston strikers.
   Kirkland also called health care a basic right but said ``we
know that the collective bargaining process alone cannot solve the
colossal health care crisis that is bankrupting workers and denying
basic medical coverage to nearly one-third of our fellow
Americans.''
   ``Health care is a chief issue in nearly every contract
negotiation, and now it's the key factor for nearly four-fifths of
all striking workers,'' he said.
   Also Monday, UMW President Richard Trumka blamed the Persian
Gulf crisis on the lack of a federal energy policy, which he said
holds the United States hostage to an ``oil-soaked Middle East
dictator.''
   ``The only reason that characters like Saddam Hussein have any
power at all is because of the oil they have - oil we could have
replaced years ago with coal mined in the United States and
Canada,'' Trumka said, referring to the Iraqi president.
   The celebration of the once-powerful union's centennial is
dogged by financial and legal concerns.
   During the nine-day meeting, delegates will be asked to give the
International Executive Board, the UMW's governing body, authority
to close or merge the 21 districts to help the union save money.
Several of the largely autonomous districts are insolvent because
of layoffs.
   They also will decide whether to allow the governing body use of
interest earnings from the $60 million strike fund to pay legal
expenses and other costs associated with strikes. Currently, the
fund can be used only to pay benefits to strikers.
   And the delegates will be asked to approve changes UMW leaders
say they need to deal with multinational corporations in the world
coal market.

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi prince stopped himself as
soon as he realized his lunch guest was taking notes.
   ``Can we do this, how do you say, off the record, or on
background?'' the prince asked. ``I do not want to be quoted by
name.''
   The prince then launched into a series of questions about
reporting ground rules, ultimately deciding his conversation was on
background - he could not be identified by name but agreed to be
cited as a Saudi prince or senior Saudi official.
   By the time lunch was over, the prince had approached several
other reporters, beginning each conversation with the greeting:
``Let us talk on background.'' As his guests left, the prince
boasted to one: ``I am a quick learner, don't you think?''
   Indeed, many Saudi officials, in the government and military,
have proved fast learners in media relations, although they have
not always satisfied the more than 500 journalists who have visited
Saudi Arabia in the past six weeks to cover the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``We wanted to please everybody and we are trying to please
everybody,'' a Saudi diplomatic official said recently. ``We are
not perfect but I think we should get appreciation, not
complaints.''
   The most frequent complaints are that the Saudis are slow to
respond to requests. Saudis traditionally are not in as much of a
rush as Americans and other Westerners.
   ``We are dealing with two cultures here and you have to
understand that,'' the Saudi official said. ``We have nothing
against you.''
   The Saudis also are highly sensitive to unapproved photography
and often insist that reporters accustomed to working alone travel
with a government escort.
   But they have improved their handling of media affairs.
   A vast public affairs office has been established alongside the
U.S. military's information bureau. Taking tips from the military,
the Saudis now have a number of regular trips they organize fo
reporters, including one to see Saudi and other Arab troops near
the Kuwaiti border.
   They are showing signs of trying to respond to requests more
rapidly.
   The latest example of this came late Saturday night, when word
surfaced that Iraqi troops had opened the Kuwaiti border with Saudi
Arabia and were letting Kuwaitis leave their occupied homeland.
   Reporters wanted to go to the border right away, but Saudi
officials refused to provide escorts until a government-sponsored
trip the following morning. After several objections were raised,
the Saudis called in a bus and headed north to the border,
reporters in tow, at 2:40 a.m.
   As they get used to their new role, the Saudis also are
borrowing some tricks from U.S. politicians.
   Saudi officials rarely speak for the record on any substantive
matter. When asked sensitive questions, few Saudis will give direct
answers, preferring instead to talk off the record or in sweeping
generalities, not unlike many policy-makers in Washington.
   The current media crush in Saudi Arabia at times appears to pose
difficult conflicts for the Saudis, who have shown an eagerness to
reach out to the Western world through its media but remain fearful
of offending powerful conservative elements of the society.
   A clear example of this scenario came during the discussion over
whether to stage an immediate trip to the border area.
   A half-dozen Saudi officials publicly preached the same official
line: that there was no abnormal activity at the border. But
several privately told reporters there was indeed a rush of
Kuwaitis at the border, and they were influential in arranging the
quick trip to the border.
   One official pulled aside an AP reporter just before the
reporter headed to the border in a private car.
   ``We are being told the official line is what you get, to keep
you guys from rushing up there,'' the official said. ``But about
1,000 have crossed and more are expected. It's busy up there. But
please don't say how you found that out. I would be in big
trouble.''

<BYLINE>RTC Cancels Satellite Auction for Million-Dollar S&amp;L Properties.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal savings and loan bailout officials
said Monday they were canceling the much-promoted international
satellite auction of million-dollar properties inherited from
bankrupt savings and loans.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said
the auction was canceled after the Auction Company of America,
which the agency had hired, did not contribute to a joint fund
promoting the event.
   ``The group we contracted with couldn't fulfill their end of the
deal,'' Seidman said in a telephone interview.
   Jim Gall, chairman of the Miami-based Auction Company of
America, disputed Seidman and accused the bailout agency of
bungling the auction. He said his firm has spent nearly $2 million
over four months to prepare for the event, about what it was
obligated to spend.
   The auction was to be held Nov. 15 in Dallas, Texas, with
satellite hookups to bidders in nine other U.S. cities as well as
Tokyo and London.
   The RTC had hoped to sell 71 properties valued at $300 million.
The auction was a centerpiece for what the agency had billed as its
``great fall inventory clearance sale'' aimed at drastically
slimming its ballooning inventory of S&amp;L assets.
   ``We hope to start over. ... It's going to slow us up a little
but, but I don't think it's a major blow,'' Seidman said.
   Gall faulted the RTC for failing to set minimum prices for the
properties and for withdrawing three properties from the auction
list and selling them using other methods.
   Gall said potential buyers must have some assurance the
properties will remain on the auction list or they will be
unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on the environmental,
engineering and appraisal reports needed to offer an intelligent
bid.
   ``We've lost investor after investor,'' Gall said in a telephone
interview.
   He said a low or no minimum auction price also is needed to
stimulate interest in an auction by holding out the prospect for a
bargain, he said.
   ``To this day, the agency hasn't put out reserve prices,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and President Vaclav Havel agreed Monday on the need for
tougher measures against Iraq, and Havel indicated Czechoslovakia
may expel Iraqi diplomats.
   Mrs. Thatcher, making the first visit by a British leader to
Czechoslovakia since World War II, also said the European Community
should extend membership to the new democracies of Eastern Europe
once they implement economic reforms.
   But she was adamant that Britain would give no large-scale
financial aid, and that major investment was unlikely in
Czechslovakia until Prague has established a private enterprise
economy.
   The visit has been billed by British and Czechoslovak officials
as ending decades of icy relations between Prague and London after
Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution ousted ruling Communists in
November.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Havel addressed a joint news conference at
Prague Castle after 2{ hours of talks.
   She said the expulsion by the European Community of Iraqi
military attaches Monday reflected shared anger at Iraq's invasion
last week of official residences or compounds of France and three
other countries.
   ``We naturally wished to act together over the outrage by Iraqi
troops,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, whose government expelled 31 Iraqi
embassy personnel and students.
   Asked if Czechoslovakia planned to join the West European action
against Iraqi diplomats, Havel said: ``It does not depend only on
me, but it seems the situation is evolving in that direction.''
   ``The only difference between England and Czechoslovakia is that
we can't send our navy ... because we haven't got one,'' said
Havel. ``But we are looking at a number of other possibilities on
how to face this evil, which is embodied by the aggressive regime
of President Hussein.''
   He referred to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, whose troops
overran Kuwait on Aug. 2 and subsequently annexed the oil-wealthy
emirate.
   Havel said he had no major differences with Mrs. Thatcher over
her policy of restricting aid now largely to sending advisors to
help along economic restructuring.
   ``If you are going to get investment in, we have got to be
certain the old bureaucracy - industry run by government - has
gone,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in an interview published Monday in a
Prague newspaper, Lidove Noviny.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived Sunday with her husband, Denis, at
the start of the three-nation European tour that will also take her
to Hungary and Switzerland, was greeted at the ornate Hradcany
Castle by a guard of honor.
   Havel - playwright and one-time dissident - and the British
Conservative Party leader stood side by side in the autumn sunshine
as a military band played the national anthems and a jaunty
welcoming march.
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher warned Czechs and Slovaks not to allow
ethnic differences mar the democracy they have won after decades of
Communist rule.
   ``It would be a great tragedy if people merely used freedom to
emphasize differences,'' a British official quoted Mrs. Thatcher as
telling leaders of the Czech republic.
   The new federal government and the country's Czech and Slovak
republics are trying to draw up new constitutions that will satisfy
calls for less centralized power.
   Before meeting Havel, Mrs. Thatcher, swept through this historic
capital in an armored-plated Jaguar to visit the city's Jewish
cemetery and a museum commemorating the victims of Nazi
concentration camps in World War II.
   She is to address the Czechoslovak Parliament Tuesday before
flying to Bratislava in the Slovak republic.

<TEXT>
   Angola's Marxist government does not
want United States or Soviet observers at the next round of peace
talks with UNITA rebels, the official Angolan news agency said
Monday.
   The Portuguese government, acting as unofficial mediator in the
conflict, had asked Moscow and Washington to send observers to the
talks, slated for Sept. 24 in Portugal.
   The move was to pressure the Angolan foes into a compromise to
end the 15-year-old civil war, Portuguese officials said.
   The United States is believed to channel more than $50 million
in aid to UNITA yearly. The Soviet Union backs Angola's government.
   The last round of talks in Lisbon last month stumbled over a
UNITA demand that the government recognize the group as a
legitimate political party before a cease-fire.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union have indicated they
would send observers if both government and rebels wished.
   But Venancio de Moura, Angolan vice-minister for foreign
relations, said Saturday in Namibia that such participation would
not be useful, Angola's ANGOP news agency reported.
   ``On the contrary, we consider it premature,'' de Moura was
quoted as saying.
   He said a truce could be reached this month if UNITA dropped its
demands for explicit political recognition.
   UNITA spokesmen said recently the rebels had rejected a
government proposal offering UNITA ``special status'' but falling
short of full political recognition. He said, however, the rebels
would make it easier for the government to recognize them during
the next round of talks.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos also said recently the
rebels have intensified their attacks, ``making it difficult to
build a climate favorable to national reconciliation,'' ANGOP
reported.
   UNITA fighters said last week they would scale back attacks in
response to a plea from the Organization of African Unity.
   UNITA - the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
- has been fighting the government since Angola gained independence
from Portugal in 1975.

   Today is Tuesday, Sept. 18, the 261st day of 1990. There are 104
days left in the year.
   On Sept. 18, 1793, President George Washington laid the
cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol, using a silver trowel and
marble-headed gavel to put the stone in place, in accordance with
Masonic ritual.
   On this date:
   In 1759, the French formally surrendered Quebec to the British.
   In 1769, the Boston Gazette reported on the first piano built in
the U.S., a spinet with a three-to-four octave range.
   In 1810, Chile declared its independence from Spain.
   In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which allowed
slaveowners to reclaim slaves who had escaped into other states.
   In 1851, the first issue of The New York Times was published.
   In 1873, a panic caused by the failure of the brokerage firm of
Jay Cooke and Company resulted in a five-year depression.
   In 1927, the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting System, later CBS,
made its debut with a basic network of 16 radio stations.
   In 1940, 50 years ago, Harper and Brothers published ``You Can't
Go Home Again'' by Thomas Wolfe.
   In 1947, the United States Air Force was established as a
separate branch of the military.
   In 1961, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold died
in a plane crash in northern Rhodesia.
   In 1970, 20 years ago, rock star Jimi Hendrix died in London at
age 27.
   In 1975, newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst was captured by the
FBI in San Francisco, 19 months after she was kidnapped by the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
   In 1987, President Reagan announced that he and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev would meet later in the year to sign a treaty
banning medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter told a news conference the
United States was ``not going to apologize'' for past actions in
Iran. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Katherine Anne Porter died in
Silver Spring, Md., at age 90.
   Five years ago: President Reagan publicly confirmed the release
of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, an American held hostage in Lebanon for
14 months. U.S. officials had kept Weir's release a secret in hopes
that other hostages would also be freed.
   One year ago: Hurricane Hugo reached Puerto Rico, causing
extensive damage as it continued to barrel toward the U.S.
mainland.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Rossano Brazzi is 74. Actor Jack Warden
is 70. Singer Frankie Avalon is 50. Baseball player Ryne Sandberg
is 31.
   Thought for today: ``Loneliness ... is and always has been the
central and inevitable experience of every man.'' - From ``You
Can't Go Home Again,'' by Thomas Wolfe, American author
(1900-1938).

<HEAD>California Businessman Pleads Guilty to Bribery for Navy Contracts</HEAD>

   A California businessman pleaded guilty Monday
to conspiring to bribe two Navy procurement officials by paying
them more than $26,000 to help his company obtain lucrative
electronics contracts.
   Manuel R. Caldera, 59, former chairman of Amex Systems, Inc., of
Los Angeles, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pay bribes and making
an illegal payment to a public official.
   Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years
imprisonment and fines of $500,000.
   The guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in
Alexandria, Va., marked the latest conviction in the government's
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud.
   Thirty-nine defense consultants, procurement officials and
contractors plus several companies have been convicted since the
investigation known as ``Operation Ill Wind'' became public more
than two years ago.
   Caldera, a Mexican-American who was honored in 1983 by President
Reagan as a minority businessman, admitted paying bribes to former
Navy procurement officials Stuart E. Berlin and James D. Sampson
between 1978 and 1985.
   The two former officials, who worked for the Naval Electronics
System Command in Arlington, Va., agreed to approve additional
contract work for Amex in return for the money, according to court
papers.
   Sampson, who has not been charged, and Berlin, who is serving a
26-month prison term for his guilty plea to unrelated charges, are
cooperating with the investigation.
   The conspiracy charge to which Caldera pleaded guilty listed
payments of $26,000 between 1982 and 1985. A statement of facts
filed by prosecutors indicated payments totalled $34,000 between
1978 and 1985.
   Until 1984, Amex was eligible to obtain government contracts
without competing with other firms because it was a minority-owned
business, prosecutors said. The minority-business preference ended
shortly before Amex was sold to Allied Corp. for $45 million.
   Hilton scheduled sentencing for Nov. 30.

   Residents of this town southwest of
Little Rock won't be able to return home for two or three days
while a toxic acid spill caused by a train derailment is cleaned
up, authorities said Monday.
   The town's 345 residents were evacuated when one derailed car
began leaking highly corrosive nitric acid, some of which
evaporated to form a cloud over the town, said Gary Talley of the
state Office of Emergency Services.
   ``The car is upside down and it looks like the leak is on the
underside,'' Talley said.
   Until the all of the chemical is drained and either evaporates
or is neutralized there is little authorities can do but secure the
area, he said.
   ``We're gearing up for two to three days,'' Talley said. He said
that meant the earliest residents could return home was late
Tuesday afternoon.
   About 10,000 gallons of nitric acid was expected to leak from
the 17,386-gallon tank car, Davis said.
   An earthen dam was built to contain that acid, said Niolan
Spain, emergency service coordinator for Ouachia County. He said
they didn't plan to do anything with that pool of acid until
morning.
   The 51-car train was on a regular run between Gurdon and El
Dorado when eight cars derailed at 4:45 a.m., according to Mark
Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific in Omaha, Neb.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   No injuries were reported.
   Nitric acid can irritate the skin, eyes and mucous membranes,
and cause burns, depending on its concentration, said Robert L.
Horn, public health laboratory director for the state Health
Department. The acid is non-combustible, but will accelerate the
burning of combustible materials.

   Scores of timber industry workers asked
congressmen Monday not to destroy jobs by sharply reduced timber
cutting, while environmentalists lobbied for legislation to protect
the Northwest's ancient forests.
   ``I'm scared for my family,'' said Judy Marr, who runs a small
logging company in northwestern Washington and said she was worried
about legislation that would reduce timber harvests.
   ``For us it's not a weekend hike or a walk every five years. For
us, it's an everyday lifestyle.''
   Ms. Marr was among about 200 loggers, mill workers and community
leaders from Oregon and Washington state who sought out members of
Congress to plead that they keep the plight of timber workers in
mind when considering legislation that would reduce timber cutting.
   Legislation that would ban logging on 6.3 million acres
including about 2.7 million acres currently open to timber harvests
is expected to be considered by the House Interior Committee later
this week.
   The push to protect Northwest forests intensified this summer
when the spotted owl was declared protected under the Endangered
Species Act. Scientists say the only way to ensure the owl's
survival is to restricting logging.
   A federal task force has been trying to work out ways to protect
the owl, but still minimize the economic impact on timber workers.
   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., said White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu has told him that there is little liklihood that
environmental and economic considerations could be balanced in the
spotted owl deliberations without Congress changing the Endangered
Species Act.
   He said Sununu urged that Congress change the law. But Smith as
well as Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said they do not believe there
are enough votes in Congress to do that.
   Valerie Johnson, leader of the Oregon Lands Coalition, said the
Northwest is the latest region to fall victim to overzealous
environmental legislation that is causing ``social havoc and human
suffering'' among timber industry workers and related businesses.
   ``We are all being told that Americans don't need us any more,''
she said.
   Meanwhile some 500 environmentalists also fanned out among the
congressional offices to lobby against legislation they said would
further destroy the Northwest's dwindling old-growth forests.
   Frances Hunt of the National Wildlife Federation said the
economic plight of the timber workers was wrongly being blamed on
conservationists' attempts to preserve the ancient forests.
   ``We have already lost 90 percent of the old-growth ecosystem.
It is not the last 10 percent that is putting them out of work, it
is the 90 percent that was cut before,'' she said.
   The timber workers gave Smith a petition with 40,000 signatures
from families concerned about their future and asked congressmen to
``weigh both the scientific evidence and the social price tag''
when considering such issues as the protection of the threatened
spotted owl.
   ``We didn't come to Washington to ask Congress for a handout. We
came to ask for the opportunity to continue working,'' said Doug
Robertson, a county commissioner from heavily timber-dependent
Roseburg, Ore. contested bid for re-election, said the Northwest
residents face an uphill battle.

<HEAD>Bush Asks New Yorkers Lobby for Crime Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday that New Yorkers
alarmed about crime should lean on Congress to enact an
administration bill to stiffen penalties against criminals and
build more jail cells.
   At a news conference, Bush said that ``soft treatment of the
criminal ... sends exactly the wrong signal to those embattled
citizens.''
   ``I'd like to see our crime bill pass,'' he said. ``I think that
would send a good message to the policemen on the streets of New
York that we plan to back them up more.''
   Bush's anticrime bill has been stalled in Congress since last
year. It's provisions include the death penalty for ``drug
kingpins.'' On that point, Bush said, ``We've got a difference with
some in New York on that one.'' He did not cite any opponents by
name.
   New York has been stunned by random shootings whose victims have
included innocent children and other bystanders. Last month, a
22-year-old visitor from Utah, Brian Watkins, was stabbed to death
when he tried to protect his parents during a subway mugging.
   On another subject, Bush criticized the tactics of some AIDS
activists, singling out protestors who disrupted a recent speech by
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan at an AIDs
conference in San Francisco.
   ``I must say, some of the excesses of those groups does not help
the cause,'' the president said. ``I had a lot of mail saying
people were quite embarrassed by that.''
   Speaking about the economy, Bush said, ``I don't think there's a
financial crisis. I think the economy's growth is slow. I do not
think that nationally we're in a recession.''
   He acknowledged that New England states, with heavy unemployment
and other economic problems, were undergoing ``a very difficult
situation.''
   He said, ``Other areas of the country have gone through similar
regional downturns ... I think the best thing the federal
government can do is to get these interest rates down and to adopt
growth incentives so that people will continue to create jobs.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House by a 368-0 vote gave final approval
Monday to legislation that would give free mailing privileges to
U.S. troops deployed in the Persian Gulf.
   The legislation now goes to President Bush. The Senate approved
the measure by voice vote last week.
   Under current law, free mailing privileges are extended to
members of the armed forces engaged in hostilities. This
legislation would extend free mail to participants in Operation
Desert Shield, including those aboard ships.
   The free postage would apply to cards, letters and audio
cassettes.
   Members of a recent congressional delegation visiting Saudi
Arabia heard troops complain they were unable to purchase stamps,
and that stamps brought from home were made unusable by the extreme
heat.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would
cost between $6 million and $8 million in fiscal 1991, money that
the Defense Department would pay to the Postal Service.
   The Postal Service sought to institute the free mail last week,
but the Pentagon refused to begin the program without legislation.

   Iraq on Monday rejected a proposed visit
to Iraq and Kuwait by the secretary-general's envoy for
humanitarian aid, and Kuwait's ambassador filed a protest against
alleged Iraqi atrocities.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of Pakistan had been appointed by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to oversee U.N. aid in
the gulf crisis. Perez de Cuellar appealed last week to Iraq to
allow Aga Khan to make a visit to determine food and medicine needs
- especially those of foreigners.
   Emerging from a visit with Perez de Cuellar, Ambassador Abdul
Amir Al-Anbari said Iraq rejected the visit, as well as the
Security Council's call for aid to be delivered to Iraq and Kuwait
through non-Iraqi organizations.
   ``Iraq is the cradle of civilization and not just another poor
country,'' Al-Anbari said, describing the U.N. plan for food
deliveries as ``humiliating.''
   Meanwhile, the Security Council's sanction commmitte recommended
the international community provide aid to Jordan, which is heavily
dependent on Iraqi commerce.
   Jordan is one of 10 nations, including India, Sri Lanka,
Bulgaria and the Philippines, which have requested relief from the
sweeping U.N. trade embargo intended to compel the withdrawal of
Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   The five permanent Security Council members - the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union - met Monday to discuss
the possible expansion of enforcement measures against Iraq to
include an aerial blockade and sanctions against countries that
violate the embargo.
   The existing embargo already covers air traffic, in theory, but
the Security Council has only permitted the use of force to halt
maritime traffic, to allow ships to be stopped and boarded and
their cargoes inspected.
   The United States, Britain, France support the new restrictions,
but China and the Soviet Union were said to be opposed to the
aerial blockade.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
expected the Security Council this week to adopt a resolution that
would take punitive measures against violators of the embargo.
   An air blockade is considered risky because halting planes is
difficult without the use of deadly force. Numerous international
conventions protect civil aviation.
   Meanwhile, Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad Abulhassan said in a
letter to Perez de Cuellar that `the entire population of Kuwait,
including third country nationals, is being subjected to a reign of
terror, systematically planned and relentlessly pursued by the
Iraqi occupiers.''
   Iraqi ``criminal practices are being stepped up with the
sinister objected of making life under occupation so inteolerable
that the population is forced out, in order to alter the
demographics of Kuwait,'' the letter said.
   Some Kuwaitis have speculated Saddam Hussein wants to repopulate
Kuwait with Iraqis. An estimated 300,000 of Kuwait's native
population of 570,000 have fled since Iraq invaded on Aug. 2.
   Abulhassan also wrote that many Kuwaitis have been arrested for
refusing to collaborate with occupation forces, and some of them
``are being subjected to all sorts of intimidation and physical
torture.''
   In the presence of a large crowd, Iraqi troops shot to death
Mubarak Faleh Al Note, the chairman of a cooperative society,
Abulhassan said, when he refused to hang a portrait of Saddam and
removed one of the Emir of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Bolivian Indians March into La Paz to Protest Deforestation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 800 Indians marched into the
capital Monday, ending a 470-mile trek to draw attention to their
anguish over the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest where they
reside.
   The Indians were greeted by tens of thousands of city residents
who poured into the streets of La Paz to greet them.
   The Indians, including women and children, made the 32-day trek
from the jungle lowlands to La Paz to demand the return of 750,000
acres of land deeded to lumber companies. La Paz is 13,000 feet
above sea level.
   At a 14,500 foot-high crossing 25 miles outside La Paz, Aymara
Indians from the highlands met the marchers and sacrificed a llama
to the Aymara earth goddess in a ceremony dating to pre-Colombian
times.
   Aymara leaders gave the marchers a symbolic key to La Paz and
accompanied the rainforest Indians on the last stretch of their
march.
   The march, which involves various small Indian tribes, has
captured the attention of Bolivians by exposing the misery of the
oft-neglected tribes from the isolated lowlands of interior
Bolivia.
   ``The march is not against anybody but a call for Bolivians to
pay attention to their plight,'' President Jaime Paz Zamora said
during a meeting with the Indians last week as they began their
march toward La Paz.
   Residents along the way have provided marchers with food and
lodging. Support groups from La Paz assisted with emergency medical
care. Doctors said at least 100 of the Indians were suffering from
high-altitude sickness.
   The Indian groups want the government to overturn contracts that
granted the huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Amazon and La
Plata River basins to six lumber companies.
   The contracts were signed under the conservative administration
of Victor Paz Estenssoro, who turned over the presidency to Paz
Zamora, his nephew, after elections in May 1989.
   A coalition of Indian groups say the logging companies are not
replanting the mahoganies and other fine woods they cut and are
destroying the delicate ecological balance of the area.
   The government's forestry board, which advocates the interests
of logging companies, has taken out adds in local papers saying
loggers were not damaging the environment. Loggers also argue that
should the government back away from the logging contracts it would
harm foreign investment in Bolivia.
   ``Any effort to deny the contracts legally agreed upon will put
faith in the government at stake and would seriously affect the
climate of confidence that is being created in the country,'' read
one add.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Episcopal Council, meanwhile, said
Sunday: ``Investments are welcome but not at the cost of the
depredation of our natural resources and the search for endless
profits.''
   ``Indigenous people should be respected as people and as
citizens,'' the group said in a statement.
   There are at least 40 isolated Indian communities in the
Bolivian forests with a population estimated at 150,000 people. The
Indians work as nomadic hunters, fisherman or as hired hands at
cattle ranches.
   Bolivia, a poor landlocked country in South America's
midsection, has about 7 million residents. About two-thirds of the
nation is made up of tropical lowlands.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter said
Monday at his confirmation hearings that letting states outlaw
abortion might cast doubts on other privacy rights. Senators told
Souter, testifying on his 51st birthday, that his confirmation was
virtually assured.
   During a third and final day of Senate Judiciary Committee
questioning on controversial issues he would face as a justice,
Souter said he opposes a judicial ban on the death penalty.
   In a final statement to the committee, Souter said, ``You have
treated me with such consummate fairness that on whatever court I
may sit I hope I will do as well.''
   Souter was followed to the witness table by an American Bar
Association committee which previously announced that it had given
him its highest rating - ``well qualified.''
   More than two dozen other witnesses, including the woman whose
challenge to a Texas abortion law led to the Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion, were scheduled to begin testimony Tuesday.
   Souter continued to dodge questions concerning his views on
abortion but did address the privacy-rights issue and said his
personal feelings on abortion would not keep him from taking part
in Supreme Court decisions on the subject.
   ``A lot of people have the feeling that your confirmation
process is over,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told Souter at one
point.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., told the New Hampshire judge,
``I believe you will be confirmed.''
   Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, also
voiced confidence about Souter's success. But committee chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del., said some senators, including himself, remain
undecided.
   The 14-member committee will send its recommendation to the full
Senate for a confirmation vote Biden indicated might come ``in two
or three weeks.''
   Asked whether he believes the death penalty violates the
Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, Souter said,
``I think that would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion.
That is an opinion I could not join.''
   Retired Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, whom Souter
was picked by President Bush to replace, held such a view. The only
high court justice remaining who opposes capital punishment under
all circumstances is Thurgood Marshall.
   But the court now is far more closely divided on its 1973
abortion-legalizing decision, Roe vs. Wade, and Souter again Monday
turned aside questions about his personal views on that topic.
   Pressed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Souter did say his
personal beliefs would not keep him from participating in abortion
decisions on the high court.
   He also said a successful attack on Roe vs. Wade ``might call
into question prior privacy rulings.''
   The comment could be significant, suggesting that a concern for
other privacy rights might make Souter less willing to vote to
overturn the 1973 ruling. In previous testimony, Souter told the
committee he believes married women have a fundamental privacy
right to use contraceptives.
   Souter also said overturning Roe vs. Wade would make abortion
``a matter for legislative judgment'' - as individual states would
have to decide whether to outlaw or stringently regulate abortions.
   On another subject, Souter said he made a mistake by not
insisting that New Hampshire return $74,000 contributed to the
state by the owner of the Seabrook nuclear power plant for law
enforcement costs connected with anti-nuclear demonstrations.
   Questioned by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, Souter said giving
the money back to the Public Service Co. ``would have been an
appropriate position to take. I wish I had taken it.''
   He said acceptance of the contribution gave rise to the
appearance ``that justice can be deflected by this.''
   Metzenbaum also brought up the Supreme Court decision earlier
this year striking down a federal ban on burning the American flag.
The senator asked, Is the court obligated to enforce individual
rights ``no matter how unpopular the cause?''
   Souter replied: ``If that were not the case, there would be no
need to have a Bill or Rights.''
   The nominee refused several invitations by Grassley to criticize
past Supreme Court rulings that expanded the rights of criminal
suspects.
   About the landmark 1966 ruling in Miranda vs. Arizona that
required police to warn suspects of their rights before questioning
them, Souter said the ruling did not create a new right but merely
set down procedural guidelines for protecting a right.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., reminded Souter of an answer Robert H.
Bork gave during the confirmation hearings that preceded the
Senate's rejection in 1987 of Bork's Supreme Court nomination.
   Taking issue with Bork's view that adding to an individual's
rights necessarily diminishes the rights of someone else, Simon
said he believes adding to one person's rights enhances the rights
of all.
   Souter agreed with Simon, saying, ``I'd rather have a right to
do something ... than a right to stop someone else.''
   Simon replied: ``I like that answer.''
   When Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., asked Souter how he had changed
over the past 25 years, the judge said he had ``learned something
of the wisdom'' of Benjamin Franklin's advice to ``join with me in
doubting for a minute your own infallibility.''
   Simpson said, ``I like that.''

<HEAD>President Threatens To Veto Textile Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday he would veto a
bill due for a vote in the House to sharply limit imports of
textiles, apparel and shoes.
   ``The bill is a threat to the stability of the world trading
system and is completely contrary to the economic, commercial and
political interests of the United States,'' Bush said in a letter
to congressional leaders.
   ``This legislation would seriously restrict textile and footwear
imports and violate international trade rules,'' the president
added. ``It represents the worst form of economic policy for
America, one based upon the mistaken belief that less trade
throughout the world will somehow save American jobs and enhance
our prosperity.''
   The House was to vote on the measure Tuesday.
   The bill would restrict textile imports levels to a 1 percent
increase over the previous year.
   Shoe import quotas would be permanently fixed at 1980 levels and
would cover 38 product categories, applying to all countries except
Canada and Israel.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for 12 major European countries warned
that passing a bill to limit U.S. imports could bring failure to
more than four years of world-wide talks to increase trade and to
cut subsidies to farmers.
   Andreas van Agt, ambassador of the European Economic Community,
called it ``this Draconian provision.'' He wrote House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley that he wanted to explain why the 12 governments in
the community oppose the bill.
   ``Indeed, the passage of such legislation would be tantamount to
eliminating all prospects of progress in this area and, even worse,
will jeopardize negotiations not just in textiles but in all other
areas covered by the Round as well,'' he said.

<HEAD>South Africa Would Sign Nuclear Treaty, Under Conditions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Africa would sign the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty if other nations in the southern
African region also agreed to sign such a document, Foreign Affairs
Minister Pik Botha said Monday.
   He said officials have discussed the issue with the United
States, Soviet Union and Britain. Botha cited reduced tensions
between the superpowers as a reason for the willingness to join the
pact.
   ``The South African government is prepared to accede to the
treaty in the context of an equal commitment by other states in the
southern African region,'' Botha said in a statement.
   Discussions on creating a nuclear-free zone in southern Africa
had been held with neighboring countries, he said.
   ``Such a move would further remove suspicions and should
strengthen the economic and geographical cohesion of the region,''
Botha said.
   It was the latest in a series of signals that South Africa has
greater cooperation with its neighbors, among the most vocal
critics of the apartheid system of racial segregation and white
dominance.
   During the 1980s, South Africa supported rebel movements
fighting leftist governments in Mozambique and Angola. However,
South Africa has signed peace treaties with both countries and is
improving diplomatic and trade contacts with other countries
throughout Africa.
   South Africa has previously refused to sign the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. It has one nuclear power plant, near Cape
Town, and is a major uranium exporting country.
   It has refused to say if it has nuclear weapons, but is widely
believed to have the ability to make them.
   The treaty calls on countries with nuclear weapons to refrain
from selling them or the technology to other countries. Those
without nuclear weapons agree to refrain from purchasing them or
the technology to make them. More than 130 countries have signed
the treaty.

   Police confiscated
nearly 1{ tons of Colombian cocaine worth about $33 million in the
Dominican Republic's largest-ever drug seizure, officials said
Monday.
   Seventeen suspects - 10 Dominicans and seven Venezuelans - were
arrested over weekend, the Drug Control Division said in a
statement.
   The operation began in Colombia after authorities were tipped
the cocaine was aboard a Venezuelan-registered ship, Cesma II, the
officials said.
   The statement said authorities confiscated 2,930 pounds of pure
cocaine, which arrived Thursday near a beach 11 miles from the
capital, Santo Domingo.
   It said 1,959 pounds of the shipment was seized from fishing
boats that picked up the drug after it was thrown overboard in
cases. The remainder was confiscated from a house where it was
delivered Friday night.
   The Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola with Haiti, has become a major transshipment point for
Colombian cocaine destined for the U.S. market.
   The largest previous drug seizure here was in May 1987, when
authorities confiscated 2,119 pounds of cocaine aboard a ship.

<HEAD>Guatemala Goes on U.S. Drug Problem List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has placed Guatemala
on a list of major drug trafficking countries, and further U.S. aid
will be conditioned on how hard it fights the narcotics problem, a
diplomat said Monday.
   U.S. officials say at least 4,000 acres in Guatemala's rugged
western mountains were planted with opium poppies last year. The
region yields three or four 16-metric ton harvests a year - said to
be enough heroin to supply the annual needs of each addict in the
United States.
   The country is also a major transshipment point for cocaine.
Fourteen tons were seized in Guatemala this year, compared to 4
tons last year, U.S. Embassy spokesman James Dickmeyer said in an
interview.
   ``Guatemala has been overwhelmed by drugs. That's why it has
been put on the list,'' Dickmeyer said.
   Any nation that produces more than 5 tons of opium paste
automatically goes on the drug watch list, which currently includes
24 nations - 10 in Latin America and the Caribbean and 14 in Asia
and the Mideast.
   Every March, the administration gives Congress a ``scorecard''
on each country's efforts to curb drug production, trafficking or
money-laundering.
   If the administration fails to certify Guatemala is cooperating
in the war on drugs, it could lose half its U.S. aid.
   Dickmeyer said Guatemala is not likely to have problems with
certification because it is cooperating with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   ``When they pass information to Guatemala that something is
coming through, the shipment usually gets busted,'' Dickmeyer said.
   U.S. aid to Guatemala in the current fiscal year totalled $121.3
million - $118 in economic aid and $3.3 million in military aid. It
included more than $1 million earmarked primarily for a U.S.
spraying program against opium fields.
   The military, which has dominated Guatemala for decades, has not
been involved in fighting poppy cultivation, officials say. It has
left enforcement to the undermanned Treasury Police.
   Some prominent Guatemalan officials have been linked to drug
trafficking in recent years. U.S. officials say drug operations
thrive in a climate of corruption that has grown since Christian
Democrat Vinicio Cerezo became president in 1986.
   Polls indicate the Christian Democrats will lose the
presidential elections set for November.

<TEXT>
   Up to 2 million Soviet immigrants could arrive
in Israel by the end of 1995 and the government will need hundreds
of millions of dollars in extra aid to absorb them, a senior
official said Monday.
   The projection by Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, would mean an increase of nearly
45 percent in Israel's current population of 4.5 million.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday welcomed a planeload of
Soviet immigrants, praising the influx as a boost to the strength
of the Jewish state.
   ``These immigrants are more important than weapons,'' Shamir
told reporters at Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv.
   Dinitz's estimate was the highest yet for a massive influx of
Soviets that started last year. The flow of immigrants has
consistently exceeded expectations and outrun plans for housing and
employment for the new arrivals.
   ``It is a most revolutionary thing,'' Dinitz told a news
conference in his office. ``I know of no other society going
through such a massive absorption process.''
   Earlier this month, Shamir said a million Soviets were expected
within the decade.
   Dinitz suggested Shamir gave a conservative estimate out of
concern the flow could be stemmed by the crisis in the Persian Gulf
and pressures from Arab countries on the Soviets to halt the
immigration.
   ``All these fears of interference with immigration have proven
unfounded. It didn't happen. With each passing month we are seeing
an increase,'' Dinitz said. Dinitz said Israel expected the total
of Soviet newcomers to reach 1 million by the end of 1992.
   He said this meant Israel's population would grow by nearly 25
percent.
   ``We have a potential of another million over six years,''
Dinitz said. He added that the Jewish Agency was already processing
applications beyond the 1 million mark.
   The Jewish Agency oversees immigration and Jewish fund-raising
abroad.
   The pace of immigration has already risen dramatically in the
last few months, Dinitz noted. This month's total through Sept. 16
was 9,864 Soviets, Dinitz said.
   Dinitz said the pressure to handle the arrivals was so great the
government was considering receiving 3,500 Soviet immigrants over
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year holiday from Wednesday through
Saturday. This is despite rabbis' complaints about allowing travel
on holy days.
   Most Soviet Jews say they are leaving their country because of
increasing evidence of anti-Semitism and economic instability in
the Soviet Union. The flow of Jews to Israel also has been spurred
by more liberal Soviet exit policies and tighter U.S. immigration
rules.
   Dinitz said Israel had to take ``drastic, comprehensive steps''
to absorb the newcomers in an economy already troubled by
double-digit inflation and a recession.
   Officials have estimated at least $30 billion would be needed to
take in 1 million immigrants. Israel's gross national product for
1988, the last year available, was $33.5 billion. Israel has so far
budgeted only about $2.3 billion over the next three years, and
world Jewry has pledged another $740 million.
   Dinitz indicated Jewish leaders abroad were already increasing
their contributions and that a record of $650 million was received
this year, but he said more would be needed.
   Israel is already hard put to handle the immigrants. State TV
reported last week that only 8,000 of about 100,000 newcomers this
year had found jobs. Unemployment excluding the immigrants has hit
10 percent.
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon told the Cabinet on Sunday that
construction was under way for only 5,000 of 45,000 housing units
approved earlier this year, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.

   European Community nations agreed
Monday to expel Iraqi military aides and restrict the movement of
Iraq's diplomats in retaliation for raids on foreign diplomatic
compounds in Kuwait.
   Britain ousted eight members of the Iraqi Embassy and ordered
the deportation of 23 other Iraqi citizens. West Germany gave
military aides at the Iraqi Embassy in Bonn 48 hours to leave the
country.
   And Italy announced a previous expulsion order would apply to 11
employees in the Iraqi military attache's office.
   Belgium told Iraqi diplomats they could travel no farther than
18 miles from Brussels, and Italy restricted them to an area within
18 miles of Rome. West Germany limited their travel to Bonn and the
city airport, and the Dutch demanded written requests from Iraqi
officials for travel outside The Hague.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on an official visit
to Czechoslovakia, said Britain expelled the Iraqis ``in order to
support France and other countries whose residences were attacked
by Iraqi troops in Kuwait.''
   ``After the exceptionally scandalous behavior against the
diplomatic missions, something had to happen,'' Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek said.
   ``(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein has to see he is in a no-win
situation,'' he said.
   Italy's foreign minister, Gianna De Michelis, said he hoped the
European reaction would show Saddam an ``escalation (of tensions)
will not help ... but will strengthen our solidarity in enforcing
the embargo.'' The United Nations imposed an economic embargo on
Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In a final statement, the foreign ministers of the 12 Common
Market nations urged Iraq ``to realize the suicidal character of
its behavior toward the international community.''
   On Sunday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the Iraqi raids
on the French, Belgian, Dutch and Canadian embassy compounds in
Kuwait. France has since expelled 29 Iraqis.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there was support
among the foreign ministers for an air blockade of Iraq, but he
said it was important to get backing from the Security Council for
such a move.
   The officials refused, however, to set a price tag on the amount
of aid they will give to the states of Egypt, Turkey and Jordan to
help offset the economic impact of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   At an informal meeting earlier this month, the ministers
promised the three countries $2 billion through the end of 1991 to
compensate them for lost trade with Iraq. But on Monday, they put
off a formal decision on the amount of aid.
   ``The community is determined to assist these countries in the
sacrifices imposed on them by the present international crisis,''
the ministers said.
   They said they would look ``as a matter of urgency'' at a
proposal to channel $2 billion to the countries. But they asked for
updated estimates on the amount of help the countries need and the
contributions already made by community and other nations.
   Hurd, taking note of fresh pledges of military and financial
support for the U.S.-led operation in the gulf, said Europeans
``are increasingly putting our forces and our money where our mouth
is.''
   The 12 EC nations are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom, Spain and Portugal.

   A buildup of flammable hydrogen
vapor in the engine compartment Monday forced NASA to cancel a
fourth attempt at launching the space shuttle Columbia.
   NASA postponed Columbia's astronomy mission until after a
higher-priority flight of the shuttle Discovery in October.
   The leak appeared as the shuttle's huge external fuel tank was
being filled. It was detected a few minutes after supercooled
liquid hydrogen fuel began flowing into the tank at a ``fast fill''
rate of 8,400 gallons per minute - the same point where buildup
caused NASA to cancel two previous launches.
   At one point, the vapor reached levels more than triple NASA's
limit.
   The shuttle was to have been launched at 1:28 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   ``The mood is pretty depressing,'' said Keith Hudkins, chief of
the orbiter division. ``After all summer trying to chase these
leaks down ... I'll tell you this, we've had all the experts
working very long hours, and they are experts. It's just a very
difficult problem.''
   After the launch was called off, engineers scrambled to find the
cause of the problem. They monitored sensors in the engine
compartment long after the filling operation was stopped.
   Robert Crippen, director of the shuttle program, said NASA would
conduct a tanking test, on Sunday at the earliest, in an attempt to
pinpoint the source of the leak. Television cameras will be mounted
in the crowded compartment, he said.
   ``It's obviously a leak we cannot pick up,'' Crippen said.
   He said the leak appears only when the liquid hydrogen fuel is
at its coldest - minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. As it warms a few
degrees while the shuttle sits, the leak stops, Crippen said.
   Columbia is the oldest ship in the fleet. It has been flying
since 1981 and has nine missions on its flight log.
   At a briefing earlier in the day, William Lenoir, the head of
NASA's space flight program, expressed the hope the leaks had been
found and fixed. Two leaky components were replaced last week.
   ``We're going to keep trying until we get it right,'' he said.
   In past filling operations, NASA said it would stop fueling if
there were more than 600 parts of highly flammable hydrogen vapor
in a million parts of air. But on Monday, Lenoir said that the
bottom line would be raised to 1,000 parts per million. The mission
was called off on Monday when concentrations reached 3,300 ppm.
   On Sept. 5, when the last filling operation also ended in a
scrub, sensors recorded 6,500 ppm. On the attempt before that, May
29, hydrogen leaked in two places: from the large pipe that
connects the ship with its tank and in the aft compartment where
the engines are.
   The pipe was replaced, and there was no leak in that area on
Monday or during the last fueling.
   Hydrogen vapor could burst into flame if the concentration is
too high.
   Monday afternoon began badly for the launch team. The start of
the filling operation was delayed 53 minutes because of lightning
within six miles of the launch pad.
   Columbia was to have carried seven astronauts into space and the
$150 million Astro observatory.
   ``It gets a little harder each time, but the science is there
and we want to go after it,'' said mission scientist Ted Gull.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hasn't
launched a shuttle since April, when Discovery carried the flawed
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Discovery now sits on a launch
pad 1{ miles away from Columbia. Discovery is scheduled to launch
around Oct. 8, carrying a satellite to study the sun.
   Atlantis, meanwhile, is in the hangar undergoing repairs for
hydrogen leaks that were detected over the summer.
   The Astro mission originally was scheduled for March 1986, but
was delayed indefinitely following the Challenger explosion two
months earlier.
   Veteran astronaut Vance Brand is to command the mission. At 59,
he would be the oldest person to fly in space.
   The crew includes four astronomers who would have operated
Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes in non-stop shifts during the
nine- to 10-day mission. An X-ray telescope, responsible for
Columbia's second failed launch attempt, was to be managed by
computer commands sent from the ground.

   The test of any great role is in the different
ways it can be performed and still be successful.
   A fine example is now on view at Broadway's St. James Theater
where the revival of ``Gypsy'' has a new Rose, that quintessential
stage mother, in the person of Linda Lavin, last seen here three
years ago in Neil Simon's ``Broadway Bound.''
   Lavin plays Rose, the mother of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, as a
twitchy street fighter, tough, uncompromising and more than a tad
neurotic.
   It's a thoroughly original, even dangerous performance,
different from the portraits provided by the other formidable women
- Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly - who have played the
role on Broadway over the last 30 years. And it's an amazing
demonstration of what an actress, who has thought out the role from
a very specific point of view, can do.
   Lavin is willing to let the audience dislike this Rose as she
forces daughters June and then Louise into the show business
careers she never had.
   It's a credit to Lavin's harsh performance that she refuses to
soften the woman. Everything her Rose wants, she wants on her terms
only - whether it's the love of that sweet candy salesman turned
manager Herbie or a career for her awkward, also-ran daughter
Louise.
   Watch her grim determination as she prepares sweet little Louise
for her debut as a burlesque queen. The concentration is awesome as
Rose contemplates finally making her daughter a star.
   Lavin's fierceness extends to her singing. The woman knows how
to handle a theater song. Long before she was television's
``Alice,'' she had a steady career in Broadway musicals. Her
``Rose's Turn,'' is a frenzied cry for recognition for what she
did.
   What's amazing is that Lavin manages to evoke a sense of pity
for this woman, making the ending moving and a bit teary as mother
and daughter come to a sort of uneasy truce at the final curtain.
   The rest of the cast has improved in the 10 months the show has
been playing on Broadway. Jonathan Hadary remains the definitive
Herbie, putting a human face on what is often a cipher of a
character. Christen Tassin is still hilariously horrific as Baby
June, the world's most obnoxious child star. And Crista Moore has
grown immeasurably in the title role of the ugly duckling who
becomes a very sexy swan.
   The score by Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim is as brassy and
classy as ever, and Arthur Laurents' book is a model of what
musical comedy writing should be. And now there's Lavin. Mama Rose
has never been as unappealing - and as fascinating.
   ---
   ``Falsettoland,'' William Finn's musical about facing big city
life in the Age of AIDS, keeps getting better and better. In its
recent transfer to off-Broadway's Lucille Lortel Theater for an
open-ended run, the musical remains funny and poignant.
   On repeated viewings, two things stand out - the melodic
inventiveness of Finn's score and the rapid-fire staging of
director James Lapine. This is a musical that never stops. For 70
fast minutes, the story of Marvin and how he copes with his son's
bar mitzvah and his lover's fatal illness never lets down -
musically or emotionally.
   The cast, headed by the superb Michael Rupert and Stephen
Bogardus, is now even more comfortable in the show. It's odd to
think of a musical about AIDS as exhilarating and not depressing,
but ``Falsettoland'' turns the act of growing up and coming to
terms with oneself into an affecting piece of musical theater.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels Claim to Kill More Than 1,000 Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels claimed they killed or
wounded nearly 3,000 soldiers in four days of fighting that the
Ethiopian government said was causing ``enormous sacrifices'' among
its troops.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which appears this year
to have scored a breakthrough in its 29-year-old war against the
central government, said the rebels had rebuffed a government
offensive that began Sept. 9.
   The rebels said the government suffered 1,050dead and 1,900
injured in the battle near Asmara, Ethiopia's second largest city.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, said the rebels also
captured three tanks and a large cache of weapons.
   It was impossible to independently verify the rebel claims.
   Egyptian President Mengistu Haile Mariam hinted at the fighting
Wednesday in a speech marking the 1974 coup that toppled the late
Emperor Haile Selassie and brought Mengistu to power.
   Mengistu said the Eritreans were intensifying their war and
government troops were ``paying enormous sacrifices to uphold the
entity of the motherland.''
   Mengistu appealed to the rebels to resume the peace talks they
held with the government last year.
   Ethiopia's army is made up largely of forcibly recruited
youngsters. They face an experienced guerrilla force considered by
many the best in the world. The Soviet Union has halted military
aid to Ethiopia after years of support.
   The Eritreans control most of the countryside in Eritrea
province. In February, after their largest offensive ever, they
captured the Red Sea port of Massawa and cut all ground routes to
Asmara from the capital, Addis Ababa.
   The government is also fighting a smaller guerrilla group, the
Tigre People's Liberation Front, which controls Tigre province, on
the southern border with Eritrea.
   The Tigreans are seeking to oust Mengistu and establish a
government patterned after that of Albania, the last of the
hard-line Marxist states in Eastern Europe.
   Although their aims differ, the Tigreans and the Eritreans
usually conduct joint offensives.

<TEXT>
   A former leader of the 1965 military
coup who later fell out with President Suharto and became an
important dissident has been released from prison.
   More than 1,000 supporters hailed former Lt. Gen. Hartono R.
Dharsono at the gates of Cipinang Prison on his release Sunday.
   Dharsono, 64, commanded troops in Bandung when President
Suharto, then a general, took power in the 1965 coup that deposed
President Sukarno. Dharsono's troops provided Suharto with
essential support.
   Later he became ambassador to Thailand and secretary-general of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which groups Thailand,
Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.
   But Dharsono in the 1980s became associated with ``Petition
50,'' a dissident group of retired military officers, former
Cabinet ministers and human rights activists who petition for
greater democracy.
   The group last month demanded Suharto step down and allow more
democracy in the world's fifth most-populous country.
   Dharsono was by far the best-known defendant in one of more than
30 subversion trials in 1985 that grew out of a September 1984 riot
in Jakarta that left at least 30 dead.
   He was charged with signing a report that challenged the
official version of the event. Another count said he attended a
meeting where Moslem youths planned to retaliate for government
brutality during the riot.
   Dharsono was sentenced in 1986 to seven years behind bars. He
got time off for good behavior.

   Presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr.
has been denied permission to vote in the District of Columbia
where he has been confined for eight years for the 1981 shooting of
President Reagan.
   Hinckley claimed in a petition to the DC Board of Elections that
he had resided and paid taxes in the District for eight years and
should be given the right to vote in the upcoming general election.
   But after a hearing Monday, the board rejected the petition and
said a person involuntarily confined cannot change his address to
the jurisdiction where he is being held.
   Hinckley, charged with the attempted assassination of the
president, was found innocent by reason of insanity in 1982 and
since has been confined at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington
D.C.
   ``He does not have the freedom or the will to adopt the District
as his residence,'' said William Lewis, the board's general
counsel.
   Hinckley has the right to vote, but must do so by absentee
ballot in his home state, the board said. Hinckley grew up in
Colorado, but lived in various states shortly prior to his arrest.
It was not clear Monday where his legal residence would be.

   Vietnam's Communist Party chief Nguyen
Van Linh and two other Vietnamese leaders secretly visited China
this month for talks on improving relations, Thai officials and
Western diplomats said Monday.
   It is believed to have been the highest-level Vietnamese
delegation to visit Beijing since the two countries fought a border
war in 1979.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
delegation that met with Chinese Premier Li Peng included Linh,
Vietnamese Prime Minister Do Muoi and Pham Van Dong, a former prime
minister who is a senior advisor.
   In early May, Japanese officials had quoted Linh as saying he
was ready to go to China to normalize relations if the Chinese
invited him.
   In Beijing, an official of the Vietnamese Embassy on Monday
denied such a visit took place. The Chinese Foreign Ministry
refused to comment.
   A Thai government official said the two sides had met to discuss
what positions they would take at the Cambodian peace talks in
Jakarta, Indonesia.
   The talks last week produced a breakthrough agreement in which
the Cambodian factions joined to form a Supreme National Council
and accepted a U.N. Security Council plan as the basis for a
settlement. The first session of the Supreme National Council
convened Monday in Bangkok.
   Vietnam and China have decreased border attacks the past two
years. Their deputy foreign ministers have held several rounds of
talks on the war between the Vietnamese-installed government and
Chinese-backed guerrillas in Cambodia.
   China has said the Cambodian conflict must be resolved before
relations with Vietnam can be normalized.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok said Monday the two countries were
eager to get past the Cambodia issue so they could increase
economic ties and trade, which has boomed since the border was
opened two years ago.
   The Communist neighbors agree that the basis for a settlement
should be the comprehensive peace plan, adopted Aug. 28 by the U.N.
Security Council. The plan calls for heavy U.N. involvement in
Cambodia before elections.
   They appear to still disagree, however, over how much power the
government and the guerrillas should have in this interim period.

   A military court on Monday freed for
health reasons four of 23 former Politburo members on trial for
allegedly contributing to hundreds of deaths during last year's
anti-Communist revolt.
   The 165-page indictment attributes the 1,033 deaths and more
than 2,000 injuries during the December revolution that toppled
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to decisions taken by the group.
   The defendants - who face maximum sentences of life in jail in
convicted - pleaded innocent to the charges, read out Monday.
   The five-man panel of military judges then announced that four
of the 12 who had requested medical examinations will be released
from prison, but will not be allowed to leave Bucharest.
   The judges said the four would be allowed to remain free for
three months, indicating their situation would be reviewed if the
trial continued past that time.
   The four included former Premier Constantin Dascalescu,
suffering from diabetes, heart disease and spells of delirium, and
former union president Miu Dobrescu, who has nervous system
disorders.
   Th other two are Gheorghe Radulescu and Suzanna Gadea. Their
ailments were not disclosed.
   Former Vice Premier Ion Radu was freed from jail last month for
unspecified health reasons.
   The trial opened July 21, but has been postponed three times by
requests to change the makeup of the panel of judges and by medical
examinations of the accused.

<TEXT>
   Two pictures of the winery worker
accused in a homicidal rampage emerged in court Monday - one a
brutal killer who planned nine slayings and accomplished seven, the
other a heartbroken drunk fogged by ``psychotic depression.''
   The prosecutor and defense attorney presented the contrasting
views in opening statements at the murder trial of Ramon Salicido,
who has admitted killing his wife, two of their three children, his
mother-in-law, her two young daughters and a co-worker.
   ``The evidence will show that Ramon Salcido targeted nine people
for death,'' Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Peter
Bumerts said. ``He had a reason why each should die and he then set
about to kill them, and it was only happenstance that saved two of
them.''
   Salcido also faces attempted murder charges for the throat
slashing of his daughter who survived, and the shooting of a
co-worker at the Grand Cru winery in Glen Ellen, in California's
wine country 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   Neatly dressed in a gray suit, the defendant appeared to have
tears in his eyes when the slayings were described.
   Defense attorney Marteen Miller, who concedes his client
committed the killings, says Salcido should be acquitted of
first-degree murder because he was incapable of planning the
crimes.
   Miller said Salcido had been an alcoholic since the age of 18
and had consumed three grams of cocaine and three bottles of
champagne in the hours before the slayings, which he said were
committed while Salcido was in a ``psychotic depression.''
   That state was triggered by a demand for child support from
Salcido's previous wife, the prospect of losing his job and fear
that his wife, Angela, would leave him, Miller said.
   However, Bumerts said Salcido's rage began simmering a year
after his 1985 marriage when his wife told him Sofia, the daughter
she was carrying at the wedding, was not his.
   ``Though he remained with her and fathered her two subsequent
children, the anger and humiliation ... stayed with him and
surfaced later on,'' he said.
   Bumerts said Salcido wanted to kill his in-laws because they
knew he was not Sofia's father, and he wanted to kill his
co-workers because he believed they were trying to get him fired.
   Salcido was arrested near his birthplace in Mexico within a week
of the killings and confessed to authorities. His videotaped
statement will play a major role in the trial, Bumerts said.
   Salcido is charged with fatally shooting Angela, 24, at the
couple's duplex in Boyes Hot Springs and cutting the throats of
their three daughters and leaving them for dead at a county dump.
Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 22 months, died. Carmina, then 2, survived to
tell detectives, ``Daddy cut me.''
   The first witness, Timothy Smith, told of finding the girls near
the quarry where he works. He discovered Sofia and Teresa first,
then went back and spotted Carmina.
   ``I went down the embankment after her, set her on her feet and
asked where her Mommy was,'' Smith said, adding that he then
realized the little girl's throat ``had been cut from ear to ear.''
   Salcido also is accused of fatally stabbing his mother-in-law,
Marian Richards, 47, and her 12-year-old daughter, Ruth, in their
home in Cotati and killing Richards' 8-year-old daughter, Marie, by
cutting her throat.
   Salcido also is charged with fatally shooting Tracey Toovey, 35,
a co-worker at the winery.
   Other charges include attempted murder for the attack on Carmina
and for allegedly shooting co-worker Kenneth Butti and allegedly
trying to shoot Butti's wife, Terri. The Buttis are among the
prosecution's witnesses. Carmina, reportedly living with a Missouri
family, won't appear, Bumerts says.
   The trial was moved from Sonoma County to San Mateo County, near
San Francisco, because of extensive publicity.

   A gasoline tanker that exploded and
burned for more than a day before being doused Monday burst back
into flames hours after firefighters declared victory.
   ``She's engulfed there. It's the same thing as we had
yesterday,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer Patrick Higgins said late
Monday. He described the M.V. Jupiter as engulfed in flames about
nine hours after authorities thought they had doused the fire
believed to have killed one crewman.
   Firefighters weren't able to explain why the blaze reignited
aboard the vessel moored in the Saginaw River.
   They planned to wait for morning to renew the battle because it
would be too dangerous at night, Higgins said.
   Officials had pronounced fire extinguished about 1:30 p.m.
Monday. The explosions and fire that broke out Sunday morning
killed one of the ship's 18 crew members and left three
hospitalized in fair condition.
   Earlier, firefighters from Boots &amp; Coots, a Houston firm
specializing in petroleum blazes, knocked down the flames by
dousing them with water and fire-retardant foam from the decks of a
Coast Guard ship.
   Cleanup crews put sponge-like material in the water to prevent
gasoline from seeping into the river, said Clay Evans, spokesman
for the Spill Control Association of America, an industry
spill-response group.
   Evans said a small amount of gasoline leaked into the river,
which was closed to boaters Monday.
   Dave Usher, president of Marine Pollution Control in Detroit,
said Monday that a few thousand feet of absorbent padding and booms
about 10 inches thick were at the site.
   ``It's under control, but there's always a danger,'' Usher said
of a potential gasoline spill..
   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources conducted water and
air contamination tests. Thick smoke blanketed the area until the
fire was doused.
   Hundreds of dead shad, walleye and perch washed ashore as far
away as a half-mile from the tanker, said Terry Walkington, a
department spokesman.
   ``There was some fish lost, we don't know if it was the
explosion, or if it was from the heat that caused stress on the
fish,'' said Mike Moore, department deputy director.
   Preliminary water tests showed no heavy concentrations of
gasoline or oil, said David Hales, director of the natural
resources department. ``We won't be able to get a detailed analysis
until later this week,'' he said.
   Spilled gasoline was unlikely to have long-term effects on fish
because it evaporates rapidly, Walkington said.
   The tanker - owned by Cleveland Tankers Inc., a subsidiary of
Ashland Oil Inc. - was ripped by an explosion Sunday morning as it
unloaded its cargo of unleaded gasoline at Bay City's Total
Refinery Dock Facility. The first blast was followed by explosions
in each of the ship's remaining five cargo holds.
   The Jupiter had unloaded about 30,000 barrels of its
54,000-barrel cargo when the blast occurred, said Dan Lacy,
spokesman for Ashland, which is based in Ashland, Ky.
   Investigators were unsure what caused the fire. One possibility
was that the wake of a passing ship could have parted some of the
Jupiter's mooring lines and its gasoline connection, spilling fuel
that ignited and caused the blast, Lacy said.
   Ashland spokesman Tom Dalesio said a small quantity of gasoline
leaked into the river shortly after the explosion, but had
evaporated or been burned off by the intense flames.
   Damage to the Jupiter won't be assessed until the tanker cools
enough for investigators to board and inspect, possibly as early as
Tuesday, said Tom Dalesio, another Ashland spokesman.
   The missing crewman, Tom Sexton, 46, of Iowa, was believed to
have died while swim toward shore, state police spokesman Robert
Nelson said.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who stalked a street thug accused of
mugging his mother was charged with manslaughter Monday after he
allegedly tracked the thief to a drug-plagued park and stabbed him.
   
   Victor Lopez, 18, of the Bronx allegedly stabbed 25-year-old
Lazara O'Farrill three times early Saturday, police Lt. Michael
Bramble said. Maria Lopez said O'Farrill stole two gold chains and
reached into her blouse to see if she was hiding money in her
brassiere.
   ``The young man was trying to avenge his mother's mugging,''
Bramble said. ``Basically, someone took the law into their own
hands. Instead of coming to the police, they acted irrationally and
emotionally.''
   A tourist from Utah was killed earlier this month when he tried
to defend his mother from muggers on a Manhattan subway platform.
   Mrs. Lopez, 37, said she was approached by two men and mugged by
O'Farrill as she walked to the subway on her way to work.
   ``I screamed, I was nervous, I called 911, then I followed one
of them,'' she said, adding that she then called home and told her
sons Victor and Raymond, 21, what had happened.
   ``I feel guilty,'' she sobbed. ``If I hadn't called my son, this
wouldn't have happened.''
   O'Farrill was notorious in the neighborhood for strong-arm
robberies, she alleged.
   ``Mostly everybody had been mugged by him, even people in his
own building,'' Mrs. Lopez said, adding that he belonged to a gang
known as ``Los Machoteros,'' or the machete-wielders.
   ``The detectives told me that even his mother said she expected
this to happen,'' she said.
   Mrs. Lopez talked her son into surrendering after two area
teen-agers were arrested and charged with the killing. ``I believed
it wasn't right,'' she said. ``I told him there's no need to be
hiding.''
   Lopez was arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court on one manslaughter
count and one count of criminal possession of a weapon. His
remained in jail with bond set at $5,000.
   The sons found O'Farrill's alleged accomplice, who told them he
only tagged along when O'Farrill mugged their mother for money to
buy crack, police said.
   The sons spent an hour looking for O'Farrill before they found
him at drug-plagued St. Mary's Park.
   As they approached, O'Farrill swore at them and ``tried to pull
something from his waist, and that's when my son stabbed him in the
arm,'' Mrs. Lopez said.
   O'Farrill died of loss of blood from stab wounds to the chest,
arm and leg, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical
examiner.
   ``I never knew a killing would happen, all we wanted to do was
to take them to the police,'' Mrs. Lopez said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Philippine officials opened
talks Tuesday on the future of U.S. military bases, and the chief
American negotiator said the days of a large U.S. military presence
here ``are coming to an end.''
   ``What remains for us to determine is the rate at which this
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two
governments wish to pursue,'' chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Armitage told the opening session.
   U.S. and Philippine panels resumed the talks that began last May
on the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four
smaller installations.
   The lease on the bases expires in Sept. 1991, and President
Corazon Aquino says it is time to discuss the ``orderly
withdrawal'' of the 40,000 American troops, Defense Department
civilians and military dependents stationed here.
   ``It is clear to me that the days of a very large presence of
U.S. sailors and airmen in the Philippines are coming to an end,''
Armitage said in his opening remarks.
   On Monday, police clashed with hundreds of demonstrators who
demanded that the Americans go home. At least 17 people were
arrested and seven people were injured in two anti-bases rallies
outside the U.S. Embassy.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday in
Washington the Bush administration hoped any new acccord would
``include provisions for a continuing defense relationship,
including U.S. access to Philippine military facilities.''
   
   The two sides agreed during the opening round in May to continue
talks on a new U.S.-Philippine security agreement.
   Opposition to the bases is growing among Filipinos who consider
them an infringement on national sovereignty.
   On the eve of the talks, Mrs. Aquino said in a nationally
televised address that the negotiations will redefine relations
between the United States and this former American colony.
   ``It is now necessary for our government to work with the United
States for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their
forces from our country,'' she said.
   Last Friday, The Washington Post reported that U.S. negotiators
will offer to close the bases over 10 years.
   Manila newspapers reported last month that the Philippines will
propose that Clark Air Base and other facilities be closed next
year in return for allowing the Americans to keep Subic for 10
years.
   U.S. officials said the 40,000 American troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents will remain as long as
they are wanted.
   The installations are among the largest American bases on
foreign soil.
   ``In a world where the Cold War has ended, and events in Eastern
Europe and the Middle East have altered the traditional
geopolitical order, the decades-old parameters of the
(Philippine-U.S.) relationship no longer hold,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``The old cannot continue; the new must now be born,'' she
added. ``This new relationship shall be the subject of the talks
that begin tomorrow.''
   Rafael Alunan, the spokesman of the Philippine panel, said
Manila wanted the talks ``to restructure our relations to cover a
broad range of concerns.''
   ``For us, there is more to life than security matters, and that
is what we have to impress upon them,'' Alunan said.
   Mrs. Aquino also noted that a government panel is working on
plans to convert the bases into civlian use. The panel is expected
to finish its report next month.
   Any new agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the facilities is
strong.
   U.S. troops have been restricted to their bases to prevent
attacks by Communist rebels. In May, two American airmen were
killed outside Clark on the eve of the first round of talks.
   Early Monday, about 350 protesters marched to the U.S. Embassy
but were driven away by police after some in the crowd hurled small
bombs. A judge and two policemen were injured and three
demonstrators were arrested.
   Later, about 1,000 protesters returned, but police again blocked
their march about 200 yards from the embassy. At least 14 more were
arrested and at least three demonstrators and a policeman were
hospitalized for blast wounds.
   Col. Ricardo Reyes, Manila police operations chief, said the
demonstrators provoked the second clash when they tried to break
the police line.

   One lucky player trembled so much when
she heard she won a share of a $106.5 million Lotto jackpot that
she dropped her ticket. Another ran outside in her bathrobe,
screaming ``We're rich! We're rich!''
   Two winning ticket holders in the nation's second-richest
lottery drawing came forward Monday. Both planned to share the
wealth with family members - one group having gone so far as to
create a legal partnership in case they won.
   Six winning tickets were sold for $1 each. Each is now worth
$887,500 a year, before taxes, for 20 years.
   Kathy Smith of Longwood said when she realized Sunday morning
she had a ticket with all six numbers, ``I shook so bad I dropped
the ticket.'' She said she picked the winning numbers -
5-6-21-34-35-45 - at random.
   She will get one-fourth of the $17.75 million individual
winner's share, with her brother and mother receiving equal cuts
and seven others splitting the final 25 percent.
   Her brother, Scott, a Tampa accountant, came up with the
partnership idea and he and the others - mainly relatives - entered
into the formal agreement last week. Together the group bought 50
tickets.
   The other winner to come forward was Richard J. Piasecki, a
retired auto worker originally from Kenosha, Wis.
   ``We told our landlady and then she wanted to feel it and she
started rubbing it and I grabbed it out of her hands,'' Piasecki
said laughing. ``She said she wanted to rub it for luck.''
   He said he's sharing his cut with his two children. His
daughter, Mary Jo Bednarski, met her husband with the news by
running into the driveway of their Wisconsin home in her bathrobe
yelling ``We're rich! We're rich!''
   Mrs. Bednarski, who has four children, said she'll quit her job
at a Hardee's restaurant.
   ``This is my notice,'' she said at a news conference, adding the
family was considering moving to Florida.
   The families said they weren't disappointed with the cut of the
near-record jackpot. Pennsylvania posted the record in April 1989
with a $115 million jackpot.
   ``Who needs $106 million?'' asked Pat Landry, Ms. Smith's
mother.
   Mrs. Landry, 54, of Sorrento said she'd quit her job at Seminole
Community College, but planned no big spending sprees.
   ``I don't want my life to change,'' she said. ``I'm quite
pleased with my life, very pleased with my life. Don't get me
wrong. I wouldn't turn this down but I mean, this is frosting on
the cake.''
   Ms. Smith, 34, said she wouldn't quit her nursing job because
she loved her work, but planned to buy a car and some land for
horses.
   Her 35-year-old brother said he would continue to work, adding
he'd ``prudently invest ... maybe buy a few things.''
   Piasecki and his wife, Jeanne, of New Smyrna Beach, will divide
their money into thirds to share with their two children.
   Piasecki took early retirement after working 32 years as a body
repairman when 5,300 Chrysler employees were laid off by a plant
closing in Dec. 1988. The couple, who have lived in a rented mobile
home since moving to New Smyrna Beach last year, plan to buy a
small home with a little land.
   The holders of the four other winning tickets have 180 days to
claim their prizes. The tickets were sold in Miami, Winter Haven,
Coconut Creek and Venice.
   Piasecki said he ``almost died'' after going through his 30
tickets right after Saturday night's drawing.
   A few minutes later he called his daughter.
   ``He yelled `We're millionaires!'' Mrs. Bednarski said. ``And I
said `This is sick.' I thought he was playing a joke. My brother
got on the phone and started yelling `It's true, it's true!'''
   Her brother, Richard Piasecki of New Smyrna Beach, also plans to
quit his job as a print pressman.
   The elder Piasecki retired from Chrysler Corp. in 1988 after 32
years as a body repairman. He and his wife, who moved to New Smyrna
Beach last year and live in a rented mobile home, plan to buy a
small home with a little land.
   The couple, who own a motor home, also plan to buy a bigger
motor home and a boat. Mrs. Piasecki said the couple will travel.
   Mrs. Piasecki said winning made her eat her words.
   ``I don't believe in gambling,'' she said, adding that she
``fussed at my husband every time he bought some tickets.''

<HEAD>AP Board Approves 3.9 Percent Rate Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Associated Press
has approved a general assessment increase of 3.9 percent for its
1,538 daily and weekly newspaper members and 5,800 broadcast
members, effective Jan. 20, 1991.
   William J. Keating, chairman of the AP board of directors and
chairman and publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer, said the
assessment increase, in percentage terms, was the lowest in three
years.
   ``Mindful of the difficult times that confront much of the
industry at this stage, the board approved a rate increase that is
well below the projected inflation rate for 1990 and 1991,''
Keating said.
   The 3.9 percent increase will not cover all of the increases and
new costs faced by AP. AP will continue to meet the growing demands
of the news industry through a vigorous cost control effort and by
increasing non-traditional revenue sources, Keating said.
   Non-traditional sources now make up 24 percent of AP's revenue.
Eleven years ago that figure was 7 percent.
   ``Of the new money that AP needs to fund 1991 operations and
continue to improve services, only 31 cents of every dollar will
come from the assessment increase,'' Keating said.
   ``It is vital to all of us that our cooperative remain strong
and able to meet the challenges in news coverage and technology,''
Keating said. ``Even as some members reduce their own activity to
absorb the impact of a difficult year in the industry, demands on
the AP grow as we look to AP to do things that, in a healthier
time, we might not have relied on AP to do.''
   The general assessment increase will be combined with another
step in the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for
those members that have not reached their appropriate assessment
level. The 1991 assessment also will reflect any circulation
changes at the member newspaper.
   The assessment increase applies to all basic services for both
newspapers and broadcasters and to all supplemental services except
for the rates for financial market tables, which are being adjusted
downward in two steps in 1990 and 1991 to reflect savings achieved
in producing computer-generated stock lists.
   AP members will receive their new weekly assessment figures by
early October, Keating said.

<HEAD>New York Post Faces Live-or-Die Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News and advertising employees at the New York
Post were to vote the evening of Sept. 17 on whether the nation'
oldest daily would live or die.
   Owner Peter Kalikow said if members of the Newspaper Guild did
not agree to a four-day week - meaning a loss of one day's pay - he
would close immediately, putting 960 people out of work. The
505,000-circulation paper is losing $27 million a year.
   On Sept. 14, unions at the paper agreed to $19 million in
concessions. Guild negotiators rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but
the guild president endorsed it and decided to let the members
decide.
   The union's 352 editorial and advertising workers were voting on
whether to accept a 20 percent pay cut and the elimination of 43
jobs.
   Punctuated by a big question mark and a picture of the presses,
the front page headline Sept. 17 was possibly the 189-year-old
newspaper's last: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN AGAIN?''
   In a story inside, Editor Jerry Nachman was asked how he would
feel if the Post folded. ``How did the captain of the Titanic
feel?'' he asked.
   ``I think we will get through this tonight because the
alternative is unthinkable,'' Nachman said.
   A 23{-year composing room veteran, who declined to give his name
as he arrived at work, said: ``It's more than a job. It's part of
your life. It's part of the life of the city.''
   If the Post lives, workers will get 20 percent of company stock
and a representative on the board of directors, union leaders said.
   Kalikow bought the money-losing tabloid from Rupert Murdoch two
years ago after wringing $24 million in concesssions from the
unions.

<HEAD>Reuters Employees Authorize Strike; No Deadline Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. employees of the Reuters news agency
authorized their union leadership to call a strike against the
company, the Newspaper Guild of New York said.
   Guild members voted by a larger than 20-1 margin for the
authorization after contract talks that began nearly a year ago
failed to result in an agreement. The Guild represents nearly 500
employees, including 150 journalists.
   In a Sept. 10 news release, the Guild blamed the failing talks
on ``Reuters' demands that it substantially raise the cost to
employees for their health insurance'' while cutting maternity
benefits and severance pay.
   Andrew Nibley, Reuters' editor responsible for North America and
Latin America, refused to discuss details of the negotiations while
they are in progress.
   ``I would say that all major U.S. corporations are dealing with
the whole issue of spiraling health care costs and how they can be
contained. We think that our salaries are quite competitive and
among the best in the industry,'' he said.
   ``I don't think a strike would be in anyone's interest and I
certainly hope it doesn't come to that,'' he added.
   The Guild represents journalists, technicians, computer
operators, sales support staff, customer service and clerical
employees. The last contract expired in February.
   Salaries at Reuters range from $680.75 to $840.75 a week for
reporters. Correspondents can make up to $996.32, and salaries for
technicians range from $694.51 to $727.51.

<HEAD>UPI Closing Bureaus in Five States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International is closing bureaus
in five states as part of a general staff realignment.
   Spokesman Milt Capps confirmed a report in The Albuquerque
(N.M.) Tribune that bureaus in New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana
would be closed. He declined to say how many layoffs were involved.
   Capps also said UPI had given notice to staffers in one-person
bureaus in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Bismarck, N.D.
   He said the news service was expanding its stringer networks in
the affected states ``and working on a number of joint ventures
with people in the regions for additional coverage.''
   UPI is ``taking quite a few steps this summer and fall to
realign our staffing in the wake of our creation of a number of new
autonomous editorial units,'' he said. ``The upshot is that
virtually every bureau in the system worldwide is affected either
by increases or decreases.''
   Capps declined to discuss whether any future closures are
planned or how many bureaus UPI now operates in the United States.
Last month he confirmed a Washington Post report that 31 UPI
reporters and editors were being laid off.
   Capps said there will be net increases in staffing in such areas
as sports, business and finance and emphasis on UPI's joint
ventures with cable TV's Financial News Network, States News
Service and Financial World Magazine.
   ``We are developing what we think is a new role for UPI after 83
years which entails not only strong general news service but
increased emphasis on focused news reports that can command a
premium in the marketplace, including media and corporate
subscribers,'' he said.
   ``The bottom line is we can now say we have more people writing
for UPI across the board than a year ago,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Approves Distribution of Book on Israeli Spy Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court lifted a ban on publication of
a book about Israel's secret service, reversing a judge's order to
halt distribution at the request of Israel.
   Israel's claim that the book endangers its intelligence agents
``has not been sufficiently supported,'' the Appellate Division of
New York Supreme Court ruled unanimously Sept. 13.
   The day before, Judge Michael Dontzin had issued a temporary
restraining order barring St. Martin's Press from distributing the
book, titled ``By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer.''
   The Israeli government filed a lawsuit claiming the book could
imperil agents of the spy agency, known as Mossad, by blowing their
cover.
   The book was written by Victor Ostrovsky, who says he was a
Mossad agent for four years in the 1980s. He said in the book that
Israel had detailed information about preparations for the bombing
that killed 241 Marines in Lebanon in 1983 but gave the United
States only a vague warning so that U.S.-Arab relations would be
damaged.
   The publisher said it would start sending the book to bookstores
again.
   ``We think it's a victory for a free press and we are going to
sell the book again,'' said Roy Gainsburg, president of St.
Martin's. ``Orders have increased dramatically, which is what
always happens when you try to stop a book.''

<HEAD>Florida To Start Collecting Newspaper Sales Tax Dec. 9</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida will begin collecting sales tax
on newspapers Dec. 9 following a state Supreme Court ruling that
ended an exemption.
   The 6 percent state tax plus any local option taxes will be
collected on sales and subscriptions and will raise $25.7 million a
year, Tom Herndon, director of the Department of Revenue, said
Sept. 13.
   The Supreme Court on May 31 rejected an attempt by magazine
publishers to obtain the same exemption that was enjoyed by
newspapers. The court then went a step further and voided the
exemption entirely.
   A services tax that was enacted in 1987 included both magazines
and newspapers, but when the services tax was repealed the sales
tax was extended only to magazines.
   The justices ruled the imbalance was an encroachment on the
First Amendment's freedom of the press protections.

<HEAD>Desert Deployment Spawns Two Newspapers; Radios for the Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military is handing out
radios and more newspapers to GIs hungry for news, but it's not
printing or broadcasting anything the strictly Moslem government
could deem religious or racy.
   In the early weeks of the deployment, troops often asked
visitors to send copies of local newspapers, saying they knew
little about their mission or the situation back home.
   Operation Desert Shield since has spawned two newspapers, the
Desert Defender and the Desert Dragon, as well as several more
informal newsletters.
   The military distributed portable radios by the dozens at base
camps last week, so the troops can hear Armed Forces radio and
local English-language broadcasts.
   The radios were distributed after the military made sure that
none of the broadcasts include religious programming or gospel
music.
   ``We are being very sensitive to the culture of the host
country,'' Army Col. Rick Kiernan said. ``We want to get the troops
music, information and sports programming but we also want to be
good guests.''
   A transmitter was recently installed in Saudi Arabia to relay
the radio, and Armed Force television also is available in some
areas where U.S. troops are housed in military housing or hotels.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Former Race Promoters $13.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Plain Dealer lost a $13.6 million libel
suit to former promoters of the Budweiser Cleveland Grand Prix, who
said they were defamed by stories in the newspaper in 1984-86.
   The plaintiffs had asked for $16 million in damages. Publisher
Alex Machaskee said the newspaper will appeal the Sept. 14 verdict.
   C.K. Newcomb and Associates, along with Charles K. Newcomb and
James H. Foster, promoted the event starting with the first race,
in 1982.
   A week before the 1984 race the newspaper published a story
saying Newcomb and Foster paid themselves nearly $1 million from
race proceeds in violation of a lease they had with the city.
   The articles also said the race did not satisfy rent payments to
the city because Newcomb and Foster told the city the race was
deeply in debt.
   Lawyers for The Plain Dealer argued during the eight-week trial
that the primary points of the articles were true.
   The plaintiffs argued that the race in fact lost money its first
two years and that the articles were false.
   Newcomb and Foster sold the rights to the race in March 1985 to
businessman and former race car driver Roger Penske, and The Plain
Dealer later became co-sponsor of the event.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Trademark Infringement Suit by Pop Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed a trademark
infringement action brought by New Kids On The Block, a pop group
that sued USA Today and Star magazine for using their name in
telephone surveys.
   U.S. District Judge William J. Rea ruled Sept. 10 that the use
of 900 toll numbers to gauge popularity of the group was a news
gathering activity and therefore protected by the First Amendment.
   USA Today asked readers who their favorite New Kid was and Star
asked readers who they thought was the sexiest New Kid. Each phone
vote had a fee.
   The New Kids' lawyer, Philip Heller, said he would appeal.
   ``While we recognize the importance of the First Amendment, we
disagree with Judge Rea's application of it in this case,'' Heller
said.
   Heller said 900 numbers are commercial services. ``And the First
Amendment does not protect the use of another's trademark and
likeness to further commercial ventures, even if a newspaper is
involved,'' he said.
   He said the 900 polls competed with the group's own 900 hotline
by using pictures of the singing group and their name.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts No-Notes Rule for Reporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge decided to allow reporters to take
notes in his courtroom, prompting Philadelphia's two daily
newspapers to drop a legal challenge.
   Common Pleas Court Judge Eugene E.J. Maier signed an order Sept.
11 lifting the prohibition. He earlier had said he felt note-taking
could distract a jury and undercut the official record of a court
proceeding.
   ``After I had given further thought to it, I don't think it
offends me, and we shouldn't keep on with it as long as we could
control the matter in another way,'' Maier said.
   He said he might ask reporters to sit in a part of the courtroom
where jurors cannot see them.
   Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., publisher of The Philadelphia
Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News, dropped its appeal of the
ban, which had been pending in state Superior Court.
   The case arose when Daily News reporter Joseph P. Blake was
ordered by a court officer last month to stop taking notes during a
murder trial. Two Inquirer reporters on separate days also were
prevented from taking notes.
   ``There has been a gut feeling that note taking should not be
permitted,'' the judge told an attorney for the newspapers,
according to a transcript of an Aug. 20 meeting in his chambers.
   ``It may set up a method by which the official transcript can be
tested or can be impeached, should we say, or at least
contradicted,'' Maier said.
   A jury could be swayed ``to give greater attention to some
testimony rather than other testimony,'' because a person took
notes, he said.
   The newspapers said in their appeal the rule violated federal
and state constitutional rights of reporters to cover criminal
trials ``as surrogates for the public.''
   After lifting his ban, the judge said he would continue to
prohibit note-taking by members of the public who are not media
representatives and would reserve the right to ban note-taking by
reporters.
   ``A judge is like the captain of a ship,'' he said. ``The judge
has to control the courtroom. The worst thing that can happen is
that you don't have that control.''

   The Boston Globe decided not to endorse any
contender for statewide office in the Sept. 18 primary election,
announcing in an editorial that ``the resource of leadership is
severely depleted.''
   The Sept. 13 editorial said that Massachusetts faces political
and economic perils and that there had been ``politics-as-usual
bombast'' among the candidates.
   The Globe criticized both Republican gubernatorial candidates
for taking ``irresponsible'' positions by supporting a November
ballot question that would sharply roll back state taxes and fees.
   On the Democratic side, the editorial said, ``John Silber seemed
on paper to be an ideal profile for voters yearning for a new
era.''
   ``Campaigns, however, are waged not on paper but on
personality,'' the Globe said. ``If voters were judging Silber on a
report card, his mark on `Works well with others' would not be
high.''
   Francis X. Bellotti, a former attorney general, offers
associations with the era of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the newspaper
said.

<HEAD>Columbus Dispatch Seeks Ruling on Gag Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for The Columbus Dispatch asked
the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a gag order issued in a juvenile
court custody case and upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court.
   ``Without guidance from this Court, state courts have developed
conflicting approaches to the Constitution's role in ensuring
public access to juvenile court,'' said the writ filed Sept. 11 on
behalf of Dispatch Printing Co., which publishes the Dispatch.
   The writ said judges should have to consider First Amendment
issues along with other evidence when they issue a gag order or
close a custody case to the public.
   Judge Ronald Solove of Franklin County Juvenile Court issued gag
and closure orders last year in a three-way custody fight by two
would-be adoptive parents and the surrogate mother of Tessa Reams,
now 5.
   An appeals court reversed Solove's order but the Ohio Supreme
Court then upheld the order. The high court said juvenile
proceedings are not presumed to be open and can be closed whenever
a judge determines the psychological harm the publicity might cause
the child outweighs the public's interest in the case. The court
said First Amendment rights did not have to be considered.
   Solove has since reversed his decision, but the Ohio Supreme
Court ruling still stands.
   The Dispatch's lawyers argued in court papers that the state
Supreme Court's ruling ``missed the mark'' by relying on
``out-of-context snippets from unrelated decisions.''
   They also said the state court ``misconceived the nature'' of
the First Amendment.

<HEAD>Indiana Appeals Court Rules Records Open to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indianapolis Convention and Visitors
Association must open its financial records because it receives
substantial public financing, the Indiana Court of Appeals said.
   The Sept. 11 decision upheld a county court ruling in favor of
The Indianapolis News and its parent company, Indianapolis
Newspapers Inc.
   The convention bureau had argued it wasn't a public agency
subject to the state's Public Records Act. It said forcing it to
open its records ``will have far-reaching negative consequences''
for similarly situated groups that do business with government.
   But the appeals panel concluded the public has a right to know
how its money is being spent by such organizations.
   ``ICVA receives approximately 70 percent of its revenue from
public funds. Therefore, the Legislature has entitled the public to
review the expenditure of those funds,'' Appeals Judge Linda Chezem
wrote.
   ``Clearly, the Legislature intended the public to have the right
to investigate whether its tax money was properly spent.''
   According to court records, the association is a group of about
600 members interested in promoting and advertising Indianapolis as
a site for conventions, cultural and sports events, trade shows and
tourist visits.

<HEAD>Alternative Baptist News Agency Formed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident Southern Baptists have formed
an alternative to the group's news agency that will be run in part
by a Gannett executive, a communications professor and the news
editor of People magazine.
   Leaders of the new Associated Baptist Press began organizing the
news agency Sept. 11.
   The move is in response to the firing this summer of the two top
editors of the Baptist Press, the denomination's longtime news
agency.
   The firings came during a closed meeting of the Southern Baptist
Convention's Executive Committee and further fueled a debate over
freedom of speech and access to information within the nation's
largest Protestant denomination.
   Conservative Baptists accused the fired editors, Al Shackleford
and Dan Martin, of being biased toward the moderates in their
reporting.
   Moderate Baptists, on the other hand, believe Baptist Press now
will become a closely controlled public relations agency for the
conservative-dominated Southern Baptist Convention.
   ``I think the free flow of information goes to the bedrock
belief of the Baptist faith,'' said Charles Overby, president of
the Gannett Publishing Foundation in Washington.
   Overby, a Southern Baptist layman who is a member of the
15-member board of the new agency, said Baptists have a tradition
of free speech.
   ``That is how Baptists came to be, so the ABP is rooted in the
history of Baptists, and I believe that the work of this
organization will be consistent with the needs of Baptist people to
stay informed,'' he said.
   Shackleford is also a member of the board of the new ABP.
   Other board members include Carl L. Kell, professor of
communication and broadcasting at Western Kentucky University; Hal
Wingo, news editor of People magazine; Raymond McDaniel, retired
editor of The Shreveport (La.) Times; and Catherine Allen of
Samford University in Alabama.
   Bob Terry, editor of the Missouri state Baptist newspaper,
presided over the meeting and warned that the new organization
should not be identified as a ``moderate Baptist'' news agency.
Rather, he hopes it will be regarded as an uncensored source of
information for Southern Baptists.
   Matters of financing and personnel are yet to be worked out, but
leaders hope the new press can start functioning this fall.

<HEAD>PBS To Provide TV Show Listings Through For-Profit Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of the Public Broadcasting Service
and another company said Sept. 11 they would launch a nationwide
system to transmit television show listings to viewers' homes to
help set videocassette recorders.
   The system would send the TV listings in the ``vertical blanking
interval,'' the empty space in a television signal that is seen as
a black bar when a TV picture rolls.
   The system from PBS National Datacast, a for-profit PBS
subsidiary, and InSight Telecast would provide subscribers with
detailed on-screen TV show schedule information that could be used
to set a VCR through the use of a special device, the companies
said.
   The system is expected to be available in early 1992, the
companies said.
   National Datacast says it has been using the vertical blanking
interval to send information, such as stock quotes and credit card
verification data, since 1984.
   InSight is a provider of TV listings.

<HEAD>Fremont County Newspaper Ceases Publication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANON CITY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weekly Fremont Observer, started
three years ago by several people associated with a tax protest
group, will close because of lawsuits, Publisher Grover K.
Wilkerson said.
   ``We don't have any choice,'' Wilkerson said. ``It's costing too
much money in lawsuits. We can't afford supplies, we can't afford
to print and people won't deal with us because of the lawsuits.''
   The newspaper targeted public officials in articles penned my
nameless writers or those using pseudonyms such as ``Pauline
Fearless.''
   Wilkerson said the last edition was printed Aug. 28. At one time
the paper's circulation reached 1,400 and it employed 12 people.
Four people lost jobs when the paper folded.
   Wilkerson said the paper had been hit with ``four to five
lawsuits'' within the last year. Two of those were filed by former
District Judge Paul Keohane and former Canon City Administrator
Errol Snider.
   ``They were all public officials,'' said Wilkerson. ``Anytime
you challenge government, they put these slap suits on you. . . .
We're just a controversial newspaper and they can't stand that.''
   Keohane, who says he was voted out of office because of a
cartoon and articles printed in the Observer, said the closure of
the paper would not affect his lawsuit, set for trial in July 1991.
   ``I suspected this would happen,'' said Keohane, who now
practices law in Canon City. ``I'd say this is probably good for
the community. I'm glad to hear it.''
   Keohane filed the suit a year ago claiming the Observer printed
a cartoon that insinuated he was a drug user. He also said he was
defamed by seven articles printed in October and November 1988
involving his ruling in a sexual assault case.

<HEAD>New York Officials Respond to Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins' aides are attempting to
show that a Time magazine story and poll that portrayed the city as
a declining metropolis were misleading.
   Press secretary Albert Scardino said Time had made a ``gross
misrepresentation of its own data to let New Yorkers paint a
negative view of themselves.''
   ``The fact is, the overwhelming majority are proud of their
city,'' he said. ``They came here for great opportunities and still
have them, despite the problems.''
   The magazine reported that 73 percent of 1,009 city residents
interviewed Aug. 2-5 said they thought New York was dangerous and
that 59 percent said they would move somewhere else if they could.
   But it did not report that 70 percent thought the city was
exciting or that 78 percent of the respondents described their
neighbors as friendly.
   Jennifer Hillings Epstein, a Time spokeswoman, said the article
was neither misrepresentative nor unfair.
   ``We used the news from the poll,'' she said. ``We're a news
magazine, and we used the news.''
   The poll, conducted for Time and the Cable News Network by
Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, had a margin of error of three
percentage points.

<HEAD>Gannett Television President Is First Black Augusta Member</HEAD>

   Ron Townsend, president of Gannett Television,
has become the first black member of the Augusta National Golf
Club.
   Townsend, who oversees six Gannett television stations, said
Sept. 11 that his acceptance had nothing to do with the racial
controversy that raged at last month's PGA Championship.
   Racial policies became an issue in golf after news reports that
Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham, Ala., site of the PGA
Championship, had no black members.
   Townsend said his membership in the Augusta club, site of the
annual Masters tournament, came up five or six weeks earlier in a
meeting in Washington.
   ``I had a meeting there with members of Augusta National, which
was prompted by the chairman of our company, John Curley, who
mentioned my name to some folks,'' he said.
   ``It was around the same time as Shoal Creek, but they made it
clear that it (accepting a black) had been discussed months
before,'' said Townsend. ``It's conceivable that the Shoal Creek
thing put in on the front burner, but it was not a direct result of
that.''

<HEAD>Paper, Citizens Oppose Protective Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ThermalKem Inc. wants a protective order
that would keep environmental groups from releasing any information
they get from documents or tours of the company's facilities.
   ThermalKem attorney Richard Willis said company officials asked
for the order to protect trade secrets and employee confidentiality
and to prevent a repeat of statements made by citizens after a tour
of ThermalKem's facility in 1989. After that tour, members of the
group said they became ill at the plant.
   The environmental groups and The Herald newspaper of Rock Hill
are opposing the order.
   Robert Guild, a lawyer for Citizens for Clean Air and Water of
Rock Hill and Environmentalists Inc. of Columbia, said the order
would shield broad classes of information from being released from
the facility and would reduce public access.
   The environmental groups are challenging approval of a permit
for ThermalKem's existing incinerator by South Carolina's
Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   Ron Stanley, appointed to hear an administrative appeal of
ThermalKem's permit, is considering the order, which would prohibit
the groups from discussing what they learn from subpoenaed
documents obtained as part of the hearing. It also would restrict
the groups from discussing what they see during a tour of the
company's hazardous waste incinerator in southwestern Rock Hill.
   Stanley had ordered ThermalKem to schedule the plant visit by
the end of September and complete the release of documents to the
groups by Oct. 15.
   James M. Brailsford III, attorney for The Herald, asked Stanley
to schedule a special hearing.
   He said a hearing was necessary to ``determine that the
restraint is essential and that less-restrictive alternatives would
not be effective.''

<HEAD>New Mexico Court Won't Interfere in Photo Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Sept. 12 let
stand a lower court order that the Albuquerque Journal turn over
photographic negatives of a fatal highway accident for use in a
lawsuit.
   A panel of three justices rejected without comment the
newspaper's request to nullify the order.
   The negatives are sought by Ford Motor Co. and John Barton,
whose 62-year-old wife was killed in 1985 when her car collided
with a truck near Santa Fe.
   Barton sued the automaker, alleging a defect in the car caused
the head-on crash.
   Ford issued a subpoena for the photographs and negatives in
July. The company said they are essential in determining the
liability issues in the case.
   State District Judge Art Encinias ruled Sept. 4 that the
Journal's constitutional privilege to protect its news gathering
did not outweigh the need for the pictures. He ordered the
negatives turned over within 10 days.
   The Journal argued it had a First Amendment privilege to
withhold the unpublished photographs and protect its right to
freely gather news.
   Jim Dines, a lawyer for the Journal, told the justices in a
hearing Sept. 12 that the issue was ``a very important
constitutional matter that involves the freedom of the press.''
   Dines said he had reviewed 10 court cases from various states on
similar issues and that in seven of them photographs were found to
be ``qualifiedly privileged'' and were not required to be turned
over.
   He also argued that the 46 negatives were not necessary to
determine the precise location of the scene of the Nov. 12, 1985,
accident, because that information was available elsewhere.
   Charles Peifer, an attorney for Ford, which teamed with Barton
to obtain the photos, said the litigants wanted to determine the
position of the vehicles relative to one another and whether debris
at the site had come off the vehicles before the accident or as a
result of impact.
   That information cannot be obtained from the picture the Journal
published, which the newspaper provided to the litigants, or from
any other sources, Peifer said.

<HEAD>Illinois Newspaper Ends `Doe Watch'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEKIN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police eliminated the Doe Gang without firing
a single shot.
   For 17 days, the Pekin Daily Times blamed nearly every crime in
this Illinois River city on John, Jane and assorted other Does to
protest the police department's refusal to identify people
arrested.
   Police agreed to reveal the names and the newspaper's Doe Watch
has come to an end.
   ``The Doe family was a ficticious creation of the police as a
way to shield the names of people arrested each day,'' said Kent R.
Davy, the Times' managing editor.
   Police Chief Jack Leuck scrapped the secrecy policy Sept. 4,
allowing the Times to print the names of everyone arrested daily
after city lawyers advised him the department might be violating
state law.
   Leuck, a retired FBI agent, said he took over a year ago and was
told the policy had been in effect at least 15 years. He said the
police changed suspects' names to Doe to protect anyone who was not
formally charged.
   ``Sometimes we pick someone up and the victim decides not to
press charges,'' he said. ``People change their story or make
things up and we end up releasing the individual who was arrested.
If that arrest is reported, it can cause an individual irreparable
harm.''
   Davy, a lawyer and former assistant prosecutor in Guam, sees it
differently. He said abuses could occur if police arrest records
are kept secret in the city of 34,000 people, near Peoria in
central Illinois.
   ``People ought not be whisked away and jailed without the public
knowing,'' Davy said in an editorial. ``People of position and
influence ought not to be able to avoid prosecution after an arrest
without everyone knowing.''

<HEAD>Iraq Censors CNN Report, Rivals Say It Happens to Them, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi officials censored a CNN report Sept. 12
in which a woman who had been trapped in Kuwait said Iraqis killed
people simply because they had pictures of the country's deposed
emir.
   As in previous cases, the report was censored by fast-forwarding
past the woman's comments during the report's satellite
transmission from Baghdad, making her words unintelligible, a Cable
News Network spokesman said.
   However, correspondent Tom Mintier, who filed CNN's report from
Baghdad, called a colleague in Jordan with his recollection of the
woman's comments, which was relayed to CNN in Atlanta for a later
broadcast, CNN said.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was on a London-bound
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in
Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of that country, CNN spokesman
Steve Haworth said.
   In an interview during the flight's stopover in Baghdad, she
said that ``they (Iraqis) are killing them for having pictures of
the emir and paper flags the kids have for school. They are killing
them for this. It's getting really bad.''
   The woman apparently referred to Kuwaitis and paper Kuwaiti
flags.
   Iraqi censorship of U.S. network reports, occurring even as
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein continues to try to portray himself
positively on television, is neither unusual nor yet excessive,
network officials say.
   ``It's a common experience among all the networks,'' said Ed
Turner, CNN's executive vice president for news gathering.
   Turner said another network's shot of baking pita bread was
censored and yet another ``had a sound bite from Saddam himself,
and that was fast-forwarded.''
   CNN has been censored about six times, which is ``not so many as
to be onerous, but it is annoying,'' Turner said.
   Each time, including Sept. 12, CNN showed the full report as it
was received from Baghdad, but noted which parts were censored.
   David Miller, foreign editor for NBC News, said three taped NBC
reports, all about hostages, had been censored during satellite
transmission. The correspondent's words were not altered, but the
picture was blurred, he said.
   Each time, the ``NBC Nightly News,'' aired the full report.
   Iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages, said
CBS foreign editor Al Ortiz. But the censorship has not been so
severe ``that we haven't been able to . . . still manage to get the
story reported,'' he said.
   Miller said there were no advance warnings from Iraqi officials
and they seemed to have no rules.
   ``I don't think they have guidelines . . . there's no set of
rules the way the U.S. military (in Saudi Arabia) does it.''

<HEAD>NAB To Send Radios to Persian Gulf Troops</HEAD>

   The National Association of Broadcasters announced
a campaign to send radio receivers and batteries to American

   The campaign, called ``AIR-LIFT,'' will purchase radios and

   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.'s Group W Radio division will lead

possibly can, with a target of 25,000 receivers with batteries,''
said Lynn Christian, a senior vice president for the association.
``We think radio can play a very important role keeping our

<HEAD>Limited Televising of Federal Court Proceedings Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans, accustomed to watching presidents
and members of Congress on television, will get their first
televised look at federal judges at work next year.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for the federal
courts, approved a limited plan Sept. 12 that will permit TV
cameras to record civil trials in a handful of federal courtrooms.
   The three-year experiment will begin in July, limited to two
federal appeals courts and six trial courts. Judges who volunteer
their courtrooms for the plan will have almost total control over
what the public sees.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., who has been urging approval
of the experiment, hailed the move as a step toward promoting
public understanding of the court system.
   ``The time for federal courts to permit TV news coverage in
courtrooms has come,'' said Kastenmeier, chairman of a House
subcommittee on courts. ``Technology that permits us access to
world events also compels us to use that access to make our own
government available to our citizens.''
   Kastenmeier said televised congressional proceedings, which
began in the House in 1979 and in the Senate in 1986, have been
beneficial to the public.
   C-Span, the cable network that telecasts public affairs
programs, also welcomed the experiment.
   Forty-five states have approved the use of television cameras in
their courts, and supporters say there have been no adverse
results.
   The action does not mean federal criminal trials will be
televised. The Judicial Conference left intact a rule banning
cameras in criminal cases.
   Nor will Supreme Court proceedings be televised anytime soon.
The Judicial Conference has no control over the high court, and
most justices are believed to oppose cameras there.

<HEAD>Market for Business News Radio Seen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two business-oriented radio stations that
began operating in Virginia this spring already are up for sale.
But that's not worrying the manager of Richmond's WRBN-AM, a third
newcomer to the business radio market.
   Despite the troubles of his counterparts in Roanoke and Hampton
Roads, Jon C. King said there is an increasing appetite for
business news in the right area. As vice president and general
manager of WRBN, King has overseen operations at the Richmond
station since it began broadcasting June 14.
   ``The diversified marketplace that we have here has confirmed to
us since we've been on the air that there is a significant appetite
for what we're doing,'' he said. ``We expected that people would
find our format interesting at times during the day, but we're
finding that people are tuning in longer.''
   King said Arbitron surveys show WRBN is increasing its market
share. The two other stations in the format have lost listeners.
   WBNI-AM radio, which billed itself as Roanoke's only business
news station, suspended operations last month after less than five
months on the air.
   Another business station, WXIR-FM in Hampton Roads, began
operations April 13. Officer manager Lisa Barnes said she was
notified in July that the station was being sold.
   All three Virginia stations carried broadcasting from the
Colorado-based Business Radio Network, but WRBN expanded the
national and international programming to include local business
news.
   King's station also features travel news, stock market updates
and a varity of talk shows.
   Another business station serving northern Virginia listeners,
WPGC-AM in Maryland, has been broadcasting since Oct. 1, 1989.
   Donna Francavilla, WPGC's program and news director, said
location has everything to do with the success her station.
   ``Given the level of education - the number of `suits' we have
in Washington - the level of sophistication and the fact that
residents in the Washington area are interested in national,
international and local news, we're far more likely to survive than
a station in a suburban area,'' she said.

   A radio talk show host who was supposed to
help moderate a gubernatorial debate Sept. 12 was removed from the
program after one of the candidates questioned his objectivity.
   Republican candidate Dave Frohnmayer's campaign demanded that
the League of Women Voters, sponsor of the debate, remove Alan
Siporin from the four-member debate panel.
   ``Siporin has made comments on the air during his radio program

   Siporin, of Eugene radio station KLCC, said he was shocked to
learn he had been removed. He said he had maintained good relations
with Frohnmayer, the state attorney general, over the years.
   ``If a person who is running for governor is willing to go to
these lengths to keep someone off a panel of journalists, you have
to wonder what kind of access the people of Oregon, through the
media, will have to the governor,'' Siporin said.
   Frohnmayer's debate with Democrat Barbara Roberts, independent
Al Mobley and Libertarian Fred Oerther was sponsored by the League
of Women Voters.

<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors said the process of
elimination points to a Christian Broadcasting Network technician
as the person who interrupted two adult entertainment channels with
religious messages.
   Defense attorneys for Thomas M. Haynie, however, told a jury
Sept. 11 that in its process of elimination, the government
eliminated the real culprit.
   James R. Wilson, a Justice Department attorney, said in opening
arguments:
   ``No one will take the witness stand for the government and say
that they saw or heard the defendant say or do anything for which
he could be charged. But we will show how it was done, from where
it was done, and by doing those two we will show who did it.''
   Stephen E. Story, Haynie's attorney, told jurors the government
will fail to prove its case because its engineering data on which
it is basing its case is flawed.
   ``The government doesn't have the right facility. This episode
did not happen at CBN,'' Story said.
   The Playboy Channel and Home Dish Only Inc.'s Exxxtasy Channel
were interrupted on Sept. 6, 1987, with a message flashed on
screens: ``Thus sayeth the Lord thy God. Remember the sabbath and
keep it holy. Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.''
   Wilson said the government will show CBN's satellite earth
station was the only such station operating at the time that could
have produced the religious message in the form it was sent and had
the power to pirate the two satellite channels.
   The only person working at the earth station that Sunday night
was Haynie, Wilson said.
   Haynie was indicted in April by a federal grand jury on three
counts of interfering with the operations of a satellite and three
counts of violating FCC licensing regulations.
   Story said the defense would challenge the government's
technical evidence and show that errors were made in calculations
and measurements vital to the prosecution's conclusion that Haynie
was guilty.
   Story said Federal Communications Commission investigators
ignored numerous other earth stations in their search for the
pirate. Story said the defense would offer several alternate
sources of the message.
   The trial was expected to last two weeks.

<HEAD>APME Selects Finalists for Public Service Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty newspapers have been selected as
finalists in the Associated Press Managing Editors association's
20th annual Public Service Awards competition.
   The finalists, announced Sept. 13, were chosen from 122 entries
- 79 from newspapers with more than 50,000 circulation and 43 from
newspapers with less than 50,000 circulation.
   One winner from each category will be announced in October at
the APME convention in Dallas.
   Finalists in the less-than-50,000 category, listed
alphabetically by city, are:
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune for its series ``A Price on Their
Heads,'' exposing the threat to elk, eagles, bear and other
wildlife posed by animal traders, trophy hunters and poachers.
   The Bismarck (N.D.) Tribune for its investigation into the abuse
of children placed in foster homes on the Standing Rock Indian
Reservation.
   The Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune for its articles about the
state's lax regulation of insurance companies. The reporting
prompted the withdrawal of a gubernatorial candidate and the
resignation of the state insurance commissioner.
   The Columbia Missourian for a special report that concluded the
public housing authority was not only the city's largest landlord
but also the worst. This and other coverage led to the resignation
of the authority's executive director and its chairman.
   The Livingston (Mont.) Enterprise for comprehensive coverage by
its five-member news staff of the large and secretive Church
Universal and Triumphant and its damaging impact on an area
adjacent to Yellowstone National Park.
   The Sun News of Myrtle Beach, S.C., for providing detailed,
helpful, responsible coverage of Hurricane Hugo even though its
plant was disabled. The newspaper organized a print and broadcast
pool to report from the battered oceanfront.
   The West County Times of Richmond, Calif., for its series
exposing safety and environmental violations at the San Francisco
Bay area's six oil refineries. As a result, the state increased
minimum fines for pollution from $1,000 to $10,000.
   The Salina (Kan.) Journal for articles about use of excessive
force by city police officers. The report led to a state
investigation and the retirement of the police chief.
   The Valley News Dispatch of Tarentum, Pa., for a series that
painstakingly documented the failure of local officials to collect
more than $10 million in taxes owed to the area's 13 school
districts.
   The Washington (N.C.) Daily News for revealing that for eight
years city officials had known cancer-causing chemicals were in the
tap water. The disclosure resulted in a two-month water ban, an
improved treatment system and state and federal reviews of water
regulations.
   Finalists among newspapers with more than 50,000 circulation
are:
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal for discovering a link between
the dietary supplement L-tryptophan and a rare and sometimes deadly
blood disorder. Ten days after the first story was published, the
federal government banned the sale of the supplement.
   The Chicago Tribune for its series ``A Dream in Jeopardy,'' a
comprehensive examination of cutbacks in corporate pensions and
health benefits and threats to the Social Security trust funds.
   The Des Moines (Iowa) Register for a series about the rape of an
Iowa woman and how she coped with the emotional trauma and legal
ordeal that followed. The woman's decision to be identified in the
account touched off a national debate over whether to keep secret
the names of rape victims.
   The Detroit News for uncovering the financial ties of the mayor
and police chief to a former deputy chief at the center of a
federal investigation into a secret police fund. Questionable
practices by the officials were documented in spite of the city
government's ``no comment'' policy when questioned by reporters.
   The Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader for its series ``Cheating Our
Children,'' on political interference in the state's public schools
and the failure of local officials to collect property taxes owed
to financially strapped school districts.
   The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., for a broad examination
of the state's public-school crisis. Articles published over six
months included four in-depth series on flaws in the tax system,
the special problems in Appalachia, the need for preschool programs
and ways to improve teaching.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer for its series ``The Blood Brokers,''
which lifted the veil from the unregulated, multibillion-dollar
business of buying and selling blood. Dog kennels in Pennsylvania
were inspected more often than blood banks, the series revealed.
   The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News for its comprehensive
coverage of the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated parts of
Northern California. The day after the disaster and during the
months that followed, readers received exhaustive reporting, vivid
writing, compelling photos and graphics, and public service
information.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer for its report ``Chemicals Ride
the Food Chain,'' which revealed that truckers haul orange juice,
baby food and other cargo destined for human consumption after
carrying toxic chemicals in the same tanks. The disclosure resulted
in a new state law prohibiting such practices and support for
similar legislation in Congress.
   The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, for its series ``The Secret Files of
Internal Affairs,'' based on a review of 200,000 police
disciplinary documents never before made public. The seven-month
project revealed that the department failed to prosecute officers
for assault, drunken driving and other crimes and that 98 percent
of citizens' complaints of police brutality were dismissed.
   Four newspapers were selected as finalists in the Freedom of
Information Award competition, according to David Hawpe, editor of
The Courier-Journal of Louisville and chairman of the APME Freedom
of Information Committee. The winner also will be announced at the
APME convention.
   The finalists are:
   The Detroit News, for an investigation tracing payments from a
secret Detroit police fund, through which more than $1 million in
taxpayer money was said to be laundered. The complex story touched
on the activities of a deputy police chief, Mayor Coleman Young and
others.
   The Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel, for a series on the
state of Florida's failure to impose adequate controls on care
centers, leading to deaths and injuries among such diverse groups
as infants, retarded adults and teen-age criminals.
   The Daily Reflector of Greenville, N.C., for revelations
concerning the background of a candidate for Superior Court judge,
resulting in legislation changing state law to open the records of
the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission.
   The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, for an examination of the
government's military recruiting system that suggested it promotes
corruption, undermines quality of the armed forces, and costs
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

   Environmentalists and loggers are conducting
rival lobbying campaigns on Capitol Hill this week in a high-stakes
political battle over the Northwest's oldest forests and the
northern spotted owl.
   The two sides scheduled meetings with members of Congress as two
House panels prepared to move forward with legislation addressing
forest protection and timber harvest levels.
   About 500 environmentalists rallied at the Capitol on Sunday to
protest a series of bills they say would further reduce the
shrinking supply of the nation's old-growth forests.
   ``The timer industry lobby has a national agenda as they grab
the wealth of public lands, operating from a national power base in
Congress,'' said Mark Winstein of Save America's Forests, a
grassroots organization that sponsored the demonstration.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Angered by Iraqi raids on the French and
other diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, U.N. representatives say
they're considering extending to air corridors the international
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   On Sunday, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution
condemning Iraq for violating diplomatic territory with Friday's
raids and warning that further sanctions were likely if Baghdad
continued to ignore U.N. resolutions.
   The U.S. ambassador, Thomas R. Pickering, said another
resolution would be drafted to impose an air embargo, a step the
United Nations has never taken against a nation.
   An air blockade would involve the interception of planes
approaching Iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering
hostilities than the boarding ships in the Persian Gulf, which has
been done under the U.N. naval embargo.
   ---&equals;
   DENVER (AP) - A toddler who was trapped for 14 hours in a
12-foot shaft at his parents' new home popped out ``like Superman''
after a firefighter crawling on his belly through a rescue tunnel
grasped the boy's hand.
   Twenty-month-old Kevin Davis was released from a hospital with
little more than a scraped elbow Sunday after being treated for
dehydration.
   Kevin listened to his mother sing nursery songs and busied
himself rolling mud balls as rescuers dug a parallel hole to the
shaft and then tunneled over to the boy, who had fallen in on
Saturday afternoon.
   ``I could hear him crying, but I couldn't touch him and I
couldn't help him,'' said his mother, Lisa Davis, fighting back
tears at a news conference at Denver General Hospital. ``It was
really difficult.''

   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - The leaders of Cambodia's government
and its three-party guerrilla opposition today convened a
U.N.-supported council formed in an effort to end 11 years of war
and create a neutral democratic nation.
   The Supreme National Council was formed at talks in Jakarta,
Indonesia last week after the groups agreed to a U.N.-drafted peace
plan.
   It was held at the Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok, which had been
abandoned since 1975. Over the weekend, 100 Thai workers cleared
the embassy of overgrown foliage and repainted it.
   The council has six seats for the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh
government and two spots for each of the rebel factions. The plan
also allows for a 13th seat for a chairman, but the post remains in
dispute.
   ---&equals;
   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel has appointed Yoram Aridor, a former
finance minister who has never held a diplomatic post, as its
ambassador to the United Nations.
   Aridor, 57, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, received the necessary Cabinet approval on
Sunday, a spokesman for Shamir's office said.
   The Foreign Ministry said Aridor will assume his post later this
month after the opening of the General Assembly in New York. He
will replace acting Ambassador Yochanan Bein, who will remain part
of Israel's U.N. delegation.
   The Israeli-born Aridor was named finance minister in 1981
during triple-digit inflation. He was forced to resign in 1983
after he backed an unpopular plan to tie the Israeli shekel to the
dollar.

<HEAD>Bush Sending Mixed Signals on U.S. Forces in Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After ordering U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia,
President Bush assured Congress that he did not believe hostilities
were imminent - although he is warning Saddam Hussein not to count
on it.
   That mixed message keeps U.S. military options open without
triggering a law under which Bush would have to get congressional
approval to keep forces in the Persian Gulf for more than 90 days.
   There's no doubt that Congress would agree. But the
administration doesn't want to get tangled in the war powers
resolution, a Vietnam-era legacy opposed by every president since
it was enacted over a veto. And congressional Democrats don't seem
anxious to force a vote that would tie them inextricably to Bush
policy, although they have so far applauded it.
   That's typical of a system that was supposed to make Congress a
partner in decisions of war and peace, but doesn't work.
   When he was in Congress, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said
the war powers measure should be repealed.
   ``... Congress typically tries to avoid responsibility for a
clear decision, avoids confrontation when presidents refuse to
invoke the act's terms, and prefers instead to praise successful
presidential actions or criticize unsuccessful ones after the
fact,'' Cheney said in a 1989 assessment, published by the American
Enterprise Institute.
   Under the war powers resolution approved in 1973, a president is
required to notify Congress within 48 hours when he sends
combat-ready forces abroad. When they are sent into ``situations
where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated''
they can't be kept there longer than 90 days unless the House and
Senate vote approval.
   ``I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent,''
Bush told the recessed Congress on Aug. 9, a day after U.S. forces
began deploying in Saudi Arabia. ``To the contrary, it is my belief
that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful resolution of the
crisis.''
   Bush also said that Americans were ready to defend themselves,
and that he could not predict how long they would be there.
   He has not altered the message, nor has he foreclosed further
military action, pointedly reserving that option at his Helsinki
summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We will continue to review all options with our allies, but
let it be clear: we will not let this aggression stand,'' Bush told
Congress at its joint session a week ago.
   Bush clearly has overwhelming congressional support for his
policy, and broader, national backing evidenced by the public
opinion polls. He said he wants to cooperate with Congress, while
citing his own constitutional powers as the basis for the Persian
Gulf operation.
   That's always been the war powers impasse; presidents claim the
inherent power to act in time of crisis to defend national
interests. They question the constitutionality of the resolution,
and argue that Congress can control warmaking with its power to
approve or deny appropriations.
   The question came up Friday at confirmation hearings on Supreme
Court nominee David H. Souter; he avoided taking a position on
constitutionality.
   While presidents have avoided imminent hostility reports that
would have triggered the war powers system, Congress did vote to
approve an extended deployment of U.S. troops in Lebanon in 1983,
but they were withdrawn anyhow after the suicide attack that killed
241 Americans at a Marine barracks.
   In operations that have been swift and brief, as in the attack
on Libya, and the invasions of Grenada and Panama, the 90-day
withdrawal rule wasn't a factor.
   In 1987, Senate critics of Ronald Reagan's Persian Gulf tanker
escort operation tried seven times to force the White House to
comply with the war powers procedure. Failing that, they tried in
court, and lost there, too.
   The war powers resolution began as an attempt to restrict Nixon
administration operations in Southeast Asia. It evolved into a
measure to give Congress a role in governing the use of forces in
crises and conflicts short of declared war.
   Since it hasn't worked, an overhaul was in the works before the
current crisis.
   ``I favor a very significant revision ... to eliminate the
automatic withdrawal provisions and to rely more heavily on
Congress' power of the purse to reflect the congressional will,''
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., told Cheney at an Armed Services Committee
hearing on the Persian Gulf operation.
   At the same hearing, Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine, said Bush
would do well to ask Congress for a vote in support of his policy,
even though he seems to have all the backing he needs now.
   ``Once there's blood on the sand, popular opinion might shift,
may very well shift, and Congress would then be in hot pursuit of
public opinion that's flowing in the opposite direction,'' Cohen
said.
   In his 1989 commentary, Cheney wrote:
   ``If the United States must use force for any extended period,
it would clearly be better for the country if the president were to
show the world that he had support for what he was doing.''

   Pity the poor reporters for supermarket
tabloids. No one takes them seriously. All that trash digging, gate
crashing and photo snapping is hard work.
   It's not easy being despised by the people you cover, ridiculed
by the literati and detested by your colleagues in the ``real''
press.
   Donna Balancia knows this well. She's been doing it for four
years, off and on, as a freelance reporter for the Star.
   She's crashed Roseanne Barr's wedding, impersonated a deranged
French woman, pretended to be a hospital patient - all for that
exclusive photo or exclusive interview with some sought-after
controversial celebrity or newsmaker.
   Now she wants out. Balancia's next quest? She wants to write
television shows, instead of chasing their stars.
   The way she is going about attaining that goal, however, gives
added meaning to art imitating life. If television can be
considered art.
   Balancia, or Dana Blanchard as she is known to Star readers, has
written, produced and directed a television pilot about the madcap
world of tabloid reporters; Aaron Spelling (``Dynasty,''
``Charlie's Angels,'' ``Love Boat'') is interested.
   ``This is going to be my big break,'' Balancia says by phone
from the Star's Beverly Hills office. ``It's pretty wacky.''
   Balancia is referring to her show, in which a young, female
tabloid reporter named Dana Blanchard looks for love and dirt in
the employ of ``National Spy,'' a Star-like publication populated
by all sorts of frenetic, off-the-wall gossip mongers.
   It's a little like ABC's ``Anything But Love'' gone amok. But
this is not Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis sending teasing
sexual glances across the newsroom of a Chicago magazine. Instead,
Blanchard falls for another reporter only to find that (gasp, sob)
he works for the competition.
   How Balancia came to make a television pilot in the first place
represents a new entree for would-be, small-screen moguls.
   She enrolled in a University of California at Los Angeles
extension course named ``The Ultimate Hyphenate,'' taught for the
first time this year.
   Instructor and Emmy-winning director Lila Garrett, head of
comedy for Aaron Spelling Productions, selected nine students for
the 24-week class. Each student wrote, produced and directed his or
her own television pilot. Spelling will review every finished piece
of work and has first right of refusal to option the project and
shop it to TV networks.
   Balancia's pilot and several others caught Garrett's eye because
they were fresh and innovative. In the world of television, little
emphasis is placed on on either adjective.
   ``My students really wrote new stuff,'' said Garrett. ``They're
so hip and they're so well done, it would be a shame if these tapes
didn't get an airing.''
   And while Spelling's involvement is no promise that these
pilots, including Balancia's, will reach prime time, ``it is a
very, very good entree to the television business,'' Garrett said.
``And these students would have a much harder time getting anyone
to pay attention to them without this.''
   Balancia's pilot is waiting to be edited and then reviewed by
Spelling, Garrett said. ``She's a journalist and it's a very
original idea. She wrote a very funny pilot.''
   Much of it (but not the love part, Balancia stresses) was culled
from the Star reporter's own experiences.
   In one scene, intrepid Dana Blanchard is tearing through a
celebrity's garbage can, looking for dirt (so to speak). ``That
part is completely made up,'' Balancia emphatically says.
   Balancia was a reporter for UPI and Gannett News Service before
making the jump to tabloids.
   Working for the Star, Balancia says, is a lot more fun.
   About six weeks ago, the paper sent her to Tahiti, where
Cheyenne Brando was rumored to be in a mental institution following
the shooting of her husband. Cheyenne's half-brother, Christian, is
awaiting trial for the slaying.
   The daughter of enigmatic actor Marlon Brando was indeed in a
psychiatric hospital, Balancia says. So the 30-year-old Star
journalist walked right onto the hospital grounds, pretended to be
a French mental patient and asked for Cheyenne.
   She got as far as the laundry room. ``The nurse started ripping
into French with me and I couldn't speak that quickly,'' says
Balancia, who studied the language in high school.
   ``I said I was a friend of Cheyenne's and they basically said
`Get out of here.' ''
   Still, Balancia says the trip was not a bust. She interviewed
the family and Cheyenne's brother, Teihotu. The star's photographer
got an exclusive shot of Cheyenne's freshly cropped, bleached-blond
head.
   Balancia says such adventures are exciting, but she really feels
called to television writing.
   Besides, she says, the money is better.

   It is difficult to view recessions as
opportunities, since everything seems to drop: economic growth,
marketplace values, jobs, profits and perhaps most important, hope
in the future.
   But there are people whose hopes rise while everything about
them is falling. They might not cheer the arrival of recession,
attended by its pain, but they view it as a chance to participate
in the future.
   These people are true investors: They recognize value, are
willing to take an informed risk and retain an innate faith in the
economy's ability to recover. When it recovers, so does the market
value of well-chosen investments.
   While recessions conceivably can continue for years - as in the
Great Depression of the 1930s - the eight official economic
recessions since World War II have lasted an average of 12 months.
   In the depths of these recessions, stock prices have dived as
much as 48 percent, as in the recession that began in late 1973.
Many of the bargains found in these sales subsequently rose to
multiples of their purchase prices.
   Two things prevent people from taking advantage of such sales: a
lack of money, since few people have the foresight, opportunity or
means to prepare for a recession; and the courage to buy, even
among hardy investors.
   The point has meaning at the moment, since many economists who
earlier had been fence-sitting now are forecasting a recession over
the next few months and into 1991, a mild one perhaps, but enough
to qualify.
   A recession doesn't necessarily mean a sharp downturn in stock
prices, but that has been the experience prior to each of the
recessions of the past 45 years. There have been no exceptions:
Prior to each recession, stocks fell.
   Nobody has yet demonstrated that recession is certain, but
bargain-hunting investors are getting ready, in case.
   Gerald Perritt, editor of the newsletter Blue Chip Values,
studied the experience of investors during those earlier recessions
and found some bargain-hunters.
   First, he found that during the typical bear market stock prices
wound down over many months, and that what at first appeared to be
the bottom gave way to further price deterioration.
   Often, he found, bargain-hunters jumped too early, and regretted
it as prices continued to fall. A prolonged bear market, he found,
is characterized by ``dead cat bounces,'' or brief increases that
merely lead to more declines.
   As prices continue to decline, he says, even long-term investors
begin to waver and dump their stocks in an attempt to salvage what
remains of their portfolios. Usually this occurs near the ultimate
bottom.
   Since nobody knows when a bounce is a ``dead cat'' or when a
bottom is the ultimate, Perritt believes smart investors must
follow rules of restraint.
   Based on his studies, he believes the best time to buy in bear
markets is three to six months after a recession begins. Since
World War II, recessions have ranged from seven to 17 months, with
12 months the average.
   In buying at midway in the recession, bargain-hunters would be
relying on two factors favorable to prices: The Federal Reserve
will attemp to pump money into the economy and the extreme
optimists will think of buying.
   Buying at midway, however, isn't easy. The economic numbers will
look bad, the pessimists will be in their glory, the news reports
may sound foreboding and economic confidence may be shot.
   By Perritt's reckoning, however, that is when you must make your
move. Just as the stock market falls prior to recession, it rises
prior to recovery. Not to move decisively might mean losing out on
the best buys in years.

   DETROIT (AP)- With anxious eyes on the Middle East, Americans
are suddenly aware that there are Arabs in their midst just as
American as they are, rich, bold, colorful tiles in the American
mosaic.
   For years they were an invisible minority, self-clothed in
ethnic and national anonymity.
   No one seemed to know or care whither they came. When the Tokyo
Olympics were televised in 1972 and the athletes of the world
paraded under their national banners, one TV commentator looked
down on one sparse Middle East contingent and concluded it was
``one of those new countries in Africa.''
   Today, Arab Americans constitue 1 percent of the U.S.
population, some 2.5 million in all. Most are clearly surprised,
even proud, to discover so many of their kind have risen to
prominence in their adopted land.
   If they were given an ethnic quiz, few would know:
   -That Christa McAuliffe, the inspirational schoolteacher who
died aboard the shuttle Challenger was one of their own.
   -That George Mitchell, Democratic Majority leader in the Senate,
and John Sununu, chief of staff in the Bush White House and former
governor of New Hampshire, have Lebanese blood.
   -Arab Americans include UCLA basketball coach Jim Harrick,
pioneer heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, Heisman Trophy winner and
pro quarterback Doug Flutie, Oscar winner (for ``Amadeus'') F. (for
Fahrid) Murray Abraham, actor Jamie Farr of ``MASH'' fame, dean of
the White House press corps Helen Thomas, founder of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving Candy Lightner, consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, author and movie producer William Peter Blatty (``The
Exorcist''), Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, Miami Heat
basketball star Ron Seikaly, radio disc jockey Casey Kasem, chess
champion Yasser Seirawan, singer-songwriter Paul Anka.
   They demolish the stereotypical image of the Arab as a shadowy
arms dealer, or a swarthy bedouin charlatan waving a scimitar as he
charges across the desert on an Arabian steed, or the irresistible
lover a la Rudolph Valentino in the old silent movies.
   Or the obedient, shrouded Arab women, suppressed by male
masters, keening over the dead in eerie wails.
   The greatest contradictions to these stereotypes are the Arab
Americans themselves. Can anyone imagine Marlo Thomas, one of the
nation's most ardent feminists, in purdah, or walking three paces
to the rear of husband Phil Donohue? And how can anyone compare her
father, actor-philanthropist Danny Thomas, raising money for St.
Jude's Children's Hospital, with some cinematic scimitar-weilding
terrorist?
   ``We have the most assimilated ethnic group in the country,''
says William Baroody, Jr., former chief of the Reagan White House
Office of Communication. ``A lot of them just weren't known as
quote-unquote Arab Americans.''
   ``We've always been a kind of private people,'' says Baroody,
whose grandparents came to the United States around the turn of the
century. ``I think you are seeing a much greater awareness on the
part of young people now, a greater involvement. ... I think that
they are a little more proud.''
   If previous generations tended to lose their identity in the
melting pot, present generations tend to be culturally distinct
parts of the mosaic.
   ``I think that's true of all ethnic groups,'' Baroody says,
``but it is definitely true of Arab Americans.''
   There is a growing pride in their Arabic background, in their
culture, their history. Every Arab American knows that the Arab
world, larger than the Roman Empire at its peak, preserved the arts
and sciences as Europe fell into intellectual darkness and waited
for the Renaissance. The Arab American knows that his fellow
Americans use the Arabic alphabet and numbers.
   The influx of Arabs to the United States began about 1880,
recruited as cheap labor for America. Most very simply sought the
gold that paved the streets.
   ``The real gold they found was opportunity,'' says Alixa Naff,
who has specialized in Arab American history and works at the
Smithsonian Institution. She says it is a fiction that they were in
flight from the Turks who controlled much of the Arab world until
World War I, although some young men did flee compulsory
conscription into the Turkish Army beginning in 1908.
   They were natural entrepreneurs. Many of them did what they knew
best, growing and mareting produce, fruits and vegetables.
   But they were also merchants and most began peddling notions and
Bibles out of a suitcase from the mountains of West Virginia to the
plains of the Midwest. They built the ``Mother Mosque'' in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, in 1934 and Syrian Orthodox Churches throughout
California.
   Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, came
from Cleveland where there was a large Lebanese Maronite Catholic
community. Her father owned grocery stores and eventually went into
real estate.
   ``My father was a very unusual man,'' he says. ``He believed in
women's education. My mother was a college graduate; my father was
not. He encouraged her to go to law school.''
   Almost every Middle Easterner of the second and third
generations speaks of supportive families and a commitment to
education.
   ``I fulfilled the dreams of my grandparents,'' says Shalala, who
was a professor at Columbia University, president of Hunter
College, a governor of the American Stock Exchange and a director
of the Municipal Assistance Corp. which helped New York City out of
its fiscal crisis. She is also vice chairman of the Children's
Defense Fund.
   The latest immigrants are fleeing for their lives, mostly
agrarian Moslem families from southern Lebanon, but there are also
Iraqi Chaldeans and some Palestinians, some of them professionals,
many of them seeking greater opportunities. The Yemenis are fleeing
poverty to seek jobs in idled auto plants or to work the fields of
California.
   Ismael Ahmed runs the Arab Community Center for Economics and
Social Services (ACCESS) in a depressed neighborhood of southern
suburban Dearborn, practically under the smokestacks of the Ford
River Rouge plant. The area he serves is considered the largest
concentrated Arab community outside the Middle East.
   ``Just within five miles of our center there are 60,000 Arabic
speaking people,'' Ahmed says. ``Six out of 10 of them have been
here less than five years, one out of three doesn't speak English,
two out of three don't read or write English, and one out of three
doesn't read or write Arabic.

   ``There is an infant mortality rate of 38.5 per thousand births,
which is as high as a lot of Third World countries. The
unemployment rate is from 30 percent to 40 percent, always.''
   Yet, Ahmed says, there are up to 5,000 new Middle Eastern
immigrants ariving in Detroit each year, many of them seeking out
family. ``Right now the majority can be described as refugees
without refugee status.'' His center provides a base for
transition.
   And despite the illiteracy, many do well. They learn to read and
write English in less time than it takes an American grade school
pupil to reach the sixth-grade level. Ahmed's English classes can
handle 250 people and there is never an empty slot.
   ``In 10 years a new immigrant family will be buying a house in a
much nicer part of town,'' Ahmed says. ``And people will say,
`Where did they get the money to do that? They just got here.'
Well, they didn't go to the movies and they made do. They
systematically aimed at that kind of jump and they helped others in
their family to do it too.''
   It is the same sense of family that enabled previous waves of
immigrants from otherareas to advance in the space of two
generations.
   But while the new Arab Americans are similar, they are different
too.
   ``At one time Detroit's Arab community was overwhelmingly
Christian,'' Ahmed says. ``That's changed. I think it's much closer
to equal now with the Moslems.''
   Arab Americans also have ``that feeling you are worth
something,'' he says. ``Your religion, your culture is worth
protecting. It's stronger now among the new immigrants. It's
something we work with.''
   He sees many individual success stories, but he is more amazed
with the general tide of advancement and its regularity. Some
first-generation families will never be rich, but their aim is to
establish a jumping off place for their children.
   That, of course, is something in common for all immigrants, Arab
or otherwise, past or present. Like others they tend at the
beginning to cluster together where they can share ethnicity in
kitchen and church. Today the greatest concentrations besides
Detroit are southern California, Brooklyn, N.Y., the
Cleveland-Toledo area, Illinois, Massachusetts and Texas.
   Their success says something of the American climate for
opportunity and change.
   Donna Shalala remembers her father telling her of anti-Arab
discrimination in his early days. But by the time she was ready to
emerge from the shelter of her family, ``those barriers were down
for me. When I got to New York I was a little more conscious of it
because of the size of the Jewish community. But I found them very
supportive, very helpful and very protective. Prominent leaders in
the Jewish community were good friends and watched out for me
because the issue would arise once in a while.''
   Today she is a member of a no-name, informal group of 10
composed of Jewish leaders and Arab Americans, such as former
special Middle Eastern envoy Philip Habib and former head of Pan
American Airways Najeeb Halaby.
   When Col. James Jabara became America's first jet ace during the
Korean War, or when Joe Robbie, the son of a poolroom owner, bought
the Miami Dolphins, Arab Americans were not in the habit of
exhibiting their ethnic pride.
   Don Bustany, a radio producer who works with Casey Kasem, says
he never thought consciously of ``assimilation or being absorbed''
in American society. ``I always had my pita bread sandwiches in
high school and my friends were delighted when they could share
Arabic food at my house,'' he says.
   He also remembers the exhilaration at meeting a fellow Arab
American, when the common salutation was ``Keefic Cousin.''
   He grew up with the attitude that Lebanese were superior people.
``I discovered not only was that not true, but every ethnic group
believes that they are,'' he says.
   Casey Kasem, who like Bustany grew up in Detroit where he acted
in a community playhouse with George C. Scott, is emerging as a
spokesman for an affirmative Arab image. He is working with Norm
Fleischman, who is known as ``the conscience of Hollywood'' to
carry that message to the movers and shakers of film and TV.
   He suspects the negativism came over from Europe when the Arab
world was viewed as a threat to Christian nations and the Crusaders
were sent out to battle Saladin in the Holy Land.
   ``Arab Americans are coming out of the closet,'' he says. ``They
are more outspoken now than ever before. People are beginning to
realize who they really are, that they are not the people who yell
and scream on their nightly newscast.''
   And in fact he and Bustany are proponents of the Cousins program
of the Middle East Foundation for Peace, holding meetings in
various cities between Arab and Jewish Americans. The meetings are
frequently loud and always confrontational, but they are the
beginning of a dialogue between both sides.
   There was a time when poet Khalil Gibran was about the only Arab
American known to most Americans, several generations of which
discovered his ``The Prophet'' in college or high school. But today
they are all over the American landscape from teen pop singer
Tiffany to singer-dancer Paula Abdul, from Indianapolis Colts
quarterback Jeff George to mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias, who last
year sang in the New York City Opera's ``Sweeney Todd.''
   They are peppered through the federal capitol and state capitols
and the courts, North and South. There are Arab American mayors
from St. Paul, Minn., to Hartwell, Ga., from Azusa, Calif., to
Peoria, Ill. An Arab American heads Wayne State University.
   Race car driver Bobby Rahal is balding, wears glasses and is, in
short, not your typical race car driver. But his father once told
an interviewer, ``It's in the genes. The Arab people, the Lebanese
especially, always run scared. That's what drives us. We're more
afraid of failure than anything. It's an ego thing. We hate the
flavor of failure and we revel in success.''
   There is also Selwa (Lucky) Roosevelt. She is, like Casey Kasem,
a Druze, married to former CIA officer Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt,
a grandson of Theodore Roosevelt. Her job is chief of protocol for
the White House.
   She once said, ``If I had as a child any experience of sadness,
I suppose it was because I wasn't blond and blue-eyed and the girl
next door.'' But she says she came to love her background,
recognizing it made her an object of interest, and gave her more
empathy.

<TEXT>
   The doors of North America's first
Islamic mosque, built here 86 years ago, have long been closed. But
Islam is flourishing for the Muslims who have been practicing their
faith here since the turn of the century.
   Twice a week members of the 400-strong Muslim community come to
the Cedar Rapids Islamic Center to pray, socialize and learn, just
as their great-grandparents and grandparents did when they built a
white-framed mosque, known as the ``Mother Mosque,'' in 1934.
   ``The original mosque was like a family club,'' says Taha A.
El-Tawil, the Imam, or spiritual leader, of the center. ``People
came there with their children and family. It was like a community
gathering place.''
   The Mother Mosque was the center of activity for the city's
Muslims until 1972, when the Islamic Center opened to accommodate a
growing population. The center, built for about $500,000, has five
classrooms, a small library, a large lecture hall, offices and the
traditional Prayer Hall where the faithful bow on a thick, dark
blue carpet as they face northeast to pray.
   ``It still is a gathering place. Once a month there's a family
picnic. Once a year there's a picnic for the community,'' El-Tawil
says.
   El-Tawil says the rich farmland around Cedar Rapids attracted
the first Muslims to the area. By about 1914 there were 45 Muslim
immigrants. By the mid-1920s, after supplying eggs, butter and
other farm products to urban dwellers, they had opened more than 50
shops and stores in the city.
   Eventually, the Federation of Islamic Associations, linking
centers throughout North America, was first organized in Cedar
Rapids. It is now headquartered in Detroit.
   El-Tawil says followers of Islam have always been accepted by
Iowans, even during the Iran hostage crisis and this summer's
tensions with Iraq.
   ``Iowans in general are very good people,'' he says. ``I think
there is a special attention, or treatment, for the Muslims in Iowa
more than in places like Chicago, New York or Los Angeles.
   ``Some people did call the mosque during the hostage crisis and
said it was wrong. But not from decent people.''
   Even though the Muslims have been worshipping in the community
for decades, El-Tawil says there is still confusion over who
Muslims are.
   ``Muslims are not just Arabs,'' he says. ``There are 1 billion
Muslims in the world and only 6 percent are Arabs. Islam has no
nationality.''
   In Cedar Rapids, about 60 percent of the Muslims are Lebanese.
The rest are from Pakistan, India, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Jordan,
Iran, Egypt and the Soviet Union.
   Two years ago, El-Tawil helped organize the Islamic Council of
Iowa to coordinate the activities and services of the state's 7,200
Muslims.
   ``The council wants to build bridges between the Muslim
community and other communities. We want to unify the work of
Islam,'' says El-Tawil, who is chairman of the seven-member
council.
   The council also serves as a public relations outlet ``in case
something happens in the Persian Gulf where reaction is asked of
the Muslim community,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's a sinister land of villany and poverty,
intriguing voodoo rites and exotic art. Haiti, once the richest of
the French colonies, is today one of the world's poorest countries,
thanks to a succession of corrupt despots. There is some hope,
however, that elections to be held this year will bring reforms.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - A few months before his death in
1971, President-for-Life Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier named his
19-year-old son Jean-Claude as his successor. Haitians accepted the
choice by approving a constitutional referendum. The vote was
2,391,916 to 0.
   The country doctor who ruled for 14 years by terror and graft
thus bestowed his spoils on the beefy, indulged teen-ager, ``Baby
Doc,'' who would carry on the family tradition 15 more years.
   In the grip of oppression and poverty, Haitians nourish a
culture enriched by French, African and Caribbean influences. Their
mysterious voodoo thrives alongside the official Roman Catholic
religion.
   Their love of beauty has produced world-famous art and finds
expression not just in paintings but in elegantly designed
gingerbread houses, festively painted ``tap-tap'' buses, even the
pretty ribbons worn by little girls in the slums.
   But the legacy of the Duvaliers and other Haitian despots is a
land wracked by political upheaval, corruption and neglect.
   Indeed, Haiti has been misruled by emperors, dictators and
generals virtually ever since the slaves overthrew their French
colonial masters and founded the world's first black-led republic
on Jan. 1, 1804.
   Once France's richest colony, Haiti, which shares the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, is among the
world's poorest countries. Statistics compiled by the U.S. Agency
for International Development reflect the scale of the calamity:
   Haiti's 6 million inhabitants have an estimated per capita
income of 85 cents a day. Seven of 10 scratch out a subsistence
living on meager cropland. Fewer than half can read and write, and
two-thirds of the children never finish primary school. Four of
five people have no access to safe drinking water. Only one of four
children is immunized against measles and 25,000 die each year of
diarrhea. Life expectancy is 53 years.
   Barren, erosion-scarred hills bear witness to decades of
uncontrolled felling of trees for charcoal, the main cooking fuel.
As recently as 1923, forests covered 60 percent of the land. Today,
forests cover 2 percent. As a result of erosion, 14,800 acres are
lost to productive agriculture each year.
   Farmers, unable to feed their families, stream to the cities in
search of $3-a-day jobs in assembly plants producing everything
from electronics to baseballs. Most find no work: the rate of
unemployment and underemployment is estimated at 70 percent.
   Many drift into the vast seafront shantytown known as Cite
Soleil (City of the Sun), the biggest of Port-au-Prince's many
slums.
   Here, an estimated 200,000 people live mainly in squalid,
one-room hovels made of scrap tin and boards, with dirt floors and
no plumbing or lights. A field is their communal toilet. A hill of
garbage rots in the tropical heat.
   Children play a stick game over a filthy open trench while
others wander in the maze of narrow alleys separating their shacks.
A knot the size of a fist protrudes from one boy's navel, the
common sign of an untreated hernia. Another has a distended belly
like the victims of the Ethiopian famine.
   ``Sometimes when you wake up you find something to eat; other
days you don't,'' Fannie Joseph, 46, says in the Creole patois
spoken by most Haitains. She said two of her five children died of
tetanus.
   Most foreign aid to Haiti, including $70 million a year from the
United States, was withdrawn in protest of an election massacre
three years ago. Although Haiti offers abundant cheap labor,
foreign companies are reluctant to invest in such a politically
volatile country.
   At one time, Haiti was a favorite Caribbean watering hole of
celebrities and literati seeking the exotic French- and
Creole-speaking land of Graham Greene's novel ``The Comedians,''
about life under Papa Doc Duvalier.
   Now, tourism, the economic lifeblood of most of Haiti's island
neighbors, has been all but wiped out by political turmoil and by
the spread of AIDS. The notion that AIDS originated in Haiti,
though now rejected by both U.S. and Haitian researchers, has made
matters worse.

<TEXT>
   ``It's agonizing,'' says Maurice Lafortune, the commerce
minister. ``Any political instability causes a drop in tourism. And
then there are all the consequences of the accusation that AIDS
comes from us.''
   In desperation, Haitians sell what little they own for a
perilous sea passage to the United States in leaky, overcrowded
boats. Often as not, those who make it end up in Miami's Krome
Detention Center to await deportation.
   Many of Haiti's current problems can be traced to the repressive
and corrupt methods of the 29-year Duvalier dynasty, which rose to
power in the politically unsettled aftermath of the U.S. occupation
of 1915-1934.
   Dr. Francois Duvalier, who combined a far-right political
ideology with a rural medical practice, became president in the
fraudulent election of 1957 as the candidate of the black masses at
a time of economic and political domination by the mulatto elite.
   Papa Doc championed African traditions such as voodoo,
encouraging his subjects to regard him as the embodiment of Baron
Samedi, a nefarious spirit that oversees cemeteries. He enforced
his will by dividing the army and organizing a private militia of
informers, extortionists and killers known as the Tonton Macoutes,
numbering in the thousands.
   Although the militia was officially disbanded after Jean-Claude
Duvalier was overthrown by a popular uprising in February 1986, the
Macoutes have never been brought to trial and still wield
influence.
   Along with Haiti's notoriously corrupt, 6,000-member army, they
remain the chief obstacle to democracy. In effect, Haiti has never
been liberated.
   ``Imagine Nazi Germany after the fall of Hitler without a purge
of Nazis from the state apparatus and without the Nuremberg
trials,'' says human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux.
   The widespread smuggling, drug-trafficking and corrupt business
practices of today's Haiti also echo the Duvaliers, who amassed
their fortune by siphoning profits from state industries and
forcing businessmen to pay huge kickbacks for franchises and import
licenses.
   ``Our legacy is a legacy of corruption, as you know,'' says
Commerce Minister Lafortune, who has set up an Anti-Smuggling
Brigade to try to slow the flood of untaxed cigarettes, radios, and
pocket calculators sold openly on the streets of Port-au-Prince.
   Now, more than four years after Baby Doc fled to France with an
estimated $600 million in plunder, only to be replaced by four
successive regimes either led or controlled by the army, Haitians
are still struggling to install a democratic government.
   The caretaker civilian government of President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, which was appointed in March after the fall of
the latest military ruler, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avrl, is planning
elections sometime this year.
   As if following a script, Duvalier hard-liners have re-emerged
to spoil the vote. Gunfire again crackles nightly in the slums,
armed robberies and killings go unpunished and people are afraid to
leave their homes after dark.
   It is chillingly reminiscent of the terror campaign in the
months before Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections, on
Nov. 29, 1987. That election was canceled after gangsters supported
by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at polling
stations.
   Haiti's political leaders agree that the nation stands little
chance of recovery unless the Duvalier legacy is somehow destroyed.
But many Haitians doubt that the increasingly unpopular civilian
government will be able to keep to the election timetable.
   ``It's 200 years of repressive government we are trying to
change,'' says Marc Bazin, a former World Bank economist and
leading presidential candidate. ``This country really is at a
crossroads.''
   Bazin, who has proposed a $600 million emergency aid package
from the World Bank to begin rebuilding Haiti, says the economy
could turn around within 10 years under the right circumstances.
   ``We're starting from sub-zero,'' he says. ``People will be
amazed at the speed we can go once we start.''
   ``We are intelligent enough, we are industrious enough that if
we have a government that is working for the people, instead of the
people working for the government, we can make Haiti the most
productive nation in the Caribbean.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Relentless poverty in Haiti has
driven an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 children into the streets of
this capital city. They survive as beggars, thieves and
prostitutes.
   ``The heads of families can't provide for themselves, much less
their children, so the children are on the street,'' says Jean
Robert Chery, a social psychologist.
   Chery runs a training center for 150 boys for the Montreal-based
Canadian Center for Research and International Studies. The boys
range in age from 6 to 20 and nearly all are homeless.
   Chery and his four co-workers feed the boys, give them medical
care and try to prepare them for school and jobs. The boys learn to
read, and they play dice and board games to improve their math.
   But first, Chery says, they must learn the most basic of skills:
``How to wash up in the morning, how to sit up straight, how to
talk to somebody.''
   Fifteen of the boys are practicing homosexuals, and
three-fourths have had homosexual relations, some for money and
some because of sexual confusion, Chery says.
   ``It's precocious sexuality,'' the psychologist says. ``They
live in promiscuous conditions. They have no mother or father. They
have no one to identify with sexually.''
   The younger boys suffer from malnutrition. ``Their hair turns
yellow and they're very, very skinny,'' Chery says. Many of the
older boys are infected with venereal diseases, although so far
there have been no detected cases of AIDS.
   ``They come here and tell their life stories and I find out
they're criminals,'' Chery says. ``They should be in probation
centers. But if they're turned over to the police they'll be
beaten.''
   Nearly all street children are boys, the reseacher says.
``Little girls are channeled into domestic service or prostitution.
They're not on the streets.''
   One of the regulars at the center is 14-year-old Etan. Prompted
by Chery, the youth lifts his T-shirt to expose a jagged scar
across his belly. He says that's where he was shot by robbers who
broke into his home in the Cite Soleil slum and killed his father.
   Unlike most of the other boys, Etan goes to school. Chery
proudly points out that he is first in his class.
   ``I want to work with electronics,'' Etan says.
   The center is a cramped four rooms in downtown Port-au-Prince.
On this particular day, Chery tries to give a visitor a tour of the
facilities, but a citywide electricity outage makes it difficult.
   In one room, a half-dozen boys sit around a table in the
semi-dark eating oatmeal from tin plates.
   ``We live under miserable conditions, but it's all we have,''
Chery says.
   The researcher says the center has enough money for rent but
with hardly anything left over. The government provides no funds.
   ``You have to have a state that is assuming its
responsibilities,'' Chery says. ``That's not the case.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - He was a long-distance runner on the U.S.
Olympic team, a record setter in college, and later an active
outdoorsman. Then 11 years ago Max Truex was felled by Parkinson's
disease. Following controversial brain surgery in China, he's
showing marked improvement as the medical community debates the
ethics of the procedure.

   Max Truex displays the snapshot of his
daaged brain like a proud father showing off the first photo of
his newborn child.
   He points to two red spots in the center. They indicate that
controversial brain surgery to give him a fresh shot at life is
working.
   Truex, once one of America's greatest long-distance runners, was
rendered helpless by severe Parkinson's disease.
   In his worst moments, he had to be spoon-fed. He couldn't
swallow and he lost his voice. He would propel forward
uncontrollably and smash into a wall. His body would freeze, and
his wife and children would get him moving again.
   ``It was like carrying a corpse,'' says his wife, Kay.
   He had tremors in both arms. He couldn't change his blank facial
expression. The former Olympic runner needed a wheelchair.
   That put an end to his active life as a successful Los Angeles
attorney who jogged, took backpacking trips, skied and hunted in
Africa.
   In the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Truex ran the fastest 10,000-meter
race by any American in track history to that point. Today, he
limps slowly toward his living room couch, sits and points to the
colorful photo made July 6 at UCLA during a brain scan to check his
condition.
   In a rare operation, performed in China on April 27, 1989 when
he was 53, brain tissue from three aborted fetuses was put in
Truex's brain. The red spots show the tissue has spread and
produced a vital chemical, dopamine, that he lacked.
   ``That really confirms for him that he's got a future,'' says
Dr. Robert Iacono, the surgeon. ``Max was really to the point where
I don't think he was going to survive. He had the worst case I've
seen.''
   Dopamine helps transmit nerve impulses between brain cells. A
person running out of it is like a car running out of gas, says
Iacono, assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of
Arizona.
   The surgery took him and Truex to a small hospital in China,
where oxygen is delivered by donkey cart, and to the fuzzy
boundaries of medical ethics. The U.S. government has banned
federal funding of research on fetal brain tissue transplants on
grounds it would encourage abortions.
   That issue was secondary to Truex, whose disease was diagnosed
in 1979 and who had deteriorated steadily in the five years before
the surgery.
   ``In China, they only allow two children per family. The third
one has to be aborted, so it would be aborted anyway,'' he says in
a soft, barely audible voice. ``It's a chance I had to take.''
   Now, the wheelchair remains folded up beside the couch. His gait
is still awkward, he tires easily, he has tremors in his right arm
and he occasionally stutters. But he has improved.
   ``I don't lose my balance anymore,'' Truex says. ``I don't fall.
I don't freeze up very often, and I can smile.''
   His wife, 43, has noticed he's less depressed and jokes more. He
even cooks dinner on the backyard grill for her and their kids -
Gene, 16, John, 13, and Mindy, 10.
   Across from his white, three-story home on a quiet street in
this comfortable Boston suburb, a pleasant, grassy area rises
gently. Now Truex can stroll with Kay around its perimeter, perhaps
the distance of a quarter-mile track, without getting exhausted.
   He no longer has to awaken her five times a night to help him
turn over or take him to the bathroom. Gene and John no longer have
to hold the urinal for him.
   Truex, whose short gray hair hides the spots where six holes
were drilled in his skull, almost certainly will never return to
his pre-Parkinson's condition. Iacono thinks Truex suffered some
mental impairment.
   Fred Olds remembers a different Truex. As his coach at Warsaw
High School in Indiana, Olds recalls how opponents would laugh at
the tiny Truex, who evennow stands just 5-feet-4{-inches. Then the
race would begin.
   ``He would lap the whole field,'' Olds says. ``He was probably
as perfect an athlete as I ever saw.''

   Truex, who later was on the track team at the University of
Southern California, was a serious and intelligent youngster, a bit
shy and not at all cocky, Olds says. He had an unquenchable thirst
for running.
   A grainy, 36-year-old, black-and-white film shows the towheaded
Truex setting the national schoolboy mile record of 4 minutes, 20.4
seconds.
   Jim Beatty, the first person to break the four-minute mile
barrier indoors and Truex's teammate in the 1960 Olympics, ran
against Truex in college.
   ``The picture that would stay with you of Maxie is this little
gutsy runner pounding at you around the track, lap after lap after
lap,'' Beatty saysed States but
found it easier to go to the Henan Tumor Institute in Zhengzhou,
China, about 400 miles southwest of Beijing.
   Preparatory surgery was done at the University of Arizona where
the holes were drilled in Truex's skull to provide passageways for
the transplanted tissue.
   In China, a gynecologist ``got on her bicycle and rode around to
the other hospitals to talk to friends to see if they would give us
some tissue,'' Iacono says.
   The U.S. ban on federal funding for research on fetal tissue
transplants was imposed in May 1988. The following November, a
National Institutes of Health advisory committee concluded it is
morally acceptable to use human fetal tissue from legal abortions
for research and therapy.
   But that recommendation was rejected last November by Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan. He extended the ban
indefinitely, saying such research ``will increase the incidence of
abortion across the country.''
   ``There is no evidence that that's true,'' says Dr. Murray
Goldstein, director of the NIH's National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md. ``He felt from a moral
viewpoint, not scientific, that it was improper'' to lift the ban.
   Under the projected guidelines for doing the research, Goldstein
says, the mother would give permission for aborted tissue to be
used but wouldn't know if it were used. Also, neither the doctor
doing the tissue transplant nor the recipient of the tissue would
know where it came from.
   ``From my standpoint, I think it is an experiment worth doing
under experimental conditions,'' he says. ``The reason I wanted it
done at NIH is that it would be done under the spotlight of public
scrutiny.''
   Privately funded fetal brain tissue transplants have taken place
in the United States. There have been similar transplants in
Mexico, England, Cuba, Spain and Sweden. Iacono says Truex's case
was unique because he received more brain tissue than other
patients.
   With Truex, he says, ``we've been able to reverse this always
progressive disorder. I feel real secure that what I did was right,
and it wasn't immoral and unethical.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It sounds like something Disney would do, build
replicas of the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs for the tourists to look
at. But the people responsible for preserving Egypt's antiquities
say they have little choice. The real tombs are deteriorating
rapidly in the crush of the tourist flow. To close them would mean
losing the tourist trade.

<TEXT>
   Egypt's pharaohs built their tombs to last
an eternity. But some of the most magnificent of the royal resting
places may not make it much past the 20th century.
   A main spoiler is man.
   Drawn by ancient Egypt's aura of mystery, thousands of visitors
parade every day through the once off-limits world of dead pharaohs
and their queens. They violate tomb chambers designed by ancient
priests for one mummy-filled coffin.
   With that in mind, a Swiss group has come up with a
multimillion-dollar answer: Custom-built tombs, clustered in a new
``valley of death,'' especially groomed to accommodate mass
tourism.
   Give the tourists what they've come to see, but in facsimile.
   ``If you want to have your tourists and save your tombs,
building replicas is the only answer,'' says Theodor Abt, president
of the Zurich-based Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt.
   ``We haven't a minute to lose,'' he says. ``Each time I come I'm
shocked to see what has happened. The world can't afford to give up
something so unique and precious.''
   Egyptian officials agree. In March they approved a proposal from
the society to duplicate two tombs: the tiny, gold-painted chamber
of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamen, and the larger, beautifully
decorated tomb of Nefertari, powerful chief queen of warrior
Pharaoh Ramses II.
   They are among more than 400 tombs stretching for five miles
along the Nile River's western bank opposite ancient Thebes, now
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Saving both tombs has been a great worry for antiquities
officials.
   ``It's a wonderful project, the answer we've been searching
for,'' says Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization. ``Now we can save our tombs without depriving our
tourists of their beauty.
   ``And if we have to close one or more of them for restoration
and conservation, we won't feel so bad about it.''
   Tawfik says tourists still will be allowed in the original
tombs, but he expects the replicas ``to deflect masses away from
endangered ones.''
   Not even Egypt's mightiest kings foresaw that their secret
burial chambers, carved in valleys so desolate they were unfit for
the living, one day would attract a tourist boom of monumental
proportions.
   But they do. Each day 3,000 to 5,000 people crowd the land of
the dead, even in the horrendous heat of Upper Egypt's summer.
Humidity, dust and salt brought into the tombs by sweaty bodies and
the touch of countless fingers are eating away at the timeless but
fragile decorations on their walls.
   The only sure way to save them would be politically and
economically explosive: bar tour groups from the most popular
tombs. Most visitors travel in groups, carried across the Nile by
special launch and bused to the various valleys of death. Only
about two dozen tombs are open to the public at any one time.
   Permanently closing the tombs is an option that's hardly figured
in years of debate over monument conservation because of a national
push to bring ever more tourists into Egypt.
   Some 2 million visitors now pump $2 billion a year into Egypt's
dollar-starved economy. The government predicts the number of
tourists will double within the next few years.
   For antiquities officials, whose job is to protect relics,
copying the best and most endangered tombs offers an acceptable
alternative to locking doors. It leaves room for tourist expansion.
   Also, the replicas will be tombs with a difference. Tourists
will see them as the ancients did, not the faded and damaged
chambers visited today. And with modern touches: one-way traffic
and air conditioning.
   Abt, a Zurich psychoanalyst, says engineers have selected the
bone-dry, fault-filled Western Valley for the reproductions, lying
just over the hills from the tombs of Tutankhamen and fellow
pharaohs.
   The Western Valley was chosen because of ``its beauty and
emptiness. The sacred atmosphere so important to early tomb
builders is something we don't have to duplicate,'' Abt says.
``It's already there.''
   The West Bank's most popular tourist spot is the Valley of the
Kings, where New Kingdom rulers were buried for 500 years.
   But ancient architects originally gave the royal nod to the
Western Valley, where they placed the mummy of pharaoh Amenophis
III in 1353 B.C. The area later was abandoned in favor of valleys
to the east and south.
   Abt says plans call for the first cluster of duplicate tombs to
include, in addition to Tutankhamen's and Nefertari's, those of the
warrior Pharaoh Tuthmosis III and two non-royals, Sennedjem, a
court official, and labor foreman Inherkhau.
   He estimates each cluster will cost as much as $80 million,
raised in a campaign like the 1960s UNESCO drive that saved the
monuments of Abu Simbel and other Nubian sites south of Luxor.
   Abt says duplicate tombs will be low-slung, built to disguise
their locations and decorated by Egyptians using techniques of the
ancients. Originally, tombs were dug into the landscape to hide
them from would-be robbers after the riches accompanying the dead
pharaoh into the afterlife.
   ``Each cluster will be built against the mountains and covered
with rocks to give the same feeling of antiquity as the ancient
tombs,'' Abt says.
   To ensure that each tomb will be correct historically, the Swiss
group's 50 international members include as vice president an
authority on the West Bank burial grounds, Basel professor Erik
Hornung.
   While new in Egypt, building replicas to save antiquities is not
a new concept.
   French officials closed the Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963
after 100,000 visitors surged in the previous year to see the
monuments' prehistoric paintings. In 1983 a facsimile was opened,
which today awes 400,000 visitors annually.
   Spain currently is seeking money to reproduce 12,000-year-old
wall paintings of bison and horses at its Altamira Caves. The
tourist crush in the main cave became so great in 1982 that it too
had to be closed.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - For generations the Aleuts of Alaska's Pribilof
Islands sustained themselves by hunting seals. Then five years ago
the government banned seal hunting, bringing an end to a way of
life. Today there is new hope that the sea once again will provide
a livelihood for the people of the Pribilofs.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No longer allowed to hunt seals, the
natives of the Pribilof Islands are looking to the vast fishing
grounds of the Bering Sea to revive a floundering economy.
   The key to that revival is a new $58 million harbor that was
dedicated in August.
   ``I wouldn't have come back before, because it was so hard to
find a job,'' said David Shane, a 23-year-old Aleut who left St.
Paul as a teen-ager to finish his schooling. ``The opportunities
now are enormous.''
   Shane returned last year to work in St. Paul's new crab plant,
in a building formerly used to process seal hides.
   When federally managed seal hunting was halted here in 1985,
Pribilof Island villagers were faced with building a new economic
base or seeing their community dissolve.
   Located in the heart of the booming Bering Sea fishing grounds,
and closer to many of the stocks than bigger Dutch Harbor, St. Paul
is betting its future on fishing.
   The success of the new harbor depends partly on whether three
local entities - the city, the TDX Native corporation and the
tribal council - can cooperate on economic development.
   But residents are optimistic.
   ``This has been a struggle for freedom and independence,'' says
TDX chairman Ron Philemonoff. ``We are free, and with the harbor
here, we will soon be independent - financially independent.''
   Aleut seal hunters were settled on the Pribilofs forcibly by
Russian fur traders in 1820. When the United States bought Alaska
in 1867, the islands quickly were designated the nation's first
wildlife refuge, and the government contracted the seal harvest to
private companies. In 1910, it assumed administrative duties
itself, withdrawing in 1983.
   The government banned commercial sealing in 1985 because of
declining seal populations. It set up a trust to help islanders
make the transition to an independent, harbor-based economy.
   Alaska commerce commissioner Larry Merculieff of St. Paul said
the islanders' seal-harvesting history denied them independence and
unfairly saddled them with the blame for harming the animals.
   ``They labeled our gentle people as brutal, bloodthirsty,'' he
said. ``But we understand that the Aleut way is to produce answers,
not tears.''
   During the harbor dedication, over the rumble of an idling motor
of a visiting ship, Orthodox Bishop Gregory of Sitka blessed the
harbor and the villagers, sprinkling holy water on the sea, the
dock and the worshipers.
   The new harbor is small - about 10 acres of moorage and 300 feet
of docks - and can't accommodate ships longer than about 300 feet.
Big factory trawlers will anchor outside and take skiffs in for
supplies.
   With its small clinic and airfield, St. Paul already was a
temporary stop for some ships, which traveled on to Dutch Harbor to
process their catch.
   But Dutch Harbor, the nation's busiest fishing port, is swamped
by ship traffic. It also is more than 20 sailing hours from St.
Paul.
   And more ships keep entering the arena.
   An estimated 2.4 billion pounds of bottom fish, valued at $200
million, were harvested in the eastern Bering Sea in 1989, local
officials said. Nearly 90 percent of Alaska's crab harvest, valued
at more than $182 million, also comes from there.
   Local officials expect between 500 and 1,000 fishing vessels to
call at St. Paul each year.
   Many processing and service companies are looking for a toehold
in what some dub the ``mini-Dutch Harbor.''
   Pribilof Islands Processors' crab plant already is operational
and eventually could process 150,000 pounds daily. A $50 million
surimi plant being built by Saint Paul Seafoods is set to open Jan.
1 with a capacity of 400 metric tons daily.
   ``We're ready to come in - we're just waiting for an
invitation,'' said Dick Pace, president of UniSea, a Seattle
fishing and processing firm building a $75 million surimi plant in
Dutch Harbor.
   Surimi is a reconstituted fish paste that can take many
different forms, such as fish sticks, imitation crab, fake lobster.
It's a relatively new idea, cashing in on some generally
unattractive fish, mostly bottom fish such as pollock.
   Japan imports a lot of surimi and a great deal - particularly
the imitation crab - is sold in the United States.
   UniSeas wants to build at least one crab plant hiring 190 people
in St. Paul, Pace said. But local officials say development has
been slowed by disagreements between the city, TDX, which owns most
of the land, and the tribal council.
   ``The city's been talking with virtually every major producer,''
said city manager Vern McCorkle. ``We're expecting them to take up
additional negotiations with the village corporation.''
   A variety of Dutch Harbor service companies are looking at
expanding to St. Paul, said Dutch Harbor mayor Paul Fuhs, who has
helped put together business tours to the smaller community.
   Both communities' fates are closely tied to the changing
fishery, which some fear is in danger of depleting stocks.
   When the 1976 Magnuson Act ``Americanized'' the fishery by
creating an exclusive economic zone and extending U.S. jurisdiction
to 200 miles off the U.S. coast, fishermen scrambled to fill the
void left by foreign trawlers.
   An estimated 1,900 U.S. vessels operated in the bottom fish and
crab fisheries off Alaska in 1989 - more than 700 in the eastern
Bering Sea, local officials said.
   ``This is an enormous resource - the last of the great fishing
grounds,'' Shane says.
   And Paul Shebolin, a city worker carrying his 11-month-old son,
Moisey, on his back, said change may be slow but it is inevitable.
   ``This is going to be his home,'' he said of the baby. ``We're
building something for the future - something the children can fall
back on.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Across the land, preservationists are trying to
block the developers' bulldozers and among the main arenas in this
conflict are the plantations and battlefields of Virginia. It's not
enough just to save the sites, preservationists argue, but to
preserve the historic integrity of the surrounding areas as well.

   From George Washington's Mount Vernon
to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, from Yorktown to Appomattox,
preservationists are fighting to save Virginia's rich vistas and
historic heritage.
   Their foes are those who want to build modern homes, factories
and office buildings alongside Civil War battlefields and
18th-century plantations.
   ``What Virginians have done very well is to save the houses
where Jefferson and Washington have slept and ate,'' says Carter
Hudgins, director of the Center for Historic Preservation at Mary
Washington College in Fredericksburg. ``It's easy to save those
things which are one of a kind.
   ``The more difficult thing is to go the next step and save the
surrounding land, which puts the site in perspective. If you lose
the setting, you lose the context. You lose the meaning of what the
world was all about to begin with.
   ``It's very, very difficult to get people to understand that
anyone who goes to visit Monticello will have an experience that's
diminished dramatically if they stand on top of Thomas Jefferson's
mountain and gaze on the rear end of condominiums.''
   Virginia's preservationists don't stand alone.
   Across the nation many historic sites are threatened by
development and neglect, says Peter Brink, vice president for
programs and services at the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in Washington.
   For example, in South Pasadena, Calif., a proposed six-mile
freeway would cut through five National Register historic districts
and destroy 1,500 homes.
   ``To an extent, we are seeing more potential conflicts between
preservationists and developers, especially on the East Coast and
West Coast, because of the type of urban sprawl that is
happening,'' Brink says. ``What's needed is a way to plan
development, channel it so it doesn't obliterate the countryside.''
   Preservationists also need to plan ahead so they are working to
control development before the bulldozers are rolling, he says.
That is happening now at Antietam National Battlefield Park in
Maryland, much of which is still privately owned.
   Historic sites are often saved by, not in spite of, developers,
Brink says.
   ``Three-fourths of the time, we consider ourselves partners with
developers,'' he says.
   In January, officials at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville dropped plans to swap land at the base of
Monticello Mountain so a large office complex could be built on the
site.
   People in Stafford County have debated whether the land
adjoining George Washington's boyhood home should be zoned for
commercial use.
   In Culpeper, Va., California developer Lee C. Sammis has
acquired 5,200 acres along the Rappahannock River on land where the
Battle of Brandy Station was fought in 1863. Historians have
described that as one of history's last great calvary battles.
   Sammis has offered for public use 242 acres that a historic
consultant deemed significant to the battle, says Michael Armm,
development director for the project called Elkwood Downs. The land
offered is connected by trails.
   Armm agreed that ``there has to be some perspective,'' a buffer
around the property. But some critics complain that ``if you stand
on the site and look around, you shouldn't be able to see anything
that wasn't seen from the battle,'' he says.
   ``Some kid a hundred years from now is going to get interested
in the Civil War and want to see these places. He's going to go
down there and be standing in a parking lot. I'm fighting for that
kid,'' says Brian Pohanka, a local historian. He was one of
hundreds protesting the plans on the 127th anniversary of the
battle in June.
   It's too late for some places.
   Factories spew smoke across the James River from Shirley
Plantation in Charles City County. Last year, 53,500 tourists
visited the plantation built in the 1700s. A subdivision has been
built downriver from the factories.
   Trees planted across the river in Chesterfield County have
helped some to obscure the sight, says Charles Carter, whose family
lives on the plantation.
   ``Tourists are dismayed. I have had more than one group of
English folk who said, `We'd never allow this.'
   ``Once the historic integrity of an area has been affected, it
doesn't go back the other way.''
   In Waterford, residents concerned about development inching west
from Washington formed a compact and are raising money to buy
property. They have asked farmers who own the land surrounding the
town for the right of refusal when they sell their land, says
Katherine Ladd, director of the Waterford Foundation. The compact
and its negotiations with developers led to Waterford being removed
from the National Trust's list of endangered historic places.
   Would-be restorers of historic property can take advantage of a
rehabilitation tax credit, which allows a one-time federal income
tax deduction of 20 percent of the federal income tax up to $7,000,
Brink says.
   In Virginia, the Threatened Property Fund, created in 1988,
provides $500,000 a year to help restore and save historic
properties, says David J. Brown, executive director of Preservation
Alliance of Virginia, and director of the fund.
   The money is used to create a revolving fund to buy properties
and resell them and to buy easements that restrict what a later
owner could do with the property.
   The state also allows localities to freeze real estate taxes on
historic property at a lower level.
   ``These kinds of incentives and credits encourage people to go
ahead and take those risks,'' Brown says.
   ``It's not feasible to save them all.''

   Burt Reynolds says it was his own vision of
how he would like to live if he wasn't an actor that brought about
creation of the CBS sitcom ``Evening Shade.''
   Reynolds had been living in Florida with his wife, actress Loni
Anderson, and their son, Quinton, and was looking for a comedy
about a family in a small Southern town. That brought him to Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason of ``Designing Women.''
   ``Linda wanted to do something about Arkansas because she's from
a little town in Arkansas,'' Reynolds says. ``I wanted to do comedy
with somebody special. When the word got out that I wanted to do
half-hour comedy a lot of people responded. I talked to a lot of
people, but the projects didn't excite me as much as hers, because
hers was about a family in a small Southern town. Which is exactly
the way I'd like to raise my son because I grew up that way.
   ``She asked me what I'd be if I couldn't be an actor. I said a
teacher or a high school football coach. That's the way the
character evolved.''
   Reynolds, best known for hit movies such as ``Smokey and the
Bandit,'' ``Hooper'' and ``The Cannonball Run,'' plays Wood Newton,
a former pro football player who returns to his hometown in
Arkansas with his wife and three children to coach the high school
football team.
   Marilu Henner plays his wife, Charles Durning is his best friend
and Ossie Davis is the philosophical owner of a barbecue stand and
the show's narrator. It also stars Hal Holbrook as his
father-in-law and Elizabeth Ashley as an eccentric aunt.
   ``Wood's a very family-oriented man who has a wonderful sense of
humor about himself,'' Reynolds said during a rehearsal break at
CBS-MTM Studios. ``He loves small town values. His team's not
winning because he doesn't have any material, and in Arkansas
winning is very important in football. He's not real happy about
that, but he has three wonderful kids and his wife is about to have
another one.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason also suggested that Reynolds try his hand at
a script.
   ``I've done a lot of rewriting,'' he says. ``I'd like to very
much. The blank piece of paper just scares me. I admire people who
can sit down and stare at it and do something.''
   In Florida, Reynolds had starred for two years in the ABC
Mystery Movie ``B.L. Stryker.''
   ``The show worked, but it was the wrong night,'' he says. ``We
were in the top 20 until ABC moved us from Monday to Saturday. The
decision to move it to Saturday was suicide. When they did that I
hit the ground running. I started telling people I'm ready to do a
half-hour comedy.''
   For 16 years Reynolds concentrated on making movies before
returning to television. His first TV appearance was in
``Riverboat'' in 1959. He was in ``Gunsmoke,'' and later starred in
``Hawk'' and ``Dan August.''
   After ``Deliverance'' in 1972 made him a bankable movie star, he
became a box-office champion with such hits as ``The Longest
Yard,'' ``Smokey and the Bandit,'' ``Semi-Tough,'' ``Hooper,'' and
``The Cannonball Run.'' But his last hit was ``Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas'' in 1982, and his movies slumped at the box
office after that.
   Part of the slump can be attributed to rumors that he had AIDS,
which made it difficult for him to get cast in good movies.
Actually, he had injured his jaw doing a stunt and it developed
into temporomandibular joint disorder. It caused an inner ear
problem that affected his balance and it made eating so difficult
he lost a lot of weight.
   ``For two years I couldn't get a job,'' he says. ``I weighed 145
pounds. I had to take five physicals to get a job. I had to take
the pictures that were offered me. I did action pictures because I
was trying to prove that I was well. I did pictures like `Malone,'
`Heat' and `Rent a Cop.'
   ``I've never been so brutalized by reviewers. I got criticized
and beat up like crazy. They said I was washed up, my career was
over. I went to television because I had to. I'll be back. I'll be
back on my terms.''
   Reynolds says he has no fear of taking roles that cast him as an
older man. He played a 65-year-old safecracker in ``Breaking In.''
   ``I don't care as long as the parts are good whether I play
somebody's father or grandfather. It's a question of whether you're
working. If you're working it doesn't matter.''

   ``Les Miserables'' makes more than just money.
The long-running musical hit helps build careers.
   Since it first opened on Broadway in 1987, the show has given
nearly a dozen mostly unknown performers a chance to play the
leading role of Jean Valjean.
   In New York and around the country, 10 actors have portrayed the
heroic Valjean, starting with Colm Wilkinson, who originated the
role in London in 1985. Wilkinson was followed by country singer
Gary Morris, the best-known among the Valjean replacements. The
rest, in subsequent tours and extended stays in cities like San
Francisco, have not been household names.
   The part is currently being played on Broadway by Craig
Schulman, and he assumed the role in the classic show business
style. Schulman went from the chorus of the musical's first touring
company to eventually starring in the Broadway edition of the show.
   The performer first encountered ``Les Miserables'' in October
1987 when he was hired as an understudy and as a member of the
ensemble of the first national company. He was in the chorus for
only three months when he took over the lead on tour. Last January,
Schulman graduated to the Broadway production.
   And the show has led to more offers to sing opera, another of
Schulman's amibitions.
   `` `Les Miserables' is an opera as far as I'm concerned,''
Schulman said the other day in the star dressing room backstage at
the Broadway Theater. ``I'm not doing anything different from what
I've been training and aspiring to do, although I get to show off
my acting skills more in this show.''
   So what does he call himelf - an opera singer who does musical
theater or a musical theater performer who does opera? He's not
sure, but is happy performing in both worlds.
   ``Casting people and producers really do want to pigeonhole you
into a particular type or a particular category,'' Schulman says.
``I had four months off last fall to sing Hoffmann in `The Tales of
Hoffmann' at Virginia Opera and the production was very, very
successful.''
   Schulman always wanted to be a performer, although he didn't
know where he was headed.
   Schulman's first theater job when he hit New York from Long
Island in September 1979 was with the Light Opera of Manhattan, a
small troupe specializing in Gilbert and Sullivan. The pay was low,
the conditions primitive but the experience invaluable. When
Schulman left two years later, he had done some 650 performances.
   ``It was wonderful training,'' he recalls. ``It was the kind of
place where you realize after a time that if you can work there
under these conditions you can work anywhere for anyone and
survive.''
   Schulman left for a tour of ``The Merry Widow.''
   ``You've heard of bus-and-truck tours,'' he says. ``This was
just a bus, and we played everything from high school gymnasiums to
real theaters, working with a minimum of scenery and whatever
lighting was available. It was 55 cities in 10 weeks.''
   He did meet his future wife, Monica, on the tour. They were
married in 1983 and now have two sons.
   ``I decided that operetta was a lot of fun but knew that I
wasn't going to make a full-time living at it,'' he says. ``And I
didn't see myself as a song-and-dance man for shows like `Chorus
Line' or `42nd Street.' ''
   He settled down to study opera, while working at a temp job and
an occasional opera role with small companies.
   ``I did my first `La Boheme' for $250 for two weeks of rehearsal
and three performances,'' he says. ``I also learned a lot about
supply and demand in this business. The producers wound up bringing
in a harp player who was paid $500.''
   Schulman also auditioned for training programs in opera,
becoming an apprentice at the Chautauqua Opera near Jamestown, N.Y.
He felt he needed the extra training because, at age 27, he was
getting into opera later than most people.
   In June 1987, he auditioned for ``Les Miserables,'' which had
opened on Broadway four months earlier.
   He got the job in the touring company but was undecided,
particularly since he had an offer to sing in ``Manon'' in
Virginia.
   ``I took a chance on `Les Miserables,' '' he says. ``I knew that
eventually there would be a bus-and-truck tour, and I knew there
was going to be a Los Angeles company and I knew that eventually
they would need replacements for the Broadway company.''
   He was on the road for nearly two years, leaving the tour in
early September 1989 with the guarantee he would open on Broadway
the following January. He has been there ever since.
   ``The hardest part about this role is maintaining discipline
about living my life for the next performance. It's a very
difficult role. Because of my training and my background, it
doesn't hurt me to do it but I need to get a lot of rest and not do
a lot of anything else.
   ``I get home each night and I go right to bed. There's a
cardinal rule in our house: Nobody wakes Dad until Dad is ready to
get up.''

   Carmakers are packing more punch under the hoods
of their 1991 cars and trucks and are wrestling with ways to
persuade America's drivers to use it wisely.
   The hundreds of new models that U.S., Asian and European
automakers will be showing off late this year and early next year
are aimed at the U.S. love affair with power on the highway.
   Perhaps the longest-awaited entry into the U.S. market is
General Motors Corp.'s Saturn car. The car i due in showrooms in
October or November, but GM kept the lid on preview peeks at the
vehicle.
   It's expected to be priced somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000
and compete in the thickest part of the market. GM officials have
said they expect that 80 percent of Saturn's sales will come from
traditional import buyers.
   But analysts say that remains to be seen.
   Increased power in 1991 cars comes despite rising fuel prices
stemming from the Middle East crisis. Actually, they say, cars have
made great strides in fuel-efficiency since the last big oil crunch
of the late 1970s.
   Ford Motor Co. officials, in fact, like to brag that the Lincoln
Continental of today gets just about the same mileage as the Ford
Pinto of 1979, a gas sipper of its time.
   But with more power, automakers also are finding that safety
sells, too. Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca has appeared on a
series of television ads along with accident survivors who thank
the company for installing air bags in all of its North
American-made cars.
   The ads say little, if anything, about air bags being
supplemental safety devices, designed to work in conjunction with
seat belts.
   Along with air bags, and all in the name of safety, new cars
have automatic seat belts, beefed up door structures to absorb more
shock in a side impact, and traction control systems to deter
skidding.
   Mercedes-Benz, in fact, has a system that puts on the brakes
automatically if the car's wheels begin to spin.
   Nearly all automakers are bragging about more power in their
vehicles' engines. In some cases, usually with large, luxury cars,
that comes from simply larger engines like the engine for General
Motor Corp.'s Cadillac De Ville and Fleetwood, which goes to
4.9-liter from a 4.5-liter.
   Trucks, too, are getting more powerful. The Dodge Dakota pickup
gets a 5.2-liter V-8 for 1991, the first V-8 in a pickup its size.
   More often, though, the extra horsepower is coming from the
growing number of multi-valve engines. These are power plants with
four valves per cylinder instead of the traditional two. Such
technology, coupled with more efficient fuel delivery systems,
boost horsepower while reducing fuel consumption.
   The 5-series of BMW cars have the same size engine for 1991 as
it did for 1990 - a 2.5-liter, six-cylinder model - but with the
addition of more valves per cylinder, horsepower is boosted to 189
from 168.
   Another way to boost power from the same size engine is to add a
turbocharger, which boosts air compression entering the engine. But
turbochargers produce higher engine temperatures which can speed
engine wear.
   Pontiac has dumped turbochargers from its entire 1991 line. The
3.1-liter Turbo engine has been replaced by a 3.4-liter V-6.
Horsepower rises to 210 from the turbocharged engine's 205.
   While the cars of the coming year have the capacity to go faster
quicker, automakers also are equipping more with sophisticated
systems to stop them.
   Anti-lock braking systems, called ABS in the industry, can add
hundreds of dollars to the price of a car. But industry watchers
say ABS is an extremely important safety feature which will
probably be standard equipment on all cars some day.
   Most drivers north of the Mason-Dixon Line know that it's best
to gently pump the brakes when slowing down on slippery pavement.
ABS systems do that for the driver.
   Sensors detect when wheels are beginning to lock and send
signals to the braking system to pulse pressure in the brake lines,
in effect pumping the brakes and avoiding a slide.

   But all the new technology, whether it's under the hood, at the
wheel or in the passenger compartment, costs money and consumers
will see it.
   Prices for 1991 models, announced through mid-September, will
rise somewhere between 1 percent and 5 percent, depending on
manufacturer and model.
   Perhaps the least expensive car on the market for 1991 is the
Yugo GV Plus, a Yugoslav import with a base price of $4,435. With a
little bit of hunting, a consumer can find a car that cracks the
quarter-million-dollar mark, too.
   But these days, seeing a new price doesn't necessarily mean a
carbuyer will actually pay it.
   Incentives still are lurking around, and manufacturers are
finding it hard to get out of the money-back business. Basically,
automakers use incentives to spur sales. But to some degree,
consumers demand it.
   One auto executive gave an example of how crazy the system has
become. He said that someone who wouldn't touch a car with a
$12,000 price tag would be more likely to buy one listed at $13,000
and carrying a $1,000 rebate.
   Manufacturers issue consumer incentives, which they advertise
heavily, and dealer incentives, which receive little notice. With
dealer incentives, manufacturers let dealers decide for themselves
how to spend the money. It may go for increased advertising, prizes
in salesperson contests, or may be passed along to the consumer.
   It pays consumers to shop around, even after they've decided on
exactly the car they want. Going to different dealers representing
the same manufacturer for the same car can result in some savings.
   Consumers also can save money by purchasing options in packages.
And for 1991, there are options and gadgets galore.
   Chrysler has redesigned its popular minivan for 1991 and has
included not only a cup holder but a juice-box holder. Other
options include power everything: mobile phones, leather seats and
door panels, a compass and double bright neon green windshield
wipers.
   Here are summaries of what's new for 1991 from the nation's Big
Three automakers, being unveiled this fall. Many makers of imported
cars introduce their 1991 lines later in the year.
   GM: The company's best-selling division, Chevrolet, is offering
a newly designed Caprice sedan and wagon. Its sisters are the Buick
Roadmaster wagon and a sedan, which will be introduced later.
   GM has restyled the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird for
1991 and the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency Elite and Touring
Sedan.
   FORD: The company introduced its 1991 Ford Escort and Mercury
Tracer subcompacts and Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle earlier
this year. Elsewhere, the company is upgrading the powertrains in
some of its most popular vehicles, including the Ford Thunderbird,
Taurus and Mustang and Tempo along with the Mercury Cougar, Lincoln
Town Car and Continental.
   On the truck side, there are new sport models of Ford's popular
F-series full-size pickups and Ranger compact pickups.
   CHRYSLER: The struggling automaker has redesigned the interior
and exterior of its popular minivan, whose sales make up nearly
half of all minivans sold in the United States. The company also is
selling its Dodge Stealth sports car, which was engineered by
Chrysler's principal Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   The company is marketing stripped-down versions of its Dodge
Shadow and Plymouth Sundance cars, call the America series, as
stopgaps for a hole left when the Chrysler gave up on its Dodge
Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts last February.

   Automakers are finding that safety sells.
   For years, U.S. automakers have resisted following their
European cousins by shying away from advertising safety devices in
their cars. That's changing.
   U.S. government regulations have caused a big part of the switch
by requiring passive restraint systems, such as air bags or
automatic seat belts, on the driver sides of all U.S.-built cars
beginning with the 1990 model year.
   Chrysler Corp. has taken the lead among U.S. companies in
promoting safety features, especially air bags, which it supplies
as standard equipment in all of its North American-made cars.
   ``Initially, it was tough getting customers to talk about
safety,'' Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tony Cervone says. ``It becomes
a discriminating factor in buying a car now.''
   Chrysler is devoted part of its ``Advantage: Chrysler''
advertising campaign to testimonials by survivors of crashes saying
they owed their lives to air bags.
   General Motors Corp. recently announced it will equip all
U.S.-built passenger cars with driver's-side air bags by the fall
of 1995, but the company has yet to work them into safety-related
advertising.
   Company spokesman Donald Postma says the upscale Cadillac
division is expected to be the first to promote air bags.
   Ford Motor Co. has air bags in about half its 1990-model
U.S.-built vehicles, but the company doesn't go to lengths to
promote them or motorized passive restraint seat belts.
   Under federal law, all cars made in the United States after
Sept. 1, 1989, must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt
for drivers and front-seat passengers.
   According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Arlington, Va., air bags were equipped in 1 percent of the
estimated 10 million 1987 model domestic and import cars sold in
the United States. By 1996, 90 percent of cars are expected to have
air bags, the institute says.
   European carmakers Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen long have
incorporated safety promotion into advertising, in part because
buyers ask more questions.
   ``When you deal with a small market niche such as ours is in the
United States, you have to be very attentive to what customers say
they want in a car,'' says John Chuhran, a spokesman for
Mercedes-Benz of North America in Montvale, N.J.
   In one 30-second television commercial, Mercedes, which sells
about 75,000 cars a year in the United States, promotes its
standard safety features.
   ``Of course you want a safe car for your family. But what is
safe? Well, only your authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer offers (a) .
. . system with driver's-side air bag and anti-lock brakes on every
new model. Standard. That's safe,'' the announcer says.
   An air bag, usually concealed in the steering wheel, inflates
within a tenth of a second upon a head-on impact or one 30 degrees
to the left or right of center of the car. Air bags are devices
designed to be used in addition to lap and shoulder seat belts.
   Automakers acknowledge that air bags add no safety margin to
side or rear impact accidents.
   ``In terms of advertising,'' says Mercedes-Benz's Chuhran,
``safety is a relative term. There is no such thing as an
absolutely safe automobile.''

   Imagine yourself behind the wheel of your powerful new
automobile, speeding along the Autobahn at 80 miles an hour.
   That fantasy can become reality through various overseas
delivery plans offered by European auto manufacturers, including
Volvo, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Audi, Volkswagen and others.
   You order a European-made car from your local dealer, travel to
Europe to pick it up, and drive it around during your vacation
before having it shipped home.
   European cars cost about 10 percent less in their countries of
origin. The difference in price, plus savings on auto rental in
Europe, might cover the cost of a European vacation or business
trip.
   For example, you'll pay $20,931 for a 1990 Audi Quattro
five-speed sport sedan if you pick it up in West Germany, compared
to the $22,800 list price in the U.S. Mercedes-Benz will offer you
a top-of-the-line 560 SEC sports coupe at $73,350, compared with
the $81,500 U.S. price tag. The company estimates that if you
rented the same car for a month, you'd pay $5,600.
   Some U.S. dealers offer deep discounts almost equalling European
prices, but they can't match travel incentives.
   Overseas delivery plans, offered only to U.S. residents, require
customers to order and pre-pay before leaving for Europe,
personally pick up cars (with documents and passport in hand) and,
within a specified time period, ship cars home to local dealers,
where cars can be picked up eight to 10 weeks later.
   A key attraction is getting the most appealing make and model.
But with varied overseas delivery plans, there are added factors to
consider.
   Most plans cover factory preparation, short-term registration,
service and insurance in Europe (which may be extended up to one
year at additional cost), inland shipping from dropoff points to
port, conversion to U.S. standards (emissions and white instead of
yellow head lights, for example), ocean freight, marine insurance,
U.S. documentation fees, customs clearance, and shipping to your
dealer. U.S. duties may or may not be covered, so it's worth
checking.
   Some plans provide free or discounted trans-Atlantic airfare,
hotel accommodations, meals, maps, trip-planning services, and
other incentives to sweeten the deal. One of Volvo's plans provides
one free ticket on SAS to Gothenburg, Sweden, with a second ticket
available for $499 round trip. BMW and Mercedes-Benz also offer
discounted airfares to Munich and Stuttgart, respectively.
   All three manufacturers provide an overnight stay in a luxury
hotel, with continental breakfasts and luncheons, or rest and
shower facilities at delivery centers. Purchasers also get factory
tours.
   Some manufacturers have one pick-up point; others have several,
some with additional charges. Similarly, numbers and locations of
drop-off points for export vary.
   BMWs must be picked up at Freimann Delivery Center, about 20
minutes by taxi (BMW pays cab fare) from Munich, but they may be
dropped off at 19 places in 11 countries. Mercedes-Benz delivery is
at Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart, but there are 28 free drop-off
points around Europe.
   Volvo's Gothenburg center gives free car ferry transport from
Sweden to Germany, Denmark or England. Or, at additional cost,
Volvos are delivered at a dozen centers throughout continental
Europe and Great Britain. Free drop-off points are at Gothenburg,
Antwerp or Bremerhaven, with 20 additional European drop-offs at
additional charge.
   Volkswagen's various centers deliver different car models:
Vanagon at Hannover, Jetta and Passat at Wolfsburg, Cabriolet and
Corrado at Osnabrueck. Peugeot delivers cars to Paris airports.
Alfa Romeo delivers near Frankfurt to avoid Italian auto
registration red tape.
   Manufacturers require different lead times. Two weeks to a
month's notice is usual. Mercedes-Benz tries to accommodate
last-minute shoppers, while Porsche (delivered at Zuffenhausen,
near Stuttgart) needs a year's lead. With sufficient time, cars are
prepared to specification. Otherwise standard vehicles are
available.
   Before buying, comparison shop through local dealers for the
make, model and plan that suit your needs.
   Enjoy the Autobahn, but remember that when you get home, it's
back to a safe 55 mph on U.S. roads.

   The days of wild swings in gasoline prices are
just a Mideast crisis away. During the first three weeks of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, gasoline prices rose an average of a
penny a day.
   Consumers who can't reduce their driving and plan to keep their
current car for a while still can cut fuel costs by using a little
common sense and spending a little time on their vehicle.
   One of the best ways to conserve gasoline is to organize a
driving route before starting out. If planned carefully, a driver
can avoid backtracking which wastes gasolineand time.
   Also choose a time of day when traffic is lightest to avoid
getting involved in any fuel-wasting traffic jams.
   The United States Auto Club of Dallas says trips of five miles
or less make up 15 percent of the driving in the United States and
consume 30 percent of all fuel.
   Planning also pays off when getting ready for a trip. The less
packed into the trunk, the less weight the car has to haul. Try to
avoid rooftop loads which increase wind resistance and gobble fuel.
   Proper maintenance of a vehicle also can save gallons of
gasoline. Keep tires inflated to recommended pressures, be sure the
air filter is clean, keep the engine tuned and change oil according
to the manufacturer's recommendations.
   ``When a car needs maintenance, it typically will use 5
(percent) to 25 percent more gas than when it's well-cared for,''
says Ken Lehman, chairman of the Car Care Council in Port Clinton,
Ohio.
   Once on the road, motorists can get more miles per gallon by
driving sensibly. The U.S. Auto Club and vehicle manufacturers
offer these fuel-efficient driving tips:
   - After starting the car in cold weather, let it warm up no
longer than 30 seconds. When driving with a cold or cool engine,
avoid sudden accelerations if possible.
   - Allow the car to idle for no more than a minute or two.
Waiting in a drive-in bank line or at a railroad crossing with a
long train crawling by can eat fuel needlessly.
   - Avoid quick accelerating or braking.
   - Use the same foot to control the accelerator and the brake,
which would eliminate the possibility of ``riding the brake.''
   - Drive at steady speeds whenever possible.
   - Use the air conditioner for highway driving but turn it off
and open the windows at lower speeds. According to General Motors
Corp., air drag created by open windows at 50 mph or more can cause
more fuel consumption than the extra gas used when an air
conditioner is on and windows are closed.

   One of the major costs and one of the most
confusing issues for any motorist these days is insurance.
   When choosing or updating an insurance policy, dozens of
questions can come up: How much coverage is enough? How can I
reduce my rates? Should I change my insurance carrier?
   One of the best ways to cut your insurance costs is to drive
carefully. AAA Michigan says being ticketed for running one stop
sign and being at fault in one accident during a three-year period
can boost rates by 40 percent.
   The car that's being insured also has a big effect on premiums,
says Greg Vartanoff, actuarial director for AAA Michigan, one of
the state's largest automobile insurers. A family car will be
insured less expensively than a sports car.
   ``A 1990 (Chevrolet) Lumina has a base price of around $12,000
but it's insured as a $10,000 vehicle,'' he said. ``A 1990 Camaro
IROC has a base price of about $14,000 but it's insured as a
$30,000 vehicle.''
   Another way to cut insurance costs is to shop around. Insurance
laws sometimes change, which can affect the amount you pay. Changes
in levels of coverage or deductibles, for example, can raise or
lower your premiums.
   Perhaps the only time a motorist actually looks over an
insurance policy is at new-car buying time. Along with sticker
shock at the dealership, a driver may be shocked to discover
changes in insurance costs.
   New cars cost more to insure than old cars simply because
they're worth more.
   But many of today's cars come with safety features that can
slash insurance costs. Air bags, automatic seat belts and anti-lock
brakes can cut them too, sometimes by considerable amounts.
   Anti-theft devices such as alarms and stolen-vehicle tracking
systems also can save some money in some states.
   ``If you have an active device that requires some sort of manual
action, you get a 5 percent deduction in comprehensive coverage,''
Vartanoff said. ``A passive device, you can get a 10 percent
deduction.''
   He said one of the easiest ways to reduce costs is to increase
deductibles, or the amount of money a customer is willing to pay
for vehicle repairs before insurance money kicks in.
   ``If you increase the comprehensive deductible from the
mandatory $50 to $200, you save 15 percent,'' Vartanoff said, ``and
to $250 deductible, it would be up to 30 percent.''
   Here is a brief vocabulary of car insurance terms. Some forms of
coverage are mandatory, others optional. Check with state laws.
   - Liability coverage. Divided into two subcategories, bodily
injury and property damage. Bodily injury, in turn, is divided into
two groups - per person and per accident - with dollar limits to
each. This bodily injury coverage is frequently referred to as
20-40, for example, meaning $20,000 limit per person and $40,000
limit per accident. Property damage liability is listed on a per
accident basis also with limits. States establish minimum liability
coverages.
   - Uninsured motorists. Covers your injuries caused by an
uninsured motorist. Limits also are on a per person and per
accident basis.
   - Collision. Protects the vehicle up to its market value.
Deductibles are paid by the policy holder. The higher the
deductible, the lower the premium.
   - Comprehensive. Protects the vehicle against mishaps other than
collision, such as fire, theft, flood and so on. Deductibles also
are common in comprehensive protection.
   - Car rental. Provides financial help for a motorist who needs
to rent a car while his own is being repaired.
   - Death indemnity. Provides a one-time payment to the estate of
the policyholder or spouse when an accident results in death.
   - Property protection. Protects the policyholder for damage to
another vehicle when the policyholder is negligent, provided the
other car does not have collision coverage.

   Entrusting an $18,000 car to a teen-ager streaked with axle
grease is, perhaps, a motorist's worst nightmare short of an
accident.
   Choosing a mechanic to keep a car in top running order is a
difficult task for the average car owner.
   Everyone has heard horror stories featuring technical
mumbo-jumbo like: ``The chuga-chuga you're hearing is coming from
the double-backflip overwhammy assembly. It needs a new
razzenhelter and that'll cost you about 300 bucks.''
   Anxiety can be dispelled by making a few telephone calls, taking
a quick glance on a repair shop's walls and asking some questions.
   Before you take your car to an unknown fix-it shop, check with
friends to see where they take their vehicles. It's best,
obviously, to find someone with a car like yours - at least from
the same manufacturer.
   There are a growing number of repair ``boutiques'' specializing
in a particular part of a car, such as the exhaust system,
suspension or transmission. These can be a good bet for repair
work.
   Many of these shops are located in shopping-center-type strips.
According to Car Care Mall News, about 1,200 of these centers are
operating in the United States and Canada, and the number is
growing.
   After you've selected a shop, whether a specialty or a general
repair one, check for certification of the business and the
mechanics working there.
   The American Automobile Association periodically checks the
businesses it certifies, and mechanics can qualify for
certification through the National Institute for Automotive Service
Excellence.
   A mechanic must have two years' experience before ASE
certification is possible. The organization holds tests twice a
year nationwide which determine whether a technician will be
certified.
   A written certification is not a guarantee that a mechanic is
competent, but it indicates that the technician has passed an
examination.
   Before work is performed, it's best to insist on a written
estimate of the problem and its expected cost. Many states require
such an estimate. When major repairs are involved, get several
estimates, something an insurance company may require anyway.
   After the work is done, inspect the parts that have been
replaced and have the mechanic explain what went wrong. Again, some
states require that shops offer the consumer the old parts.
   Finally, closely examine the bill to be sure that all costs -
parts and labor - are itemized.

   The federal government is cracking down on
phonies in the automobile repair business - not the grease monkeys
who pretend they know something but really don't, but the
replacement parts mechanics put in your car.
   Automakers have complained that the bogus parts not only rob
them of about $3 billion a year but could cause severe accidents.
   Federal officials have said some of the fake parts they've
discovered include some high-volume ones such as oil filters, brake
pads and shoes and antifreeze.
   The danger, they say, is that because repairs or maintenance
involving these parts is so routine, a consumer may not check to be
sure that the parts are exactly what should be going on or into the
car.
   During the past year, the FBI staged a 15-state raid on dozens
of businesses, looking for counterfeit General Motors Corp. parts.
   Some of the parts that have showed up in the past included oil
filters with rags jammed into perforated food cans and brake
linings made of compressed wood chips and cardboard.
   To combat the problem, GM has been testing the use of holograms
on packages of its genuine parts. A consumer sees a mirror-like
square on the outside of the box that shows a multi-color GM logo
when turned slightly.
   Making and marketing counterfeit parts is a federal offense
through trademark infringement.
   New York attorney Milton Springut said there are four basic ways
trademarks are violated:
   - Repair shops claim they are authorized by of associated with
an auto manufacturer.
   - Used-car dealers portray themselves as authorized dealers for
a particular manufacturer.
   - Parts are sold in packages containing counterfeit or
look-alike trademarks of the automakers.
   - Unlicensed parts are sold with the manufacturer's trademark.
   There is nothing wrong with making or selling a replacement part
for a particular vehicle as long as that part doesn't pretend to be
from the original manufacturer.
   For example, there's nothing wrong with selling a fan belt made
by the fictitious XYZ Corp. for a particular Dodge car as long as
the XYZ Corp. doesn't try to pass itself off as Dodge Division of
Chrysler Corp.
   Automakers have trademarks on a variety of materials and often
go to court to protect them. For example, a company was barred by a
court from making a Rolls-Royce-looking grille and flying lady
emblem for Volkswagen cars, Springut said. The court ruled that the
company violated Rolls-Royce's trademarks on its grille and emblem.

   You've just paid about $75 for that snazzy
clear-coat finish on your new car, and it's so deep looking that
you think you could stick your hand into the hood before touching
metal.
   So with good reasons - investment and pride - you want to keep
the car looking new even after it's had a year of getting beat up
by sun, sand and snowy slush.
   There are three basic ways of keeping your car clean:
   - Do it yourself and spend the better part of a summer afternoon
getting a little damp but taking the time to be sure the vehicle is
really clean.
   - Run it through a professional car wash in a fraction of the
time but with less personal satisfaction.
   - Take it to your favorite fund-raiser in a parking lot
somewhere, with a bunch of kids intent on soaking each other turned
loose on your $18,000 pride and joy with high-pressure water,
unknown solvents and sometimes questionable ability.
   It may not be much of a choice, but it's a necessary evil.
   A well-kept car has a higher resale value, and some people
insist that a clean car runs better than a dirty one. But sometimes
the best of intentions to keep a car looking spiffy can produce
disastrous results.
   Car wax and polish makers have some advice for keeping a car's
luster through the years for people who like to do it themselves.
   Through the years, paint oxidizes as it's exposed to air. Waxes
and acrylic ``clear-coat'' finishes protect the paint from
oxidation, which can dull the color.
   Non-abrasive waxes are best for new or relatively new finishes,
especially ``clear-coat'' ones. They help clean surfaces and bring
out the shine in a finish.
   If a wax with abrasives is used on a new ``clear-coat'' finish,
it can scratch the acrylic, dulling the finish and leaving tracks
of your cloth.
   After the car turns a year old, Turtle Wax Inc. recommends, a
regular wax containing cleaners can be used. The cleaners strip
away oxidation, allowing wax to cover and protect the paint.
   Folks who prefer to take their vehicles to commercial car washes
should ask what kinds of soaps, solvents and waxes are used. The
International Carwash Association says its members use soaps milder
than those normally used in at-home washings, use less water than
driveway washes and dispose of dirt- and soap-laden water according
to environmental regulations.
   It also says participating car washes change the mixtures of its
soaps and additives to match the time of year - more bug lifters in
the summer and more salt dissolvers in the winter.
   Everyone agrees that the most important time to wash a car is
right after rain or snow storms, when it may have picked up
sulfuric acids and road salts that can damage its finish.

   You're driving down a lonely highway at night not
long after a snow storm. The road appears to be clear of snow, but
suddenly, without warning, your car begins sliding sideways as it
hits a patch of ice.
   What to do?
   All driving instructors and manufacturers say the first rule is
not to panic. Sure, easy, right?
   Perhaps the best way to avoid panic and get the car back under
control is to go through a quick mental checklist and take
immediate, but gentle, actions.
   Saab-Scania AB, the Swedish automaker, has published a book,
``Winter Motoring,'' with all kinds of tips for wintertime driving.
The Swedish get a lot of practice driving in snow and ice, so the
recommendations are based on wide experience.
   If your car's rear wheels are the ones skidding, steer the front
wheels in the direction the rear wheels are going. In other words,
if the rear of the car is skidding toward the driver's side, steer
left.
   It doesn't matter if your car is front- or rear-wheel-drive for
this maneuver.
   At the same time, push in the clutch on a standard transmission
or ease up on the gas pedal on a car with an automatic
transmission. After the rear wheels stop skidding, gently turn the
steering wheel back to bring the front wheels to point straight
ahead.
   Here's where the difference between a front-wheel-drive and a
rear-wheel-drive pops up.
   On a rear-wheel-drive car, the rear wheels may begin to skid in
the other direction. Chances are the skid won't be as severe, so a
driver needn't turn the steering wheel as far the other way to slow
the skid. Remember, use gentle turns.
   On a front-wheel-drive car, a skid in a new direction isn't
nearly as likely if the initial correction was done carefully.
   After the skid stops, slowly release the clutch or gently
depress the accelerator so the engine speed matches the road speed.
Accelerate gradually.
   Front-wheel skids are far less common and less difficult to
control. Saab recommends that the driver not move the steering
wheel.
   Depress the clutch pedal on a car with a standard transmission
or ease up on the accelerator on a car with an automatic
transmission. Since the front wheels are skidding sideways, they
perform a kind of braking effect by themselves.
   Wait for the front wheels to grip again and when they do, gently
steer the car back on track. Slowly release the clutch or gently
depress the accelerator to get going again.
   After everything is under control again and your heart returns
to its normal pace, slow down a bit. Then, when you accelerate,
brake or steer, do it gently - no sudden starts or stops or quick
turns.
   Remember that going too fast for conditions was the reason the
car began skidding in the first place.

   The worst enemies of automobile tires are underinflation,
out-of-balance wheels, and bad driving habits.
   Being aware of these problems can lengthen the life of your
tires, according to experts at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
   ``Tires should be inflated to the pressure recommended by the
manufacturer of your car,'' advises Frederick J. Kovak, vice
president of tire technology of the Akron, Ohio-based company.
``The most important part of tire care is air.''
   An underinflated tire generates excessive heat which reduces
fuel economy and increases tread wear in the shoulder area, the
company points out, adding that inflating your tires to - but not
over - the maximum inflation pressure specified on the tire
sidewall can improve fuel economy and extend tire life.
   If the car is carrying extra weight, such as luggage on a
vacation trip, a little additional air should be added to the tires
- preferably four pounds over the car manufacturer's recommended
cold tire pressure.
   Out-of-balance wheels definitely can rob tires of thousand of
miles, Goodyear notes.
   ``For a tire to run true, weight of the tire and wheel assembly
must be distributed uniformly,'' Kovak cautions. ``A heavy spot in
the tire and wheel assembly must be counterbalanced by
precision-made wheel weights.
   ``Improper balance could lead to `cupping' and excessive wear of
the tread at the heavy spot. The tread will eventually cup out to
the point where the tire will no longer be usable.''
   Driving habits can shorten the life of tires, Kovak says. Some
handling advice:
   - Don't speed. (``Excessive heat is generated from the flexing
of the tire's carcass when driven at high speeds. This heat
increases the rate of tire wear and reduces the tire's
durability.'')
   - Avoid fast turns on curves and around corners, fast starts and
panic stops, riding on the edge of the pavement, and driving over
curbs, chuckholes or other obstructions.
   Also recommended for automobiles and light trucks is tire
rotation at 6,000 to 8,000 miles and again at 18,000 to 24,000
miles, unless the vehicle manufacturer advises otherwise.
   ``Rotation a couple of times during tire life usually will mean
more even treadwear, particularly for front-wheel and
four-wheel-drive cars and light trucks,'' notes Fred Caraway,
Goodyear's manager of product service.
   Basic rotation technique involves a simple ``X'' pattern, he
explains.
   On front-wheel-drive vehicles, the left rear tire goes to the
right front and the right rear tire to the left front; front tires
move straight to the rear. The reverse applies to rear-wheel-drive
vehicles.

   History buffs are running out of gas in
their quest to buy a rare, 92-year-old three-wheeled automobile
they view as a monument to two Peoria men they consider the fathers
of the American automobile.
   After two years of unsuccessful fund raising, the Bring Home the
Duryea Committee has shifted gears in a desperate bid to prevent
the 1898 Duryea Motor Trap from being sold to Japanese collectors.
   The committee is trying to raffle off a new, $56,000 Cadillac
Allante to save the luxury car's vintage ancestor: the Duryea Trap,
which was built in a Peoria barn nearly a century ago and
originally sold for $1,200.
   The group is selling 100 chances, at $1,000 each, for an Oct. 6
drawing.
   ``We've raised $70,000, and we need $125,000 by Nov. 1, or we're
going to lose the car,'' said John Parks, a leader of the effort to
save the Duryea Motor Trap, built in Peoria by Charles Edgar Duryea
in 1898.
   ``It's frustrating because this car will be lost forever if we
don't raise the money,'' Parks said. ``People don't seem to be
excited about it, maybe because we've paid so little attention to
history in Peoria over the years.''
   The Trap was the brainchild of Duryea, who, with his brother, J.
Frank Duryea, in 1893 built the first American gasoline-powered
automobile, now in the Smithsonian Institution.
   About 12 Traps were built in the Peoria area in 1898-90. Just
two remain, and one is in the Henry Ford Museum in Greenfield
Village, Mich. The other is owned by L. Scott Bailey, founder of
Automobile Quarterly Magazine.
   Bailey has offered to sell the car to Peoria. But after two
years of work, the committee is far short of its goal.
   ``Mr. Bailey has had offers of $250,000 from Japanese collectors
for the car, and I think he regrets agreeing to sell it to us,''
Parks said. ``But he really believes it belongs back in Peoria.
   ``We do too, but it's been hard to get people interested in this
project. It's not something that pulls at your heartstrings. Maybe
we've been poor at approaching people.''
   Parks criticized the Peoria Historical Society for failing to
assume leadership in the project.
   ``I'm disappointed that a lot of different organizations haven't
been more active. Area car dealers have shown very little interest.
I thought they'd be a natural group to help us,'' Parks said.
   ``And the Peoria Historical Society, as a group, has done
nothing for us. We hoped some benevolent person in the community
would want their name on this forever and step forward to become
our major contributor. But that hasn't happened, either.''
   Dorothy Sinclair, who retired two months ago as the Historical
Society's director, defended her group's role in the project.
   ``It would be most unfortunate if we lost it,'' said Mrs.
Sinclair, a member of the Peoria City Council.
   ``But, in my opinion, it has not been a well-thought-out
fund-raising campaign,'' she said. ``I don't think they have
approached the right people to get the money.
   ``It's not too late. I think it could still be done if the right
people get involved.''
   Mrs. Sinclair said the society operates on a small budget and
lacks the resources for the Duryea project.
   Tom Leiter, the society's president, called the criticism
``highly inappropriate.'' He said his group is ``firmly behind the
project.''
   ``The problem raising money is that some people don't care about
antiques,'' Leiter said. ``Some view this as just an old car. They
don't get very excited about it. It's not fair to criticize people
because they have other priorities.''

   If you're boiling mad or upset about
something, the last thing you should do is get behind the wheel of
your car.
   Rolling down the road in an attempt to release pent-up emotions
and frustrations is tempting but dangerous, says Dr. George
Guthrey, clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of
Oklahoma.
   ``With all the power associated with the automobile, even the
most frail person can become a raging dynamo when he or she gets
behind the wheel of a powerful car,'' he says. And if you're
driving while sad or depressed, your concentration and thinking are
impaired, he adds.
   Deal with your emotions by going for a walk or a jog, he
advises. Or move into another room, watch television or call a
friend.
   If driving is necessary, have a definite destination planned,
such as the grocery store or fast-food restaurant. But not the
neighborhood bar.
   Traffic itself may instigate anger, but Guthrey points out that
it doesn't do any good to get riled about something you can't do
anything about. ``Instead of attempting to provoke someone who has
cut in front of you, keep your emotions in check and give them a
friendly wave of the hand instead.''

   As a driver, you shouldn't overlook maintenance of two of your
most vital safety devices: your eyes.
   While you may have passed your licence bureau's eye test, some
subtle but important vision problems may have gone undetected, says
the American Optometric Association. Getting a more comprehensive
professional examination won't force you to give up driving, the
organization says. Rather, it will assure that you will drive more
safely.
   Some things that your optometrist or opthamologist will assess:
   - Distance vision. While most states require 20/40 visual
acuity, the measurement is made when you are standing still. When
you're in a moving car, your acuity can change.
   - Night vision. You can't see as well at night, and your accuity
may drop from 20/40 to 20/60 after dark. You also must be able to
adapt quickly to potential blinding effects of oncoming headlights.
   - Depth perception. You need to be able to judge precisely the
distance between your car and those in front or back of you on the
road and those approaching from other angles.
   - Peripheral awareness. This means your ability to detect
objects and movement at the sides of your focal path. It's
essential to spot pedestrians and other vehicles, and it helps you
keep in the proper lane.
   - Focal change. You should be able to switch your focus quickly
between the road and dashboard and back again.
   - Color perception. Obviously, you need to recognize traffic
signals and signs by color as well as shape. But color also adds to
your perception of people, objects, and other cars.

   Americans like to drive - but they could be better at it,
according to a recent national poll of motorists.
   Eighty-one percent of the 500 licensed drivers taking part in
the survey said they liked to drive, while only 16 percent said
they disliked or hated driving.
   But not one of the drivers managed to answer correctly all 10
questions put to them on basic driving situations. The average
number of correct responses was five.
   Drivers age 16-24 answered an average 5.7 of the 10 questions
correctly, while those 35 and older got 4.8 right.
   The most irksome habit of other motorists was their failure to
use turn signals, according to 24 percent of the poll respondents,
who cited other bad habits such as cutting off or pulling in front
of the driver, 19 percent; driving too slowly, 12 percent; and
tailgating, 12 percent.
   New York was cited as the city with the nation's worst drivers,
followed in order by Los Angeles, California in general, Boston and
Chicago.
   Thirty-six percent (55 percent female, 45 percent male) said men
are better drivers than women, 28 percent said women are better,
and 32 percent insisted sex makes no difference in driving ability.
   The poll, with an error margin of plus or minus 4-6 percentage
points, was conducted by Fleishman-Hillard Research of St. Louis
for Valvoline, Inc., a Kentucky-based automotive products company.

   A car owner with a service problem or a question wants a real,
responsive human being to talk to, and fast. Ford Motor Company has
centralized its Customer Assistance Center in Detroit with the aim
of picking up 95 percent of its customer phone calls within the
first few rings.
   ``The move to centralization with one toll-free phone number for
customers across the country was done for only one reason - to
improve customer satisfaction,'' says Al White, owner relations
operations manager. Owners of Ford, Mercury and Lincoln cars can
call 1 (800) 392-3673 when they have a problem or question.
   White says that the center receives about 5,500 phone calls and
1,000 letters a day. These are handled by customer service
representatives who have undergone four weeks of training covering
a history of the company, basic automotive systems, warranty
policy, computers, interpersonal skills and stress management. -
   The light truck is one of the fastest growing categories of
vehicles on the road, and they're likely to be owned by dedicated
automotive do-it-yourselfers, according to a survey in Automotive
Marketing, an industry magazine.
   The publication says that most owners who do DIY work on their
light truck, van and utility vehicles are male baby-boomers between
24 and 44 years old who earn more than $30,000 a year. More than a
quarter have at least some college education, and a third live in
the ``Old South'' states.
   According to the study, most of them begin personalizing their
new vehicles right away, installing such items as bedliners,
running boards, exterior accessories, cap-camper tops, seat covers
and auxiliary lights.
   Forty percent of all owners of these vehicles consider
themselves ``down and dirty'' DIYers who aren't afraid to replace a
radiator or transmission themselves, the magazine reports. -
   The l'art et l'automobile gallery is presenting an international
group show until Oct. 27, saluting the pioneer automotive artists,
according to gallery owner and founder Jacques Vaucher.
   The gallery, located on East 34th St. in Manhattan, is devoted
exclusively to automotive art in paintings, sculptures and
drawings. -
   Looking for a gift for that special love of your life, your car?
   Auto-Shade Inc., creator of the sunglasses design on the auto
sunshade, the folding corrugated board for car windshields, now
offers the Magic Shade, a two-piece nylon fabric sunshade, and
Sun-Spot, a reusable plastic sheet that blocks out glare by
adhering to windows by static cling. -
   If you're old enough to remember the first T-birds or if you're
young enough to have kids who play with toy models, you might like
the 1955 and l956 FordThunderbirds interpreted at an 18th of their
original size by Revell.
   Models of both cars come with opening hoods and doors and
functional steering wheels, with detailed chasses, interiors and
V-8 engines matching the originals. -
   Your teen-ager may be resistant to advice, but a new pamphlet,
``How to Survive the Teenage Driving Years,'' lays some basic
safety facts on the line that may hit home with him:
   - More teens are killed by car crashes than by any other cause,
and most of these deaths occur during the nighttime ``cruising''
hours.
   - Almost a third of all male teen-age drivers killed in motor
accidents were legally drunk at the time of the crash.
   - When accidents don't kill, they can seriously maim; each year
there are 180,000 cases of brain injury and 5,000 serious spinal
cord injuries resulting from automobile accidents.
   The pamphlet, developed by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,
tells how teens can resist peer pressures that lead to the lethal
mix of drugs or alcohol and driving. And how simple measures like
seat belts can increase their chances of surviving to become former
teens. For a copy, send a stamped self-addressed envelope to
Liberty Mutual -TDAP, P.O. Box 777, Boston, Mass. 02117. -
   Jaguar, an American-owned British luxury automobile company,
faces a dilemma with the pronunciation of its name.
   According to Donald Petersen, chairman of the Ford Motor Co.,
which bought the British car-maker last year, Americans say
``jag-wahr,'' while the British pronounce it in three syllables,
``jag-yew-er.''
   The company says the average American buyer of the car - no
matter how it's pronounced - is 48 years old with a median family
income of $177,000 annually. Thirty-five percent of the buyers are
women. -
   Car safety features in today's automobiles did not begin with
the passage of federal legislation in 1966 but dates back more than
half a century, according to a professor at the University of
Southern Maine.
   In the 1930s, one automaker promoted a ``safety smooth''
dashboard with recessed knobs and switches, says history professor
Joel W. Eastman, author of ``Styling vs. Safety: The American
Automobile Industry and the Development of Automotive Safety,
1900-1966.''
   Another manufacturer, he notes, crashed cars into abandoned
gravel pits to show that the vehicle could withstand collisions.
   And Preston Tucker designed his unsuccessful Tucker model to
include seat belts, safety windshields that popped out on impact,
and collapsible front and rear ends. -
   A highway auto fix-up package designed to be a first aid kit for
cars is being marketed by a California-based company.
   The collection of car emergency necessities includes a tire
gauge, ice scraper, hubcap mallet, electrical tape, flashlight with
batteries, 6-quart water bag, trunk tie-down strap, tips on what to
do when your engine overheats and also a first-aid kit for humans.
   The items are contained in a compact 11x5x2-inch kit which can
be tossed in the trunk or under the car seat. It's $24.95 postpaid,
from Charles Burton Co., 7020 Deer Lake Drive, Sacramento, Calif.,
95823.

   Every so often, aides at the
Alzheimer's Center of Western Michigan replace the snapshots that
hang next to the doorway of each bedroom, gentle reminders to help
guide residents.
   Instead of substituting updated portraits, the aides tack up
photographs portraying the graying men and women in their youth.
   It is a clear sign of the devastating effects of the disease,
which first steals its victim's short-term memory.
   ``They remember themselves not as they are, but as they were,''
administrator Lynne Bylsma said. She stands in front of a room
whose occupant is identified by a photograph of himself as a
handsome World War II soldier.
   It is the same symptom that wipes out knowledge of children and
grandchildren, but leaves childhood memories intact.
   ``It's like a living death,'' Bylsma said. ``Sometimes, we have
to remove the mirrors in their rooms because they no longer
recognize the person looking back at them and it's upsetting to
them.''
   The center, which opened in April and accommodates 20 residents,
represents a trend in facilities that advertise as being designed
for Alzheimer's patients.
   Many experts say traditional nursing homes, often plagued by
space and staff shortages, are inappropriate for Alzheimer's
patients, especially those who are physically fit. The memory loss
is accompanied by increased irritability and a tendency to wander.
There have been accusations of Alzheimer's patients being strapped
down or over-sedated.
   It is widely believed that such patients fare better in more
intimate, homelike settings with specially trained staffs, safety
precautions and more individual attention.
   ``What you want is a place that can be flexible - that's not
going to take a cookie-cutter approach,'' said Deborah Beitler,
director of state policy and chapter advocacy of the Chicago-based
Alzheimer's Association.
   But as more facilities advertise as Alzheimer specialists,
patient advocates worry about potential abuses.
   Nobody knows how many such homes exist because there are no
licensing standards governing them, as there are with nursing
homes, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
   ``Pretty much anyone can put out a sign and call themselves an
Alzheimer's center,'' said Ann Steslicki, executive director of the
association's west-central Michigan chapter.
   The Alzheimer's Center in Grand Rapids is licensed by the state
as an adult foster care home. That means it can operate without
skilled nursing personnel but cannot treat patients requiring
extensive medical care.
   Sufferers of the disease, most of whom are over 65, sometimes
linger for decades as the disease progresses from forgetfulness to
loss of speech and bodily functions. An estimated 4 million
Americans have Alzheimer's.
   A private room at the center costs $2,500 a month. Insurance
rarely pays for such long-term care.
   The modern, one-sory building is part of a tree-shaded
retirement village.
   There is a fenced-in yard with a concrete path, and buzzers on
each door leading outside alert nurse's aides as residents come and
go.
   Pale carpeting in the spacious dining room is circled by a
bright red border, which residents are encouraged to walk to
relieve anxiety. The halls are color-coded to help residents find
their way.
   Staffing ratios are five residents per nurse's aide. A licensed
practical nurse is on hand during the day. There are memory therapy
sessions, daily exercise routines and field trips.
   Studies are under way to determine whether such activities help
to delay the most crippling stages of the disease.
   Shirley Leitz of Kentwood said she's impressed with the care her
77-year-old mother receives but is unsure about the benefits of the
specialized program.
   ``This place is so much more than having fencing in the yard,''
Leitz said. ``I appreciate that they encourage her to do as much as
she can by herself because once something is unlearned she won't
ever learn it again.''
   However, sometimes when Leitz visits, she finds her mother
wearing pajamas on top of her regular clothes or several layers of
blouses and pants.
   ``She is turning into a child,'' Leitz acknowledges. ``It's hard
to think of the day when I'll walk in and she won't recognize me.''
   Until an accreditation system is created for Alzheimer's homes,
the Alzheimer's Association urges caution for families seeking care
for a relative with the disease. The association provides guidance
to consumers about what to look for.
   While adult foster-care homes have relatively low supervision
standards, many retirement villages and senior citizen centers that
are not regulated at all have also begun advertising as Alzheimer's
units, officials say.
   ``We know that some people out there are going to be primarily
motivated by profit and will prey on families who are under a
tremendous amount of stress and particularly vulnerable,'' said
Beitler of the Alzheimer's Association. ``There definitely is that
fear on the consumers' part - and it's a justified one.''
   Janet Lewis, a supervisor for the Michigan Department of Social
Services' adult foster care licensing division, said the department
is limited in policing group homes because the department has no
Alzheimer's experts.
   ``As long as they don't advertise nursing care, they can call
themselves whatever they like,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, more nursing homes are setting aside beds or adding
wings designed for Alzheimer's patients.
   In 1987, 53,800 nursing home beds, or 3.3 percent of the
nationwide total of 1.6 million, were set aside for Alzheimer's
patients. By 1991, that number will almost double to about 100,000,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``Ultimately, our goal is to have all nursing facilities improve
to a point where they would be appropriate for Alzheimer's
patients,'' said Stephen McConnell, the association's vice
president of public policy. ``If you're taking good care of an
Alzheimer's patient, then you're probably taking good care of other
patients as well.''

<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Alzheimer's Homes, b2030</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When choosing a facility for an Alzheimer's patient - a nursing
home or a group home - officials with the Alzheimer's Association
recommend that you call a local chapter or your community's agency
on aging for specific guidelines.
   There are 209 Alzheimer's Association chapters nationwide, with
at least one in every state, except Alaska. The national
headquarters may be reached by calling 1-800-621-0379.
   According to the group, relatives should review the facility's
reputation in the community and inspect the following:
   - Licensing. What sort of license does the facility have, and
what are the state standards for that? Try to find out about the
facility's owners.
   - Medical care. If the patient is in the later stages of the
disease or in need of extensive medical treatment, does the
facility have skilled nursing personnel? Are medical personnel on
call 24 hours?
   - Staff training, staff-to-patient ratios. Have staff members
been specially trained to work with Alzheimer's residents? A staff
ratio of four or five patients to one staff member is usually
sufficient.
   - Safety. Are residents allowed to go outside by themselves? If
so, is there fencing or some sort of deterrent to keep them from
wandering away? Full-time supervision is recommended.
   - Recreation, therapy, nutrition. Are there programs designed
for Alzheimer's patients to keep them active, productive and
physically healthy?
   - Is it easy for the patient to get around the facility or does
it have a confusing layout?
   - Is the facility affiliated with an university or research
organization?

   When Jack LaLanne opened the nation's
first health club during the Depression, he was labeled a charlatan
for promoting daily exercise and organic food.
   He didn't quit then, and he's not quitting now. At 75, LaLanne's
enthusiasm for health remains as solid as his sinewy physique.
   Time has leathered his face and his dark, wavy locks are
threaded with gray. Yet the firebrand of the physical fitness
revolution has the body of a man 20 years his junior and an
attitude that is ageless.
   ``I never think of my age, never,'' said LaLanne. ``I could be
20 or 100. I never think about it, I'm just me. Look at Bob Hope,
George Burns. They're more productive than they've ever been in
their whole lives right now.''
   Fellow muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger, chairman of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, credits LaLanne
with taking exercise out of the gymnasium and into living rooms
with his television show that was broadcast for some 30 years.
   ``He laid the groundwork for others to have exercise programs
and now it has bloomed from that black and white program into a
very colorful enterprise,'' Schwarzenegger said in a telephone
interview.
   ``Jack was first on my list to come to the White House'' for a
May 1 Great American Workout fitness party, Schwarzenegger
recalled. ``I told him, `I wouldn't celebrate this event without
your being here because you're responsible for everything that's
happened in the world of fitness.' ''
   LaLanne follows a daily routine that usually consists of two
hours of weightlifting and an hour in the swimming pool.
   ``It's a lifestyle, it's something you do the rest of your
life,'' said LaLanne, whose newest passion is golf. ``How long are
you going to keep breathing? How long do you keep eating? You just
do it.''
   He has built two gyms at his home nestled in a golden hill above
Morro Bay in central California. The one furnished with equipment
he designed 50 years ago could be considered a museum, said Elaine,
his wife of 31 years.
   The LaLannes moved to Morro Bay from their Hollywood Hills home
four years ago to escape smog-plagued Los Angeles. Their three-acre
plot includes a chicken coop, a greenhouse, an aviary with parrots
and parakeets, and a covey of statues - including David and the
Discus Thrower.
   In the garage is a curvaceous blue Corvette that LaLanne drives
when not jetting around the country preaching the gospel of good
health by way of lectures titled ``Sex at 70 - More Fun Than Ever''
and ``Don't Let Your Next Meal Go To Waist.''
   Mrs. LaLanne, 64, recently published ``Elaine LaLanne's Fitness
After 50 Workout'' and her husband has written six books promoting
a healthy lifestyle and is writing an autobiography.
   When the LaLannes met, Elaine was a chain smoker and a junk-food
junkie. She soon was transformed into a walking testimonial to the
LaLanne program.
   The couple has a 29-year-old son, Jon, who tends bar in Malibu.
Jack has a daughter from a previous marriage - Yvonne, 45, a
chiropractor - and Elaine has a son - Dan, 41, a forensic
photographer.
   Like his wife, LaLanne was not always the picture of health.
   The son of poor French immigrants, he was born in Oakland in
1914 and grew up to become a sugarholic, he said.
   The turning point occurred one night when he heard a lecture by
pioneering nutritionist Paul Bragg, who advocated the benefits of
brown rice, whole wheat and a vegetarian diet.
   ``He got me so enthused,'' LaLanne said. ``After the lecture I
went to his dressing room and spent an hour and a half with him. He
said, `Jack you're a walking garbage can.' ''
   Soon after, LaLanne constructed a makeshift gym in his backyard.
``I had all these firemen and police working out there and I kind
of used them as guinea pigs,'' he said.
   At 21, he opened the first of his 100 health clubs in
California, New Jersey and New York. He doled out $45 a month to
rent space on the third floor of an Oakland office building.
   ``The doctors were against me,'' LaLanne said. ``They said:
`Don't go to that Jack LaLanne guy or you'll get a heart attack,
hemorrhoids, you'll lose your sex drive. If you're athletes you
won't be able to throw the ball. And you women will look like men.'
''
   LaLanne began taking chiropractic lessons and giving massages to
pay the rent. He proved himself by taking on poorly conditioned
high school students.
   ``Word got around and everyone began saying how I took the kids
and turned them into superboys,'' he said.
   Eventually, his popularity grew and he had his own nationally
syndicated show. It aired from 1951 to 1971 and was brought back
for a few years in the early 1980s.
   Since then he has produced a couple of workout videos.
   The latest video assembled by both LaLannes is a commemorative
tape of four black and white vintage shows. LaLanne appears in his
trademark skintight jumpsuits, one of which is on display at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
   The fitness clubs now are owned by another company.
   When asked how he'd like to celebrate his 76th birthday on Sept.
26, LaLanne said he'd like to swim the 26 miles from Catalina
Island to Los Angeles under water. ``It's never been done.''

<HEAD>Group's Products Spark Reaction, Memories Among the Elderly</HEAD>

   A swatch of denim, a cowbell or a circus
poster may be all it takes to prompt memories that preserve the
past.
   ``It's talking about life. Memories need to be shared, whether
good or bad, and we should listen to what (elderly) people have to
say and why it's important,'' said Kathryn Leide, who with her
partner have developed kits intended to stir up the past and stir
the recollections of older men and women.
   Their kits cover such themes as county fairs, the Depression,
the home front, farm days, school days, work life, train rides and
aprons.
   The kits, described as a multisensory, multimedia approach to
reaching the elderly and others, contain videotape cassettes,
slides, song books, fabrics, scent cards and items such as
rationing stamps, sports pennants, old train schedules and circus
posters.
   Ms. Leide and Lynne Erickson organized their non-profit
corporation, Bi-Folkal Productions Inc. of Madison, about 14 years
ago. They sell or rent about $300,000 worth of kits a year.
   They first sold the kits to libraries, then expanded to nursing
homes, prisons, colleges, state hospitals and day care centers
around the country.

   Dick Countryman practices square-inch gardening.
Except for a few, necessary paths, his 30-by-50-foot backyard is in
nearly year-round production of vegetables and flowers.
   Plants in containers also fill most nooks and crannies and an
enclosing, 6-foot wall supports climbers.
   ``There's no road map. Wherever and whenever I have room to
plant something, I do it,'' he says. ``I don't believe in allowing
ground to go fallow.''
   Countryman feels his garden proves it isn't necessary to have a
large plot to grow a constant supply of fresh vegetables and cut
flowers. He's been cultivating it more than 25 years. Now 64 and
retired, he thinks it's a shame more people - particularly retirees
- don't grow vegetables and flowers.
   ``The big thing is to work at your own pace and avoid
disappointment by first learning and then following the basic
techniques,'' he says. He advises beginners to ``start small and
don't try to do everything at once'' and estimates a 4-foot by
8-foot vegetable garden is enough for one person's needs.
   An August visitor counted at least 70 varieties of flowers,
about half of them in bloom. There were more than 40 types of
vegetables. The vegetable count lumps as one type five varieties of
tomatoes, six of peppers, three of cucumbers, three of garlic,
three of onions and three of squash. There were even 24 stalks of
sweet corn.
   ``I like pretty flowers. I like nutritious, fresh vegetables. I
like to experiment. A lot of things I grow just to see if I can
grow them,'' Countryman says by way of explanation.
   His theory is to keep the ground in constant production.
   ``It's also moving the plants around, crop rotation, so you
don't build up any diseases.''
   While there are perennials, such as a strawberry patch, most
plants are pulled out as soon as they complete their cycle.
   ``I might go in here with mutiplier onions, or I might go in
there with head lettuce or flowers, or whatever,'' he says.
   The 100-square-foot strawberry bed always has been in the same
place. Runners are used from time to time to replace older plants,
of course. The bed produced berries (Ozark Beauty and Sequoia) from
December into July this year.
   Flowers are just as likely to follow vegetables as vegetables to
follow flowers, but the bulk of the vegetable production - because
of the desert climate and triple-digit summer temperatures in this
Phoenix suburb - begins in the fall.
   He has few worries about frost.
   ``I can cut a fresh bouquet of flowers or gather fresh
vegetables every day of the year,'' he says.
   While the intensive approach may seem unorthodox, Countryman's
credentials are impeccable. He retired recently as assistant
director of the state Horticultural and Agricultural Commission, is
a horticultural graduate from the University of Arizona, and is in
frequent demand as a speaker on gardening subjects.
   ``Preparation of the planting bed is the secret,'' he says. ``Do
it right, and you'll have a reasonable amount of success.''
   For 100 square feet, he covers it 4 inches deep with organic
matter, such as mulch, and sprinkles two pounds of ammonium
phosphate (16-20-0) and five pounds of gypsum on top before turning
it in twice. The gypsum is used to counteract salt in local water.
Gardeners in other areas may find lime or soil sulphur work better.
   Countryman seldom uses chemical pesticides, finding that insects
and diseases rarely bother healthy plants.
   His planting beds are arranged so the watering bubbler system
applies two inches uniformly every four days much of the year.
   ``Adequate water and healthy plants keep weeds to the minimum,''
he says.
   He has plants in more thsn 200 pots. They range from miniature
roses to chives to cucumbers to raspberries.
   His potting mix formula is based on an ancient wheelbarrow with
1 cubic foot capacity. He starts with 4 inches of horse manure from
a nearby riding stable and mixes this with a gallon container of
perlite, a gallon of vermiculite, a cup of bonemeal, two cups of
gypsum and a gallon of any commercially sold potting mix.
   The front yard is mostly flower beds and shrubs, but it does
include 100 square feet of lawn grass. ``That's plenty of lawn to
take care of,'' he says.

<HEAD>Travel Guide for Getting Around with Arthritis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A free booklet has been published to help the 37
million people who have arthritis travel a little easier.
   The ``Guide to Traveling with Arthritis'' provides tips on
dealing with airlines and other transportation providers as well on
how to feel more comfortable while on vacation.
   ``A lot of older people, especially those with chronic ailments
such as arthritis, tend to not travel in the belief that they'll
just be miserable,'' said Gene Malott, publisher of the monthly
newsletter ``The Mature Traveler,'' and a consultant for the guide.
``It doesn't have to be that way.''
   The guide suggests travelers talk to their doctors before
planning a vacation.
   Among the other tips:
   - Pack lightly.
   - Consider weekday traveling to avoid crowds. When flying,
request aisle seats, which are easier to get in and out of.
   - Consider the climate of your destination. Humid, high heat can
be uncomfortable for some people with arthritis.
   The guide is available free by writing: ``Ansaid Tablets Guide
to Traveling with Arthritis,'' Box 307-A, Coventry, Conn., 06238.
The guide was produced by The Upjohn Co., maker of the drug Ansaid.

   General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
reached tentative agreement early today on a new three-year
contract covering 300,000 workers in 29 states.
   ``I'm just delighted we got this contract settled without a
disruption,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said in announcing the
agreement, reached after a 41-hour bargaining session between the
union and the world's No. 1 automaker.
   Details of the agreement were withheld until they could be

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in August,
the government said. Analysts said the first report on Americans'
spending since the Persian Gulf crisis indicated growing consumer
caution - but not panic.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that overall sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted $149.2 billion, down from $150.0 billion in
July and the largest decline since sales fell 1.0 percent in April.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Industrial production fell 0.2 percent in
August, its worst performance in four months, the government said
in a report analysts said was another indication the manufacturing
economy remains locked in lethargy.
   The manufacturing economy had been sluggish long before Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, growing a meager 1.5 percent over the last
year, the Federal Reserve said Friday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush sent Congress a bill to forgive
some Latin American debt and to encourage more U.S. companies to
invest there. Aides said he also was readying a bill to allow the
lowering of trade barriers with Mexico.
   The Mexican free-trade measure could be submitted as early as
Monday, when administration trade officials testify before the
House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, sources said Friday.
   Bush would like to have the authority to lower trade barriers
with Mexico in hand when he meets with President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari in Mexico City in November.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A United Airlines workers group announced they
were ending an agreement with an investment partnership to acquire
the carrier's parent, UAL Corp.
   But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Friday, the worker group, United Employment Acquisition Corp., said
it was still interested in acquiring the Chicago-based airline.
   The disclosure, which came after the markets had closed Friday,
ended an agreement between UEAC and Condor Partners LP in April to
help UEAC, a company formed by United's unions, acquire UAL.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate cleared the way for action on a
bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase fuel
economy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Friday he
hoped to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 mpg by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day once they are fully in
effect, but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure
on the Senate floor.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The chairman of the House Banking Committee
described some government sales of failed savings and loans in late
1988 as ``a giveaway'' and said many of the deals should be
renegotiated.
   The Bush administration's top banking official said Friday that
the government is considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale
contracts but does not intend to break them.
   Investigators for the committee said in a report that outside
investors in troubled thrifts received $78 in assets and
government-granted benefits for every $1 of capital they put up to
buy the institutions.

   LONDON (AP) - A dry summer and the Middle East crisis have
driven Britain's annual inflation rate up to 10.6 percent, the
highest rate in more than eight years, the government reported.
   The latest inflation rate, reported Friday, is 0.3 percentage
points higher than the financial markets had expected, and is at
its highest level since February 1982, when it stood at 11 percent.

   MOSCOW (AP) - President Mikhail S. Gorbachev presented to the
national parliament an economic reform plan that proposes
market-oriented policies and other measures to halt the nation's
slide toward bankruptcy.
   But Gorbachev on Friday rejected the Russian parliament's
conclusion that the solution to the economic crisis requires
stripping the central government of much of its power. The
Gorbachev plan refused to surrender the Kremlin's power to tax or
give republics' laws superiority over national ones.
   Gorbachev's disagreement with the Russian parliament reduces
hope of a national consensus by the Oct. 1 deadline set by the
president.

<HEAD>Not the Time to Cut Budget Deficits?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With members of Congress finally working hard to
achieve budget cuts, some of the very people who had urged them to
do so are having second thoughts.
   The very idea of cuts is so politically sensitive and
economically involved that some of these people speak only in
whispers. But what those whispers convey is that now might not be
the best time to cut anything but taxes.
   Events of the past several weeks have conspired to bring about
this newer attitude, events such as higher oil prices, additional
evidence of a decaying economy, a squeeze on household budgets and
a business credit crunch.
   The weakening economy now worries some of these people more than
continued budget overruns, in spite of their having made the latter
the biggest economic issue of the past year.
   The latest job figures have added to the concern. New job
creation has fallen abruptly. Unemployment is up, and monthly job
gains in private industry so far this year hav been off nearly 50
percent from the like period of 1989.
   Other reports show that the only parts of the economy still
growing vibrantly are health care and state and local governments,
and each of these presents problems of its own: inflation in health
care and bureaucratic growth in government, neither of them
designed for a healthy economy.
   But, ask the whisperers, is now the time to make cuts in
government spending? Or even to hold it down? If the private sector
economy is withering, what except government spending is available
to give it a nudge?
   Besides, it is said, no matter what Congress or the White House
or anyone else wants, spending isn't likely to come down when
billions of dollars are being spent on the military action in the
Mideast.
   In a announcement called ``StraightTalk,'' Conference Board
economist Gail Fosler states that military and economic
uncertainties, combined with high tax burdens, ``will prevent any
meaningful action in slashing the deficit.''
   Fosler comments that ``federal borrowing will surge over the
next two years regardless of what the administration and Congress
do to bring down the deficit.''
   Those who say Congress shouldn't even try to make the effort
aren't declaring their positions nearly as boldly. To do so would
brand some of them as turncoats because all year long they have
been advocating cuts.
   But, says one analyst of the economic scene, ``as the
Gramm-Rudman deadline of Oct. 1 draws near, the weakening economy
threatens to make these budget negotiations an academic
excercise.''
   That comment comes from John Wright of Wright Investors'
Service, who adds that ``clearly, in its current fragile state, the
U.S. economy can scarcely tolerate either higher taxes or
across-the-board spending cuts.''
   But it can hardly afford higher interest rates either, and until
Congress reaches some sort of agreement those rates are likely to
remain high. That much has been indicated by Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
   Not only does he remain committed to smaller budget deficits,
but he seems equally determined to forestall any drop in interest
rates until Congress reaches an agreement.

   Hundreds of longtime customers of Dayton
Hudson Corp. are tearing up their credit cards and threatening a
Christmas season boycott in a revolt over the retailer's snub of
Planned Parenthood.
   The credit card shreds began arriving by mail at Dayton's
downtown headquarters after the company confirmed on Labor Day
weekend that it was ending 22 years of financial support for
educational programs at Planned Parenthood of Minnesota. The
response prompted trustees of the Dayton Hudson Foundation to
reconsider their decision in talks with Planned Parenthood set to
continue this week.
   ``I don't think they expected any big outcry,'' said Toni
Tschann of the Minnesota Women's Political Caucus. ``And frankly, I
never thought I'd hear from this many. But people aren't standing
for it.''
   Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Ann Barkelew said several hundred
customers have returned their credit cards. On Saturday, about 500
people rallied outside a Dayton's store in suburban Edina where
they repeated their vow to boycott all Dayton Hudson stores
beginning the day after Thanksgiving unless funding is restored.
   Dayton Hudson, with 1989 sales of $13.6 billion, owns Dayton's,
Target, Marshall Field's, Hudson's and Mervyn's department stores
in 33 states.
   ``Dayton's has always stood with women,'' said Gloria Griffin of
the Minnesota Women's Consortium. ``Women are their customers. I
strongly feel this is only a momentary mistake.''
   Weighing in behind the irate shoppers is at least one big
investor and Bryn Mawr College President Mary Patterson McPherson,
who sits on the Dayton Hudson board of directors but is not a
trustee of the foundation.
   ``I am pleased they are reconsidering,'' said McPherson, who
declined to elaborate. She is an adviser at Women's Way, a
Philadelphia group that funds organizations that work in concert
with Planned Parenthood.
   ``The majority just feel that helping low-income teen-agers is
something that nobody should be afraid to do - especially
Dayton's,'' Tschann said.
   In 1946 Dayton Hudson began giving 5 percent of profits to
charities. In 1989 the company gave away $22 million and received
the America's Corporate Conscience Award from the Council on
Economic Priorities.
   ``When a company of the prestige and importance in the
philanthropic community says `no' to Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota, that is a devastating message to corporate America,''
Thomas Webber, executive director of Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota said. Webber said the proposed $20,000 grant is
financially insignificant compared to its symbolic importance.
   Many shoppers believe Dayton's withdrew financial support from
Planned Parenthood because the Christian Action Council of Falls
Church, Va., threatened to boycot Dayton's and other corporations
that fund Planned Parenthood.
   Barkelew said foundation trustees for years had considered
ending financial support to Planned Parenthood because many people
misconstrue the aid as support for abortion.
   But Barkelew said the company was having increasing difficulty
convincing people that the money was not used to fund abortions.
She said the foundation will continue to support other groups with
teen pregnancy prevention programs.
   Instead of freeing Dayton Hudson from the abortion debate, the
decision has had the opposite effect. The possibility of a boycott
from either side looms ust as the company enters the holiday
shopping season, which generates more than 50 percent of annual
sales.
   ``Our worst fears have been realized,'' said New York City
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, a trustee of city pension funds
holding $31.9 million of Dayton Hudson stock. ``We're long-term
investors and it's quite clear that when people get angry with a
company that can affect the bottom line.''
   Holtzman and Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's finance
commissioner, urged Dayton Hudson Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Kenneth Macke to continue funding for Planned Parenthood.
Denying the funding places Dayton Hudson ``squarely in the camp of
the anti-choice forces and in opposition to the overwhelming
majority of Americans who support accessible birth control,'' the
investors said in an Aug. 7 letter.
   Reatha Clark King, a spokeswoman for the General Mills
Foundation, said corporate gift giving decisions should be made
soley on the merits of published guidelines describing the goals of
a foundation.
   ``If you start evaluating your requests against special
interests, then you might sway from your purpose,'' said King,
whose organization gave $18,000 to Planned Parenthood this year.
   Barkelew said the company is ``confident a solution will be
reached,'' but she declined to say what steps are being considered.

   Bill Cosby may face a television challenge from
the Simpsons cartoon family this fall, but he leads all
entertainers in the money-making ratings, according to Forbes
magazine.
   Cosby topped the business magazine's list of the world's 40
richest entertainers with $115 million in estimated gross earnings
for 1989 and 1990. The magazine said Cosby made $60 million last
year and projected he would earn $55 million this year.
   In its Oct. 1 issue, released Monday, Forbes said the
53-year-old Cosby is making an estimated $4 million a month on
syndicated reruns of ``The Cosby Show.''
   Pop singer Michael Jackson, who hasn't released an album or gone
on tour this year, fell to second place after holding the top spot
for two years. Forbes said Jackson had two-year earnings of $100
million, $35 million of that in 1990.
   Jackson's singing sister, Janet, was a newcomer to the list,
ranked 26th with estimated two-year earnings of $30 million.
   The rock group The Rolling Stones - with $88 million - rose to
third place from eighth last year thanks largely to a big concert
tour. Movie producer-director Steven Spielberg, whose
``Arachnophobia'' was a box-office success this summer, made $87
million to slip to fourth place from second.
   New entrants on the list were the teeny-bopper sensation New
Kids on the Block in fifth place. Forbes said the group would make
$78 million in the two years, $61 million of it in 1990.
   Forbes said the estimated gross incomes were based on talks with
industry executives, lawyers, agents and managers. It said earnings
figures for recording artists are based on royalty payments from
record and video sales and estimated pretax gross for concert
tours.
   Rounding out the top 10 were television personality Oprah
Winfrey, $68 million; actor-producer Sylvestor Stallone, $63
million; pop singer Madonna, $62 million; bodybuilder and movie
star Arnold Schwarzenegger, $55 million; and Peanuts artist Charles
M. Schulz, $54 million.
   Newcomers to the list included former Beatle Paul McCartney,
with an estimated income of $45 million, thanks to a year-long
concert tour; actor Bruce Willis, star of the two ``Die Hard''
movies and of the December-release ``Bonfire of the Vanities,''
based on the Tom Wolfe novel, at $36 million; and actor Sean
Connery, who starred in the film ``The Hunt for Red October,'' at
$35 million.

   New gaps are opening between congressional and
administration bargainers at their budget negotiations as Democrats
back away from about $35 billion in proposed cuts to benefits
programs such as Medicare.
   The two sides planned a tenth day of meetings today at Andrews
Air Force Base in Maryland after a Sunday evening session ended on
a fractious note.
   ``Some of our members are wondering if they want an agreement,''
said a Republican official familiar with the talks. ``It doesn't
look good right now.''
   For the last several days, Democrats have expressed a
willingness to pare benefit programs by $125 billion from the
amount needed over the next five years to keep pace with inflation.
Differences over spending cuts have been considered one of the
bargainers' minor squabbles.
   But Sunday, Democrats told GOP bargainers that they could accept
a lesser cut of about $90 billion in Medicare, agriculture and
other benefit programs, said two officials who demanded anonymity.
   Among the proposed reductions they rejected was a Republican
plan to save $27 billion over the next five years by boosting the
monthly premium Medicare participants pay for doctors' coverage.
Under the GOP proposal, people with higher incomes would pay more
than the current $28.60 monthly fee.
   Reductions in benefit programs would be a crucial part of a deal
bargainers are trying to shape to shrink the federal deficit by $50
billion next year and $500 billion through 1995. These programs are
among the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and are one
of the prime targets on the GOP hit-list for savings.
   Major problems remain over taxes.
   Democrats and Republicans agree that the package should include
about $25 billion in new levies and fees for next year.
   Republicans, saying they want to spur the weakening economy,
insist that a cut in the capital gains tax rate be part of that
package. They say cutting the tax - paid on profitable sales of
property - would encourage more people to sell their holdings and
would increase government revenues.
   But Democrats say the proposal would simply help the wealthy
lower their tax burden, and they want some other tax boost for the
rich as a tradeoff.
   The two sides tried working out a deal on taxes Sunday but got
nowhere.
   Administration budget director Richard Darman proposed several
alternatives he said Republicans would accept in exchange for
dropping the capital gains tax rate, said one official. Among them
was a plan eliminating certain deductions for people with adjusted
gross annual incomes above $200,000.
   ``There was no meeting of the minds at all,'' the official said.
   Both sides agree taxes should be increased on alcoholic
beverages, luxury items such as fancy cars and electronics
equipment, energy and perhaps on cigarettes. Final details have yet
to be worked out.

<HEAD>US Firm Vows to Oppose Contract Award to Japanese Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. company that lost the bidding to build a
people-mover system for a new Japanese airport said Monday there
were irregularities in the decision that awarded the contract to
Japanese bidders.
   The dispute involves the $7 billion Kansai International Airport
being built in Osaka in western Japan. The airport project earlier
had been at the center of American complaints that U.S. firms did
not have fair access to the Japanese construction market.
   Kansai International Airport Co. conducted a briefing Monday for
the 13 bidders on why it chose Niigata Engineering Co. and Sumitomo
Corp. to build the system to carry passengers to remote gates at
the airport, scheduled to open in 1993.
   ``With the information provided to us in the meeting today, it
is clear that there were irregularities in the procurement process
of the people-mover contract for KIA,'' said John Tucker, president
of AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems, headquartered in
Pittsburgh.
   In a statement, Tucker added that ``this latest information
provided only fuels the fire of our efforts to block the award of
the project to Niigata Engineering and to pursue any avenues to
make the truth known.''
   Efforts to reach Westinghouse officials here for elaboration on
the alleged irregularities or what the company specifically planned
to do to block the contract award were unsuccessful.
   The briefing was called after Westinghouse charged that there
were violations of the U.S.-Japan construction agreement in the
evaluation and selection procedures.
   The airport company announced in July that the contract for an
automated guide-way transport system in the passenger terminal
building had been awarded to Niigata Engineering and Sumitomo. It
did not state the value of the contract.
   Company officials said Monday they had explained at the briefing
that the procedure had been fair. They added that while
Westinghouse had experience in such systems, Niigata Engineering
also was experienced in city transportation systems.
   Japan and the United States reached an agreement in 1988 on
procedures to allow American builders to bid on construction
projects in Japan, including the Kansai airport. U.S. officials
said later Japan was making significant progress in allowing
American companies to compete for construction projects.

   The stock market was mixed today under the
shadow of rising oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.20 to 2,569.31 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 488 up, 644 down and
509 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 38.50 million shares at
midmorning.
   Crude-oil futures for October delivery climbed about $1 a barrel
today, crossing $33 a barrel for the first time before settling
back a bit.
   Analysts said that intensified investors' worries about
inflation and the showdown in the Persian Gulf since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   More evidence of the inflationary consequences of rising oil
prices is expected on Tuesday, when the government reports on the
consumer price index for August.
   Analysts estimate that the CPI will post an increase of 0.8
percent to 1 percent, for its biggest monthly increase since
January.
   With energy costs continuing to advance, there isn't much hope
at present for any better news on inflation over at least the next
month or two.
   Energy stocks were steady to slightly higher. Amoco gained \ to
57{; Texaco rose \ to 64}; Chevron rose &rsqb; to 76\, and Exxon was

<HEAD>Oil Rises Above $33 Per Barrel, Sets New Record on Merc</HEAD>

   Oil futures soared above $33 a barrel today to
record levels on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, as traders
responded to bullish prices in Europe and continued Mideast
tensions.
   Light sweet crude opened on the Merc at a record $32.80 per
barrel for October delivery, surpassing the old opening high of
$32.35 that was set Aug. 2, 1983, and matched once during the
latest Persian Gulf crisis, on Aug. 23. The exchange's records for
crude date to March 30, 1983, when it began trading the oil
futures.
   In late morning trading, crude rose as high as $33.10 before
dipping back under $33 but stayed well above the old record. The
October crude contract closed at $31.76 a barrel on Friday.
   Other contract months for crude were all higher as traders
responded to bullish prices of Brent Blend, a European oil that
moved up in the wake of a pipeline cutback in the North Sea and
rumors of an unscheduled pipeline repair in the Soviet Union.
   Oil markets have been swinging so wildly since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2 that traders took it in stride as oil leaped to a
new record price.
   ``I think the move was `There goes that, so let's shoot for the
next target,''' said trader Ed Kevelson, with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``$32.35, which seemed like a pretty tough level to get to,
just evaporates this morning.''
   Kevelson said traders were also reacting to news that Iran and
Iraq had stopped exchanging prisoners, despite their recent
conciliatory moves that have included the re-establishment of
diplomatic ties. Traders were also following reports that pro-Iraqi
groups might try to move food and medicine into Iraq, despite the
blockade of Iraq that was imposed after its troops occupied Kuwait.
   ``I think any test of the blockade is very bullish at the
moment,'' Kevelson said.
   The price of crude opened so high on the Merc in response to
prices of Brent, which was trading up about $1.30 per barrel today,
said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Brent prices were higher in part because of a North Sea pipeline
problem that was keeping about 70,000 barrels per day off the
market. European oil prices were also higher because of a rumor
that unscheduled repairs would be held on a Soviet pipeline from
the Ural Mountains to the Caspian Sea, although traders said the
Soviets issued a statement this morning that was construed as a
denial of the rumor.
   ``That kind of took a little bit of wind out of the market,''
Hittle said.
   When Brent is trading at a premium, supplies that normally would
go to the United States are often kept in Europe, which can help
push up prices of the light sweet crude futures traded on the Merc,
Hittle said.
   Rising oil prices were accompanied by higher prices for
petroleum products futures.
   Unleaded gasoline was up 2.94 cents to 93.30 cents per gallon on
October contracts, while home heating oil was up 2.91 cents to
85.70 per gallon on October contracts in late morning trading.
Distant months were all higher for the products.
   Natural gas stayed the same at $1.52 per 1,000 cubic feet for
October delivery, although later months were slightly higher.

   A national energy policy promoting the
use of coal could have helped prevent the Persian Gulf crisis, the
United Mine Workers' president said today at the convention marking
the union's 100th anniversary.
   ``The only reason characters like Saddam Hussein have any power
at all is because of the oil they have - oil we could have replaced
years ago with coal mined in the United States and Canada,'' UMW
president Richard Trumka said.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told the more than 1,000
delegates from the United States and Canada that unions are on the
verge of a breakthrough following the 1980s, which he called a
period of illusion, excess and frustration.
   Kirkland urged support of a bill before Congress that would bar
employers from permanently replacing striking workers.
   ``That's a basic right recognized in all but the most backward
or repressive nations,'' he said.
   The UMW rejoined the AFL-CIO last year, four decades after the
famed UMW President John L. Lewis pulled his union out.
   Other speakers scheduled to address the delegates include the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   The celebration of the once-powerful union's centennial is mixed
with financial and legal concerns.
   During the nine-day meeting, delegates will be asked to give the
International Executive Board, the UMW's governing body, authority
to close or merge the 21 local districts to help the union save
money. Several of the largely autonomous districts are insolvent
because of layoffs.
   They also will decide whether to allow the governing body use of
interest earnings from the $60 million strike fund to pay legal
expenses and other costs associated with strikes. Currently, the
fund can be used only to pay benefits to strikers.
   And the delegates will be asked to approve changes UMW leaders
say they need to deal with multinational corporations in the world
coal market.
   Trumka and other union officials say the proposals will give the
union the latitude to deal with coal companies that increasingly
are owned by conglomerates such as Exxon and Du Pont.
   The convention at the opulent Fontainebleau Hotel comes as the
UMW struggles to overturn $52 million in fines levied by a Virginia
judge because of the 10-month Pittston strike in 1989. The union
also faces more than $1 billion in lawsuits filed by companies
idled by a five-week wildcat strike that began in sympathy with the
Pittston strikers.
   The union declared victory in the bitter Pittston strike, but it
was a costly win. A financial disclosure form shows the union's net
worth fell by $45 million in 1989, down to $126 million.
   The UMW, formed in 1890 by the merger of two rival mine unions,
once held a firm grip on the nation's energy needs. As late as the
1940s, its 400,000 members controlled 80 percent of the country's
coal production.
   But the union's influence has declined in recent years. Beset by
increased mechanization in the nation's mines and a jump in the
number of non-union coal operations, the UMW has seen its working
membership dip to about 70,000.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain nd soybean futures prices turned lower
after a mixed opening this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid weak export demand and forecasts for mild temperatures in the
Midwest.
   Soybean futures opened higher after some private meteorologists
predicted cold temperatures early next week in the Midwest. But the
market's focus quickly turned to nearer-term factors, including
predictions for beneficial rain in the region later this week.
   Joel Karlin, grains analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said the markets also were responding to weak export
demand across the board.
   ``Export business for all these markets is abysmal,'' he said.
``It's been really hurting the wheat and corn and it's starting to
afflict the soybeans also.''
   The impending corn and soybean harvest is likely to increase
selling interest, Karlin said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.56 a bushel; corn
was \ cent to } cents lower with September at $2.32 a bushel; oats
were unchanged to { cent higher with December at $1.14} a bushel;
soybeans were 7 cents lower to 1} cents higher with September at
$6.18 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Some pork belly futures leaped the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound in reaction to gains in
the cash hog market and strong demand for pork.
   Live cattle were .43 cent to .70 cent higher with October at
79.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .78 cent higher
with September at 89 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to 1.28
cents higher with October at 53.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.7 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 56.65
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures ended mixed on Friday; pork futures advanced.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with bargaining council meeting
rescheduled for Tuesday, add quotes from two of its members. Picks

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
reached tentative agreement early today on a new three-year
contract covering 300,000 workers in 29 states.
   ``I'm just delighted we got this contract settled without a
disruption,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said in announcing the
agreement, reached after a 41-hour bargaining session between the
union and the world's No. 1 automaker.
   Details of the agreement were to be outlined at a meeting this
morning in suburban Detroit of the union's 300-member GM bargaining
council, made up of local union presidents and bargaining committee
chairmen. But that meeting broke up after only 15 minutes and was
rescheduled for Tuesday because the printing of the proposed
contract had not been completed.
   Bieber said at a news conference before dawn that he was ``very,
very satisfied'' with the agreement on pensions, and GM vice
president Alfred Warren said the contract gives the company
latitude to reduce its work force.
   The Detroit News reported today that the contract includes a 3
percent raise the first year, 3 percent lump sum payments the next
two and retention of a requirement that GM hire one worker for
every two who quit, retire or die.
   There had been speculation that GM would push hard to remove or
alter the 1-for-2 policy and that the automaker wants to cut tens
of thousands of hourly jobs and close up to four assembly plants to
better compete with the Japanese.
   The Big Three automakers lost about 6 percentage points in U.S.
market share during the 1980s, while the Japanese gained the same
amount.
   If approved by the UAW council, the contract would be sent to
the rank and file for ratification, a process expected to be
completed by the end of the month.
   As he arrived for this morning's meeting, Tom Robinson,
president of Local 549 in Mansfield, Ohio, who helped negotiate the
settlement, said only that it ``met all the goals we came down here
to meet.''
   Earl Perry of Local 2188 in Fitzgerald, Ga., was more cautious.
``We still have to get through this one,'' he said, referring to
the since-rescheduled bargaining council meeting
   The UAW's old three-year contract with GM expired at midnight
Friday, but both sides agreed to extend its terms while talks
continued.
   UAW contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also ran
out at the same time, but the union put talks with Ford and
Chrysler on hold so that it could concentrate on GM and use that
pact as a model for the other automakers.
   Bieber and Warren said the new agreement could be tailored to
Ford and Chrysler.
   The union's contracts with the Big Three automakers cover more
than 450,000 active workers. This year was the first time in 11
years that UAW contracts with each of the Big Three ran out at the
same time.
   The last time the UAW struck GM was in 1984. That strike lasted
a week and ultimately involved about 25 GM facilities nationwide.
   Meanwhile, talks continued in Toronto between the Canadian Auto
Workers union and Ford of Canada. The CAW's 12,800 members at Ford
of Canada struck early Saturday after talks broke off.
   Negotiations were held later Saturday and resumed Sunday. No
plants involved operate on weekends so any strike impact won't be
felt until today; if the strike continued, U.S. Ford plants that
use parts made in Canada would be affected.
   Bieber, whose union's 1.5-million membership dropped by a third
largely because of the shrinking U.S. auto industry, said he
expected the tentative agreement would get a warm reception by the
bargaining council. ``Suffice it to say at this point they will be
pleased with what we have to say,'' he said.
   Warren said the talks were ``some of the most difficult
bargaining'' ever between GM and the union. But Warren and Bieber
were upbeat about the prospects for changing labor relations
between the company and union.
   ``We feel that the spirit we developed during the negotiations,
the relationship we built with the new leadership of the United
Automobile Workers bodes well for General Motors, for the customer,
the marketplace and the United Automobile Workers,'' Warren said.
   The average hourly wage with cost of living adjustments for GM
workers is about $15.75 under the 1987 agreement. Fringe benefits,
particularly health care costs, boost that to nearly $30 per hour,
the company has said.
   At Ford, the figure is about $31 per hour, and Chrysler's was
just more than $33.
   Some of the fringe benefits include pension matters, which was a
hot topic going into the talks. There was a strong movement within
the UAW to include cost-of-living adjustments keyed to the
inflation rate.

<HEAD>American Stock Exchange Plans Trading Facility in Hawaii</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Stock Exchange announced Monday it
was planning a trading facility in Hawaii in an attempt to link
U.S. and Pacific stock and options markets during the Tokyo
business day.
   The exchange set an 18-month timetable to develop a business
plan and negotiate with American and Far East financial
institutions for joint ventures that would be necessary to open a
trading facility in Hawaii.
   ``As global financial markets evolve in the 1990s there will be
the increasing demand for foreign securities by investors in both
the U.S. and Pacific rim countries,'' American Stock Exchange
Chairman James R. Jones said.
   The business day in Hawaii overlaps trading in New York and
Tokyo, the world's two key financial markets.
   The Amex is the second-largest U.S. exchange behind the New York
Stock Exchange. It recently has sought to expand into new products
and technologies that tie into the gloablization of world markets.
   The Hawaii venture is being planned with the Economic
Development Corp. of Honolulu, a nonprofit organization under
contract to the state. It represents the Honolulu Financial Center
Task Force, which is lobbying for a financial center in Hawaii.
   The Amex said in a statement that a variety of financial
products could be offered in a Hawaii trading facility, including
some not currently sold in Asian markets.

   With strong gains in California and New Mexico,
the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in the United States
rose again this week, climbing by 21 to 1,060, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported Monday.
   This week's tally reflected a smaller increase than the 26 rigs
added a week ago despite gains of 17 rigs in New Mexico and 13 in
California.
   I.C. Kerridge, a vice president and economist at Baker Hughes,
which has been making the survey ince 1940, said the Middle East
situation appeared not to be affecting the count much this week.
   A week ago, industry watchers credited the 26-rig jump to rising
oil prices triggered by the Middle East crisis.
   The count a year ago was 965, Baker Hughes said.
   In Canada, the rig count of 117 represented a jump of 20. A year
ago, the Canadian tally was 100.
   Kerridge speculated the New Mexico increase was due to drillers
working coal seam wells in the northwest part of the state. The
wells produce methane gas from coal deposits and a federal subsidy
for such wells expires at the end of the year, he said.
   The California increase followed a previous decline and
reflected an adjustment in the market, Kerridge said.
   Among other major oil-producing states, Colorado added four
rigs, while Oklahoma was up two. Kansas, North Dakota and
Pennsylvania each declined by three, while Ohio lost two and
Michigan one. Louisiana, Texas and Wyoming were unchanged.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker's rig count, a widely watched
index of drilling activity, represents the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.

<HEAD>Closes Geneva Unit, Bowing To Swiss Competitors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. said Monday it
is closing its bond trading, foreign exchange and money market
operations in Geneva because of insufficient profitability.
   Chemical was one of the most active participants in Swiss franc
bond trading but high local interest rates and the collapse of the
Tokyo stock market in recent months have hurt the bank's
activitites in the Swiss market.
   At the same time, Chemical said it was closing Chemical
Securities Co. in Tokyo, which concentrated on marketing and
brokering Japanese equities and equity-linked bonds under the
direction of the Geneva office.
   The moves were part of the American banking group's strategy to
``focus only on activities where maximum profitability can be
achieved,'' said Francois Larsen, director of the Geneva unit,
called Chemical N.Y. Capital Market Corp.
   He said the capital markets unit found it increasingly difficult
to market its service after selling its Geneva private banking
subsidiary in November 1988 to the French financial firm
Dumenil-Leble SA.
   Chemical also is closing its foreign exchange and money market
operation in Geneva, leaving a seven-person cash management branch
office of the New York-based bank in Zurich as its only Swiss
presence.
   Patrick Voegeli, the bank's head trader, said two factors hurt
profitability in the past year. High short-term Swiss interest
rates made it expensive to finance bond positions, and sharp drops
on the Tokyo stock exchange made Swiss investors reluctant to trade
Japanese equity-linked instruments.
   Chemical Bank joined Citicorp in founding the Swiss new-issues
market in the mid-1980s. Trading on the market comes before the end
of public subscription, and levels quoted there allow investors to
judge the price they are offered by potential salesmen.
   But Switzerland's three big banks increasingly dominated the
market since they began trading there in 1988.

   Pirelli SpA, the Italian tire maker, said
Monday it is seeking majority control of Continental AG of West
Germany in an apparent bid for a strong partner to face
international competition.
   A Pirelli spokesman said a merger of the worldwide tire
operations of Pirelli and Continental was considered under the
plan.
   The spokesman said Pirelli had proposed transferring its tire
operations to Continental and then taking control of the company,
creating the world's fourth-largest tire maker.
   The Italian company is controlled by the Pirelli family, which
founded it. The company also makes cables.
   Pirelli officials said the company owns a 5 percent stake in
Continental, but a spokesman said that no public tender offer for
more Continental shares would be made.
   Financial terms and other details of the offer were not
disclosed.
   Continental aknowledged it had received a proposal to merge with
Pirelli's tire business but did not clarify its position on
Pirelli's bid for control of the operations.
   The concern would double Pirelli's market share to 16 percent
from about 8 percent, with $9 billion in sales.
   The new group would rank fourth in the world tire market behind
France's Michelin &amp; Co. with 24 percent, Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co. of Akron, Ohio, with 19 percent and Japan's Bridgestone Tire
Corp. at 17 percent.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca blames
himself for the No. 3 U.S. automaker's deterioration in recent
years, particularly a botched effort to diversify and a failure to
create more popular cars.
   ``I'm confessing my sins here,'' Iacocca was quoted as telling
The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Monday.
   Iacocca, who turns 66 next month, is famous for salvaging
Chrysler from near-bankruptcy at the end of the 1970s in what
became a now-legendary comeback.
   But under Iacocca, Chrysler has weakened again, hurt by vigorous
competition particularly from imports.
   Chrysler's sales have dropped nearly 17 percent this year vs. an
industrywide decline of 5 percent.
   By some estimates, Chrysler will conclude 1990 as the fifth
biggest seller of cars in the United States, behind Japan's Honda
Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., as well as its historical U.S.
rivals, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   During a two-hour interview in his Highland Park, Mich.,
headquarters, Iacocca said he was determined to lead Chrysler
through a second comeback.
   His major failing, he was quoted as saying, was trying to
diversify Chrysler by expanding into the aerospace and defense
businesses, a strategy that GM and Ford also undertook.
   He said Chrysler's effort led to the formation of a holding
company that added a layer of bureaucracy and diverted the company
from its main business of producing new vehicles.
   Chrysler is now shedding its non-auto businesses in an attempt
to refocus on cars, but its current models are still largely
derived from the 10-year-old K-car.
   ``If I made a mistake it was following other companies, and
maybe those were grandiose schemes, Iacocca said. ``We didn't need
a holding company. That's what made us top-heavy.''
   To shore up its finances, Chrysler has undertaken a large-scale
cost reduction program, including the closing of one third of its
assembly plants in the past three years. Iacocca has ordered $2.5
billion in reductions to be made by the middle of next year.

   General Mills Inc. said Monday that profits
in its first-quarter rose 12.7 percent as the food and restaurant
company showed growth in sales of baking goods, cereals and snacks.
   Net income for the quarter ended Aug. 26 were $129.5 million, or
$1.58 a share, up from $114.9 million, or $1.39 a share, in the
1989 same period. Sales grew 16 percent to $1.74 billion from $1.50
billion a year earlier.
   The results included a $5.7 million gain from discontinued
operations. In last year's first quarter, General Mills gained $7.7
million from discontinued operations.
   General Mills Chairman Bruce Atwater told shareholders at the
company's annual meeting that he wants sales to triple by the year
2000 to more than $19 billion a year. Last year's sales were $6.4
billion.
   Separately, the company's board of directors approved a
two-for-one stock split effective Oct. 10.
   Atwater said the company's consumer foods division reported
first-quarter gains in sales and operating profits of 15 percent
and 18 percent, respectively.
   The performance was led by Betty Crocker products, Big G cereals
and international food operations. Betty Crocker benefited from
volume gains of 11 percent for desserts, 14 percent for Hamburger
Helper and other main meal mixes and more than 50 percent for
various snack food categories, Atwater said.
   General Mills' share of the $7 billion retail ready-to-eat
cereal market increased to more than 28 percent, he said.
   Restaurants reported first-quarter gains in sales and operating
profits of 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Average unit
sales increased 4 percent at Red Lobster and 6 percent at The Olive
Garden, Atwater said.

<TEXT>
   Greed motivated 10 Chicago Board of Trade soybean
traders to cheat their customers, a federal prosecutor said Monday
at the third fraud and racketeering trial stemming from an FBI
probe.
   ``The conduct of these traders is regulated to ensure that their
customers from around the world are treated honestly,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Tom Durkin said in opening arguments. ``Before you is
a group of people who decided to play by their own rules.''
   The trial follows the indictment of a clerk and 18 soybean
traders after a 1988 FBI investigation that also covered the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The clerk and other eight traders have
pleaded guilty.
   At least five defendants who have admitted guilt are scheduled
to testify in the trial along with an undercover agent who taped
conversations in the trading pit while posing as a trader, Durkin
said in court.
   ``They were confident they wouldn't get caught,'' Durkin told
the jury before U.S. District Judge George Marovich. ``They broke
the rules to make money that they are not honestly entitled to.''
   Prosecutors used large placards to explain to the jury where the
alleged crimes occurred. Visual aids also were used to describe how
soybean futures are traded.
   The soybean traders are among 48 people indicted last fall at
the world's two largest futures exchanges. Twenty avoided trial by
pleading guilty and one by pleading no contest.
   Fourteen Japanese yen traders from the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange are being tried before U.S. District Judge William T.
Hart. That trial opened last week.
   In the first trial resulting from the investigation, a jury in
July convicted two Swiss franc traders from the Merc of relatively
minor trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one of the three
defendants. The men are to be tried again on those charges next
year.

<HEAD>Media Groups Join To Acquire East German Publisher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's Bertelsmann media
group has teamed up with British publisher Robert Maxwell to take
over East Germany's largest newspaper and magazine publishing
group.
   Gruener and Jahr publishers, of which Bertelsmann owns 75
percent, and Maxwell's Mirror Group signed an agreement Friday to
acquire Berliner Verlag. The deal must be approved by an East
German government commission.
   The commission is responsible for sales of assets formerly owned
by East Germany's Communist party, Gruener and Jahr spokesman
Kristoph Keese said.
   The acquisition was first discussed in June after Maxwell
announced interest in acquiring the East German publisher and said
he wanted a West German partner. East Germany and West Germany are
to unite on Oct. 3.
   The agreement calls for Gruener and Jahr and Maxwell each to pay
50 percent of the costs of the takeover. The spokesman said the
price was between $160 million and $180 million.
   The West German company is to be the managing partner in the
joint venture, with Maxwell or one of his representatives serving
as chairman of supervisory board.
   Gruener and Jahr is a major West German publisher of newspapers
and magazines.
   A Maxwell spokesman said in London that the stake in Berliner
Verlag is being acquired by Maxwell's family-owned Mirror Group.
Among the group's publications are Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper.
   Bertelsmann is West Germany's largest media group, second in the
world only to Time Warner Inc. of the United States.
   The two newspapers and six magazines published by Berliner
Verlag are some of the most important publications in East Germany,
Keese said. They include the Berliner Zeitung morning newspaper,
with a circulation of 420,000; its evening edition, Berliner
Zeitung am Abend, circulation 135,000; and the weekly newspaper Die
Wochenpost, circulation 52,000.
   Circulation of its six magazines, which include a women's
journal, a weekly illustrated, and travel and culture publications,
exceeds 630,000.
   Separately, Munich-based Burda GmbH said it is considering
launching a newspaper in East Germany. Burda said it plans to form
a joint-venture with News International, the media group operated
by Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch.

   About 25,000 shipping industry workers
went on strike Monday in the Black Sea port of Constanta, bringing
most of Romania's sea shipping to a halt.
   The strike included ship workers, navigators, dock workers and
drivers employed by area transport services.
   Strikers claim a government program announced in June promising
higher wages, better working conditions and speedy decentralization
of industry was being impeded by government bureaucrats and local
officials.
   Adrian Tanase, an attorney and union leader of the port workers,
said the strike would continue indefinitely. He said the
navigators' union sent a telegram Monday telling all Romanian ships
worldwide to stop loading or unloading cargo.
   The Transport Ministry said the walkout was unjustified because
most of the demands have been discussed with the government and are
being studied by authorities.
   The ministry said that among the original demands made by the
unions in talks with government last week were relaxed import
rights for seamen to bring in cars, video equipment and other
luxury goods tax free into Romania.
   President Ion Iliescu met with several union leaders Monday.
   The main unions involved in the strike demanded the dismissal
and punishment of administrators who have not been able to carry
out the government's promises to workers.
   Port workers demanded that the port be turned over to private
hands, that safety standards be adhered to and that customs laws be
changed to make it easier to import goods.
   The unions also demanded a share of an estimated $215 million
worth of property formerly belonging to the pre-revolutionary trade
union confederation in Romania, which was reorganized shortly after
the revolution.
   The striking unions, which have sprung up since and are not
represented in the national council, are demanding $50 million
worth of the property.
   The navigators' union also ordered strikes in other port towns
of Galati, Braila, Tulcea and Sulina, Tanase said.

   Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. on Monday
extended its $857 million cash takeover offer for Kansas Gas and
Electric for one month.
   The utility said Kansas Gas &amp; Electric shareholders had tendered
about 13.55 million shares, or 44 percent of the company's common
stock, by last Friday's deadline. The new deadline is Oct. 19.
   Spokeswoman Joele Frank said the number of shares tendered was
smaller than a month earlier. But she said the number of
outstanding shares also had declined.
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light made its offer July 23 at $27 per
share for a total cost of $857 million. The utility said the offer
was a premium of 37 percent over the market price of Kansas Gas &amp;
Electric common stock.
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric recently began negotiations with an
unidentified company that might be interested in acquiring it.

   The stock market made little progress Monday,
restrained by rising oil prices and other inflation worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 55.44
points last week, rose 3.22 to 2,567.33.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
681 up, 768 down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 110.60 million
shares, against 133.39 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 136.06 million shares.
   Crude-oil futures for October delivery climbed $1.87 a barrel to
$33.63 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching new highs for
their summer-long upsurge.
   Analysts said that intensified investors' worries about
inflation and the showdown in the Persian Gulf since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   More evidence of the inflationary consequences of rising oil
prices is expected on Tuesday, when the government reports on the
consumer price index for August.
   Analysts estimate that the CPI will post an increase of 0.8
percent to 1 percent, for its biggest monthly increase since
January.
   With energy costs continuing to advance, there isn't much hope
at present for any better news on inflation over at least the next
month or two.
   Energy stocks were broadly higher. Atlantic Richfield gained 1}
to 141|; Amoco 1&lsqb; to 58&rsqb;; Chevron 1} to 77|; Exxon \ to 51|;
Phillips Petroleum { to 29\, and Texaco ~ to 65&rsqb;.
   Among oil service and drilling issues, Halliburton rose 1\ to
55~; Schlumberger \ to 66{; Parker Drilling } to 8}, and Baker
Hughes { to 33.
   Depressed bank stocks, by contrast, continued to struggle.
Chemical Banking fell } to 19{; Chase Manhattan } to 15~; Banc One
1&lsqb; to 22, Barnett Banks 1\ to 21, and Manufacturers Hanover &lsqb; to
25|.
   In the blue-chip industrial sector, International Business
Machines rose } to 105&lsqb; and Philip Morris edged up &lsqb; to 44~, but
Boeing dropped { to 45|; General Electric slipped { to 59, and
General Motors was down &rsqb; at 37&lsqb;.
   Barden Corp. jumped 30{ to 63 in the over-the-counter market.
The company said it agreed to be acquired by FAG Bearings for
$66.50 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.25 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .47 to 174.62.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.23 to 375.83, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.94 at 317.77.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to slide Monday as traders
anticipated a move by the the Federal Reserve to push U.S. interest
rates lower. Gold prices advanced.
   The market expected the Fed, facing growing evidence of a
slowing economy, to nudge down interest rates when negotiators
reach agreement on $50 billion in federal budget cuts, said Ronald
H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co.
   Little progress was reported from the budget talks in Washington
on Monday, but the market anticipated an eventual agreement.
   The dollar - like all other currencies - is supported by higher
interest rates. When traders sense that rates are likely to fall in
the United States, they sell dollars.
   The U.S. currency has fallen sharply in recent few months amid
continuing signs of economic weakness. The Persian Gulf crisis has
also taken a heavy toll on the dollar.
   Holzer said the dollar also fell on expectations of a widening
in the U.S. trade deficit. The Commerce Department was releasing
the July trade figures Tuesday, while the Labor Department was
announcing consumer price figures for August.
   The dollar did manage a slight gain against the Japanese yen,
rising to 136.55 yen in New York from late Friday's 136.45. In
Tokyo earlier, the dollar rose to a closing 137.00 Japanese yen
from 136.55 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 136.47 yen.
   But the dollar skidded against the British pound, which has been
boosted in part by higher interest rates. Sterling rose to $1.9140
in New York from $1.8930 late Friday. In London, the pound rose to
$1.9025 from $1.8980 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.54865 German marks, down from 1.5695; 1.2768
Swiss francs, down from 1.2990; 5.1870 French francs, down from
5.2565; 1,160.00 Italian lire, down from 1,171.75; and 1.15725
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16505.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels were: 1.5575 German marks, down from 1.5625; 1.2865 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2910; 5.2160 French francs, down from 5.2305;
1.7550 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7605; 1,165.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,166.00; and 1.1593 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1648.
   Gold rose in New York, climbing $4.30 on the Commodity Exchange
to close at $389.40 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $390.50, up $4.75.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $389.75 a troy ounce from
$385.25 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of
$389 from $385 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.41
to close at a bid of $387.37.
   Although prices rose, gold dealers in Zurich said the market's
mood remained depressed, particularly because gold appears unable
to move higher despite higher oil prices, a weaker dollar and
little excitement on major equities markets.
   At the same time, a belief that gold could surge if hostilities
begin in the Middle East is keeping the metal from dropping
sharply, traders said.
   Silver rose in New York, gaining 1.6 cents to close at $4.766 a
troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. But earlier in London, silver
fell to a late bid of $4.78 a troy ounce from $4.79 late Friday.

<HEAD>Gold Posts Strong Gain as Crude Oil Futures Hit Record High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rose strongly Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange as fears of tightening oil supplies pushed crude oil
futures to record highs, spurring some investors to buy gold as an
inflation hedge.
   But precious metal analysts said gold's gains were relatively
small compared with the advance in energy prices, suggesting the
historical relationship between the two markets has changed.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures rose
sharply, soybeans fell and grain futures advanced.
   Gold futures settled $4.20 to $4.30 higher in New York with the
spot September contract at $389.40 a troy ounce and the more
actively traded contract for delivery in October at $390.60 a troy
ounce.
   Silver futures ended 1.6 cents to 1.9 cents higher with
September at $4.766 a troy ounce.
   The rally extended to five days a runup in gold prices following
a $10.90 plunge in the September contract on Sept. 10. The contract
now has regained all but 10 cents of that amount.
   John Jonat, a precious metals trader with Deak International
Inc., said traders are focuing more on a perception that higher oil
prices and the military buildup in Saudi Arabia will send the U.S.
economy into a recession than the inflationary implications of
higher oil prices.
   ``I don't think the old relationships ... are really in effect
any more,'' ``I don't see huge investment demand for gold right now
coming to the rescue. I don't think people are rushing in to buy it
again.''
   In the absence of significant developments in the Persian Gulf
standoff, talk of a possible shortfall in Soviet crude exports
supported crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude also was supported by President Bush's statement that he
saw no need to draw supplies from America's strategic oil reserves,
said Jim Ritterbusch, an energy analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   Light, sweet crude oil futures settled 32 cents to $1.87 higher
with the October contract at $33.63 a barrel, eclipsing the
previous closing high of $32.35 on Aug. 2, 1983. Cash crude prices
reached nearly $40 a barrel in 1980.
   Wholesale heating oil futures settled .90 cent to 2.67 cents
higher with October at 85.31 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded
gasoline was 1.31 cents to 1.94 cents higher with October at 91.67
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures rose sharply on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, led by limit gains of 2 cents a pound in the
pork belly market amid reports of higher cash hog prices and strong
demand for pork products.
   Trading volume in the cattle pits is expected to drop during the
next two days ahead of a monthly Agriculture Department on
Wednesday. The report is expected to show about a 4 percent
increase over a year ago in the number of cattle on feedlots in the
seven largest producing states.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to .75 cent higher with October at
79.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .80 cent higher
with September at 89.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent to
1.13 cents higher with October at 53 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with February at 56.65
cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of Trade in a
move that some analysts attributed to weather forecasts and slow
export demand and others to a technical correction after last
week's gains.
   Corn and wheat futures rose moderately, reversing the trend of
the three previous sessions.
   After the close, a weekly USDA report showed 5 percent of the
U.S. corn crop and 1 percent of the soybean crop harvested as of
Sunday, which is slightly behind the normal pace.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 4 cents higher with September
at $2.61 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 3 cents higher with
September at $2.35} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher
with September at $1.09\ a soybeans were } cent to 9 cents lower
with September at $6.15{ a bushel.

   Heightened uncertainty in the Mideast propelled
oil futures prices up almost $2 a barrel Monday to nearly $34,
shattering the previous record and leaving traders wondering where
the market was headed next.
   ``Obviously, you've got a lot of tension building up again,''
said trader Ed Kevelson with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Speculators in the influential oil-futures market said they
believed tensions were higher because of anti-American
demonstrations in Baghdad and concerns that pro-Iraqi terrorists
might try to sneak through Kuwait into Saudi Arabia, where the
United States and allies have amassed a large military force.
   Light sweet crude, the benchmark grade of oil on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, hit an all-time high of $33.75 a barrel for
October-delivery contracts before settling at $33.63 a barrel,
$1.87 higher than Friday's close. The Monday price broke the
previous record of $32.35 set Aug. 2, 1983, which was matched one
time during the current oil crisis on Aug. 23.
   Other contract months were all higher.
   Oil's rise to the futures record was greeted calmly by traders
who have grown accustomed to wild price swings since Iraq invaded
Kuwait last month, provoking world anxiety over the availability of
oil.
   With October crude futures closing above $30 per barrel every
day last week, some had been predicting that the old record was
about to fall.
   ``I think the mood was `There goes that, so let's shoot for the
next target,''' Kevelson said. ``If this lasts longer and longer,
$40 is certainly not out of the question.''
   William Byers, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said oil's
surge above $33 could spur confusion among investors, who may have
to resort to trading on headlines.
   ``We're in uncharted territory,'' Byers said. ``You have no
context to look at the market in.''
   The cash price of oil traded at about $40 per barrel on
international markets during 1979, the last world oil jolt, but the
Mercantile Exchange's records for crude date only to March 30,
1983, when the exchange first began offering oil futures contracts.
   Cash prices represent money paid for actual oil, while the
futures prices represent a bet by traders on what oil will do based
on future supply and demand.
   Soaring oil prices had a restraining effect on other financial
markets Monday, putting a damper on stock prices and declines in
bond prices. The dollar also continued its recent slide.
   Oil's strength helped bring up the futures prices of petroleum
products, although they lagged crude.
   Home heating oil rose 2.52 cents to 85.31 cents per gallon on
October contracts. Unleaded gasoline rose 1.31 cents to 91.67 cents
per gallon on October contracts.
   Other delivery months were higher for both products.
   ``Heating oil was a little stronger, I think based on seasonal
considerations,'' Byers said.
   Natural gas went up to $1.537 per 1,000 cubic feet on October
contracts, compared with Friday's close of $1.520. Near months were
higher, while later months were lower or the same.
   Analysts attributed some of crude oil's strength to higher
prices for Brent Blend, a European oil that has been pushed up by a
cutback of 70,000 barrels per day at a North Sea pipeline.
   The high price in Europe and strong opening in New York was also
attributed to rumors of an unscheduled repair at a Soviet pipeline,
but the rumors were denied by the Kremlin.

<HEAD>Financial Printer Files for Chapter 11</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pandick Inc., a printer of prospectuses, proxy
materials and other financial documents, filed for bankruptcy court
reorganization on Monday, becoming another casualty of a business
slowdown on Wall Street.
   Pandick President James Alexis attributed the Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing to the ``steady deterioration'' of the financial
markets since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Alexis said in a statement that Pandick's business has dropped
more than 50 percent over the past two years. During that time, the
mergers and acquisition business has slowed dramatically and Wall
Street firms have cut back sharply.
   The turmoil in the financial markets since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait further curtailed the company's business and
worsened its problems, Alexis said.
   Pandick said it dismissed 725 of its 750 employees on Friday. It
filed for protection from its creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York.
   Asked whether the company would try to resume its business at
some point, Pandick spokesman Fred Spar said: ``It's really
impossible to speculate what will happen at this point.''
   Pandick joined the ranks of other big financial printers that
have foundered in recent years, including Charles P. Young Co. and
Sorg Inc.
   Alexis said the company was unable to stay afloat although ``we
took significant steps over the past two years to adjust to our
changing environment, including the sale of non-core businesses,
work-force reductions at all levels of the company and an infusion
of additional equity from our ownership group.''

<HEAD>Disney Dumps One-Hour TV Shows as Too Expensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. is dissolving its
department that makes one-hour television dramas, concluding that
even popular shows will lose money at current production costs of
$1.2 million per episode.
   Disney, which only recently became a significant producer of TV
programming, will continue to make half-hour comedies, which can be
sold as reruns more easily.
   The studio has spent heavily on writers of such comedies, giving
several contracts of more than $1 million a year.
   But executives for dramatic development are being reassigned,
although Disney will continue to produce one-hour ``Hull High'' and
``The Magical World of Disney'' segments for NBC. One or two other
projects from the department also may survive, Disney executives
said.
   Word of the decision leaked out after Disney officials began
informing agents on Friday. Disney executives, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the move Monday.
   Almost every television program is made at a deficit, as
networks are unwilling to pay the full production price. The
studios or independent producers absorb the deficit, hoping to
recoup their losses through television reruns, foreign sales and
occasional videocassettes.
   The market for one-hour shows both on the networks and in
syndication has slowed in recent years, owing to the growing
popularity of the situation comedy. A few one-hour programs -
``Hunter,'' for example - are money-makers.
   Disney's projections for the shows are so gloomy that the studio
is giving up on them despite the prestige and leverage with the
networks they can bring.
   ``The studios have been complaining about this for a long
time,'' one Disney executive said. ``Certainly the unions and the
guilds didn't believe it. Well, Disney is now saying: `Believe it.'
''
   A turning point was a show titled ``N.Y.P.D. Mounted,'' which
CBS had ordered. After looking at projected revenue figures, Disney
decided against producing the program, which is being taken over by
Orion Pictures Corp.
   The decision to abandon hour-long TV shows was a difficult one
for Disney chief Michael Eisner, whose background is in television.
Disney spent heavily over the past two years to establish itself as
a force in network programming for the first time.
   But a review of predicted revenues turned up bad news for
one-hour dramas, which cost $1.2 million or more per episode
because they are produced on film, with several cameras and
location settings.
   Networks generally pay only $800,000 to $900,000 for the rights
to broadcast each episode, and often less. TV stations have found
that viewers prefer comedy reruns during the key 4 p.m.-8 p.m. time
slots, so foreign sales must make up the difference. And even for a
successful show, those bring in only $250 million to $300 million.
   ``Disney just simply couldn't make financial sense of it,'' the
executive said. ``The numbers even in the half-hour area aren't
great. But an hour show . . . even if it's a hit for five years, we
can't make a profit.''
   Disney made six one-hour pilots last year, of which two
initially were picked up by the networks: ``Hull High,'' a high
school musical, and ``Tag Team,'' about pro wrestlers-turned-cops,
which ABC ordered and then dropped three months later.
   Disney has encountered similar difficulty with its local
television station, KCAL-TV. Broadcasting a three-hour block of
primetime news, KCAL has attracted sparse viewership and negative
reviews.

<HEAD>Turner Broadcasting Vet Named to Top Post at Whittle
Communications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A longtime top executive with Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., Gerry F. Hogan, has resigned to become a
vice chairman at Whittle Communications, Chairman Christopher
Whittle announced Monday.
   Hogan, 44, has been associated with Turner Broadcasting founder
Ted Turner for 19 years during which he helped Turner build one of
the nation's most formidable cable television operations.
   Hogan has been president of Turner Entertainment Networks since
November 1987, presiding over the 1988 launch of Turner Network
Television, the largest startup network in the history of cable
television.
   TNT started with 17 million subscribers and has since grown to
49.6 million subscribers, making it cable TV's fastest growing
network as well.
   Hogan also was responsible for the operation of TBS
SuperStation, the Atlanta-based television outlet that is the
cornerstone for Turner's cable TV empire which also includes Cable
News Network and CNN Headline News.
   Whittle described Hogan in the announcement as ``one of the most
important influences in the development of cable television as a
significant medium in the 1980s.''
   Hogan worked his way up in Turner's organization, signing up in
1971 as an ad salesman for WTCG, the Atlanta station that became
TBS SuperStation. In the past few years, he has been one of
Turner's closest aides.
   ``Gerry has played an important role in the success of our
company,'' Ted Turner said in a statement. ``We wish him well in
his new endeavor.''
   A spokesman for Turner Broadcasting said no decision has yet
been made on Hogan's successor.
   Hogan's departure is the third major executive defection from
Turner Broadcasting in the past 13 months.
   In August 1989, Robert J. Wussler, a senior executive vice
president who had been with Turner for 10 years, resigned to head
Comsat Video Enterprises, a Washington-based company investigating
the use of Direct Broadcast Satellite technology to transmit
programs directly to receivers in the home.
   Hogan joins another Turner executive, Farrell Reynolds, who
joined Whittle in May as head of its educational division, which
handles media properties designed for school use. Reynolds had been
president of Turner Broadcasting Sales Inc.
   Whittle Communications is much smaller than Turner - its
revenues amount to about $230 million compared with Turner's $1.2
billion. But Whittle is viewed as one of industry's innovators.
   Based in Knoxville, Tenn., and 50 percent owned by Time Warner
Inc., Whittle specializes in creating out-of-home media that enable
advertisers to reach precisely defined audiences.
   Whittle has developed, for instance, the commercially sponsored
Channel One news show designed for use in high school classrooms,
magazines developed specifically for doctor's waiting rooms,
ad-sponsored posters that hang in school lobbies and medical
waiting rooms and books with ads placed inside.
   At Whittle, Hogan will oversee five business areas: Whittle
Private Media, Hispanic Media, American Style magazine for beauty
parlors, Whittle Regional and Whittle International.
   In addition, he will head three confidential development
projects.
   Hogan will be one of three vice chairman at Whittle, each
reporting to founder Chris Whittle. The others are Alan Greenberg
and Laura Eshbaugh.
   In a telephone interview, Hogan said felt he had ``taken it as
far as I could take it'' with TBS and felt Whittle offered new
challenges.
   ``You can't build new and exciting bsuinesses every day in a
maturing industry,'' he said.
   At the same time, he said he felt he had assembled a strong
management team at Turner Broadcasting that could continue its
growth.
   In addition to his posts at the two Turner entertainment
networks, Hogan had been responsible for the company's public
relations, advertising and promotion and research departments, an
in-house film production uinit and a publishing division.
   He had previously been vice president for advertising sales at
TBS and was president of Turner Broadcasting Sales Inc., a wholly
owned TBS susbidiary in charge of nationwide ad sales efforts for
TBS, CNN and Headline News.
   Although Whittle Communications has attracted increasing
attention in recent years, the company actually will celebrate its
20th anniversary later this year. It employs 1,000 people.

<HEAD>Europeans Warn Vote in Congress Threatens World Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for 12 major European countries
warned Congress on Monday that passing a bill to limit U.S. imports
could threaten world talks aimed at increasing trade and cutting
subsidies to farmers.
   A House vote was scheduled for Tuesday. The bill would limit the
increase of imports of shoes, clothes and other textiles to 1
percent a year.
   Supporters said it would halt a loss of jobs and business in
this country. Opponents maintained it would show the United States
to be unwilling to join a freer world trade system.
   Andreas van Agt, ambassador of the European Comunity, said
passage of the legislation ``would be tantamount to eliminating all
prospects of progress in this area and, even worse, will jeopardize
negotiations not just in textiles but in all other areas.''
   Over 100 countries are taking part in trade negotiations that
began in 1986 in Uruguay. The United States and the Europeans are
considered the most important negotiators, though a deal will not
be possible without Japan and Third World countries.
   A year-end deadline has been set for agreement, though Congress
has given the Bush administration power to negotiate until March
1991.
   Negotiators for the first time since world trade talks began
after World War II are dealing with farm subsidies, services such
as banking and air travel and ``intellectual property'' such as
books, patents and computer programs.
   These industries now provide many more jobs in the United States
and other industrial countries than the production of traded goods
addressed in previous trade talks.
   The hope is to increase the current $4 trillion worth of
international trade every year and to reduce the $250 billion that
subsidies to farmers are estimated to cost taxpayers and consumers
annually.
   President Bush has promised to veto the bill, as President
Reagan vetoed two like it. But the Senate has enough votes to
overturn a veto, though some senators could change sides after a
veto vote is issued.
   ``Passage of this bill would disrupt negotiations on rules
necessary to protect all U.S. industries from unfair trade
practices,'' Michael J. Boskin, chairman of Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers wrote in a letter to Congress.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III added in a letter of his
own that the bill would violate agreements of the United States
with countries supporting it in the Gulf crisis.

<HEAD>General Motors Plans $1 Billion for Car Parts Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said it plans to spend $1
billion in Europe over the next five years to expand industrial
capacity and research and development for its car parts division.
   The investment by the U.S. carmaker's Automotive Components
Group will include building several new production facilities in
Europe, said Mark McCabe, the group's European president.
   The money also will be used to modernize the division's 49
existing plants in Europe, McCabe said. GM expects the European
market for car parts to grow from around $60 billion at present to
$100 billion by the year 2000, he said.
   The forecast assumes that new car sales in Western Europe will
rise by 700,00 from 1990 levels to 14.2 million cars a year by
1995. Eastern European demand could add another 3.5 million cars.
   Europeans are demanding extras like power steering and air
conditioning presently sold on only a small proportion of cars in
Europe, he said. Manufacturers, meanwhile, tend to rely more on
components made by outside suppliers.
   New European Community emission standards taking effect in 1991
will boost demand for fuel injection systems, catalytic converters
and other emission control, McCabe said.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Injunction Against Voit Sports for Patent
Infringement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge barred Voit Sports Inc. from
selling its Grass Hopper golf bag, saying it is too similar to the
Eclipse bag sold by Sun Mountain Sports Inc.
   ``The great similarity between these two bags as well as
(Voit's) own advertisement . . . strongly suggests the possibility
of deliberate copying of plaintiff's product,'' U.S. District Judge
Bruce Thompson said the injunction issued late Friday.
   Aside from blocking Voit from making or distributing the Grass
Hopper bag, the judge ordered the company to deliver all unsold
bags for destruction.
   Executives with New York-based Voit would not comment on the
ruling when contacted Monday.
   Sun Mountain Sports, based in Missoula, Mont., began marketing
its Eclipse golf bag in July 1986. The bag is characterized by its
tilted stance and inside dividers designed to keep golf clubs
separate and easily accessible.
   ``We've made golf bags for a long time, and our company really
began to take off with the introduction of our Eclipse bag,'' said
Eric Reimers, founder and president of Sun Mountain Sports, said
Monday.

   Nike Inc. Monday reported a 31 percent
increase in earnings on a 38 percent rise in revenues in the three
months ended Aug. 31, despite Operation Push's call for a boycott.
   The Chicago-based civil rights group alleges Nike is not doing
enough to help blacks.
   The Rev. Tyrone Crider, executive director of Operation Push and
about 30 demonstrators interrupted the company's annual meeting
Monday. The protesters recited a prayer that criticized the
company's dealings with blacks.
   The group of almost 700 shareholders responded by chanting
``Nike, Nike, Nike . . . .'' After a few minutes, the group left
the room, shouting, ``Say no to Nike.''
   Net income for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 was $99.6 million
or $2.62 a share, an increase of 31 percent from the $75.8 million,
or $2.01 per share, earned during the same period last year.
   Revenues for the three months jumped 38 percent to $833.6
million, compared to $602.6 million the previous year.
   International revenues were up 89 percent. Revenues from
domestic athletic footwear were up 31 percent, domestic apparel
revenues 21 percent and non-athletic footwear revenues 20 percent.
   Knight said orders for athletic footwear and apparel exceed $1
billion for the first time. The orders, scheduled for delivery
between September and January, are 42 percent higher than those
taken during the same period last year.
   ``The 89 percent increase in international revenues solidly
indicates that we are beginning to capitalize on the enormous
opportunities in overseas markets,'' Knight said at the meeting.
   ``We see further worldwide growth ahead as evidenced by the 42
percent increase in futures orders for the next five months.''

<HEAD>Kodak Introduces Photographs On Compact Discs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. unveiled a product that
allows snapshots to be stored on compact discs and played back on
televisions.
   The Kodak Photo CD system digitally stores images from negatives
or slides on compact discs. The pictures can then be shown on
ordinary television or computer screens with a Photo CD player that
also plays audio CDs.
   ``This is the answer for consumers who have wanted both the
astonishing quality of 35 millimeter photography and the
convenience of digital storage, display and manipulation. Users can
enjoy traditional photographic quality, and view their pictures on
TV,'' Kodak chairman and chief executive Kay Whitmore said in a
statement.
   The system will not be available until 1992. Kodak said it made
the announcement to give other manufacturers time to develop
licensed products and software.
   Kodak introduced the Photo CD at a news conference in Tokyo
Tuesday morning. The company planned news conferences later in the
day in London, New York and Rochester.
   To use the system, film is first processed conventionally into
negatives or slides. Each picture is then scanned and transferred
into digital form, and the compressed digital image is written to a
compact disc.
   Photo customers bringing film in to a photofinisher will have
the option of ordering a photo CD along with their prints and
negatives or slides, Kodak said. Unfilled discs can be returned to
have more images added, creating ``electronic albums'' of up to 100
pictures.
   The digital pictures have the same resolution and color quality
as a film image, according to Kodak officials. Because that
resolution is 16 times greater than a regular television and four
times greater than High Definition Television formats, the
technology will not become obsolete for a long time, spokesman Paul
Allen said.
   ``We believe this will set the standard for many years to
come,'' Allen said.
   The CD player allows viewers to manipulate the picture on the
television screen by zooming in, cropping a picture or shuffling
the order.
   The company anticipates the Photo CD player will take the place
of the slide projector for group viewing of photographs, Allen
said.
   The system was developed jointly with Dutch consumer electronics
company N.V. Philips, which owns most CD patents. The Photo CD
players will be manufactured by Philips and will play either
photographic or audio CDs. Kodak will manufacture the gold-colored
photographic CDs, each capable of holding up to 100 images.
   The Photo CD player is expected to cost less than $500, and a
Photo CD less than $20.
   The photofinishing system consists of a high-resolution film
scanner made by Kodak, a computer work station and image processing
software, a Philips-made discwriter and Kodak thermal printer. The
processing system is expected to cost less than $100,000, and will
be targeted at photofinishers and possibly even mini-labs, Allen
said.
   The discs, which will be manufactured in Rochester, are
compatible with computer CD-1 and CD ROM XA readers. Kodak
officials said they expect software to be developed that will make
the system compatible with most computers.
   The company expects other uses for the system to emerge in
desktop publishing and other fields, officials said.

   The scrappy New York Post, colorful chronicler
of a troubled city, survived its own brush with extinction Monday
after its biggest union agreed to concessions to save the publisher
money.
   Members of the Newspaper Guild, representing 350 editorial,
advertising and clerical employees, voted 242-45 to approve
concessions including eliminating dozens of jobs and cutting the
workweek to four days with a 20 percent pay cut. A last-minute
sweetener offered by Publisher Peter S. Kalikow would boost
severence pay for those who agree to resign.
   Kalikow had said he would close the nation's oldest continuously
published daily and put nearly 1,000 people out of work if the
Guild rejected the offer.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote.
   ``This is not a management victory,'' he added. ``It is not a
labor victory. It is a victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the
honesty and diversity offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of the paper's 11 unions to reach
agreement with Kalikow on a total package of $27 million in cost
cuts.
   The vote followed a 90-minute meeting punctuated by boos,
applause, and speeches.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, who reports on TV and radio issues. ``But we still
have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   ``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' said reporter Peter Moses,
who nonetheless voted for approval. ``We went from the outhouse to
the tree.''
   Editor Jerry Nachman said he was overwhelmed by gratitude.
   ``They have taken a great sacrifice in order to preserve their
careers in New York journalism, their colleagues' careers and an
important New York institution,'' Nachman said.
   Union members said sentiment swung in favor of the plan Monday
afternoon when Kalikow offered to ``buy out'' those who agreed to
resign. The publisher said employees could approve the plan, then
resign by Wednesday night and receive the same termination and
severance pay as if the paper were shut down.
   Some employees had argued earlier that they might be better off
voting against the deal and taking the severance and termination
money that would come with the newspaper folding.
   ``That takes away the principal reason for a no vote,''
metropolitan editor John Cotter said of the sweetened offer before
Monday night's meeting.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, also said the Post
would not stick to its requirement that 43 jobs be severed, but
would settle for whatever number of resignations were forthcoming.
   At a news conference after the vote, Guild president Barry
Lipton said he didn't know how many would resign.
   Kalikow also has promised the unions 20 percent of the company's
stock and a representative on the board of directors.
   Kalikow said he had to have the union concessions to cut back on
losses now running at about $27 million on an annual basis. He is
believed to have lost more than $100 million personally on the
paper.
   By Friday night, negotiators for the Post's 10 other unions had
reached agreement with the company. The Guild's negotiating
committee rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but local president Barry
Lipton endorsed it and had it put up to a vote of the members.
   The package includes about $19 million in union concessions and
$8 million in other cost reductions, including management wage
cuts.
   Monday's front page asked: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN
AGAIN?''
   On the street before the vote, New Yorkers thought about life
without the city's feistiest tabloid.
   ``I love the Post. I don't like to see it go,'' said Joseph
Yedid. But he sympathized with Kalikow: ``This is New York. You
always look out for your own interests.''
   The Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and a group
of merchants. The paper had money troubles from the start, but its
fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970's as much of
its audience moved to the suburbs.
   Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch took over in 1976 and
transformed the Post from a liberal into a politically conservative
tabloid, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
lower Manhattan.
   Under Kalikow, the paper has never made money and suffered heavy
lossess on an ill-fated Sunday edition launched for a brief period
in 1989. Recently, the slump has deepened as an economic decline in
the New York City further cut advertising revenues.

<HEAD>Report: Keating, Other Former Top Lincoln S&amp;L Officials, Indicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr., former head of Lincoln
Savings and Loan, has been indicted in connection with the sale of
junk bonds issued by the failed Irvine-based thrift, according to a
report broadcast Monday.
   Keating, former head of Lincoln and its parent company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, was to be arraigned Tuesday morning
in Superior Court on charges of criminal fraud, KCBS-TV reported,
citing unidentified sources.
   The businessman was indicted in connection with Lincoln's sale
of more than $200 million in now virtually worthless junk bonds to
22,000 investors, many of whom were elderly, according to the
report.
   The indictment would represent the first criminal charges in the
Lincoln case. Numerous civil lawsuits have been filed.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner declined to confirm the report, but
issued a statement saying his office had completed its presentation
to a special grand jury investigating the matter.
   ``Since grand jury proceedings are confidential, the district
attorney's office will not comment until such time the court lifts
the seal of confidentiality,'' the statement from Reiner's office
said.
   The grand jury began investigating in February whether Lincoln
officials misled bond buyers into believing the high-risk bonds
were federally insured. The district attorney had been presenting
evidence since April.
   The government seized control of Lincoln in April 1989.
Regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as $2
billion. Federal and state prosecutors also were not in their
offices.
   Last month, a federal judge in Washington upheld the government
takeover of Lincoln, saying the operation of the thrift by Keating
and others ``amounted to looting.''
   On Monday night, Shirley Lampel, one of the disaffected
bondholders, responded to the report of the indictment, saying: ``I
don't know how many bondholders are out there . . . but they're
dancing in the street tonight.
   ``We'd like to get our money back,'' she added.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin dismissed Keating's suit to
recover the collapsed thrift and said it was ``abundantly clear''
Keating and other officials abused their positions.
   Keating could not immediately be reached for comment. The Los
Angeles-and Chicago-based attorneys representing Keating were not
in their offices after business hours.
   Under a recent agreement announced by the Justice Department,
Keating must tell the Office of Thrift Supervision 48 hours in
advance of any transactions exceeding $5,000. Keating already has
provided financial statements, which have not been disclosed.
   Those terms had previously been imposed on Keating by a
preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles. The announcement indicated he had agreed to them.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT total increase to 9.72 percent</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World, Northwest and United joined other
major airlines Monday in imposing an additional 4.2 percent fare
increase that will raise domestic tickets by a total of 9.72
percent since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The higher rates go into effect on Oct. 1 as airlines try to
recoup some of the extra money spent on jet fuel, which has risen
by about 50 percent since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Last month, airlines boosted domestic fares by 5.3 percent to
partially offset the higher fuel costs.
   The latest round of increases bring the industry's major players
to the same levels of higher fares.
   TWA spokesman Jim Faulkner said airlines will not be able to
recover all of the costs they have absorbed recently, as passengers
have used up old, cheaper tickets while flying on planes that used
the more expensive jet fuel.
   Airlines were unsure whether they will be catching up with the
higher costs once the higher rates go into effect.
   ``That's beyond our speculative abilities, because it requires
seeing into the brain of Saddam Hussein and we don't have that
capability,'' Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said.
   The second wave of fare increases was begun by Pan Am, which
announced a 4.4 percent increase on top of its earlier increase.
   Airlines that responded last week with announcements of
additional 4.2 percent fare increases included American, America
West, USAir, Delta and Eastern.
